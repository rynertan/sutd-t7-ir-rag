## Description
Aluminum to Aluminum Ohmic Contacts, Multilevel InterconnectionsField of the Invention The invention relates to the manufacture of semiconductor chips including metallization layers, and to the product thereof having improved ohmic contacts between said layers.Background Art No prior art is known.Brief Description 9f the Invention The invention comprises a novel product for improving the ohmic contacts between aluminum metallization layers fabricated onto a chip during processing. At least one of the elements calcium, cesium and magnesium selected from Group IIa of thePeriodic Table having the potential to reduce aluminum oxide is added to the aluminum comprising at least one of said metallization layers, such that the exothermic heat of reaction to the added minor constituent and the aluminum oxide is sufficient to get rid of the aluminum oxide barrier and cause intimate aluminum to aluminum film contact for lower resistance connections.The aluminum adjacent the silicon oxide of a silicon substrate may include silicon for better binding and the addition of from 0.2 to 10 percent of the magnesium minor constituent is sufficient to generate sufficient heat of reaction for the purposes herein intended without interfering with the characteristics of the aluminum.Brief Description of the Drawing A single figure illustrates two layers of aluminum metallization on a silicon substrate with metallization contact. Description of a Preferred Embodiment In the preferred embodiment, of the order of one percent magnesium is added to the aluminum to provide the desirable characteristics of the subject invention. The uses, advantages. and examples of fabrication for the process and product follow hereinafter. In order to exploit fully the increased density and performance attainable by VLSI geometries 3 microns , it is shown that a multilevel process provides less stringent requirements on metal width and spacing and allows greater flexibility and density in circuit layout designs. In addition, RC losses resulting from increased line resistance are reduced, thereby improving performance. The use of aluminum as the interconnect metal for IC fabrication is widespread throughout the industry and is preferred by manufacturers because of its simplicity, cost effectiveness, and reliability. The development of an all aluminum multilevel metal has not been commercially realized, primarily because of the native oxide formed between first level and second level metal. This film of aluminum oxide prevents consistent reliable ohmic contact between aluminum films.Aluminum does, however, make excellent contact to silicon for two reasons first, adequate solid solubility in silicon and second, the ability to react with silicon dioxide at sintering temperatures, according to the reaction 3 SiO2 4 Al 3 Si 2 At203 220 millijoules Kinole SiO2This strong exothermic reaction dissolves the thin film of SiO2 between the silicon and aluminum, thereby insuring consistently good contacts normally achieved with aluminum. One can apply this same approach to aluminum aluminum contacts by incorporating an element which will react with A1203 in the metal film. Thermodynamic Considerations Assuming the reaction between a metal and an oxide takes place at constant temperature and pressure, the change in Gibbs free energy, AG, is given by AG AH TAS where AH is the change in enthalpy heat of reaction at temp T andAS is the change in entropy. For the case of temperature ranges not to exceed 4500C at one atmosphere and the metals under consideration, no volume or phase changes are anticipated on reactants or products, thus AS o. The change in free energy aG is thus approximated by a change in enthalpy AH during the reaction.If AH is negative, the reaction is thermodynamically possible, and the magnitude is a measure of the spontaneity of the reaction. A survey of the thermodynamic data was made to determine if certain elements would undergo an exchange reaction with oxides of aluminum and if so, would the system be of practical value for the intended application, i.e., lower contact resistance between aluminum layers. Table I lists the standard free energy of formation values afro in Kcal g mple of various metal oxides considered to be possible candidates for this application. Table I.

Heats of reaction were calculated using the data fromTable I assuming a reaction between aluminum oxide and the element.These results are shown in Table II. Table II.

Their use in a metal system, however, will depend upon favorable metallurgy using aluminum. Some insight into the selection of an alloy system can be obtained by examining the physical properties of the elements and the binary phase diagrams. This study reveals that Al Ca,Al Ce, and Al Mn form strong intermetallic compounds and exhibit virtually no solid solubility range. An Al Mg system does have solid solubility 10 Mg in Al .Moreover, the intermetallic phases ss and y were difficult to detect, suggesting that the heat of formation is low enough not to inhibit the desired reaction with the oxide. Mg was selected as a test alloy with aluminum in the following example because of these reasons and the ready access of Al Mg alloys.Example The alloy composition chosen for experimentation was aluminum, 1 wt Mg. The alloy was obtained at 99.999 purity. Films were deposited from this source by d c sputtering techniques at 1 micron pressure in argon. The test vehicle used to evaluate contact reliability was the contact portion of the process integrity chip used to evaluate aluminum to silicon contacts. This array has provisions for a total of 14,400 contacts arranged in a series string.Electrical tap offs are provided to enable intention at progressively larger numbers of contacts. The samples were prepared in following manner A thermal oxide of approximately 7000 angstroms was grown on 3 incii p type silicon wafers. This silicon oxide serves as an insulating layer to the bulk substrate. Next, a layer of 8000 angstroms of aluminum silicon 1 was sputtered on top of the oxide.This metal layer was then patterned and etched. After cleaning i.e., stripping resist, etc. , a layer of 4000 angstroms of aluminum magnesium 1 was deposited. Next, a sintering step at 5000C in forming gas was performed. Then the second level of metallization was patterned and etched. The resulting structure exhibited roughness of the aluminummagnesium film. This texture is believed to result from the condition of deposition rather than a property of the alloy. This structure is the most simple and direct way of enlisting metal tometal contact resistance by eliminating other variables, such as residues left from the insulating oxide, photoresist, etc. The overall contact area was 3 x 3 micrometers and the contact resistance was estimated to be less than O.ln per contact. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is pictured in the single figure, wherein a p type wafer of silicon 1 has a silicon oxide layer 3 formed thereon and patterned to leave an opening 5 to the surface of the silicon. Next a layer of aluminum magnesium silicon 7 was sputtered over the layer 3 to provide contact to the silicon through the opening 5. Next, a dielectric layer 9 is laid down over layer 7 and comprises, for example, polyimide. This layer was patterned to leave the opening 11 to the metallization layer 7. Fianlly, a cross connector 13 of aluminum magnesium was laid down in the area of opening 11 to establish the aluminum oxidefree contact 3 connection between layers 13 and 7 due to the magnesium of either layer reacting with the aluminum oxide during sintering to create the exothermic heat which removes the aluminum oxide film to permit the intimate contact or low ohmic junction provided by this invention. Several wafers were tested for continuity. These wafers came from different lots processed at different times. On the test wafers, the percentage of completed contacts was substantially higher than without magnesium additives to the aluminum. Uniformity within a wafer and from wafer to wafer is very good.The measured resistance for the entire chain is approximately 60a. From this one can calculate the amount of contact resistance to be less than 0.1 a. This may be contrasted with unreliable contacts exhibiting up to several hundred ohms. The two lots processed have shown excellent and repeatable results. The ease of implementation and the process compatibility with standard processes makes this process extremely attractive for double metallization procedures on VLSI. What is Claimed Is
