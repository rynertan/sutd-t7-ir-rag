# Pressure sensitive adhesive sheet structure having relocatable properties.

## Abstract
A pressure sensitive adhesive sheet structure hav ing relocatable properties composed of a pressure sensi tive adhesive layer and non adhesive solid particles characterized in that non adhesive hollowless solid par ticles having a diameter smaller than the thickness of the adhesive layer and an average diameter of less than 10 Âµ are randomly uniformly distributed over the surface of the adhesive layer, or are randomly uniformly dis tributed and partially or fully embedded in the surface layer of the adhesive layer.
