# PORTABLE CONTROL BOX FOR NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED MACHINE TOOLS

## Abstract
Remote control of a computer numerically controlled CNC machine tool is facilitated by an intelligent portable control box coupled to the CNC machine tool through a radio frequency link, typically taking the form of a single conductor coaxial cable. The portable control box includes a transmit receive circuit and a plurality of input devices and output devices, the transmit receive circuit, the input devices and output devices all being coupled to, and controlled by a microcomputer. Information from the CNC machine tool indicative of machine tool operating conditions is transmit ted across the RF link in the form of carrier keyed radio frequency signals to the portable control box. The transmit receive circuit demoduiates the carrier keyed signals and in accordance with the demodulated signals supplied thereto from the output transmit receive circuit, the microcomputer renders the output devices operative to display machine tool operating characteristics. Operator commands in response to displayed machine operating conditions are entered through the input devices and are transmitted to the microcomputer which controls the operation of the transmit receive circuit accordingly to cause the transmit receive circuit to transmit carrier keyed radio frequency signals indicative of the operator entered commands to the CNC machine tool.
