# Liquid aspirator vacuum attachment.

## Abstract
A liquid aspirator which may be connected to a conventional vacuum cleaner has two separate body parts. The rear body part is provided with an extended tube into which can be inserted a hose from a conventional vacuum cleaner. Also the rear body part holds a cartridge which contains a filter and a filter support where liquid is filtered. The front body part acts as the liquid reservoir and is provided with a tube connected to the front nozzle of the front body part. The tube extends along the top of the front body part and protrudes through the filter cartridge to the back of the rear body part. The liquid aspirated by suction of the vacuum cleaner is discharged to the rear of the assembled unit. The filter cartridge slows down air and water speed and distributes liquid to the front liquid reservoir.
