# Modified polyolefin composition.

## Abstract
A modified polyolefin composition comprising A 50 to 99 parts by weight of a modified polyolefin having an intrinsic viscosity η of 0.5 to 10 dl g and a degree of crystallization of at least 20 selected from the group consisting of polyolefins modified with styrene type hydro carbons, polyolefins modified with unsaturated epoxy com pounds, polyolefins modified with unsaturated silane com pounds, halogenated polyolefins and hydroxyl group containing polyolefins, and B 1 to 50 parts by weight of a thermoplastic polymer selected from the group consisting of B 1 thermoplastic polymers having a flexural modulus of less than 100 kg cm², a glass transition temperature Tg of not higher than 0 C and a weight average molecular weight
