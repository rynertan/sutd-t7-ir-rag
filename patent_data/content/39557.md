# Electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell is shown wherein anode 13 of a reactive metal having an insulating film 14 thereon is separa ted from cathode 12 by a non conductive flow screen 19 . A porous, expandable element 20 is positioned between screen 19 and cathode 12 to maintain essentially uniform dimensions of the electrolyte flow channel defined by screen 19 as the anode is consumed during cell operation. Prefera bly, when a multiplicity of cells are electrically connected to gether, a plurality of separator elements 21 between the re spective anodes and cathodes are utilized to ensure that each cell in the multi cell configuration is subject to essentially iden tical compression forces in assembly and during discharge.
