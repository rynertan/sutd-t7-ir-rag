# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO MULTI CONDUCTOR ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS AND METHODS OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
A laminated multi conductor connector 10 having a plurality of free standing metal terminals 12 with oppositely facing nested surfaces 16a, 16b and circuit board tails 20 for electrically engaging the printed circuit board 44 2 . Dielectric material 30 is disposed between adjacent nesting surfaces 16a, 16b of the terminal body in such a manner so as to insulate the nesting surfaces of adjacent terminals 12 and to form a continuous mutually supported stacked array of terminals 12 when mounted to the printed circuit board 44 .
