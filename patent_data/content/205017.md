## Description
This invention relates to an improved novel low styrene emission vinyl ester resin formulation which exhibits desirable adhesion characteristics in fiber reinforced applications. Vinyl ester resins hereinafter VER are useful in corrosion resistant applications such as pipes, vessels, scrubbers and smoke stacks. Also, VER are utilized in the fabrication of glass fiber reinforced products. The VER are admixed with styrene as a reactive diluent to reduce the viscosity of the VER. The presence of styrene in the VER composition results in the emission of styrene vapors into the work atmosphere. Due to the increased attention given to styrene from the industrial hygiene point of view, several methods of reducing the styrene emission have been described in the art. One such method, described in Nylander, U.S. Patent No. 4,201,826, includes the addition to the unsaturated polyester styrene composition of a film forming additive such as paraffin wax to inhibit the vaporization of the styrene. Although the paraffin wax provides a desir able decrease in styrene vapor emission, it has been found that the paraffin wax additive results in a substantial loss in the adhesive properties of the VER to the reinforcing medium. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a low styrene emission VER composition which exhibits adhesion properties comparable to or improved over a VER composition without the paraffin wax additive. The present invention stems from the dis covery of the benefits of a drying oil, soluble at least in part both in the vinyl ester resin and in the paraffin wax, as an adhesion promoter in a VER com position wherein the styrene emission has been inhi bited by the presence of paraffins in the VER com position. The VER composition is improved by the addition of an adhesion promoter in the form of a drying oil soluble at least in part both in the vinyl ester resin and in the paraffin wax. The present invention also provides a desir able low styrene emission VER composition which is capable of utilization in the fabrication of a range of fiber reinforced plastic structures and equipment. The present invention relates to low styrene emission, VER composition containing 1 a VER which is an esterification product of a polyepoxide and monounsaturated monocarboxylic acid 2 styrene as a reactive diluent 3 paraffin as a styrene emission inhibitor and 4 a drying oil, soluble at least in part both in the vinyl ester resin and in the paraffin wax. The said drying oil is present in an amount sufficient to increase the adhesion characteristic of the VER composition with a reinforcing material used therewith. For the purpose of this invention, unless otherwise distinguished, the term VER composition means a composition comprising a VER, a reactive diluent, a styrene emission inhibitor and a drying oil as an adhesion promoter. The VER herein is an esterification product of a polyepoxide and a monounsaturated monocarboxylic acid. An early patent, U.S. Patent No. 3,179,623, describes the above reactions and resins. Further details about the resins and conditions and methods of making them can be found in the following U.S. Patent Nos. 3,301,743 3,317,465 3,377,406 3,256,226 and 3,367,992. An example of the said VER includes that VER sold by The Dow Chemical Company under the trade mark Derakane . During the fabrication of various end products from a VER it is desirable to reduce the viscosity of the VER in order to facilitate the processing. A reactive diluent is utilized to reduce the viscosity of the VER. Generally, the reactive diluent is present in amounts ranging from 25 to 55 weight percent of the VER composition depending on the monomer selected, other additives employed and other factors. Typical reactive diluents include, for example, styrene, vinyl toluene, halogenated styrenes, alkyl substituted styrenes, acrylic and methacrylic esters, and hydroxylalkyl esters of acrylic and methylacrylic acid. Most pre ferably, the reactive diluent is styrene. The physical properties of the VER compo sition comprising a VER and a reactive diluent may be modified by adding various materials to the resin. For example, inert reinforcing materials such as glass fibers and inert fillers such as calcium carbonate or kaolin clay are both commonly employed to improve physical properties of the VER composition and reduce costs. The volatility of the reactive diluent, such as styrene, results in the emission of styrene vapor from the VER composition. The present composition employs a film forming additive, i.e., paraffin wax, to inhibit the emission of styrene into the work atmos phere. The paraffin wax is preferably utilized in amounts ranging from 0.1 to 5 weight percent of the said VER composition. Most preferably, in amounts ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 weight percent of the VER composition. Preferably, paraffin wax, having an average melting point of 52 C, is utilized. The utilization of a paraffin wax as a film forming inhibitor results in effective inhibition of styrene emission. However, a drawback of the use of the paraffin wax in the fiber reinforced VER composi tions is the undesirable loss of adhesion bond strength between the fiber fillers and the VER composition. Such adhesion bond strength is qualitatively measured by examining the amount of fibers present in the break pattern of a VER laminate that has been separated. In other words, the more fibers present in the break surface, the better the adhesive bond strength of the VER composition. Where the break surface is clean, i.e., very few glass fibers, the adhesive bond strength is poor. It has been found that the utilization of a drying oil results in a low styrene emission VER compo sition which exhibits desirable adhesive bond strength to the glass fibers. The drying oils are generally catagorized by iodine value. The iodine value, which is the measure of the proportion of unsaturated bonds present, is 140 or greater for drying oils. The number represents the percentage of iodine i.e., grams per 100 grams absorbed by a substance. The drying oils are preferably glycerides, i.e. esters of the trihydric glycerol and unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acids. The glyceride is preferably linseed oil. More preferably, the glyceride is raw or boiled linseed oil. Linseed oil is produced from the seeds of the common flax plant. The approximate percent chemical composition of commercial fatty acids in linseed oil are as follows a saturated fatty acids myristic 1 percent, palmitic 7 percent and stearic 2 percent and b unsaturated fatty acids oleic 23 percent, linoleic 17 percent and linolenic 51 percent. See Kirth Othmer, It is preferable to have the said drying oil present in an amount sufficient to increase the adhe sion characteristic of a VER composition with a rein forcing material used therewith. More preferably, in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 5 weight percent of the VER composition and most preferably in an amount rang ing from 0.25 to 1 weight percent of the VER composi tion. The VER composition of this invention shows improved adhesion bond strength as compared to the low styrene emission VER base which does not contain a drying oil as an adhesion promoter. Such VER composi tions are useful in fabricating a range of fiber reinforced plastic structures and equipment by all fabricating methods. The following example is provided to illus trate the invention but is not intended to limit the scope thereof. All parts are percentages by weight unless otherwise indicated. A multilayer laminate was prepared from Derakane 411 45 using the following composition Derakane 411 45 is a vinyl ester resin sold by The Dow Chemical Company. The resin was prepared by first blending a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A having an epoxy equivalent weight of 188 and a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A having an epoxy equivalent weight of 535. Added to this reaction product were glacial methacrylic acid, tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol and hydroquinone. Then maleic anhydride was added and reacted until the carboxylic acid content was 1 per cent. Then parts of styrene containing 50 parts per million tertiary butyl catechol were added and mixed with the reaction products. The Derakane 411 45 contains 45 percent monomeric styrene. Other Derakane vinyl ester resins that can be used include Derakane 411 C 50 resin containing 50 percent monomeric styrene Derakane 470 45 resin containing 45 percent monomeric styrene and Derakane 510 A 40 resin, a brominated, vinyl ester resin containing 40 percent monomeric styrene. A three layer 12 inch by 12 inch 30.48 cm by 30.48 cm laminate was prepared containing 128 grams g 30 percent of glass fibers and 300 g of the above composition cured with 0.9 g of cobalt naphthenate 6 percent , 0.15 g of dimethylaniline and 3 g of methyl ethylketone peroxide 60 percent . In the above com position, the Derakane 411 45 contained 45 percent styrene, and the additional 4.25 weight percent styrene was used to dissolve the wax and linseed oil. The styrene loss was measured by the amount of weight loss of the three ply laminate over the period of time required for complete curing. The above laminate was found to lose 9.3 g of styrene. After the determination of the styrene loss, another three layers were added to the original laminate. The first three layers of laminate were partially separated from the second three layers of laminate by a strip of polyester film. Such a strip of polyester facilitates the prying apart of the layers in order to provide a break surface from which the adhesion bond strength may be qualitatively measured. The laminate was allowed to fully cure before it was pryed apart. The degree of adhesion bond strength between the glass fibers and the resin is judged by the amount of glass fibers present in the break pattern. The test was run on four laminates prepared in the same manner as discussed above. The more glass fibers which are present in the break surface the better the adhesion bond strength of the resin to the glass fibers. Where the break is clean, i.e., where there are very few glass fibers present, the adhesion bond strength is poor. The results are summarized below in Table I. A similar three ply laminate, using 0.1 weight percent paraffin wax P58 and 0.5 weight percent boiled linseed oil was prepared similarly as described hereinabove in Example 1.
