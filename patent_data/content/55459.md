## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION a Field of the invention A process for producing oxides using chemical vapour deposition C.V.D. which comprises obtaining simple or double oxides in film on substrate or fine powder form by the use of one kind or two kinds or more of gaseous metal 6 diketone complexes in conjunction with water vapour having bonded oxygen in quantities more than equivalent sufficient for oxidizing a metal or metals in said complex or complexes. b Description of the prior art Chemical vapour deposition processes C.V.D. have been developed as the basic technique for use in semiconductor and electronics industries and also have been very publicly known as those for producing important parts of main electronic machines. The chemical vapour deposition processes have acquired importance in not only the electronics industry but also the universe, atomic energy and flying machine industries as those for coating films on parts which are required to have properties sufficient to endure servere circumstances in the universe, atomic energy and flying machines such as thermal resistance, wear resistance and corrosion resistance, and also have remarkably progressed as those for coating films which are serviceable for improving the performances of high speed steels. Oxide films to be formed by these C.V.D. processes mainly comprise single or double oxide films. When investigating the processes for forming oxide films using known C.V.D., they are found to include a number of defects as referred to afterwards, and it can not be denied that these defects have prevented the progress of the aforesaid processes. Accordingly, it can be 1readily contemplated therefrom that a process having eliminated these defects, if appears, will be applied to surface treatment of general metals with thermal resisting materials and also will develope to wider range of fields. The fact is that metal compounds used in the known oxide chemical vapour deposit processes mainly comprise metal halides, and some new trials are being made to partly use metal alkyl and metal alkoxide. As oxidating gases there are used a mixed gas of CO2 and H2, water vapour and 2 gas, which will be summarized in Table 1 as shown below.

However, the conventional process using metal chloride is defective in that due to the presence of a HCQ containing corrosive gas the apparatus and substrate corrode to thereby hamper the direct deposition on the surface of various metals, the objects for film deposition are also resticted to those exhibiting anti corrosition properties against the high tempera ture, humid HC , further the oxides to which this process is applicable are restricted to A 2O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2 and the like wherein associated metal elements have volatile halogen compounds, and double oxides are restricted to those of Tio2 SiO2 system, ZrO2 SiO2 system and the like wherein both the associated elements have a conformably volatile halogenide.Next, reference will be made to a process using an organic metal compound as a starting material. As such a process there is enumerated one using a metal alkyl compound. This process is advantageous in that the chemical deposition temperature is comparatively low such as 350 5000C as seen from the instance of A 2O3 in Table l, as reaction gases there may be used O2 and the like and product gases are limited to low corrosive CO2 and H2O, but defective in that the metal alkyl compound used herein is extremely unstable against air and oxygen and in danger of instantly firing on contact with air, the use of the metal alkyl compound calls for attention such as its probable violent reaction with hygroscopic moisture in the course of reaction steps and is accompanied with difficulty of preparing for the starting raw material, and it is very difficult to concurrently use the metal alkyl compound with other metal halogenides for the purpose of preparing double oxides. In addition, there are known a process utilizing thermal cracking of a metal alkoxide compound used as an organic metal compound and a process utilizing steam as a cracked gas, but these processes are not put to practical use due to defects that the thermal cracking is hindered by deposition of carbon on the substrate and the like and in the preparation of double oxides by the concurrent use of the metal alkyl compound with halogenides the reaction conditions of both are in conformity with each other with difficulty. The same is applicable to a vapour treating process of alkoxide using water vapour as a reaction gas. And, the unstability of alkoxide caused by contact with air is one of the significant defects, and the fact that alkoxide is relatively unstable at a practical volatile temperature of 1002000C is also hindering the practical use of this process.In fact, there can be found no report on the actual instance of this process having used for the production of double oxides. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Various defects of the conventional processes in the preparation of simple oxide films and double oxide films have been discussed above. The process of the present invention to be referred to hereinafter is one capable of eliminating a number of defects inherent in aforesaid conventional processes, and solving a plurality of problems remaining unsolved in the field where the conventional processes are now being used practically for the purpose of synthesis of simple or doubleoxides by virtue of chemical vapour deposition, for instance, such as the difficulty, generation of corrosive gas, height of a deposition temperature and the like, whereby the direct deposition on the metal surface can be attained almost in every case. The process of the present invention is also one capable of facilitating the deposition of double oxides to a high degree.In other words, the process of the present invention may be said to be one providing a novel means for preparing films of double oxides of metals, Mn, Zn, Fe, Mg, Ba, etc., studies of which have been retarded because their halogenides are low volatile, such as MnO Fe2O3 system, MnO ZnO Fe203 system, MgO Fe203 system, Y203 Foe 203 system, Fu2 0 3 Fe2 0 3 system, BaO TiO2 system, Y2O3 ZrO2 system, and the like, and further contributing largely to the development of the range of application of chemical deposition process. It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing a thin film sensor by using chemical vapour deposition. It is is considered that the conventional processes for worming oxide films by means of chemical vapour deposition are cha ac terized in that every deposition reaction is carried out basically in the manner of extending the reaction caused in normal temperature liquid phase even into high temperature gaseous phase as seen in the reaction of AQCQ3 with water and the reaction of alkoxide with water respectively, and have studied and determined the conditions for chemical deposition in the gaseous phas. Much of metal ss diketone complexes is stable on contact with water at normal temperatures. Probably due to this, study ias scarcely been made on the reaction of metal ss diketone complex with a reaction gas, i.e. water vapour. Rather, study has been made mainly on the oxidating reaction using oxygen at a temperature of 800 10000C. However, it has been proved from the inventor s study results that the oxidation by oxygen is poor in reproducibility and the chemical vapour deposition at a temperature of 80 8000C, preferably 350 8000C as expected by the inventor can in no way be attained. In view of this, the inventor has carried out fundamental studies on the reactions of ss diketone complex with various gases. As the result of having carried out chemical vapour deposition by using ss diketone complex and gases such as oxygen, air, CO21 H2, N2, water vapour, argon and the like, the inventor has confirmed that the reaction by oxygen does form no thin film and rather is harmful to the thin film formation, and further has ascertained that steam is the most effective reaction gas. The inventor has made collective investigations on the reactivity of both metal ss diketone complex and water vapour with both carried in an inert carrier gas for the purpose of obtaining a process capable of achieving a stable chemical deposition at a relatively low temperature of 80 8000C, preferably 350 800 C on the basis of the above obtained results. Needless to say, the present invention permits to attain said stable chemical deposition at higher temperatures. First, the inventor has investigated the synthesis of ssdiketone complexes of heavy metal elements such as AQ, Ti, Mg, tuba, Zr, Zn, Mn, Fe, Y, Eu and the like to confirm that the synthesis of metal ss diketone complexes which are of volatility usable for chemical vapour deposition at a temperature less than 2800C can be attained in any case and that when a mixture, obtained by mixing an inert carrier gas carried ss diketone complex therein with water vapour to such an extent that the ratio of bonded oxygen contained in the water vapour to metal atoms contained in ss diketone may be more than equivalent to form an oxide on which chemical vapour deposition is made, is contacted with a heated substrate on which a film is formed, the corresponding oxide deposits almost in a fixed quantity.In addition thereto, the inventor has confirmed that the deposition of oxide fine powder can be obtained by allowing said mixture to pass through a heated electric tubular furnace in place of contacting it with the heated substrate. The present invention provides a process for producing oxides using chemical vapour deposition which comprises forming an oxide film on a substrate by mixing one kind or two kinds or more of gaseous metal ss diketone complexes with water vapour having bonded oxygen in a quantity more than equivalent sufficient for oxidizing a metal or metals contained in said complex or complexes, with both carried in a carrier gas, and contacting the resulting mixed gas with said heated substrate. The present invention also provides a process for producing oxides using chemical vapour deposition which comprises forming oxide fine powder by mixing one kind or two kinds or more of gaseous metal ss diketone complexes with water vapour having bonded oxygen in a quantity more than equivalent sufficient for oxidizing a metal or metals contained in said complex or complexes, with both carried in a carrier gas, and passing the resulting mixed gas through a heated electric tubular furnace. Said heating temperatures ordinarily may be 800C or more, preferably 3500C or more. Particulars of the reaction mechanism between water and ss diketone complex are not confirmed clearly yet. However, there is no possibility.of the apparatus and substrate being corroded because the metal ss diketone complex once forms a hydrate which decomposes on the surface of the substrate into metal oxide, CO2, hydrogen and hydrocarbon and, when the mixing ratio of water vapour is great, mainly into CO2 and H2. Furthermore, a double oxide having a desired molar ratio can readily be obtained by mixing another metal ss diketone complex with an inert carrier gas so as to have a predetermined molar ratio and reacting the resulting mixture with water vapour in accordance with the abovementioned standard. Still further, it has been confirmed that when the molar ratio of a highly volatile metal halide to metal ss diketone complex whose halogen compound is too low in volatility to be used in chemical vapour deposition is set to a predetermined ratio in the presence of a required carrier gas and both metals are reacted withwater vapour, a double oxide, which has not been fully studied upto now, can be prepared in the film or fine powder form at a low temperature of 80 8000C, preferably 350 to 8000C, and in a fixed quantity by means of chemical vapour deposition. As is evident from the aforegoing, the present invention should be said directed toward a process capable of eliminating the defects inherent in the conventional C.V.D. processes and exhibiting various superior characteristics. Although the process of the present invention is considered to have a wide application range, explanation will be made on one instance where said process is applied to the production of a thin film sensor. The fact is that printing and sputtering processes have been employed widely for the purpose of producing sensors by using thick film or thin film oxide semiconductors. However, both processes are defective. In more detail, the formtH s complicated steps and the latter is unsuitable for mass productior First of all, taking into consideration the thermistor manufacturing process as one instance of the printing process publicly known as the process for the production of thick film sensors, it is found that the manufacturing process comprises a step for preparing thermistor powders, a step for preparing a thermistor paste and a printing step and is not simple. The preparation of thermistor powders comprises a series of steps of mixing, calcination, pulverizing, forming, baking and pulverizing of the raw material powder.Next, RuO2 or glass first is mixed with said thermistor powder, and then an organic vehicle is added to the resulting mixture and mingled, whereby there can be obtained a thermistor paste. Further, the thermistor paste and electrodes are printed on a substrate, and the same is baked at a high temperature of about 8000C, thereby completing a thickfilm thermistor. In the case of the printing process described above, however, there is fixed the limitation in pulverizing the oxide sensor, thereby narrowing the scope of utility of the sensor, and at the same time the divergent, complicated manuifacturing steps bring about increased manufacturing costs. In this process, furthermore, there is no denying the presence of difficulties from the quality management that the steps of mixing, calination, etc. each exerts a delicate influence upon the characteristic of the final product thermistor. On the other hand, the thermistor manufacturing process utilizing the sputtering process also includes a heavy defect that since it is operated under vacuum, it is accompanied with large sized equipments and increased installation costs and at the same time it is unsuitable for mass production. According to our process for producing oxide films uilizing chemical vapour deposition makes it possible to produce various oxide thin films containing a wide range of oxides, which could never be produced by the conventional chemical vapour deposition process, readily by deposition at a relatively low temperature, and further to produce various sensors, including thermistor, by the combination of thus obtained oxide thin films and electrodes and by the steps simplified extremely as compared with those of the conventional printing process and the like. The process according to the present invention may include one comprising forming an oxide thin film by applying a mixed gas of complex gas and water vapour onto a substrate, on which electrodes have previously been printed and heat treated, through a suitable shaped nozzle or one comprising depositing an oxide thin film and then forming electrodes thereon. The present invention dispenses with all the pre treatment operations such as preparation of oxide fine powders and the like as described above with reference to the thick film sensor manufacturing process and permits the formation of an oxide thin film on a substrate by mixing complex gases during the transport and reacting it with water vapour in situ. Due to this, the present invention makes it possible to obtain a thin film sensor with a fine and uniform structure readily through a very few operations and further to mass produce the thin film sensors readily because they may be prepared under atmospheric conditions. As the ss diketone complexes used in the present invention there can be enumerated those having the general formula I EMI11.1 wherein M is a metal, and n is equal to the number of valences of a metal. R and R are CH3, CF3, C4Hg, C4H3S or C4H3O.

NH4 OH is added to the resulting solution slowly to precipitate hydroxide. The solution is thus neutralized. Thereafter, 0.15 mol 15.5 mQ of acetylacetone is added to the thus treated solution and the same is reflexed for 30 minutes. The solution is cooled, filtered and washed with hot water to remove unreacted acetylacetone. Finally, it is dried in a vacuum desicator. Synthesis of Y C11H1902 3 0.06 mol of dipivaloylmethane is dissolved in 30 mQ of ethanole, and put in a thick flask with a stop cock connected to an exhaust unit. Next, 2.4 gr of NaOH is dissolved in 50 mQ of 50 ethanole, and the resulting solution is poured in the flask. The reaction product is stirred continuously by means of a magnetic stirrer. To this is further added a solution obtained by dissolving 0.02 mol of Y NO3 3 6H2O in 50 mQ of 50 ethanole. Immediately, the flask is vacuumized, sealed and stirred for 2 hours. Then, it is distilled under reduced pressure until the quantity of the solution is reduced to half of its initial quantity. And, 350 mZ of a distilled water is added thereto to thereby separate a precipitate. The separated Y C11H1902 3 is vacuum filtered promptly and dried. The obtained crystals are re crystallized in vacuum from n hexane, and further vacuum dried. m.p. 177 1800C .

These gases are mixed and fed to a nozzle. At the same time, a nitrogen gas containing about 40 of a water vapour gas is fed to the same nozzle at the speed of current of 600 mQ min. The gas mixed in the nozzle was applied onto the surface of an alumina substrate, thereby forming a thoria containing tin oxide thin film. Subsequently, a ruthernium oxide thin film was formed on the other surface of said alumina substrate by using an ruthenium isopropoxide Ru OC3H7 4 gas with a water vapour gas in accordance with the same procedure as mentioned above. Further, a parallel comb platinum electrode was printed onto each of the oxide thin films formed on both sides of the substrate, thereby preparing a thin film gas sensor. The structure of the thus prepared sensor was as illustrated in Fig. 7.
