# NON NATURALLY OCCURRING ZYMOGENS AND METHODS AND MATERIALS FOR THEIR CONSTRUCTION

## Abstract
Enzymes are converted from or into reversibly inactive forms, zymogens, by mutating one or more selected wild type amino acid residues, in the enzymes into residues that are capable of chemical inactivation and reactivation. The invention particularly is useful in expressing enzymes nor mally expected to be toxic to recombinant microbial hosts in the inactive or zymogen form, after which the zymogen is activated in order to produce the functional enzyme.
