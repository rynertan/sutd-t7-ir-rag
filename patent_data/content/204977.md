In addition, a retaining, or locking, nechanism 25 see FIGURE 5 is provided on mounting bracket 26 at the front side 27 of the base portion. As best shown in FIGURES 1 through 3, a tab, or indicator, 29 is provided on rack 3D so as to be visible through the slotted openings 32 in the top 33 of lid 22. As shown in FIGURE 1, indicia 35 are also preferably utilized at the side of each slotted opening 32 to indicate the a sount of use of fluid dispensed frond syringe 37 then being driven by rack 30. As also indicated in FIGURES 1, 2, and l2,.de ressable start and stop buttons 39 and 4t, respectively, are provided at front portion 27 of base portion 21 of the casing 19. In addition, a light emitting diode LED enable flasher indicator 42 is provided at base portion 21, and anInformation plate 43 is also provided at mounting bracket 26. The now preferred embodiment of this invention is shown in FIGURES 2 through 7, and includes a disposable unit 45.Unit 45 includes syringe 37 and rack 30 both of which are mounted on retaining clip 47. Retaining clip 47 preferably receives and retains a plurality of syringes four are indicated by way of example in FIGURES 1 through 7 , and each syringe has a separate rack 36 connected with syringe piston, or plunger, 48 by means of connector 49 which receive centrally apertured piston 48 between disc 50 and end retainer 51 see FIGURE 6 . Piston 48 has sealing lips 32 for engaging the inner surface of the syringe barrel, as is conventional. As best shown in FIGURE 5, retaining clip 47 includes a mounting wall 54 having a plurality of barrels 55 formed therein to receive the rear end portion 56 of each syringe.As also shown in IGUE 5, the rear end portion 56 of end syringe has arcuate lip portions 57 at opposite sides which are received in matching portions 59 of each clip barrel 55.After insertion and upon rotation preferably about g O of the syringe about its central axis , lip portion 57 rotates behind the end of the barrel, and is thereafter locked against movement with respect to the clip until the syringe is further rotated in either direction, so that the lips are again aligned with the matching arcuate portions of the barrel. Mounting bracket 26 is attached to wall 54 and extends at one side of and parallel to syringes 37. In addition to snap fastener 35 at the top of mounting bracket 26 for retaining the lid in the closed position , bracket 26 also has a snap fastener 61 protruding inwardly toward the syringes to enable the mounting bracket to be snapped into the base portion of the casing. In addition, bracket 26 preferably has a tamper proof prescription label base 43 for receiving, as the information displayed, an indication of the prescription for medicaments to be included in the syringes retained by the clip. Rack 30 includes an elongated T shaped beam, or bar, 63, the upper, horizontally extending portion 64 of which has indicator 29 at the rear edge thereof, and the lower, vertically extending portion 65 of which has teeth 67 therein at one side 68. As can be appreciated from FIGURES 3,5 and 6, teeth 67 are relatively small and fine to better control the longitudinal movement of the beam. As shown in FIGURES 2 and 6, a series of distinguishable strips 78 are provided at side 71 of vertical portion 65 of beam 63 to sense beam positioning, as brought out more fully hereinafter. As best shown in FIGURES 2 through 4, disposable unit 45 is inserted onto base 21 at the top 73 thereof so that the syringes 37 are received in indentions 74 as mounting bracket 26 is snapped into place centrally of the base at the front thereof. Then disposable unit 45 is snapped into position, teeth 67 of each rack 3D engage pinion, or driving, gear 76, which gear extends above top 73 of the base portion of the casing.As also shown in FIGURES 4 and 6, vertical portion 65 of beam 63 extends between driving gear 76 and a pair of guide pins 77 to constrain movement of beam 63 in opposite longitudinal directions when being driven by pinion gear 76.As also shown in FIGURES 4 and 6, optical sensor 78 is positioned adjacent to guide pins 77 and thus adjacent to side 71 of vertical portion 65 of beam 63 to sense the positioning of the optimally distinguishable strips 70 on side 71. Each rack 30 is independently driven by a separate driving unit B , as best shown in FIGURE 6. As shown, a series of gears 81 are positioned between pinion gear 76 and stepper motor 82 as indicated in FIGURES 6 and 13 for enabling precise movement of the rack mechanisln 30. As also indicated in FIGURE 6, each driving unit BX is mounted in a separate gear box 84, which g ar box is positioned within base 21 of the casing below top 73. FIGURE 7 illustrates that the pistons 48 of the plurality of syringes 37 are independently driven through separate gearing 81 and separate pinion gear 76. As shown, each gear box 84 is mounted below and in line with the path of travel of beam 63 as beam 63 drives the associated piston 48 from a retracted position at the rear of the syringe to an extended position at the front of the syringe during which movement the fluid in the syringe is expelled, or discharged, from the syringe. A non disposable embodiment 88 of the syringe drive device of this invention is shown in FIGURES 8 through 11.As indicated in FIGURE 8, non disposable embodiment 88 is similar to disposable embodiment 18 as shown in FIGURES 2 through 7 , except that rack 9D is mounted within the casing. As indicated in FIGURE 8, rack 90 includes indicator 29 which is visible through the slots 32 when the lid 22 of casing 19 is in the closed position as shown in FIGURE 1 . hack 90 includes a bean, or bar, 91 having an upstanding shoulder 92 at the rear end portion which shoulder has indicator 29 mounted at the top thereof . As indicated in FIGURE 8, beam 90 has teeth 93 on one side wall. As shown in FlGUIeE 9, beam 91 preferably includes a central strip 94, which strip is within outer portion 95 of the beam. The forward end 96 of outer portion 95 of beam 91 is adapted to receive tip 97, which tip engages piston 98 of syringe 100. Tip 97 has a disc 102 thereon that has a rearwardly facing annular connector 103 extending rearwardly therefrom. Connector 1B3 has a lip 105 thereon, so that as connector 1B3 is inserted into annular groove 17 which groove has an annu1ar. boulder 1D8 at the forward end 96 of beam 91, connector 103 is snapped into the annular groove, as indicated in FIGURE lD. Alternately, the annular connector could have an inwardly directed lip which snaps over an outwardly directed shoulder on end 96 of beam 91. h smaller disc 118 i.e., smaller relative to disc 102 is parallel to and spaced forwardly of disc 1B2 by spacer 111 and terminates in guide 112 which extends forwardly of disc 116 for engaging piston 98. Disc 110 and guide 112 are insert into piston 98 of the syringe piston unit, as shown in FIGUi 18 when the syringe is operatively positioned on the non disposable unit. In this embodiment, only the syringe piston unit is inserted into and removed from the syringe piston unit. As indicated in FIGURES 10 and 11, outer portion 95 of beam 91 can be retracted with respect to inner portion 94 to enable release of the rack from a syringe piston unit. As shown best in FIGURE 1 A ,a gripping ear 114 is provided on outer portion 95 and gripping ear 115 extends extends through slot 116 so that ear 115 is connected with inner portion 94 of the beam. As the ears are moved toward one another, as indicated in FIGURE 11, this causes the outer portion 95 to be retracted and pulls outer end 96 out of engagement with connector 163 of tip 97. The driving mechanism for embodiment 88 is the same as shown in connection with the disposable unit of FIGURES 2 through 7 i.e., pinion gear 76 meshes with teeth 96 of beam 91 to control longitudinal movement of the beam from the piston retracted position to the piston extended position, which movement of tlle piston effects medicament delivery from the syringe . As indicated in FIGURE 8, a cover 117 is provided for covering the pinion gears 76 and guide pins 77. bile not specifically shown in FIGURE 8, beam 91 preferably also has distinguishable strips 70 thereon with strip sensor 78 alsg being within cover 117. A layout schematic of the syringe drive device no.l disposable or disposable is shown in FIGURE 12. As shown, a syringe pack 12tri is provided although each syringe may, if desired, be individually provided , with each syringe containing the predetermined amount of the desired medicament to be dispensed. Pack 120 or the individual syringes is placed in the dispensing rack i.e., the syringes are received in indentations 74 in the top of the base portion of the drive unit so that the drive nodules 121 i.e., the pinion gears and associated gearing to the stepper motor drive the piston of each syringe to deliver medicament as needed. The indicators visible at the top of the unit size a visual indication of the amount of medicament delivered at any time from any syringe. As also indicated in FIGURE 12, the device is battery powered, by means of batteries 122, and preferably includes indicators LE Ds 124 to indicate satisfactory battery cliarge. As also indicated, the syringe drive unit of this invention is controlled by pre progranuied memory unit 126, which unit is preferably a programmable non volatile logic device, such as a PROM device. It is necessary that unit 126 be inserted into the device for operation of the device.The pre prosrammed memory unit is externally programmed to establish the time and amount of medicament to be delivered by each syringe and controls the operation of the drive unit so that the exact amount is independently delivered from each syringe at the exact required time. In addition, a history 128 of medicament delivery is nade and stored for use in prescribing further medicament delivery, a beeper 13D is provided for alerting purposes, and rc ote demand option 132 can also be provided to allow a patient to control medicament delivery when, and to the extent, allowed by the pre programmed memory unit 126. As indicated by the schematic of FIGURE 13, a state machine 134 controls operation of stepper motor 82 through motor drive 136. A state machine is a loyic network whose output state is determined by thc present state of its input and the state of data currently being read from memory. A conibinational logic could be utilized in lieu of a state machine. While a microprocessor could also be utilized in lieu of a state machine, it is not preferred due to safety factors. While only one stepper motor is illustrated in FIGURE 13, it is to be realized that a separate stepper motor is provided for eacli rack 3D utilized. State machine 134 provides a pulse output through motor driver 136 to each stepper niotor so that the drive is thus accomplished as a pulse device rather than as a DC device . Each pulse causes the stepper motor to advance by increments, which motion is imparted through the associated gearing within gear box 84 to pinion gear 76. As indicated in FIGURE 13, a mechanical ratchet 138 is provided between stepper motor 82 and the gearing within gear box 84 to assure one way drive.Rotation of pinion gear 76 causes longitudinal movement of beam 63 or beam 91 if a non disposable unit to thus move the syringe piston a precise distance to thereby deliver the exact amount of medicament prescribed. A stepper motor is utilized in this invention for reasons of safety in the case of an accidental conductive path forming between the power supply of the device and the motor, which with DC motors causes uncontrolled motion. A stepper motor, on the other hand, requires clearly defined pulses in order to operate.Stepper motors were not heretofore utilized for battery operated devices, however, since one disadvantage of such motors ws high power consunlption g By this invention, the safety benefits of the stepper motor have been achieved by utilization of power efficient means for driving the stepper motor which has allowed use ot the stepper motor without requiring high power consumption and thus llas permitted use of the stepper motor with a battery operated device. lle power efficient means for operating the stepper motor is il ustrated by the pulse timing illustrations of FIGURE 16. The pulse timing illustrated in FIGURES 16 A and 1G B are manufacturer drive pulse recommendations FIGURE 16 A , and pulses as utilized in connection with a stepper motor as reported in NASA Technical Briefs, Volume 8, Ko. 4, HES 25119, Summer 1964 FIGURE 16 B . The conventional step drive shown in FIGURE 16 A is powered on between steps and energy efficiency is low, while the drive is partially powered on between steps in the drive shown inFIGURE l6 D with energy efficiency being moderate. FIGURE 16 C illustrates pulses in a ballistic drive utilizable in conjunction with a unidirectional rachet presenting known inertia mounted on the motor shaft and including a pawl for establishing the direction of rotation.FIGURE 16 D illustrates drive pulses that consume less energy than those previously shown in FIGURE 16 and which embody a dynamic braking effect. FIGURE 16 E illustrates drive pulses allowing precise design of energy consumption and force development by the motor by means of duty cycle progranmiing of the pulses. All of the drive pulses shown inFIGURES 16 C, D, and E can be utilized in this invention, to provide high energy efficiency, with the drive pulses as shown in FIGURE 16 E being now preferred. The pulse parameters are chosen in view of the desired inertia presented to the motor and in view of the maximum force to be allowed for any particular application. As also indicated in FIGURE 13, an internal memory check is provided by memory check unit 14 , and a clock check is provided by clock check unit 142, which unit may be connected to clocks 144 and 146. In addition, batteries 148 and 149 are connected to power the device through a diode type network 1SU, and a mini battery 151 is provided for back up. A control strip 153 is also provided or connection with the state machine. Strip sensor 78 is positioned adjacent to side 71 of beam 63 to sense positioning of strips 7 thereon. As indicated in FIGURE 13, the output of sensor 78 is provided to state machine 122. In addition, rotation of the gearing within the gear box 84 which gearing is connected with pinion gear 76 to cause movement of the rack and syringe piston is sensed by rotation sensor 154 which sensing can be accomplished for example, by placing holes in an associated gear 155 and providing a light generator at one siae and a sensor 154 at the opposite side . The output from sensor 154 is also provided to state machine 122. By thus sensing longitudinal movement of the beam and gear rotation, positioning control is enhanced and verified. An alternate embodiment 158 is shown in i IGURE 14 for driving the syringe piston . As shown, a hinged rack 160 is provided to apply drive to the piston 47. To acconiplish this type of drive, a plurality of rack sections 162 are provided each of which is connected with its adjacent section through a hinge pin 164. One end 166 of the thus formed hinge assembly is connected with the piston 47, anuthe teeth 168 on each section 162 are sequentially brought into engageflient with gear 17D, which gear is in engagement with worrzl gear 172 rotated by stepper motor 82. In addition, while an external plug 174 is indicated, internal battery operation can be utilized in the same manner as described herein above with respect to the other enbodiments described herein. Operation is essentially tlic same as with the previously described embodiments, except that the driving mechanism can be adjacent to the syringe and less longitudinal space is required due to hinging of the rack. Another drive embodiment 178 is shown in FIGURE 15. As indicated, precise rotation of shaft 18D is provided by a one way clockwise as indicated roller device unit lib2. Zn this enbodiment, rotation of the shaft is accomplished using bills 184 engaging the shaft. Each ball 184 is within a cllannol 186 having a slot 188 therein. Slot 188 is a longitudinally extending slot that is sufficiently wide to allow tlle ball to partly protrude there through so that the ball engages the shaft.In addition, each ball 184 is biased toward the end of the channel by a spring l90. Clockwise rotation of the shift is permitted since the ball is being rotated by such movement in a direction away fro the restraining wall of the channel. Counterclockwise rotation of the shaft is precluded, however, since attempted rotation of the shaft in this direction forces the ball into the restraining wall of the channel. Through use of this type of drive, rotation of shaft 180 controls movement of the syringe piston and no ratchet mechanism is required. In operation of the disposable device of this invention, the disposable unit, with a predetermined amount of medicament in each syringe to be utilized, is loaded into the drive device while the lid of the casing is in an open position, by positioning the syringes in the syringe indentations at the top of the base portion as the mounting bracket is snapped into place at the front of the base portion. lNlen so loaded, the teeth on the rack are brought into engagement with the pinion. The casing lid is then closed and locked by the mounting bracket snapping into the lid of the casing at closing.After insertion of a preprogrammed memory unit into the casing through a closeable aperture not shown in the bottom of the casing , the unit is ready for use in dispensing medicam.ent to a patient. ln use, czech syringe is connected with the patient in conventional fashion and medicament is thereafter delivered to the patient under the control of the pre programmed memory unit. . then the medicament in the syringe or syringes is depleted1 the disposable unit is removed from tfic drive device and discarded. If needed, a new unit can then be placed in the drive device for continued operation. Such a new unit can contain the same or different nedicaments as ceter ,ined to be needed by the patient s history. The non disposable unit operates in essentially the same manner as does the disposable unit, except that only the syringes and pistons are introduced into the unit ither individually or as a pack with each syringe being positioned on tulle base unit and each piston being then connected with a separate rack. After use, each piston is disconnected from the rack,and the syringe then taken from the base unit and discarded. As can be appreciated from the foregoing, this invention provides an improved device and method for controlling delivery of fluid from syringes.
