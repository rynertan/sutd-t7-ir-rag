# Pipe handling apparatus.

## Abstract
A pipe handling apparatus is adapted for transferring oil well pipe to and from a drilling rig. The apparatus includes a transportable chassis 3 having tracks 10, 12 for supporting and guiding a reciprocable and rotatable table 13 . A first scissors lift 17 mounted to the table provides vertical motion to a platform 15 on which is mounted a second scissors lift 21 . The second scissors lift 21 is designed to impart vertical and horizontal motion to a conveyor 19 . The conveyor 19 comprises three axially spaced endless belts for moving the pipe longitudinally to the conveyor takeoff point 31 . Tapered spades 117 protrude into the spaces during the pipe return operation to eject the pipe from the conveyor 19 . The conveyor 19 and platform 15 are reciprocable with respect to the second and first scissors lifts, respectively. The chassis 3 includes pivotable arms 8 for raising a pipe to the top of the collapsed scissors lifts so that a pipe rolls onto the conveyor belts prior to lifting.
