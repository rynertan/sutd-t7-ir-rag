# Method of storing radiation image data.

## Abstract
A stimulable phosphor sheet 3 carrying a radiation image stored therein is scanned with stimulating rays 4 , and the light emitted 3a from the stimulable phosphor sheet in proportion to the radiation energy stored therein is detected and converted into an electric signal 5 . The electric signal is converted to a digital signal 5 . On the basis of the digital signal, there are created digital data in an amount necessary for reproducing the radiation image for use in diagnosis, and digital data for storage 12 obtained by reducing the amount of information to a fraction of the amount of the digital data for diagnosis. The two kinds of digital data are recorded in separate recording media 10, 12 .
