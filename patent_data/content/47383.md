# Multitrack magnetic head and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A multipletrack magnetic head 38 has a closure section 26 comprising a ceramic substrate 30 to one surface of which are bonded equal width, closely spaced ferrite blocks 28 . The blocks are bonded together and to the substrate by glass 33 . A ferrite wafer 32 is bonded to the side of the closure section by cement 34 to form transducing gaps for a multiplicity of spaced magnetic head elements. Closure sections for such heads are cut from an as sembly comprising a ceramic substrate to which are bonded two interdigitated ferrite pieces with alternating comple mentary slots and fingers, the fingers of one piece being in the slots of the other piece. The ferrite pieces are bonded together and to the substrate by glass bonding. Each closure section is joined to a ferrite wafer, so that the wafer and closure section define a transducing gap there between.
