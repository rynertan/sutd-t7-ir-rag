## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus for assembling internal dividers for a carton and it also relates to apparatus for forming the carton with the assembled internal dividers.One problem with cartons which have internal dividers, for example, egg cartons or bottle cartons is the difficulty of assembling the internal dividers into the carton. One particular method and apparatus used involves assembling the carton at the packaging line and using the product in the carton as a jig on which to assemble the dividers. In this method the carton is first erected and the product, for example, spirit bottles are placed in the carton. Longitudinal dividers are then positioned between the bottles. Apparatus positioned above the carton shoots transverse dividers into position also between the bottles. This last step of the method relies on the bottles guiding the transverse dividers so that co operating slots in the longitudinal and transverse dividers engage each other.Needless to say, this apparatus is relatively inaccurate and is prone to failure with a consequent high wastage of packaging material and lost time on the packaging line. Other known apparatus of assembling such cartons suffer from substantially similar problems.The present invention is directed to overcome the problems of assembling carton internal dividers. It overcomes the problems by virtue of the fact that the apparatus comprises a longitudinal path to accommodate a longitudinal divider, the longitudinal path having an upstream end and a downstream end, a transverse path to accommodate a transverse divider, the transverse path passing transversely across the longitudinal path, alignment means in the transverse path to align the transverse divider with the longitudinal divider so that corresponding engagement slots in the dividers align, and means for moving the longitudinal divider in a downstream direction along the longitudinal path so that the engagement slots of the dividers interengage.The advantages of the invention are many, but in particular, internal dividers for cartons can be readily easily assembled with tonsiderable speed automatically. Furthermore, because the dividers are accurately aligned, the interengaging slots in the dividers accurately engage. This substantially eliminates waste of the dividers which is a feature of heretofore known apparatus as well as eliminating down time on a packaging line.Preferably, means to move a transverse divider into the transverse path is provided.The advantage of this feature of the invetion is that it leads to increased efficiency of the apparatus.In one embodiment of the invention the longitudinal path is of Ushaped cross section to accommodate a pair of longitudinal dividers joined by a connecting web formed from a longitudinal divider blank, the longitudinal path being formed along three adjacent side faces of an elongated former portion of the transverse path being formed by a transverse guide slot in the former extending between two opposing side faces of the former and in an upstream direction from the downstream end of the former.The advantage of this feature of the invention is that the apparatus accommod es a U shaped longitudinal divider blank which forms two longitudinal di ders. It has the further advantage that because the longitudinal dividers are connected by a connecting web, the assembled dividers can then readily easily be fixed to the carton by means of the connecting web. In another embodiment of the invention the transverse path on each side of the former is provided by spaced apart parallel plates to retain the transverse divider therebetween, the alignment means being a stop member spaced apart from the former to engage the leading end of a transverse divider when in position in the former.The advantage of this feature of the invention is that it provides positive location of a transverse divider in the transverse path.Preferably, movable stop means is provided on the downstream side of the transverse path to abutt a side edge of the transverse divider to prevent movement of the transverse divider in a downstream direction during interengagement of the engagement slots of the dividers, the stop means being movable to permit the assembled dividers to pass downstream.The advantage of this feature of the invention is that it provides positive location of a transverse divider while it is being assembled with a longitudinal divider.Advantageously, the stop means is provided by a pair of stc blocks one on each of a pair of slidable bars disposed on each side of the former and spaced apart therefrom to provide clearance for the assembled dividers, each bar being transverse of the longitudinal path and parallel to a side face of the former and slidable axially to move the stop blocks to clear the transverse divider.The advantage of this feature of the invention is that it provides a relatively simple, and generally maintenance and trouble free stop means as well as leading to ease of construction of the apparatus.In a further embodiment of the invention the former is adapted to form the pair of longitudinal dividers joined by the connecting web from the divider blank, the lower face of the former being adapted to receive the connecting web, and foldina means are provided to fold the longitudinal dividers towards each other to abutt the side faces of the former, said means being provided on each side of the former and spaced apart therefrom.The advantage of this feature of the invention is that it permits a longitudinal divider blank comprising a pair of longitudinal dividers joined through fold lines by a connecting web to be formed prior to assembly of the divider blanks. It will be appreciated that this leads to further improved efficiency and economy of use of the apparatus.Preferably the means for moving the longitudinal dividers along the longitudinal path comprises means for moving the longitudinal dividers along the upstream portion of the longitudinal path and means for moving the longitudinal dividers along the downstream portion of the longitudinal path, the means for moving the longitucinal dividers along the upstream portion comprising a pair of spaced apart conveying belts adjacent the lower face of the former to engage and clamp the connecting web of the longitudinal divider blank therebetween, and the means for moving the longitudinal dividers along the downstream port ion comprising pairs of spaced apart conveying chains mounted adjacent each side of the former, the chains being movable in registration parallel to the former and having conveying dogs thereon to engage and receive the longitudinal dividers from the conveying belts.The advantage of this feature of the invention is that it leads to a relatively efficient and smooth running appa ratus and it also leads to positive registration between the longitudinal and transverse dividers. Additionally, it leads to ease of construction of the apparatus.Advantageously, three transverse paths are provided.The advantage of this feature of the invention is that it permits three transverse dividers to be assembled with the longitudinal divider. In particular, when the three transverse paths are incorporated in apparatus in which the longitudinal path is of a U shape to accommodate a pair of longitudinal dividers, it provides for the assembly of internal dividers which divide a carton into twelve compartments. This is particularly advantageous for use in egg cartons, spirit bottle cartons, and the like.Additionally, the invention overcomes the problem of forming a carton with internal dividers. It overcomes this problem in that the invention provides apparatus which incorporates the apparatus for assembling the internal dividers, as well as comprising a carton blank path for the carton blank extending longitudinally of the longitudinal path and in a plane parallel to the lower web of the U shaped path,means to move a carton blank along the carton blank path in registration with the assembled internal dividers, and means for fixing the assembled internal dividers to the carton blank by fixing the connecting web to the carton blank,and means for forming the carton blank.The advantages of this feature of the invention is that it permits assembled internal dividers to be fixed to a carton blank and the carton blank to be subsequently formed. This, it will be appreciated provides a carton ready for accepting product.Preferably, the lower portion of the former extends downstream of the transverse path and is pivotal to the former about a transverse axis.The advantages of this feature of the invention is that it ensures a good bond between the connecting web of the longitudinal divider and the carton blank. It also provides a relatively simple construction for achieving this cbject.Preferably, the means for moving the carton blank along the carton blank path in registration with the assembled interval dividers is provided by a pair of spaced apart main conveying chains extending substantially the length of the apparatus beneath the former, the main conveying chains moving in registration with the longitudinal divider conveying chains and having dogs to engage the carton blanks to convey carton blanks through the apparatus.The advantages of this feature of the invention is that it ensures positive registration between the carton blank and the assembled internal dividers. In another embodiment of the invention the apparatus includes means for forming the carton blank is downstream of the fixing means.The advantage of this feature of the invention is that it permits a formed carton to be delivered from the apparatus, which leads to considerable efficiency on packaging lines. In a still further embodiment of the invention means for collapsing a formed carton are provided downstream of the forming means.The advantage of this feature of the invention is that I permitting the carton blank to be collapsed so that carton blanks ready for packaging and transportation to a packaging line are delivered from the machine.The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description of an embodiment thereof given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an elevational view of apparatus according to the invention with some details omitted for clarity, Fig. 2 is a plan view of the apparatus of Fig. 1 also certain details being omitted for clarity.

The carton 2 in the collapsed form is illustrated in Fig. 19 of the drawings. The internal dividers divide the carton 2 into twelve compartments 3 as can most clearly be seen inFig. 13. The apparatus 1 also includes apparatus also according to the invention, and indicated generally by the reference numeral 38 for assembling the internal dividers. Before describing the apparatus 1 in detail the carton 2 will be described with reference to Figs. 13 to 19.Each carton 2 comprises a carton blank 10 of cardboard material see Fig. 13 having portions 11 defining side walls. Fold lines 12 about which the portions 11 are bent are provided. Flaps 13 to form a top and bottom of the carton 2 are joined to the portions 11 by fold lines 14. A tab 15 is provided at the free end of one side wall 11 for fixing to the other free end 16 of a side wall 11.A longitudinal divider blank 17 also of cardboard seeFig. 15 forming two longitudinal dividers 18 joined through fold lines 18 by a connecting web 20 is provided for mounting inside the carton 2. The divider blank 17 is fixed to one of the side walls 11 by the connecting web 20 as can most clearly be seen in Fig. 13. Three transverse dividers 21 of cardboard see Fig. 16 are provided to engage the longitudinal dividers 18 and to form the compartments 3 of the carton 2. Co operating engagement slots 22 in the longitudinal and transverse dividers are interengageable with each other.The apparatus 1 comprises a main lower framework 30 with upwardly projecting support members 31. Transverse members 34 bridging the support members 31 support a main overhead support beam 35. The apparatus 38 for assembling the internal dividers is mounted between the lower main framework 30 and the overhead support beam 35. The apparatus 38 comprises an elongated former 40 having an upstream portion 46 and a downstream portion 47 which extends between the two extreme transverse members 34 and is suspended as we described in detail below from the support beam 35. The former 40 is a compound member also described in detail below and forms a U shaped longitudinal path 41 to accommodate longitudinal divider blanks 17. The path 41 is formed along side faces 44 and a lower face 45 of the former 40.Figs. 6 to 9 illustrate sections through the former 40 at various points along its length showing the passage of divider blanks 17 and 21 along the longitudinal path 41. The upstream portion 46 of the former 40 is of hollow rectangular section, see Fig. 6, the sides and lower end forming the side faces 44 and the lower face 45 respectively.A hopper 50 for storing flat longitudinal divider blanks 17 is mounted on the framework 30. Divider blanks 17 are delivered from the bottom of the hopper 50 by suction pads not shown onto a pair of spaced apart secondary conveying chains 53. One chain 53 of the pair is illustrated in Fig. 5. The chains 53 are supported and driven on sprockets 51. The sprockets 51 are mounted on shafts 57 mounted on the main framework 30 by brackets not shown .Dogs 52 on the chains 53 maintain the blanks 17 in registration.A blank 17 is illustrated passing along the chains 53 in Fig. 5.Means for moving the divider blanks 17 along the upstream portion 46 of the former 40 is provided by a pair of conveying belts 54 and 55 which engage the connecting web 20 of the divider blanks 17 on delivery from the chains 53. This can most clearly be seen in Fig.5. The belts 54 and 55 are driven and supported on rollers 58 and 59 respectively, the rollers 58 are rotatably supported on the main framework 30 by brackets not shown while the rollers 59 are supported also on bearing means not shown in the former 40. A portion of the lower end 45 is removed to accommodate the belt 55. Conventional drive mcans are provided to drive the belts 54 and 55. Folding means to fold the longitudinal dividers 18 upwardly about the fold lines 19 towards the side faces 44 of the upstream portion 46 of the former 40 are provided by forming bars 60 which are suspended on supports not shown extending from the overhead support beam 35. The forming bars 60 are illustrated in Figs.1, 2 and 6 and extend upwardly in a downstream direction towards the former 40 from a position spaced apart from the former 40. The belts 54 and 55 move the longitudinal divider blanks 17 along the former 40 past the forming bars 60 thereby forming the dividers 18Means to move the longitudinal dividers 18 along the longitudinal path 41 formed by the downstream portion 47 of the former 40 are provided by pairs of conveying chains 62 on each side of the former 40. This can most clearly be seen in Figs. 1, 2 and 5. The conveying chains 62 are supported and driven on sprockets 63 which are mounted on spindels 64 rotatably mounted on brackets 65.The brackets 65 are mounted on the overhead support beam 35. Dogs 66 on the conveying chains 62 are provided to positively engage on each longitudinal divider 18. The chains 62 are driven in registration with the belts 54 and 55 by conventional drive means, which will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.The downstream end of the former 40 is formed by a cranked member 70, attached to the support beam 35 at 69, seeFig. 3. The lower end of the cranked member 70 forms the lower face 45 for receiving the connecting web 20 of longitudinal divider blank 17. Three intermediate longitudinal members 71 are supported on threaded members 72 and retained in position on the threaded members 72 by lock nuts 73.Referring to Fig. 7 plate members 80 connected to the intermediate bar 71 by adjusting brackets 81 form side faces 44 of the former 40. A plate member 82 connected to the intermediate bar 71 by an adjusting bracket 84 forms the lower face 45. A support plate 83 extends beneath the lower face 45 of the former 40 to retain the connecting web 20 of the longitudinal divider blank 17 adjacent the lower face 45.Three transverse paths 88, see Figs. 1, 3 and 7 to acccmmodate the transverse dividers 21 cross the longitudinal path 41 at 89. The transverse paths are provided by transverse guide slots 90 which are formed in the former 40 by plates 91 mounted on the intermediate bars 71 by adjusting brackets 92. The slots 90 extend between the ide faces 44 and also extend from the downstream end of the former 40 to permit the transverse members 21 to exit from the former 40 in the downstream direction.The relative vertical positioning of the slots 90 may be varied to accommodate different spacings of transverse dividers 21 by adjusting the position of the intermediate bars 71 on the members 72 and compensating for the movement by adjusting the relative position of the plates 91 by means of the adjusting brackets 92. Similarly the relative positions of the plate members 80 may be adjusted by means of the adjusting brackets 81 to accommodate different spacing of the lon gitudinal dividers 18.Each transverse path 88 is formed on each side of the former 40 by pairs of plates 93. The plates 93 and the plates cl forming the slots 90 all have tapered leadins 94, to facilitate entry of the transverse dividers 21. Brackets not shown suspended from the support beam 35 support the plates 93. Adjustment not shown is also provided to permit the positioning of the plates 93 to be varied. Alignment means to align each transverse divider with a longitudinal divider is provided by a stop member 98 in the transverse path 88. The stop members 98 are so positioned to stop the dividers 21 in alignment with the longitudinal dividers 18.The transverse dividers are delivered from three hoppers 99 by means of suction pads not shown onto pairs of spaced apart transverse conveying chains 101 which form means to move the dividers 21 onto the transverse path 88. One chain 101 of each pair is illustrated in Fig. 7.Dogs 100 on each chain 101 engage the dividers 21. The chains 101 are supported on sprockets 102 and driven in registration with the conveying chains 62 to ensure that the dividers 21 are in registration with the dividers 18.The sprockets 102 are on shafts 103 which are driven by conventional drive means. Brackets not shown rotatably support the shafts 103 on the main framework 30.A movable stop means is provided adjacent to the downstream side of each transverse path 88 to prevent the transverse dividers moving while the co operating slots 22 of both the transverse dividers and the longitudinal dividers are engaging. The stop means is provided by stop blocks 105 mounted on slidable bars 106 on each side of the former 40, see Figs. 1, 11 and 12. The bars 106 are slidable in brackets 107 mounted by means not shown on the framework 30. Pneumatic rams not shown slide the bars 106 vertically in the brackets 107 to move the stop blocks 105 downwardly to clear the transverse paths 88, to permit movement of the assembled dividers downstream out of the former 44. The stop blocks 105 are shown in the downward position on the left hand side of Fig. 12, leaving the transverse path clear.The carton blanks 10 are stored in a hopper 110 and are delivered from the base of the hopper 110 by mechanically operated pushers 111 to engage nip rollers 112, seeFigs. 1 and 2. The pushers are mounted in the base of the hopper 110. Means to move the carton blank along a longitudinal carton blank path 114 through the apparatus 1 are provided by a pair of spaced apart main conveying chains 115 extending substantially the length of the apparatus 1 and driven and supported on sprockets 116.The sprockets 116 are nounted on shafts not shown rotatably supported in the main framework 30. Dogs 117 are provided on the chains 115 to engage and remove the carton blanks from the nip roller 112. Conventional drive means drive the chains 115 in registration with the conveying chains 62 so that the carton blanks 10 and assembled dividers 18, 21 are in registration.A support plate 120 extends along the lower length of the apparatus 1 to support the carton blank 10. This can clearly be seen in Fig. 3. The plate 120 and the main conveying chains 115 rise gradually in a downstream direction to bring the carton blank and assembled dividers together at 121. A means for fixing the assembled internal dividers and the carton blank is provided by a glue dispensing nozzle 122 between the support plate 120 and the former 40 to dispense glue onto the carton blank 10 as it passes beneath the nozzle 122.A lower downstream portion 126 of the former 40 is pivotally connected to the remainder of the former 40 about a transverse pivot pin 127. The pivotal portion 126 of the former bears on the connecting web 20 and clamps the connecting web 20 and the carton blank 10 together against the support plate 120. This provides adequate pressure to ensure a good bond is formed by the glue.Needless to say, a 1 though a glue dispensing nozzle has been described any other suitable fixing means could be used, for example, a stapling device could have been used to fix the assembled dividers to the carton blank.Rollers 129 are provided adjacent to the free end of the pivotal portion 126 to facilitate smooth passage of the connecting web 20 and carton blank beneath the pivotal portion 126. The rollers are clearly illustrated inFig. 3.After glueing, the assembled dividers 18 and 21 disengage the former 40 altogether and the carton blank is conveyed by the main conveying chains 115 beneath a shaping bar 135 which bends the dividers over into the position illustrated in Fig. 17. Guide bars 136 extending downstream of the former hold the carton blank 10 down against the support plate 120. Means to form the carton blank 10 into a carton is provided shaping bars 138 which bring the outer side walls 11 together and a glueing nozzle or stapling device neither of which are shown secures the tab 15 to the end 16 of the side wall 11 as illustrated in Fig. 18 The shaping bars 138 are supported on mounting memb ers 139 which project from the main framework 30, this is clearly illustrated inFigs. 1 and 2.Such carton forming devices and securing means are well known in the art and it is not intended to describe them in further detail.Two further shaping bars 140 project downstream of the apparatus from the support bracket 139 to collapse the formed carton as shown in Fig. 19 for ease of transportation. An output conveyor 145 removes the collapsed cartons for subsequent packaging.In use, the longitudinal and tra nsverse dividers 17 and 21 and the carton blanks 10 are dispensed in registration respectively from the hoppers 50, 99 and 110. The longitudinal divider blank 17 are conveyed between the conveyor belts 54 and 55 and are formed into longitudinal dividers 18 about the former 40. The transverse dividers are also delivered in registration into the transverse paths 88 and are retained and aligned for assembly with the longitudinal dividers 18 by the stop members 98. The longitudinal dividers 18 are conveyed through the downstream portion of the former by the conveying chains 62. The transverse dividers are retained in position during assembly by the stop blocks 105. Once the co operating slots 22 of the dividers 18 and 21 interengage the stop blocks move downwardly to permit the assembled dividers to proceed through the longitudinal path 41. The assembled dividers and the carton blanks move in registration and a metered quantity of glue is dispensed onto the carton blank by the glue dispensing nozzle 122. The carton blank and dividers are brought together by means of the clamping action between the pivotal portion 126 former and the support plate 120 thereby ensuring a good bond between the connecting web 20 and the carton blank 10.The shaping bar 135 collapses the dividers as the carton blank moves beneath the shaping bar 135. Simultaneously, the shaping bars 138 form the carton and the tab 50 is secured to the end 16 of an outer wall 11 of the carton blank. The shaping bars 140 then collapse the formed carton and the output conveyor 145 delivers the collapsed carton for packaging.It will be appreciated that when the apparatus is required to assemble cartons of different size and compartment size, this can easily be done by adjusting the relative position of the intermediate bars 71, seeFig. 3, as already described. Corresponding adjustments will have to be made to the plates 80 and 91 and the plates 93 as already described. In order to accommodate all these adjustments various other corresponding necessary vertical and transverse adjustments have been built into the main components of the apparatus as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.Needless to say, it will be appreciated that if it were desired to produce formed cartons in the erected form from the apparatus just described, the shaping bars 140 would be removed and replaced by suitable shaping bars to fully erect the carton as well as the internal dividers within the carton. Such devices are well known in the art It will also be appreciated that when it is desired to erect the collapsed carton manually all that is required is to move the diagonally opposing corners in the direction of the arrows D as illustrated in Fig. 19.This operation can simply and easily be achieved manually.Although, the apparatus has been described as having one former extending centrally through the apparatus, it will be appreciated that in fact two or more formers could have been used. In which case, the formers could be spaced apart and parallel to each other. Needless to say, it will be appreciated that apparatus having two former would provide a carton with five compartments across. Also, it is envisaged that each former may have more or less than three guide slots for positioning the transverse dividers. In fact, it will be appreciated that if desired the apparatus need only have a longitudinal path to accommodate a single longitudinal divider and a single transverse path to accommodate one transverse divider.Although the apparatus has been described with the longitudinal path formed by a former, the longitudinal path could be formed by any suitable means, for example, a pair of spaced apart plates could be provided between which the divider would move along, or alternatively, a plurality of parallel spaced apart bars to retain the divider therebetween could be provided. Indeed, it is also envisaged that the transverse path could similarly be formed by other means.It is envisaged that by suitably shaping the side faces of the former, the dividers could be assembled to form compartments of cross section other than square or rectangular cross section, for example, triangle or other polygonal cross sections.It will also be appreciated that although the movable stop means has been described as being provided by stop blocks mounted on slidable bars, any other suitable movable stop means could have been provided, for example, transverse gates with suitably positioned slots to align with the transverse dividers could have been provided.Indeed, it is envisaged that in certain cases, instead of the stop means being provided by a positive stop, it could be provided by a means which would offer resistance to the passage of the transverse dividers. In other words, while the co operating slots of the dividers were interengaging, the force exerted by the transverse dividers on the resistance means would not be sufficient to overcome the resistance, however, once the cooperating slots had engaged, the force exerted by the transverse divider on the resistance mean s would overcome the resistance to motion and the assembled dividers would then move on.It will also be appreciated that means to move the dividers and carton blank through the apparatus other than chains in conveying belts could have been provided.In fact, it is envisaged that in less sophisticated apparatus the dividers and indeed the carton blanks could if desired be moved manually through the apparatus.Needless to say, it will be appreciated that although the apparatus for assembling the dividers has been described as being incorporated in apparatus for forming a carton, this is not necessary and the apparatus for assembling the dividers could be provided on its own without departing from the scope of the invention. It is also envisaged that instead of assembling dividers for bottle cartons, the apparatus could be used for assembling dividers for any type of cartons, for example, egg carton. Needless to say, it is envisaged that the apparatus could be used for assembling cartons other than cardboard cartons, for example, cartons of a plastics material or the like.It is also envisaged that instead of driving the belts 55 and 55, chains 53, 62, and 101 in registration with the main conveying chain 115, a means could be provided on the apparatus to align the assembled dividers with a carton blank prior to glueing, from which point the assembled dividers and the carton blanks could then be moved in registration.
