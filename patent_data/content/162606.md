# Aromatic polythioetheramides and process for their production.

## Abstract
Aromatic polythioetheramides have repeating units rep resented by one or both of the following formulae Repeating units derived from C₆ C₃₀ aromatic diamines may replace up to 50 mol of the above thioetheramide units, and from 51 to 99 mol when Ar is isophthalyl or terephthalyl. The polymers have excellent moldability, flame retardance, heat resistance and chemical resistance, and are suitable for use as engineering plastics.
