## Description
Making shaDed sintered inorganic bodiesThis invention relates to a method of making an inorganic sintered shaped body, by mixing a sinterable inorganic powder and a moldable binder, shaping the mixture by injection molding or extrusion, and heating the mixture to decompose the binder and sinter the powder.In such a method, the binder has hitherto been selected from the viewpoint of making a mixture which is easily flowable for molding large amounts of binder, in relation to the inorganic powder, tend to be used because of the limited discharge capacity of the extrusion or injection molding machines, to ensure flowability of powder from the standpoint of the bulk density of the molded article and sintering. However, improvement is desirable in the high density of the molded article which affects the physical properties of the products, and in ease of binder removal during the sintering.Molded articles obtained by extrusion or injection molding have an advantage that the inorganic power is more homogeneously. packed therein than in those obtained by press molding, and therefore, sintered bodies of a uniform particle size are very easy to produce. In press molding, however, molded articles having a powder packing density of 60 based on the theoretical density are obtained relatively easily because the amount of binder used is generally as small as 5 by weight by contrast, in extrusion and injection moldings, a binder in amount as large as 30 by weight is sometimes used, so that only molded articles having a powder packing density of 40 are obtained. Such molded articles are defective in that bodies obtained by sintering are low in density as compared with those obtained from press molding.Although extrusion and injection moldings are superior in productivity to press molding and slip casting, it was difficult, because of the difficulty in obtaining high density sintered bodies, to apply them to the production of functional ceramics such as translucent ceramics, magnetic ceramics, dielectric ceramics or high strength ceramics of which the function is exhibited only in the form of a sintered body having a density near to the theoretical.With molded articles obtained by extrusion or injection molding in which the powder packing density is low, because of their large shrinkage rate on sintering, it is difficult to maintain the dimensional precision of the sintered body obtained. This becomes a problem particularly with ceramics which are difficult to process after sintering.In order to improve the foregoing problems encountered in the extrusion or injection molding of inorganic powders, various kinds of binder have been used, including water soluble and synthetic ones, but none of these, because of their defects described below, allow the foregoing problems to be solved.Water soluble binders include starch, cellulose derivatives and polyvinyl alcohols, and are widely used. A smaller amount, as solid, of water soluble binder can be used than of synthetic resin binder. However, when water soluble binders are used in an aqueous solution, the amount of the solution is almost equal to that of a synthetic resin binder and requires 20 by weight based on the inorganic powder. As compared with the synthetic resin binders, the water soluble binder solution is low in viscosity so that it easily penetrates between and disperses the powder. However, due to its poor lubricating property, large quantities of water are necessary to give a required flowability.Further, when powder containing the water soluble binder is extrusion or injection molded, there is a problem, namely because the strength of a moldeti article is developed with the vaporization of solvent, the molded article immediately after molding has poor strength and easily changes shape. Accordingly, it is difficult to handle. For this reason, extrusion or injection molding is carried out so that molded articles having better strength can be obtained by decreasing the amount of water. But this method, since it is based on the sacrifice of the flowability of powder, causes problems such as increase in discharge pressure as well as abrasion of molding machines by inorganic powders and consequent staining of molded articles.Further, on removing water by drying the molded articles, cracks are easily generated therein owing to non uniform drying, and in order to avoid this, a long period of time is necessary for drying. This increases the cost of the extrusion or injection molding.As synthetic binders, polystyrene, polypropylene and polyethylene are used, but they have the following defects.These binders, because of their high melt viscosity, do not easily penetrate into the aggregates of inorganic powders, resulting in insufficient dispersion of powder. Further, they produce only molded articles which are low in powder packing density. Consequently, homogeneous and highdensity sintered bodies are not obtained therefrom.Synthetic resin binders, because they are used for molding in a molten state, produce molded articles of high strength by immediate cooling after molding. Because of this, powder flowability on molding can be improved by using a large amount of binder, unlike with the water soluble binders. With an increase in the amount, however, there is a problem that the molded article foams easily due to thermal decomposition gases generated from the binder on sintering. In order to avoid this foaming, a step called a defatting step, for removing the binder by thermal decomposition is applied however, this requires a longer period of time than drying of the water soluble binders, thereby resulting in a great reduction in productivity. There is also a method for producing molded articles of high strength by hardening synthetic resin binders other than the foregoing thermoplastic resins, for example thermosetting resins such as phenolic or urethane resins, on molding. But with these binders it may happen that, when the molding is interrupted, hardening takes place in the molding machines, making continuation of molding impossible.Thus, with all conventional binders for extrusion or injection molding, there are problems, such as the low rate of powder packing or long period of time for removal of binders. In addition, molded articles which are weak are produced depending upon the kind of binder and they contain impurities, or become heterogeneous due to increase in the required discharge capacity of molding machines and abrasion of the machines. Consequently, there is a need for improved binders to solve these problems.We have succeeded in obtaining molded articles free from these defects by using as binder oxygen containing wax components hereinafter referred to as oxygen containing wax type binders According to the invention, in the aforesaid type of method, there is used as binder a mixture containing an oxygen containing wax. The oxygen containing wax type binder used in the present invention, because of its low viscosity on melting and good compatibility with inorganic powders, easily penetrates into the gaps of aggregates of fine inorganic powders, and has a superior lubricating property. For this reason, this binder makes it possible to obtain molded articles having a homogeneous powder dispersion as well as a very high powder packing density which is not attained with conventional binders. Further, molded articles produced can harden easily and immediately after molding by cooling.Particularly, in extrusion molding in which the dimensional precision of molded articles is difficult to maintain, the binder in the present invention can markedly improve the dimensional precision as compared with the conventional ones. Of the conventional binders, thermoplastic synthetic resin binders are also capable of hardening molded articles by cooling however, these binders have a high melt viscosity and a poor flowability as compared with the binder of the present invention. In order to make up for these defects, an increased amount of a binder which is poorer in thermal conductivity than the inorganic powder must be used. This is not desirable because much time is taken for cooling the molded article and it easily changes shape during cooling.Further, when conventional watersoluble binders are used, the molded article is weak and not easy to handle until the water as solvent is vaporized away. Further, molded articles such as thin products and large sized ones sometimes change in shape by their own weight whereby maintenance of dimensional precision is even more difficult.The oxygen containing wax type binder in the present invention not only solves the problems of the conventional binders in extrusion or injection molding of inorganic powders, but also has a markedly superior property over conventional binders with respect to the removal of binder as described below.The binder in the present invention is composed of a number of waxes containing oxygen containing wax components.Therefore, the binder has no definite thermal decomposition point, its temperature range of thermal decomposition being considerably large. For this reason, when molded articles obtained with this binder are heated, thermal decomposition of the wax type binder does not occur suddenly at a certain temperature, but shows a slow progress with rlse in temperature, which is a characteristic not observed with conventional binders.Thus, when conventional synthetic resin binders are used, generation of foams or cracks in molded articles due to gases evolved from suddenly decomposing binders cannot be avoided unless the rate of temperature rise in the vicinity of the thermal decomposition temperature is no more than several degrees per hour, or even slower than this. Contrary to this, with the oxygen containing wax type binder of the present invention, it has become possible to remove the binder without doing any damage to the molded articles even by heating at a rate of temperature rise of several tens to 100 degrees per hour.Thus, the invention allows the speeding of the thermal decomposition of the binder. In producing the sintered body of inorganic powder by extrusion or injection molding using conventional binder, the longest period of time is required for the removal of the binder. Consequently, the oxygen containing wax type binder in the present invention allows great increase in productivity of the method.Generation of foams and cracks on molded articles was also observed with the conventional water soluble binders on removing water as a solvent from the molded articles unless the water was vaporized as slowly as with the synthetic resin binders which is costly and unproductive. Also,withwax type binders, their thermal decomposition in the course of heating is sudden when they consist mainly of a single compound, unlike in the binder of the present invention. Therefore, the effect observed with the oxygencontaining wax type binder of the present invention is not obtained.Thus, by using the oxygen containing wax type binder, it is possible to produce homogeneous, high packing density molded articles or inorganic powders which cannot be obtained by extrusion or injection molding using conventional binders, and therefore, great reduction in the sintering temperature also is possible.These effects brought by the oxygen containing wax type binder in the present invention are particularly displayed in the production of transluent ceramics, such as a translucent alumina sintered body requiring high temperature sintering. Accordingly, the present invention is very useful in allowing high quality articles to be aupplied at low cost.Examples of the oxygen containing wax type binder used in the present invention which are solid or semi solid at room temperature include 1 higher fatty acids and esters and glycerides of the higher fatty acid with a higher alcohol and 2 oxygen containing compounds obtained by air oxidation of normal paraffin or isoparaffin such as alcohols, ketones, carboxylic acid, oxycarboxylic acids, ketocarboxylic acids, esters or lactones.These oxygen containing wax type binders may be natural waxes and or synthetic waxes. The natural waxes include for example animal waxes such as bees wax, whale wax, China wax and wool wax, vegetable waxes such as candelilla wax, carnauba wax, Japan wax, Ouricury wax, sugar cane wax, and mineral waxes such as montan wax, ozokerite wax, ceresine and lignite wax. The synthetic waxes include for example modified waxes such as montan wax derivatives, paraffin wax derivatives and microcrystalline wax derivatives, higher monohydric alcohols such as cetyl alcohol, ceryl alcohol, melissyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol and lauryl alcohol, higher fatty acids such as capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid, fatty acid esters such as cetyl palmitate, melissyl palmitate and ceryl cerotate, and glycerides such as tri palmitin and tristearin.Hydrocarbon waxes which can be blended with these natural or synthetic oxygen containing waxes include petroleum waxes such as paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax or petrolatum, and synthetic hydrocarbons such as Fischer Tropsch wax and low molecular weight polyethylene.Of these waxes, oxygen containing waxes such as vegetable waxes, modified waxes or higher fatty acids, and mixtures of these oxygen containing waxes with petroleum waxes or synthetic hydrocarbon waxes are preferably used, as such or in compositions comprising mixtures thereof, from the standpoint of moldability. Particularly, in terms of moldability and thermal decomposability, the effect of the present invention can be displayed most effectively when carnauba wax, paraffin wax derivatives e.g. oxidized paraffin wax , microcrystalline wax derivatives e.g.oxidized microcrystalline wax , higher fatty acids e.g.stearic acid, isostearic acid, lauric acid and mixtures of these oxygen containing waxes with paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax, or low molecular weight polyethylene are used alone or in combination. Furthers of these combinations, compositions obtained by mixing paraffin wax, oxidized paraffin wax, microcystalline wax or oxidized microcrystalline wax and higher fatty acids e.g. stearic acid displacy the greatest effect. Of these oxygen containing waxes, oxidized waxes having an acid value of I to 80 mg KOH g prepared by oxidizing a linear hydrocarbon having an average of 17 to 40 carbon atoms per molecule or a branched hydrocarbon having an average of 30 to 150 carbon atoms particularly exhibit the effects of the present invention with respect to moldability and thermal decomposability.The content of the oxygen containing wax in the binder in the invention is preferably not less than 1 by weight in terms of thermal decomposability, and particularly good results are obtained when the content is not less than 5 by weight the content of the oxygen containing wax is most preferably not less than 10 by weight, in which case the greatest effect is displayed.The amount of the oxygen containing wax type binder used varies with the physical property of the inorganic powder to be molded. However, it is preferably in a range of 15 to 60 by volume based on the molded article comprising the binder and the inorganic powder. When the amount is below this range, flowability on molding is so insufficient that molding becomes difficult. When the amount exceeds this range, the ease of thermal decomposition of binder, which is a feature of the present invention is decreased. When the proportion of the binder in the molded article is 25 to 55 by volume, the wax type binder best displays its effect.Examples of the inorganic powder used in the present invention include powders of single metallic or non metallic elements and oxides or non oxides thereof which are usable for powder metallurgy or production of ceramics. Also, these powders may be composed of single elements, alloys or compounds, alone or in combination. Oxides and nonoxides may contain one or more metallic elements as well as cations and anions. Further, systems containing the oxides or non oxides and additives added to improve the characteristics thereof may also be applied in the present invention.Examples of specific metallic powders include aluminum ofGroup III of the Periodic Table the long form is referred to silicon of Group IV scandium, yttrium, lanthanoids and actinoides of Group IIIa titanium, zirconium, hafnium and thorium of Group IVa vanadium, niobium, tantalum and protactinium of Group Va chromium, molybdenum, tungsten and uranium of Group VIa manganese, technetium and rhenium of Group VIIa iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium and platinum of Group VIII copper, silver and gold of Group Ib zinc and cadmium of Group IIb thallium of Group IIIb germanium, tin and lead of Group IVb arsenic, antimony and bismuth orGroup Vb and tellurium and polonium of Group VIb.Specific examples of the oxide powders include oxides of the above referred to metals0 Oxides of metals other than those above mentioned include beryllium oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, strontium oxide, barium oxide, lanthanum oxide, gallium oxide, indium oxide and selenium oxide. Specific examples of oxides containing a plural number of metal elements, generally called double oxides, include the following which are classified with respect to crystal structure perovskite type oxides such as NaNbO3,SrZrO3, PbZrO3, SrTiO3, BaZrO3, PbTi03, AgTaO3, BaTiO3 orLaAlO3 spinel type oxides such as ggA1204, ZnA1204, CoAl2O4, NiAl2O4, NiCr2O4, FeCr2O4, MgFe2O4, Fe3O4 or ZnFe2O4 illmenite type oxides such as MgTiO3, MnTiO3, FeTiO3, CoTiO3, NiTiO3, ZnTiO3, LiNbO3 or LiTaO3 and garnet type oxides such as rare earth gallium garnet represented by Gd3Ga5012 and rare earth iron garnet represented by Y3Fe50n2. Examples of non oxide powders of metal include carbides, nitrides, borides and sulfides of the metals described above. Of these metal non oxides, particularly effective are carbides such as SiC, TiC, WC, TaC, XfC, ZrC and B4C nitrides such as Si3N4, AIN, BN and TiN and borides such as TiB2, ZrB2 andThe binder used in the present invention is useful independently of the particle size and shape of the powder. It is however most effective when used with powders of not more than 100 m average particle size.Also, as the powder becomes fine, the homogeneity of molded articles becomes important, so that the binder is particularly effective when used with powders of not more than 20 pin average particle size. Further, the binder exhibits its effect most when applied to powders of not more than 5 pin average particle size. The binder is effective when used with super fine powders of less than 0.01 pm average particle size however, it displays its effects better when applied to fine powders of not less than 0.01 pm average particle size.The inorganic powder is preferably an oxide powder, particularly a metal oxide powder for the production of translucent material, insulating materials, semi conductor materials, piezoelectric materials, magnetic materials or electro optical materials. Further, the present invention is particularly effective in producing translucent materials such as A1203, MgO, Y203 and MgA1204 formed into pipes as illumination tubes for a discharge lamp, andPb1 xLaxZr1 yZryO3 wherein x is 0 to 1.0 and y is 0 to 1.0 formed into various shapes.The method of the invention can be carried out using extrusion and injection molding machines for plastics or ceramics which can be heated to a temperature more than that at which the binder composition melts. Also, provided that the oxygen containing wax type binder retains its effect, the inorganic powder and the binder can be previously kneaded or granulated and then molded in the molding machine, or after blending, directly added to the machine and molded. The molded body is heated to carry out defattying and calcination. The calcined body is sintered by a usual method0The present invention will be illustrated in detail by the following examples and comparative examples. Unless otherwise stated, all percentages in the examples are by weight.Of the physical properties of sintered bodies, the density is a value, expressed in percent, of the ratio of the density of sintered body to the theoretical density of aluminum oxide. The light transmittance is a value, expressed in percent, of the ratio of the intensity of incident light when parallel luminous flux is emitted at a right angle to the longitudinal direction of a pipe like sintered body 0.8 mm in thickness vertical to the inner wall surface of the pipe at the inner surface thereof to the intensity of the transmitted luminous flux on the extension of the incident luminous flux of the luminous fluxes passing through the sample.Example 1 One hundred grams of oxidized microcrystalline wax m.p.780C acid value 12 mg KOH g as oxygen containing wax, 20 g of stearic acid and 1 kg of aluminum oxide powder purity, 99.9, average particle size, 0.5pom to which 0.1 of magnesium oxide had been added, were kneaded at 1600C for 10 minutes on a kneader. This mixed composition was extrusion molded at 900C to 180 0C into a pipe of 10 mm in inside diameter and 1 mm in thickness, and then heated at a temperature gradient of 500czar and maintained at 8000C for 1 hour to carry out defatting and calcination. Thereafter, the pipe was sintered at 17O00C for 3 hours in a vacuum to obtain a translucent alumina sintered pipe. The result of the pipe thus obtained is shown in Table 1. As is apparent from Table I including the result of later mentioned Comparative Examples , only the oxygencontaining wax type binder used in the invention gives flowability on molding, the molded article has a high powder packing density, time required for defatting is short, and the sintered body has high translucency. Comparative Example 1 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that paraffin wax m.p. 700C and microcrystalline wax m.p.780C each comprising hydrocarbons was used in place of the oxygen containing wax, and moldability, defatting property and the performances of sintered body were evaluated.The molded articles obtained in this Example, because of their sudden thermal decomposition on defatting, showed the generation of foams and cracks0 For this reason, in producing the sintered body, defatting was carried out by heating to 400 C at a temperature gradient of 1 C hr over a 50 times longer period of time than in Example 1. The result of evaluation is shown in Table 1. Comparative Example 2Using 20 g of stearic acid and 100 g of polystyrene in place of the wax type binder in Example 1, extrusion molding was carried out at 1800 C in the same manner as inExample 1. But, the flowability was poor so that a molded article was not obtained. Then, the amount of polystyrene was increased to 170 g, and extrusion molding and defatting were carried out in the same manner as inExample 1. Under the same defatting condition as inExample 1 however, the decomposition of polystyrene was so sudden that the molded article foamed. The sintered body was prepared by defatting at a rate of heating of 1OC hr in the same manner as in Comparative Example 1. Comparative Example 3Example 1 was repeated except that extrusion molding was carried out at room temperature using 200 g of water and 50 g of polyvinyl alcohol in place of the oxygen containing wax type binder, and moldebility, defatting property and the performances of sintered body were compared. But the molded article obtained changed in shape immediately after extrusion due to its own weight, and thus the section of pipe was not circular. Also, under the same heating condition as in Example 1, evaporation of water at a temperature in the vicinity of 100 C was so sudden that cracks were formed in the molded article.For this reason, the molded article was heated as follows so as to prevent cracks from forming in the molded article heating to 100 C at a temperature gradient of 2 C hr under saturated steam pressure heating at 100 C for 5 hours heating to 800 C at a temperature gradient of 20 C hr and then heating at 8000C for 1 hour. Thereafter, sintering was carried out in the same manner as in Example 1, but a sintered body having translucency was not obtained.Example 2A mixture of the oxygen containing wax type binder ofExample I and an aluminum oxide powder was injection molded into a molded article 20 mm wide x 50 mm long x 2 mm thick on a screw type injection molding machine under the following conditions Cylinder temperature, 1200 1800C mold temperature, room temperature pressure, 700 kg cm2 residence time in mold, 2 seconds. The molded article was homogeneous without cavities. This molded article was defatted and sintered in the same manner as in Example 1. The sintered body obtained showed good translucency.Example 3 140 g of carnauba wax m.p. 830C acid value 8 mg ,XOH g as oxygen containing wax type binder, 10 g of stearic acid and 1 kg of mangesium oxide average particle size, 1 pm containing 0,296 of magnesium fluoride were extrusion molded and defatted in the same manner as in Example 1. Thereafter, sintering was carried out at 1400 C for 2 hours in vacuum. The molded article of this example was very homogeneous and also had good strength. The sintered body obtained had translucency.
