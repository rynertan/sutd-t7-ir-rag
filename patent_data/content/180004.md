# Linear hydraulic motor having a frangible piston head.

## Abstract
A linear hydraulic motor includes a piston rod of con ventional steel carrying a frangible piston head 18 mov able in a cylinder, the head 18 being designed to break away in the event the cylinder wall is damaged such that a portion thereof becomes an obstacle in the path of the piston. Two or more such motors are frequently connected redundantly to one control surface such that if one motor is damaged, the other can continue to perform its function. The piston head 18 is of a brittle metallic matrix material and includes a conventional seal groove formed on its cylindri cal surface 40 . Each of the opposite faces of the piston head 18 contains a first deep circumferential groove 36 radially outward from the rod, a second shallower circum ferential groove 42 positioned radially outward from the first circumferential groove 36 at essentially the same radial position as the bottom of the seal groove, and a large number of radial grooves 34 effectively dividing the faces into truncated sectors outboard of the deep grooves which can break away.
