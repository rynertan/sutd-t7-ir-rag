# First use indicator for a sterile docking cutting means.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an improved resistance heating element for welding thermoplastic tubes together, particular ly for sterile welding. The improvement permits the indica tion of first use of the heating element and comprises a fusible signal means to indicate first use of the heating element. The signal means provides an electrical signal which is eliminated prior to first use by melting of the signal means thereby enabling first use to be commenced. If the electrical signal is not generated, e.g., the heating element has been used once, the sterile connection apparatus in which the heating element is used is programmed to reject the heating element, thereby eliminating risks resulting from reusing the heating element.
