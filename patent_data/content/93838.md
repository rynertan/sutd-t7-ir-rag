# Perpendicular magnetic recording medium and method for producing the same.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium conventionally utilizes the in plane magnetization mode, but recently the perpen dicular magnetization mode utilizing the perpendicular anisotropy of an hcp cobalt alloy layer, in which the C axis is oriented perpendicular to the layer surface, has been proposed. The known perpendicular magnetic recording medium is produced by means of RF sputtering and com prises a Permalloy layer, as layer of a low coercive force material between the nonmagnetic base and the hcp cobalt alloy layer. The perpendicular anisotropy attained by the present invention in very excellent and is superior to that of perpendicular recording medium having no Permalloy layer because a Co Ta alloy is used as the layer of a low coercive force material.
