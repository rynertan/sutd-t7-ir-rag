# Improved spray suppression device.

## Abstract
A laminated, spray suppression device having service properties over a wide range of use temperatures includes a non woven nylon fabric core layer to inhibit stress cracks originating at low temperatures in an embrittled, grass like low density polyethylene or polypropylene layer on one side of the core layer from propagating through to a high density polyethylene backing layer on the other side of the core layer.
