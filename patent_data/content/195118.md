# Process for the production of propylene base random copolymer particles.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein are propylene base random copolymer particles suitable for use in the production of pre foamed particles. The copolymer particles are obtained by heating starting copolymer particles to the crystallization tempera ture thereof and then quenching them in a medium of the crystallization temperature 30 C or lower. Processes for obtaining the copolymer particles are also disclosed. Pre foamed particles produced using the copolymer particles contain large cells. They can thus provide foamed moldings which are substantially free of shrinkage and have good flexibility.
