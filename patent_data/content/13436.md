# Process for preparing p,p biphenol of high purity.

## Abstract
A process for producing p,p biphenol which comprises heating a 4,4 bis substituted phenol at elevated tempera tures below the decomposition termperature of p,p biphenol in the absence of a catalyst under an inert non reactive atmosphere for the length of time sufficien to obtain a reac tion product containing a substantial amount of p,p biphenol while removing the olefin by product formed and then recov ering the p,p biphenol product. The 4,4 bis substituted phenol is made by oxidative coupling of a phenol having the formula
