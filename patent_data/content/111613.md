## Description
Machine for performing rectilinear furrows with ressure and inking. The invention refers to a machine which, with a continuous cycle, permits to obtain parallel furrows on panels, operating by pressure effect on ly. A flex design procedure allows a particular employ in the prefabricated building and arrangements in general. Conventionally panels are produced resulting from assembling of plates on woody fibrous base with PVC film or resinous paper sheet.At present, in order to obtain a depth ornamental effect, parallel furro ws are obtained by passing the panel under a battery of milling disks.This system casuses two inconveniences it interrupts the structure continuity on the visualization plane and weakens it on account of the material removal. These inconveniences turn out particularly heavy if we consider that these panels are made in extremely small thickness.The invented device permits the integral solution of these problems. A machine is employed with base casting on the ground bearing a travelling plane for passing the panel under a device for making parallel furrows.This is foreseen on a pair of columns with coaxial disposition to allow a lowering to be regulated in order to bring a frame in a transversal position and bringing the pressure furrowing assembly in operating position. The device employ a shaft with parallel threading for setting a bat tery of pressing disks at distances to be preset. By means of a crank operating on a cardan system, the movement is transmitted in a synchroni sm with the two coaxial devices. The motor assembly is then started that contemporarily moves a pair of input rollers on the travelling plane, as well as another output pair, and centrally a roller to locate the said furrowing group which, by means of the corresponding battery of pulleys brought on the shaft, strarts a corresponding battery on inking means. Inking is carried out by transmission from therelevent inkholders, by means of rollers, pen and inking device, on the furrowing disks.A not limiting execution form is illustrated in the drawings of Tables 1 and 2, where Fig. 1 is the side perspective view of the machine seen from the outlet side, with a section view of the outgetting panel. The frame can be noted, which is supported on coaxial means and with control led lowering by means of a hand crank, as well as the furrowing assemr bly brought in middle location by a positioning frame. A system of pulleys is to be seen too, which drives a battery of inking means transmit ting on the pressure rollers. Fig. 2 is the front view of the feft outlet part of the machine the system for the furrownrg device stabilization will be noted. Fig. 3 is a particular of the travelling plane on the right input side. The furrowing articolated initial part, with the inking device, and the input roller can be noted.Fig. 4 is the longitudinal section of the machine showing the mation cacprt ts. The machine foresees the panel mechanical travel on plane 1 by means of roller 2, which has below the location roller 3. The operation is carried out by pressure while the panel is passing between the lower location rol ler 4 and the above pressure compartment consisting of a parallel disk group 5. These disks perform the two tasks of furrowing by means of sque ezing, as well as of inking in the relevant cavities. The pressure disks 5 are supported on a frame with vertical translation on a pair of side coaxial devices 6 and 7 these ones, through crank 8 and with a transmits sion cardan system 9, with contemporary effect, lower frame 10 supporting shaft 11 and ball bearing with pressing battery 5 fitted on. For stabilizing the furrowing device, an intermediate connection between the frame transversal profile piece 12 and shaft 11 has been foreseen.Plate 13 equipped with ball bearing 14 is employed for rotating shaft 11 and suppor 5. These disks perform the two tasks of furrowing by means of squeezing, as well as of inking in the relevant cavities. 6 Mashine for performing rectilinear furrows with pressure and inking,ac cording to the previous claims, characterized by the fact that the pressure disks 5 are supported on a frame with vertical translation on a pair of side coaxial devices 6 and 7 these ones, through crank 8 and with a transmission cardan system 9, with contemporary effect, lower frame 10 suppor ting shaft 11 on ball bearing with pressing battery 5 fitted on.
