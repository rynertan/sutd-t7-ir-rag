# Conveyor roll for conveying heated glass sheets.

## Abstract
Apparatus for handling heated glass sheets is disclosed as being embodied by a conveyor roll 20,21,20 for conveying heated glass sheets 6 on a horizontal roller conveyor of a glass sheet processing system. The conveyor roll includes a shaft 42,70,42 having a support 44,72,80 of aromatic polyamide fibers for engaging the conveyed glass sheets. Kevlar fibers are preferably utilized for the support 44,72,80 so as to have the requisite thermal stability and resistance to cutting by broken glass. The Kevlar support is also useful on other apparatus for handling heated glass sheets such as, for example, molds used in glass bending systems, etc.
