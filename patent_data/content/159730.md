# PROCESS FOR THE REMOVAL OF SULPHUR COMPOUNDS FROM OFF GASES

## Abstract
Removal of sulphur compounds from the off gas of a sulphur recovery unit of the Claus type, in which this off gas is mixed with an H₂S rich gas to form a gas mixture having a higher H₂S to SO₂ molar ratio than the off gas, which gas mixture is passed at a temperature below 300 C over a Claus catalyst and a second off gas is separated from the catalyst, said second off gas is subsequently passed over a regenerable solid metal oxide absorbent to absorb H₂S, spent metal oxide absorbent is regene rated, thereby producing a gas rich in sulphur compounds which is introduced into a sulphur recovery unit of the Claus type.
