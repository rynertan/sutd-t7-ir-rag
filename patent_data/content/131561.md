## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING MONOADDUCTS OF OLEFINS AND TELOGENS REACTIVE THEREWITHBackground of the Invention This invention relates to the field of telomerization reactions of olefinic and acetylenic taxogens and, more particularly, to an improved process for preparing a monoadduct of a taxogen and a telogen by reaction in the presence of iron and a promoter for the reaction. Addition polymerizable olefinically unsaturated monomers are known to react with certain compounds, referred to as telogens, by a process known as telomerization, in which the telogen splits to form two monovalent terminating groups and the product contains a number of units derived from the monomer, capped on each end with moieties derived from splitting of the telogen. More particularly, there are known processes in which carbon tetrachloride acts as a telogen for the telomerization of ethylene according to the general equation EMI1.1 where n is an integer such that the molecular weight of the telomerization product is relatively low compared to the molecular weight typical of high polymers.The species where n equals 1, i.e., 1,1,1,3 tetrachloropropane is an intermediate useful for the manufacture of a variety of end products, including agricultural chemicals, pharmaceuticals, gums, silicones and the like. Accordingly, there has been a need in the art for processes by which the above reaction can be controlled to produce the 1,1,1,3 product in high yield and with high productivity, minimizing both the formation of telomerization products in which n 2 and the formation of various other reaction side products such as, for example, 1,3,3,5 tetrachloropentane. The latter by product is formed when 1,1,1,3 tetrachloropropane itself serves as a telogen in reaction with ethylene. Illustrative art relating to the reactions of carbon tetrahalides and olefins includes Thompson U.S.patent 2,658,930, Nakagawa et al. U.S. patent 3,631,115,Decker et al. U.S. patent 3,454,657, Asscher et al. U.S.patent 3,651,019, Takamizawa et al. U.S. patent 4,243,607 and Asahara et al. The Telomerization of Carbon Tetrachloride and Ethylene Kogyo Kagaku Zasshi 1971, 74 4 , 703 705. Thompson discloses reactions of olefins with carbon tetrachloride in the presence of metallic iron, water and oxygen. Yields reported by Thompson are relatively low while reaction times are very extended,Example 1 involving storage of the reactants at 380C for over three weeks. Nakagawa ethyl. disclose telomerization of an alkene taxogen with a halogenoalkane telogen in the presence of a nickel peroxide catalyst. The monomers which form the units between the capping moieties of a telomer are generically referred to in the art as taxogens. Decker et al. describe catalytic synthesis of organic halogen compounds by reacting an ethylenically un saturated compound with carbon tetrachloride or another halogenated compound in the presence of an amine compound and copper metal or copper salt. Asscher et al. note that the use of free radical catalysts such as peroxides tends to cause the ethylenecarbon tetrachloride telomerization reaction to progress to the extent that substantial portions of products in which n 2 appear in the reaction product, even where the ratio of carbon tetrachloride to olefinically unsaturated material employed is as high as 100 1. Asscher et al. describe a system in which 1 1 adducts of carbon tetrachloride and olefinically unsaturated compounds are produced in a solvent system using a catalyst consisting of a dissolved copper or iron compound. Asscher et al.note that it is essential to have ferrous iron present and disclose various reducing agents which may be incorporated in the reaction system for such purpose. According to theAsscher et al. disclosure, a special reducing agent may not be necessary in all systems since olefins and or certain solvents may serve the function of maintaining a portion of the iron in the ferrous state. Asahara et al. describe the reaction of carbon tetrachloride and ethylene in the presence of a catalyst system consisting of a trialkyl phosphite and ferric chloride hexahydrate. Asahara et al. succeed in achieving relatively rapid reaction but obtain a product containing a substantial fraction of by products, including higher telomerization products n 2 and tars. Takamizawa et al. disclose an improvement on theAsahara system in which an olefin is reacted with carbon tetrachloride in the presence of a three component catalyst system including ferric chloride hexahydrate, a trialkyl phosphite or diethyl phosphite, and a nitrile such as acetonitrile. This catalyst system enables Takamizawa et al. to obtain a reasonably high yield of product in which n 1 while reducing, but not eliminating, the formation of by product tars as compared to Asahara.Although they did not ascribe any particular significance to it, both Asahara and Takamizawa et al. used stainless steel autoclaves for carrying out their reactions. Despite the various efforts that have been made in the art to develop effective reaction systems for producing monoadducts of olefins and carbon tetrahalides, a need has remained for a system which eliminates tars and produces the n 1 product in both high selectivity and high yield at a high rate of production.Summary of the Invention Briefly, the present invention is directed to a process for producing a monoadduct of a taxogen and a telogen reactive therewith. In this process, the telogen is reacted with the taxogen in the presence of both a promoter and a source of metallic iron that is effective as an activator for the reaction. The promoter comprises a phosphorus V compound that contains a phosphoryl group. The invention is further directed to a process for preparing a monoadduct of a taxogen and a telogen reactive therewith, while substantially avoiding the formation of higher telomerization products. The process comprises reacting the telogen and the taxogen in a reaction system comprising a liquid phase and a source of metallic iron in contact with the liquid phase, the source of metallic iron being effective as an activator for the reaction. The liquid phase comprises the telogen and a promoter for the reaction. The promoter comprises a phosphorus V compound that contains a phosphoryl group and is compatible with the telogen. Description of the Preferred Embodiments In accordance with the. present invention, it has been discovered that high yield, selectivity and product tivity in the preparation of monoadducts of taxogens and telogens reactive therewith are achieved by carrying out the reaction in the presence of an active source of metallic iron and a promotor which comprises a phosphorus V compound containing a phosphoryl group. The reaction system for preparing the monoadduct includes a liquid phase that contains the telogen and is in contact with the source of metallic iron. The phosphorus compound, and preferably also a ferric salt, are dissolved in the liquid phase. Ferric salt may be either added as such to the system or generated in situ prior to commencement of the telomerization reaction.By use of such reaction systems, formation of higher telomerization products, tars and other unwanted by products is substantially eliminated and the reaction product is essentially a single phase liquid.Where the telogen is an alkyl halide such as a halo form or carbon tetrahalide, the reaction may optimally be carried out to nearly 100 conversion of the telogen. Often, the product monoadduct can be removed from the reactor and be used directly with little or no purification as an intermediate for the production of other products. Where the reaction mixture contains any unreacted material after the reaction is completed, the unreacted material can. be removed by distillation. Although the instant invention is defined only by the appended claims and is not limited to a particular theory, it is believed that the reaction is initiated by a redox transfer between telogen and ferrous ion which splits the telogen to form a free radical and a ligand which is attached to the ferric ion produced in the transfer. Thus, in the case of alkyl halide, a halide ion ligand is thought to combine with the ferrous ion in accordance with the following equation EMI6.1 where R is an alkyl group and X is halogen.According to this theory, the taxogen adds to the free radical producing another free radical that in turn undergoes a redox transfer with the ferric ion, recovering therefrom the halide ligand which forms an end cap for the telomerization product. For example, in the case of ethylene EMI6.2 EMI7.1 The cycle is then thought to be repeated by reaction of the regenerated ferrous ion with the telogen in accordance with Equation 2. Whatever the mechanism, it has been found that the presence of a source of metallic iron, which is capable of being an activator for the reaction, is essen tial to the progress of the reaction. This contrasts with the teachings of the Asahara et al. and Takamizawa et al.references which teach only the incorporation of a ferric salt in the reaction system. While the reactions of theAsahara et al. and Takamizawa et al. references were carried out in a stainless steel autoclave, the references do not reflect any appreciation that the presence of stainless steel may have contributed to the reaction. However, it has now been discovered that the unique combination of an active source of metallic iron and a phosphorus V compound containing a phosphoryl group provides high productivity, high selectivity and high yields of the monoadduct. A very wide variety of olefins and alkynes can be used as the taxogen in the process of the invention.Most advantageously, the process can be used to produce monoadducts of olefinic hydrocarbons such as ethylene, propylene, l butene, 2 butene, l hexene, 3 hexene, 2 octene, l dodecene, 4 dodecene, isoprene, 3 methyl 5heptene, l phenyl 3 hexene, butadiene, vinyl halides and the like. However, other substituted olefins such as acrylic esters, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, acrolein, vinyl esters, vinyl ethers, vinyl silanes, cinnamic acid, cinnamaldehyde, etc., can also be used. In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, the taxogen may be a polymer containing unsaturated carbon to carbon bonds, for example, a natural or synthetic rubber, and the telomerization product may be a halogenated polymer. Preferably, the non polymeric olefinic taxogens correspond to the formula EMI8.1 where each of R1, R2, R3, and R4 may be independently selected from among hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with substituents which are compatible with the reaction which forms the desired monoadduct. Such substituents are considered so compatible if they do not inhibit the desired reaction or cause competitive side reactions which proceed preferentially to the desired reaction under the prevailing reaction conditions. Other groups meeting the same compatibility criterion can also constitute R1, R2,R3 and R4. These include cyano, halogen, imido, carbonyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkenoxy, acyloxy, silyl, and phosphoryl. Substituents containing carbon preferably have 1 to about 100 carbon atoms. Useful alkynes include those corresponding to the formula EMI9.1 when R5 and R6 are independently selected from among the same substituents that may comprise RÃ to R4. Preferably, the telogen used in the reaction of the invention is an alkyl halide having 1 to about 100 carbon atoms. The process of the invention is especially suited to the preparation of adducts of alphaolefins and carbon tetrahalides such as carbon tetrachloride, carbon tetrabromide, trichlorobromomethane, dichlorodibromomethane and chlorotrifluoromethane. Use of such telogens provides an advantageous route to the introduction of the trihalomethyl groups into a variety of organic structures.Moreover, once a tribromo or trichloromethyl group is introduced, the corresponding trifluoromethyl compound may be readily produced by reaction of the telomerization product with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of antimony trifluoride. Among the other telogens which can be used in the process are halo formes such as chloroform and bromoform, as well as a variety of other alkyl halides corresponding to the formula R XWhere R is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group andX is a halogen. For rapid reaction and high yields, the alkyl halide telogen preferably contains a trihalomethyl or terminal dihalomethyl group. It has been found that the use of a phosphorus V compound containing a phosphoryl group, in the presence of an active source of metallic iron, as the reaction promotion system provides significant advantages in yield, productivity or both, as compared to previously known systems which use a trialkyl phosphite type cata lyst.. A particularly preferred class of phosphorus compounds includes alkyl and aryl phosphate esters, phosphoryl halides, phosphorus pentoxide and those phosphoryl compounds having the structureEMI10.1 where 27 is a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl group. For example, R7 may be alkyl, aryl, or alkenyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with hydroxyl, carbonyl, sulfate, amino, or halo substituents. Particular groups which may constitute R7 include methyl, ethyl, propyl, octal, vinyl, allyl, phenyl, chloroethyl, butylamino, and the like. R8 and R9 are independently selected from among hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, and the various groups which may comprise R7. As noted, the phosphorus compound is contained in the liquid phase and should, therefore, be compatible with the telogen, i.e., soluble therein at least to the extent necessary to serve as a promoter for the reaction. Exemplary phosphorus compounds suitable for use in the process of the invention include alkyl and aryl phosphate esters such as, for example. triethyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate, phenyl diethyl phosphate, diethyl phosphate, dibutyl phosphate, phenyl phosphate, butyl phosphate and the like. Other suitable phosphorus compounds include alkyl and aryl phosphonate esters such as dimethyl methylphosphonate, dimethyl ethylphosphonate, diethyl phenylphosphonate, phenyl ethyl ethylphosphonate, diethyl vinylphosphonate, butyl butyiphosphonate, triethyl phosphonoacetate, and the like. Still further suitable phosphorus V compounds include butylphosphonic acid, hexamethyl phosphoramide, phosphoryl chloride and phosphorus pentoxide.It is believed that the phosphorus conpound serves to promote oxidation and dissolution of metallic iron to produce ferrous ions in the liquid phase Such dissolved ferrous ions are thought to be involved in the initiating step of the reaction FEchinisF per equation 2, supra. While the exact role of the phosphorus compound in such postulated mechanism is not understood, it has been discovered that the presence of the phosphorus V compound has a most advantageous effect on productivity and yield. In an effective range of concentration, the reaction of carbon tetrachloride and ethylene is approximately first order with respect to concentration of free phosphorus compound as defined hereinbelow. The source of metallic iron used in the reaction system may comprise any ferrous metal which serves as an activator for the reaction. In the context of this disclosure, the term 1activator is thus defined as a ferrous metal whose presence causes the telomerisation reaction to proceed at a rate higher than the reaction rate obtained in an otherwise identical reaction system from which the activator z fizz absent. Generally effective activation is associated with corrosion of the metallic iron source to the extent of a measurable loss of weight over the course of the reaction. Materials such as carbon steel, mild steel, cast Iron and wrought iron are advantageously used as the source of metallic iron in the process. Certain stainless steels can also be used but are less preferred. Some fer roua alloys, including various stainless steels, have not been found to be effective. It hag been found that the most rapid reaction is achieved where there is a relatively high area of con tact between the source of metallic iron and the liquid phase medium. The reaction is approximately first order with respect to the contact surface between the liquid phase and the source of metallic iron. Forms of iron such as screens, powder, filings, shavings, bars, sheets, steel wool, or tubes can be used. Screens, powder and filings afford a particularly high specific surface area. Most of these iron sources can be re used in a series of batch re actionst. However, in the case of cast iron, a scale remains on the surface as the iron dissolves which may in hibit successive batch reactions. In carrying out the process of the invention, a reactor is charged with a liquid phase reactant, the phos phorus V compound and a source of iron, for example, in the form of iron bars, an iron screen or iron filings. Normally, the telogen is a liquid phase material at ambient conditions and the phosphorus V compound is dis solved therein, preferably in a proportion of between about 0.01 and about 40 mole percent based on the telogen charge, more preferably 0.1 to 20 . For the case of carbon tetrachloride and ethylene, the concentration of phosphorus compound is typically 0.05 to 20 mole percent, preferably 0.1 to 5.0 mole percent. When the taxogen is liquid, some or all of this reactant may be contained in the initial charge also, the proportion depending on the relative reactivities of taxogen and telogen. Where the taxogen is highly reactive, it is preferable to maintain an excess of telogen during the greater part of the reaction period in order to minimize formation of n 2 telomerization products. Reaction is initiated either by bringing the system containing both taxogen and telogen to reaction temperature, or by adding one reactant to a preheated system containing the other. In the case of a gaseous and or highly reactive taxogen, the reaction system may initially contain a substantial excess of telogen and, in this instance, the reaction is caused to progress by introducing taxogen into the reaction mixture While maintaining it at the aforesaid temperature. Preferably, such taxogen is introduced at a controlled rate less than or equal to the rate of reaction. By this means, an excess of telogen is present essentially throughout the reaction, thereby minimizing the formation of telomerization products in which n 2.Because of the flammability of many olefins and alkynes, air is preferably excluded from the reactor by operating under conditions where reactant pressure exceeds atmospheric, or by use of an inert gas blanket. Where the taxogen is a gas, as in the case of reaction of ethylene, propylene, or acetylene with carbon tetrachloride, the reactor containing the telogen, phosphorus v compound, and source of iron is pressurized with taxogen, and the reaction proceeds by absorption of taxogen into the liquid phase. Prior to pressurization with taxogen, the reactor is purged with an inert gas to displace oxygen. Optionally, the reactor may then be purged with taxogen to displace inert gas. In order to minimize the formation of undesired by products where n 2, the initial reactor charge preferably contains a ferric salt dissolved in the telogen in a proportion of between 0 and about 10 mole percent, the amount depending on the reactivity of the taxogen and its tendency to form higher telomerization products. The ferric salt, most preferably ferric chloride, can be added to the telogen either directly or in an organic solvent solution. Alternatively, the ferric salt may be generated in situ by heating a reaction system containing an alkyl halide telogen, phosphorus compound and source of metallic iron at a temperature and for a time adequate to inhibit formation of higher telomerization products. Conveniently, in situ generation of ferric salt can be carried out at a temperature of 500C or higher, preferably near the reaction temperature. thus, including the case where no initial ferric salt is charged to the system, there are three alternative protocols for initiating the reaction. These are summarized below in Table 1. Table 1 Taxogen Hold Time Fe Initially Prior to InitiallyCase Present Taxogen Charge Charged 1 Yes No Yes 2 Yes No No 3 No Yes NoAlthough ferric iron is believed to be ultimately generated in case 2 as well as cases 1 and 3, the initial concentration may be insufficient to prevent formation of significant amounts of n 5 2 by products during the early stages of the reaction. Thus, cases 1 and 3 are preferred, case 3 being advantageous in avoiding the necessity for handling ferric salt and adding it as such as to the reactor. As indicated above, a relatively high ratio of ferric ion to taxogen concentration or taxogen partial pressure has been observed to favor termination of reaction by capping with the ligand split from the telogen, while a relatively low ratio favors addition of more than one taxogen unit prior to capping. While this relationship therefore indicates the desirability of an initial ferric salt charge, it has also been found important that the reacting mixture contain a molar excess of phosphorus V compound with respect to ferric compound throughout the course of the reaction. Unless there is such an excess, the reaction essentially stops, possibly because iron ions tie up the phosphorus compound in a reaction product or 1 1 complex, thereby precluding further action of the phosphorous compound as a promoter.This reaction product or complex is believed to remain effective as a source of ferric ions which limit the formation of n 2 telomerization products but not as a promoter for initiating the olefin telogen reaction. Because phosphorus compound appears to be depleted over the course of the reaction while the proportion of ferric ion typically grows, the initial charge should contain an excess of phosphorus compound somewhat greater than that needed to sustain the reaction. Given the reactivity of the taxogen and telogen, an appropriate excess can be readily arrived at. Progress of the reaction depends upon maintaining a supply of both free phosphorus compound and metallic iron throughout the reaction period. In order to assure the continued availability of phosphorus compound and metallic iron, it is, therefore, necessary to control not only the initial phosphorus compound and ferric chloride content but also the overall quantity of metallic iron available for dissolution and also the area of contact between the liquid phase and the source of metallic iron. Intensity of agitation also affects this balance. For any given system, those skilled in the art may readily arrive at an appropriate combination of these parameters, which are not narrowly critical. Preferably, the system is operated with vigorous agitation and contains a semi permanent iron source, i.e., a quantity of iron sufficient to provide for several batches or several multiples of residence time in a continuous system without significant variation in surface area. Such a system both provides high productivity and facilitates maintenance of an effective supply of both phosphorus compound and metallic iron. Vigorous agitation is particularly desirable for promotion of mass transfer of taxogen into the liquid phase where the taxogen is in the gaseous state under the conditions prevailing in the reaction. However, agitation is also considered important to promote mass transfer between the bulk liquid phase and the surface of the source of metallic iron. Based on the results observed, dissolution of a measurable amount of iron into the reacting mixture is important to the progress of the reaction. Whether the dissolution of the iron produces ferrous ions which initiate reaction in the bulk liquid phase in accordance with the mechanism postulated above, or whether reaction occurs, for example, at the surface of the source of iron, agitation is considered important for promoting mass transfer between that surface and the bulk liquid. Generally, the reaction should be carried out at a temperature which is high enough to provide rapid conversion but low enough to avoid thermal degradation of reactants or products and formation of excessive by products or tars. The optimum reaction temperature may vary with the nature of the taxogen and telogen and, in any event, is not narrowly critical. In the case of the reaction of ethylene and carbon tetrachloride, a preferred reaction temperature is between about 700C and about 1300C, preferably 800C to 1250C. When the taxogen is in the gaseous state at reaction conditions, conversion rate tends to increase with increasing taxogen partial pressure, but so too does the formation of by products, especially n 2 telomerization products. Thus, it is preferred that taxogen pressure be maintained at the lowest level consistent with good productivity. In the case of the reaction of ethylene with carbon tetrachloride, satisfactory rates of reaction can be obtained without excessive by product formation at a gauge pressure in the range of from about 1 x 105 Pa to about 14 x 105 Pa about 1 to about 14 atmospheres . For propylene reactions, the preferred range of reaction pressure is somewhat lower but is not narrowly critical. Under a given set of reaction conditions, by product formation may further be controlled by terminating the reaction short of 100 conversion. However, it has been found that by use of a reaction promotion system comprising a phosphorus V compound and a source of metallic iron, very high conversions can be achieved without significant formation of n 2 telomerization products or of other by products. Thus, for example, in the case of the reaction of ethylene and carbon tetrachloride, optimal conversion, that is, conversion with low by product formation, has been determined to be about 99.3 . Moreover, the optimum is not a sharp one and industrial process control is facilitated by the existence of an optimal plateau at conversions in the range of about 98.8 to about 99.8 . Similarly high conversions are commercially advantageous for reactions of other telogens and other taxogens in accordance with the process of the invention. However, for all taxogens the reaction should be terminated as soon as practicable after the desired conversion is reached, so as to avoid overreaction and formation of by products. The presence of water has been found to have a deleterious effect on the rate of reaction in the process of the invention. Thus, to provide for maximum yields and selectivity, the ferrous salt initially charged to the reaction mixture is preferably anhydrous. Other components of the reaction mixture are preferably also devoid of free water. Preferably, the water content of the liquid phase is maintained at not higher than about 0.5 mole percent during the course of the reaction. Although the process of the invention is conveniently carried out batch wise, it is also adapted for continuous operation, for example, in a cascaded stirred tank reaction system. While the reacting mixture is less corrosive to certain stainless steels than the phosphite systems of Asahara et al. and Takamizawa et al., it nonetheless attacks various alloys of iron. Consequently, glass lined or nickel alloy reactors should be used. It may be convenient to dispose the source of iron in a separate vessel in an external circulation loop through which the liquid phase reaction mixture is pumped during the reaction. In many instances the product of the reaction is a substantially single phase material which may be used as an end product or intermediate without the necessity o extensive separation or purification steps. In certain cases, for example, the reaction of carbon tetrahalide and ethylene in the presence of triethyl phosphate, a very minor amount of a lighter second phase separates from the reaction product. In a batch reaction system, this second phase may advantageously be preserved as a heel in the reaction and used as a source of ferric salt and phosphorus compound for the next batch. Monoadducts of taxogens and telogens are produced by the process of the invention at high yield, high selectivity and high productivity without undue risk of runaway reaction or explosion. Safe operation and effective process control are readily achieved. Formation of tars is essentially avoided. Solvents or catalyst modifiers such as acetonitrile are not needed in the process, so that high reactor payloads can be obtained, further contributing to productivity. For these reasons, and because the process provides the opportunity for use of relatively inexpensive raw materials, the present invention affords a means for highly economical production of 1,1,1,3 tetrachloropropane as well as a large variety of other monoadducts of taxogens and telogens. The following examples illustrate the invention.Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages are given on a weight basis. Example 1 Carbon tetrachloride 267 g , ferric chloride 1.00 g , triethyl phosphate 2.74 g , and an iron wire 0.023 cm diameter, 1.43 g wrapped around a Teflon polymeric fluorocarbon rod 0.64 cm diameter were placed in a 300 ml Hastelloy C autoclave equipped with a stirrer, an internal cooling coil and an external heating mantle. The autoclave was flushed twice with nitrogen and once with ethylene, then pressurized to approximately 3.4 x 105 Pa gauge 3.4 atm gauge with ethylene and sealed. The mixture contained in the autoclave was stirred at 600 rpm and heated to 1200C, at which temperature the pressure was observed to be approximately 11.0 x 105 Pa gauge 10.9 atm gauge . As a result of the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with ethylene, the pressure in the autoclave then dropped rapidly.When the pressure dropped below about 9.8 x 105 Pa gauge 9.7 atm gauge , the ethylene feed valve was reopened and the autoclave repressurized to about 9.8 x 105 Pa gauge 9.7 atm gauge and maintained at that pressure for a total of 240 minutes. the reactor was then cooled and vented. A product mixture 318 g was obtained.No tars or solids were produced. However, a slight flowable second phase did separate upon standing. The product mixture was analyzed and found to contain 94.8 by weight of 1,1,1,3 tetrachloropropane. Only 0.3 of carbon tetrachloride remained. The yield based on carbon tetrachloride initially present was 95.6 . The iron wire was weighed, and it was determined that 0.31 g of iron had dissolved in the reaction mixture during the course of the reaction. Example 2 Using the method and apparatus generally described in Example 1, carbon tetrachloride 263 g was reacted with ethylene at about 9.8 x 105 Pa gauge 9.7 atm gauge in the presence of initially added tributyl phosphate 2.42 g , ferric chloride 1.00 g and iron powder 100 mesh, 1.41 g . A product mixture 315 g was obtained, from which no second phase separated upon stand ing. No tars or solids were produced. The reaction required 210 minutes at 1200C to reach completion. The product mixture was analyzed and found to contain 93.9 by weight of 1,1,1,3 tetrachloropropane. Only 0.3 carbon tetrachloride remained. The yield based on carbon tetrachloride initially present was 95.2 . Example 3 Using the method and apparatus generally described in Example 1, carbon tetrachloride 272 g was reacted with ethylene at about 6.9 x 105 Pa gauge 6.8 atm gauge in the presence of triethyl phosphate 4.16 g , ferric chloride 1.00 g and a mild steel rod surface area 13 cmÃª . A product mixture 325 g , similar in nature to the product mixture in Example 1, was obtained. The reaction required 326 minutes at 1200C to reach completion.The product mixture was analyzed and found to contain 95.9 by weight of 1,1,1,3 tetrachloropropane. Only 0.9 carbon tetrachloride remained. The yield based on carbon tetrachloride initially present was 96.9 . The mild steel rod was weighed, and it was determined that 0.53 g of iron had dissolved in the reaction mixture during the course of the reaction Example 4 Carbon tetrachloride 273 g , triethyl phosphate 4.05 g , ferric chloride 1.03 g , and two mild steel rods having a total surface area of 26 cmÃª were charged to a 300 ml Hastellqy C autoclave provided with an internal cooling coil.
