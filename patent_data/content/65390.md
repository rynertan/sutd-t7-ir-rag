## Description
PURIFICATION OF SUCROSE ESTERSThe present invention relates to the purification of sucrose esters of fatty acids.Sucrose esters of fatty acids also known simply as sucrose esters are usually produced by a transesterification reaction in which sucrose is made to react with a fatty acid ester, typically either an alkyl ester of the fatty acid or a triglyceride.Conventionally the transesterification has been carried out in a homogenous or quasi homogenous reaction medium in the presence of a catalyst. For instance, there have been proposals to effect the reaction in a solvent see, for example, USA patent No 3 714 144 , or in a transparent emulsion see, for example, USA patent No 3 480 616 . In general, the catalyst is a basic material, with the alkali metal salts of weak acids being particuarly preferred. More recently, we have developed an alternative catalysed transesterification procedure which is based on the use of heterogenous conditions see UK patent No 1 399 053 andNo 1 499 989 and which gives a surfactant containing sucrose esters.In practice, and despite the variety of available processes for manufacturing the sucrose esters of fatty acids, none directly gives a sucrose ester with high purity.Specifically, the available procedures give products which contain not only the mono , di and higher fatty acid esters of sucrose, but usually also any catalyst employed in the reaction, unreacted sucrose and or starting ester, and byproducts derived from the sucrose and or starting ester. The typical product obtained directly from a transesterification reaction is thus a complex mixture of components.Consider for example, the transesterification of sucrose with tallow, a naturally occurring triglyceride. Tallow in fact contains many triglycerides, reflecting the various fatty acids which are present to make up the fatty acid profile of tallow. For this example, the simplification is therefore made that the starting ester is glyceryl tristearate, that is, the main triglyceride in tallow. Then assuming that the catalyst is sodium methoxide, and ignoring the possible presence of solvent, emulsifier or other reaction aid, the typical product might contain sucrose monostearate, sucrose distearate, higher stearates of sucrose, unreacted sucrose, caramelized sucrose, unreacted glyceryl tristearate, glyceryl distearate, glyceryl monostearate, glycerol, methanol and sodium stearate.While such impure products can be used directly as surfactants or for some other applications, there is a need for purification procedures which will give the sucrose monoand di esters of the fatty acid, either relatively pure or in admixture as sucroglycerides with mono , di and triglycerides obtained when the starting ester is a triglyceride.Thus, for example, there is an EEC European EconomicCommunity Specification No E473 which lays down a standard for sucrose esters of food fatty acids and which can be summarized as shown in the following Table 1. Similarly, for sucroglycerides there is EEC Specification No E474, also summarized in Table 1. The amounts shown in Table 1 are in weight percentages. Table 1Component E 473 E474 Sucrose Esters Sucroglycerides mono and diesters of sucrose with edible fatty acids 80 or more 40 to 60 glycerides 20 or less 40 to 60 free sucrose 5 or less 5 or less free fatty acid 3 or less 3 or less sulphated ash 2 or less 2 or less residual permitted solvent as specified as specifiedThere is a set WHO FAO specification FAO Food and NutritionPaper No 4 1978 giving a recommended procedure for analysing sucrose ester products. The application of this standard procedure to some sucrose ester products suggests that in the past there has been a certain optimism on purity. Indeed, if one reconsiders the literature on the production and purification of sucrose esters, it is possible to see that many statments on yield and purity are of doubtful validity.The WHO FAO procedure is itself based onBertrand s assay and is partly empirical in that an adjusting factor of 1 0.503 is applied to the analytical data. Thus even this analytical method is not free from criticism. Put simply, analytical techniques such as gas chromatography are still being improved to permit a more realistic appraisal of the purity of sucrose ester products.Some purification procedures have been developed which might enable one to purify crude sucrose esters and obtain a product in accordance with a desired specification, for example the EEC Specification No E473 or E474.However, while these known procedures work on a laboratory scale, we find that there are sometimes difficulties in reducing sufficiently the level of free sucrose, sucrose derived coloured matter and other water soluble impurities in order to give a product conforming with a given product specification.In accordance with the present invention we provide a process for purifying a sucrose ester containing material obtained by base catalysed transesterification of sucrose with a fatty acid ester, the fatty acid profile preferably including at least 50 of one or more acids with 16 or more carbon atoms and preferably including 5 to 50 of one or more acids with unsaturation, which process comprises the steps of i acidifying an aqueous dispersion of the material to between pH 4 and 7 to give an aqueous phase and an organic phase ii at or above the melt temperature of the organic phase, recovering the organic phase iii mixing the organic phase with ethyl acetate containing 0 to 4 water, to give at a temperature of o to 200C a liquid phase and a solid phase and iv recovering the solid phase as a sucrose ester rich product.By the adoption of the present process it is readily possible to remove appreciable proportions of soaps and other impurities from a crude sucrose ester. In particular, it is now possible to take crude products produced in accordance with the process of UK patent No 1339053 and obtain on an industrial scale sucrose esters or sucroglycerides meeting the respective EEC Specification No E473 or E474.The present invention is applicable not only to crude sucrose ester products produced in accordance with the process of UK patent No 1399053, but also to other sucrose ester containing materials. The process can be used for example on other crude products derived from triglycerides as well as on crude products derived from alkyl esters, and on partially purified products. For instance the process can be employed with sucrose ester products obtained using a process in accordance with the process of UK patent No 1399053 which have then been partially purified by extraction of glycerides and other extractable material using a solvent such as ethyl acetate.The present process is generally applicable to the purification of sucrose esters of fatty acids. In practice the process is easier to operate if at least 50 of the acids are higher fatty acids having 16 or more carbon atoms . It is also desirable that 5 to 50 , more usually 20 to 45 , of the acids are unsaturated. However, the process can readily be made to work with other fatty acid esters, such as those of coconut oil, provided that certain elementary precautions are taken in handling the acidified dispersion at step i and the organic phase at steps ii and iii . In particular, the acidified dispersion has a tendency to emulsify, while in steps ii and iii some cooling may be needed. Examples of sucrose esters with which the process can be performed include those with oleic, stearic, tallow, coconut, palm, palm kernel and other single or mixed fatty acids. The lauric and other lower esters have greater water solubility, and a lower melting point, but nevertheless the present process can be used with such materials.In the present process, an aqueous dispersion of the material to be purified is acidified at step i . The solution suitably contains 5 to 15 of the material, and is preferably at below the melt temperature subsequently specified for step ii . Thus, for a tallow derived sucrose ester material produced by the process of UK patent No 1399053, the solution is preferably held at 20 to 400C for the addition of acid.For preference the acid is a concentrated inorganic or organic acid, with examples including glacial acetic acid, concentrated sulphuric, hydrochloric, or nitric acid.Sufficient acid is added to give a pH of 4 to 7, more usually around pH 4.5 with weak organic acids or approaching pH 7 with strong mineral acids. The acidification converts soaps to the corresponding free fatty acids.The free fatty acids, especially the higher fatty acids, do not have appreciable solubility in water, and form an organic phase with the sucrose esters and other organic matter. If the temperature is below the melt temperature the organic phase usually takes the form of a floc suspended in the aqueous phase. The aqueous phase will contain most of the sucrose present in the crude material and lesser amounts of the other components, along with salts resulting from the acidification.In the step ii , the organic phase obtained in step i is recovered at or above the melt temperature of the organic phase. Thus, gentle heating of the system results in melting of the free fatty acids, with a temperature of about 500C being appropriate for the tallow derived crude material mentioned above. The melted organic phase can then be separated off, and further purified if desired. For example, the organic phase can be mixed with cold water, warmed to give separate liquid phases, and the organic phase separated off and evaporated to remove water. The organic phase can be drawn off in simple manner where there is good phase separation, though filtering or centrifuging can be employed if needed.The recovered organic phase is typically a semi viscous mobile oil which sets on standing at room temperature. It is essentially free of sucrose, inorganic salts, soaps and added acid, and containing less than 1.5 water. For convenience, the oil can be held at up to 800C to enhance mobility.In the step iii , the oil representing the recovered organic phase is mixed with ethyl acetate containing 0 to 4 water the ethyl acetate can be dry or nearly dry. Suitably the oil ethyl acetate ratio is between 1 10 and 1 3, expressed as kg dm3, for example from 1 5 to 1 7. With the mixture at 0 to 200C, a solid phase is obtained which is rich in sucrose esters, together with a liquid phase based on the ethyl acetate and typically containing free fatty acids and some of the initial fatty acid ester alKyl ester or triglyceride , as well as by products formed from the initial ester. One or more extractions with the ethyl acetate can be used, preferably two to four extractions using a higher temperature at each extraction.The temperature for at least the first extraction is in the range 0 to 200CIn the step iv , the solid phase is recovered, usually by centrifuging. If desired, the recovered solid phase can be further purified. For example, it can be mixed with further ethyl acetate, and the resultant solid phase dried under vacuum.By adoption of the present process, it is now possible to take a crude brown mixture resulting from a triglyceride transesterification and obtain an off white free flowing powder which meets the EEC Specification No E473 for sucrose esters.The present invention is illustrated by the following non limiting examples.In the examples the following abbreviations are employed G glycerolSo soapSu sugarMg monoglycerideMe monoesterDg diglycerideDe diesterTg triglycerideFFA free fatty acidIs inorganic saltsThe analyses were performed using gas chromatography after silylation. The esters are calculated on dominant single ester peaks. For example, tallow monoesters are estimated on the basis of sucrose monostearate using calibrated response factors.The use of gas chromatography allows rapid and relatively accurate analysis of the complex mixtures. However, preferential extraction may lead to some error in the analyses for example if other esters are extracted in preference to sucrose monostearate, thereby altering the fatty aicd profile of tallow . As such, the analyses do not total 100 . Furthermore, the gas chromatography does not detect the inorganic salts which do not silylate , again explaining why the analyses do not total 1008. For each example the material to be purified was obtined by transesterification of sucrose with tallow, using a process in accordance with UK patent No 1399053. In general the unpurified material was tan brown in colour.Example 1 1 kg of crude tallow derived sucrose ester material with the following analysis was purified G So Su MG ME DG DE TG TOTAL 1.9 28.3 21.0 13.2 16.2 4.3 7.8 1.3 94 3The crude material was dispersed in 6 dm of water at room temperature and 183 g glacial acetic acid in 175 cm3 water was added in portions. The acidified mixture was stirred for 1 2 hour and then warmed to 500C which caused the organic phase to melt. The lower aqueous layer was removed and 6 dm process water added to the melt. The mixture was stirred and the temperature once again brought to 500C. The lower aqueous layer was removed and a further 6 dm3 process water added to the solid.

The insoluble material coalesced and the lower aqueous layer was removed.The crude FFA containing mixture was then made up to 10 dm3 with process water, stirred and heated to 500C. Coagulation occurred and the liquor was removed.This treatment with process water was repeated.The total amount of solids removed by the three washings was 380.5g of which l93.4g was sucrose. Ester losses, due to acidic hydrolysis of the glycoside linkage and or dissolution of the esters in the wash water, were negligible.The wet mixture was then dried on a Büchi evaporator and in a vacuum oven at 600C overnight.The dried oil amounted to 679.6g and had the following analysis G So FFA Su MG ME DG DE TG TOTAL 0.4 34.6 17.9 22.7 11.7 11.9 1.6 101.0The total sucrose ester content was thus 235.lg, which represents a 99.6 recovery at this stage.

The solid was dnce again made up to its original volume with water and then heated to 750C for half an hour. The turbid lower layer was removed, evaporated and analysed.The analysis showed that this final washing contained 1 of the total esters together with fatty acids and mixed glycerides, indicating that they were present as an emulsion.The dried oil was extracted twice with 6 volumes of cold dry ethyl acetate to produce esters which gave the following analysis G So FFA Su MG ME DG DE TG TOTAL 0 2.0 2.0 1.9 1.4 76.8 0.4 16.8 0.1 101.4Example 4A large scale purification was carried out on material with the analysis shown in Table 2 TABLE 2 Kilograms Dry wt G 1.6 1.6So 26.0 26.0Su 22.3 22.3MG 10.5 10.5ME 14.8 14.8DG 8.7 8.7DE 8.9 8.9TG 5.3 5.3IS 1.9 1.9TOTAL 100 100The crude product thus contains 23.7 sucrose mono and die esters, 24.5 glycerides and 51.8 soaps, sucrose and other impurities.100 kilograms of the crude material was mixed with 1000 kilograms of water at 250C. 20 kilograms. of 80 acetic acid was then added to the solution resulting in the production of a floc. On raising the temperature to 500C, the floc separated as a molten upper layer. The lower, coloured aqueous layer was drained off.The upper layer was then washed with 1000 kilograms of cold water giving a fine dispersion. On raising the temperature to 500C, a separation of the phases occurred. After a period of settling, the lower aqueous layer was drained off.Cold water was then added in a volume approximately equal to that of the remaining organic phase, and further washing carried out under agitation. The temperaturee was then raised to 800C to effect a separation of the phases, and the lower aqueous layer again discarded.As a result, a semi viscous mobile oil was obtained. The oil was then passed through a wiped film evaporator to remove water. The evaporation was carried out umder partial vacuum with a surface temperature of 140 to 1700C.The resultant dry oil had the composition shown in the following Table 3.

Although the products contained 7 99w fatty acid, the recovery of esters in the product the residue after Biichi evaporation and also the content of the esters therein were good.

The residue further contained 9.2 of the fatty acid.Of the results shown in Table 5, the best one is taken to be that employing 9.05 solids in ethyl acetate at 2 water content. This experiment gave a residue rich in sucrose esters, poor in fatty acid, and with good recovery of the esters into the residue.Example 6A sample of crude sucrose ester material similar to that employed in Example 4 was extracted with ethyl acetate to remove glycerides.
