# Heating apparatus for shrink tubing.

## Abstract
Apparatus comprises a heater 32 which introduces hot air into an elongate duct 34 via an aperture 38 midway between the open ends 58, 59 of the duct. The duct 34 has parallel slots 36, 37 in opposite walls thereof which extend between the ends 58, 59 in the plane of a conveyor 40 which grips wire leads 5 and transports them laterally so termin ated ends lie in the duct. Heat shrink tubing sections 6 pre positioned on the end of lead 5 may be positioned to protrude from the slot 37 so not exposed to hot air in the duct 34 which prevents shrinkage of tubing 6 over the terminated end.
