# A METHOD OF HEAT TREATING HIGH CHROMIUM CAST FERROUS BASED ALLOYS AND A WEARING ELEMENT FORMED OF A HIGH CHROMIUM CAST FERROUS BASED ALLOY

## Abstract
A method of heat treating a component formed of a high chromium cast ferrous based alloy consisting of 11 28 wt chromium, 1 3.6 wt carbon and at least 0.2 wt molybden um and or at least 0.6 wt tungsten, the remain der apart from any incidental ingredients and impurities being iron, said method comprising the steps of a holding said component at a temperature between the solidus temperature of the alloy and 1050 C for a period of time not exceeding 3 days in a non oxidising atmosphere or vacuum so as to produce a partially spheroidised hard carbide phase in an austenitic matrix throughout the compo nent, and b quenching the component at a mean rate of from 40 C min to 3 C min in the critical temperature range in order to retain the austenitic matrix. Before heat treament, carbon and chromium form a hard sharp, angular carbide phase and the molybdenum and or tungsten serves to increase the rate of change in the morphology of the carbidge phase during heat treatment from sharp angularity to a partly spheroidised morphology.
