## Description
This invention relates a to novel fluorophenoxy compounds, b to herbicidal compositions of such novel compounds and c to methods of using such compounds for the preemergent and postemergent control of grassy weeds in non crop areas as well as in the presence of certain valuable crops such as soybeans, cotton and wheat. BE A 834,495, issued February 2, 1976, as well as the published German patent application equivalent thereto, viz., No. 2,546,251, published April 29, 1976, describe 2 4 pyridinyl 2 oxy phenoxy alkanoic acids, salts and esters having halo substitution in the 3 and or 5 ring positions in the pyridine ring. Later references, e.g. published GB A 2,026,865 disclose such compounds having trifluoromethyl substitution on the pyridine ring and EP B 0002800 describes the enhanced effect of the D stereoisomers of such compounds. EP A 0083556 discloses certain 2 4 pyridinyl 2 oxy phenoxy alkanoic acids. The compounds which are described therein do not have any substituents on the phenyl ring. JP 55 111467 relates to certain 4 5 trifluoromethyl pyridin 2 yloxy halophenoxy alkane carboxylic acid derivatives. The Specification discloses certain compounds which have a chlorine or bromine atom at the 2 position on the phenyl ring, or a fluorine atom at the 3 position on the phenyl ring. There is no disclosure in this specification of compounds with a fluorine atome at the 2 position on the phenyl ring. The present invention is directed to novel fluorophenoxy compounds having herbicidal activity and which correspond to the formula wherein Ar represents the group wherein X is halogen and Y is halogen, CF₃, CHF₂ or CClF₂ The invention is also directed to the novel stereoisomers of such compounds, the A variety of herbicidal compounds containing substituted pyridyl and phenoxy moieties joined via a bivalent 0 or S are described in the art. For example, US A 4,046,553 US A 4,317,913 US A 4,267,336 US A 4,213,774 US A 4,324,627 and US A 4,309,547 U.S. 262,063 and 261,109, both filed July 30, 1980 EP B 483 and EP A 1473 EP A 4433 EP A 50,019 50,097 EP A 75,840 and EP A 83,556 all describe such compounds, methods of making them, compositions containing them and methods of utilizing said compositions. Given the appropriate starting materials, the compounds of this invention can be prepared by methods described in the above mentioned prior art, and can be utilized in compositions as described in said prior art. The above derivatives can be made by processes generally known to those skilled in the art and as described in the above mentioned patents. R² is preferably a carboxylic acid group, an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt thereof, an ammonium salt thereof or a C In the formula for the aforementioned novel compounds, X is advantageously Cl or F, and Y is advantageously CF₃. The group is preferably wherein R is methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, isobutyl or n butyl. The compounds of the above formula, hereinafter referred to for convenience as active ingredients , have been found to be especially active as herbicides for the control of undesired vegetation, for example, grassy or graminaceous weeds and are unexpectedly more effective than the compounds of the known art. With the compounds of this invention, it is possible to employ lower dosage rates and still obtain effective control, thus reducing plant residues and any potential environmental contamination and or toxicological effect on fish and warm blooded animals. Accordingly, the present invention also encompasses herbicidal compositions containing one or more of these active ingredients as well as preemergent and postemergent methods of controlling undesired plant growth, especially in the presence of valuable crops. Such methods comprise applying a herbicidally effective amount of one or more of said active ingredients to the locus of the undesired plants, that is, the seeds, foliage, rhizomes, stems and roots or other parts of the growing plants or soil in which the plants are growing or may be found. The term herbicide is used herein to mean an active ingredient which controls or adversely modifies the growth of plants because of phytotoxic or other effects substantial enough to seriously retard the growth of the plant or further to damage the plant sufficiently to kill the plant. By growth controlling or herbicidally effective amount is meant an amount of active ingredient which causes a modifying effect and includes deviations from natural development, killing, regulation, desiccation and or retardation. The term plants is meant to include germinant seeds, emerging seedlings, rhizomes, stolons and other underground propagules, and established vegetation. The active ingredients, i. e., new compounds, of the present invention are readily prepared by processes described in the above cited prior art and as illustrated in the following examples by choosing the appropriate starting materials. The stereoisomers are readily separated as described in EP B 2800 referred to above.

The compounds of the present invention have been found to be suitable for use in methods for the selective pre and postemergent control of annual and perennial grassy weeds. These compounds, the active ingredients of the present invention, have been found to have advantage over prior art compounds in the control of annual and perennial grassy weeds in that the present compounds control such weeds at substantially lower dosage rates. In addition, the present compounds are sufficiently tolerant towards most broad leafed crops to contemplate control of grassy weeds therein at substantially commercially practicable levels, particularly so with the preferred compounds. In addition, certain of the compounds have sufficient tolerance towards cereal crops such as wheat to enable selective grassy weed control in these crops as well. For such uses, unmodified active ingredients of the present invention can be employed. However, the present invention embraces the use of the compounds in composition form with an inert material, known in the art as an agricultural adjuvant or carrier, in solid or liquid form. Thus, for example, an active ingredient can be dispersed on a finely divided solid and employed therein as a dust or granule. Also, the active ingredients, as liquid concentrates or solid compositions comprising one or more of the active ingredients can be dispersed in water, typically with aid of a wetting agent, and the resulting aqueous dispersion employed as a spray. In other procedures, the active ingredients can be employed as a constituent of organic liquid compositions, oil in water and water in oil emulsions or water dispersions, with or without the addition of wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agents. suitable adjuvants of the foregoing type are well known to those skilled in the art. The herbicidally effective concentration of the active ingredients in solid or liquid compositions generally is from 0.0003 to 95 percent by weight or more. concentrations from 0.05 to 50 percent by weight are often employed. In compositions to be employed as concentrates, the active ingredient can be present in a concentration from 5 to 98 weight percent. The active ingredient compositions can also contain other compatible additaments, for example, phytotoxicants, plant growth regulants and other biologically active compounds used in agriculture. In further embodiments, the compounds of the present invention or compositions containing the same, can be advantageously employed in combination with one or more additional pesticidal compounds. Such additional pesticidal compounds may be insecticides, nematocides, miticides, arthropodicides, herbicides, fungicides or bactericides that are compatible with the compounds of the present invention in the medium selected for application and not antagonistic to the activity of the present compounds. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the pesticidal compound is employed as a supplemental toxicant for the same or for a different pesticidal use or as an additament. The compounds in combination can generally be present in a ratio of from 1 to 100 parts of the compound of the present invention with from 100 to 1 parts of the additional compound s . The active ingredients of the present invention have been found to possess desirable herbicidal activity in general against grassy weeds such as foxtail, barnyard grass, wild oats, seedling johnsongrass and crabgrass in preemergent operations and also against the same grasses in postemergent operations while being tolerant to important broadleaf crops such as cotton, soybeans, sugarbeets and rape and in the case of certain of the compounds, certain cereal crops such as wheat. These compounds are also uniquely effective in selectively controlling perennial grassy weeds such as johnsongrass, quackgrass, bermudagrass and dallisgrass. The active ingredients of the present invention have been found to possess particularly desirable herbicidal activity against wild oats, foxtail, barnyard grass, crabgrass and seedling johnsongrass in postemergent operations as well as desirable broad spectrum activity against the perennial grassy weeds listed above and at lower dosage rates than the substituted propanoates and propanols of the prior art while showing high selectivity to broadleaf crops and, in the case of certain of the compounds, wheat. The exact rate to be applied is dependent not only on a specific active ingredient being applied, but also on a particular action desired, the plant species to be modified and the stage of growth thereof as well as the part of the plant to be contacted with the toxic active ingredient. Thus, all of the active ingredients of the present invention and compositions containing the same may not be equally effective at similar concentrations or against the same plant species. In postemergent operations a dosage of 0.005 to 20 pounds acre 0.0056 22.4 kg hectare is generally applicable, although not all compounds are equally effective and some weeds are more difficult to control. Thus, a dosage rate in the range of 0.01 to 1.0 pound acre 0.01 1.12 kg hectare is preferred in postemergent control of annual grassy weeds, while 0.05 to 5 pounds acre 0.056 5.6 kg hectare is a preferred dosage range for the postemergent control of perennial grassy weeds. In applications to tolerant crops a weed controlling but less than crop damaging amount of from .005 to 1.0 lb acre 0.0056 to 1.12 kgs hectare is generally employed. In preemergent operations a dosage rate of 0.01 to 10 lbs acre 0.011 to 11.2 kgs hectare , preferably 0.05 to 2.0 lbs acre 0.056 to 2.25 kgs hectare and most preferably 0.1 to 1 lb acre 0.11 to 1.12 kgs hectare is generally employed. The following examples illustrate effects of the compounds of this invention. In representative operations, each compound to be utilized in a series of tests is dissolved in acetone to one half of the final volume twice the final concentration to be used and the acetone solution in each case is admixed with an equal volume of water containing 0.1 percent by weight of the non ionic surfactant TWEEN 20 a polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate . The compositions, generally in the nature of an emulsion, were employed to spray separate respective plant species which had been grown to a height of 2 6 inches in soil of good nutrient content in a greenhouse. Sufficient amounts were employed to provide various application rates as listed in the table. The various beds were positioned side by side and exposed to substantially identical conditions of temperature and light. Each bed was maintained so as to prevent any interaction with test compounds in different seed beds. Other portions of the plants were left untreated to serve as controls. After treatment, the plants were maintained for about two weeks under greenhouse conditions conducive for good plant growth and watered as necessary. The specific plant species, test compound and dosage and the percent postemergent control obtained are set forth in the table below. Control refers to the reduction in growth compared to the observed results of the same untreated species. Note the NT means not tested . Plant species in these tests were the following So as to clearly illustrate the phytotoxic properties of the various active ingredients of the present invention applied preemergently, a controlled greenhouse experiment is described below. The seeds of various species of plants were planted in beds of good agricultural soil in a greenhouse. A number of compositions of the present invention, generally in the nature of an aqueous emulsion, were applied at rates listed in the table so as to deposit a predetermined amount of active ingredients uniformly throughout the surface of the bed. Another seed bed was treated only with water to serve as a control. After treatment, the seed beds were maintained for two weeks under greenhouse conditions conductive for good plant growth and watered as necessary. The specific plant species, test compound, and dosage and the percent preemergent control are set forth in the table below. Control refers to the reduction in growth compared to the observed results of the same untreated species.
