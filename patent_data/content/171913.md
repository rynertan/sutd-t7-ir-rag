# Low energy fuses.

## Abstract
A low energy fuse which has a tubular casing that is deformed at at least one end and intermediate its ends to form valve formations. Each valve formation defines a valve that is normally substantially closed and which is opened, in use, by a shock wave. Wall material of the casing may be deformed by heated displaceable forming elements. The deformed wall portions may be fused or bonded together to form an hermetic seal, the fusion or bond being sufficiently weak to be ruptured by the shock wave. Instead the deformed wall portions may merely touch one another or may be spaced slightly apart to define an aperture which is substantially smaller than the cross sectional area of the casing.

## Description
LOW ENERGY FUSES This invention relates to low energy ruses Further, it relates to methods of manufacturing and modifying a low energy fuse and to apparatus for manufacturing and modifying the fuses This specification is particularly directed to low energy fuses consisting of an elongate casing in the form of a tubular, rigid or flexible conductor, which contains a quantity of explosive an dj or reactive substance distributed along the conductor, which fills up only part of the cross section of the conductor. The rest of the conductor i filled with gas.An embodiment of such a fuse is known by the name Nonel . However, the invention can also be applied to other low energy fuses which may, for example, have completely filled explosive cores or other forms of gas channels. According to the invention there is provided a low energy fuse which includes an elongate tubular casing that has a valve formation which defines a valve that is normally substantially closed and which is opened, in use, by a shock wa e. Further according to the invention there is provided a method of modifying a low energy fuse which includes a length of an elongate tubular casing, which includes deforming a wall portion of the casing to form a valve formation which defines a valve that is normally substantially closed and which is opened, in use, by a shock wave. Further according to the invetion there is provided a method of manufacturing a low energy fuse which includes providing a length of elongate tubular casing and deforming wall portions of the casing to form a valve formation which is normally substantially closed and which is opened, in use, by a shock wave. Further according to the invention there is provided an apparatus for manufacturing a low energy fuse from a length of an elongate tubular casing which includes a deforming means for deforming a wall portion of the casing to form a valve that is normally substantially closed and which is opened, in use, by a shock wave. Further according to the invention there is provided an apparatus for modifying a low energy fuse that includes a length of an elongate tubular casing, which includes a deforming means for deforming a wall portion of the casing to form a valve that is normally substantially closed and which is opened, in use, by a shock wave. The valve formation may be formed from material of the casing and may be such that it closes after the shock wave has passed. The valve formation may further define a construction. In a preferred embodiment, the casing may be of a thermo plasticmaterial. The valve formation may then be formed by heating that portion of the casing where the valve is desired to be and deforming it to form the valve formation. It will be appreciated that the valve formation may be located at an end of the casing or at any position intermediate its ends. The fuse may be manufactured by deforming the casing close to an end, or intermediate its ends, to define two sections, and parting the sections at the place of deformation, one section then being used to form the fuse, the valve then being at an end thereof. It will be understood that opposed sides of the casing may be relatively displaced towards one another.Thus, opposed regions may both be displaced inwardly or one side may be displaced beyond a central axis towards the other side. Further, the valve formation may have any suitable profile. Thus, with a valve formation occurring at an end of the casing it may define a straight edge which extends from one side of the casing to the other. This straight edge may be at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the casing or it may be straight across. The valve formation may alaso have two straight edges which intersect one another at a suitable angle such that the casing has a pointed appearance.The angle between these straight edges may vary and the relative lengths of these straight edges may varyInstead, the valve formation may define a curved edge. It will be appreciated still further that the valve formation may be formed by having two relatively displaceable heated elements that crimp the casing between them. In effect, with a valve formation that is located at the end of the casing, two inwardly directed lips are formed. The angle of these lips with respect to the longitudinal axis of the casing will depend on the shape and configuration of these forming elements.These lips may accordingly define any suitable angle with the longitudinal axis which may be between 150 and 750. The two lips may bond or fuse with one another to a predetermined extent to ensure that the casing is hermetically sealed. However, this bond or fusion is then sufficiently weak to be ruptured when a shock wave arrives at the valve formation. Instead, the lips may touch one another, or may be spaced slightly apart to define an aperture that is substantially smaller than the cross sectional area of the casing. At positions intermediate the ends of the casing, the valve formation may take the form of a constriction. Thus, wall portions of the casing maybe inwardly deformed to provide a relatively small opening or to close off the casing. The invention is now described, by way of examples, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows part of a detonator assembly which includes a low energy fuse in accordance with the invention Figure 2 shows a plan view of a valve formation located at an end of a length of tubing forming the fuse Figure 3 shows a side view of the end of the tubing shown in Figure 2 Figure 4 shows an end view of the tubing of Figures 2 and 3 Figure 5 shows a plan view of a further valve formation formed at an end of a length of tubing Figure 6 shows a plan view of a still further embodiment of a valve formation formed at an end of a length of tubing Figure 7 shows a side view of a still further embodiment of a valve formation formed at an end of a length of tubing Figure 8 shows a plan view of a still further embodiment of a valve formation formed at an end of a length of tubing Figure 9 shows a plan view of a valve formation formed intermediate the ends of a length of tubing Figure 10 shows a sectional view of the valve formation shown in Figure 9 Figure 11 shows schematically a prototype apparatus utilised to form a valve formation at the end of a length of tubing and Figure 12 shows schematically part of a further prototype apparatus utilised to form the valve formation shown in Figures 9 and 10. Referring to Figure 1, shown therein is part of a detonator assembly, which is designated generally by reference numeral 10. The detonator assembly 10 is formed from a length of Nonel fuse 12 and a detonator 14.The Nonel fuse 12 has an end 16 which is located within the detonator 14. A valve formation 18 is formed at this end 1G. The Nonel fuse has a number of other valve formations 20 intermediate its ends. One of these valve formations 20 is shown. The Nonel fuse 12 comprises a length of hollow tubing 22 which is made of a synthetic plastics material known as Surlyn . The tubing 22 contains a quantity of explosive which is distributed along its length. This explosive is not shown in the drawings. Referring now to Figures 2, 3 and 4, the valve formation 18 is shown in more detail. Thus, as is clearly seen in Figures 2, 3 and 4 the tubing 22 has a wall 24 and end regions 26 are deformed towards one another to define a straight edge 28 which extends across the end oe the tubing 22 and is perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the tubing 22. Further, peripheral portions of the end regions 26 are fused or bonded together such that the interior of the tubing 22 is hermetically sealed. However, the fusion or bond is safficiently weak that when a shock wave reaches the end of the tubing the end regions 26 are forced apart allowing the shock wave to pass into the detonator 14. Once the shock wave has passed, the end regions 26 return to their original position thereby sealing the detonator and maintaining pressure within the detonator.As pressure is maintained within the detonator 14, failures due to venting of the detonator are minimised and more consistent delay times are provided. Protection is provided against sparks between the end of the tubing and a sealer elementplaced in the detonator casing. It will be appreciated that the end regions could merely touch one another or be spaced slightly apart. Figures 5, C, 7 and 8 show further embodiments of vale formations. As these valve formations are substantially similar to the valve formation 18 shown inFigures 2 3 and 4, except that they have slightly different shapes and configurations, they will not be discussed in detail. However, the valve formation shown in Figure 5 has a straight edge 30 which extends at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the tubing 22 the valve formation shown in Figure 6 has two straight edges 32 that define an acute angle between themselves such that the end of the tubing 22 has a pointed appearance the valve formation shown in Figure 7 has a bent over lip portion 34 and the valve formation shown in Figure 8 has a curved edge 35. Referring now to Figures 9 and 10, the valve formation 20 is shown. The valve formation 20 comprises a constriction in the tubing 22 formed by making four pyramidal indentations 36. These indentations 36 may meet such that the tubing 22 is completely closed off or may come close to one another such that the tubing 22 is substantially closed. Referring now to Figure 11, shown therein b reference numeral 40 is a prototype apparatus for forming the valve formation 18. Thus, the apparatus 40 has retaining elements 42 which define a seating groove 44 in which the tubing 22 is located. Two opposed forming elements 46 are located on opposite sides of the elements 42 and are pivotally mounted to be displaceable towards the elements 42. The deforming elements 4G are heated such that upon contact thereof with the tubing 22 the tubing 22 is heated to a temperature above the softening point temperature of the Surlyn to deform the tubing 22 and form the valve formation 18. Preferably, the apparatus 40 forms the valve formation 18, cuts the tubing 22 at the valve formation and forms a heat seal on the other side of the cut. Referring to Figure 12, a further apparatus 50 is shown for forming the valve formation 20. The apparatus 50 has four deforming pins 52 that are disposed at 900 to one another in a plane such that the tubing 22 is receivable in the area between opposed tips 54 of the pins 52. The tips 54 are pyramidal or conical. The pins 52 are further mounted to be displaceable together towards one another by a suitable mechanism not shown .The tips 54 of the pins 52 are heated such that upon engagement thereof with the tubing 22 the tubing is heated and deformed. It will be appreciated that the valve formations 20 have the effect of minimising powder migration within the tubing 22, provide an inbuilt delay by reducing the speed oi the shock wave and may provide initiation points for secondary lines of Nonel fuses.
