# MOIRE SIMULATOR

## Abstract
A moire simulator comprises a transparent flat plate bearing a pattern M composed of grating patters having equal grating constants and equal grating shapes, the plate being provided with means S , such as an angle scale, for the measurement of in plane rotation of the plate. In use, the moire simulator is superposed on an original and rotated thereon to a rotation angle with respect to the original at which the extent of moire pattern generation is the lowest. The rotation angle is read off using the angle scale and used to calculate the screen setting angle with will minimize moire pattern generation in the subsequent screening process.
