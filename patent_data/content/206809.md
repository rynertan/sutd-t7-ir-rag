# Lubricant supply rail.

## Abstract
A lubricant supply rail 2 for providing an adequate supply of lubricant from the lubrication circuit of an IC engine to bearing surfaces of the rocker arms, valves 8 and 10 and push rods, is configurated to provide automatic fluid communication between the cylinder head lubricant outlet port 26 and lubrication channels contained within the rocker arm support assemblies 6 and includes a lubricant supply inlet which communicates directly with the cylinder head 4 and a plu rality of transfer bores 54 spaced to communicate directly with each rocker arm support assembly 6 . The lubricant supply rail 2 is formed of nylon and includes a conduit portion sealed at each end by caps configured to seal the conduit by ultrasonic welding. The conduit portion has a cross sectional configuration which permits the rail 2 to be held in sealing engagement with the rocker arm pedestal base 18 .
