## Description
DRILLING FLUID The invention relates to a drilling fluid comprising a at least one polymeric viscosifier b at least one polymeric fluid loss reducer c at least one high molecular weight organic polycationic polymeric coagulant and or flocculant. In this application by a high molecular weight is meant a molecular weight in the range from 500,000 to 15,000,000. When drilling subterranean wells such as, for example, oil or gas wells, the rotary drilling method is commonly employed.The rotary drilling method utilizes a bit attached to a drill stem, and a drilling fluid or mud which is circulated through the drill stem to the bottom of the borehole where it is ejected through small openings in the drill bit. The fluid is then returned to the surface through the annular space between the drill stem and the borehole wall, or casing if one has been installed. Upon reaching the surface, the drilling fluid or mud is ordinarily treated to remove cuttings obtained from the borehole, and is then recirculated. Drilling fluids serve many functions, and should therefore possess a number of desirable physical and rheological properties. For example, the viscosity of a drilling fluid should be sufficient to permit it to effectively transport bit cuttings from the bottom of the borehole to the surface for removal. A drilling fluid should also prevent excessive amounts of fluid from flowing from the borehole into surrounding formations by depositing on the wall of the hole a thin but substantially impervious filter cake. In addition, a drilling fluid should be able to bold solids in suspension, preventing their return to the bottom of the hole when the circulation is reduced or temporarily interrupted.This property can be obtained by utilizing additives which will impart a gel structure to the drilling fluid to increase viscosities. The gel structure, however, is preferably such that cuttings can be removed from the drilling fluid by passing the fluid through filtration equipment such as a shale shaker and or sand cyclones prior to recirculating the fluid to the drill bit. A drilling fluid must also exert pressure on the surrounding formations, thus prevent ting possible collapse of the borehole or influx of highly pressurized oil or gas in the formation. Finally, a drilling fluid should serve as a lubricating and cooling agent for the drill string and the bit. Drilling of easily dispersible formations such as shales, marls and chalks often presents a problem in mud solids control.Drilled solids disintegrate in the drilling fluid while being transported to surface and the fines thus created are. very difficult to rema√ße. A build up of fines is the consequence and leads to an increased viscosity of the drilling fluid and a decreased rate of penetration of the drilling operation. Ultimately mud dilution is required to recondition the mud or drilling fluid. Accepted methods to combat drilled solids disintegration are the application of encapsulating polymers and or inhibiting salts. These chemicals partially prevent disintegration of cuttings and so delay the build up of fines. In easily dispersible formations however, mud dilution will be unevitable in the end. Instead of, or in addition to preventing drilled solids disintegration, aggregation of fines could well be beneficial to solids rem w al. An objective of the present invention is to assess the possibilities of flocculants for the iitprovement of solids removal from drilling fluids. In particular the removal of flocculated shale fines over sieves is an object of the present invention. Application of coagulants and or flocculants serve the purpose of destabilizing a suspension. Discrete aggregates are formed, that are easier to separate from the fluid by settling, sieving, filtration, flotation, centrifugation or other separation methods. The terms flocculation and coagulation are defined as follows. Coagulation is used for the aggregation process, brought about primarily by a reduction of the repulsive potential of the electrical double layer of shale particles. Flocculation is used for the formation of a random loose floc structure, usually brought about by high molecular weight polymers. It should be noted that sate polyelectrolytes act both as a coagulant and a flocculant. The use of ferri and aluminium salts as coagulants is known and widely applied. High molecular weight polyelectrolytes however have proven to be more efficient in many applications. The choice of a coagulant and or flocculant for imprcvement of a certain separation process depends on 1 the type of separation 2 type and 3 concentration of suspended solids and 4 the nature composition of the suspending fluid. Especially in case of polyelectrolytes, it is very difficult to base such a choise on general theoretical considerations. Solidlliquid separation with the aid of coagulants and or flocculants is a ccmmon process in many industries, e.g. waste water treatment, water clarification, mineral ore separation, paper making, oil water separation ... etc ... The characteristic demands of drilling fluids are the following i Selectivity Often, drilling fluids contain two types of solids those added on purpose for increasing viscosity, fluid loss reduction and density improvement, and formation solids, produced while drilling. The organic polycationic polymeric flocculant or coagulant applied according to the invention enhances the removal of drilled solids, but does not interact with soluble mud additive s . ii Compatibility Soluble mud additives and flocculants and or coagulants should be fully compatible. The flocculating properties should not be affected by mud additives and rheological and fluid loss properties not by the flocculant and or coagulant. In the present formulation comprising high molecular weight polycationic polymers, such antagonistic interaction does not exist. i Floc stIx3xEh size Flocs are formed either donhole, where fines are created, if the flocculant is an intrinsic cxnfx3nent of the fluid, or in the flowline if the flocculant is added there at a balanced rate. In both cases a certain amount of viscous shear is exerted on the flocs. Further mechanical shear takes place on sieves shale shakers being used for regenerating the circulating drilling fluid. Flocculant application is only successful if the flocs stay reasonably in tact during the transport and separation process. Another important parameter is floc size. If only very small flocs are formed, a gelly like substance is developed, plugging off the sieves. The present high molecular weight organic polycationic polymeric flocculant is able to create reasonably strong and big flocs, being several millimetres in diameter. iv Dispersion During drilling of dispersible formations, big cuttings will be produced. A flocculant should not enhance the dispersion of these cuttings and should preferably be compatible with cutting encapsulating polymers, preferably present in the drilling fluid. A combination of cutting encapsulation and fines aggregation would of course give the optimal drilling fluid for easily dispersing formations. Also erosion and or swelling of the borehole wall should not be enhanced by a flocculant or a coagulant. The e present high molecular weight cationic polymers meet these requirements. In principle the polycationic flocculants can be used for aggregation of many types of fine suspended solids, such as shales, marls and chalks. Traditionally, bentonite or other clay solids have been utilized to increase the viscosity of the drilling fluid. Today however, there is a growing belief that bentonite or clay suspensions have serious limitations as a drilling fluid base.The rheology of bentonite based fluids is such that the hydraulic horsepower delivered to the bit at a given surface pressure is significantly less than with drilling fluids containing certain polymers. The lower viscosity and or solids content of these polymer muds result in a faster bit penetration rate which in turn decreases the drilling costs.Therefore the drilling fluid according to the invention contains at least one polymeric viscosifier including, for example cellulose pounds such as carbayethyl cellulose, cauix ryrethyl cellulose, carboyrethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, alkylhydroxyalkyl celluloses, alkyl celluloses, and alkylcarboxy alkyl celluloses polyacrylamides natural galactomannans such as guar gum, locust bean gum, and gums derived from endosperm seeds starches and various other polysaccharides, such as the heteropolysaccharide obtained from Pseudaronas sp. NCIB 11592, known by its registered trade name Shellflo S.The concentration of the polymeric viscosifier s is preferably in the range from 1 to 50 g polymeric viscosifier per litre of drilling fluid. As mentioned hereinbefore the drilling fluid according to the invention contains at least one polymeric fluid loss reducerSuitable polymeric fluid loss reducers are pregelatinized starch, gums, polyanionic cel lulo sic polymer, sodiumpoly acrylonitr i le, sodiurrarbrmethyl cellulose and sodiumpoly acrylate. Preferably the drilling fluid contains from 1 to 50 g polymeric fluid loss reducer per litre of drilling fluid. Advantageously in the drilling fluid according to the invention at least one encapsulating polymer is present in order to improve the separation of fine drilled solids from the circulating drilling fluid during the drilling operation with the aid of sieves, e.g. the so called shale shakers. Preferably the encapsulating polymer content of the drilling fluid is in the range from 0.1 to 10 g litre. Examples of suitable encapsulating polymers are hydrolyzed polyacrylamide polyanionic cellulose and heterapolysaccharide . A very much preferred encapsulating polymer to be added to the present drilling fluid is a heteropolysaccharide obtained from PsevdkmDnas sp. NCIB 11592, known by its registered trade name Shellflo S. The drilling fluid according to the invention comprises basically a certain class of organic polycationic polymers. The polymers have a molecular weight between 5x105 and 15x10 6 Any suitable method of application can be used in view of this disclosure. The essential feature is contact between the clay particles to be treated and the polymer contaning carrier fluid. A preferred carrier fluid is water or an aqueous media.The water can contain other ingredients which do not substantially interfere with dispersion or dissolution of the polymer in the media. The water carrier may be gelled or thickened for certain applications. Such ingredients or additives can include salts, mineral acids, low molecular weight organic acids, cationic or nonionic surfactants anionic surfactants can be used with a mutual solvent or wetting agents. The organic polycationic polymer should be present in the carrier fluid in a concentration within the range of about 10 to 5000 ppm wt of organic polycationic polymeric coagulant and or flocculant. Lower or higher concentrations can be used but are generally not practical. A preferred aqueous carrier fluid is a saline solution containing about 0 40 salt up to about saturation limits at the applicable temperature. The preferred salt concentration is about 2 12 by weight however, concentrations up to about 35 can be used, as well as fresh water. The salt can be an alkali metal salt, alkaline earth metal salt, ammonium salt or cati nations thereof. These include the halides, sulphates, carbonates, oxides or catinations thereof. The halides of potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, zinc and combinations thereof are preferred due to economics and solubility.Conventional additives such as inhibitors, surfactants, coupling agents, wetting agents and others can be used where desirable and especially where the organic polycationic polymer is used with conventional treatment procedures. The drilling fluid preferably contains salts or acids which will shrink or prevent swelling. When oil and gas wells are cased, it is necessary to perforate the casing or to drill out a section of open hole below the casing in order to complete the well and start production. A hazard in this well completion operation is that the fluid in the well bore will damage the permeability because it often rushes into the formation when it is opened up. The well can be completed as an open hole, or by perforating using shaped charges or bullets. As a component in the completion fluid, organic polycationic polymers have a purpose of preventing damage to permeability should pressure in the well be higher than formation pressure and the well fluids enter the formation. The organic polycationic polymers present in the drilling fluid according to this invention can generally be considered quaternary polymers with nitrogen or phosphorous as the quaternary or cationic atom with an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic chain. Trivalent or tertiary sulphur can substitute for the quaternary nitrogen or phosphorous in the polymers. The cationic atom to carbon atom ratio is preferably about 1 2 to 1 36 and the molecular weight is above about 1,000. Exartples of these polycationic polymers include polyethyleneamines, polyvinylpyridinium salts, or polyallylamronium salts. Preferred organic polycationic polymers of this invention can be characterized and illustrated by the following formula and examples.

These examples show branching through at least one organic radical such as examples 1 , 2 , 3d , 3e , 3f , 3g , 3h and 3i and through a cation radical such as example 3a . Also examples 3d , 3e , 3f , 3g , 3h and 3i can be considered to have branching through pent cation radicals or hetero groups. The drilling fluid according to the invention can also be used as completion fluid or workover fluid. The following example serves to illustrate various eboodi ments of the invention and enable one skilled in the art to practice this invention. EXAMPLE A number of flocculants were tested in various concentrations, in solutions of viscosifiers and fluid loss reducers.Qualitative tests were carried aut in measuring cyclinders, noting occurrence of flocculation and type of floc settling of the flocs turbidity of the supernatant. The results of these tests were used for primary screening of flocculants. The best performing flocculants were used for further testing. Suspensions were flocculated and moderately sheared by hot rolling or peddle stirring for two hours. Subsequently the flocs were sieved off and dried, and the recovery determined. Tests were done in solutions of single additives and mixed solutions of viscosifiers and fluid loss reducers. The effect of flocculant and shale fines concentration was extensively evaluated in Shellflo S solutions Shellflo S is a registered trade mark . A number of tests was carried out to compare the effect of flocculants in fresh water and KCl, NaCl and CaCl2 solutions, containing Shellflo S. The combined effect of encapsulating and flocculating polymers was investigated in suspensions of shale fines and cuttings. In all tests dispersed, flocculated or encapsulated shale was renewed from the suspension over either 150 or 180 wm sieves and the fraction retained on the sieves was determined. In the flocculant depletion tests, the thus obtained filtrate was again used as flocculating mud. The shale used in all tests, either as fines or cuttings, is Pierre shale, an outcrop material from Utah U.S.A. . Table 1 shows the composition of this shale. Table 2 sumnarises all flocculants used with suppliers and, if known, a description of their chemical nature. In Table 3, a summary is given of all mud additives used, again also mentioning suppliers and chemical compositions. Table 4 shows the results of tests on the compatibility of flocculants and coagulants, with mud additives. Incompatibility precipitation with sate of the mud additives is considered to be too risky for a chemical to be incorporated in drilling fluids that will be used on a routine basis. Table 5 gives the results of measuring cylinder flocculation tests. It shows which mud additive flocculant combinations are able to flocculate a Pierre shale suspension and which are not. The anionic flocculant SS 100 hydrolysed polyacrylamide shows a poor performance. From Table 5 can be concluded that the cationic XZ 86243 performs very well. Table 6 shows the recovery of Pierre shale fines over 100 mesh sieves. The main conclusion from these results is that a significant improvement in solids removal can be attained by addition of a cationic high molecular weight flocculant. Table 7 shows the results of flocculation tests in various fluids. Since it was known in this stage that anionic polymers perform poorly, they were excluded from this test series. More cationic polymers were included instead. The presence of salts alone, did not cause flocculation.The main conclusions are The low MW 50,000 and medium 50,000 MW 500,000 molecular weight flocculants C 581, P.P.C. show a poor performance in all solutions. High molecular weight 5x105 15x106 is clearly required for effective solids removal improvemant. The nalco flocculants 4625, 4725 and 4780, although used in combination with an activator are ineffective in fresh water but perform well to excellent in brines. For use in drilling operations XZ 86243 is preferred for fresh water systems Nalco 4625 and 4780 and perhaps others from this product series for brines and C 420 for both. Table 8 shows the effect of the flocculant concentration on solids removal for C 420, XZ 86243 and Nalco 4625. C 420 is effective, in the whole range from 10 to 1000 ppm wt XZ 86243 shows increasing performance with increasing concentration. The water content of the retained fines clearly increases with flocculant concentration for the two effective products. This information is of particular relevance for solid waste disposal. Variation of the fines content from 0.1 to 5.0 w v had no effect on recoveries. Addition of 500 ppm C 420 and XZ 86243 toShellflo S Pierre shale suspensions always resulted in a recovery between 90 and 100 . In most tests viscosities of solutions with and without flocculant were measured and also the viscosity of the filtrate.Addition of up to 500 ppm flocculant always caused a slight change in rheology, but never more than approximately 5 . The viscosity of the filtrates was generally lower than that of the initial mud, but always within a range of approximately 10 .Taking the high solids load and normal adsorption of polymeric mud additives into account, this value is according to expectation. Table 9 shows the results of combined application of cutting encapsulators and flocculants on fines and cutting recovery. Clearly no antagonistic effect occurs between the two.Again XZ 86243 shows to be a very effective flocculant andShellflo S and SS 100 excellent cutting inhibitors. Table 10 shows the results of the triaxial shale tests c.f.Darley, H.C.H., MA Laboratory Investigation of BoreholeStability J. Pat. Tech., July 1969, 883 893 AIME, 246. The cationic flocculant XZ 86243 is clearly shown to be inert as far as borehole stability is concerned.
