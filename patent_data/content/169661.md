# Apparatus for rebuilding worn shoe grouser for track chain.

## Abstract
The shoe 30 has a grouser 31 which has worn down and has been cut off preparatory to welding a new lug 32 to the stump. The lug 32 is held in a groove 5 in a holder 4 whose shaft 3 is rotatable in a hole 7 in a frame 1a. The shoe 30 is pressed into engagement with the lug 32 by a cylinder 12 acting on a shoe holder 9. The holder 9 and cylinder 12 are carried by a shaft 11 which is rotatable in a hole 10 in frame member 1b. A welding gun is carried along above the junction 33 to weld one side and then the whole assembly is rotated to present the other side of the seam to the welding gun. Additional shoes and lugs may be clamped in a series arrangement between the cylinder 12 and the holder 4.
