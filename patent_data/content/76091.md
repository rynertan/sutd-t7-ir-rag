# MAGNETIC RECORDING AND OR REPRODUCING APPARATUS

## Abstract
In a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus of 2 head helical scan type, an overlapping portion is formed at one end of each video track on a magnetic tape, and a PCM audio signal is recorded on this overlapping portion. Video audio selective switching circuits 24, 25 are disposed on the input or output side of video and audio recording amplifiers 26, 27 , and video audio selective switching circuits 24, 25 and video audio playback equalizer circuits 18, 20 are disposed on the output side of video and audio playback amplifiers. Each of the heads acts as both of a video head and an audio head.
