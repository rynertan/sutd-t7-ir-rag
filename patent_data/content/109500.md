Suitable basic salts include alkali and alkaline earth metal salts such lithium, sodium, potsssium, magnesium and calcium and iron, as well as ammonium and quarternary ammonium salts. It is to be understood that the compounds of the present invention may have one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and the various racemic mixtures as well as the individual optically active compounds are considered to be within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of this invention can be prepared by condensation under dehydrating and reducing conditions of a hydrazine compound of the formula EMI6.1 with an alpha keto acid derivative of the formula EMI6.2 to form compounds in which R2 and X are hydrogen or condensing compounds of formula II with an alpha haloacid derivative of the formula EMI6.3 under conditions for removal of hydrogen halide. Additionally, the present compounds can be prepared by acylating a hydrazine compound of the formula EMI7.1 with a halogen compound of the formula EMI7.2 under conditions for removal of hydrogen halide. Alternatively, the compounds of this invention can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding azo compound to provide products in which X and Y are hydrogen. Compounds of structures II IV can be prepared by art recognized procedures. For example, compounds of structure VI by reaction of phosgene with compounds of the following formula EMI8.1 Compounds of structure III include known compounds as do compounds of structure IV. The foregoing reactions are carried out in organic solvents such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, lower alkanols, acetic acid, methylene chloride, ethylene chloride and similar such solvents. Most reactions occur readily at room temperature and some preferably at lower than room temperature, down to OOC. As with many organic chemical reactions, the use of higher temperatures usually results in shorter reaction times. Thus, even where initial reactions are conveniently conducted at room temperature or lower temperature, the use of higher temperatures after the initial reaction subsides where exothermic, can increase the yields of product obtained. Conveniently, reaction mixtures can be digested at reflux temperature of the mixture. In those reactions where hydrogen halide is formed, it is preferred to employ hydrogen halide acceptors as is well known in this art. In the present processes, any of the usual hydrogen halide acceptors can be employed, e.g.triethylamine, picolines, pyridine and other tertiary organic amines. As well as varous inorganic bases such as metal carbonates and bicarbonates e.g. NaHC03,CaC03 and K2C03. The aforesaid condensation, dehydration and reducing conditions for reaction of compounds of structureII with those of structure III can be conveniently accomplished in the same reactor as a combined reaction of in separate stages. The condensation and dehydration steps result in a compound of the formula EMI9.1 which is then reduced to the corresponding dihydro compound of formula I. The dehydration reaction can be conducted using standard dehydrating agents such as dehydrating silica gels, acids such as toluenesulfonic acid, solvents which form azeotropes with water, such as benzene and toluene, and similar dehydrating agents. The condensation and dehydration step are normally simultaneously effected, generally in a solvent such as those mentioned hereinbefore, conveniently at room temperature, although temperatures from 0 reflux temperature, of the mixtuer can be used. Of course, when an azeotropic removal of water is accomplished using a suitable solvent, reflux temperature is used and water is removed by a suitable trap e.g. Dean Stark apparatus. The reduction reaction can be accomplished without isolation of the dehydration product by addition of a suitable reducing either after the dehydration or simultaneous with the dehydrating agent. Suitable reducing include, of course, noble metal catalysts with hydrogen gas, usually at room temperature and moderate pressures of hydrogen gas, or chemical reducing agents such as metals and mineral acids, e.g. zine and hydrochlorine acid, or metal hydrides such as borohydrides or aluminohydrides, e.g.sodium cyanoborohydride. After the desired reaction step is accomplished the final product is recovered by usual methods from the reaction mixtures in which produced and thereafter purified e.g. by chromatography such as column chromatography or gas liquid chromatography, or by recrystallisation from suitable solvents. Various substituents on the present new compounds, e.g., as defined for R1, can be present in the starting compounds or added after formation of the products by the known methods of substitution or conversion reactions.Thus, the nitro group can be added to the final product by nitration of the aromatic ring and the nitro group converted to other groups, such as amino by reduction, and halo by diazotization of the amino group and replacement of the diazo group. Other reactions can be effected on the formed product. Amino groups can be effected on the formed product. Amino groups can be alkylated to form mono and dialkylamino groups, mercapto and hydroxy groups can be alkylated to form corresponding ethers. Thus, substitution or alteration reactions can be employed to provide a variety of substituents throughout the molecule of the final products. Of course, reactive groups where present should be protected by suitable blocking groups during any of the aforesaid reactions particularly the condensation reactions. The acid and base salts of the present new compounds can be formed using standard procedures. Often they are formed in situ during the preparation of the present new compounds. The present compounds obviously exist in stereoisomeric forms and the products obtained thus can be mixtures of the isomers, which can be resolved.Alternativley, by selection of specific isomers as starting compounds, the preferred stereoisomer can be produced.Therefore, the preferred forms, where each asymmetric center chairal center is S configuration, are preferably prepared by the stereospecific route rather than attempting resolution of mixtures of isomers. The compounds in which the S configuration exists at all asymmetric centers are the most active those in which the R configuration exists are of less activity and those where both R andS configuration exist are of intermediate activity.

After work up, the crude product was purified to give 0.55 g of pure product, alpha D 30.N l methyl 2 ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl hydrazino carbonylproline s,S The t butyl ester 0.37 g in 100 ml of ether was treated with hydrogen chloride at 0 C for 3 hours. Evaporation of solvent gave the desired compound as hydrogen chloride salt, alpha D 19.4. Compounds of this invention demonstrate potent activity e.g. of the order of I50 of 100 micromols in inhibiting the angiotensin converting enzyme ACEI activity when tested by the method described in Science 196, 441 4 1977 They also demonstrated an I50 of about 3 mg kg p.o.in inhibiting infused angiotensin I in rats. As such, these would be very useful in the treatment of hypertension. The compounds may be administered orally or parenterally in the treatment of hypertensions and it is within the professional judgment and skill of the practitioner to determine the amount to be administered.Suitable dosage forms include tablets, capsules, elixirs and injectables.
