# Improved method of increasing the accessibility of cellulosic material in lignocellulosic materials.

## Abstract
The invention comprises a method for increasing the accessibility of cellulose in lignocellulosic materials to chemical or biochemical reagents. The material is steam cooked for a predetermined time, then rapidly depressurized. A venting sequence is used to remove volatiles from the reactor. Optimal cooking times for normal and acid catalyzed cooking are disclosed, according to the discovery of a novel set of governing equations, wherein optimum cooking times can be determined as a time integration of reactor pressure.
