## Description
SLIDE FASTENER ASSEMBLY The present invention relates to a slide fastener assembly having a net joining structure for use in joining together a pair of confronting edges of net structure. A typical example of the net joining structures of the type described is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,056,868 patented on November 8, 1977. The known structure includes a pair of warp knitted net adapters each having a net transition region arranged for connection to one of the confronting edges of a net structure and a pair of web regions disposed at a common side of the net transition region and jointly supporting one of the stringers of a slide fastener.The net transition region comprises a mesh structure having a number of diamond shaped meshes therein.The mesh structure includes adjoining regions of different mesh size arranged such that the smallest mesh size region adjoins one of said web regions and the largest mesh size region is that for connection to the edge of the net structure. The web region is composed of the warp chains of the net transition region extending transversely thereinto, and weft thread laid in the warp chains to fasten them together. Each of the stringers is sandwiched by the web regions and sewn thereto by sewing stitches. The net joining structure thus arranged has been found unsatisfactory in that the slide fastener stringers are likely to become wavy, puckered or otherwise deformed, because the diamond shaped meshes vary in shape or deform when severe lateral tension is applied to the net structure. The stringers thus deformed hinder smooth sliding movement of a slider along rows of coupling elements secured to confronting edges of the stringers, and cause the rows of coupling elements to split open away from each other.Furthermore, the sewing stitches extending on and across the web regions are in danger of becoming frayed or sometimes broken upon abrasive contact with rigid foreign matter. The known adapter having such knit structure is not suitable for continuous production on a warp knitting machine. According to the present invention, there is provided a slide fastener assembly for joining together a pair of confronting edges of net structure, comprising a slide fastener having a pair of stringers and a pair of warp knitted net adapters having a number of meshes therein, each of the adapters including a net transition region arranged for connection to one of the confronting edges of the net structure, and a pair of superimposed web regions connected to a longitudinal edge of the net transition region and jointly supporting one of the stringers, said net transition region having a first portion disposed remotely from the longitudinal edge, at least one second portion extending adjacent to the web regions, and at least one third portion extending between the first and the second portions, the web regions having a mesh size smaller than that of the first, second and third portions, characterized in that said meshes in said warp knitted net adapters are in the shape of a rectangle, and that said third portion has a mesh size larger than that of said first and second portions. It is an object of the present invention to provide a slide fastener assembly including a pair of warp knitted adapters having a structure strong enough to withstand severe external stresses applied thereto either in the longitudinal or in the transverse direction thereof, without deforming or otherwise damaging a slide fastener attached to the adapters. Another object of the present invention is to provide a slide fastener assembly having an adapter which is connectable to one of the confronting edges of a net structure with utmost ease. The present invention will become manifest to those versed in the art upon making reference to the detailed description and the accompanying drawings in which certain preferred embodiments incorporating the principles of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example.

As shown in FIG. 1, a slide fastener assembly 15 for joining together a pair of confronting edges of net structure comprises a pair of warp knitted net adapters 18, 18 hereinafter referred to as adapters having a number of rectangular openings or meshes. Each of the adapters18, 18 includes a net transition region 19 arranged for connection to one of the confronting edges of the net structure, and a pair of superimposed web regions 20, 20 connected to a longitudinal edge of the net transition region 19 and jointly supporting one of the stringers 21 of a slide fastener 22. One such net structure 17 having a confronting edge 16 is shown inFIG. 7. As shown in FIG. 1, the net transition region 19 has a first portion 23 not including a core thread 46 extending along the opposite edge thereof remote from the slide fastener stringer 21. The net transition region 19 is folded over on itself and is shown in FIG.3 in an unfolded manner whereby the first portion 23 appears centrally. The region 19 further includes a pair of second portions 24, 24 extending adjacent to the web regions 20, 20, respectively, and a pair of third portions 25, 25 extending respectively between the first portion 23 and the second portions 24, 24.The third portions 25, 25 have a mesh size larger than that of the first and second portions 23, 24, 24. The first and second portions 23, 24, 24 have substantially a uniform mesh size. The net transition region 19 is composed of a plurality of warp cords 26 31 extending longitudinally thereof and a plurality of weft threads 32 which, as described below in connection with FIG. 5, have longitudinal portions extending longitudinally of the warp cords 26 31 and transverse portions extending in pairs perpendicularly to and between the warp cords 26 31 to jointly define therebetween the meshes of the aforesaid sizes.The web regions 20, 20 are composed of a plurality of warp cords 33 36 extending longitudinally thereof in parallel relation to the warp cords 26 31 and a plurality of weft threads 37 extending substantially in parllel to the weft threads 32 to jointly define therebetween meshes much smaller than those of the net transition region 19. The weft threads 37 are thinner than the weft threads 32. As shown in FIG. 5, the warp cords 26 31 of the net transition region 19 include warp threads L1 knitted in pairs as chain stitches and longitudinal portions of a plurality of weft laid in threads L2 L5 knitted with the chain stitches L1. Transverse portions of the respective weft laid in threads L2 L5 extend in pairs between the warp cords 26 31 and jointly constitute the weft threads 32 of the transition region 19. The warp cords 33 35 of the web regions 20, 20 also include warp threads L1 knitted in pairs as chain stitches and longitudinal portions of a plurality of weft laid in threads L8, L9 knitted with the chain stitches L1. The weft threads 37 of the web regions 20, 20 are constituted by transverse portions of the weft laid in threads L8, L9, respectively.Although not shown in FIG. 5, a plurality of threadsL6, only one of which is shown in FIG. 6, is laid warpwise in the warp cords 27 31, 33 36, respectively, and a plurality of warp threads L7, only one of which is shown in FIG. 6, is also laid warpwise in the warp cords 26 30, 33 36. The threads L6, L7 have patterns symmetrical with each other as shown in FIG. 6 whereby they cooperate together in tightly binding together the respective pairs of the warp threads L1 of the warp cords 26 31, 33 36. As shown in FIG. 6, the threads Ll L9 have respective patterns as follows Thread Pattern L1 0 1 1 0. L2 5 5 3 3 5 5 3 3 5 5 3 3 5 5 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0.

As best shown in FIG. 4, the adapter 18 thus knitted has the warp cords 26 31, 33 36 thicker than the weft threads 32, 37 so that a pair of longitudinal grooves 38, 38 is defined between every adjacent pair of warp cords 26 31, 33 36 at the opposite sides of the adapter 18. The threads L1, L6, L7 may comprise multifilament yarns made of polyester and the threadsL2, L3, L4, L5, L8 may comprise twisted yarns made of polyester. Each thread L9 serves as a connecting thread for connecting two adjacent adapters 18 along their confronting edges, thereby enabling the production of a plurality of laterally connected adapters simultaneously. The connecting threads L9 are made preferably of water soluble synthetic resin fibers, so that the adapters 18 can be separated by being dipped into water after having been knitted. The adapter 18 can be produced easily on a warpknitting machine not shown in a substantially endless, continuous length which may be severed into pieces of desired lengths by a hot cutting blade or another suitable cutting means not shown . The cut ends of the respective adapter pieces are prevented from fraying by fusion together of the synthetic resin yarn ends. As the warp cords 26 31, 33 36 are composed of the warp threads L1 knitted in pairs as chain stitches and the longitudinal portions of the weft laid in threads L2 L5, L8, L9 knitted with the chain stitches, the adapter 18 is made per se stable in structure and rigid in construction. The adapters 18, 18 are then attached respectively to the stringers 21, 21 of the slide fastener 22 to thereby constitute the slide fastener assembly 15 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. To make the attachment, each adapter 18 is folded overon itself about the first portion 23 of the net transition region 19 with the reinforcing core thread 46 being held firmly by and between the warp cords 28, 29 of the first portion 23. Each stringer 21 is sandwiched between the web regions 20, 20 of the adapter 18 and then is sewn to the same by two pairs of rows of sewing stitches 44a, 44b, such as lock stitches or double chain stitches, each pair of rows of sewing 44a, 44b extending in and along one longitudinal groove 38, which is devoid of warp cords, across the weft threads 37 of each web region 20.In order to increase the binding strength of the sewing stitches 44a, 44b and to distribute such increased binding strength uniformly over the web regions 20, 20, the sewing stitches 44a, 44b are formed by driving a pair of sewing needles not shown through each stringer 21 from opposite sides thereof such that a needle thread of the stitches 44a and a looper thread of the stitches 44b appear in each longitudinal groove 38. The warp cords 26, 31, 33 36 serve, in adjacent pairs, to prevent the sewing stitches 44a, 44b from displacing outside the grooves 38 and from being worn out or damaged upon engagement with rigid foreign matter such as rocks, stones and the like. The warp cords 26, 31, 33 36 further serve to grip the stringers 21, 21 stably in position.At least the sewing stitches 44a, 44b in each groove 38 are covered with a layer of synthetic resin 45, and more preferably the groove 38 is filled with the synthetic resin layer 45, as shown in FIG. 2. With this arrangement, the sewing stitches 44a, 44b are completely protected from any degree of damage, such as loosening, fraying, abrasive wear or the like. The slide fastener 22 shown in FIG. 1 has a pair of rows of coupling elements 39, 39 mounted on and along a pair of confronting edges of the stringers 21, 21, respectively. A pair of top end stops 40, 41 is mounted at the upper end of the slide fastener 22 adjacent to a pair of uppermost ones of the coupling elements 39, 39, respectively. The slide fastener 22 further has a bottom end stop 42 mounted at the lower end thereof transversely across the confronting edges of the stringers 21, 21. A slider 43 is slidably mounted on the rows of coupling elements 39, 39 for bringing them into and out of interdigitating engagement with each other to close and open the slide fastener 22 in a well known manner. As shown in FIG. 7, each adapter 18 of the slide fastener assembly 15 is attached to one of the confronting edges or endmost threads 16 of the net structure 17 by a connecting rope or cord 47. The connecting cord 47 extends successively through the mesh openings in the adapter s third portions 25 and the mesh openings in the net structure s longitudinal edge 16 spirally over and around the warp cords 28, 29, the reinforcing core thread46 and the endmost threads 16 of the net structure 17. The third portions 25 with the meshes of the largest size allow the connecting cord 47 to pass therethrough with utmost ease, with the result that a simple and time saving connection is achieved. With the slide fastener assembly 15 thus constructed, the slide fastener 22 can be protected against deformation or damage under the influence of severe external stresses because such stresses, when applied on the net structure 17 in the transverse direction of the adapters 18, 18, are taken up and distributed uniformly over the entire length of the slide fastener stringers 21, 21 by means of the net transition region 19, 19 having rectangular meshes of varying sizes defined by the thick warp cords 26 31 and the weft thread pairs 32. The warp cords 26 31, 33 36 have a strength enough to withstand severe external stresses applied to the adapters 18, 18 in the longitudinal direction thereof. Furthermore, the web regions 20, 20 having the smallest meshes, and made compact, permit the fastener stringers 21, 21 to be sewn thereto with stability and to a nicety.The adapter s first portion 23, having the thick warp cords 28, 29 and the reinforcing core thread 46 disposed between the warp threads 28, 29, provides a positive connection to each edge 16 of the net structure 17 during a long period of use. FIGS. 8 and 9 show a modified adapter 50 including a net transition region 51 and a pair of web regions 52, 52 disposed at opposite sides of the net transition region 51. The adapter 50 is substantially the same as the adapter 18 of the foregoing embodiment with the exception that the net transition region 51 includes a pair of second portions 53, 53 each having a pair of rows of rectangular meshes of uniform size. Each of the second portions 53 includes three warp cords 54, 55, 56 and 57, 58, 59 extending longitudinally thereof and a plurality of weft threads 60 which, as described below in connection with FIG. 10, have longitudinal portions extending longitudinally of the warp cords 54 56, 57 59 and transverse portions extending in pairs perpendicularly to and between the warp cords 54 56, 57 59 to jointly define therebetween the rectangular meshes.As shown in FIG. 10, the adapter 50 is composed of a plurality of threads L1 L8 each having the same pattern as a corresponding one of the threads L1 L8 shown in FIG. 6. Each of the central warp cords 55, 58 includes two of the threads L1 knitted as chain stitches and longitudinal portions of the threads L2,L3 laid weftwise in the chain stitches Ll. The weft threads 60 are constituted by transverse portions of the weft laid in threads L2, L3 extending in pairs between the warp cords 54 56, 57 59. The threads L6,L7 are laid warpwise in the cord 55, 58 to tightly bind the threads L1, L1 of the chain stitches. The warp cords 54, 56, 57, 59 are structurally the same as a corresponding one of the warp cords 26, 27, 30, 31 of the adapter 18 shown in FIG. 5.The adapter 50 is attached to one of the confronting edges of a net structure not shown after having been assembled with a slide fastener stringer and a reinforcing core thread, in the same manner as described with respect to the foregoing embodiment. The adapter 50 thus arranged is further advantageous in that lateral tension applied to the net structure is taken up more efficiently and distributed more uniformly through the second portions 53, 53 over the length of the slide fastener stringer than in the case of the adapter 18. An adapter shown in FIGS. 11 and 12 has a net transition region 62 and a pair of web regions 63, 63. A first portion 64 of the net transition region 62 has a pair of warp cords 66, 67 between which a reinforcing core thread 65 extends. Differring from the foregoing embodiments, the core thread 65 is held by and between pairs of weft threads 68 extending transversely between the warp cords 66, 67 at longitudinal intervals. Such arrangement is realized by knitting the core thread 65 into the first portion 64 of the adapter 61 as the latter is knitted. The adapter 61 with the core thread 64 knitted therein can be attached to a net structure not shown with utmost ease. FIG. 13 shows a modified slide fastener assembly 70 comprising a pair of adapters 71, 71 each having a net transition region 72 and a pair of web regions 73, 73 disposed at a common edge of the net transition region 72. A slide fastener 74 includes a pair of stringers 75, 75 secured to the adapters 71, 71 by rows of sewing stitches 76 in sandwiched relation to each pair of the web regions 73, 73, respectively. The slide fastener 74 has a pair of rows of coupling elements 77, 77 mounted on the respective stringers 75, 75 along their confronting edges and a separable bottom end stop 78 so that the stringers 75, 75 can be completely separated from each other when a slider not shown is located at the lowermost position adjacent to the separable bottom end stop 78. A pair of core threads 79, 79 reinforces the respective net transition regions 72, 72 arranged for connection to a pair of confronting edges of net structure not shown .
