## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION LIQUID CRYSTAL COMPOUNDS,LIQUID CRYSTAL COMPOSITIONSAND LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY DEVICES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a liquid crystal compound, a liquid crystal composition containing the liquid crystal compound as a component and a liquid crystal display device with the liquid crystal composition sealed therein.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART To obtain liquid crystal display devices having excellent response and wide viewing angle, it is necessary to reduce the viscosity and refractive anisotropy of a liquid crystal material used. For satisfying these requirements, phenylcyclohexane and phenyl cyclohexanecarboxylate liquid crystal materials obtained by introducing a cyclohexane ring into chemical structures of liquid crystal materials have been proposed. However, the phenyl cyclohexanecarboxylate liquid crystal compounds having an ester group between two six membered rings have insufficient physical properties such as viscosity and refractive anisotropy. For example, liquid crystal compounds represented by the general formula EMI1.1 hereinafter referred to as conventional compounds have too high viscosity and refractive anisotropy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a new ester type liquid crystal compound having low viscosity and refractive anisotropy. Another object of the invention is to provide a liquid crystal composition containing said liquid crystal compound as a component and a liquid crystal display device having a liquid crystal layer comprising the liquid crystal composition.The liquid crystal compound of the present invention is characterized by having the following molecular structure a the molecular skeleton has two or more six membered rings, b the respective six membered rings are bonded directly to each other, c a carbon atom in each of the terminal six membered rings is bonded directly to an acyclic terminal group, d one of the acyclic terminal groups bonded to the carbon atom of the six membered ring is an alkyl group or an alkoxycarbonyl free group bonding through an alkylene group, and e the other acyclic terminal group bonded to the carbon atom in the six membered ring has a carbonyl group and a terminal alkoxyl group. The typical liquid crystal compounds of the present invention are represented by the following formula R1 X Y R2 wherein R1 is an alkyl group or a carboxyl free acyclic group directly bonded to X through an alkylene group, R2 is an acyclic group directly bonded to Y and having a carbonyl group and a terminal alkoxyl group, X is a six membered ring selected from the group consisting of phenyl, cyclohexane and bicyclooctane rings and Y is a six membered ring selected from the group consisting of phenyl and cyclohexane rings. Liquid crystal compounds having an ester group as a central linkage as in the conventional compounds namely, compounds in which the six membered rings are not directly bonded to each other inevitably have a high viscosity.After investigations, the inventors have found that the viscosity of the liquid crystal compounds can be reduced by directly bonding the six membered rings to each other. In a liquid crystal compound in which an oxygen atom is directly bonded to a six membered ring such as a benzene ring, s electrons of the benzene ring are conjugated with unshared electrons of the oxygen to become mobilized and thereby increase the dipole moment and dielectric constant.As a result, the viscosity and the refractive anisotropy are increased. After investigations made for the purpose of introducing an ester group into a terminal of said compound to interpose a carbonyl group between the oxygen atom and the benzene ring, the inventors have succeeded in synthesizing an ester type liquid crystal compound having a reduced dipole moment by preventing the electron mobilization. The present invention has been completed on the basis of these findings. Introduction of alkoxycarbonyl groups into the ends of the both terminal acyclic groups gives rise to a smectic liquid crystal having an extremely high viscosity at ambient temperature. Therefore, if an alkoxycarbonyl containing acyclic terminal group is required, such a group must be introduced into only one end of the compound in the present invention. Also in the other acyclic terminal group, the direct bonding of oxygen to the six membered ring is not preferred.Therefore, the acyclic terminal group in the liquid crystalline compound contains an alkyl or alkylene group according to the present invention. The acyclic terminal groups are situated preferably in positions para with respect to the bonding position of the six membered rings. With this arrangement, the liquid crystal molecule has a linear structure and a reduced viscosity. The number of oxygen atoms is preferably 0 or 1 in the acyclic group defined in the above item d and preferably 2 in the acyclic group defined in the above item e , because if more oxygen atoms are present, the viscosity will be increased by the polarity of the oxygen atoms themselves in both cases. The acyclic group as defined in the item d is bonded to a carbon atom in the six membered ring through methylene group s and it may have a terminal alkoxyl group. The acyclic group is represented by, for example, the following formula CH2O CH CH2 xOCyH2y 1 , CH2 xO CH2 zOC H2y 1 or CH2O CH2 xOCyH2y 1 wherein x and z are each an integer of 1 to 4 and y is an integer of 1 to 8. The acyclic group defined in the item e is represented by, for example, the following formula COOR CH2 nCOOR CO CH2 OR or n CH2 mCO CH2 nOR wherein R is an alkyl group and m and n are each an integer of 1 to 8. The number of carbon atoms in the acyclic group is preferably up to 13, since the viscosity is increased as the number of carbon atoms is increased. The number of carbon atoms in the acyclic group as defined in the item d is preferably up to 12 for the same reason as above. The liquid crystal compound of the present invention has at least two six membered rings preferably selected from the group consisting of phenyl, cyclohexane and bicyclooctane rings. The liquid crystal compound of the present invention has a high chemical stability. The liquid crystal compound of the present invention is obtained by, for example, the following process EMI6.1 A compound of the formula EMI6.2 is obtained by a Gringnard reaction ofEMI6.3 The obtained compound is dehydrated to obtain a compound of the formula EMI6.4 which is then hydrogenated to obtain a compound of the formula EMI6.5 This product is acetylated by a Friedel Crafts reaction and the product is recrystallized from a suitable solvent to obtainEMI7.1 The trans isomer of this compound is converted into R1EMI7.2 COOH by a halo form reaction.This compound is esterified with a suitable aliphatic alcohol R20H and sulfuric acid to obtainEMI7.3 are subjected to a Friedel Crafts reaction in the presence of AlCl 3 catalyst to obtain EMI7.4 which is then reduced with hydrazine toEMI7.5 Then, the acetylation, haloform reaction and esterification reaction are effected in the same manner as in item a to obtain R1EMI7.6 EMI7.7 are subjected to a Friedel Crafts reaction to obtainEMI8.1 This compound is subjected to the acetylation, haloform reaction and esterification reaction in the same manner as in item a to obtainEMI8.2 The liquid crystal composition of the present invention comprises the above mentiond liquid crystal compound alone or a mixture thereof with other liquid crystal compounds and it may further contain additives such as a dichroic dye and an optically actie substance. The proportion of the components may be determined without any limitation but the amount of the liquid crystal compound is preferably at least t wt. . A TN display can be realized by using a liquid crystal compound having a positive dielectric anisotropy and a color display can be realized by using a liquid crystal compound having a negative dielectric anisotropy and a dichroic dye. Further, any sort of the display can be realized by suitably selecting additives. A liquid crystal display device of the present invention comprises the liquid crystal composition of the present invention selaed in a liquid crystal cell comprising two opening substrates, a transparent electrode placed on each of the opposing surfaces of the substrates, an insulating and orientation controlling membrane placed on each of the opposing surfaces of the transparent electrodes which membrane acts to arrange adjacent liquid crystal molecules in a given direction on the substrate and a sealing member surrounding the two opposing substrates. As described above in detail, the new estertype liquid crystal compounds of the present invention are effective in reducing the viscosity and refractive anisotropy and, therefore, the liquid crystal compositions containing said compounds are effective in forming liquid crystal display devices having excellent response and wide viewing angle.
