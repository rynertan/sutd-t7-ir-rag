## Description
TWO STAGE PROCESS FOR CONTINUOUS PREPARATION OF POLYPHENYLENE OXIDES This invention relates to the preparation of polyphenylene oxides, and more particularly to a continuous oxidative coupling process for such preparation. For the most part, the present processes for the preparation of polyphenylene oxides also known as polyphenylene ethers are batch processes. Reference is made, for example, to the following U.S. patents 3,306,875 hereinafter 875 3,914,266 hereinafter 266 4,028,341 hereinafter 341 .A problem associated with batch operation is variation from batch to batch in product quality. In addition, continuous processes frequently offer lower capital and operating costs per unit of production than batch processes, especially in large scale production. There have been disclosed various processes possibly adaptable tovcontinuous production of polyphenylene oxides. For example, U.S. Patent 3,306,874 hereinafter 874 and Japanese Kokai 80 21798 published application 80 40613 disclose polymerization processes using three reactors in series. A similar process using two reactors is disclosed in Japanese Kokai 73 45600. Three different kinds of column reactors are disclosed in Japanese Kokai 74 08597,Japanese okai 80 55996 and Czechoslovakian Patent 192,278.These reaction systems suffer from various disadvantages including a relatively high catalyst level and an unduly long residence time in one or more reactors. A principal object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide a continuous process for the preparation of polyphenylene oxides. Another object is to provide such a process which affords improvements over previously disclosed continuous processes, including lower catalyst level and lower overall residence time in the reaction system. Other objects will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter. In its broadest sense, the present invention is an improvement in an oxidative coupling process for preparing polyphenylene oxides by the catalytic reaction of oxygen with at least one monohydroxyaromatic compound, said improvement comprising carrying out said reaction continuously entirely in a continuous flow tubular reactor containing multiple reaction zones, each of which is agitated. The invention, while not limited to any particular theory, is based on a number of discoveries about the nature of the oxidative coupling reaction leading to the polyphenylene oxide. In the first place, said reaction in its later stages is first order with respect to concentration of the hydroxy group. At that point, of course, said concentration is relatively low, since a large proportion of the available hydroxy groups have been converted to ether groups. There fore , the reaction is quite slow in these later stages. In the second place, the oxidative coupling polymerization is essentially an equilibrium reaction. Therefore, if both high molecular weight and low molecular weight polymer are present a leveling effect occurs and the resulting mixture assumes an intermediate molecular weight. It is therefore desirable to segregate monohydroxyaromatic reactant and low molecular weight polymer from high molecular weight product. Under such conditions, the reaction kinetics provide a high molecular weight product with the use of less catalyst, a lower residence time and less oxygen. The invention takes advantage of these conditions by conducting the reaction in a system which segregates higher molecular weight product, in which hydroxy group concentration is low, from the lower molecular weight material in which it is higher. This segregation is accomplished by the use of a continuous limited back mixing reactor of the type described hereinafter. The result is an increase in the overall rate of polymerization. Typical monohydroxyaromatic compounds hereinafter sometimes referred to as phenols for brevity useful in the process of this invention are those having the formulaEMI3.1 where R1 is a lower primary alkyl group and R2 is a lower primary or secondary alkyl group, the word lower meaning that it contains up to 7 carbon atoms. Examples of lower primary alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, isobutyl, n amyl, isoamyl, 2 methylbutyl, n hexyl, 2,3 dimethylbutyl, 2 , 3 or 4 methylpentyl and the corresponding heptyl groups. Examples of lower secondary alkyl groups are isopropyl, sec butyl and 3 pentyl. Preferably, R1 and R2 are straight chain rather than branched.Since the polyphenylene oxides in which R1 and R2 are other than methyl generally have no more desirable properties than those in which R1 and R2 are both methyl, and since 2,6 xylenol is the most readily available and cheapest 2,6 dialkylphenol, its use is preferred. The polyphenylene oxide obtained is then poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenylene oxide . Other suitable phenols are disclosed in the 87, 875 and 341 patents, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. Various catalyst systems have been disclosed for the preparation of polyphenylene oxides, and any of them can be used in the process of this invention. For the most part, they contain at least one heavy metal compound such as a copper, manganese or cobalt compound, usually in combination with various other materials A first class of preferred catalyst systems consist of those containing copper They are usually combinations of cuprous or cupric ions, halide i.e., chloride, bromide or iodide ions and at least one amine The source of copper can be any of the cupric or cuprous salts disclosed in the 874 and 875 patents. See, for example, 874 from column 3, line 62, to column 4, line 61.The halide ion is preferably bromide, and its source can be any of those disclosed in the 341 patent particular reference is made to column 8, line 61, to column 9, line 53. For example, it can be an inorganic bromide except for ammonium bromide, because the ammonium ion can also form a strong complex with copper ions and can include bromine and hydrogen bromide. Also useful are organic bromine compounds which, under reaction conditions, produce bromide ions. An example thereof is 4 bromo 2,6 xylenol. The only basic requirement is that the bromine compound be capable of supplying a form of bromide ion which is soluble in the reaction mixture. If the bromine compound itself is insoluble, it can still be satisfactory if it forms soluble complexes with the amine constituents of the catalyst or produces a soluble product under oxidative coupling conditions.When metal bromides other than the copper bromides are used, the particular metal used is merely one of choice. Since some of these materials e.g., cobalt form complexes with amines, suitable adjustments in the amount of amine used may sometimes be necessary. Because of low cost and ready availability, when using a metal bromide often the alkali or alkaline earth metal bromides are used, e.g., sodium bromide. Since hydrogen bromide will react with amines to form an amine hydrobromide salt and bromine will brominate the phenol and simultaneously produce hydrogen bromide, again adjustments in the amount of amine may be necessary in such situations. The currently preferred bromide source is HBr, which may conveniently be combined with the copper source as a solution of cuprous oxide in aqueous hydrobromic acid. The amine constituents of the copper catalyst system may be any of those disclosed in the 874, 875, S66 and 341 patents. Preferably, however, the amines comprise at least one secondary alkylene diamine and at least one tertiary monoamine. The secondary alkylene diamine may be selected from those disclosed in the 341 patent, especially from column 6, line 44, to column 8, line 11. It generally has the formula 3 4 5 R NH R4 NHR5 wherein each of R and R5 is a secondary or tertiary alkyl group and R4 is a divalent hydrocarbon group, and wherein at least two and no more than three carbon atoms separate the two amino nitrogen atoms and the carbon atoms to which the amino nitrogens are attached are aliphatic. Preferably, there are only two carbon atoms separating the two amino nitrogens. The two or three carbon atoms separating the amino nitrogens can be either acyclic or cyclic carbon atoms.Typical examples of R4 include ethylene, 1,2 and 1,3 propylene, 1,2 , 1,3 and 2,3 butylene, the various pentylene isomers having from two or three carbon atoms separating the two free valences, phenylethylene, tolylethylene, 2 phenyl 1, 2 propylene, cyclohexylethylene, 1,2 or 1,3 cy clohexylene, 1,2 cyclopropylene, 1,2 cyclobutylene and 1,2 cyclopentylene. Typical examples of R3 and R5 include isopropyl and tertiary alkyl e.g., t butyl groups. The substituents on the carbon atoms can be straight or branched chain alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or alkaryl. Other examples include those set forth in the 341 patent, column 8, lines 2 11, e.g., 2 methyl 2 butyl, etc. The currently preferred secondary alkylene diamine is N, N di t butylethylenediamine. The tertiary monoamine can be selected from those dif loosed in the 341 patent specific reference should be made to column 8, lines 12 33. It can be a heterocyclic amine or a trialkylamine characterized by having the amine nitrogen attached to at least two groups which have a small cross sectional area. In the case of a trialkylamine, it is preferred that at least two of the alkyl groups be methyl with the third being a C18 primary or C38 secondary alkyl, and it is more preferred that the third substituent have no more than four carbon atoms. The currently preferred tertiary monoamine is dlmethyl n butylamine. At least one secondary monoamine as disclosed in the 874 patent from column 4, line 62 to column 6, line 13 may optionally also be used. In addition to functioning as part of the catalyst and increasing the activity thereof, the secondary amine frequently becomes chemically bonded to the polymer, at least in part, and increases the impact strength thereof, particularly in blends with other polymers such as polystyrenes. It is believed that the increase in impact is achieved by a crosslinking reaction similar to that disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,054,553 at column 6, lines 28 60. The currently preferred secondary monoamines are dimethylamine and di n butylamine. The use of dimthylamine for this purpose in polyphenylene oxide preparation is disclosed and claimed in copending, commonly assigned application Serial No. 501,477, filed June 6, 1983. It is within the scope of the invention to use copper catalyst systems containing complex salts such as copper I N,N di t butylethylenediamine 2,6 xylenoxide, as disclosed and claimed in copending, commonly assigned application Serial No. 572,036, filed January 19, 1984. Manganese containing systems constitute a second preferred class of catalysts. They are generally alkaline systems containing divalent manganese and such anions as halide, alkoxide or phenoxide. Most often, the manganese is present as a complex with one or more complexing and or chelating agents such as dialkylamines, alkanolamines, alkyl enediamines, o hydroxy aromatic aldehydes, o hydroxyazo compounds, z hydroxyoximes monomeric and polymeric , o hydroxyaryl oximes and ss diketones As in the copper containing systems, secondary amines such as dialkylamines frequently become chemically bound to the polyphenylene oxide product and increase its impact strength. The following patents are incorporated by reference herein for their disclosures of manganese containing catalyst systems 3,956,2z2 4,075,174 4 110,312 3,962,181 4,083,828 4,184,034 3,965,069 4,093,596 4,315,086 3,972,851 4,093,597 4,335,233 4,05D,553 4,093,598 4,385,168. 4,058,504 4,102,865 Also useful in the method of this invention are.cobalt containing catalyst systems such as those disclosed in U.S. Patents, 3,455,880 and 4,058,504, the disclosures of which are also incorporated by reference herein. A phase transfer catalyst may optionally be used in the reaction system as a reaction rate promoter. Useful phase transfer catalysts are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,988,297, hereby inco orated by reference specific refer ence is made to column 2, lines 11 26, and column 3, lines 1 23. The currently preferred phase transfer catalyst especially for copper containing systems is Adogen 464, which is a methyltrialkylammonium chloride wherein the alkyl groups have from 8 to 10 carbon atoms. One or more solvents may be present in the reaction mixture. The function of the solvent is to provide a liquid phase in which both the phenol and catalyst are soluble. It need not, but preferably does, act as a solvent for the reaction products. Typical solvents for copper containing systems are disclosed in the 874, 875 and 341 patents. Illustrative solvents for this purpose are toluene and benzene other inexpensive and readily available commercial solvents may also be used. For manganese systems, solvents of the same type may be used in combination with minor amounts usually about 5 10 by weight of lower alkanols preferably methanol or the like which maintain the manganese compounds in solution. According to the present invention, the entire oxidative coupling reaction producing the polyphenylene oxide is carried out continuously in a continuous flow tubular reactor containing multiple reaction stages, each of which is agitated. Such reactors are known to have limited back mixing that is, to approach plug flow. The term plug flow is defined in Levenspiel, Chemical Reaction Engineering, Second Edition, p. 97, as follows It is characterized by the fact that the flow of fluid through the reactor is orderly with no ele ment of fluid overtaking or mixing with any other element ahead or behind. Actually, there may be lateral mixing of fluid in a plug flow reactor however, there must be no mixing or diffusion along the flow path. Thus, limited back mixing in the present context means that there is little or, ideally, no mixing of high molecular weight with lower molecular weight polyphenylene oxide. A typical reactor used according to this invention is divided into multiple reaction zones by horizontal baffles which restrict the flow of fluid from one stage to a preceding zone. Such a reactor is frequently referred to hereinafter as a multi zone reactor . One skilled in the art will recognize that the degree of back mixing in such a reactor can be controlled by such design variables as the number of zones and the cross sectional area of the horizontal baffles with respect to the cross sectional area of the column. Typically the multi zone reactor is an upright cylindrical vessel. Oxygen is sparged into the multi zone reactor and each stage is agitated to provide efficient gas liquid mixing, typically by turbine agitators. However, other agitation methods can be used such as reciprocating plate agitators and the like. For obvious reasons, the direction of oxygen flow is generally from the lower to the upper end of the reactor.The liquid feed stream flow may be co current lower to upper end or countercurrent upper to lower end . If co current flow is employed, back mixing is minimized but water formed in the reaction settles to the lower end of the reactor. Since water may cause partial catalyst deactivation, its removal is preferred. This may be conveniently achieved by providing a separator vessel or the like into which water of reaction settles and from which it may be removed. With countercurrent flow, water is removed from the reactor with the product stream, at the expense of a somewhat greater degree of back mixing. The number of zones in the multi zone reactor will obviously be greater than one, since one stage would be equivalent to a continuous flow stirred tank reactor. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, more zones provide more limited back mixing. It is currently believed that at least two zones will be necessary to achieve any significant limitation of back mixing, and at least five zones are preferred. The number of zones will generally be set by process economics since increasing the number of zones will increase the cost of the reactor. Practically speaking, a reactor with more than 50 zones is unlikely, and usually about 5 20 zones are acceptable. Agitation is provided in the reactor so as to ensure good gas liquid contact between the reaction solution and oxygen being sparged therein. The oxygen flow rate is at least stoichiometric for the conversion, and is generally at least two times stoichiometric to assist in increasing the gas liquid interfacial area. It does not appear that a flow rate as high as five times stoichiometric substantially assists the reaction and, as will be apparent to one skilled in the art, the use of too high a flow rate could lead to stripping of solvent or liquid catalyst ingredients and, of course, wasting oxygen. The pressure in the second stage reaction system is typically atmospheric with oxygen being sparged thereinto at one atmosphere. If desired, the oxygen can be diluted with inert gases or air can be used, but the use of pure oxygen is preferred. Sub or superatmospheric pressures can be used but are seldom if ever necessary. The temperature is typically on the order of about 20 600C, preferably 30 500C. Cooling and heating of the reactor can be accomplished in conventional manner, e.g., cooling coils internal to the reactor or an external cooling jacket can be used. It is also possible to cool and or heat various zones differently. For example it may sometimes be advantageous to cool the initial zone of the reactor to remove heat of reaction while heating later zones to decrease solution viscosity. The average liquid residence time in the reactor is about 5 90 minutes, preferably 10 60 minutes. Exceedingly low residence times are insufficient for the desired increase in molecular weight, and at exceedingly high residence times catalyst deactivation is encountered. When a copper catalyst system is employed, it is frequently preferred to mix the non gaseous constituents i.e., phenol, components of the catalyst, solvent and phase transfer catalyst when used under conditions of high phenol concentration. These conditions may result in higher conversion and a decrease in amount of catalyst required. They may be achieved by blending the non gaseous constituents in the first stage of the reactor. Alternatively, said con stltue lts may be pre mixed in an inert e.g., nitrogen or helium atmosphere to form a homogeneous mixture which is fed to the first stage, as is disclosed in U.S.Patent 4,477,690, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. It is believed that the ingredients of the copper catalyst system interact with each other more efficiently in the absence of oxidant i.e., oxygen and in the presence of a high concentration of phenol, resulting in higher conversion and a decrease in amount of catalyst required when a pre mixing stage in an inert atmosphere is employed. Such a pre mixing stage frequently promotes formation of the actual catalyst species under extremely favorable conditions.Inert pre mixing is generally neither required nor suitable when a manganese catalyst system is employed, since maximum catalyst activity in such systems is attained by adding the manganese reagent to a phenol oxygen mixture and maintaining it in continuous contact with oxygen to the extent possible Pre mixing may be effected in a batch or continuous operation. When it is a batch operation, the copper and halide ions should be added last in order that they will be solubilized by complex formation with the amines. It is within the scope of the invention to pre mix and store a large catalyst batch, using it as required in the polymerization process. In continuous in line mixing operations, the order of mixing should be as previously described. When inert pre mixing in a separate vessel is employed, no special addition order is necessary since each catalyst ingredient is always present in said vessel. Under these conditions, a catalyst species is formed which is highly active under oxidative coupling condlt ss.s and W retains high activity for a relatively long period of time, thus continuing to promote effective polymerization for the duration of the polymerization process. The polyphenylene oxides produced by the process of this invention typically have weight average molecular weights of about 5,000 to 75,000, corresponding to intrinsic viscosities of about 0.1 0.75 dl. g. as determined in chlor oform at 250C. The percent product in the final reaction solution is obviously determined by the amount of phenol introduced, since essentially all of said phenol is converted to polymer per the present invention. The product polymer may be isolated from solution by conventional methods such as precipitation by addition of a n.on solvent for the polymer. One unique benefit of the process of the present invention is its high flexibility with respect to the use of various proportions of materials, enabling one to prepare polyphenylene oxides of varying molecular weights with flexibility. However, as with all processes, there are certain preferred proportions which are now discussed. The phenol is generally used in an amount of about 5 60 of total solution weight, preferably 10 40 and most preferably 15 25 ,D. Products which have a commercially desirable molecular weight are most easily obtained in the area of 20 phenol. Metal e.g., copper or manganese ratios are generally 1 mole of metal to about 100 1500 and preferably 250 1000 moles of phenol. In the case of a copper system., the molar ratio of hali de preferably bromide to copper ions in the catalyst affects catalyst activity, and a ratio of at least about 3.5 moles halide to 1 mole copper is preferred. The upper limit of this ratio is not critical and molar ratios as high as 6 or 12 or more can be used. Currently preferred molar ratios are 4 6 moles Br per mole Cu.The secondary alkylene diamine is generally used in an amount of about 0.4 3 moles, and the tertiary monoamine in an amount of about 10 100 moles and preferably 20 60 moles, per mole of copper. The molar ratio of phenol to alkali usually sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in a manganese system is usually about 5 40 1. It is most often about 10 20 1. The secondary monoamine, when present, is generally used in an amount up to 3 mole percent based on phenol, with 0.5 2 mole percent being preferred. The phase transfer agent, when present, is typically used in an amount of up to 0.8 ó, preferably 0.1 0.2, by weight based on phenol. It is within the scope of the invention to introduce all of each reagent at the beginning of the system, or to introduce various reagents incrementally at various points in the system. For example, when a pre mixing stage is employed the entire amount of phenol may be introduced into said pre mixing stage, or a portion thereof typically about 20 50 of the total amount may be added at a later stage. Under these conditions, the proportion of by product diphenoquinone e.g., tetramethyldiphenoquinone in the product stream is reduced, since it has been found that high phenol concentration in early stages often promotes diphenoquinone formation. Catalyst ingredients can also be introduced incrementally, although replenishment of copper catalyst in major amount in a later zone is not as important when a pre mixing stage is present as when it is absent.The catalyst ingredients most usually added incrementally are copper, bromide and secondary alkylene di amine. If incremental addition is employed, the following weight percentage amounts of these reagents are typically added in later zones Copper 5 25 , preferably 20 25 Bromide 10 30 , preferably 25 30 Diamine 20 50 , preferably 30 50 . Per the process of the present invention the molecular weight of the polyphenylene oxide obtained can be controlled in simple fashion, with the primary process parameters which affect molecular weight being the ratio of catalyst to phenol, the percent monomer in the solution, the temperature and residence time in the reactor The degree of agitation and oxygen introduction rate are generally secondary parameters. Reference is now made to the drawings in whichFIGURE I is a schematic diagram of a continuous multi zone limited back mixing reactor useful in the process of this invention and FIGURE II is a cross sectional view of one stage of said reactor along the line II II of FIGURE I. Reactor 1 as shown in FIGURE I has ten zones, one of which is designated as 2 and shown in cross section inFIGURE II. Oxygen is sparged via line 3, reaction solution is introduced via line 4 and product is withdrawn via line 5. Alternatively, reaction solution may be introduced at the top and product withdrawn at the bottom of the reactor. Centred in each zone is a turbine agitator 6 all such agitators are driven by motor 7 via shaft 8. Each zone is provided with four equally spaced vertical baffles 9 and with a horizontal baffle 10, the latter comprising an outer section 11 attached to the inner wall of reaction 1 and an inner section 12 attached to shaft 8. Between them, outer section 11 and inner section 12 define an annular area 13 of limited back mixing. Usually, annular area 13 comprises about 2 15 , most often about 4 8 , of the inner cross sectional area of reactor 1. The invention is illustrated by the following examples. All percentages are by weight of total solution unless otherwise indicated, and all mole amounts are per 1000 moles of 2,6 xylenol in the original feed solution.Copper and bromide were provided in the form of a Cu2O solution in 48two aqueous HBr. The following abbreviations are used DBEDA N,N di t butylethylenediamine DMBA dimethyl n butylamine DBA di n butylamine. Intrinsic viscosities were measured in chloroform at 250C. EXAMPLE 1 The apparatus consisted of a multi zone reactor as shown in FIGURE I. It had an internal diameter of 3 inches, was 30 inches long and contained 10 identical zones. With reference to FIGURE II, inner section 12 had a diameter of 1.5 inches and annular area 13 had a width of 0.125 inch.The diameter of each turbine agitator 6 was 1.5 inches each such agitator had 6 f at blades mounted on shaft 8 and was located midway between the top and bottom of its zone. Four vertical baffles 9, each 0.25 inch wide, were equally spaced around the circumference of the vessel. The turbines were rotated at 550 rpm. and the reactor was operated at slightly above ambient pressure typically 0 5 psig. . The reactor was cooled or heated as necessary by means of a water jacket. Feed solutions containing 20 2,6 xylenol in toluene were prepared and fed co currently with oxygen to the reaction, with the solution feed rate being regulated so as to provide the desired residence time in the reactor. After steady state conditions were achieved, the reactor was operated continuously for 3 1 2 hours at an average temperature of 42 2 C. The polyphenylene oxide products were isolated by diluting the solution thereof with one volume of toluene and then with approximately five volumes of methanol, filtering and drying in conventional manner. EXAMPLES 2 7 The conditions were similar to those in Example 1, with various differences in mole ratios, proportions, addition rates and residence times.
