# Position finding system.

## Abstract
Three fixed reference stations S0, S1, S2 having known positions comprise Omega receivers 10, 16, 18 . Phase measurements made at all three stations are assembled at a master station S0 , utilising landlines 24 or radio links and, using the known positions of the stations, a central proces sing unit 12 calculates not merely the offset of the master station as measured from the true position but also the errors in the azimuths of the propagation directions of the received signals. The position measurement of a vehicle V with an Omega receiver 26 is corrected on the basis of the offset and also the errors in the said azimuths. Sufficient accuracy is achieved for finding the position of land based vehicles V whose position may be calculated subject to the corrections in the master station S0 on the basis of raw data transmitted to the master station over a link 30 . Alternative ly the azimuth corrections may be transmitted to the vehicle over the link 30 . Two fixed stations suffice if they can measure absolute phase.
