## Description
This invention relates to electrical induction apparatus, e.g. electric power transformers, specifically to the dielectric fluids coolants contained therein and especially to those coolants consisting of or containing as a constituent, polychlorinated biphenyl, PCB. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods for converting PCB containing electrical induction apparatus, e.g. transformers, into substantially PCB free transformers in order to qualify said transformers as non PCB transformers under U. S. government regulations. Because of their fire resistance, chemical and thermal stability, and good dielectric properties, PCB s have been found to be excellent transformer coolants. USP 2,582,200 discloses the use of PCB s alone or in admixture with compatible viscosity modifiers, e.g., trichlorobenzene, and such trichlorobenzene PCB mixtures have been termed generically askarels . These askarels may also contain minor quantities of additives such as ethyl silicate, epoxy compounds and other materials used as scavengers for halogen decomposition products which may result from potential electric arcing. ASTM D 2283 75 describes several types of askarels and delineates their physical and chemical specifications. However, PCB s have been cited in the United States Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 as an environmental and physiological hazard, and because of their high chemical stability, they are non biodegradable. Hence, they will persist in the environment and are even subject to biological magnification accumulation in higher orders of life through the food chain . Accordingly, in the U. S., transformers are no longer made with PCB or askarel fluids. While older units containing PCB may still be used under some circumstances, it is necessary to provide special precautions such as containment dikes and maintain regular inspections. Transformers containing PCB s are at a further disadvantage since maintenance requiring the core to be detanked is prohibited, and the transformer owner remains responsible for all environmental contamination, including clean up costs, due to leakage, tank rupture, or other spillage of PCB s, or due to toxic by product emissions resulting from fires. To replace a PCB containing transformer, it is necessary to 1 remove the transformer from service, 2 drain the PCB and flush the unit in a prescribed manner, 3 remove the unit and replace with a new transformer, and 4 transport the old transformer to an approved landfill for burial or to a solid waste incinerator . Even then, the owner who contracts to have it buried still owns the transformer and is still responsible liable for any future pollution problems caused by it. Liquid wastes generated during replacement must be incinerated at special approved sites. Thus replacement of a PCB transformer can be expensive, but more importantly, since most pure PCB or askarel transformers are indoors, in building basements or in special enclosed vaults with limited access, it may not be physically feasible to remove or install a transformer, nor would it be desirable from an asset management perspective. A desired approach to the problem would be to replace the PCB oil with an innocuous, compatible fluid. A number of fluid types have been used in new transformers as reported in Robert A. Westin, Assessment of the Use of Selected Replacement Fluids for PCB s in Electrical Equipment , EPA, NTIS, PB 296377, March 1, 1979 J. Reason and W. Bloomquist, PCB Replacements Where the Transformer Industry Stands Now , Of all the non PCB fluids, silicone oils have been the most widely accepted. Their chemical, physical, and electrical properties are excellent. They have high fire points 300 C , and no known toxic or environmental problems. These oils are trimethylsilyl end blocked poly dimethylsiloxanes of the formula Replacement of PCB containing askarels in older transformers with silicone oils or one of the other substitute fluids would seem to be a simple matter, but it is not. A typical transformer contains a great deal of cellulosic insulating material to prevent electrical coils, etc., from improper contact and electrical arcing. This material is naturally soaked with askarel, and may contain from 3 to 12 of the total fluid volume of the transformer. This absorbed askarel will not drain out, nor can it be flushed out by any known means, however efficient. Once the original bulk askarel is replaced with a fresh non PCB fluid, the slow process of diffusion permits the old absorbed askarel to gradually leach out, and the PCB content of the new fluid will rise. Thus, the new coolant becomes contaminated. For purposes of classification of transformers, the U. S. government regulation has designated those fluids with greater than 500 ppm PCB as PCB transformers , those with 50 500 ppm PCB as PCB contaminated transformers , and those with less than 50 ppm PCB as non PCB transformers . While major expenses may be entailed with the first two classifications in the event of a spill or the necessity of disposal, the last category is free of U. S. government regulation. To achieve the last classification, the PCB concentration must remain below 50 ppm for at least 90 days, with the transformer in service and sufficiently energized that temperatures of 50 C or higher are realized. This requires a 90 day averaged rate of elution of 0.56 ppm day. It is anticipated that most, if not all, states of the U. S. will adopt regulations which may be the same as, or stricter, than U. S. government regulations. More lenient regulations may be possible elsewhere. There are a number of commercial retrofill procedures on the market including those described in The RetroSil PCB Removal System , Promotional literature of Dow Corning Corp., 10 205 82 1982 , and trade literature of Positive Technologies, Inc. on the Zero PC Forty process. These utilize initial clean out procedures of as high efficiency as possible during which the electrical apparatus is not in operation. Most include a series of flushes with liquids such as fuel oil, ethylene glycol, or a number of chlorinated aliphatic or aromatic compounds. Trichloroethylene is a favorite flush fluid. Some processes, such as the Positive Technologies, Inc. Zero PC Forty process use a fluorocarbon vapor scrub alternating with the liquid flushes. When the initial clean out procedure is complete, the transformer is filled with silicone fluid. As effective as these elaborate flushing procedures might have been expected to be, they cannot remove PCB adsorbed into the interstices of the cellulosic material. Consequently, the PCB content of the silicone coolant gradually rises as the residual PCB leaches out while the transformer is in use. Therefore, if one wishes to reach a PCB free state non PCB as defined by U. S. government regulations , it is necessary to either periodically change out, or continually clean up, the silicone fluid until a leach rate of less than 50 ppm for 90 days is reached. Periodic change out is very expensive, and because both the silicone and PCB are essentially non volatile, distillation to separate them is not practicable and other methods of separation are expensive or ineffective. Dow Corning in its RetroSil process uses a continual carbon filtration to clean up the fluid The RetroSil PCB Removal System , Promotional literature of Dow Corning Corp., 10 205 82 1982 Jacqueline Cox, Silicone Transformer Fluid from Dow Reduces PCB Levels to EPA Standards , The problem and its cause are discussed in L. A. Morgan and R. C. Ostoff, Problems Associated with the Retrofilling of Askarel Transformers , IEEE Power Eng. Soc., Winter Meeting, N.Y., N.Y., Jan. 30 Feb. 4, 1977, pap. A77, p. 120 9. The solubility of a typical silicone oil in PCB is practically nil 0.5 at temperatures up to and over 100 C, while the solubility of PCB in the silicone ranges from only 10 at 25 C to 12 at 100 C. While this limited solubility does not restrict the bulk silicone from dissolving the available free PCB, it does restrict the ability of the PCB to diffuse from the pores or interstices of the cellulosic matter. Within any given pore filled with PCB containing coolant, diffusion of PCB out must be accompanied by diffusion of silicone in. At some point within the pore there must exist an interface between the PCB containing coolant and the silicone, across which neither material can very rapidly diffuse. Because the PCB is more soluble in the silicone than the reverse, the PCB will slowly diffuse into the silicone while the interface advances gradually into the pore. The limited solubility restricts the rate of diffusion and while this mechanism might eventually clean the pore of PCB, it is orders of magnitude slower than if the silicone and PCB were miscible. The high viscosity of the silicone and many other coolants is also an inhibiting factor. The result is a long drawn out leach period of perhaps several years, during which the silicone must be continually filtered or periodically replaced to remove PCB s from it. Thus, the slow leaching of PCB s out of the solid insulation by the silicone is worse than no leaching at all since the dangers of a spill of PCB containing materials will persist over a period of years. Experimental studies by Morgan and Osthoff showed, for example, that effective PCB diffusivities into a typical silicone oil were only 1 10 of those into a 10 centistoke hydrocarbon oil. Although one might prefer, then, to retrofill with such a hydrocarbon oil, if it were not for the fire hazard of hydrocarbons, there still also is the problem of separating the PCB from the contaminated hydrocarbon oil which is high boiling like the PCB and like the silicone oil. More importantly, undiluted PCBs are highly viscous and thus relatively immobile. Askarels contain PCB dissolved in TCB trichlorobenzene or mixtures of TCB and TTCB tetrachlorobenzene which thins out or reduces the viscosity of the PCB. TCB is much more soluble in silicone than is PCB and, therefore, TCB is removed from the askarel residing within the interstices of the insulation leaving highly viscous PCB with or without small amounts of diluents, TCB or mixtures within the interstices. Consequently, treatments with silicone e.g. as in the Dow RetroSil system , without prior treatment according to this invention, are counter productive and render the PCB remaining in the interstices even more difficult to remove. This can explain the lack of commercial success of prior systems in reclassifying transformers to a non PCB status. The present invention is based upon the unexpected finding that dielectric silicone oils can and do elute PCB from the internal insulation of electrical apparatus at an unexpectedly high rate, provided that the coolant in the transformer is first replaced with a relatively low viscosity interim coolant that is miscible with PCB, for example, TCB or mixtures thereof with TTCB. The subsequent rate of elution of PCB into silicone oil coolant, when practicing the present invention, was found to be surprisingly high and approximates or comes close to approximating the rates of elution of PCB into relatively low viscosity interim coolants such as TCB or mixtures thereof with PCB. Accordingly the present invention involves a suitable temporary or interim leaching cooling fluid readily miscible with PCB and having a relatively low viscosity as a substitute for PCB containing coolants in electrical induction apparatus, e.g. transformers, having a vessel containing the coolant and an electrical winding with porous solid cellulosic electrical insulation immersed in and impregnated with PCB while electrically operating the transformer for a sufficient period of time to elute PCB from the solid electrical insulation contained in the transformer. During the period of interim operation, the interim dielectric cooling fluid can be changed to speed up the elution process the interim goal being to achieve a rate of elution of PCB into said interim coolant which is not more than 5 times the selected target rate, preferably not more than 3 times the selected target rate, and more preferably not more than 2 times the selected target rate. In terms of U. S. government regulations for obtaining a non PCB transformer, the interim goal is to achieve a rate of elution of PCB into said interim coolant not greater than 3 ppm PCB per day and preferably in the range of 0.6 to 3 ppm PCB per day based on silicone oil dielectric to be used as permanent coolant e.g., 0.4 to 5 ppm PCB per day based on the weight of interim coolant when said interim coolant is TCB mix a mixture of 65 70 wt. of trichlorobenzene and 35 30 wt. of tetrachlorobenzene . The difference in density grams per cubic centimeter at 25 C. of TCB mix 1.492 and silicone oil 0.975 for L 305 accounts for the differences in the PCB elution rate figures depending upon the eluant basis, e.g. TCB mix basis or silicone oil basis, because the elution rates are expressed in ppm which is on a weight basis, the volume of eluants or coolants in the transformer being constant. Since the density of TCB mix is 1.51 times the density of silicone oil the rate of elution based on silicone oil is 1.51 times the rate of elution based on TCB mix. In order to meet the U. S. government requirement for non PCB transformers, the ultimate selected target rate of elution would have to average below 0.55 ppm PCB per day, based on the weight of the silicone oil dielectric, In order for the PCB content of the silicone oil coolant in the transformer to remain below 50 ppm over a 90 day period. The ultimate selected target rate of elution can be lower or higher depending upon the regulations of the particular jurisdiction in which the transformer being treated is located. There may be some jurisdictions outside the United States which have no regulations concerning PCB content, in which case the transformer owner may select a target rate to reduce potential liability in the event of a transformer spill. After the amount of leachable PCB in the transformer has been reduced to the desired degree, the interim dielectric cooling fluid is removed from the vessel and the vessel is then filled with a PCB free dielectric silicone oil cooling fluid compatible with the transformer. The transformer is then operated until the rate of elution of PCB into the silicone oil coolant is less than the selected target rate of elution. The dielectric silicone oil coolant can be changed over to fresh dielectric silicone oil coolant as many times as is necessary or desirable in order to achieve less than the selected target rate of elution. After a rate less than the selected target rate is reached, the transformer is reclassified as a non PCB transformer. As an important part of the present invention, the resulting transformer contains silicone oil coolant which is not only substantially free of PCB but which is also substantially free of TCB or TTCB. The following describes a procedure according to this invention by which a PCB fluid in a transformer is replaced with a permanent PCB free liquid coolant Fig. 1 contains plots of concentrations, ppm, of PCB in an interim dielectric fluid TCB mix during the fourth leach cycle, in the silicone oil during cycles 5, 6 and 7 in an actual transformer with concentrations plotted on the vertical scale vs. days elapsed or soak time on the horizontal scale. TCB mix was used in the first three cycles . The figure graphically illustrates the surprising results obtained by this invention. The rate of elution of PCB by the silicone oil resulting from the application of the present invention is unexpectedly high. Fig. 2 contains plots of concentrations, ppm, of PCB in the silicone oil during cycles 2 and 3 in an actual transformer with concentrations plotted on the vertical scale versus days elapsed on the horizontal scale. Fig. 3 contains plots of concentrations, ppm, of PCB in the silicone oil during cycle 2 in an actual transformer with concentrations plotted on the vertical scale versus days elapsed on the horizontal scale. The selected target rate of elution of PCB into silicone oil coolant is 0.56 ppm of PCB per day based on the weight of silicone oil coolant when it is desired to provide less than 50 ppm PCB elution for a 90 day period. In order to take advantage of the rapidness of elution of PCB by the silicone oil as illustrated by Cycle 5 in the figure without sustaining the relatively slower elution rate by the silicone oil as shown in the latter stages of Cycle 6, it is preferred that the changeover from interim coolant to the silicone oil coolant be made after the elution rate into the interim coolant drops below three times the selected target rate of elution. More preferably, the changeover is made when the rate of elution of PCB into the interim coolant drops below 2.5 times the selected target rate of elution. Still more preferably, the changeover is made when the elution rate into the interim coolant drops below about 2 times the selected target rate of elution. With respect to the flushing step, while efficient draining and flushing techniques should be used, these do not in themselves constitute the invention, but are a part of all heretofore known retrofill procedures. They are a prelude to the most efficient embodiment of the invention itself, but their value heretofore has been overrated, in that it is the slow leach rate, not the efficiency of flush which has been found to limit the rate of PCB removal. A wide variety of solvents may be used in the flushing step, including hydrocarbons such as gasoline, kerosene, mineral oil or mineral spirits, toluene, turpentine, or xylene, a wide range of chlorinated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, ketones, and so forth. However, from a materials handling standpoint and PCB separation logistics, it is practical to avoid using any more chemical types than necessary, so that the use of the intended temporary leach fluid, e.g., TCB or mixtures thereof with tetrachlorobenzene, as the initial flush is most practical. Interim dielectric cooling fluids other than normally liquid trichlorobenzene, TCB, or a mixture thereof with tetrachlorobenzene, can be used. The preferred interim fluid has the following characteristics a it is compatible with PCB i.e. preferably dissolving at least 50 of its weight of PCB, more preferably, at least 90 of its Weight of PCB and, most preferably, being miscible in all proportions with PCB , and is compatible with the silicone oil b it is of low enough molecular weight to have good molecular mobility to be able to enter the pores or interstices of the solid insulating material and it promotes rapid mutual diffusion, preferably, having a viscosity at 25 C of 10 mm² s cst. or less and, more preferably, 3mm² s cst. , or less, c it can be easily separated e.g., by distillation from PCB and it preferably, has a boiling point of 275 C or less and, more preferably, 260 C or less from PCB d it is presently considered environmentally innocuous and e it is compatible with typical transformer internals. While TCB, or mixtures with tetrachlorobenzene, is preferred, a number of alternatives, as above mentioned can be used. These would include modified and synthetic hydrocarbons, and a variety of halogenated aromatic and aliphatic compounds. There are also a variety of liquid trichlorobenzene isomer mixtures. The preferred TCB fluid would be a mixture of these isomers with or without tetrachlorobenzene isomers. The advantage lies in the fact that such a mixture has a lower freezing point than do the individual isomers, thus reducing the chance of it solidifying within the transformers in very cold climates. Further, the mixtures are often the normal result of manufacture and hence can cost less than the separated and purified individual isomers. However, any solvent in which PCB is soluble can be used for flushing and as an interim dielectric cooling liquid for the leaching of PCB contained in a transformer. Chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene, trichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, tetrachloroethane, chlorinated toluenes, chlorinated xylenes, liquid trichlorobenzene and its isomers and mixtures, and liquid tetrachlorobenzene and its isomers and mixtures are suitable. Hydrocarbon solvents such as gasoline, kerosene, mineral oil, mineral spirits, toluene, turpentine and xylene can also be used but may be considered to be too flammable for safe use. Particularly suitable solvents are the trichlorobenzenes and tetrachlorobenzenes because of their low flammability characteristics, their high PCB compatibility and their ability to circulate throughout the transformer vessel and into the pores or interstices of the solid insulating material. Because the preferred objective here is to leach out the PCB at the fastest practical rate, the preferred embodiment involves operating the transformer to obtain the fastest possible diffusion rates of PCB into the interim coolant pursuant to step 3 above and into the dielectric silicone oil pursuant to step 7 above. When used at its full rated loading, a transformer should automatically provide enough heat for this purpose. However, since many transformers are operated below their rated loading and below their rated safe temperature usually 70 C to 110 C , sufficiently elevated temperatures e.g., at least 50 C might not be achieved without thermal lagging or external heating. While this thermal control represents a preferred embodiment of this invention, it is optional and not an essential requirement, there being many transformers for which such lagging or heating may be impractical. Leaching at lower temperatures, even ambient, is workable but will take longer. Fluid circulation as specified in steps 3 and 7 is optional but is an advantageous embodiment in that such circulation will prevent the build up of concentration gradients which can act to retard diffusion. Since elution is a slow process, the circulation rate need not be very rapid. Violent circulation, of course, is to be avoided in order to avoid damage to the internal structure of the transformer. It is recognized that many transformers may not, by their construction or placement, be readily modified to utilize a circulation loop, and such circulation is not considered a necessary aspect, but only one embodiment of this invention to increase elution rates. In most transformers, natural thermal gradients alone will induce sufficient circulation especially in those cases where a relatively low viscosity, mobile coolant, such as TCB, is used. As the PCB content in the TCB or other interim coolant or in the silicone oil dielectric coolant in the transformer builds up, it can eventually reach a point where diffusion no longer serves to leach PCB from the cellulosic pores or interstices of the insulation within the transformer tank. A reduction in elution rate as determined by sample analysis, is a clue that this may be occurring. If it is determined that this is occurring, it may become necessary as specified in steps 4 and 7 to replace the PCB laden interim dielectric cooling fluid or the dielectric silicone oil with fresh PCB free fluid or oil. This is most easily accomplished by deenergizing the transformer, draining out the contaminated leach fluid interim dielectric coolant or silicone oil , and replacing it with fresh fluid or oil. As a practical matter, instead of monitoring the elution rate to determine when diffusion no longer serves to effectively leach PCB from the pores or interstices of the electrical insulation, it is more practical to schedule the transformer for regular coolant changes. If a non PCB transformer is desired, coolant changes are made after selected periods of electrical operation until the coolant elutes less than 50 ppm of PCB on silicone oil coolant basis after 90 days operation. Periods of electrical operation between coolant changes can be selected to be 20 days to 1 year or more, if the transformer owner s needs prevent shutting down the transformer except at rare specified times, e.g., special holiday periods, such that there may be more than one year between shutdowns, and possibly shutdowns can take place only every other year , preferably 30 to 120 days and most preferably 45 to 90 days. The contaminated leach fluid may then be distilled off and condensed for re use to leave a PCB bottom product which is incinerated or otherwise disposed of pursuant to U. S. government regulations. While a complete change of interim coolant is preferred, it is possible that the inconvenience of additional shutdowns predicates a different procedure, i.e., that of simultaneously introducing new fresh fluid and removing the old contaminated fluid while the transformer remains in operation. Similarly, PCB laden silicone oil can be removed continuously from the transformer while simultaneously continuously introducing fresh PCB free silicone oil. It is less efficient because the fresh fluid or oil mixes with the old in the transformer, and fluid or oil of reduced PCB concentration is actually removed. Thus to eliminate all the PCB, more leach fluid or oil will have to be removed than for the preferred procedure. This penalty can be reduced if one takes pains to avoid excessive mixing. For example, fresh chilled TCB or other interim dielectric cooling fluid can be introduced into the bottom of the transformer, while warm, PCB laden interim dielectric cooling fluid is removed from the top. The density difference will retard mixing. Similarly, fresh chilled silicone oil relatively higher density can be introduced in step 7 into the bottom of the transformer while warm, PCB laden silicone oil relatively lower density is removed from the top. Regardless of the method used, the process will require repetition until the desired PCB level in silicone oil can be maintained. While distillation is the preferred method for separating TCB or other interim dielectric coolant and PCB, other methods may be feasible, especially if fluid other than TCB is chosen as the temporary fluid. The PCB can be removed from the PCB laden silicone oil that may result from step 7 by contacting it e.g. on site while step 7 is being carried out or off site after PCB laden silicone oil has been removed with activated charcoal, zeolites or other adsorbants capable of adsorbing the PCB from the silicone oil. Any other method for removing PCB from the spent silicone oil can be employed. There is some concern that TCB itself, or other chlorinated interim dielectric coolant, such as TTCB and other halogenated solvents, may eventually become suspect as a health hazard, and that the transformer should not be contaminated with TCB or other objectionable interim fluid. The further advantage of the procedure of this invention is that the transformer at the conclusion of the method of this invention not only does not contain any objectionable amounts of PCB but also is substantially free of TCB or any other potentially objectionable interim fluid. Accordingly, the interim coolant can be replaced and the old batch sent to a still for purification, and the first charge of silicone oil can be replaced and the old batch sent to an adsorption system for purification. It is preferred to make the final fill of the transformer with the same silicone oil as was used in the previous leaching with silicone oil step, e.g. step 7 . Alternatively, other silicone oils can be employed In steps f through j of the broad scope of this invention and in steps 6 and 8 of the more specific embodiments described hereinabove. Suitable silicone oils have the general formula It is permissible to use other permanent coolants rather than silicone oil in the final fill of the transformer. Other preferred coolants of a permanent nature that can be used in place of the final silicone oil fill include dioctylphthalate, modified hydrocarbon oils, e.g. RTEmp of RTE Corp., polyalphaolefins, e.g. PAO 13 C of Uniroyal, synthetic ester fluids, and any other compatible permanent fluid. It Is preferred that the permanent dielectric fluid be characterized by a relatively high boiling point compared to said interim dielectric solvent so that the interim dielectric solvent can be separated from the permanent fluid if the need arises and also to avoid releasing permanent fluid due to volatilization in the event the transformer vessel e.g., tank is ruptured. While the following have been suggested, and in some cases used, as the final fill permanent dielectric fluids, they are less preferred than the relatively high viscosity, high boiling permanent dielectric fluids tetrachlorodiaryl methane with or without trichlorotoluene isomers, freon, halogenated hydrocarbons, tetrachloroethylene, the trichlorobenzene isomers and the tetrachlorobenzene isomers. The trichlorobenzene isomers, the tetrachlorobenzene isomers, and mixtures thereof have high flammability ratings and other physical properties similar to askarel and therefore are preferred amongst the less preferred permanent fluids. The following illustrative examples are presented. Each of the examples represents the actual treatment of actual transformers and the data presented in Table 1 constitutes or is based upon data actually obtained during the treatment of these transformers. In the examples, the following abbreviations have been used. A cycle is the period of time between changes in the coolant. A part of a cycle is a portion of a cycle where the leach rate into the coolant is markedly different from the rate in the earlier or later portion of the cycle. Table 1 gives summary data for six transformers. The transformers for Examples 2, 3 and 4, designated as 460, 461 and 459 respectively, are a bank of three identical Uptegraff transformers of 333 kVA capacity and electrically connected such that the load is equally distributed. Each of these transformers contained about 602 l 159 gallons of mineral oil Exxon Univolt Inhibited oil, transformer grade . They had at one time been askarel filled, and subsequently switched to mineral oil hence contained the residual PCB levels shown in the Table. The transformers for Examples 1, A and 5, designated as 667, 668 and 669 respectively, are a similar bank of three identical transformers of 333 kVA capacity, and similarly connected, but in this case are Westinghouse transformers, and contained about 719 l 190 gallons each of Type A askarel 60 Aroclor 1260 and 40 TCB . These transformers were expected to be about the most difficult to leach. They are spiral wound transformers in which the paper insulation, and hence diffusional path length can be several inches In depth. In contrast, many transformers are of the pancake design in which path lengths will be less than an inch. All six transformers were deenergized, drained, then rinsed and refilled with the coolant as shown in the Table for cycle 1. They were reenergized, and during the leaching cycles they were operated normally. Samples of the fluid were taken periodically for analysis, and Table 1 shows the results of these analyses at the ends of parts of the leach cycles. The Table also shows temperatures of the fluid during the leach cycles. The normal load required of these transformers was far below their rated capacity, and thus the normal temperatures of operation were low 50 C or less . Higher temperatures were achieved by insulating the cooling fins and in some cases wrapping them with heating tapes. Table 2 shows additional detailed data for the later cycles of these transformers, especially those cycles in which L 305 silicone oil was the solvent. In cases where the silicone solvent leached back out TCB or TCB mix, these data also are given in Table 2. While it was recognized that the unexpectedly high leach rate into L 305 would require one or more preparatory L 305 leach cycles, and hence the necessity for a means of separating L 305 and PCB possibly by adsorption, extraction, or chemical means, e.g., as disclosed in U.S. A 4,477,354. it was also realized that this would allow the removal of most of the TCB mix interim solvent from the transformer. Table 2 gives additional detail on the L 305 cycles, including the TCB mix leached back out. Table 2 shows that the final fill of permanent coolant contains only 0.038 TCB or TTCB, whereas the fifth cycle would have contained 4.5 chlorinated compounds. Table 1 shows also that the PCB level in the TCB mix at the end of cycle four was only 351 ppm calculated from 530 on an L 305 basis , while at the beginning of cycle 5 the ratio of PCB to TCB mix eluting Table 2 is 6.06 3375, or the equivalent of 1800 ppm PCB in TCB mix. Thus the high rate could not be explained completely on the basis of residual liquor left from cycle 4. TCB mix with a higher concentration of PCB than the cycle 4 liquor was obviously leaching. It is clear then that having treated the PCB with TCB mix leads to faster leaching by L 305 than would have been expected on the basis of the normal differences in the leachants. Since silicone oil is virtually insoluble in chlorobenzenes which, in turn, are only slightly soluble in the silicone oil, e.g. TCB mix is soluble up to about 28 wt. in L 305 at 25 C , the permeation of the silicone oil into the interstices or pores containing the chlorobenzenes in order to leach the chlorobenzenes or PCB within the pores, must involve an interface. Without being bound by theory, it is hypothesized that two types of mechanisms prevail, i.e. capillary displacement or drainage in those cases where the pore is open at both ends and a diffusional mechanism in those cases, for example, where the pore is open only at one end wherein the chlorobenzene, e.g. PCB and or TCB and or TTCB diffuses into the silicone oil and the interface moves into the pore. The purpose of this example is to illustrate the rate of movement of the interface into a simulated pore. This example utilized an apparatus comprising a glass capillary tube having a 2 mm inside diameter extending downwardly from the bottom of a stoppered glass vessel. The lower end of the capillary was closed off and the upper end opened into the interior of the glass vessel. The capillary tube when 2 3 full held 0.125 cm³ and the glass vessel held about 15 cm³. The capillary tube was marked with a millimeter scale. In each of experiments 1 12, a lower phase as identified in Table 3 was introduced into the capillary tube to fill it about 2 3 full. An upper phase as identified in Table 3 was then placed in the upper third of the capillary tube in the glass vessel. The initial position of the interface between the upper and lower phases was measured and the position of the interface was measured on a daily basis to determine the rate of downward movement of the interface. The rates given in Table 3 for experiments 1 6 were determined over a 35 to 40 day period and the rates given in Table 3 for experiments 7 12 were measured over a 20 day period. It is noted that the ratio of the rate for TCB mix to the rate for Askarel was about 2 regardless of temperature compare experiment 2 and 3 with 7 and 8 with 9 and 10 . The data given in Table 3 also illustrates that the rate at 60 C was about 1.5 times the rate at 40 C and there appears to be no additional commensurate increase at 100 C. Table 3 also shows the rate of penetration of TCB into the silicone oil was greater than the rate of penetration of TCB mix which, in turn, was greater than the rate of penetration of askarel. The results of experiment 6 suggest that back diffusion of TCB from the upper phase back into the lower phase may be responsible for the very low rate of the diffusion found for experiment 6. Back diffusion in experiment 4 would not significantly effect the rate because the lower phase was about 100 TCB whereas in experiment 6 the lower phase contained only 40 TCB. The first conclusion above, i.e., the fact that TCB mix was eluted twice as fast as Askarel by L 305 is the key finding behind the use of the L 305 preparatory leach e.g., Cycle 2 of Example 2 and Cycle 5 of Example 1 . While L 305 may elute Askarel itself slowly, once the latter is diluted with TCB mix, the TCB mix with its contained PCB can be eluted much faster. This permits the final L 305 leach to remove substantially all the TCB mix, and much of the PCB which the TCB mix has itself failed to leach, prior to the final silicone oil fill and reclassification to a non PCB transformer. The present invention is not limited to use in transformers but can be used in the case of any electrical induction apparatus using a dielectric coolant liquid including electromagnets, liquid cooled electric motors, and capacitors, e.g., ballasts employed in fluorescent lights.
