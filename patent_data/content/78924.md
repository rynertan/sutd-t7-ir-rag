# Air lock valve for pneumatic conveying system.

## Abstract
A pneumatic conveying system including an air separ ator chamber having an exhaust fan connected thereto to produce a partial vacuum in such chamber is described. An inlet duct is connected to the chamber through which material is conveyed by air flow into the chamber. The chamber includes an exit section within which material separated by gravity momentum forces collect, such exit section having an air lock valve 16 therein. This valve is arranged such that in its closed position, the pyramid like configuration is inverted with the apex of the pyramid being directed downwardly. The air lock valve 16 includes a plurality of flexible panel means 80 and a support structure operatively connected thereto. Such panel means 801 are between an open position for passage of material through the valve 16 and a closed position. The panel means 80 together define an open sleeve like structure in the open condition of the valve 16 . The panel means 80 are adapted to cooperate with the support structure such that as the flexible panel means 80 move toward the closed position under the influence of a differential in air pressure across the valve 16 , such panel means 80 fold or flex in a predetermined manner such that selected sections of same come into cooperating relationship with one another to define a pyramid like configuration.
