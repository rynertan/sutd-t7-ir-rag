## Description
EXTRACTION OF HALOGENATED HYDROCARBONS FROM AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS USING PHOSPHINE OXIDES ON INERT SUPPORTS AS THE EXTRACTANT The present invention relates to a method for the extraction of halogenated hydrocarbons from aqueous solutions containing them. More particularly, it relates to a method for the extraction of chlorinated aliphatic and aromatic compounds from aqueous solutions using phosphine oxides on inert solid supports as the extractant. Still more particularly, it relates to a method for the removal of halogenated hydrocarbons from the drinking water supply system. A concern among environmental and public health authorities is the significance of potential contamination of the water supply system by halogenated hydrocarbons from industrial processes. Some investigations have expressed a particular concern for the drinking water supply because some halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g., PCB s polychlorinated biphenyls , are fat soluble and, over time, may present a serious health problem. At present there is no readily available, economical method for removing these compounds from aqueous solutions. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for the removal, by extraction, of halogenated hydrocarbons, particularly chlorinated hydrocarbons, from aqueous solutions, which comprises contacting an aqueous solution containing them with a phosphine oxide compound alone or supported on a solid, inert carrier material, hereinafter also referred to as the support. Phosphine oxides which are useful in accordance with the present invention are those represented by the formula R3 P O wherein R represents, individually, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl and substituted aralky. Preferred alkyls included about C6 to about C18 straight and branched chain alkyls while preferred cycloalkyls include six carbon to eight carbon substituted and unsubstituted cycloalkyls. Examples of suitable phosphine oxides include, but are not limited to, tri n hexylphosphine oxide THPO , tri noctyl phosphine oxide TOPO , tris 2,4,4 trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide, tricyclohexylphosphine oxide, tri n dodecylphosphine oxide, tri n octadecylphosphine oxide, tris 2ethylhexyl phosphine oxide, di n octylethylphosphine oxide, di n hexylisobutylphosphine oxide, octyldiisobutylphosphine oxide, tribenzylphosphine oxide, di n hexylbenzylphosphine oxide, di n octylbenzylphosphine oxide, 9 octyl 9 phospha bicyclo 3.3.1 nonane 9 oxide, and the like, and mixtures thereof. TOPO and THPO are preferred, singly or in mixtures. Halogenated hydrocarbons which are subject to extraction from aqueous solutions by present process of the invention include, but are not limited to, aliphatic and aromatic halogenated hydrocarbons, represented by the following types CX4, CX3CX3, CX2 CX2, wherein X represents hydrogen or a halogen atom, provided at least one X is a halogen atom compounds represented by the formula EMI2.1 wherein X represents a halogen atom and n is an integer from 1 to 6 and compounds represented by the formula EMI2.2 wherein X represents a halogen atom and n is an integer from 1 to 5. Representative examples of halogenated hydrocarbons which are extracted from aqueous solutions according to the method of the present invention include, but are not limited to, dichloromethane, dibromomethane, trichloromethane, tribromomethane, bromoethane, bromopropane, l,l,l trichloroethane, l,l,2 trichloroethane, tetrachloromethane, 1,1,1tribromoethane, 1 ,l,2 tribromoethane, 1,1,2 trichloroethylene, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethylene, 1,2 dibromoethane, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, o dichlorobenzene, o dibromobenzene, m dichlorobenzene, p dichlorobenzene, chlorinated biphenyls, brominated biphenyls, chlorinated naphthalenes, and the like, and mixtures thereof, and corresponding fluoro and iodo compounds. While the phosphine oxide may be used alone, especially if it is in the form of a solid or semi solid, it is particularly more convenient if it is supported on a solid carrier or support. While in general the support will be inert, the present invention is not limited to inert supports and chemically active supports may be used where it is desired to extract materials unextractable by the phosphine oxide. The solid materials or supports for the phosphine oxide extractants of the present invention are preferably waterinsoluble absorbents and include, but are not limited to, such materials as diatomaceous earth, silica, wide pore carbon, and the like, or crosslinked polymeric materials in the form of porous beads. Synthetic macroporous, crosslinked copolymers of styrene and divinyl benzene are commonly used support materials. Other commonly used supports are, for example, divinylbenzene crosslinked polyacrylates and polymethacrylates. These supports themselves are generally not critical and a convenient support amenable to a particular application may easily be determined by one skilled in the art with simple experimentation. Many monovinyl compounds monomers can bed used alone or combined in the preparation of the polymeric supports useful in the present invention. They include, but are not limited to, styrene, methylstyrene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylonitrile, vinyl anisole, vinyl naphthalene acrylic and methacrylic acid esters, such as methyl , ethyl , propyl , isopropyl , butyl , isobutyl , tert.butyl , ethylhexyl , cyclohexyl , benzyl , phenyl , ethoxymethyl , propoxymethyl , propoxypropyl , ethoxyphenyl , ethoxybenzyl , ethoxycyclohexyl , methoxycyclohexyl acrylates and methacrylates alkylphenyl acrylates and methacrylates ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, diisobutylene vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, and the like.Polyethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene, which behave as if they had only a simple double bond, are also suitable. Suitable polyvinyl compounds which function as crosslinking agents include, but are not limited to, divinylbenzene, divinylpyridine, divinyltoluene, divinylnaphthalene, diallyl phthalate, ethyleneglycol diacrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, divinylxylene, divinylethylbenzene, divinylsulfone, polyvinyl or polyallyl ethers of glycols, glycerine and pentaerythritol, divinylketone, divinyl sulfide, allylacrylate, diallylmaleate, diallylfumarate, diallyl succinate, diallyl carbonate, diallyl malonate, diallyl oxalate, diallyl adipate, diallyl sebacate, divinyl sebacate, diallyl silicate, triallyl phosphate, N,N methylenediacrylamide,N,N methylenedimethacrylamide, N,N ethylenediacrylamide, trivinylvenzene, trivinylnaphthalene, and the like. The amount of polyvinyl compound used may vary over wide limits. In general, however, the polyvinyl compound is used in an amount ranging from about 5 to 70 by weight, based on the total weight of monomers, and preferably between about 8 and 60 by weight. The phosphine oxide extractant compound may be incorporated in or on the support material by any convenient technique. Conventional and applicable techniques include, but are not limited to, impregnation, with the aid of a solvent, or by encapsulation, through the addition of the extractant to the monomer mixture, adding a polymerization catalyst, and then polymerizing the resulting mixture or solution of monomers in the presence of the extractant by conventional techniques. A procedure for the encapsulation of extractants via this technique is described by Krobel et al, U.S. Patent 3,960,762. In addition to the polymeric cross linked macroporous polymers described above, the present invention may utilize as the polymeric support material crosslinked macroporous copolymers containing phosphine oxide functions directly bonded to the polymer backbone. An example of such a polymer is a copolymer of styrene, chloromethyl styrene and divinylbenzene or a copolymer of p chloromethyl styrene and divinylbenzene wherein the chloromethyl group is reacted with a secondary phosphine oxide, e.g., dioctylphosphine oxide see, for example, European Patent Application 0031761 to Bolleau et al. Similar polymers are described by McKinley et al, U.S. Patent 3,708,462. Alternatively, certain crystalline phosphine oxides, such as tribenzylphosphine oxide, may be used alone, or mixed with an inert solid material, as a support for extraction of halocarbons. Thus, a solution containing halocarbons to be extracted may be slurried with the solid phosphine oxide or passed through a column packed with the solid phosphine oxide or a mixture thereof with an inert solid material. The amount of phosphine oxide incorporated in or on the support material by impregnation or encapsulation, or by the use of polymers containing phosphine oxide groups, or by the use of crystalline phosphine oxides alone, may vary over wide limits, provided sufficient phosphine oxide is available to extract the halocarbons from solutions containing them.Ordinarily, the need for efficiency of extraction will determine the amount of phosphine oxide extractant used and these levels can easily be determined by one skilled in the art with simple experimentation. The following examples are provided by way of illustration and are in no way limiting of the scope of the invention which is capable of wide variance and application within the scope of the claims that follow.

Example 7 Extension of Scope to Other Halocarbons Tables 7A to 7C as follows are compilations of the extractions of a mixture of aqueous octafluoronaphthalene, trichloroethylene, 1,2 dibromoethane, and iodomethane with three supported columns 7A blank diatomaceous earth 7B 30 weight percent impregnated TOPO on diatomaceous earth and 7C 30 weight percent TPPO impregnated on diatomaceous earth. By 47 ml of effluent through the blank column, a break through of all four halogen compounds has occurred.By 144 mls, the effluent flow concentration is virtually the same as the feed. The TPPO column shows a break through for three of the halogenohydrocarbons, excepting the fluoro , by 30 ml of effluent. The fluoro compound breaks through between 56 and 107 ml effluent. Thus, the TPPO column shows similar low extraction activity to the blank column for chloro , bromo , and iodo components. Activity is found, however, for the fluoro compound. The TOPO column shows substantial activity for the fluoro and chloro compounds with extraction occurring at 246 ml effluent. Good extraction of the bromo compound is demonstrated since the break through is evidenced at 140 ml 3.7 ppm . The 140 ml volume is considerably more than 47 ml break through 22 ppm by the TPPO column. Iodomethane is extracted to a lesser extent than in the case of the other halogens, Some extraction has occurred with the TOPO column as the break through shows between 43 and 93 mls. The blank and TPPO columns have broken through by 47 and 30 ml, respectively. This example makes it clear that specific extraction profiles could easily be obtained by proper selection of particular oxides and mixtures thereof which selection and combination should easily be determined by simple experimentation.

Hollow Macroporous Styrene Divinylbenzene Copolymer 15 crosslinking . A solution of 72.75 grams of styrene, 27.25 grams of divinylbenzene 55 , the remainder being polymerizable monomers , 1.0 gram of azobixisobutyronitrile and 43 grams of toluene was added to a solution of 2 grams of the ammonium salt of a styrene maleic anhydride polymer. The mixture was stirred under nitrogen for 15 hours at 800C, the resulting beads were filtered, washed with water and dried at 7200. B. Macroporous Styrene Divinylbenzene Copolymer Containing Encapsulated Tri n Octylphosphine Oxide. The procedure of A was followed except that 43 grams of tri n octylphosphine oxide was used in place of toluene. The resulting polymer beads contained 30 phosphine oxide.C.

I A solution of 30 grams of p chloromethyl styrene, 14 grams of styrene, 6 grams of divinylbenzene 55 , 0.55 gram of azobisisobutyronitrile and 50 grams of toluene was added to a solution of 1 gram of poly vinylpyrrolidone in 400 grams of water. The mixture was stirred at 8000 under nitrogen for 19 hours and the resulting beads were isolated, washed with water and dried at 7200. The polymer beads 10 grams were suspended in 30 ml of dimethyl formamide to which was added 2.5 grams of potassium hydroxide, 3 grams of methanol and 38 grams of dimethyl formamide. Di n hexylphosphine oxide 10 grams and 0.4 gram of potassium hydroxide were added and the mixture was stirred under nitrogen for 18 hours. The resulting beads were filtered, washed with water and dried. The beads contained 1.16 P. II. Following the procedure of I except that 8.75 grams of dicyclohexylphosphine oxide was used instead of 10 grams of di n hexylphosphine oxide, beads were obtained containing 0.92 P. Columns were separately prepared containing 10 grams of the polymers of A and B and 9.5 grams of the polymer of C, which consisted of 3.9 grams I 6.4 grams II which had 1.01 P. Table 8 shows the extraction of high concentrations of chloroform in water 244 310 ppm by the several extractants. The hollow beads polymer A exhibited modest activity, but poor loading, i.e., after 1185 ml of the 244 ppm solution of chloroform was passed through the column, only 0.002 gram per gram of resin was extracted. Polymer B, containing 30 encapsulatedTOPO, shows substantial activity, having extracted 0.0292 gram per gram of resin from 1136 ml of 310 ppm chloroform solution, or 14.6 times the loading ofPolymer A. The phosphorus bound polymer also exhibits good loading, having extracted 0.0093 grams per gram of resin from 1144 ml of 275 ppm chloroform solution or 4.6 times the loading of Polymer A.
