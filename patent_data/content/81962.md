# DENTURE CLEANSING COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A rapidly disintegrating tablet form of a stable effective and highly effervescent chlorineyielding denture cleansing composition reactive under aqueous conditions is obtained by utilizing a combination of an oxygen yielding perborate with a hypochlorite yielded chloroisocyanurate, when a substantial proportion of the total oxygenyielding perborate in the denture cleansing composition is present in an anhydrous form. The cleansing composition also includes alkaline agents which provide a pH of about 11 in the aqueous medium in which the tablets are normally dissolved.
