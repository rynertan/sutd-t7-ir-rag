# Air circuit breaker.

## Abstract
The disclosure describes an air circuit breaker compris ing, in combination, a rotational shaft 104 connected with a motor, a cam 113 which rotates in one direction through a ratchet 112 by a handle operation to accumulate pressure in an energy accumulating spring for contact closure, and engaging part 122 provided on the outer periphery of the rotational shaft, and a latch 120 which slides on and along the engaging part 122 of the rotational shaft 104 when the 113 is rotated by said handle operation, and which es the cam 113 to rotate together with the rotational shaft 104 in engagement with the engaging part 122 of the rotational shaft when the rotational shaft is rotated in one and the same direction by the motor driving.
