# Lipid encapsulation process.

## Abstract
An encapsulated lipid material as an animal feedstuff ingredient is prepared by homogenising natural slaughter house blood, essentially free from any anticoagulating agents with lipid material in the molten state containing by weight more than 20 free fatty acids, allowing the resulting dispersion or emulsion to set to a firm gel which will typically occur at a temperature below 50 C and drying the gelled product in equipment in which the gel experiences a tumbling action.
