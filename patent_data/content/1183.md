## Abstract
An up wash, up flow filter has an arrangement to hold the filter media in position during filtering but to allow the media to rise during washing. In order to hold the filter media firmly against the pressure of upward flowing liquid during filtering, an imperforate diaphragm 20 is provided movable between an applied position and a released position by pressurised fluid supplied by an inlet 42 located above the diaphragm. The filter housing 12 is flared upwardly and outwardly to allow a greater range of sizes of filter media.
