## Description
CERAMIC MATERIALS FROM SILAZANE POLYMERS This invention relates to the preparation of ceramic materials from silazane polymers with increased ceramic yields. The ceramic materials of this invention are obtained by firing a mixture of a R3SiNH containing silazane polymer and certain boron compounds to an elevated temperature in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. The boron compound additives allow for the formation of ceramic materials with increased ceramic yield. Ceramic materials prepared from R3SiNH containing silazane polymers are known in the art.

What is newly discovered is that certain boron compounds when added to R3SiNH containing silazane polymers prior to firing at elevated temperatures, allow for the formation of ceramic materials with a significant increase in ceramic yield relative to ceramic materials fired under the same conditions without the additives.

This invention also relates to a method of preparing a ceramic material with increased ceramic yield, said method comprising heating a modified R3SiNH containing silazane polymer in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum to a temperature of at least 7500C until said modifiedR3SiNH containing silazane polymer is converted to a ceramic material with increased ceramic yield relative to a non modified R3SiNH containing silazane polymer heated under the same conditions, wherein said modified R3SiNH containing silazane polymer is prepared by mixing the non modifiedR3SiNH containing silazane polymer with an effective, ceramic yield increasing, amount of a boron compound, wherein said non modified R3SiNH containing silazane polymer is prepared by contacting and reacting in an inert, essentially anhydrous atmosphere, an organochlorosilane or a mixture of organochlorosilanes of general formula R S iCl n 4 n with a disilazane of general formula R3Si 2NH at a temperature in the range of 250C to 3000C while distilling by produced volatile products, wherein R is a vinyl group, an alkyl group of 1 3 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group R is a hydrogen atom, a vinyl group, an alkyl group of 1 3 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group and n has a value of 1 or 2. This invention further relates to a method of preparing a ceramic material with increased ceramic yield1 said method comprising heating a modified R3SiNH containing silazane polymer in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum to a temperature of at least 7500C until said modifiedR3SiNH containing silazane polymer is converted to a ceramic material with increased ceramic yield relative to a non modified R3SiNH containing silazane polymer heated under the same conditions, wherein said modified R3SiNH containing silazane polymer is prepared by mixing the non modifiedR3 SiNH containing silazane polymer with an effective, ceramic yield increasing, amount of a boron compound, wherein said non modified R3SiNH containing silazane polymer is prepared by contacting and reacting in an inert, essentially anhydrous atmosphere, trichlorosilane with a disilazane at a temperature in the range of 250C to 3000C while distilling by produced volatile products, wherein said disilazane has the general formula R3Si 2NH where R is a hydrogen atom, a vinyl group, an alkyl group containing 1 3 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group. Ceramic yield, as employed in this present specification, is the percentage yield of the ceramic product upon firing a modified or non modifiedR3SiNH containing silazane polymer to an elevated temperature under an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum until the modified or non modified R3SiNH containing silazane polymer is converted to a ceramic material. The ceramic yield is calculated by dividing the weight of the ceramic product obtained by the initial weight of the modified or non modified R3SiNH containing silazane polymer and then multiplying the result by 100. A correction for the amount of added boron compound is not made. The process of this invention is carried out by first mixing a R3SiNH containing silazane polymer with an effective amount of a boron compound and then firing the resulting mixture to an elevated temperature under an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum until the resulting mixture is converted to a ceramic material. By boron compounds , we mean both the finely divided metal as well as various inorganic compounds incorporating the metal atom. The boron compounds should be either a liquid or a solid at room temperature. By room temperature we mean a temperature of about 250C. Suitable boron compounds include metaboric acid HBO2 , orthoboric acid H3BO3 , tetraboric acid H2B407 , boron oxide B203 , boron silicide B6Si and B3Si , tributoxyborine B OC4Hn9 3 triethoxyborine B OC2H5 3 , triisopropoxyborine B OC3H7 3 , trimethoxyborine B OCH3 3 , tripropoxylborine B OC3Hn7 3 , triisoamylborate B OCH2CH2CH CH3 2 3 dimethyl methoxy borine CH30B CH3 2 , triethylborine B C2H5 3 , triisobutylborine B C4H 3 , trimethylborine B CH3 3 , tripropylborine B C3H7 3, triphenylborine B C6H5 3 , and the like. Suitable organoboron compounds may be described by the general formula BR3 where R is selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms, phenyl radical, and OR radicals where R is an alkyl radical containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferred boron compounds include metaboric acid, orthoboric acid, and trimethoxyborine. As one skilled in the art would realize, not all combinations of R3SiNH containing silazane polymers, the just listed boron compounds, and pyrolysis conditions will lead to ceramic material with increased ceramic yield.Routine experimentation may be required in some cases to determine if an increase in ceramic yield is actually realized. Cases where such an increase in ceramic yield is not realized are not, naturally, considered to be within the scope of this invention. The method of mixing the R3SiNH containing silazane polymer and the boron compound is not critical. It is preferred that the silazane polymer and the boron compound be well mixed to help insure that the ceramic yield does not vary significantly throughout the ceramic material or article. Using an organic solvent such as toluene for the mixing medium helps to insure that the components will be well mixed. Other mixing techniques may be used. The R3SiNH containing silazane polymer is mixed with an effective amount of a boron compound. By an effective amount of the boron compound, I mean that amount which results in an increased ceramic yield in the resulting ceramic material. Generally, the boron compound is added at such a level so as to obtain a mixture containing theR3SiNH containing silazane polymer and 0.1 to 2.0 weight percent of boron. The boron compound may be added at higher levels although no added benefits may result. It is preferred that the boron compound be present at a level equivalent to about 0.5 to 1.5 weight percent boron.The increase in ceramic yield of the ceramic material prepared by the method of this invention is determined by comparison with the ceramic yield of a ceramic material obtained by firing the same R3SiNH containing silazane polymers, without the added boron compounds, under the same experimental conditions. The mixture of R3SiNH containing silazane polymer and an effective amount of a boron compound is fired to an elevated temperature of at least 7500C under an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum until the mixture is converted to a ceramic material. Although not wishing to be held to such a theory, we believe that the boron compound additives of this invention interact with the R3SiNH containing silazane during the early stages of the pyrolysis step. The interaction may be in the form of crosslinking or the promotion of cross linking of potentially volatile species from the R3SiNH containing silazane polymer. By keeping the potential volatile material in the system, more carbon, nitrogen, and silicon are available for conversion to ceramic in the latter stages of the pyrolysis step. It is expected that the boron compounds will be reduced to boron during the pyrolysis. Silazane polymers suitable for use in the present invention are R3SiNH containing silazane polymers. R3SiNHcontaining silazane polymers especially useful in this invention are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,312,970 and 4,340,619 and U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 555,755 filed November 28, 1983. The silazane polymers described in U.S. PatentNo. 4,312,970 are prepared by contacting and reacting in an inert, essentially anhydrous, atmosphere, an organochlorosilane or a mixture of organochlorosilanes of the general formula RnSiCl 4 n with a disilazane having the general formula R3Si 2NH at a temperature in the range of 250C to 3000C while distilling by produced volatile products, wherein R is a vinyl group, an alkyl group of 1 3 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group R is a hydrogen atom, a vinyl group, an alkyl group of 1 3 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group and n has a value of 1 or 2. The organochloromonosilanes of PatentNo. 4,312,970 are those having the general formula R S iCl n 4 n where R is vinyl or an alkyl radical containing 1 3 carbon atoms or the phenyl group. Thus, those groups which are contemplated as being useful in this invention are methyl, ethyl, propyl, vinyl and phenyl. The R groups can all be the same or they can be different. The organochloromonosilanes are common commodity chemicals and are commercially available. The value of n is 1 or 2. Thus, single organic group substituted silanes, such as CH3SiC13, C6H5SiC13,CH2 CHSiC13, CH3CH2SiC13 or CH3 CH2 2SiC13, double organic group substituted silanes, such as CH3 2SiC12, C2H5 2SiC12 and CH2 CH CH3 SiC12, and mixtures of such silanes, for example, CH3SiC13 and CH3 2SiC12, can be used. It is preferred that when organochlorosilane mixtures are used, the number of units of diorgano substituted silicon atoms should not exceed the number of units of monoorganosubstituted silicon atoms. The silazane polymers of U.S. PatentNo. 4,340,619, which are the preferred silazane polymers for the practice of this invention, are prepared by contacting and reacting in an inert, essentially anhydrous, atmosphere, a chlorine containing disilane or a mixture of chlorinecontaining disilanes, of the general formula ClbR ski 2 with a disilazane having the general formula R3Si 2NH at a temperature in the range of 250C to 3000C while distilling by produced volatile products, wherein R is a vinyl group, an alkyl group of 1 3 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group R is a hydrogen atom, a vinyl group, an alkyl group of 1 3 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group b has a value of 0.5 3 c has a value of 0 2.5 and the sum of b c is equal to three. The chlorine containing disilanes of U.S. PatentNo. 4,340,619 are those disilanes having the general formula ClbRc Si 2 where R is vinyl, an alkyl radical containing 1 3 carbon atoms or the phenyl group. Thus, the R groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, vinyl and phenyl. The R groups can all be the same or they can be different. The chlorine containing disilanes can be those found in the residue from the DirectProcess for producing halosilanes Eaborn, C., Organosilicon Compounds , Butterworth Scientific Publications,London, 1960, pg. 1 . The Direct Process is the reaction between silicon metal and aliphatic halides, generally methyl chloride, at elevated temperature in the presence of catalyst, generally copper, to produce chlorosilanes. For the chlorine containing disilanes described above, the value of b and c is from 0.5 3 and 0 2.5, respectively, and the sum of b c is equal to three.Examples of chlorine containing disilanes are Cl CH3 2Si 2, Cl2CH3Si 2, C12C2H5Si 2, tCl C6H5 25i 2, and C12CH2 CHSi 2. Monosilanes can also be used in admixtures with the above described chlorine containing disilanes. Examples include CH3SiC13, CH3 2SiC12, H CH3 2SiCl, CH3 3SiCl, CH2 CH CH3 2SiCl, C2H5 2SiC12, C6H5SiC13, as well as C6H5 2SiCl2, and C6H5 3sicl. When polysilazane polymers are prepared in accordance with U.S. Patent No. 4,340,619 for use in this invention it is preferred that mixtures of chlorinecontaining disilanes be employed where the number of units of diorgano substituted silicon atoms does not exceed the number of units of monoorgano substituted silicon atoms. The silazane polymers of Application Serial Number 555,755 are prepared by contacting and reacting in an inert, essentially anhydrous atmosphere, trichlorosilane with a disilazane at a temperature in the range of 250C to 3000C while removing by produced volatile products, wherein said disilazane has the general formula R3Si 2NH where R is selected from the group consisting of vinyl, hydrogen, phenyl, and alkyl radicals containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms. It appears that some component, possibly a hydrolysis product, in aged trichlorosilane is detrimental in the preparation of this R3SiNH containing silazane polymer. Such contaminated trichlorosilane can be suitably purified by distillation. Other purification methods may also be employed. It is also preferred that the reactants be added in such a manner that the initial reaction exotherm is kept to a minimum.One reactant may be added slowly to the other reactant, or the added reactant may be cooled, or the reaction vessel may be cooled to keep the reaction exotherm low. Other methods or combination of methods may also be used. In general, it is preferred that the reaction be controlled such that the initial reaction temperature due to the exotherm is less than about 500C, and most preferably, less than 350C. In general, more reproducible results are obtained when purified trichlorosilane is used and when the initial reaction exotherm is controlled carefully. The second reactant in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,312,970 and 4,340,619 and Application Serial Number 555,755 is a disilazane of the general formula R3Si 2NH. R in this formula is vinyl, hydrogen, an alkyl radical of 1 3 carbon atoms or the phenyl group. Therefore, R, for purposes of this formula is represented by hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, vinyl and phenyl. Each R group in this formula can be the same or they can be different. Examples of the disilazanes include CH3 Si 2NH, C6H5 CH3 2Si 2NH, C6H5 2CH3Si 2NH, CH2 CH CH3 2Si 2NH, CH2 CH CH3 C6H5Si 2NH, CH2 CH C6H5 2Si 2NH, CH2 CH C2H5 25i 2NH, H CH3 2Si 2NH, and CH2 CH C6H5 C2H5Si 2NH. These reactants are brought together in an inert, essentially anhydrous atmosphere. By inert , we mean that the reaction is carried out under a blanket of inert gas, such as argon, nitrogen, or helium. What we mean by essentially anhydrous is that the reaction is preferably carried out in an absolutely anhydrous atmosphere but minute amounts of moisture can be tolerated. When the reactants are contacted with each other, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,312,970 and 4,340,619 andApplication Serial Number 555,755, the reaction begins which forms an intermediate amino compound. Upon heating, additional amino compound is formed and upon continued heating, R3SiCl is distilled from the reaction mixture and a silazane polymer is formed. The order of addition of the materials does not appear to be critical. As the temperature is raised higher, more condensation takes place and crosslinking occurs with residual R3Si that is not distilled from the mixture acting as a chain stopper. This control allows one to stop the reaction at any point to obtain almost any desired viscosity. The desirable temperature range for this reaction is 250 to 3000C. A preferred temperature range for this reaction is 1250 3000C.The length of time that the reaction requires depends on the temperature employed and the viscosity one wishes to achieve. What is meant by volatile products are the distillable by produced products that are formed by the reactions set forth above. These materials can be represented by CH3 3SiCl, CH2 CH C6H5 2SiCl, CH3 C6H5 2SiCl, CH3 2C6H5SiCl and CH2 CH CH3 2SiCl. Sometimes, the process requires the use of a vacuum along with the heat in order to remove these materials from the reaction mixture. After the R3SiNH containing silazane polymer and the boron compound are mixed, the mixture is fired to an elevated temperature of at least 7500C until the mixture is converted to a ceramic material. It is generally preferred that the R3SiNH containing silazane polymer and boron compound mixture be vacuum stripped prior to pyrolysis. If the silazane polymer and boron compound mixture is of sufficient viscosity or if it possesses a sufficiently low melt temperature, it can be shaped first and then pyrolyzed to give a silicon nitride containing shaped article such as a fiber. The silazane polymer and boron compound mixture can be filled with ceramic type fillers if desired and then fired to at least 7500C to obtain ceramic materials or ceramic articles. The silazane polymer and boron compound mixtures of this invention can be used in both the filled and unfilled state, depending on the application. Thus, it is contemplated within the scope of this invention to coat substrates with filled and unfilled mixtures and heat the substrates to produce ceramic coated articles. Fillers and adjuvants can be milled on 3 roll mills by simply mixing the polymers and boron compounds of this invention with the fillers and making several passes on the mill. In the alternative, the polymers and boron compounds can be placed in solvents and the fillers and adjuvants can be added thereto and after mixing the solvent can be removed to give the filled polymer mixture. The coating can be carried out by conventional means. The means used depends on the polymer mixture and substrates used and the application one has in mind.Thus, these materials can be brushed, rolled, dipped or sprayed. In the filled state, it is sometimes necessary to trowel the mixture onto the substrate. The silazane polymer and boron compound mixtures of this invention may also be used as an infiltrant with ceramic materials or as a matrix material for composites. Other uses will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of this specification. So that those skilled in the art can better appreciate and understand the invention, the following examples are given. In the examples, the R3SiNH containing silazane polymer and the boron compounds were mixed using the so called wet milling method. The required amount of boron compound was added to a 50 weight percent solution of theR3SiNH containing silazane polymer in dry toluene in a halfpint mill jar. After adding ceramic milling balls, the jar was purged with argon and sealed. The sample was wet milled for 16 hours. Solvent was removed from the modifiedR3SiNH containing silazane by vacuum stripping for three hours at 250C and 3 mm Hg and for one hour at 500C and 2 mmHg. All mixed samples were stored under argon in a dry box until used. All samples were fired in an Astro IndustriesFurnace 1000A water cooled graphite heated model 1000.3060 FP 12 under a helium atmosphere. All samples were fired to 13000C over a 5.6 hour time period, held at 13000C for 12 minutes, and then cooled to room temperature. During firing, the firing temperature was increased to 6000C at a rate of 2.80C min, then increased from 6000C to 8000C at a rate of 3.30C min, then increased from 8000C to 13000C at a rate of 41.70C min, held at 13000C for 12 minutes, and then cooled at a rate of 360C min. In the examples, control samples were subjected to the same treatment i.e., the wet milling mixing procedure as the boron compound containing silazane polymer except that the control samples did not contain the boron compounds. The ceramic yield of control samples that were subjected to the mixing procedure and control samples that were not subjected to the mixing procedure were essentially the same when fired to elevated temperatures under the same pyrolysis conditions.Example 1 A CH3 3SiNH containing silazane polymer prepared by the procedure outlined in U.S. Patent No. 4,340,619 was employed in this example. A mixture of methylchlorodisilanes 26 pounds , consisting of 42.5 weight percent ofCl2 CH3 SiSi CH3 C12, 35.6 weight percent of Cl CH3 2SiSi CH3 C12, 9.5 weight percentCl CH3 2SiSi CH3 2Cl, and 12.4 weight percent of low boiling chlorosilane, and hexamethyldisilazane 42.2 pounds were reacted in a 72 liter stainless steel reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction temperature was raised to 1950C at a rate of 10cumin while volatile by products were removed by distillation. The resulting solid CH3 3SiNH containing silazane polymer had a softening temperature of 680C. A modified CH3 3SiNH containing silazane polymer which contained 1 weight percent boron was prepared by the wet milling technique by mixing 0.57 g orthoboric acid with 9.9 g of the CH3 3SiNH containing silazane polymer in toluene. Several other samples containing 1 weight percent boron from orthoboric acid were also prepared. Another sample was prepared containing 2 weight percent boron where the added boron compound was also orthoboric acid. The samples were fired under a helium atmosphere at 13000C total firing time was 5.6 hours samples were held at 13000C for 12 minutes . The results are presented in TableI.Example 2 Using the same CH3 3SiNH containing silazane polymer of Example 1, a modified CH3 3SiNH containing silazane polymer which contained 1 weight percent boron was prepared. The boron compound used was trimethoxyborine.Samples were fired to 13000C under a helium atmosphere. The results are presented in Table II.Example 3 This example is for comparison purposes only. A 1.0 weight percent boron containing CH3 3SiNH containing silazane polymer was prepared by mixing the silazane polymer of Example 1 and sodium borate Na2B4O7 . The sample was fired to 13000C as before. The modified silazane polymer had a ceramic yield of 52.2 percent as compared to 54.0 percent for the control. This example illustrates that not all combinations of boron compounds, R3SiNH containing silazane polymers, and firing conditions will lead to a ceramic product with an increased ceramic yield.Example 4 This example is included for comparison purposes only. Using the silazane polymer of Example 1, a series of additives were examined to determine their effect on the ceramic yield. The additives were presented at levels corresponding to about 1.0 weight percent of the element.None of the additives significantly increased ceramic yield.The additives are given in Table III.
