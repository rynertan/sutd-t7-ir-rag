# Elevator drive mechanism.

## Abstract
In an electron beam wafer writing vacuum chamber, an elevator drive shaft 98 is air pressure counterbalanced and dampened under varying load and system pressure conditions by applying required air pressure to an appropriate side of a piston 137 moving with the drive shaft. Air pressure counterbalancing load forces minimize the actuating forces required to drive the elevator, substantially minimizing vibratory shock and distortion to the electron beam writing system. This permits electron beam writing on one wafer simultaneously with a load unload operation of a second semiconductor wafer.
