# A method of making complementary metal oxide semiconductor structures.

## Abstract
A very simple process is provided, with reduced proces sing time, for making a CMOS structure using a single polysilicon, or other refractory material, layer which includes forming a thin gate oxide on both N and P type semiconduc tor layers 40, 12 of a common substrate 10 , forming a gate electrode 50, 54 simultaneously on the N type and on the P type layers 40, 12 and selectively implanting an N type impurity to form N source and drain regions 58, 60 in the P type layer 12 . The semiconductor layers are then oxidized to form substantially thicker oxide 66, 68 , such a silicon dioxide, adjacent to the sides of the gate electrode 50 over the P type layer 12 than the thickness of the oxide 70, 72 adjacent to the sides of the gate electrode 54 over the N type layer 40 . Without using a mask, a P type impurity is implanted into the N type layer to form P source and drain regions 78, 80 .
