## Description
TRAPPED CHARGE BIDIRECTIONAL POWER FET Technical Field The invention relates to power switching semiconductors, and more particularly to power MOSFETs metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors , and the like. Backqround and Summary The invention provides improved lateral FET structure for bidirectional power switching, includingAC application. The invention particularly provides enhanced gating capability by means of trapped charge on floating gate electrode means proximate and insulated from a pair of FET channels each conducting current in both directions. Copending Application Serial Numbers 390,719 and 390,479, filed June 21, 1982, disclose AC power FET structure including laterally spaced source regions and channel regions having a common drift region therebetween. Upon application of voltage of either polarity across main terminals connected to the source regions, current flow in either direction is controlled by the potential on gate electrode means proximate the channels.The potential of the gate electrode means produces electric fields of sufficient intensity to invert the conductivity type in the channel regions, enabling bidirectional conduction. A need has arisen in some implementations for producing electric fields from the gate electrode means without having to reference the latter to one of the main AC line terminals when applying gate potential.The present invention addresses and satisfies this need by storing trapped charge on electrically isolated gate electrode means. Charging electrode means is disposed proximate the gate electrode means for charging the latter. Electrical insulation layer means is between the gate electrode means and the first and second channel regions. Electrical insulation layer means is also between the charging electrode means and the gate electrode means, with the latter being charged by carriers tunneling through the last mentioned insulation layer means in response to given polarity potential on the charging electrode means. The AC power FET has an OFF state in the absence of stored trapped charge on the gate electrode means, with the junction between the drift region and one of the channel regions blocking current flow toward one of the source regions, and with the junction between the drift region and the other of the channel regions blocking current flow toward the other of the source regions. Charge is depleted from the gate electrode means by tunneling back through the last mentioned insulation layer means in response to opposite polarity potential on the charging electrode means. Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a schematic sectional view of AC power FET structure constructed in accordance with the invention. Fig. 2 is a schematic sectional view of an alternate embodiment of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a schematic sectional view of another alternate embodiment. Fig. 4 is a schematic sectional view of yet another alternate embodiment. Detailed Description Fig. 1 shows lateral bidirectional power FET structure 2 including a substrate 4 of one conductivity type, such as n type, having a top major surface 6. A top p layer 8 is diffused or grown into the substrate from top major surface 6, followed by ion implantation and or diffusion of an n top layer 10. A plurality of notches 12, 14, 16 and so on, are formed in the substrate from top major surface 6 through n top layer 10 and through p top layer 8 into substrate region 4. These notches may be anisotropically etched, as known in the art C. Hu, wA ParametricStudy of Power MOSFETs , IEEE Electron Device Conference,Paper CH1461 3 79, 0000 0385 IEEE Transactions ElectronDevices, Vol. ED 25, No. 10, October, 1978 and Ammar and Rogers, UMOS Transistors on Silicon , TransactionsIEEE, ED 27, pages 907 914, May, 1980.Alternatively, the notches may be formed by a porous silicon region in accordance with the known anodization technique of passing a fixed current through the localized region in the presence of concentrated hydrogen fluoride to create a structural change in the silicon which remains single crystalline with the substrate but becomes porous. In the case of anisotropic etching, the bottom of the notch is filled with insulative material. In the case of anodization, the substrate is subjected to an oxidizing atmosphere such that the oxygen enters the pores in the porous notched regions and rapidly oxidizes these regions as shown at 18, 20, 22 and so on, which regions are still single crystalline with substrate 4 but substantially nonconductive. Before or after the anodization, the notches are etched down to levels 24, 26, 28 and so on. In notch 12, silicon dioxide insulating layers 30 and 32 are grown along the inner opposing facing surfaces of the notch. First and second gate electrodes 34 and 36 are then formed along the left and right vertical sides of the notch, as by shadow evaporation of conductive material such as aluminum from an angle or low pressure chemical vapor deposition LPCVD of polysilicon. Another insulating oxide layer 38 is provided along the facing sides of the gate electrodes and along the bottom of the upper notch section, as by chemical vapor deposition. A charging electrode 40 is then deposited in the notch and is insulated between the gate electrodes by insulating layer 38. The gating means, including the gate electrodes and the charging electrode, in notches 14 and 16 is comparable. Notch 12 extends from top major surface 6 downwardly through top layers 10 and 8 into substrate region 4. Notch 12 separates top layer 10 into first and second left and right source regions 42 and 44 and extends therebetween. Notch 12 separates top layer 8 into first and second regions 46 and 48 containing left and right channel regions 50 and 52 and extends therebetween. Junction 54 is formed between left source 42 and left channel region 50. Junction 56 is formed between right source region 44 and right channel region 52. The substrate 4 around the notch forms a drain or drift region 58 of the substrate. Junction 60 is formed between drift region 58 and region 46 containing left channel region 50. Junction 62 is formed between drift region 58 and region 48 containing right channel region 52.Main electrode metalization 64 is deposited on top major surface 6 in an etched groove to ohmically contact source region 42 and channel containing region 46.Another main electrode metalization 66 is deposited on top major surface 6 in an etched groove to ohmically contact source region 44 and channel containing region 48. Upon application of given polarity potential to charging electrode 40 via terminal 68 from a voltage source 70, carriers tunnel through insulation layer 38 to left gate electrode 34 to charge the latter. Left gate electrode 34 is electrically floating, and the charge is trapped and stored thereon. When left gate electrode 34 is charged positively with respect to left main electrode 64, electrons in p region 46 are attracted to channel region 50 to invert the conductivity type therein to n type. This allows electron flow from n source region 42 through channel 50 into drift region 58 in substrate 4. If right main electrode 66 is positive with respect to left main electrode 64, current may then flow from p region 48 momentarily across forward biasedPM junction 62 into drift region 58, then through left channel 50 to source region 42 and left main electrode 64. As soon as current starts to flow through theFET, the voltage across main electrodes 66 and 64 starts to drop, which in turn reduces the potential in various regions of the FET, including portion 72 of p layer region 48 adjacent the right FET channel 52. This falling potential causes carrier electron flow into right channel region 52 because portion 72 becomes negative relative to right gate electrode 36, whereby electrons are attracted into right channel region 52 to invert the conductivity thereof to n type, and hence render channel 52 conductive. Forward biased PN junction 62 conducts only momentarily until the second channel 52 turns ON. The main current path through FET 2 is from right main electrode 66 through right source region 44, downwardly through right vertical channel region 52 along the right side of notch 12, then further downwardly into drift region 58 along the right side of the notch, then around the bottom end 74 of notch 12, then upwardly along the left side of notch 12 in drift region 58 of substrate 4, then upwardly through left vertical channel region 50 along the left side of the notch, then through left source region 42 to left main electrode 64. The structure is bidirectional, and thus current may also flow from left main electrode 64 to right main electrode 66 when the right floating gate electrode 36 has a trapped positive charge with respect to right main electrode 66. Electrons in p layer region 48 are attracted into right channel region 52 by right gate electrode 36 to thus invert channel region 52 to n type and hence allow electron flow from n source region 44 through channel 52 into drift region 58 in substrate 4.If left main electrode 64 is positive with respect to right main electrode 66, current then flows from p layer region 46 momentarily across forward biased PN junction 60 until channel 50 turns on. The main current path is from left main electrode 64 through left source 42, through left channel 50, through drift region 58, through right channel 52, through right source 44 to right main electrode 66. Main electrode 66 thus serves as an electron current source when a negative voltage is applied thereto relative to the voltage on main electrode 64, and serves as an anode when a positive voltage is applied thereto relative to the voltage on main electrode 64. The stored trapped charge on floating gate electrodes 34 and 36 is depleted by carrier tunneling back through insulation layer 38 in response to opposite polarity potential on charging electrode 40 as biased by voltage source 76. In the absence of trapped charge on gate electrodes 34 and 36, or for insufficient charge, channel regions 50 and 52 are p type, and device 2 is in a blocking OFF state. Current from left main electrode 64 to right main electrode 66 is blocked by junction 62.Current flow in the other direction from right main electrode 66 to left main electrode 64 is blocked by junction 60. Bidirectional FET 2 may be used to control AC power. Fig. 1 schematically shows a load 78 and a source of AC power 80 connected across main electrodes 64 and 66. When right main electrode 66 is positive with respect to left main electrode 64, as driven by AC source 80, the charge on left gate electrode 34 is positive with respect to negative left main electrode 64 connected to source region 42 and p layer region 46.Hence, channel 50 is inverted to n type and conduction occurs, i.e. current flows from positive right main electrode 66 through right source region 44, through right channel 52, through drift region 58 around the bottom 74 of notch 12 in substrate 4, through left channel 50, through left source 42 to negative left main electrode 64 and through load 78. In the other half cycle of the AC source 80, left main electrode 64 is positive with respect to right main electrode 66, and the charge on right gate electrode 36 is positive with respect to negative right main electrode 66 connected to source 44 and p layer region 48. Conduction is thus enabled through channel 52, and current flows from positive left main electrode 64 through left source 42, through left channel 50, through drift region 58 around the bottom of the notch, through right channel 52, to right source 44 and right negative main electrode 66. The current path between the main electrodes extends from each source region downwardly through the channel regions and downwardly and around the bottom 74 of the notch. This increases the drift region current path length and affords higher OFF state voltage blocking capability without increasing the lateral dimension along top major surface 6, whereby to afford high density, high voltage bidirectional FET structure with relatively low ON state resistance. As seen in Fig. 1, a plurality of FETs are afforded in the integrated structure. Top layers 10 and 8 are further split into respective left and right source regions and channel regions by respective notches 14 and 16. Main electrode metalizations are provided comparably to that described, and connected in series in the AC load line, or in parallel as shown in Fig. 1.Respective floating gate electrodes are charged from respective charging electrodes connected in parallel via terminal 68. Main electrode 66 provides the source electrode for the FET to the left around notch 12, and also provides the source electrode for the FET to the right around notch 14. Main electrode 82 provides the drain electrode for the FET around notch 14, and also provides the drain electrode for the FET around notch 16. In the other half cycle of AC source 80, the roles of electrodes 66 and 82 are reversed, i.e. electrode 66 is the drain for its left and right FETs around respective notches 12 and 14, and electrode 82 is the source for its left and right FETs around respective notches 14 and 16. Alternate main electrodes 64, 82 and so on, are thus connected to one side of the AC source, and the other alternate main electrodes 66, 84 and so on, are connected to the other side of the AC source. There are numerous alternative structures to that in Fig. 1. While a split gate structure is preferred affording a separate gate electrode for each channel, a single gate electrode 102 may be used, as shown in Fig. 2, where like reference numerals as Fig. 1 are used with the postscripts flaN where appropriate to facilitate clarity. In another alternative, Fig. 2, main electrode 66a may extend downwardly through the top n layer and also through the top p layer into substrate 4a, and include a p layer 104 therealong forming a junction 106 with substrate 4a. In another alternative, as shown in Fig. 3 using like reference numerals as Fig. 1 with the postscript b where appropriate to facilitate clarity, instead of each main electrode such as 66 extending downwardly from top major surface 6, main electrode 66b may be disposed on top of surface 6b and contact spaced n diffused tub regions 44b and 108b corresponding to regions 44 and 108 of Fig. 1. In a further alternative,Fig. 3, the notch means may be provided by two notches 110 and 112, each notch having gate electrode and charging electrode structure like that shown in Fig. 2. Left gate electrode 114 is charged from left charging electrode 116, and right gate electrode 118 is charged from charging electrode 120 which may be connected to charging electrode 116 or supplied separately.The current path through drift region 58b extends around the bottoms of both notches 110 and 112 between channels 50b and 52b In another alternative, as shown in Fig. 4 using like reference numerals as Fig. 1 with the postscript c where appropriate to facilitate clarity, lateral channels 50c and 52c are provided instead of the vertical channels 50 and 52. For each of the lateral and vertical channel embodiments, the insulative regions such as 18c may be eliminated. For lateral channel versions, such as Fig. 4, the notches such as 12 may be eliminated. If notch means is used in a lateral channel version with vertical gate electrodes, the gate electrodes also include portions extending horizontally along top major surface 6c insulated above channels 50c and 52c. Split gate electrode means is preferred, though a single gate may be used extending across both channels, either with a notch and having vertical channels, or without a notch and having horizontal channels. It is recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the appended claims.
