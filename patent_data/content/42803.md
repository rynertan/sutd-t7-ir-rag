# Non aqueous cell using a cathode comprising the reaction product of bismuth trioxide and molybdenum trioxide and an electrolyte based on 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone.

## Abstract
The present invention deals with a cathode comprising the reaction product of bismuth trioxide and molybdenum trioxide. This solid cathode material comprising the thermal reaction product of bismuth trioxide and molybdenum trioxide is for use in nonaqueous electrochemical cell systems using active metal anodes, such as lithium, and organic electrolytes, such as electrolytes based on 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone in conjunction with a cosolvent and a selected solute. The curve of discharge of the cell is relatively flat as shown in the enclosed figure 1.
