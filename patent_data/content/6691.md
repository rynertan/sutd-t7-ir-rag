# Object identification system.

## Abstract
An object identification system has a transmitter 8 supplying a signal M13 from an inductor 3 of a trans mitter 8 by low loss near field coupling to an inductor 1 of a transponder 5 on the object to be identified. The energy of this signal M13 is stored in a capacitor 6 and re radiated by the inductor 1 , at a reduced frequency formed in effect by cancellation of part of the incoming wave, to an inductor 2 of a receiver 7 as a reply signal M12 . The reduction in frequency is achieved by a switching system in the transponder 5 which is controlled by a control signal P1 from a control circuit 4 . This control circuit may be powered by energy P2 from the inductor 1 . The switching is performed by a FET TR1 and occurs at suitable points in the operating cycle to ensure the minimum energy loss. The operation of switching is coded in code generator 20 to produce a desired reply signal M12 carrying information about the object to be identified.

## Description
OBJECT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM The present invention relates to object identification systems wherein a transmitting means called the interrogator is coupldd to an identification means called the transponder which is attached to or associated with the object to be identified, and which generates a reply signal which is coupled to a receiving means from which useful inforrnation about the object is extracted. In one known system microwave signals are used, the transponder extracting power from the interrogator at one frequency and subsequently reradiating power at another frequency, the reradiated signal heinq detected and used as the identification means.

This ue inv l in the transponder a seceiving atena f delay line, liom wimen the outp s r arned to a reply d n two port ransponder , or returned t er s l n s one port system , for radiation to the recoiv n n . In this system difficulties are encountered with the delay line length when leng code re u red to l generated. Furt elmore, because the reply signals from this type or transposder are weak, complex signal processing is necessary to extract the reply signal from noise. The acoustic surface wave system also has the isa vantage that, at the most suitable frequeneles for its operation, unconfaned radiation of high power signals is not pormitted.In yet another system the principle of inductive couplimt is explo ted for object identificntion. The transponder is passive electionl device having two uncoup ed antennas. When a signal is received from the interro atang source the received energy is converted to de which provi es a power source from which the coradiated signal is generated. The transponders avallaple in this catogory omploy nearfield electromagnetic coupling and are of the two port type in which the interrogation signal is teceived one port and the modulated reply signal is transmitied from the second port.An inherent problem associated with such systems lies in their need for two unconpled antonnas requiring additional space on the transponder, which in practical applications is normally desired to be small. Surtin tmore, for the kind of circuit used for coupling, the bandwidth which must be provided is determined by the information rate required in the reply signal while for near field antennas the strength of the electromagnetic coupling between the transponder and the interregator is proportional to the quality factor. The well known inverse relationship between quality factor and bandwidth therefore provides unwelcome constraints on the performance of the overall system. Tltese systents have the further disadvantage that the energy available for generating the reply signal has been attenuated by the losses involved in conversion of the interrogation signal energy first to dc and then reconversion of this energy to the frequency of tile reply signal. Moreover the forward voltage drop provided by commonly available semi conductor dioces involved in conversion to dc places a lower limit on threshold of operation. A variation of the above technique couid be designed to use a duplexer to eliminate the need for a second antenna however the duplexer introduces further losses and imposes limitations on the bandwidth of the system. Specific prior art patent specifications areBritish Patent No, 1,187,830 hy P .essey Limited,United States Patent No. . 3,229,424 by Jorgen P.Vinding, and United states Patent No. 3,964,024 byHutton and Kramer, which specifications will be referred to later in this specification. An object of the present invention is to provide a system for object identification whereby the transforniation of energy from a first frequency to a second frequency is carried out with substantially no energy loss and in which the modulation of the r eply signal can be carried out without any dissipation of energy and at a rate which is not limited by tioe bandwidth of the resonant circuit containing the transponder, near field coupling element or antenna hereinafter generally referred to as the coupling element . A further object is to avoid the need to convert the received power used for generation of the reply to de and thereby to achieve efficient operation at low power level. A still further object is to simplify the coupling elements used for the reception of energizing power and reradiation of the reply signal. A still further object is to devise an object identification system providing a coded reply in which high quality tuned circuits can be exploited to enhance the transfer of power across the electromagnetic coupling links. A still further object of the invention is to provide a means for implementing any one of the modulation methods such as Amplitude Shift Keying ASK , Phase Shift Keying PSK , Frequency ShiftKeying RSK Iid Pulse Code Modulation PCM whereby the information bandwidth is not lintited bj the quality factor of the tuned circuit. A still further object of the invention is to provide a control means whereby the switching instants for the generation of the second frequency can be established. The present invention recognizes that power transfer in the electromagnetic propagation paths at two fre luencies are independent and as a conse quench there must be a fundamental component of current in the transponder coupling element in order to extract power from the applied field at the fundamental frequency created by the interrogation signal, and there must also be a second frequency component of current in the transponder coupling element in order to radiate the reply signal. The invention provides these necessary frequency components in a uniquely efficient way.The invention further recognizes the fact that efficient power transfer between near field coupling elements proceeds when these coupling elements are reactive energy storage elements resonated with high quality factor b reactive energy storage elements of the complementary type. Til. system according to the present invention requires iri the transponder at least one coupling eletnent used t.or simultaioeous extraction of power from the transmitting source at one frequency and its subsequent reradiation at another frequency. The reply signal energy is not injected into the coupling element from a dc reservoir as in the prior art but rather it is synthesized, without prior conversion to dc, by switches and control elements which operate at appropriate instances of time to modulate the energy exchange process between the transponder near field coupling element and its complementary energy storage element with which it is resonated. Thus the invention comprises an object identification system wherein energy is transferred from a transmitter to a transponder by near field coupling either capacitive or inductive to firstly establish an oscillation in a tuned circuit and switching to produce a sub harmonic or multiple thereof whereby a receiver tuned to the sub harmonic or a multiple thereof detects this frequency generated in the transponder, and secondly varying the switching pattern so that the reply signal becomes modulated with an information bearing code. An important characteristic of our invention is that the etiergy which provides the reply signal is not derived by first converting the received power to dc, although some conversion to dc for control purposes may be effected. In our invention, the reply signal is obtained by modulating directly the energy exchange processes in the receptor coupling element, which is qetier,aliy und to resonance to enhance the near field power transfer between the transmitter and transponding device. In the Plessey transponder, the method by which phase modulation of the reply signal is achieved places a limit, dependent on the retransmitting antenna quality factor, on the information rate achievable in the reply signal, as the bandwidth of the retransmitting coil tuned circuit establishes the rate at which signals of one phase will be attenuated and signals of another phase will he built up, when a change in the reply code takes place. The limitation is a significant one as the electromagnetic coupling between the transponder and the receiver also depends on the transponder antennaQ factor with the result that a narrow tuned circuit bandwidth is normally desired. In our invention the method of modulation for the generation of a coded reply signal is such as to effect the phase change required without any dissipation of energy and the previously mentioned constraints do not exist. Further, in contrast to the Plessey patent referred to above, only a single coupling element is necessary for reception of the energizing power and retransmission of the reply signal. The Hutton and Kramer patent described the classic two port transponder of the Plessey variety, and a source of dc potential for operating the transponder is provided by rectifying the interrogating signal. In relation to the Vinding system, important characteristics of our system are that the information in the reply code is transmitted in frequency ranges which differ from the interrogation frequency by factors of many times the bandwidth of the antenna tuned circuits, and at rates which can exceed by many times that bandwidth. For the Vinding system to be practical, information must be transmitted at closely related sidebands of the interrogation frequency as both the interrogation and transponder antennas in that system must be tuned to a narrow bandwith in order to enhance the coupling between them, and the information bandwidth is therefore limited to a corresponding extent.The wide separation in our system between the interrogation and reply frequencies allows highly effective filtering of the interrogation energy from the receiver system, to the antenna of which the interrogation energy is normally strongly coupled as a consequence of the fact that both coupling elements scan the same region of space. In the Vinding system a single antenna element is used for both transmission and reception, and thereby making the task of uncoupling the interrogation and reply signals more difficult. The difference has important practical consequences as in the Vinding system any disturbance to the interrogation antenna field by other objects moving in its vicinity will produce detuning and loading effects which will tend to obscure the modulation cffects introduced by the transponder. In our system the effect of such moving objects is vastly different in that while some moderate amplitude modulation of the reply signal would occur, the information content would not be seriously degraded.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows diagrammatically the basic elements of the invention, namely the transponder and the associated interrogator consisting of a transmitter and receiver, showing the mutual coupling between the transponder coupling element and the transmitter and receiver coupling elements, FIGS. 2 and 3 show respectively how the transponder coupling element can be connected across the resonating capacitor either directly or in crossed coupling, FIG. 4 is a table showing the switching cycle which can be used to obtain a nuniber of different sub harmonics from a given transmitted signal, the att erlls shown repeating cyclically, FIG. 5, 6 and 7 show the wave forms achieved by some selected switching, FIG. 8 shows how switching may be effected by a series connected field effect transistor, showing also the wave form achieved when interrupting alternate cycles, FIG. 9 shows similarly how a parallel connected field effect transistor can be used to produce a different wave form, FIG. 10 shows how a single coupling element in the transponder can be replaced by a switched array of coupling elements, FlGS. 11, 12, 13 and 14 show respectively one particular array, a method of switching the array, one possible cyclic energy exchange process wave form, atd a table showing Ue, sequence of connections required to produce the indicated wave form, FIGS. 15 and 16 show respectively a circuit diagram for generating an amplitude or phase modulated reply code using a single coil and capacitor, and several wave forms are shown. FIGS 17 and 18 show respectively a circuit for an alternative method of control, and a waveform produced thereby, FIG.19 is a circuit diagram of an alternative form of device for generating the control signal, FIG.20 is a block diagram of a code generator, and FIG 21 is a typical wave form or the code therefrom. The essential characteristics of the invention can be better appreciated by reference to FIG.1 in which the energy at a frequency ft, for example 100 kHz, from transmitter 8 is fed to the transmitter coupling element 3 and is received at the transponder coupling element 1 by means of mutual coupling M13, between the transponder element 1 and transmitter element 3. Coupling M12 also exists between the transponder element 1 and the coupling element 2 of the receiver 7, the transmitter 8 and the receiver 7 forming the interrogator.The energy received by the transponder coupling element 1 is exchanged in an oscillatory manner with complementary energy storage element 6 through the switching network 5 operating under control circuit 4 which derives timing signals and possibly control power from the transponder element 1 via path P2 and operates the switching network via path PI. The switching network 5 provides for either direct connection as shown in FIG.2 or crossed connection as shown in FIG.3 between the transponder coupling element 1 and resonating capacitor 6. The switchiny network also provides under suitable coiitrol signals for eitltcr short circuit or open circuit of those elements. The control circuit provides signals which implement in a cyclic fashion a suitable set of interconnections for the energy exchange process desired. The switching is however constrained to interact with the energy exchange process in such a way as to provide for preservation as far as possible of stored energy within the purely reactive elements. This objective is achieved by arranging the switching times so that capacitors are only short circuited at the time at which they have reached zero voltage, and inductors are only open circuited at the time at which they have reached zero current. The switching elements in the switching array could be any form Of electrical or mechanical switch suitable for frequency range used witch has the characteristics that its interposition between the reactive energy storage elements does not greatly increase tie losses involved in the resonant process. FIGS. 5, 6 and 7 show in conjunction with FIG. 4 the gencratioll of some particular examples of an unlimited number of sub harmonic frequencies of a given transmi t tc d signal. In FIG. 4 direct interconnection of the capacitor and the inductor is signified by a plus s, crossed interconnection is signified by a minus sign, while a zero indicates that both elements are open circuit In FIGS. 5, 6 and 7 WF1 shows the voltage at the transmitter frequence ft across the transmitter coupling element coil, WF2, WF4 and WF6 show the current in the transponder inductor, and WF3, WF5 andWF7 show the voltage across a receiver coupling element coil tuned to the appropriate sub harmonic frequency ft n. FIGS. 5, 6 and 7 show respectively the wave forms when switching patterns appropriate to the generation 1 1 1 of the sub harmonic frequencies 2fat, 3fit, Xft, are implemented, for example these corresponding to 50 kHz, 33.3 kHz and 25 kHz respectively when the transmitter frequency is 100 kHz. These switching patterns are defined, together with others which generate further sub harmonic frequencies, in FIG.4. The columns in FIG. 4 show the switching arrangements which are required for successive time intervals of one half period of the transmitter frequency ft.As FIG. 4 indicates, the patterns are to be repeated cyclically. FIG. 8 illustrates one way in which the switching operation required for the generation of subharmonic lft may be realized by means of a simple series switch which is operated to interrupt alternate cycles of the oscillation at the zeros of the inductor current. In this example, the switching is provided by means of a field effect transistor FET .The wave forms of inductor voltage and current are shown as WF8 and WF9 respectively. An alternative method of the generation of the same sub harmonic frequency is illustrated in FIG. 9 in which a single parallel switch is operated to suspend alternate cycles of the oscillation at the zeros of the capacitor voltage. The wave forms shown in the example of FIGS. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are unmodulated but a wide variety of modulation methods described later in the specification may be used. A more general example of the principles of the invention is shown in FIG. 10 in which energy is exchanged In a cyclic fashion between an array of PI coupling elements 1 1 to l M and an array of complementary storage elements 6 1 to 6 N via a switching array 5. The switching array provides at any one time for the interconnection of any number of capacitors and any number of coupling elements in series or parallel with any polarity, as well as providing for open or short circuit connection of any of the individual elements, and is operated in such a way that continuity of stored energy across the instants of switching is preserved. The set of coupling element inductors 1 1 to l M which between them provide near field coupling of the interrogation energy into and the reply signal out from the transponder, are coupled by mutual inductance in varying including zero degrees to the transmitter and receiver systems.The sizes of inductors and capacitors ad the switching process involved are so adjusted as to provide tiiat at least one of the inductors containscurrents with an harmonic component at the transmitter frequency, so that the induced voltage in that inductor dt the transmitter frequency can produce a net power transfer to the transponder, while at least one coupling element inductor possesses harmonic components at substantially different frequencies so that information may be relayed to a receiver which may be tuned to reject signals at the transmitted frequency. The reply signal from the transponder is designed to carry an information bearing code. Such a code can easily be imposed upon the reply signal by varying the pattern of energy exchange between the reactive energy storage elements so that there is generated either at one time a coded multiplicity of reply signal frequencies, or over a period of time a coded succession of amplitudes, frequencies or phases of the reply signal, while at the same time the characteristics of low loss energy exchange between the reactive elements and extraction of sufficient energy from the transmitted field to cover the loss in the resonance process are maintained. FIG.11 illustrates one particular realization of the switching array and energy storage elements section of FIG.10. Here two coupling element inductors 1 1 and 1 2 and three capacitors 6 1, 6 2, and 6 3 are shown. Each of the six switching blocks within FIG.11 is of the form shown in FIG.12 with connections la to 4a to respective capacitors and coupling elements. This switching block is realized in this instance from field effect transistors. Appropriate rectangular voltages at control gates w,x,y and z can provide any of the desired open circuit, short circuit, direct cross connection or inverted cross connection conditions desired. FIG.13 shows one possible cyclic energy exchange process from an unlimited number which may be realised with the connections of FIG.11. In this example the basic sub harmonic frequency 1 ft is produced WF14, together with other harmonics Wt of the basic sub harmonic.The sequence of connections required to produce the indicated wave forms WF12, WF13 and WF14 WF12 indicating the wave form at the inductor 1 1 and WF13 indicating the wave form at the inductor 1 2 is defined in FIG.14, in which there is shown for successive time periods equal in length to one half period of the transmitter frequency the connections which are established between each of the capacitors and coupling elementinductors. In the table a dash appearing for any time period signifies that the indicated coupling element inductor is left open circuit, while any capacitor not mentioned in any time period is also left open circuit. FIG. 15 shows one way in which control functions which result in the generation of an amplitude or phase modulated reply code at a sub harmonic frequency 1 ft from a transponder employing a single coupling 7 t element coil 1 and energy storage capacitor 6 can be implemented. In this particular example dc power for energising the control circuit and in particular a code generator thereof is provided by rectification and storage of part only of the tuned circuit voltage by rectifier 23 and capacitor 22. Provision of the dc power in this way is not however necessary, and even when it is so provided, the essential nature of the invention, namely that the reply signal power is not derived in this way, is preserved. The circuit is best understood by reference toFIG.16 which shows wave forms produced by the principal sub units of the system. The basic idea of the circuit is to maintain coherence between a voltage controlled oscillator VCO 11, which is turnable over a suitable range in the vicinity of transmitted frequency, and appropriate points of the wave form of the oscillation which is induced in the transponder resonant circuit by the transmitter and which is periodically suspended, without energy loss, by the control circuit. In this particular circuit the oscillation is first converted to digital form in the zero crossing detector 12 which produces an output when the oscillation is greater than or equal to zero, to produce the wave form WE15 . The divider 13 and the edge detector 14 circuits produce respectively wave forms wF16 and WFl7, the latter consisting of a series of negative pulses marking positive going transition of the transponder tuned circuit wave form. In the example to which the wave forms apply, these pulses occur at intervals of twice the interrogation frequency period, as the oscillation has been suspended for alternate cycles. If the tuned circuit switch TR1 were continuously left open, as does occur when some forms of modulation of the reply code are used, the tuned circuit oscillation would proceed uninterrupted and the pulses in the WFi7 wave form would occur with a period equal to that of the transmItter signal.Whichever of these two situations applies, pulses of a separation equal to twice the transmitter signal period are produced by gating the wave form WF17 by the phasing wave form in WF18 in the sampling circuit to produce a reference pulse train WFl9 which occurs at half the frequency of the oscillation. The phasing wave form WF18 is derived in a straightforward manner from the voltage controlled oscillator output WF21, via a divider 15 and a phasing circuit. The function of the reference pulse trainWFl9 is to control the frequency of the transponder VCO 11. This is accomplished by standard phaselocked loop techniques using a commercially available integrated circuit 10 containing a phase comparator, an LPF and the VCO 11 to which the inputs are WFl9 and wave form WF20 fed back from the VCO 11 output via the divider 15. The circuit as outlined above is arranged to suspend oscillation of the transponder resonant circuit during even numbered cycles of the transmitter wave form.This will occur if the output from the code generator block 20,functions of which would be described elsewhere, in a binary 1 . If the output of the code generator block is changed to a binary O , the circuit functions are altered in an obvious way with the result that oscillations of the transponder tuned circuit are permitted during even numbered cycles of the transmitter wave form and suspended during odd numbered cycles. The result of this is that the output signal of the transponder tuned circuit may be PSX modulated in harmony with the output from the code generator. Normally the time allocated to each bit of the serial reply code would correspond to several cycles of the sub harmonic frequency of for example 8 cycles. An elementary modification of the above circuit to produce binary on off modulation in place of PSK modulation would be to replace the gate 21 within the block marked PSK modulator by a NOR gate to which the code input is inverted. Other obvious modifications to the modulation methods and parameters may be employc .d. An alternative method of performing the control functions which generate the first subharmonic frequency Ift with a single inductor and capacitor is shown in FIG. 17. In this circuit, by way of illustration, the three elements inductor 1, capacitor 6 and switch TR1 are placed in series.The control circuit monitors both the inductor voltage WF24 and voltage WF25 across the switch TR1.Both these voltages are shown in the accompanying wave forms of FIG. 18. The function of the control circuit is to determine those points, marked inFIG. 18 by 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35, at which oscillations should be suspended by the opening of the switch TR1, and those points in FIG. 18 marked 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41, at which the switch TR1 is to be closed to permit oscillation in phase with transmitted signal to be resumed. For the determination of these points the sampled voltages WF24 and WF25 are first filtered respectively by low pass filters 52 and 51 free of high frequency transients which occur upon the opening or closing of tulle switch TIZl as a result of stray inductances or capacitances in the circuit. The resulting wave forms are then digitized in comparators 54 and 53 respectively which produce an output when their input is less than or equal to zero and produce the waveforms WF27 and WF26 shown. Selected positive transitions of the two wave forms are used alternately to switch a cycle select flip flop 55.This flip flop 55 controls the operation of the tuned circuit switch TR1 at alternate cycles of the transmitter frequency in a manner which is also affected by the output of the code generator 20 in this particular example the output of the cycle select flip flop 55 and code generator 20 are conFined to produce amplitude modulation rather than phase modulation of the reply signal at the sub harmonic frequency 2f. The output of the cycle select flip flop is also used to active a monostable timing pulse generator 56 which has the function of inhibiting the clock input to cycle select flip flop 55, for a sufficient time after the switch TR1 has been opened or closed, to allow the previously mentioned switching transients to have been effectively attenuated.The code generator 20 has an output to a modulator 38 which also receives a signal from the flip flop 55 to control the switch TRi. In this and other examples of control circuits the design of the code generator is a matter of ordinary skill. A single example of the code generator design will therefore be given later. In FIG.19 there is illustrated yet another method of providing the control signals which modulate the energy exchange process between the inductor 1 and energy storage capacity 6. Again the objective is to produce the sub harmonic frequency 2 t by suspending oscillation in the transponder tuned circuit on alternate periods of the transmitter wave form. The tuned circuit is again a series one and the suspension of the oscillation is obtained by opening the switch TR1 at a positive transition of the inductor current wave form. The information for detecting the transition is obtained by inserting in the series resonant circuit a current sampling resistor 61, whose value is small enough to not significantly lower the quality factor of the resonant circuit. The voltage drop across the resistor is monitored in a comparator 62 and used to trigger transitions of a cycle select flip flop 63, the output nf which when set opens the switch, provided the output of the code generator 20 is a binary one. The operations just described will suspend the oscillations at the required time. A second function which the circuit must provide is the resumption of the oscillations one transmitter frequency period later. In this circuit, this function is achieved by providing a second inductor 64 and switch TR2. The switch TR2 is closed as the main switch TR1 is opened with the result that capacitor 6 and the auxiliary inductor 64 execute an auxiliary timing oscillation which bears,a fixed time relationsh,ip to that rormea Dy trie inductor i and tfle capacitor b. of the tuned circuit v7 An obvious and useful case results when the value of inductor 64 equals the value of inductor 1 in which case the auxiliary oscillation is of the same time period as that occurring within the main tuned circuit. A positive transition of the current in the inductor 64 in which current flows also through 61 will ayain trigger the cycle select flip flop 63 and cause a suspension of the auxiliary oscillation and a resumption of the main one. The operations just described are those which occur when the output of the code generator is a binary one. When the output of the code generator is a binary zero, the circuit operation is changed in an obvious way with the result that the time intervals in which the main and auxiliary oscillations are interchanged, and the phase of the reply signal is reversed. So far as the receiver is concerned the generation of the subharmonic reply signal frequency occurs as a result of the auxiliary timing inductor 64 having a coupling to the receiver coupling element coil different from that of the inductor 1.An obvious and simple example results when the auxiliary inductor is uncoupled from both transmitter and receiver coupling element fields. One form of code generator which may be employed in conjunction with this invention is illustrated in FIG. 20. This unit consists of a read only memory ROM and address selection logic.The input to the code generator at Pll is a pulse train of ally frequency which is divided down to provide the appropriate bit rate. In the example illustrated eight bits of the code are read at a time and are converted in the multiplexer to serial output at the desired rate. The effect of a code on the reply signal is illustrated in FIG. 21. In this example the code wave form WF28 appearing at path P12, PSK modulates the reply signal carrier, which in this case is half the interrogation frequency. The phase change occurs at the instants of time 42, 43 and 44. The effect of the phase modulation on the current in the transponder inductor is shown in wave form WF29.The wave form WF30 shows the voltage across a receiver antenna element tuned to the reply signal carrier frequency with sufficient bandwidth to pass the phase modulated PSK reply signal and at the same time reject the continuous wave interrogation signal.
