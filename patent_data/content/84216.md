# Image guide.

## Abstract
The invention relates to improvements in an image guide using optical silica glass fibres. The improved image guide 10 has a light shielding and light absorbing thin layer 6 formed on the periphery of an optical fibre bundle consisting of a multiplicity of optical fibres 1 to prevent incidence of external light from the peripheral surface of the bundle and to absorb and remove any scattered light as it is transmitted to parts other than the core of each optical fibre, thereby providing improved picture quality.
