# Process for substituting and dequaternizing pyridyl ethyl quaternary salts of pyridine and bipyridine bases.

## Abstract
A process for substituting and dequaternizing pyridylethyl quaternary salts of pyridine and bipyridine bases comprising the step of heating or reacting the pyridylethyl quaternary salt with a caustic material such as sodium hydroxide. Also included is a process for preparing a second pyridine base or a bipyridine base in which a first pyridine base is initially selected and its 2 2 pyridyl ethyl or 2 4 pyridyl ethyl quaternary salt or its acid salt prepared. An electrophilic, nucleophilic or coupling reaction can then be performed on the quaternary salt to change the substituent or to form the bipyridyl coupling and the resultant salt dequaternized with a caustic material, such as sodium hydroxide, to produce a second pyridine or a bipyridine base.
