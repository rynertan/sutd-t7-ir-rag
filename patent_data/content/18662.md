# Multi position armrest.

## Abstract
The armrest 12, 14 incorporates a parallelogram linkage 24, 30 which permits the armrest 12, 14 to be raised or lowered through a series of parallel positions and locked in any one against downward movement. A ratchet 40 and pawl arrangement permits the armrest 12, 14 to be tilted while in various fixed positions of the linkage 24,30 , or, simultaneously as the linkage is moved. Movements of the arm or linkage in a lowering direction are controlled by a pair of manually operated buttons which operate separate, spaced apart pawls which engage different teeth on a single ratchet member 40 . The buttons are not required for upward movement. The armrest 12, 14 can function as such or can be lowered to be flush with the seat so as to extend the seat width. It can also be tilted downwardly to a hip supporting position or upwardly to a vertical storage position. Various cam and stop arrangements restrict movements of the armrest outside a preferred range.
