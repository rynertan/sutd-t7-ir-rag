# MECHANICAL SPLICING APPARATUS FOR BELTS, AND METHOD

## Abstract
The present invention provides a splice for high ten sion belts 19, 16 in which the ends 10, 12 of the belt are curved at about right angles to the belt. Plates 22, 24 are placed on the outside of the two belt ends, spacer bushings 40, 41 are placed between the plates and through aper tures in the belt ends, bolts 28, 29 are placed through holes in the two plates and through the spacer bushings, and the bolts are tightened, causing the plates to press against the spacer bushings. The bolts are pretensioned by tightening them to a predetermined tension which is higher than the tension experienced during operation.
