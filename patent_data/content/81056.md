# A data processing network having a distributed data file access control.

## Abstract
Dynamic replication of data under distributed system control to control the utilization of resources in a multi processing, distributed data base system avoiding a central node maintained control, or synchronization by immediately conforming all copies of an updated data file, is achieved by a distributed access control of peer elements by which, requests for access to data of a specified currency are permitted and conformation of updated data is selectively deferred by use of a control procedure implemented at each node 10, 12, 14 and utilizing a status and control table in SAC 60, 62, 64 at each node which describes that node s view of the status for shared data items at other nodes. Access, including copying and deletion permission, is granted, when a search of the local table discloses no conflict. If conflict is disclosed, messages are exchanged with all involved nodes until the local table discloses no conflict.
