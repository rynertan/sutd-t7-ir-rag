# Cell specific glycopeptide ligands.

## Abstract
Cell specific ligands comprising conjugates of sacchar ides and amino acids or peptides are synthesized from amino acids such as ornithine, lysine, peptides such as dilysine, diornithine or oligolysine and selected saccharides having reactive functional groups protected by appropriate blocking groups. Such glycopeptides include e.g. ₂ ², ⁶ bis 3 α mannopyranosylthio propionyl lysyl N⁶ 3 α mannopyranosylthio propionyl lysine . Those compounds are useful as tissue specific substances, which when coupled with bioactive materials through metaboliz able or hydrolyzable linkages, deliver such bioactive mate rials to the selected site. In this manner, antiinflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone are linked through a metabo lizable or hydrolyzable linkage and on administration to an animal suffering from inflammatory disease carries the drug to the site of inflammation for intracellular release.
