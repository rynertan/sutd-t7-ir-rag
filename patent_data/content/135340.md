# Method and apparatus for producing stereoscopic images.

## Abstract
Stereoscopic apparatus is described in which the spec tral components of each perspective of the image are supplied in sequence and in such a way that whilst the left eye is receiving one spectral component of one of the perspectives, the right eye receives the other spectral component of the other perspective, and in alternating periods the left eye receives the other spectral component of its perspective whilst the right eye receives the first spectral component of its perspective. Various means for producing the image and for viewing the two perspectives are illus trated.
