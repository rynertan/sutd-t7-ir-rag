# Monoclonal antibodies to interferon alpha 2 and hybridomas producing such antibodies.

## Abstract
This invention relates to monoclonal antibodies to in terferon alpha₂ and to hybridomas producing such antibod ies. These antibodies are preferably of the immunoglobulin subclass IgG1 and preferably do not bind to alpha₁ of alpha₇ interferon. They can be used in assaying, purifying or isolating pro teins such as interferon alpha₂, to which they are specific.
