# HYDRAULIC STEERING SYNCHRONIZATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A hydraulic steering synchronization system for use with straddle type mobile cranes wherein upon actuation of the system and movement of the steering wheels through a normal side to side cycle, the movement of the steering wheels provides a signal to effect a balancing flow of hy draulic fluid to the hydraulic cylinders which control the movement of the steering wheels to effect resynchronization of their position, and to correct any misalignment therebe tween.
