A treatment unit is disclosed for the introduction of a reactive additive into molten metal and particularly for the introduction of a nodularizing agent into cast iron. The treatment unit is adapted to be located in, on, or above a pouring ladle 14 and comprises a pouring bush 1 opening directly or indirectly into a covered additive container 2 which is provided in its base and or peripheral walls with a plurality of holes to allow the passage therethrough of mol ten metal.
