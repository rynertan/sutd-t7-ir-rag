# Method and apparatus for reducing operating noise in axial piston pumps and motors.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus are disclosed for reducing operating noise in axial piston pumps and motors. An elongated passage 88, 98 connects the outlet plenum 86 of the apparatus directly with each cylinder 30 during its discharge stroke, the passage being positioned between the point 68 at which the discharge stroke begins and the leading edge 78 of the discharge port 74 of the apparatus and the length and cross section of the passage being sufficient to permit gradual attenuation of any pressure differential between each cylinder and the outlet plenum before the cylinder opens to the discharge port leading to the outlet plenum.
