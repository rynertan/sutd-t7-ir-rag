# Boolean filtering method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for discriminating noise from linear target tracks in three dimensional thresholded mosaic sensor data are disclosed. Two specific types of filters employing Boolean filter architecture are developed, con tinuity and monotonicity, and their performance evaluated in terms of false track exceedance rate at the output of the filter. An implementation structure using CCD technology is also presented.
