# Apparatus for the flexibilization of synthetic resinous foam.

## Abstract
Rigid plastic foam is flexibilized in an apparatus utiliz ing four sets of foam gripping belts. A first 54 and second 74 set of opposed belts traveling at a given speed forward the foam into the apparatus to a third 56 and fourth 75 set of opposed belts traveling at a slower speed than the first 54 and second 74 set of belts. The first 54 and third 56 and the second 74 and fourth 75 sets of belts are inter digitated in a region of foam crush.
