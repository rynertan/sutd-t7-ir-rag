## Abstract
Metallic load carrying elements 3, 23 are helically spun around a central member 1, 21 comprising a supporting member or members 9, 24 constituting a structure 4, 24 which defines at least one passage 6, 26 wholly accommo dating at least one electrical or optical transmission element 7, 27 . The transmission element is thereby protected against stresses applied to the load carrying elements. The central structure is radially and longitudinally self supporting. The central member 1, 21 is formed by causing the supporting member or members 9, 24 and the transmis sion element or elements 7, 27 to converge to a point from which the central member 1, 21 is withdrawn continuously. The load carrying elements 3, 23 are subsequently applied to the central member 1, 21 . Cales of practically unlimited length can be produced.
