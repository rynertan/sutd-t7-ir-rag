# Encoding and decoding data in a data storage system.

## Abstract
For encoding data prior to storage on a disk or other magnetic media, input data patterns are compared with data patterns stored in a programmable logic array 16 . Uniquely encoded patterns of flux transitions to be written to the mag netic media based upon the results of the comparison are out put. Shift registers 12 and 18 serialise parallel input data from a host computer and deserialize data upon reading from the media to the host computer. In a writing operation, the con tents of the input shift register 12 are presented in increasing multiples of two bits by a latch 14 to the logic array 16 until a pattern is recognised. Thereupon a corresponding encoded pattern with logic ones separated by at least one zero is output to the output shift register 18 and thence serially to a magne tic disk. In a reading operation, an encoded flux transition pat tern is read serially from the disk to the input shift register 12 from which it is presented in increasing multiples of three bits by the latch 14 to the logical array 16 until a pattern is re cognised. Thereupon the corresponding data pattern is output by the array 16 to the output register 18 and thence in 8 bit bytes by a latch 32 to the host computer.
