# Improved product recovery in pressure swing adsorption process and system.

## Abstract
A portion of the void space gas released from an adsor bent bed during the cocurrent depressurization thereof, and to be used to provide purge gas, is passed directly to a bed to be purged. The remaining portion of such gas is passed simultaneously to an external surge drum. The gas in the external drum is thereafter passed to a bed to be purged.
