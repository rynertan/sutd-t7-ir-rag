# Exhaustively prepolymerized supported alpha olefin polymerization catalyst.

## Abstract
An exhaustively prepolymerized supported olefin polymerization catalyst component comprises solid, hydro carbon insoluble, magnesium containing, titanium containing catalyst particles which have been contacted with an olefin monomer and an organo aluminum co catalyst under exhaustive prepolymerization conditions at an Al Ti atomic ratio such that the weight of prepolymer formed is less than 10 times the weight of such catalyst particles and the resulting prepolymerized catalyst particles essentially are inactive to further polymerization.
