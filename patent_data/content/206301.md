# Room temperature vulcanizable polydiorganosiloxane compositions.

## Abstract
Novel rooms temperature vulcanizable polydiorganosi loxane compositions comprising an α,ω dihydroxypolydior ganosiloxane and a poly alkoxysilylalkyl amine. These compositions are neutral cure, exhibit excellent shelf life stability, possess a practically controllable cure rate and upon curing produce elastomers which have good adhesion to building materials and which possess good weather ability.
