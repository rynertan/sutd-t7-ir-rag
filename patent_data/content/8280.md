# An apparatus for the pre breaking of heterogeneous materials, as city solid wastes.

## Abstract
An apparatus for breaking heterogeneous material, in particular city solid wastes which are conveyed on a endless belt conveyor 27 which passes underneath the apparatus comprising a plurality of substantially parallel and ordinately closely juxtaposed to each other blades 15 and counterblades 8 , this breaking system being supported by a guiding articulated quadrilateral rod system 13, 14, 18 adapted in unison and in sequence to open and raise to close counterblades 8 under the control of hydraulic cylinders 10 , while a second auxiliary system 4, 25, 37, 40 provides to raise the first system at the end of the work stroke and to lower it again just before the beginning of its working stroke.
