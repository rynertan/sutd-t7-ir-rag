# Backporch gating pulse generator subject to disabling during vertical sync interval.

## Abstract
In a TV receiver, a line rate gating pulse generator in cludes a source 50 of line rate timing pulses of back porch timing relative to the horizontal blanking intervals of received TV signals. Normally, the time constant of a capa citor charging circuit 62, 63 , enabled by the leading edge of each timing pulse, is determinative of a fixed, finite width for output gating pulses which are generated in response to the timing pulses TP . However, during the appearance of a field rate pulse DP e.g., vertical drive pulse , the charging circuit is altered such as to establish a zero width for the output gating pulses, resulting in a desired field rate blank ing of the line rate gating pulse output.
