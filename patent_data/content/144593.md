# Control system for a voltage type inverter.

## Abstract
In a control system for a voltage type inverter which comprises a bridge connection of electric valves each comprising a reverse parallel connection of a semiconductor switching element and a diode, and converts a DC power to an AC power by means of PWM control, a voltage detection means is provided to detect an output voltage of the inverter. A voltage correction circuits corrects the pulse width of the pulse width modulation signal in accordance with the comparison of the detected voltage and the PWM signal. A drive circuit, which provides a dead time during which the switching elements of the electric valves connected in series with each other are concurrently non conductive, uses the corrected PWM signal for driving the switching element.
