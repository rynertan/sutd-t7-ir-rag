## Description
This invention relates to human pancreatic elastase. Elastase is a serine protease, capable of hydrolyzing the fibrous insoluble protein known as elastin. Elastin is a scleroprotein forming connective tissues, tendons, aortic integuments and cervical bundles of higher animals. Elastin is only slightly degraded by pepsin and trypsin. In the course of their study on arterioscleorosis, Balo Elastase has been confirmed to exist in the pancreas of most animals, including humans, monkeys, cats, rabbits, etc. The level is about 3.1 mg g pancreas in human beings, about 2.2 mg g in bovine animals and about 10.2 mg g in rats. A correlation is recognized between elastase activity and the age of a human being a marked lowering in elastase activity is observed in the pancreas and plasma of males over 40 and females over 60 years Loeven, W A and Baldwin, Maureen M Gerontologia, In the case of patients with arteriosclerosis, the elastase activity in the pancreas was found to be markedly lower than that of healthy people, and in some cases it had completely disappeared Balo , J, and Banga, I Nature, Studies on the pharmacological action of elastase have been carried out in rats and rabbits, and have revealed the following effects In clinical studies conducted on the basis of the studies mentioned above, the following effects have become apparent after oral administration of elastase Elastase extracted and purified from porcine pancreas was used for the above studies. However, with administration of porcine elastase to human beings, there is the risk of antibody formation due to the foreign protein, and the danger of anaphylaxis with repeated administration Japanese Patent Application Laid open 11180 1984 . Accordingly, human elastase is preferable for human use. However it has been extremely difficult to procure human elastase in sufficient quantities from traditional sources. At present, two kinds of human pancreatic elastase are known, elastase I and elastase II. They have not been fully characterized. For example, for pancreatic elastase II, a partial sequence of 16 amino acid residues representing 12 amino acid residues in the activation peptide and 4 amino acid residues at the N terminal end of the elastase have been sequenced Largman, C It is an object of this invention to make human pancreatic elastase more readily available, with the possibility of obtaining the elastase in substantially pure form. It is a further object of this invention to eliminate the continuing dependency on human pancreas for adequate supplies of human pancreatic elastase. It is a yet further object to produce new elastase compounds and elastase like compounds. This invention embraces the use of genetic engineering for the production of human pancreatic elastase. Recombinant DNA technology is employed, in order to provide a base sequence coding for a human pancreatic elastase or a functionally similar compound. Correspondingly, human pancreatic elastase and functionally similar compounds now become readily available for the first time. Indeed, novel elastases have been discovered and are part of this invention. Thus, through the use of genetic engineering, it is now possible in accordance with the present invention to provide a DNA which codes for a compound capable of functioning as a human pancreatic elastase. Novel human pancreatic elastases are provided, as well as derivative compounds which function as human pancreatic elastases. Such compounds, which include compounds arising from silent mutations, fusion proteins and other compounds functionally effective as a human pancreatic elastase, are included. Thus, any substantially similar protein effective as a human pancreatic elastase, including compounds corresponding to human pancreatic elastases with one or more deleted, replaced or altered amino acids, and compounds corresponding to human pancreatic elastases with one or more extra amino acids, are also included. More especially, precursor compounds such as proelastases and preproelastases, especially when expressed by a recombinant DNA sequence, as well as elastases obtained by activation of such precursor compounds, are part of this invention. Further examples of precursor compounds within this invention include fusion proteins comprising an elastase optionally in the form of a proelastase or preproelastase and an amino acid sequence derived from another protein. In particular, such fusion proteins can be obtained when the DNA coding for an elastase is inserted into an expression gene downstream of a promotor. In particular, the present invention provides new human pancreatic elastases which include forms of elastase which herein are termed elastase IIA, IIB, IIIA and IIIB. For convenience, the preferred aspects of the present invention are considered in four aspects, corresponding to the human pancreatic elastases IIA, IIB, IIIA and IIIB. In considering the following amino acid sequences for these elastases, it is to be borne in mind that the present invention embraces any substantially similar protein effective as a human pancreatic elastase, including compounds with one or more deleted, replaced, altered or extra amino acids.

The DNA of this invention, including the base sequences represented by the formulae II , IV , VI and VIII with optional extensions, can be produced for example in accordance with the steps a to d From the DNA, the corresponding protein can then be prepared, for example by the steps of Considering the process in some more detail, several method are available which may be used in the extraction of mRNA from the human pancreas, including for instance the guanidine thiocyanate hot phenol method, the guanidine thiocyanate caesium chloride method, or the guanidine thiocyanate guanidine hydrochloride method. The last mentioned method is preferred since it is superior to the other two methods in the following respects the operation is simpler recovery of extraction is high extraction from a relatively large number of organs is possible no contaminating DNA is entrained and degradation of mRNA is low. Most of the mRNA existing in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is known to have a poly A sequence at the 3 end. Utilizing this specific feature, mRNA can be purified by adsorbing it onto a column of an oligo dT cellulose, and then eluting it. Using the mRNA obtained as a template, complementary double stranded DNA can be synthesized with the use of a reverse transcriptase. Several methods can be employed for synthesising the double stranded DNA, including for example the S1 nuclease method Efstratiadis, A The double stranded cDNA is thus inserted into a suitable vector. The vector typically takes the form of a plasmid, especially a plasmid with a unique restriction endonuclease site, more especially a restriction site within a phenotypic sequence. Various techniques can be employed for inserting the cDNA into the vector, including homopolymer tailing and the direct ligation of sticky ends produced following digestion of both the cDNA and the vector with a restriction endonuclease. The recombinant plasmids containing the cDNA can then be introduced into a suitable host, suitably a strain of It is then necessary to select from amongst the transformants the clones which contain DNA coding for a human pancreatic elastase. This selection can be achieved by several methods, including the direct sequencing method and the colony hybridization method. In the present invention the colony hybridization method is preferred. For example, cDNA of porcine elastase I Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No 207583 1985 corresponding to EP157604A published 9 October 1985 and further corresponding to USSN 716,189 filed March 26, 1985 labelled with ³²P or cDNA of rat elastase II labelled with ³²P can be used as the probe for human elastase. The base sequence contained in the selected clone may, if desired, be determined. Determination can be effected, for example, by dideoxynucleotide termination sequencing using phage M13 Messing, J The elastase cDNA may then be isolated from the plasmid DNA of the selected clone, inserted into an appropriate expression vector and introduced into an appropriate host in order to allow expression therein. The expression vector originally created may be cut with appropriate restriction endonucleases to construct further vectors containing the elastase cDNA. Bacteria such as The DNA of the present invention may be introduced into the host by transformation using any of several methods, including the Hanahan method Hanahan, D J Mol Biol, The host thus obtained the transformed host can be cultured in a suitable medium to produce and accumulate the elastase or a substance having the same effect, followed by recovery thereof. Typical media for culturing the transformed host include those comprising glucose, casamino acids, and other known components, for example, M9 medium Miller, J Experiments in Molecular Genetics, 431 to 433, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, New York 1972 The transformed host is generally cultured at 15 to 43 C for 3 to 24 hours, with aeration or stirring, if necessary. However, when mammalian cells are used as the host, it is usually necessary to carry out the culture for 3 to 10 days. After culturing, the transformed host can be harvested in a conventional manner, for example by centrifugation or other known techniques. When Isolation of elastase from the supernatant or the precipitate may be practised according to the conventional methods known in the art for the purification of proteins. The typical elastases produced by the present invention include proelastases and other elastase derivatives. After any appropriate activation, the elastases generally exhibit comparable biological activity to those purified from human pancreatic fluid. They can be used for the same purposes and in the same ways as the extracted elastases. Thus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise an elastase of this invention, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The present invention is further illustrated by the following non limiting Examples. In the Examples, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which Human pancreas autopsy sample weighing 5.5 g was homogenised and denatured in a homogeniser a Polytron homogeniser from Kinematica GmbH, Germany, Polytron being a Trade Mark in an adequate amount of guanidine thiocyanate solution 4M guanidine thiocyanate 1 detergent, Sarcosyl from Sigma Chemical Co, USA 20mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA 25mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 100mM 2 mercaptoethanol and 0.1 antifoaming agent, Antifoam A from Sigma Chemical Co USA , followed by centrifugation, to obtain a supernatant. One volume of supernatant was added to 0.025 volumes of 1M acetic acid and 0.75 volumes of ethanol, and the mixture cooled to 20 C for several hours, followed by centrifugation, to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate was suspended in a guanidine hydrochloride solution 7.5M guanidine hydrochloride 25mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 and 5mM dithiothreitol, DTT . To 1 volume of the suspension was added 0.025 volumes of 1M acetic acid and 0.5 volumes of ethanol, and the resultant mix cooled to 20 C for several hours, followed by centrifugation. The resultant precipitate was suspended again in more of the guanidine hydrochloride solution, mixed as before with acetic acid and ethanol, cooled to 20 C and centrifuged, followed by collection of the precipitate. Next, the precipitate was washed several times with ethanol to remove guanidine hydrochloride, and then dissolved in distilled water, followed by precipitation of the RNA with ethanol. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation to give 53.9 mg of RNA. The RNA thus obtained was adsorbed onto an oligo dT cellulose column in a high concentation salt solution 0.5M NaCl 20mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 1mM EDTA and 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS , and the mRNA containing poly A was eluted with an elution buffer 10mM Tris HCl, pH7.5 1mM EDTA and 0.05 SDS to give 255 µg of mRNA.

After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, the aqueous layer was collected. 20 µl of 4M ammonium acetate and 80 µl of ethanol were added to the aqueous layer and the mixture cooled to 70 C for 15 minutes.The precipitate was then collected by centrifugation and washed with 75 aqueous ethanol and dried under reduced pressure. The resultant precipitate was dissolved in 15 µl of terminal transferase reaction mixture 140mM potassium cacodylate, of formula C₂H₆AsKO₂ 30 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8 1mM cobalt chloride 0.5mM DTT 0.2 µg of poly A and 100mM of dCTP . After incubating the solution at 37 C for 3 minutes, 18 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase were added and allowed to react for 5 minutes. The above reaction was stopped by addition of 1 µl of 0.25M EDTA and 0.5 µl of 10 SDS. Deproteinization was then carried out with phenol chloroform. After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, the aqueous layer was collected. 15 µl of 4M ammonium acetate and 60 µl of ethanol were added to the aqueous layer and mixed well. After cooling the mixture to 70 C for 15 minutes, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 µl of a buffer for restriction endonuclease 50mM NaC1 10mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 10mM MgCl₂ and 1mM DTT . 2.5 units of the restriction enzyme HindIII were added to the solution and the solution digested at 37 C for about 1 hour. After deproteinization with phenol chloroform, precipitation was carried out with ethanol. After cooling to 70 C for 15 minutes, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 10 µl of TE 10mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 1mM EDTA . 1 µl of the above sample solution was then added to a reaction solution 10mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 1mM EDTA and 100mM NaCl , followed by addition of 10 µg of linker purchased from PL Pharmacia bearing oligo dG. The resulting mixture was heated at 65 C for 5 minutes and maintained at 42 C for 30 minutes. After cooling the reaction solution in ice water, 10 µl of 10 fold ligase buffer solution 10mM ATP 660mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 66mM MgCl₂ and 100mM DTT , 78 µl of distilled water and 8 units of T4 DNA ligase were added to the solution and the reaction mixture maintained at 12 C overnight. Then, to the thus prepared mixture, 10 µl of 1M KCl, 1 unit of ribonuclease H, 33 units of DNA polymerase I, 4 units of T4 DNA ligase, 0.5 µl of nucleotide solution 20mM dATP, 20 mM dGTP, 20mM dCTP and 20mM dTTP and 0.1 µl of 50 µg µl bovine serum albumin BSA were added and the mixture maintained at 12 C for 1 hour and then at 25 C for 1 hour. After diluting the reaction solution 5 fold, The DNA from 4,700 clones of the human pancreatic cDNA bank was fixed onto nitrocellulose filter according to the method of Grunstein, M and Hogness, D S Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA, In order to select a clone including a plasmid containing human pancreatic elastase IIA cDNA, a rat pancreatic elastase II cDNA fragment was employed as a probe. The rat pancreatic elastase II cDNA was obtained by the following method. Firstly a cDNA bank was prepared using mRNA extracted from rat pancreas. Then, an oligodeoxynucleotide 5 d GGCATAGTCCACAACCA 3 comprising 17 bases was synthesized complementary to a part of the known base sequence of rat pancreatic elastase II mRNA MacDonald, R 8 clones reactive with the probe were identified by autoradiography. A plasmid from one of the strains was named pH2E2 . The restriction endonuclease cleavage map of the DNA inserted in pH2E2 was determined and is shown in Figure 1. The base sequence was determined and is of the formula 5 TT TTA CAG AAC TCC CAC GGA CAC ACC Beginning at the underlined ATG triplet, the encoded amino acid sequence is of the formula N Met Ile Arg Thr Leu Leu Leu Ser Thr Leu Val Ala Gly Ala Leu Ser Cys Gly Asp Pro Thr Tyr Pro Pro Tyr Val Thr Arg Val Val Gly Gly Glu Glu Ala Arg Pro Asn Ser Trp Pro Trp Gln Val Ser Leu Gln Tyr Ser Ser Asn Gly Lys Trp Tyr His Thr Cys Gly Gly Ser Leu Ile Ala Asn Ser Trp Val Leu Thr Ala Ala His Cys Ile Ser Ser Ser Arg Thr Tyr Arg Val Gly Leu Gly Arg His Asn Leu Tyr Val Ala Glu Ser Gly Ser Leu Ala Val Ser Val Ser Lys Ile Val Val His Lys Asp Trp Asn Ser Asn Gln Ile Ser Lys Gly Asn Asp Ile Ala Leu Leu Lys Leu Ala Asn Pro Val Ser Leu Thr Asp Lys Ile Gln Leu Ala Cys Leu Pro Pro Ala Gly Thr Ile Leu Pro Asn Asn Tyr Pro Cys Tyr Val Thr Gly Trp Gly Arg Leu Gln Thr Asn Gly Ala Val Pro Asp Val Leu Gln Gln Gly Arg Leu Leu Val Val Asp Tyr Ala Thr Cys Ser Ser Ser Ala Trp Trp Gly Ser Ser Val Lys Thr Ser Met Ile Cys Ala Gly Gly Asp Gly Val Ile Ser Ser Cys Asn Gly Asp Ser Gly Gly Pro Leu Asn Cys Gln Ala Ser Asp Gly Arg Trp Gln Val His Gly Ile Val Ser Phe Gly Ser Arg Leu Gly Cys Asn Tyr Tyr His Lys Pro Ser Val Phe Thr Arg Val Ser Asn Tyr Ile Asp Trp Ile Asn Ser Val Ile Als Asn Asn C It can be seen that plasmid pH2E2 has a region coding for a signal peptide comprising 16 amino acids and a region coding for the mature elastase protein termed elastase IIA. The elastase IIA comprises 253 amino acids. Plasmid pH2E2 also contains 5 and 3 non translated regions. There is as much as 84 homology between the amino acid sequence coded by the DNA insertion of plasmid pH2E2, and that of rat pancreatic elastase II reported by MacDonald, R J Since pH2E2 contains an entire DNA coding for human pancreatic elastase IIA, it is possible to produce large amounts of the elastase IIA by transferring the cDNA to an appropriate expression vector and using, for example, In order to produce human elastase IIA using mammalian cells as host, the cDNA was ligated to an expression vector according to the procedure indicated in figure 2. The known pSV2 plasmid cortaining the SV40 promoter, enhancer, poly A signal and introns of the small T antigen SV40 gene was used for construction of the expression vector. pSV2 β globin is a plasmid based on the pSV2 vector with inserted β globin cDNA. Plasmid pH2E2 is the plasmid with inserted human elastase IIA cDNA. The reactions for with S1 nuclease, etc. were carried out according to the methods described in Molecular Cloning Maniatis, T From analysis of the restriction endonuclease digestion pattern, an expression plasmid pSV2 E2A was selected in which vector and cDNA were ligated in the correct orientation for transcription. The constructed expression plasmid pSV2 E2A was transfected into COS 1 mammalian cells by the calcium phosphate method described in the literature Graham and van der Eb Virology Thus, 1 10⁶ of COS 1 cells were seeded on Petri dishes 10 cm in diameter , and cultured overnight on Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 10 fetal calf serum. Plasmid pSV2 E2A 300 µg was suspended in sterile distilled water 12.55 ml , then 2.5 M CaCl₂ 0.75 ml was added and the suspension mixed thoroughly. A pipette was used to bubble air through the system in order to maintain agitation, and 1.5 ml of 10 HeBS solution HEPES, 210 mM NaCl, 1.37 M KCl 4.7 mM Na₂HPO₄, 10.6 mM glucose, 55.5 mM pH 7.05 was dropped into the resulting solution to precipitate the DNA and calcium phosphate. The precipitate was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to mature the precipitate, and 1 ml of the solution for each Petri dish was added to the COS 1 cells cultured in fresh medium containing 10 fetal calf serum. After cultivation of these cells for 12 hours at 37 C in the presence of 5 CO₂, the culture medium was discarded in favour of a fresh, Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing no fetal calf serum. The cells were cultured for a further 48 hours at 37 C in the presence of 5 CO₂. The transfected COS 1 cells obtained by this procedure were tested to detect the presence of human elastase IIA mRNA, while the supernatant of the culture medium was tested for elastase activity. In order to confirm the existence of human elastase IIA mRNA transcribed from the expression plasmid in the transfected COS 1 cells, mRNA was extracted from the COS 1 cells and assayed by Northern blot hybridization according to the following procedure. After cultivation of the COS 1 cells for 48 hours, 1 ml of guanidine thiocyanate solution 4M guanidine thiocyanate 1 Sarcosyl 20 mM EDTA 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 100 mM 2 mercaptoethanol 0.1 Antifoam A was added to each Petri dish in order to lyse the cells. High molecular DNA molecules were degraded to low molecular ones by passing the solution several times through a 21 guage injection needle. The resultant solution was layered on a solution containing 5.7 M cesium chloride and 0.1 EDTA, and the solution centrifuged at 20 C, 30,000 rpm for 17 hours using a Hitachi RPS 40 swing rotor. The resultant RNA precipitate was washed with a small amount of ethanol and dissolved in distilled water 300 µl . According to the method of Aviv and Leder Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 69, 1408 1972 , the extracted total RNA was purified on an oligo dT cellulose column to give several µg of purified mRNA. Half of the purified mRNA was used for Northern blot hydridization by the Thomas method Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA The results thus show that using SV40 promoter in COS 1 cells, the plasmid pSV2 E2A can synthesize large quantities of human elastase IIA mRNA. Since the human elastase IIA cDNA in pSV2 E2A has a signal peptide region, secretion of expressed elastase into the medium as a proelastase was expected. Elastase activity in the medium after 48 hours cultivation was accordingly determined. Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 was added to the supernatant of the culture medium 1 ml to a final concentration of 0.2 M, 10 mg ml trypsin 50 µl was added, and an activation treatment of the proelastase was carried out for 15 minutes at 25 C. Next, 50 µl of soybean trypsin inhibitor solution 10 mg ml and a synthetic substrate, glutaryl Ala Ala Pro Leu p nitroanilide were added, and the enzyme reaction was carried out by incubation at 25 C. After completion of the reaction, liberated p nitroanilide was determined by measuring absorbance at 410 nm. The elastase activity in the culture medium of COS 1 cells transfected with pSV2 E2A was distinctly detected, and the production of active human elastase IIA in COS 1 cells was found. The activation treatment with trypsin or other activator was indispensable. The production of human elastase IIA in COS 1 cells transfected with plasmid pSV2 E2A was transient. However, if plasmid pSV2 E2A is linked with a suitable selection marker for example, the The construction method for the expression vector is illustrated in figure 3. Plasmid pH2E2 containing human elastase IIA cDNA was digested with restriction endonuclease HindIII to a linear DNA, and then partially digested with restriction enzyme PvuII. A DNA fragment of about 1.3 Kb containing the elastase IIA cDNA was isolated. This fragment was partially digested with restriction endonuclease AvaII to give a fragment containing cDNA coding for the amino acid sequence beginning from the third amino acid counted from the N terminal end of the elastase IIA activation peptide. The specific oligonucleotide sequence shown in Figure 4 was synthesised. This sequence codes for part of the signal peptide of On the other hand, plasmid pTUB228 Ohmura, K The three DNA fragments were ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and incorporated into protoplasts of The expression plasmid obtained in this manner was designated plasmid pBSEX E2A. After completion of the culture, the culture medium was cooled to 4 C and centrifuged at 3000 G for 5 minutes, and the cells discarded. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 55 saturation, and the solution was stirred at 4 C for 12 hours. Insoluble material formed in this treatment was precipitated by centrifugation at 8000 G for 20 minutes, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was dissolved in 20 ml of 0.2 M Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 . This solution was dialyzed against 1 1 of 0.2 M Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 for 16 hours, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 8000 G for 20 minutes. The dialyzed solution was taken as a crude elastase IIA sample solution, and the activity was determined by the following procedure. Proelastase was activated by trypsin treatment of the sample solution, and allowed to react at 25 C with a synthetic substrate, glutaryl Ala Ala Pro Leu p nitroanilide. Liberated p nitroanilide was determined by measuring absorbance at 410 nm. Since elastase activity was distinctly detected in the sample solution from the 207 25 strain transformed with pBSEX E2A, the production of active human elastase IIA in Various different promoters may be used, including for instance the tryptophan trp promoter, lactose lac promoter, tryptophan lactose tac promoter, lipoprotein lpp promoter, lambda λ P As shown in figure 5, plasmid pH2E2 containing human elastase IIA cDNA was digested with restriction endonuclease HindIII to form a linear DNA, and then partially digested with restriction enzyme PvuII to isolate a DNA fragment of about 1.3 Kb containing elastase IIA cDNA. This fragment was partially digested with restriction endonuclease DdeI to give a fragment containing cDNA coding for an amino acid sequence down stream from the activation peptide of elastase IIA. By treatment of this DNA fragment DNA polymerase Klenow fragment and four kinds of deoxyribonucleoside 5 triphosphates dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP , both ends were converted to blunt ends. The resultant DNA fragment was inserted into the SmaI site of plasmid pUC8. The base sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence for around the 5 end of the elastase cDNA in pH2EX 2 are as follows. β galactosidase elastase Thr Met Ile Thr Asn Ser Leu Ser Cys Gly Asp ... ATG ACC ATG ATT ACG AAT TCC CTC AGT TGT GGG GAC ... Therefore, the human elastase IIA expressed by pH2EX 2 is shown to be a fused protein in which two amino acids Leu, Ser derived from the signal peptide and six amino acids derived from β galactosidase combine at the N terminal. Several As a result, a large quantity of elastase production was found in strain YA21. The production yield of elastase fusion protein was 20 of the total protein produced by the YA21 strain. Though a considerable production of elastase fusion protein in χ984 strain was observed, the production yield was less than half that in the YA21 strain. The production yields in two other Since the elastase fusion protein forms inclusion bodies in cells, purification was coparatively easy. Thus, from 1 l of a culture medium of YA21 strain transformed with plasmid pH2EX 2, 6.5 g of cells forming inclusion bodies could be obtained. The obtained cells 6.5 g were lysed in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 containing 0.2 mg ml lysozyme and 1 mg ml deoxycholic acid. Intact cells were removed by low speed centrifugation 1,500 G, 10 minutes and inclusion bodies were recovered as a precipitate by high speed centrifugation 11,000 x G, 20 minutes . Since the precipitate still contained much cell debris, the precipitate was suspended in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer solution containing 5 mg ml octylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol surfactant Triton X 100, Trade Mark and washed by high speed centrifugation 11,000 G, 20 minutes . A washed pellet of inclusion bodies was suspended in a small amount of Tris HCl buffer solution and stored at 4 C. The purified inclusion body 300 mg containing about 50 elastase IIA fusion protein could be obtained by this procedure. The inclusion body produced by YA21 strain transformed with pH2EX 2 was shown to contain the elastase fusion protein by immuno blotting. Though most of the elastase produced by Proelastase was activated by trypsin treatment of the sample solution. Next, p nitroanilide liberated by the reaction with a synthetic substrate, glutaryl Ala Ala Pro Leu p nitroanilide, was determined by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm. The reaction was carried out by incubation at 25 C in 0.2 M Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 containing the synthetic substrate. As a result, elastase activity was distinctly detected in the sample solution of strain χ984 transformed with plasmid pH2EX 2, and therefore the production of active human elastase IIA was demonstrated. In the case of yeast as a host and as with a Human pancreas autopsy sample weighing 5.5 g was homogenized and denatured in a homogeniser a Polytron homogeniser from Kinematica GmbH, Germany, Polytron being a Trade Mark in an adequate amount of guanidine thiocyanate solution 4M guanidine thiocyanate 1 detergent, Sarcosyl from Sigma Chemical Co, USA 20mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA 25mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 100mM 2 mercaptoethanol and 0.1 antifoaming agent, Antifoam A from Sigma Chemical Co USA , followed by centrifugation, to obtain a supernatant. One volume of supernatant was added to 0.025 volumes of 1M acetic acid and 0.75 volumes of ethanol, and the mixture cooled to 20 C for several hours, followed by centrifugation, to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate was suspended in a guanidine hydrochloride solution 7.5M guanidine hydrochloride 25mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 and 5mM dithiothreitol, DTT . To 1 volume of the suspension was added 0.025 volumes of lM acetic acid and 0.5 volumes of ethanol, and the resultant mix cooled to 20 C for several hours, followed by centrifugation. The resultant precipitate was suspended again in more of the guanidine hydrochloride solution, mixed as before with acetic acid and ethanol, cooled to 20 C and centrifuged, followed by collection of the precipitate. Next, the precipitate was washed several times with ethanol to remove guanidine hydrochloride, and then dissolved in distilled water, followed by precipitation of the RNA with ethanol. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation to give 53.9 mg of RNA. The RNA thus obtained was adsorbed onto an oligo dT cellulose column in a high concentration salt solution 0.5M NaCl 20mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 1mM EDTA and 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS , and the mRNA containing poly A was eluted with an elution buffer 10mM Tris HCl, pH7.5 lmM EDTA and 0.05 SDS to give 255 µg of mRNA. The preparation of a cDNA bank was carried out according to the Okayama Berg method. 5 µg of the mRNA and 24 units of a reverse transcriptase were incubated at 42 C for 60 minutes in 20 µl of a reaction mixture 50mM of Tris HCl, pH 8.3 8mM of MgCl₂ 30mM of KCl 0.3 mM of DTT 2mM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP 10 µCi of α ³²P dCTP and 1.4 µg of vector primer DNA, purchased from PL Pharmacia . The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 µl of 0.25M EDTA and 1 µl of 10 SDS. Deproteinization was carried out with 20 µl of phenol chloroform. After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, the aqueous layer was collected. 20 µl of 4M ammonium acetate and 80 µl of ethanol were added to the aqueous layer and the mixture cooled to 70 C for 15 minutes. The precipitate was then collected by centrifugation and washed with 75 aqueous ethanol and dried under reduced pressure. The resultant precipitate was dissolved in 15 µl of terminal transferase reaction mixture 140mM potassium cacodylate, of formula C₂H₆AsKO₂ 30 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8 1mM cobalt chloride 0.5mM DTT 0.2 µg of poly A and 100mM of dCTP . After incubating the solution at 37 C for 3 minutes, 18 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase were added and allowed to react for 5 minutes. The above reaction was stopped by addition of 1 µl of 0.25M EDTA and 0.5 µl of 10 SDS. Deproteinization was then carried out with phenol chloroform. After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, the aqueous layer was collected. 15 µl of 4M ammonium acetate and 60 µl of ethanol were added to the aqueous layer and mixed well. After cooling the mixture to 70 C for 15 minutes, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 µl of a buffer for restriction endonuclease 50mM NaCl 10mMTris HCl, pH 7.5 10mM MgCl₂ and 1mM DTT . 2.5 units of the restriction enzyme HindIII were added to the solution and the solution digested at 37 C for about 1 hour. After deproteinization with phenol chloroform, precipitation was carried out with ethanol. After cooling to 70 C for 15 minutes, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 10 µl of TE 10mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 1mM EDTA . 1 µl of the above sample solution was then added to a reaction solution 10mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 lmM EDTA and 100mM NaCl , followed by addition of 10 ng of linker purchased from PL Pharmacia bearing oligo dG. The resulting mixture was heated at 65 C for 5 minutes and incubated at 42 C for 30 minutes. After cooling the reaction solution in ice water, 10 µl of 10 fold ligase buffer solution 10mM ATP 660mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 66mM MgCl₂ and 100mM DTT , 78 µl of distilled water and 8 units of T4 DNA ligase were added to the solution and the reaction mixture incubated at 12 C overnight. Then, to the thus prepared mixture, 10 µl of 1M KCl, 1 unit of ribonuclease H, 33 units of DNA polymerase I, 4 units of T4 DNA ligase, 0.5 µl of nucleotide solution 20mM dATP, 20 mM dGTP, 20mM dCTP and 20mM dTTP and 0.1 µl of 5o µg µl bovine serum albumin BSA were added and the mixture incubated at 12 C for 1 hour and then at 25 C for 1 hour. After diluting the reaction solution 5 fold, The DNA from 4,700 clones of the human pancreatic cDNA bank was fixed onto nitrocellulose filter according to the method of Grunstein, M and Hogness, D S Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA, In order to select a clone including a plasmid containing human pancreatic elastase IIB cDNA, a rat pancreatic elastase II cDNA fragment was employed as a probe. The rat pancreatic elastase II cDNA was obtained by the following method. Firstly a cDNA bank was prepared using mRNA extracted from rat pancreas. Then, an oligodeoxynucleotide 5 d GGCATAGTCCACAACCA 3 comprising 17 bases was synthesized complementary to a part of the known base sequence of rat pancreatic elastase II mRNA MacDonald, R 8 clones reactive with the probe were identified by autoradiography. A plasmid from one of the strains was named pH2E8 . The restriction endonuclease cleavage map of the DNA inserted in pH2E8 was determined and is shown in Figure 6. The base sequence was determined and is of the formula 5 C TTA CAG AAC TCC CAC GGA CAC ACC Beginning at the underlined ATG triplet, the encoded amino acid sequence is of the formula N Met Ile Arg Thr Leu Leu Leu Ser Thr Leu Val Ala Gly Ala Leu Ser Cys Gly Val Ser Thr Tyr Ala Pro Asp Met Ser Arg Met Leu Gly Gly Glu Glu Ala Arg Pro Asn Ser Trp Pro Trp Gln Val Ser Leu Gln Tyr Ser Ser Asn Gly Gln Trp Tyr His Thr Cys Gly Gly Ser Leu Ile Ala Asn Ser Trp Val Leu Thr Ala Ala His Cys Ile Ser Ser Ser Arg Ile Tyr Arg Val Met Leu Gly Gln His Asn Leu Tyr Val Ala Glu Ser Gly Ser Leu Ala Val Ser Val Ser Lys Ile Val Val His Lys Asp Trp Asn Ser Asn Gln Val Ser Lys Gly Asn Asp Ile Ala Leu Leu Lys Leu Ala Asn Pro Val Ser Leu Thr Asp Lys Ile Gln Leu Ala Cys Leu Pro Pro Ala Gly Thr Ile Leu Pro Asn Asn Tyr Pro Cys Tyr Val Thr Gly Trp Gly Arg Leu Gln Thr Asn Gly Ala Leu Pro Asp Asp Leu Lys Gln Gly Arg Leu Leu Val Val Asp Tyr Ala Thr Cys Ser Ser Ser Gly Trp Trp Gly Ser Thr Val Lys Thr Asn Met Ile Cys Ala Gly Gly Asp Gly Val Ile Cys Thr Cys Asn Gly Asp Ser Gly Gly Pro Leu Asn Cys Gln Ala Ser Asp Gly Arg Trp Glu Val His Gly Ile Gly Ser Leu Thr Ser Val Leu Gly Cys Asn Tyr Tyr Tyr Lys Pro Ser Ile Phe Thr Arg Val Ser Asn Tyr Asn Asp Trp Ile Asn Ser Val Ile Ala Asn Asn C It can be seen that plasmid pH2E8 has a region coding for a signal peptide comprising 16 amino acids and a region coding for the mature elastase protein termed elastase IIB. The elastase IIB comprises 253 amino acids. Plasmid pH2E8 also contains 5 and 3 non translated regions. There is as much as 77 homology between the amino acid sequence coded by the DNA insertion of plasmid pH2E8, and that of rat pancreatic elastase II reported by MacDonald, R J Since pH2E8 contains an entire DNA coding for human pancreatic elastase IIB, it is possible to produce large amounts of the elastase IIB by transferring the cDNA to an appropriate expression vector and using, for example, In order to produce human elastase IIB using mammalian cells as host, the cDNA was ligated to an expresion vector according to the procedure indicated in figure 7. The known pSV2 plasmid containing the SV40 promoter, enhancer, poly A signal and introns of the Small T antigen gene was used for construction of the expression vector. pSV2 β globin is a plasmid based on the pSV2 vector with inserted β globin cDNA. Plasmid pH2E8 is the plasmid with inserted human elastase IIB cDNA. The reactions with S1 nuclease, etc, were carried out according to the methods described in Molecular Cloning Maniatis, T From analysis of the restriction endonuclease digestion pattern, an expression plasmid pSV2 E2B was selected in which vector and cDNA were ligated in the correct orientation for transcription. The constructed expression plasmid pSV2 E2B was transfected into COS 1 mammalian cells by the calcium phosphate method described in the literature Graham and Van der Eb Virology Thus, 1 10⁶ of COS 1 cells were sprayed on Petri dishes 10 cm in diameter , and cultured overnight on Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 10 fetal calf serum. Plasmid pSV2 E2B 300 µg was suspended in sterile distilled water 12.55 ml , then 2.5 M CaCl₂ 0.75 ml was added and the suspension mixed thoroughly. A pipette was used to bubble air through the system in order to maintain agitation, and 1.5 ml of 10 HeBS solution HEPES, 210 mM NaCl, 1.37 M KCl 4.7 mM Na₂HPO₄, 10.6 mM glucose, 55.5 mM pH 7.05 was dropped into the resulting solution to precipitate the DNA and calcium phosphate. The precipitate was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to mature the precipitate, and 1 ml of the solution for each Petri dish was added to the COS 1 cells cultured in fresh medium containing 10 fetal calf serum. After cultivation of these cells for 12 hours at 37 C in the presence of 5 CO₂, the culture medium was discarded in favour of a fresh, Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing no fetal calf serum. The cells were cultured for a further 48 hours at 37 C in the presence of 5 CO₂. The transfected COS 1 cells obtained by this procedure were tested to detect the presence of human elastase IIB mRNA, while the supernatent of the culture medium was tested for elastase activity. In order to confirm the existence of human elastase IIB mRNA transcribed from the expression plasmid in the transfected COS 1 cells, mRNA was extracted from the COS 1 cells and assayed by the Northern blot hybridization according to the following procedure. After cultivation of the COS 1 cells for 48 hours, 1 ml of guanidine thiocyanate solution 4M guanidine thiocyanate 1 Sarcosyl 20 mM EDTA 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 100 mM 2 mercaptoethanol 0.1 Antifoam A was added to each Petri dish in order to lyse the cells. High molecular DNA molecules were degraded to low molecular ones by passing the solution several times through a 21 guage injection needle. The resultant solution was layered on a solution containing 5.7 M cesium chloride and 0.1 EDTA, and the layered solution centrifuged at 20 C, 30,000 rpm for 17 hours using a Hitachi RPS 40 swing rotor. The resultant RNA precipitate was washed with a small amount of ethanol and dissolved in distilled water 300 µl . According to the method of Aviv and Leder Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 69, 1408 1972 , the extracted total RNA was purified on an oligo dT cellulose column to give several µg of purified mRNA. Half of the purified mRNA was used for Northern blot hydridization by the Thomas method Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA The results thus show that using SV40 promoter in COS 1 cells, the plasmid pSV2 E2B can synthesize large quantities of human elastase IIB mRNA. Since the human elastase IIB cDNA in pSV2 E2B has a signal peptide region, secretion of expressed elastase into the medium as a proelastase was expected. Elastase activity in the medium after 48 hours cultivation was accordingly determined. Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 was added to the supernatant of the culture medium 1 ml to a final concentration of 0.2 M, 10 mg ml trypsin 50 µl was added, and an activation treatment of the proelastase was carried out for 15 minutes at 25 C. Next, 50 µl of soybean trypsin inhibitor solution 10 mg ml and a synthetic substrate, glutaryl Ala Ala Pro Leu p nitroanilide were added, and the enzyme reaction was carried out by incubation at 25 C. After completion of the reaction, liberated p nitroanilide was determined by measuring absorbance at 410 nm. The elastase activity in the culture medium of COS 1 cells transfected with pSV2 E2B was distinctly detected, and the production of active human elastase IIB in COS 1 cells was found. The activation treatment with trypsin or other activator was indispensable. The production of human elastase IIB in COS 1 cells transfected with plasmid pSV2 E2B was transient. However, if plasmid pSV2 E2B is linked with a suitable selection marker for example, the The construction method for the expression vector is illustrated in figure 8. Plasmid pH2E8 containing human elastase IIB cDNA was digested with restriction endonuclease HindIII to a linear DNA, and then partially digested with restriction enzyme PvuII. A DNA fragment of about 1.3 Kb containing the elastase IIB cDNA was isolated. This fragment was partially digested with restriction endonuclease HhaI to give a fragment containing cDNA coding for the amino acid sequence beginning from the eighth amino acid counted from the N terminal end of the elastase IIB activation peptide. The specific oligonucleotide sequence shown in Figure 8 was synthesised. This sequence codes for part of the signal peptide of On the other hand, plasmid pTUB228 Ohmura, K The three DNA fragments were ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and incorporated into protoplasts of The expression plasmid obtained in this manner was designated plasmid pBSEX E2B. After completion of the culture, the culture medium was cooled to 4 C and centrifuged at 3000 G for 5 minutes, and the cells discarded. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 55 saturation, and the solution was stirred at 4 C for 12 hours. Insoluble material formed in this treatment was precipitated by centrifugation at 8000 G for 20 minutes, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was dissolved in 20 ml of 0.2 M Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 . This solution was dialyzed against 1 1 of 0.2 M Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 for 16 hours, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 8000 G for 20 minutes. The dialyzed inner solution was taken as a crude elastase IIB sample solution, and the activity was determined by the following procedure. Proelastase was activated by trypsin treatment of the sample solution, and allowed to react at 25 C with a synthetic substrate, glutaryl Ala Ala Pro Leu p nitroanilide. Liberated p nitroanilide was determined by measuring absorbance at 410 nm. Since elastase activity was distinctly detected in the sample solution from the 207 25 strain transformed with pBSEX E2B, the production of active human elastase IIB in Various different promoters may be used, including for instance the tryptophan trp promoter, lactose lac promoter, tryptophan lactose tac promoter, lipoprotein lpp promoter, lambda λ P As shown in figure 10, plasmid pH2E8 containing human elastase IIB cDNA was digested with restriction endonuclease HindIII to form a linear DNA, and then partially digested with restriction enzyme PvuII to isolate a DNA fragment of about 1.3 Kb containing elastase IIB cDNA. This fragment was partially digested with restriction endonuclease DdeI to give a fragment containing cDNA coding for an amino acid sequence down stream from the activation peptide of elastase IIB. By treatment of this DNA fragment with DNA polymerase Klenow fragment and four kinds of deoxyribonucleoside 5 triphosphates dATP , dCTP, dGTP, dTTP , both ends were converted to blunt ends. The resultant DNA fragment was inserted into the SmaI site of plasmid pUC8. The base sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence for around the 5 end of the elastase cDNA in pH2EX 2 are as follows. β galactosidase elastase Thr Met Ile Thr Asn Ser Leu Ser Cys Gly Asp ... ATG ACC ATG ATT ACG AAT TCC CTC AGT TGT GGG GTC ... Therefore, the human elastase IIB expressed by pH2EX 8 is shown to be a fusion protein in which two amino acids Leu, Ser derived from the signal peptide and six amino acids derived from β galactosidase combine at the N terminal. Several As a result, a large quantity of elastase production was found in strain YA21. The production yield of elastase fusion protein was 20 of the total protein produced by the YA21 strain. Though a considerable production of elastase fusion protein in χ984 strain was observed, the production yield was less than half that in the YA21 strain. The production yields in two other Since the elastase fusion protein forms inclusion bodies in cells, purification was comparatively easy. Thus, from 1 1 of a culture medium of YA21 strain transformed with plasmid pH2EX 8, 6.5 g of cells forming inclusion bodies could be obtained. The obtained cells 6.5 g were lysed in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 containing 0.2 mg ml lysozyme and 1 mg ml deoxycholic acid. Intact cells were removed by low speed centrifugation 1,500 G, 10 minutes and inclusion bodies were recovered as a precipitate by high speed centrifugation 11,000 G, 20 minutes . Since the precipitate still contained much cell debris, the precipitate was suspended in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer solution containing 5 mg ml octylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol surfactant Triton X 100, Trade Mark and washed by high speed centrifugation 11,000 G, 20 minutes . A washed pellet of inclusion bodies was suspended in a small amount of Tris HCl buffer solution and stored at 4 C. The purified inclusion body 300 mg containing about 50 elastase IIB fusion protein could be obtained by this procedure. The inclusion body produced by YA21 strain transformed with pH2EX 8 was shown to contain the elastase fusion protein by immuno blotting. Though most of the elastase produced by Proelastase was activated by trypsin treatment of the sample solution. Next, p nitroanilide liberated by the reaction with a synthetic substrate, glutaryl Ala Ala Pro Leu p nitroanilide, was determined by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm. The reaction was carried out by incubation at 25 C in 0.2 M Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 containing the synthetic substrate. As a result, elastase activity was distinctly detected in the sample solution of χ984 strain transformed with plasmid pH2EX 8, and therefore the production of active human elastase IIB in In the case of yeast as a host and as with a Human pancreas autopsy sample weighing 5.5 g was homogenised and denatured in a homogeniser a Polytron homogeniser from Kinematica GmbH, Germany, Polytron being a Trade Mark in an adequate amount of guanidine thiocyanate solution 4M guanidine thiocyanate 1 detergent, Sarcosyl from Sigma Chemical Co, USA 20mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA 25mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 100mM 2 mercaptoethanol and 0.1 antifoaming agent, Antifoam A from Sigma Chemical Co USA , followed by centrifugation, to obtain a supernatant. One volume of supernatant was added to 0.025 volumes of 1M acetic acid and 0.75 volumes of ethanol, and the mixture cooled to 20 C for several hours, followed by centrifugation, to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate was suspended in a guanidine hydrochloride solution 7.5M guanidine hydrochloride 25mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 and 5mM dithiothreitol, DTT . To 1 volume of the suspension was added 0.025 volumes of 1M acetic acid and 0.5 volumes of ethanol, and the resultant mix cooled to 20 C for several hours, followed by centrifugation. The resultant precipitate was suspended again in more of the guanidine hydrochloride solution, mixed as before with acetic acid and ethanol, cooled to 20 C and centrifuged, followed by collection of the precipitate. Next, the precipitate was washed several times with ethanol to remove guanidine hydrochloride, and then dissolved in distilled water, followed by precipitation of the RNA with ethanol. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation to give 53.9 mg of RNA. The RNA thus obtained was adsorbed onto an oligo dT cellulose column in a high concentration salt solution 0.5M NaCl 20mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 1mM EDTA and 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS , and the mRNA containing poly A was eluted with an elution buffer 10mM Tris HCl, pH7.5 1mM EDTA and 0.05 SDS to give 255 µg of mRNA. The preparation of a cDNA bank was carried out according to the Okayama Berg method. 5 µg of the mRNA and 24 units of a reverse transcriptase were incubated at 42 C for 60 minutes in 20 µl of a reaction solution 50mM of Tris HCl, pH 8.3 8mM of MgCl₂ 30mM of KCl 0.3mM of DTT 2mM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP 10 µCi of α ³²P dCTP and 1.4 µg of vector primer DNA, purchased from PL Pharmacia . The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 µl of 0.25M EDTA and 1 µl of 10 SDS. Deproteinization was carried out with 20 µl of phenol chloroform. After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, the aqueous layer was collected. 20 µl of 4M ammonium acetate and 80 µl of ethanol were added to the aqueous layer and the mixture cooled to 70 C for 15 minutes. The precipitate was then collected by centrifugation and washed with 75 aqueous ethanol and dried under reduced pressure. The resultant precipitate was dissolved in 15 µl of terminal transferase reaction solution 140mM potassium cacodylate, of formula C₂H₆AsKO₂ 30 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8 1mM cobalt chloride 0.5mM DTT 0.2 µg of poly A and 100mM of dCTP . After incubating the solution at 37 C for 3 minutes, 18 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase were added and allowed to react for 5 minutes. The above reaction was stopped by addition of 1 µl of 0.25M EDTA and 0.5 µl of 10 SDS. Deproteinization was then carried out with phenol chloroform. After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, the aqueous layer was collected. 15 µl of 4M ammonium acetate and 60 µl of ethanol were added to the aqueous layer and mixed well. After cooling the mixture to 70 C for 15 minutes, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was dissolved in a buffer for restriction endonuclease 50mM NaCl 10mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 10mM MgCl₂ and 1mM DTT . 2.5 units of the restriction enzyme HindIII were added to the solution and the solution incubated at 37 C for about 1 hour. After deproteinization with phenol chloroform, precipitation was carried out with ethanol. After cooling to 70 C for 15 minutes, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 10 µl of TE 10mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 1mM EDTA . 1 µl of the above sample solution was then added to a reaction solution 10mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 1mM EDTA and 100mM NaCl , followed by addition of 10 µg of linker purchased from PL Pharmacia bearing oligo dG. The resulting mixture was heated at 65 C for 5 minutes and maintained at 42 C for 30 minutes. After cooling the reaction solution in ice water, 10 µl of 10 fold ligase buffer solution 10mM ATP 660mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 66mM MgCl₂ and 100mM DTT , 78 µl of distilled water and 8 units of T4 DNA concentrated ligase were added to the solution and the reaction mixture maintained at 12 C overnight. Then, to the thus prepared mixture, 10 µl of 1M KCl, 1 unit of ribonuclease H, 33 units of DNA polymerase I, 4 units of T4 DNA ligase, 0.5 µl of nucleotide solution 20mM dATP, 20 mM dGTP, 20mM dCTP and 20mM dTTP and 0.1 µl of 50 µg µl bovine serum albumin BSA were added and the mixture maintained at 12 C for 1 hour and then at 25 C for 1 hour. After diluting the reaction solution 5 fold, The DNA from 4,700 clones of the human pancreatic cDNA bank was fixed onto nitrocellulose filter according to the method of Grunstein, M and Hogness, D S Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA, A porcine pancreatic elastase I cDNA fragment was excised with restriction endonuclease PstI and labelled with ³²P according to the nick translation method Rigby, P W 7 microorganism strains which hybridized with the probe were identified by autoradiography. A plasmid from one of the strains was named pCL2, and the inserted cDNA was named CL2. In CL2, there exists only one open reading frame. This sequence codes for 270 amino acids. The encoded amino acid sequence showed some homology with trypsin and chymotrypsin, to a degree of only about 30 . However, there was a higher homology, 57 , with porcine pancreatic elastase I. There also existed an amino acid sequence Gly Asp Ser Gly Gly Pro around the active center which is be commonly found in the same region in serine proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, etc. Further, there is a 45th histidine residue, 95th aspartic acid residue and 189th serine residue which can participate in the characteristic charge relay of serine proteases. Moreover, the encoded amino acid sequence adjacent the carboxyl terminal, which in elastase forms a pocket for binding with the substrate is very similar between human elastase IIIA and the porcine elastase I. There is also an encoded 211th valine residue and 223rd threonine residue, which are characteristic of a substrate binding pocket of the porcine elastase I. The base sequence was of the formula 5 ATC ATC ACA AAA CTC ATG Beginning with the underlined ATG triplet, the encoded amino acid sequence is of the formula N Met Met Leu Arg Leu Leu Ser Ser Leu Leu Leu Val Ala Val Ala Ser GLy Tyr Gly Pro Pro Ser Ser His Ser Ser Ser Arg Val Val His Gly Glu Asp Ala Val Pro Tyr Ser Trp Pro Trp Gln Val Ser Leu Gln Tyr Glu Lys Ser Gly Ser Phe Tyr His Thr Cys Gly Gly Ser Leu Ile Ala Pro Asp Trp Val Val Thr Ala Gly His Cys Ile Ser Arg Asp Leu Thr Tyr Gln Val Val Leu Gly Glu Tyr Asn Leu Ala Val Lys Glu Gly Pro Glu Gln Val Ile Pro Ile Asn Ser Glu Glu Leu Phe Val His Pro Leu Trp Asn Arg Ser Cys Val Ala Cys Gly Asn Asp Ile Ala Leu Ile Lys Leu Ser Arg Ser Ala Gln Leu Gly Asp Ala Val Gln Leu Ala Ser Leu Pro Pro Ala Gly Asp Ile Leu Pro Asn Lys Thr Pro Cys Tyr Ile Thr Gly Trp Gly Arg Leu Tyr Thr Asn Gly Pro Leu Pro Asp Lys Leu Gln Gln Ala Arg Leu Pro Val Val Asp Tyr Lys His Cys Ser Arg Trp Asn Trp Trp Gly Ser Thr Val Lys Lys Thr Met Val Cys Ala Gly Gly Tyr Ile Arg Ser Gly Cys Asn Gly Asp Ser Gly Gly Pro Leu Asn Cys Pro Thr Glu Asp Gly Gly Trp Gln Val His Gly Val Thr Ser Phe Val Ser Ala Phe Gly Cys Asn Phe Ile Trp Lys Pro Thr Val Phe Thr Arg Val Ser Ala Phe Ile Asp Trp Ile Glu Glu Thr Ile Ala Ser His C The amino acid sequence of the coded protein appears at a glance to be analogous with the amino acid composition of the human pancreatic elastase I reported by Largman The active form of the human elastase may be produced by cleaving at the carboxy group of the 28th arginine residue counted from the N terminal and retaining the longer, C terminal portion. Cleaving can be effected for example with trypsin. Since pCL2 contains an entire cDNA coding for human pancreatic elastase IIIA, it is possible to produce large amounts of the elastase IIIA by transferring the cDNA to an appropriate expression vector and using, for example, In order to produce human elastase IIIA using mammalian cells as host, the cDNA was ligated to an expresion vector according to the procedure indicated in figure II. The known pSV2 plasmid containing the SV40 promoter, enhancer, poly A signal and introns of the Small T antigen gene was used for construction of the expression vector. pSV2 β globin is a plasmid based on the pSV2 vector with inserted β globin cDNA. Plasmid pCL2 is the plasmid with inserted human elastase IIIA cDNA. The reactions with S1 nuclease, etc, were carried out according to the methods described in Molecular Cloning Maniatis, T From analysis of the restriction endonuclease cleavage pattern, an expression plasmid pSV2 CL2 was selected which incorporated the desired fragments oriented in the correct sense for the transcription of the vector and cDNA. The constructed expression plasmid pSV2 CL2 was transfected into COS 1 mammalian cells by the calcium phosphate method described in the literature Graham and Van der Eb Virology Thus, 1 10⁶ of COS 1 cells were seeded on Petri dishes 10 cm in diameter , and cultured overnight on Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 10 fetal calf serum. Plasmid pSV2 CL2 300 µg was suspended in sterile distilled water 12.55 ml , then 2.5 M CaCl₂ 0.75 ml was added and the suspension mixed thoroughly. A pipette was used to bubble air through the system in order to maintain agitation, and 1.5 ml of 10 HeBS solution HEPES, 210 mM NaCl, 1.37 M KCl 4.7 mM Na₂HPO₄, 10.6 mM glucose, 55.5 mM pH 7.05 was dropped into the resulting solution to precipitate the DNA and calcium phosphate. The precipitate was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to mature the precipitate, and 1 ml of the solution for each Petri dish was added to the COS 1 cells cultured in fresh medium containing 10 fetal calf serum. After cultivation of these cells for 12 hours at 37 C in the presence of 5 CO₂, the culture medium was discarded in favour of a fresh, Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing no fetal calf serum. The cells were cultured for a further 48 hours at 37 C in the presence of 5 CO₂. The transfected COS 1 cells obtained by this procedure were tested to detect the presence of human elastase IIIA mRNA, while the supernatent of the culture medium was tested for elastase activity. In order to confirm the existence of human elastase IIIA mRNA transcribed from the expression plasmid in the transfected COS 1 cells, mRNA was extracted from the COS 1 cells and assayed by the Northern blot hybridization according to the following procedure. After cultivation of the COS 1 cells for 48 hours, 1 ml of guanidine thiocyanate solution 4M guanidine thiocyanate 1 Sarcosyl 20 mM EDTA 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 100 mM 2 mercaptoethanol 0.1 Antifoam A was added to each Petri dish in order to dissolve the cells. High molecular DNA molecules were degraded to low molecular ones by passing the solution several times through a 21 guage injection needle. The resultant solution was layered on a solution containing 5.7 M cesium chloride and 0.1 M EDTA, and the solution centrifuged at 20 C, 30,000 rpm for 17 hours using a Hitachi RPS 40 swing rotor. The resultant RNA precipitate was washed with a small amount of ethanol and dissolved in distilled water 300 µl . 810 µg of total mRNA was isolated from about 10⁸ COS 1 cells. According to the method of Aviv and Leder Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 69, 1408 1972 , the extracted total RNA was purified on an oligo dT cellulose column to give several µg of purified mRNA. Half of the purified mRNA was used for Northern blot hydridization by the Thomas method Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA The results thus show that using SV40 promoter in COS 1 cells, the plasmid pSV2 CL2 can synthesize large quantities of human elastase IIIA mRNA, and most of the transcribed mRNA is not terminated at the poly A signal in the cDNA but instead at the poly A signal in the vector. Since the human elastase IIIA cDNA in pSV2 CL2 has a signal peptide region, secretion of expressed elastase into the medium as a proelastase was expected. Elastase activity in the medium after 48 hours cultivation was accordingly determined. The asssay was carried out using the method of Bieth 200 µl of Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.5 was added to the supernatant of the culture medium 1 ml . 10 mg ml trypsin 50 µl was added, and an activation treatment of the proelastase was carried out for 15 minutes at 25 C. Next, 50 µl of soybean trypsin inhibitor solution 10 mg ml and 10.4 µl of a synthetic substrate, succinyl Ala Ala Ala p nitroanilide 125mM dissolved in N methylpyrrolidone were added. The enzyme reaction was carried out by incubation at 37 C for one hour. After completion of the reaction, liberated p nitroanilide was determined by measuring absorbance at 410 nm. In this assay of the elastase activity using the culture broth of COS1 cells transfected with pSV2 CL2, an OD₄₁₀ value of 0.21 was found. The presence of elastase was thus recognized in the culture broth. However, the hydrolytic activity for the synthetic substrate was 5.2 , when compared with the hydrolytic activity of a culture supernatant from COS1 cells transfected with an expression plasmid pSV2 PEL1 containing the porcine elastase I cDNA linked to the pSV2 vector. It is also reported that the hydrolytic activity of the human elastase purified by Largman Thus, Suc Ala Ala Ala p nitroanilide which is a very sensitive substrate for porcine elastase, is not a sensitive substrate for assay of human elastase activity. The production of human elastase IIIA in COS 1 cells transfected with plasmid pSV2 CL2 was transient. However, if plasmid pSV2 CL2 is ligated to a suitable selection marker for example, the The construction method for the expression vector is illustrated in figure 12. Plasmid containing human elastase IIIA cDNA was digested with restriction endonucleases HindIII and BgIII, and a DNA fragment of 712 base pairs containing a part of the elastase IIIA cDNA was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. This fragment was ligated using T4 DNA with a synthetic oligopeptide shown in figure 12 comprising 93 base pairs coding for a part of the signal peptide of α amylase of On the other hand, plasmid pTUB228 Ohmura, K The three DNA fragments were ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and incorporated into protoplasts of The expression plasmid obtained in this manner was designated plasmid pHEX010. After completion of the culture, the culture medium was cooled to 4 C and centrifuged at 3000 G for 5 minutes, and the cells discarded. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 55 saturation, and the solution was stirred at 4 C for 12 hours. Insoluble material formed in this treatment was precipitated by centrifugation at 8000 G for 20 minutes, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was dissolved in 50mM of Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 . This solution was dialyzed against 500 ml of 50mM Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 for 16 hours, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 8000 G for 20 minutes. The dialyzed solution was taken as a crude elastase IIIA sample solution, and the activity was determined by the following procedure. Elastase activity in the sample solution was determined by the method described below. The synthetic substrate, N carbobenzoxy L alanine p nitrophenyl ester Sigma , was dissolved in 50 mM Tris HCl solution pH 8.0 to give a 0.1 mM solution. To 0.25 ml of this substrate solution, 0.25 ml of the elastase sample solution was added and allowed to react for 30 minutes at 37 C. Then, the absorbance at 410 nm was determined. At the same time, to the sample solution was added elastatinal or α 1 antitrypsin, an elastase inhibitor, to a final concentration of 0.1 mg ml, in order to examine the inhibition to the activity. The absorbance of the 207 25 strain into which the plasmid rightly oriented with the promoter was introduced increased by 0.32 in comparison with the control solution. The elastase activity could be inhibited by either of the above two inhibitors. In this procedure, the reaction of the restriction endonuclease and the other enzymes was carried out using the buffer solutions and the reaction conditions mentioned in the literature accompanying the commercial enzyme products. Various different promoters may be used, including for instance the tryptophan trp promoter, lactose lac promoter, tryptophan lactose tac promoter, lipoprotein lpp promoter, lambda λ P As shown in Figure 14, the human elastase IIIA cDNA, CL2, was digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI and Bg1II to give a DNA fragment of 1215 bp containing human elastase IIIA cDNA. This fragment was partially digested with restriction enzyme Fnu4HI and then treated with S1 nuclease to give a DNA fragment of 788 bp with blunt ends. Separately, plasmid pUC8 was digested with restriction endonuclease Smal and treated with phosphatase to obtain a DNA fragment containing the promoter and operator region of the lactose operon and a part of the β galactosidase coding region. The two DNA fragments were added to 30 µl of a solution containing T4 DNA ligase 66 mM of Tris HCl, pH 7.6 6.6 mM of MgCl₂ 10 mM of DTT 1mM of ATP 2.5 units of T4 DNA ligase and incubated at 6 C for 72 hours to ligate the fragmetns. The thus constructed human elastase expression plasmid was named pHEX002. Various strains of The human elastase expressed in this manner is a fused protein in which 8 amino acids originating from β galactosidase combine with the N terminal of mature human elastase, as shown below. The DNA base sequence adjacent the 5 terminal end of the elastase gene in plasmid pHEX002 and the encoded amino acid sequence are as follows β Galactosidase trypsin or clostripain Met Thr Met Ile Thr Asn Ser Arg Val Val ... ATC ACC ATG ATT ACG AAT TCC CGC GTT GTC ... The strain containing the elastase expression plasmid was inoculated on 2 TY ampicillin medium 1.6 Bactotrypsin 1 Yeast Extract 0.5 NaCl 50 µg ml amplicillin and cultured for 15 hours at 37 C. After completion of the culture, cells were harvested by centrifugation of the culture medium. 2.4 10⁸ cells were suspended in 15 µl of SDS solution 2 SDS 5 2 mercaptoethanol 10 glycerin 60 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8 . After heating this solution at 100 C for 3 minutes, product protein was analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, according to the method of Laemmli As a result, a large amount of elastase production was found in the YA21 strain. In this respect, reference is made to Figure 15, where lane 1 corresponds to molecular weight markers, and lanes 2 to 5 correspond to Since the elastase fused protein forms inclusion bodies in cells, purification was comparatively easy. Thus, from 1 1 of a culture medium of YA21 strain transformed with plasmid pHEX002, 6.5 g of cells forming inclusion bodies could be obtained. The cells 6.5 g were lysed in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 containing 0.2 mg ml lysozyme and 1 mg ml deoxycholic acid. Intact cells were removed by low speed centrifugation 1,500 G, 10 minutes and inclusion bodies were recovered as a precipitate by high speed centrifugation 11,000 G, 20 minutes . Since the precipitate still contained much cell debris, the precipitate was suspended in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer solution containing 5 mg ml octylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol surfactant Triton X 100, Trade Mark and washed by high speed centrifugation 11,000 G, 20 minutes . A washed pellet of inclusion bodies was suspended in a small amount of Tris HCl buffer solution and stored at 4 C. The purified inclusion body 370 mg containing about 58 elastase IIIA fused protein could be obtained by this procedure. The inclusion body produced by YA21 strain transformed with pH2EX 2 was shown to contain the elastase fused protein by immuno blotting. Most of the elastase produced by Elastase activity in the sample solution was determined by the following procedure. N carbobenzoxy L alanine p nitrophenyl ester Sigma , a sythetic substrate, was dissolved in 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 to give a 0.1 mM solution. To 0.25 ml of this substrate solution, 0.25 ml of the elastase sample solution was added, and, after reaction for 30 minutes at 37 C, the absorbance at 410 nm was determined. The elastase activity was detected by the increase in the absorbance of 0.41. At the same time, when elastatinal or α 1 antitrypsin an elastase inhibitor , was added to this sample solution to a final concentration of 0.1 mg ml, it was found that the inhibitor inhibited the activity. In the case of yeast as a host and as with a Human pancreas autopsy sample weighing 5.5 g was homogenised and denatured in a homogeniser a Polytron homogeniser from Kinematica GmbH, Germany, Polytron being a Trade Mark in an adequate amount of guanidine thiocyanate solution 4M guanidine thiocyanate 1 detergent, Sarcosyl from Sigma Chemical Co, USA 20 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA 25mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 100mM 2 mercaptoethanol and 0.1 antifoaming agent, Antifoam A from Sigma Chemical Co USA , followed by centrifugation, to obtain a supernatant. One volume of supernatant was added to 0.025 volumes of 1M acetic acid and 0.75 volumes of ethanol, and the mixture cooled to 20 C for several hours, followed by centrifugation, to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate was suspended in a guanidine hydrochloride solution 7.5M guanidine hydrochloride 25mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 and 5mM dithiothreitol, DTT . To 1 volume of the suspension was added 0.025 volumes of 1M acetic acid and 0.5 volumes of ethanol, and the resultant mix cooled to 20 C for several hours, followed by centrifugation. The resultant precipitate was suspended again in more of the guanidine hydrochloride solution, mixed as before with acetic acid and ethanol, cooled to 20 C and centrifuged, followed by collection of the precipitate. Next, the precipitate was washed several times with ethanol to remove guanidine hydrochloride, and then dissolved in distilled water, followed by precipitation of the RNA with ethanol. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation to give 53.9 mg of RNA. The RNA thus obtained was adsorbed onto an oligo dT cellulose column in a high concentration salt solution 0.5M NaCl 20mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 1mM EDTA and 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS , and the mRNA containing poly A was eluted with an elution buffer 10mM Tris HCl, pH7.5 1mM EDTA and 0.05 SDS to give 255 µg of mRNA. The preparation of a cDNA bank was carried out according to the Okayama Berg method. 5 µg of the mRNA and 24 units of a reverse transcriptase were incubated at 42 C for 60 minutes in 20 µl of a reaction mixture 50mM of Tris HCl, pH 8.3 8mM of MgCl₂ 30mM of KCl 0.3 mM of DTT 2mM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP 10 µCi of α ³²P dCTP and 1.4 µg of vector primer DNA, purchased from PL Pharmacia . The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 µl of 0.25M EDTA and 1 µl of 10 SDS. Deproteinization was carried out with 20 µl of phenol chloroform. After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, the aqueous layer was collected. 20 µl of 4M ammonium acetate and 80µl of ethanol were added to the aqueous layer and the mixture cooled to 70 C for 15 minutes. The precipitate was then collected by centrifugation and washed with 75 aqueous ethanol and dried under reduced pressure. The resultant precipitate was dissolved in 15 µl of terminal transferase reaction mixture 140mM potassium cacodylate, of formula C₂H₆AsKO₂ 30mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8 1mM cobalt chloride 0.5mM DTT 0.2µg of poly A and 100mM of dCTP . After incubating the solution at 37 C for 3 minutes, 18 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase were added and allowed to react for 5 minutes. The above reaction was stopped by addition of 1 µl of 0.25M EDTA and 0.5 µl of 10 SDS. Deproteinization was then carried out with phenol chloroform. After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, the aqueous layer was collected. 15 µl of 4M ammonium acetate and 60 µl of ethanol were added to the aqueous layer and mixed well. After cooling the mixture to 70 C for 15 minutes, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was dissolved in a buffer for restriction endonuclease 50mM NaCl 10mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 10mM MgCl₂ and 1mM DTT . 2.5 units of the restriction enzyme HindIII were added to the solution and the solution incubated at 37 C for about 1 hour.

After diluting the reaction solution 5 fold, The DNA from 4,700 clones of the human pancreactic cDNA bank was fixed onto nitrocellulose filter according to the method of Grunstein, M and Hogness, D S Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA, A porcine pancreatic elastase I cDNA fragment was exised with restriction endonuclease PstI and labelled with ³²P according to the nick translation method Rigby, p W 10 microorganism strains which hybridized with the probe were identified by autoradiography.

The degree of homology in base sequence between preproelastase CL2 and CL1 is as high as 95.3 . Hence the elastases are closely related proteins. In the human pancreas, the amount of mRNA corresponding to CL1 is about 10 of that for CL2. Since pCL1 contains an entire DNA coding for human pancreatic elastase IIIB, it is possible to produce large amounts of the elastase IIIB by transferring the cDNA to an appropriate expression vector and using, for example, In order to produce human elastase IIIB using mammalian cells as host, the cDNA was ligated to an expresion vector according to the procedure indicated in figure 16.

The resultant RNA precipitate was washed with a small amount of ethanol and dissolved in distilled water 300 µl . According to the method of Aviv and Leder Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 69, 1408 1972 , the extracted total RNA was purified on an oligo dT cellulose column to give several µg of purified mRNA. Half of the purified mRNA was used for Northern blot hydridization by the Thomas method Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA The results thus show that using SV40 promoter in COS 1 cells, the plasmid pSV2 CL1 can synthesize large quantities of human elastase IIIB mRNA, and most of the transcribed mRNA is not terminated at the poly A signal in the cDNA but instead at the poly A signal in the vector. Since the human elastase IIIB cDNA in pSV2 CL1 has a signal peptide region, secretion of expressed elastase into the medium as a proelastase was expected. Elastase activity in the medium after 48 hours cultivation was accordingly determined. The asssay was carried out using the method of Bieth 200 µl of Tris HC1 buffer solution pH 8.5 was added to the supernatant of the culture medium 1 ml . 10 mg ml trypsin 50 µl was added, and an activation treatment of the proelastase was carried out for 15 minutes at 25 C. Next, 50 µl of soybeam trypsin inhibitor solution 10 mg ml and 10.4 µl of a synthetic substrate, succinyl Ala Ala Ala p nitroanilide 125mM dissolved in 125mM of N methylpyrrolidone were added. The enzyme reaction was carried out by incubation at 37 C for one hour. After completion of the reaction, liberated p nitroanilide was determined by measuring absorbance at 410 nm. Elastase activity in the culture medium of COS 1 cells transfected with pSV2 CL1 was found, after activation with trypsin. The production of human elastase IIIB in COS 1 cells transfected with plasmid pSV2 CL1 was transient. However, if plasmid pSV2 CL1 is ligated to a suitable selection marker for example, the The construction method for the expression vector is illustrated in figure 17. Plasmid containing human elastase IIIB cDNA was digested with restriction endonucleases HindIII and BgIII, and a DNA fragment of 712 base pairs containing a part of the elastase IIB cDNA was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. This fragment was ligated using T4 DNA with a synthetic oligopeptide of 85 base pairs shown in figure 18 which codes for a part of the signal peptide of α amylase of On the other hand, plasmid pTUB228 Ohmura, K The three DNA fragments were ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and incorporated into protoplasts of The expression plasmid obtained in this manner was designated plasmid pHAM001. After completion of the culture, the culture medium was cooled to 4 C and centrifuged at 3000 G for 5 minutes, and the cells discarded. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 55 saturation, and the solution was stirred at 4 C for 12 hours. Insoluble material formed in this treatment was precipitated by centrifugation at 8000 G for 20 minutes, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was dissolved in 50mM Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 This solution was dialyzed against 500 ml of 50mM Tris HC1 buffer solution pH 8.0 for 16 hours, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 8000 G for 20 minutes. The dialyzed solution was taken as a crude elastase IIIB sample solution, and the activity was determined by the following procedure. Elastase activity in the sample solution was determined by the method described below. The synthetic substrate, N carbobenzoxy L alanine p nitrophenyl ester Sigma , was dissolved in 50 mM Tris HCl solution pH 8.0 to give a 0.1 mM solution. To 0.25 ml of this substrate solution, 0.25 ml of the elastase sample solution was added and allowed to react for 30 minutes at 37 C. Then, the absorbance at 410 nm was determined. At the same time, to the sample solution was added elastatinal or α 1 antitrypsin, an elastase inhibitor, to a final concentration of 0.1 mg ml, in order to examine the inhibition to the activity. The absorbance of the 207 25 strain into which the plasmid rightly oriented with the promoter was introduced increased by 0.24 in comparison with the control solution. The elastase activity could be inhibited by either of the above two inhibitors. In this procedure, the reaction of the restriction endonuclease and the other enzymes was carried out using the buffer solutions and the reaction conditions mentioned in the literature accompanying the commercial enzyme products. Various different promoters may be used, including for instance the tryptophan trp promoter, lactose lac promoter, tryptophan lactose tac promoter, lipoprotein lpp promoter, lambda λ P As shown in Figure 19, the human elastase IIIB cDNA, CL1, was digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI and Bg1II to give a DNA fragment of 1640 bp containing human elastase IIIB cDNA. This fragment was partially digested with restriction enzyme Fnu4HI and then treated with S1 nuclease to give a DNA fragment of 788 bp with blunt ends. Separately, plasmid pUC8 was digested with restriction endonuclease Smal and treated with phosphatase to obtain the DNA fragment containing the promoter and operation region of the lactose operon and a part of the β galactosidase coding region. The two DNA fragments were added to 30 µl of a solution containing T4 DNA ligase 66 mM of Tris HCl, pH 7.6 6.6 mM of MgCl₂ 10 mM of DTT 1 mM of ATP 2.5 units of T4 DNA ligase and incubated at 6 C for 72 hours to ligate the fragments. The thus constructed human elastase expression plasmid was named pHEX102. Various strains of The human elastase expressed in this manner is a fused protein in which 8 amino acids originating from β galactosidase combine with the N terminal of mature human elastase, as shown below. The DNA base sequence adjacent the 5 terminal end of the elastase gene in plasmid pHEX102 and the encoded amino acid sequence are as follows β Galactosidase trypsin or clostripain Met Thr Met Ile Thr Asn Ser Arg Val Val ... ATC ACC ATG ATT ACG AAT TCC CGC GTT GTC ... The strain containing the elastase expression plasmid was inoculated on 2 TY ampicillin medium 1.6 Bactotrypsin 1 Yeast Extract 0.5 NaCl 50 µl ml ampicillin and cultured for 15 hours at 37 C. After completion of the culture, cells were harvested by centrifugation of the culture medium. 2.4 10⁸ cells were suspended in 15 µl of SDS solution 2 SDS 5 2 mercaptoethanol 10 glycerin 60 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8 . After heating this solution at 100 C for 3 minutes, product protein was analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, according to the method of Laemmli Since the elastase fused protein forms inclusion bodies in cells, purification was comparatively easy. Thus, from 1 l of a culture medium of YA21 strain transformed with plasmid pHEX102, 6.6 g of cells forming inclusion bodies could be obtained. The cells 6.6 g were lysed in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 containing 0.2 mg ml lysozyme and 1 mg ml deoxycholic acid. Intact cells were removed by low speed centrifugation 1,500 G, 10 minutes and inclusion bodies were recovered as a precipitate by high speed centrifugation 11,000 G, 20 minutes . Since the precipitate still contained much cell debris, the precipitate was suspended in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer solution containing 5 mg ml octylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol surfactant Triton X 100, Trade Mark and washed by high speed centrifugation 11,000 G, 20 minutes . A washed pellet of inclusion bodies was suspended in a small amount of Tris HCl buffer solution and stored at 4 C. The purified inclusion body 350 mg containing nearly 50 elastase IIIB fused protein could be obtained by this procedure. The inclusion body produced by YA21 strain transformed with pHEX102 was shown to contain the elastase fused protein by immuno blotting. Most of the elastase produced by The strain χ984 transformed with plasmid pHEX102 was cultured with shaking in 1 l of 2 TY amplicillin medium at 37 C for 15 hours. After completion of the culturing, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 G for 5 minutes and suspended in 20 ml of buffer solution A 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0 1mM EDTA 50 mM NaCl . 10 mg of lyzozyme was added, and the suspension iincubatedat 5 C for 20 minutes. Deoxycholic acid to a final concentration of 1 mg ml was added to the resultant suspension which was then incubated at 20 C. Deoxyribonuclease to a final concentration of 0.1 mg ml was added, and the cells were disrupted in a Polytron homogenizer. After removal of the cell debris by centrifugation at 80,000 G, 40 minutes, the lysate was subjected to column chromatography on high molecular weight, cross linked dextran Sephadex G 75 . The fractions having elastase activity were purified by antibody affinity chromatography, and used for the following determination of elastase activity. Elastase activity in the sample solution was determined by the following procedure. N carbobenzoxy L alanine p nitrophenyl ester Sigma , a synthetic substrate, was dissolved in 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 to give a 0.1 mM solution. To 0.25 ml of this substrate solution, 0.25 ml of the elastase sample solution was added, and, after reaction for 30 minutes at 37 C, the absorbance at 410 nm was determined. The elastase activity was detected by the increase in the absorbance of 0.36. At the same time, when elastatinal or α 1 antitrypsin an elastase inhibitor , was added to this sample solution to a final concentration of 0.1 mg ml, it was found that the inhibitor inhibited the activity. In the case of yeast as a host and as with a
