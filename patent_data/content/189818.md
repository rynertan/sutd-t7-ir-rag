# Isoquinoline thromboxane synthetase inhibitors.

## Abstract
4 4 Isoquinolinylmethy amino benzoic acid deriva tives useful as selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitors are described herein. The compounds are obtained from the appropriate 4 isoquinolinecarboxylic acid derivative and an aminobenzoic acid derivative. This gives the corresponding Schiff base which is then reduced to give the desired compounds.
