## Description
STABLE PRECURSOR SOLUTION FOR THE GENERATION OF HYDROSULFITE AND USE THEREOF IN BLEACHING WOOD PULP, BRIGHTENING KAOLIN CLAY AND REDUCING VAT DYESTUFFS TO THEIR LEUCO FORM Because hydrosulfite solutions in water are unstable, for many years users have commonly prepared these solutions by dissolving a solid hydrosulfite salt in water just prior to use. Even when freshly prepared however, a few minutes after solution only 80 of the original hydrosulfite can be detected in the solution. In addition, powdered sodium hydrosulfite Na2S204 frequently ignites spontaneously upon addition of water. Contact of the solution with air leads to a rapid loss of strength due to reaction with oxygen. The rate depends upon the contact surface area. Because of the handling and solution difficulties encountered with solid hydrosulfite, an all liquid system has been desired by users. For medium to large users, who can afford the nominal capital investment, a system of generating highly stable hydrosulfite solutions using commercially available alkaline sodium borohydride water solutions for reducing sodium bisulfite NaHS03 in solution has proved extremely attractive. Other users have turned to the purchase of hydrosulfite solutions from hydrosulfite suppliers. The prepared hydrosulfite solutions must be used fresh and constantly be replenished. An unscheduled shutdown of an operation, for example, may result in the hydrosulfite solution scheduled and held for that period decomposing and therefore being useless when production is resumed. An interruption in supply can also cause problems for the user who cannot stockpile reserve solution beciluse of its instability. Storage stable solutions easily preparable by either the user or the supplier involving low capital investment, have not been previously described. U. S. Patent No. 5,167,515 describes solict mixtures of alkali metal borohydrides and alkali metal bisulfites or metabisulfites which may be dissolved in water at pH values greater than 10 to give hydrosulfite solutions having initial high strength. The metabisulfite or bisulfite to borohydride ratios are low and no mention of any solution storage stability is made. We are not aware of other material prior art. The invention provides a substantially stable aqueous solution comprising sulfite ions and borohydride ions in a mole ratio of sulfite ions to borohydride ions of at least 6 to 1 and containing sufficient hydroxyl ion to provide a pH greater than 8.0. Buch aqueous solutions having superior storage stability when compared under similar temperature, concentration, and air exposure conditions, with aqueous hydrosulfite solutions and, when added to aqueous solutions or slurries having sufficient acid capacity to produce resulting mixtures having a pH of less than 8.05 of being converted to solutions or slurries having significant concentrations of hydrosulfite ions. These solutions and slurries have been found to be useful for bleaching paper pulp, particularly thermomechanical and ground wood pulp, in leaching kaolin clays and in the vat dyeing of textile materials. Preferred aqueous solutions are those wherein the cation counter ion to the borohydride ion and the sulfite ion is an alkali metal cation, Ng , NH4 , or a mixture thereof. Special mention is made of those solutions wherein the cation is Na . The stable solutions of this invetion contain sulfite ions and borohydride ions but do not contain hydrosulfite ions. The latter are formed immediately prior to use by reducing the pH of the solution containing sulfite ions and borohydride ions to below 8. The reduction in pH leads to formation of bisulfite ions in the solution and these are then reduced by the borohydride to hydrosulfite ions. This invention also provides a process for the generation in substantially aqueous solution of hydrosulfite ions which comprises adjusting the pH of the borohydride sulfite solutions of the invention to less than 8.0. In a preferred embodiment of this process the sulfite borohydride containing solutions are added to a substantially aqueous solution or slurry containing sufficient acid for the final mixture to have a pH of less than 8.0. The invention also includes processes for bleaching mechanical wood pulp, brightening kaolin clay and reducing a vat dye to the leuco form thereof which comprise adding an effective amount of the sulfite borohydride solution of this invention to an aqueous suspension of said wood pulp, of said clay, or of said..vat dye or to an aqueous immersion of a textile material on which the normal form of said vat dye has been deposited, the acidity of the aqueous mixture so formed being controlled so as to give a finalpH value of less than 8.0. The manner of preparing and using the aqueous solutions of this invention will now be described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof so as to enable those skilled in the art to practice the same The sulfite borohydride solutions of the invention may be prepared either from a solid borohydride salt in water containing, if desired, sufficient hydroxide base to stabilize the borohydride ion buy retarfling its hydrolysis. The borohydride salt may be dissolved in water together with sufficient hydroxide base to ensure that the final pH value after preparation of the solution of the invention, is greater than 8.0. If a previously prepared borohydride solution does not contain su Eficient hydroxide base to ensure that the required final pH is attained an additional quantity should be added thereto. To the borohydride solution may then be added a desired sulfite, or bisulfite, in solid or in aqueous solution, aqueous sulfurous acid or gaseous or liquid sulfur dioxide until the desired mole ratio of greater than 6 to 1 of sulfite ions to borohydride ions is attained.The ratio of sulfite ions to borohydride ions is conveniently 7 1 to 9 1, preferably 8.0 1. If desired, the solution so prepared may be added to a water solution of a non borohydride reducible acid containing a sufficient quantity of said acid to ensure that the solution resulting from such addition will have a final pH of less than 8.0., thereby generating hydrosulfite ion in said final solution. The hydrosulfite solution so generated may then be employed in conventional hydrosulfite bleaching procedures for the treatment of groundwood or thermomechanical paper pulps, clay leaching or the vat dyeing of textile materials. If desired, the sulfite borohydride solution may be added directly to the pulp, clay or textile dyeing solution or suspension in which it is desired to have hydrosulfite ion present. One may rely on the inherent acidity of such solutions or suspensions, or one may add additional acid, previously, simultaneously and or subsequently, to provide a final pH of below 8.0. These skilled in the art will recognize that in selecting an appropriate borohydride and, if desired, a sulfite salt as well as hydroxide bases for the preparation of the sulfite borohydride solution, the particular cation or cations introduced are not particularly critical and may largely be chosen at the option of the operator based on price, commercial availability, solubility and the desirability of fits presence in subsequent processing. The techniques of conversion of a particular salt or base from one cationic form to another are well known. Conventional cation exchange techniques employing commercially available ion exchange resins may be employed, for example. Because of their solubility, low price and availability compounds using alkali metals such as potassium or sodium, particularly sodium, are preferred. The terms acid, base and acid capacity have the usual meanings of those terms in relation to aqueous or substantially aqueous solution. Normally an acid is a proton donor, a base a proton acceptor and a hydroxide base, a base which on solution in water generates an excess of hydroxyl ions which are proton acceptors. It is understood that a proton is conventionally thought of in aqueous solution as solvated with one molecule of water. Acid capacity means having sufficient protons or their equivalent to neutralize a desired amount of base so that a desired pH level will be attained. Typical acids which are not reducible by borohydride ion are the hydrohalide acids such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen bromide mineral acids such as H2S04, H PO H SiC and more complex silicic acids and H 3BC H3BOD, as well as organic carboxylic, dicarboxylic, and substituted amine carboxylic acids. Hydroxide bases employed in ensuring that the initially prepared sulfite borohydride solutions will have pH values greater than 8 may be any readily water soluble hydroxide such as the alkali metal hydroxides, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide is preferred. When less soluble cations are present and or for solution stability at higher concentration levels various chelating and or complexing agents such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and its salts may be employed. It wil be understood that the exact concentration of borohydride, sulfite or hydroxyl ions in aqueous solution up to the limits of solubility is not particularly critical so long as the pH of the storage stable solution is greater than 8.0 and the relative proportion of 6.0 moles or more of sulfite ion for each mole of borohydride ion is maintained. For example with sodium ion as the anion the solution may contain from about 0.1 to about 2.0 weight of NaBH4, from about 10.0 to about 30.0 weight of Na2S03 and from about 1.0 to about 6.0 weight of NaOH. The following examples further illustrate the best method known to us for performing this invention.
