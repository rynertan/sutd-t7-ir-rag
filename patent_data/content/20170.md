# Batter formulation and method of preparing same.

## Abstract
Improved batter formulations for making high ratio cakes, along with corresponding methods, are provided which allow complete elimination of treated e.g., chlorinated wheat fluor in the formulations without sacrifice of desirable organoleptic and structural properties in the end products. The batters include untreated wheat fluor either soft or hard and respective minor amounts of one or more selected proteins and unmodified starch e.g., wheat, corn or potato . In certain instance significant reductions in the amounts of shortening and or egg ingredients normally used can be made, without deleteriously affecting cake quality.
