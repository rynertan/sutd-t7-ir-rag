# A semiconductor switch device suitable for a.c. power control.

## Abstract
A semiconductor switch device suitable for a.c. power control includes three 4 layer switch components in parallel in a single body of semiconductor material. First and second components are of the same polarity and of opposite polarity to the third component. One end connection of the second component is taken out as a secondary gate connection sepa rate from the corresponding connections of the first and third components. In a preferred mode of use, the secondary gate connection is maintained at a d.c. potential relative to the corresponding connections of the first and third components so as to enable the second component to be conducting dur ing the zero crossings of the a.c. supply and able to maintain the internal voltages required for conduction of either or both of the other components. Circuits are given for integrated circuits embodying the device to permit zero voltage switch ing power controllers to be made with few external compo nents, and for a proportional controller providing a variable mark to space ratio in dependence upon a variable resistor.
