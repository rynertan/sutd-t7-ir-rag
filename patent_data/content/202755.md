## Description
The invention relates to a double heterojunction field effect transistor data storage device. In devices known as high electron mobility transistors HEMT , a number of electrons are trapped in a potential well which appears at a lattice matched heterojunction with a band offset. In such a structure when conduction in the channel of a Field Effect Transistor employs such a heterojunction, the speed of response substantially increases. Such a structure has been known also as a modulation doped and an electron gas type structure. Such a structure is disclosed in US A 4,163,237. The use of one material of the heterojunction as the gate of a FET with a contiguous region thereto used to move the potential well with respect to the Fermi level for the purpose of setting a specific threshold, is disclosed in EP A 114762. A semiconductor electronically erasable memory structure involving varying insulator properties adjacent to a silicon FET channel is shown in J Applied Phys The invention seeks to provide a double heterojunction field effect transistor data storage device. Such a device comprises, according to the invention, a substrate of single crystal semiconductor material having disposed therein spaced apart source and drain regions defining a channel region there between, a gate layer of single crystal semiconductor material which has a larger bandgap than that of the substrate, forming a heterojunction with the substrate and disposed over the channel region, a charge storage layer of semiconductor material forming a heterojunction with the gate layer and disposed over the channel region, the energy band difference between the gate and charge storage layers being substantially equal to that between the substrate and the gate layer, charge transfer means, having an asymmetric charge transfer characteristic, contiguous with the face of the charge storage layer opposite to that forming the heterojunction with the gate layer and charge introduction and removal means contiguous with the charge transfer means. How the invention can be carried out will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which The invention is concerned with a band offset heterojunction FET having a charge storage and removal capability that operates to position and retain, in the absence of signal, the potential well with respect to the Fermi level, so that the FET is either in a conducting or non conducting state. A charge is stored in a semiconductor region that forms a barrier with the gate of a band offset heterojunction FET and employs asymmetry in a second barrier to permit charge introduction and removal in response to a signal. In the following description of a preferred embodiment of the invention, reference is made to specific semiconductor materials, doping types and concentrations, and physical conduction mechanisms, however, in the light of the principles set forth, various substitutions will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Referring to Figure 1, the preferred embodiment has a substrate 1 formed of a first semiconductor having a relatively small band gap such as GaAs. A heterojunction interface 2 exists between the substrate 1 and a second semiconductor 3 having a wider band gap, such as Ga A charge transfer accommodation region 10 forms a barrier 11 with region 8. The charge transfer accommodation region transfers charge to the region 8 in the presence of a signal of one polarity, transfers charge out of the region 8 in the presence of a signal of the opposite polarity while operating to prevent change of charge state of the region 8 in the no signal condition. The region 10 is of Ga The structure of Figure 1 can be manufactured using most standard techniques in the art capable of crystal perfection, composition and doping control. A preferred technique because of low temperature operation and the ability to make abrupt change is the technique of molecular beam epitaxy. The structure of Figure 1 would be made with the substrate 1, region 8 and region 13 of n type GaAs and regions 3 and 10 of Ga The molecular beam epitaxy technique would provide successive layers on the interface 2 of the substrate. Referring to Figures 2 and 3, the first layer would be the Ga The remainder of region 10 to interface 14 would be grown at a constant value of x. The final layer would be GaAs grown on interface 14 with, referring to Figures 2 and 3, no A1 mole fraction and n dopant. The metal 15 would be vacuum evaporated. The energy band diagram of Figures 4 to 8 illustrates the operation of the device. Figure 4 shows the quiescent state of the device. Figures 5 and 6 show the way the structure provides the ability to store a charge in response to a signal that will position the potential well across the Fermi level with the condition being retained in the absence of signal. Figures 7 and 8 then show the way the charge is removed so that the potential well is no longer across the Fermi level, and that the condition is retained in the absence of signal. Referring to Figure 4, the energy band diagram of the structure of Figure 1 is shown in the quiescent state wherein the conduction band is in the vicinity of the Fermi level in the regions 13 and 8 and is above the Fermi level in the regions 10 and 3. The offset at the potential well at the interface 2 is above the Fermi level so that the device would not conduct. In Figure 5, a turn on signal is applied. This condition stores a charge in region 8 which in turn operates to position the potential well across the Fermi level at the interface 2 to establish the conditions for conduction. In Figure 6, when the signal is removed, the charge on region 8 placing the conduction band below the Fermi level cannot leak off due to the gradual shift to a higher band gap in the portion 12 of region 10. The charge in region 8 in turn retains the potential well across the Fermi level in the absence of signal. Thus, once set to on , the device conducts in the absence of any further signal. The band energy diagrams in Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the conditions for removal of the charge on region 8 producing the non conducting condition. Referring next to Figure 7, the relative positions of the band energy diagrams are shown under the conditions where an off signal is applied. The signal is of a polarity opposite to that of Figure 5 which operates to move the charge out of region 8 toward the inter face 2. The graded aspect of portion 12 of region 10 facilitates moving the charge out of region 10. The asymmetric barrier in region 10 could also be achieved by a tunnelling structure. In Figure 8, after the turn off signal is removed, the band energy diagram is such that the potential well is retained above the Fermi level and consequently no conduction takes place. With a signal applied between the substrate 1 and the gate contact 15, due to the asymmetric storage performance of the layer 10, charge can be removed via the gate electrode from the region 8 more easily than it can be added via the channel. This results in the quasi Fermi level of the layer 8 being closer to that of the top layer 13 than to the bottom layer 1. The structural configuration provides a charge which moves the conduction band with respect to the Fermi level such that a potential well can be positioned across the Fermi level in one condition at which point conduction can occur or the potential well can be removed from across the Fermi level so that conduction will not occur. In a preferred embodiment of the structure of Figure 1, the substrate 1 is of semi insulating GaAs and the regions 4 and 5 are doped with silicon to about 10ยนโธ atoms cc. The ohmic contacts 6 and 7 are standard alloyed AuGe based. The region 3 is substantially undoped GaA1As with the aluminium mole fraction being 0.5 so that it would be described as Ga In the preferred embodiment, each of the epitaxial regions 3, 8, 12 and 13 is about 50 nm thick. The gate structure can be delineated to permit application of the source 4 and drain 5 and contacts 6 and 7 by reactive ion etching or chemical etching. The difference in response to etching by GaAs and GaA1As is usable to expose the interface 2. The structure of Figure 1 is responsive to on and off signals in the 1 to 2 volt range. What has been described is a semiconductor storage device which provides reversible control by conduction in a band offset heterojunction FET by providing an asymmetric barrier controlled charge storage capability that can position a potential well across the Fermi level for conduction, and away from the Fermi level for non conduction and to retain in that position in the absence of a signal.
