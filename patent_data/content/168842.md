# FLOAT APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING LEAKS USING THE APPARATUS

## Abstract
Apparatus for detecting small changes in float position, to determine leaks from a liquid storage tank for example, has a float located at a particular depth such that tempera ture variations in the liquid do not result in spurious move ment of the float.
