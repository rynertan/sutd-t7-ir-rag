# Excitation current control for induction motor drive using load commutated inverter circuit.

## Abstract
A system for controlling the operation of an alternating current induction motor having windings supplied by elec trical power from the polyphase alternating current source includes a load commutated inverter circuit which is con nected between the power source and the induction motor for furnishing electrical power to the motor. Controllers responsive to a command signal and a feedback signal indicative of motor operating parameters control the opera tion of said load commutated inverter circuit. There is further provided a fixed capacitor circuit connected between the windings of the motor for supplying reactive volt amperes VARs to said load commutated inverter circuit and said motor. Finally, there is provided a variable VAR generator connected between the motor windings for supplying VARs to said load commutated inverter circuit and said motor in response to the output of a third feedback control path which is also responsive to a command signal and prescribed operating parameter s of said load and or said commutated inverter.
