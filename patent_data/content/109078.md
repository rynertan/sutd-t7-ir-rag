## Description
IMMUNOCHEMICAL ASSAY OF HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN AND REAGENT THEREFOR This invention relates to an immunochemical assay of human chorionic gonadotropin hereinafter sometimes referred to as hCG . Heretofore, two methods have been proposed for enzyme immunoassay hereinafter sometimes referred to briefly as EIA of hCG, as follows 1 Competitive method The assay is accomplished by allowing a reagent containing a definite amount of hCG labeled with an enzyme and a sample containing an unknown amount of hCG to become bound to a known amount of an anti hCG antibody competitively, assaying the enzymic activity of that portion of enzyme which has been bound to the antibody or remains unbound and comparing the assay result with the result obtained in the same manner with a known amount of hCG. 2 Sandwich method The assay is accomplished by trapping a sample containing an unknown amount of hCG with an anti hCG antibody supported on a carrier, allowing an enzyme labeled antibody to be bound to the resulting complex and assaying the enzymic activity. The present inventor has already found that the use of a certain ss D galactosidase as labeling agent and a certain antibody in the above mentioned competitive method 1 enables microassay of hCG with high sensitivity and high specificity cf. European Patent Application Publication No. 37,110 . The present inventor has also found that, in the above mentioned sandwich method 2 , an EIA which comprises using an antibody supported on the carrier and an antibody to which the labeling agent is coupled, and they are different antibodies which are not overlapping in antigen determining site and one of these different antibodies is specifically reactive to human chorionic gonadotropin, is highly sensitive, highly accurate and highly specific cf. European Patent Publication No.49,898 . However, even by these methods, it is difficult to assay hCG at levels of about 0.1 to 2 mIU or below.Accordingly, a still more highly sensitive assay method has been required for more decisive diagnosis of malignant tumor and observation of the course of such tumor as well as study of the physiological meaning of hCG in normal human subjects. Under these circumstances, the present inventor conducted further investigations and found that, in EIA by the sandwich method which uses the above mentioned specific antibody, the use of an antibody enzyme conjugate obtained by coupling an anti hCG antibody to peroxidase enables a highly sensitive, highly accurate microassay. Continued studies based on the above finding have now led to completion of the present invention. The present invention relates to 1 in an immunochemical assay of human chorionic gonadotropin involving the use of an antibody supported on a carrier, an antigen and an antibody labeled with a labeling agent, an improvement comprises in that said supported antibody and the labeled antibody are dissimilar antibodies which are not overlapping with each other in antigen determinant position, that the supported antibody is an antibody specifically reactive to human chorionic gonadotropin, that said labeling agent is peroxidase, and that the peroxidase is coupled with the corresponding antibody employing a compound represented by the formula EMI3.1 wherein n is an integer of 0 to 5 and R is a chemical bond or a divalent 6 membered cyclic hydrocarbon residue, and 2 an immunochemical assay reagents for use in an assay of human chorionic gonadotropin which comprises component a a reagent consisting of a conjugate which is prepared by coupling peroxidase with an antibody employing the compound of the formula I and component b an antibody supported on a carrier, the antibody being not overlapping in antigen determinant position with the antibody to be coupled with peroxidase and being specifically reactive to human chorionic gonadotropin. The carrier used in the present invention includes, among others, beads of gels off or example, agarose gel e.g. Sepharose 4B, Sepharose 6B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals,Sweden , dextran gel e.g. Sephadex G75, Sephadex G100,Sephadex G200 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , polyacrylamide gel e.g. Biogel P30, Biogel P60, Biogel P100 Bio RadLaboratories, U.S.A. , particles of cellulose for example, Avicel Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.Japan , ion exchange cellulose e.g. diethylaminoethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose , physical adsorbents for example, glass e.g. glass beads, glass rods, aminoalkylglass beads, aminoalkyl glass rods , silicone rubbers, styrene resin e.g. polystyrene beads, polystyrene granules , ion exchange resins ffor example, weakly acid cation exchange resins e.g. Amberlite IRC 50 Rohm andHaas, U.S.A. , Zeocarb 226 Permutit, West Germany , weakly basic anion exchange resins e.g. Amberlite IR 4B Rohm and Haas , Dowex 3 Dow Chemical, U.S.A. and so on. In accordance with this invention, the antibody supported on a carrier and the antibody coupled with a labeling agent are two dissimilar antibodies which are not overlapping with each other in antigen determinant position, and the antibody to be supported on the carrier is an antibody specifically reactive to hCG. As examples of the antibody specifically reactive to hCG, there is mentioned 1 an antibody described inEndocrinology, vol. 104 1979 , P. 396. Thus, an hCGspecific peptide at the C terminal of hCG ss sub unit and a carrier protein such as bovine albumin or bovinethyroglobulin are condensed in the presence of a watersoluble carbodiimide reagent such as l ethyl 3 3 dimethyl aminopropyl carbodiimide, and using the resulting condensate and Freund s complete adjuvant or incomplete adjuvant, a warm blooded animal such as rabbit is immunized a plurality of times to produce an antibody. This procedure gives an antiserum which reacts specifically to hCG. 2 An hCG specific anti hCG antibody described inEuropean Patent Application Publication No. 37,110 is mentioned. The antibody is prepared as follows The peptide of the formula VIII H e Pro Ser Asp Thr Pro Ile Leu Pro Gln OH VIII wherein Rlis a partial peptide of 1 to 14 amino acid residues including 14 Gly of the peptide Ala1 Pro2 Pro3 pro4 Ser5 leu6 pro7 Ser8 pro9 Serla Argll Leu12 pro13 Gly14 as immobilized on a carrier, is contacted with a body fluid containing an anti hCG antibody, and the anti hCG antibody specifically absorbed is separated by elution. 3 Furthermore, as an antibody which reacts specifically with hCG, there may be mentioned an antibody prepared by condensing a peptide of the formula tVIII mentioned above with a carrier protein in the presence of glutaraldehyde hereafter briefly, GLA , inoculating a warm blooded animal other than man with the resulting condensate to produce an antibody and recovering the same European Patent Application Publication No. 49,898 . The carrier protein referred to above is a substance which is used as coupled with a hapten a substance of low molecular weight for producing an antibody to the hapten such as a peptide which, as it is alone, cannot induce formation of an antibody, and includes such proteins as bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin, bovine thyroglobulin, tetanus toxoid, hemocyanin and polyamino acid. The coupling of the peptide of the formula VIII with a carrier protein in the presence of GLA can be conducted by the conventional method e.g. Hormone andMetabolic Research , vol 8 1976 P. 241 . The relative amount of peptide VIII and carrier protein is preferably about 1 1 to 2 1, and the reaction pH of about 7.3 gives satisfactory results in many cases. The reaction time is somewhere between about 2 and 6 hours and a reaction time of about 3 hours is usually appropriate. The condensation product thus obtained is dialyzed against water of about 40C, lyophilized and stored as usual. The condensation product thus obtained is used to inoculate a warm blooded animal other than man. The warm blooded animal other than man, which is used in the production of the above hCG specific antibody, includes, among others, mammalian warm blooded animals e.g. rabbit, sheep, rat, mouse, guinea pig, cattle, horse, pig and avian species e.g. chicken, pigeon, duck, goose, quail . To inoculate the condensation product into such a warm blooded animal other than man, the condensation product is used in an amount sufficient to produce the desired antibody. For example, 2 mg per dose of the condensation product is emulsified with equal volumes 1 ml of physiological saline and Freund s complete adjuvant and the emulsion is injected subcutaneously into dorsal sites and rear foot pads of a rabbit for a total of 5 times at intervals of 4 weeks. The above procedure yields the desired antibody in many instances. The antibody thus produced in the body of the warm blooded animal can be harvested as follows. Thus, in the case of a rabbit, for instance, blood is withdrawn from the ear vein and centrifuged to separate the serum normally at a time between 7 to 12 days after the last immunization. The carrier for supporting the antibody used as immobilized thereon in the assay of hCG may be any of the carriers mentioned above. The coupling of the carrier with the antibody or antigen may be effected by the conventional method. For example, the cyanogen bromide method as well as the GLA method described in Taisha Metabolism and Disease , vol, 8 1971 , P. 696 published by Nakayama Shoten Inc.,Japan may be mentioned. As a more expedient procedure, the antibody may be physically adsorbed on the surafce of the carrier. As examples of the peptide of the formula VIII , there is mentioned a C terminal fragment peptide IX of hCG ss 123 145 represented by the formula H Ala Pro Pro Pro Ser Leu Pro Ser Pro Ser Arg Leu Pro Gly Pro Ser Asp Thr Pro Ile Leu Pro Gln OH. The fragment is produced, for example, by a method described in European PatentApplication Publication No. 37,110. Throughout this specification, when abbreviations are used to amino acids, peptides, etc., they are either the abbreviations according to IUPAC IUB Commission onBiochemical Nomenclature or those of common use in this field of art. The following is a partial list of the abbreviations. It is to be understood that when optical isomers exist in regard to amino acids, etc., L forms are meant unless otherwise indicated. Ala alanine Pro proline Ser serine Leu leucine Arg Arginine Gly glycine Asp aspartic acid Thr threonine Ile isoleucine Gln glutamine The various peptides which are employed for the production of the specific antibody according to the present invention can be produced by procedures known per se. While both of the solid phase and the liquidphase methods of synthesis may be employed, the latter method is more often advantageous.Such methods for peptide synthesis include those described in the literature, e.g. Schroder and Lubke The Peptides, vol. 1 1966 ,Academic Press, New York, U.S.A. and Izumiya et al. Peptide Gosei Peptide Synthesis 1975 , Maruzen Co.,Ltd., Japan, namely the azide method, chloride method, acid anhydride method, mixed acid anhydride method, DCC method, active ester method, Woodward Reagent K method, carbodiimidazole method, reduction oxidation method, DCCadditive e.g. HONB, HOBt, HOSu method and so on. The coupling of the carrier with the specific antiboty may be effected by the conventional method. For example, the cyanogen bromide method as well as the GLA method described in the aforementioned Metabolism andDisease , vol 8 1971 , P. 696 published by NakayamaShoten Inc., Japan may be mentioned. As a more expedient procedure, the antibody may be physically adsorbed on the surface of the carrier. The antigen in the assay according to the invention is the assay target, namely hCG. Referring to the antibody labeled with a labeling agent to be used in the practice of the invention, the antibody therein is nonspecifically reactive with hCG and has an antigenic determinant which does not overlap with any of the antigen determinant position of the abovementioned antibody supported on a carrier. An example of the antibody nonspecifically reactive to hCG is the antibody which shows cross reactivity with other structurally analogous protein hormones such as hLH human luteinizing hormone , which antibody may be prepared by inoculating a warm blooded animal other than a human being with a purified hCG derived from human urine in the conventional manner to produce an anti hCG antibody, subjecting the same antibody to salting out to recover y globulin fraction, subjecting the same fraction to affinity chromatography on a column packed with a solid phase coupled with the C terminal peptide of hCG B to recover an effluent and purifying the effluent further by affinity chromatography on a column of a solid phase with which hCG has been coupled. The labeling agent, namely peroxidase, may be of any of various origins. For example, peroxidase species of the horseradish, pineapple, fig, sweet potato, broad bean and corn origins are usable. In particular, horseradish peroxidase extracted from horseradish is preferable. In coupling peroxidase to the antibody, a compound of the formula EMI8.1 wherein n and R are defined as above, is used. In the above formula, the divalent 6 membered cyclic hydrocarbon residue represented by R may be either saturated or unsaturated. Examples of the saturated divalent 6membered cyclic hydrocarbon residue are 1,2 , 1,3 and 1,4 cyclohexylene. Examples of the unsaturated 6 membered cyclic hydrocarbon residue are 1,2 , 1,3 and 1,4 phenylene. In said compound I , n is preferably an integer of 1 to 5, and more preferably the integer 1. As the divalent 6 membered cyclic hydrocarbon residue R, 1,4 cyclohexylene is particularly preferable. The compound I to be used in the method of the present invention can be produced, for example, by the methods described in The Journal of Biochemistry, vol. 79, page 233 1976 , European Journal of Biochemistry, vol.101, page 395 1979 , Japanese Patent Application Laidopen No. Sho 52 1977 85,163, Japanese Patent ApplicationLaid open No. Sho 52 1977 85,164 and German PatentApplication Offenlegungsschrift 2656155 or modifications thereof. Thus, for instance, it can be produced by reacting a maleimide compound of the formula EMI9.1 wherein X is a hydroxyl group or a halogen atom and n andR are as defined above, with a succinimide compound of the formula EMI9.2 wherein Y is a hydrogen atom or an alkali metal atom, in the presence of a dehydrating agent or a deacidifying agent. Referring to the above formulas, the halogen atom is, for example, chlorine or bromine, and the alkali metal atom is, for instance, sodium or potassium. Examples of the dehydrating agent to be used in the reaction are sulfuric acid and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.Pyridine and triethylamine are examples of the deacidifying agent. The above mentioned compound tII can be produced for example, by the method described in Japanese PatentApplication Laid open No. 52 1977 85,164 or a modification thereof. Thus, for instance, it can be obtained by subjecting a compound tIV of the formula EMI10.1 wherein n and R are as defined above, to dehydration under ring closure. Said dehydration ring closure reaction can be effected by gentle heating with a dehydrating agent such as acetic anhydride or acetic anhydride plus sodium acetate anhydrous . Alternatively, it can also be produced by the method described in Helvetica Chimica Acta, vol. 58 1975 , page 531 or a modification thereof. Thus, for instance, anN alkoxycarbonylmaleimide V of the formula EMI10.2 wherein Z is, an alkyl group, with an amino acid VI of the formula NH2 CH2 RCOOH VI wherein n and R are as defined above, to give a maleimide compound VII of the formula EMI10.3 wherein n and R are as defined above. Then, a succinimide compound tIII is added and the reaction is carried out in the presence of a dehydrating or deacidifying agent such as mentioned above, to give the compound tI . Referring to the compound of the formula V , the alkyl represented by Z is, for example, methyl or ethyl. The reaction of compound tI with peroxidase is accomplished by contacting both with each other in a buffer having a pH of about 6 to 8 at a temperature of about 100C to 500C for about 10 minutes to 24 hours. Said buffer is, for example, 0,1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 or 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 6.3 . The thus obtained maleimidated peroxidase can be purified by gel chromatography, for instance. Packing materials adequate for said gel chromatography areSephadex G 25 Pharmacia Fine Chemical, Sweden andBiogel P 2 Bio Rad Laboratories, U.S.A. , among others. An exemplary method for reacting the maleimidated peroxidase with an anti hCG antibody is described below.The anti hCG antibody IgG or the F ab 2 fraction obtained by pepsin degradation is reduced in the presence of a mercaptoethylamine and the unreacted material is removed by gel filtration. The resultant anti hCG antibody IgG or Fab is reacted with the maleimidated peroxidase. Said reaction can be effected by contacting both with each other in a buffer at a temperature of about OOC to 400C for about 1 to 48 hours. Said buffer is, for example, 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 5 mM sodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate pH 6.0 . The thus produced peroxidase labeled antibody can be purified by gel chromatography, for instance. As the packing material for use in said gel chromatography, there may be mentioned, among others, Ultrogel AcA 44 LKB,Sweden and Sephacryl S 200 Pharmacia Fine Chemical,Sweden . Thus obtained peroxidase labeled antibody is presumed to have the following structure EMI11.1 wherein R and n are the same meaning as defined above, Ab means a residue of the antibody Ab SH , and Per is a residue of peroxidase Per NH2 . The assay procedure according to the present invention is described in more detail hereinbefore. 1 First, an hCG containing sample to be assayed is added to the antibody supported on a carrier, whereupon the antigen antibody reaction takes place. Thereafter, the peroxidase coupled anti hCG antibody IgG or Fab obtained in the above manner is added for reaction. As the hCG containing sample to be assayed by the enzyme immunoassay method according to the present invention, there may be mentioned urine, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and various internal organ extracts, among others. Among them, urine, serum and plasma are most frequently used. 2 A substrate for peroxidase is added to the reaction product obtained in 1 , and the absorbance or fluorescence intensity of the substance produced is measured. The enzymic activity of the above mentioned reaction product is known in this manner. 3 The above serial procedures 1 and 2 is followed with standard solutions containing known amounts of hCG and a standard curve indicating the relationship between the hCG level and the absorbance or fluorescence intensity is constructed in advance. 4 The hCG content in the test sample is determined by conversion of the absorbance or fluorescence intensity obtained with the test sample containing an unknown amount of hCG using the standard curve. An assay kit suited for use in immunochemical assay of hCG by the sandwich method according to the present invention mainly comprises 1 the antibody supported on a carrier, 2 the peroxidase labeled antibody fragment Fab obtained by the method of the present invention, 3 a standard hCG, 4 a buffer for diluting the above reagents 2 and 3 and a test sample e.g. phosphate or glycine buffer having a pH of about 6 to 9 and containing about 10 of sheep serum and about 1 of bovine serum albumin hereinafter sometimes referred to as BSA in each of which serum and proteinic substances are coexisting , and 5 reagents necessary for determination of peroxidase activity e.g. p hydroxyphenylacetic acid as substrate and hydrogen peroxide for fluorescent assay o phenylenediamine and hydrogen peroxide for colorimetry a buffer for dissolving the substrate, preferably phosphate buffer and an enzymic reaction terminator solution . The above kit can be used, for instance, in the following manner About 10 to 200 p1 of the standard hCG or test liquid is diluted with the reagent 4 . Then, an adequate amount of the reagent 1 is added. After about 1 to 48 hours of reaction at about 0 to 400C, the carrier is washed with water and, then, about 10 to 300 p1 of the reagent 2 is added. After about 1 to 48 hours of reaction at 0 to 400C, the carrier is washed and the activity of peroxidase on the carrier is determined.Thus, about 10 to 1,000 pl of a solution of a peroxidase substrate is added and the enzymic reaction is allowed to proceed at about 200C to 400C for about 0.2 to 24 hours and then terminated, followed by determination of the absorbance or fluorescence intensity of the liquid reaction mixture. The reagents for immunochemical assay in accordance with the present invention enables a highly sensitive assay of hCG by a simple procedure in a usual clinical laboratory. When the reagents according to the invention is used, hCG can be assayed with very high sensitivity and accuracy without suffering interference by similar hormones e.g.hLH luteinizing hormone . Accordingly, the present invention provides a means very useful also for diagnosis and prognosis of chorionic tumor and other types of hCGproducing tumor, among others.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 shows the gel chromatographic elution patterns of the reaction product of peroxidase with rabbit antihCG antibody Fab fragment in Example 1 Fig. 2 shows the standard curves of hCG and hLH in the EIA using the peroxidase labeled anti hCG antibody Fab fragment and hCG specific antibody polystyrene bead in Example 1 andFig. 3 shows the standard curve of hCG in the singleincubation assay in Example 2. The following Reference Examples and Examples are given to illustrate the present invention in further detail. Reference Example 1Production of anti hCG antibody anti hCG serum In 1 ml of physiological saline was dissolved 1 mg of hCG approx. 10,000 IU mg purified from the human urine by the conventional method, and 1 ml of Freund s complete adjuvant Tachibana et al. Men eki no SeiMagaku Biochemistry of Immunity , p. 26, Kyoritsu Shuppan Inc.Japan 1967 was added and stirred well to prepare an emulsion. This emulsion was injected into the bilateral femoral muscles and subcutaneously at several dorsal sites of a rabbit. The above procedure was repeated at intervals of 3 weeks for a total of 5 times and a blood sample was taken one week after the last immunization for a pilot assay. In this manner, there was obtained an anti serum N305B having an affinity also for the Cterminal fragment peptide IX of hCG ss. Reference Example 2Production of specific anti hCG antibody Five 5 mg of peptide IX was dissolved in 8 ml of 0.1 M NaHCO3 containing 0.5 M NaCl. To this solution was added 1 g of BrCN activated Sepharose 4B previously washed with 1 1,000 N HC1. The mixture was stirred at 50C overnight. Then, the Sepharose was washed well with the 0.1 M NaHCO3 solution containing 0.5 M NaCl as used above, followed by addition of 10 ml of 0.5 M ethanolamine adjusted to pH 8 with hydrochloric acid. The reaction was conducted at room temperature for one hour, after which time the Sepharose was washed with 1 0.1 M acetate buffer containing 1 M NaCl pH 4.0 , 2 0.1 M borate buffer containing 1 M NaCl pH 8.0 and 3 0.02 M borate buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl pH 8.0 in the order mentioned.The Sepharose was then packed into a column. Eight 8 ml of the anti hCG serum N305B obtained according to Reference Example 1 was subjected to fractional precipitation with 1.5 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate and the resultant y globulin fraction was passed through the above column of peptide IX Sepharose 4B column size 0.9 x 4 cm . The column was washed with 0.02 M borate buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl pH 8.0 to remove the anti hCG antibodies showing cross reactivity with hLH, hFSH human follicle stimulating hormone and hTSH human thyroidstimulating hormone . Then, elution was carried out with 0.17 M glycine HCl buffer pH 2.3 to recover the specific anti hCG antibody N305BS having a strong affinity for theC terminal fragment peptide IX of HCG S Protein content 1.2 mg . Reference Example 3Production of anti hCG B C terminal fragment peptide IX antibody In 4 ml of 0.2 M phosphate buffer pH 7.3 were dissolved 25 mg of the C terminal peptide IX of hCG 6 and 50 mg of bovine thyroglobulin briefly, BTG , followed by addition of 4 ml of 5 aqueous GLA. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, after which it was dialyzed against water at 40C 2 Q of water x 4 and lyophilized to obtain an immunogen. In 0.75 ml of physiological saline was dissolved 1.5 mg of the above hCG B C terminal peptide IX BTG conjugate, followed by addition of 0.75 ml of Freund s complete adjuvant. The mixture was stirred well to prepare an emulsion. The emulsion was injected intramuscularly into bilateral femoral muscles and subcutaneously several dorsal sites of a rabbit.The above procedure was repeated four times at intervals of 4 weeks and the blood was collected a week after the last immunization, centrifuged to separate the antiserum. In the above manner, anti hCG ss C terminal peptide IXj serum N313B was obtained. This antiserum N313B was precipitated with ammonium sulfate in the conventional manner and the resulting yglobulin fraction was applied to a Sepharose 4B column 0.9 cm dia. x 4 cm long carrying 2 mg of hCG. The column was washed with 0.02 M borate buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl pH 8.0 and elution was carried out with 0.17 M glycine HCl buffer pH 2.3 , whereby a specific antibody N313BS having a high affinity for hCG was obtained. Reference Example 4Production of nonspecific anti hCG antibody Antiserum N305B obtained in Reference Example 1 was salted out with ammonium sulfate and subjected to affinity chromatography using a column 0.9 cm in diameter and 4 cm in length of Sepharose 4B coupled with 5 mg of theC terminal peptide IX of hCG ss. An antibody fraction was recovered as the effluent. This fraction was then passed through a column 0.9 cm in diameter and 4 cm in length of Sepharose 4B coupled with 2 mg of hCG. The column was washed with 0.02 M borate buffer pH 8.0 containing 0.15 M NaCl and then eluted with 5 M MgC12 to give nonspecific antibody N305BG having high affinity to hCG. Example 1 1 Introduction of maleimide group In 1 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 , there was dissolved 6 mg of horseradish peroxidase BoehringerMannheim, West Germany , followed by addition of 4.8 mg of a coupling agent, MMC the compound of the formula I wherein nel and R cyclohexylene , dissolved in 50 pl ofN,N dimethylformamide. The mixture was stirred at 300C for 60 minutes. After the reaction, the resultant precipitate was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was passed through a Sephadex G 25 column 1.0 x 45 cm , followed by elution with 0.1 M phosphate buffer. A protein containing fraction was collected and concentrated with a collodion membrane.The thus prepared maleimidated peroxidase contained 1.0 to 1.2 maleimide groups introduced per one molecular of peroxidase calculation was made on the assumption that the molecular weight of peroxidase was was 40,000 and E1 0 nm 22.75 . 2 Production of maleimidated peroxidase anti hCG antibody Fab fragment complex To 5 mg of antibody N305BG obtained in ReferenceExample 4 was added 0.1 mg of pepsin, followed by overnight reaction at 300C. The reaction mixture was passed through a Sephadex G 150 column 2.5 cm in diameter and 55 cm in length . The thus purified antibody F ab 2 fraction was reduced with 2 mercaptoethylamine, followed by purification by gel chromatography using a Sephadex G 25 column to give rabbit anti hCG antibody Fab fragment . To a solution of 1.5 mg of the maleimidated peroxidase prepared in 1 above in 0.15 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.0 , there was added 0.15 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.0 containing 1.8 mg of the previously obtained anti hCG antibody Fab fragment and 5 mM sodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate. After 20 hours of reaction at 40C, the reaction mixture was subjected to gel chromatography using a column 1.5 x 45 cm packed with Ultrogel AcA 44. Elution was performed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.5 . The absorbance at 280 nm and enzymic activity of the eluate were determined. The formation of a peroxidase rabbit anti hCG antibody Fab fragment complex was confirmed by the following method. First, the enzymic activity was determined by the method of Gilbert et al. Analytical Chemistry, vol. 40 1968 , page 1256 . Thus, each eluate fraction was diluted 1,800 times with 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.1 of bovine serum albumin. To 10 pl of each dilution was added 0.25 ml of a 0.5 solution of phydroxyphenylacetic acid in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 containing 0.1 of bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation at 300C for 20 minutes. Thereafter, 0.05 ml of 0.01 hydrogen peroxide was added, followed by reaction at 300C for 20 minutes.The enzymic reaction was terminated by addition of 2.5 ml of 0.1 M glycine buffer pH 10.3 and the intensity of fluorescence was measured at 405 nm excitation light wavelength 320 nm regarding the intensity of fluorescence emitted by 1 pg ml of quinine as 100. The results obtained are shown inFig. 1. In Fig. 1, o indicates the absorbance at 280 nm and o indicates the peroxidase activity in terms of fluorescence intensity . It was confirmed that the formation of the peroxidase anti hCG antibody Fab fragment complex was very well recognizable in fraction 38 and neighboring fractions. 3 Preparation of antibody coupled solid phase To 1,500 polystyrene beads 4.8 mm in diameter,Precision Plastics Ball Co., Chicago, U.S.A. were added 100 ml of 15 pg ml solution of specific anti hCG antibodyN305BS or N313BS mentioned in Reference Example 2 or 3, respectively, in 0.01 M NaCl 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 8.0 . After overnight incubation at 50C, the beads were washed with 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.1 of BSA and stored in the cool until use thereof. 4 EIA The following EIA reagents were used. 1 The peroxidase rabbit anti hCG antibody Fab fragment complex according to Example 1 2 . 2 The anti hCG antibody coupled polystyrene bead according to Example 1 3 . 3 Standard hCG and hLH solutions. 4 Buffer B a 0.02 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 10 normal sheep serum, 1 bovine serum albumin, 0.1 NaN3 and 0.15 M Nail. 5 The reagents for determination of peroxidase activity a 0.1 M citric acid disodium phosphate buffer pH 4.8 containing 0.02 hydrogen peroxide and 0.15 o phenylenediamine and a reaction terminator 1 N HCl . Assay Either hCG or hLH was reacted with the rabbit antihCG coupled polystyrene bead in 200 ul of buffer B at room temperature for 1 day. After the polystyrene bead was washed with water, 300 pl of peroxidase rabbit antihCG antibody Fab fragment complex was added and the reaction was conducted at 40C for 1 day. After washing the polystyrene bead, 500 pl of a 0.1 M citric aciddisodium phosphate buffer pH 4.8 containing 0.02 hydrogen peroxide and 0.15 o phenylenediamine was added.The reaction system was allowed to stand at room temperature for 40 minutes, at the end of which time 2 ml of 1N hydrochloric acid was added to thereby terminate the reaction. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 492 nm. The standard curves constructed in the above manner are shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, represents the standard curve of hCG for the N305BSpolystyrene bead o the standard curve of hLH for theN305BS polystyrene bead s the standard curve of hCG for the N313BS polystyrene bead and the standard curve of hLH for the N313BS bound polystyrene bead. Thus, the assay method of the present invention was highly specific and sensitive to hCG without the interference of cross reaction with hLH. Example 2Expedient assay Standard hCG, the peroxidase anti hCG antibody Fabl fragment complex according to Example 1 2 , and one anti hCG antibody N305BS polystyrene bead according to Example 1 3 were simultaneously mixed together in 300 ul of a 0.02 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 25 normal sheep serum, 1 bovine serum albumin, 0.002 merthiolate and 0.15 M NaCl and reacted at 40C for 1 day.After the polystyrene bead was washed with water, peroxide dase activity was determined by the procedure described in Example 1 4 . As shown in Fig. 3, a satisfactory standard curve of hCG was obtained. Example 3 m Maleimidoben zoyl N hydroxysuccinimide MBS coupling method In 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 was dissolved 6 mg of horseradish peroxidase fBoehlinger Mannheim, WestGermany followed by addition of 4.8 mg of the coupling agent MBS the compound of the formula I wherein n 0,R phenylene as dissolved in 50 pl of N,N dimethyl formamide. The reaction was conducted under stirring at 250C for 30 minutes and the reaction mixture was then passed through a Sephadex G 25 column 1.0 x 45 cm , and eluted with 0.05 M acetate buffer pH 5.0 . The proteincontaining fraction was taken and concentrated through a collodion membrane. The number of maleimide groups in the maleimidated peroxidase per one mole of peroxidase was 0.68 to 0.78. To 5 mg of the antibody N305BG according to ReferenceExample 4 was added 0.1 mg of pepsin and the reaction was conducted at 300C overnight. The reaction product was then purified by passing through a Sephadex G 150 column 2.5 cm dia. x 55 cm long . The resulting antibody F ab 2 fraction was reduced with 2 mercaptoethylamine and, then, purified by gel chromatography on a Sephadex G 25 column to give a rabbit anti hCG antibody Fab fragment . A solution 0.15 ml of 1.7 mg of anti hCG antibody Fab fragment in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.0 containing 5 mM sodium ethylenediaminetetracetate was added to 0.15 ml of a solution containing 1.5 mg of the maleimidated peroxidase prepared above in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.0 and the reaction was conducted at 40C for 20 hours.The reaction mixture was then subjected to gel chromatography on an Ultrogel AcA 44 column 1.5 x 45 cm and elution was carried out with 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.5 to give a peroxidase rabbit anti hCG antibody Fab fragment complex. Assays using this complex by the procedure described in Example 1 2 and C4 showed that it was highly sensitive, with a very low non specific adsorption on the solid phase.

After washing the polystyrene bead with water, 300 p1 of reagent 2 as diluted with reagent 6 about 30 ng as the complex was added and the reaction was conducted at 40C for 1 day.After the polystyrene bead was washed with water, 500 pl of a 0.15 solution of reagent 5 in reagent 7 was added. The reaction was conducted at room temperature for 40 minutes, at the end of which time 1.5 ml of 1 N hydrochloric acid was added to thereby terminate the reaction. The absorbance was then measured at 492 nm. As to standard hCG solutions, the above procedure was repeated using 200 ul of reagent 4 , 50 ul of control serum, and one bead of reagent 1 to construct a standard cureve. The hCG concentrations in the sera of healthy subjects, ovariectomized patients, women in the ovulation phase, pregnant women and patients who had undergone carcinectomy for choriocarcinoma were determined by the procedure set forth hereinbefore. The results are shown in Table 1.
