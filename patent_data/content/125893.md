# THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF ANTIGEN BY THE ENZYME ANTIBODY BRIDGE METHOD

## Abstract
An improved method for the quantitative analysis of anti gen by an enzyme antibody bridge method, which comprises binding 1 an insoluble carrier or a coated insoluble carrier with 2 an antibody being capable of recognizing an antigen first antibody , 3 an antigen to be determined, 4 an anti body being capable of recognizing an antigen originated from an animal species different from the animal species of the first antibody second antibody , 5 an anti immunoglobulin anti body being capable of recognizing an immunoglobulin of the same animal species as that of the second antibody, 6 an anti enzyme antibody prepared by using the same animal species as that of the second antibody, 7 an enzyme in this order, and then measuring the amount of the enzyme in the resulting enzyme anti enzyme antibody complex, and deter mining the amount of the antigen therefrom. Said improved method gives a high sensitivity and hence can also be used for the measurement of very low concentration of an antigen.
