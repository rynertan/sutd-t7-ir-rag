## Description
BLENDS OF POLY ARYLENE ETHER KETONES AND TETRAFLUOROETHYLENE COPOLYMERS The invention relates to novel compositions comprising a first polymer component comprising a poly arylene ether ketone and a second polymer component comprising a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene. Poly arylene ether ketones are linear thermoplastic polymers that exhibit excellent mechanical, physical, chemical and electrical properties, and are especially useful for their superior thermal properties. These polymers can be molded by conventional techniques into shaped articles for a wide variety of end uses. These polymers are ductile, machinable, self extinguishing and relatively inert to most aqueous mineral acids. Bowever, it has been found that poly arylene ether ketones exhibit crazing under certain conditions of strain induced by certain solvents and are stiff and relatively inflexible. Copolymers of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene are known in the art. In US Patent No. 3,467,635 such copolymers are crosslinked with a curing agent such as a peroxide or an amine. In US Patent No. 3,718,558 copolymers are described which have been crosslinked using high energy ionizing radiation, such as an electron accelerator. High mechanical strength copolymers of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene are described in US Patent No.3,825,510. Such polymers absorb mineral acids. Copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene and vinylidine fluoride are also known. These copolymers are recognized as appreciably different in properties from copolymers of vinylidine fluoride and hexafluoropropylene alone.See U.S. Patent No. 3,306t879. These patents are incorporated herein by reference. Poly arylene ether ketones and copolymers of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene have previously been independently mixed with other polymers. In US Patent 4,395,512 copolymers of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene are mixed with a polyphenylenesulfide. The mixtures exhibit improved impact resistance but do not exhibit reduced mineral acid absorption. In U.S. Patent No. 3,400,065 blends of poly arylene ethers with copolymers of vinylidene fluoridehexafluoropropylene Viton A from DuPont are disclosed. It is reported that the poly arylene ether can be a poly arylene ether ketone . However, only one poly arylene ether ketone is used in a working example and it is one which can be processed at relatively low temperatures. It has been found that poly arylene ether ketones requiring higher processing temperatures cannot be successfully blended with vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene copolymers.The invention relates to novel compositions comprising an admixture of a a semi crystalline, thermoplastic poly arylene ether ketone having a crystalline melting point above about 3200C and b a substantially noncrystalline fluorocarbon polymer capable of withstanding temperature above about 320 C for at least about 5 minutes without substantial degradation, said fluorocarbon polymer comprising a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene wherein the tetrafluoroethylene content of the copolymer is about 5 to about 85 by weight based on the weight of the copolymer, said composition being capable of being melt processed at a temperature above the crystalline melting point of the poly arylene ether ketone .In a preferred embodiment, the second polymer component comprises a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and a propylene b vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylenet or c perfluoroalkylvinylether. It is further preferred that the poly arylene ether ketone is a continuous phase. ft ii further preferred that the fluorocarbon polymer is a dispersed phase. The compositions of the invention exhibit improved resistance to solvents, are less stiff, and exhibit improved dielectric properties when compared with poly arylene ether ketones alone and are processable at high temperature. The invention further relates to articles and substrate coatings comprising said composition. The fluorocarbon polymer used in the composition of the invention is substantially non crystalline and is capable of withstanding temperatures above about 320ÂµC for at least about 5 minutes without substantial degradation. By substantially non crystalline is meant that the polymer unlike tetrafluoroethylene homopolymer, exhibits little or no crystallinity. The fluorocarbon polymer utilized in this invention is a co or terpolymer containing tetrafluoroethylene TFE units. Generally the TFE units comprise from about 5t, preferably from about 10 , more preferably, from about 158 to about 85 , preferably to about 70t, more preferably, to about 50 by weight of the copolymer. The exact proportion may vary slightly depending on the other monomer s selected. The other monomers which can be used to copolymerize with tetrafluoroethylene include any monomer which copolymerizes with tetrafluoroethylene to produce a noncrystalline polymer. It is preferred that if the monomer selected for the copolymer is propylene, the monomer be substantially alternating with the TFE. When selecting a monomer or monomers for incorporation in the second polymer component where said monomer is sensitive to thermal chain scission after polymerization, it is then preferred that the thermally sensitive monomer be incorporated into the copolymer such that no more than 2 and preferably no more than 1 consecutive thermally sensitive monomer unit occur in the copolymer. For example, when the monomer selected is propylene, it is preferred that only 1 consecutive propylene unit occur in the copolymer.If 2 consecutive propylene units are to occur at all in the copolymer, the incidence thereof should be limited to about 1 or 2 times in the entire copolymer molecule. Monomers which can be copolymerized with tetrafluoroethylene include but are not limited to, for example propylene, vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropylene, perfluoroalkylvinylether, ethylene, butylene, isobutylene, methylvinylether, ethylvinylether, propylvinylether, isopropylvinylether, the various isomeric butyl vinyl ethers, 2 ethylhexylvinylether, n dodecylvinylether, nhexadecylvinylether, n octadecyl vinylether, l isobutylene 3 , 5 dimethylhexylvinylether, 2 methoxyvinylether, 2 butoxyethylvinylether, 2 chloroethyl vinylether, 2 bromoethylvinylether, 2 iodoethylvinyl ether,2 formamidoethylvinylether, 2 acetamidoethyl vinylether, 2 octanoylaminoethylvinyl ether and 2hydroxyethylvinylether.

Semi crystalline, thermoplastic poly arylene ether ketones used in the invention should have a crystalline melting point above about 3200C. Semi crystalline polymers are those polymers having a crystalline portion and a noncrystalline portion. Such polymers exhibit a crystalline melting point. Poly arylene ether ketones suitable for use in this invention have the repeat units of the formula CO Ar CO Ar wherein Ar and Ar are aromatic moieties at least one of which contains a diaryl ether linkage forming part of the polymer backbone and wherein both Ar and Ar are covalently linked to the carbonyl groups through aromatic carbon atoms. Preferably, Ar and Ar are independently selected from substituted and unsubstituted phenylene and substituted and unsubstituted polynuclear aromatic moieties. The term polynuclear aromatic moieites is used to mean aromatic moieties containing at least two aromatic rings. The rings can be fused, joined by a direct bond or by a linking group. Such linking groups include for example, carbonyl, ether sulfone, sulfide, amide, imide, azo, alkylene, perfluoro alkylene and the like. As mentioned above, at least one of Ar and Ar contains a diaryl ether linkage. The phenylene and polynuclear aromatic moieties can contain substituents on the aromatic rings. These substi tuents should not inhibit or otherwise interfere with the polymerization reaction to any significant extent. Such substituents include, for example, phenyl, halogen, nitro, cyano, alkyl, 2 alkynyl and the like. Poly arylene ether ketones having the following repeat units the simplest repeat unit being designated for a given polymer are preferred EMI6.1 Poly arylene ether ketones can be prepared by known methods of synthesis. Preferred poly arylene ether ketones can be prepared by Friedel Crafts polymerization of a monomer system comprising I i phosgene or an aromatic diacid dihalide together with ii a polynuclear aromatic comonomer comprising a H Ar O Ar H b H Ar 0 n Ar H wherein n is 2 or 3 c H Ar O Ar CO Ar O Ar m H wherein m is 1, 2 or 3 or II an acid halide of the formula H Ar O l Ar CO p Ar 0 q AR CO rlk Ar CO Z wherein Z is halogen, k is 0, 1 or 2, p is 1 or 2, q is 0, 1 or 2 and r is 0, 1 or 2 or III an acid halide of the formula H Ar 0 Ar Y wherein n is 2 or 3 and Y is CO Z or CO Art CO Z where Z is halogen wherein each Ar is independently selected from substi tuted or unsubstituted phenylene, and substituted and unsubstituted polynuclear aromatic moieties free of ketone carbonyl or ether oxygen groups, in the presence of a reaction medium comprising A A Lewis acid in an amount of one equivalent per equivalent of carbonyl groups present, plus one equivalent per equivalent of Lewis base, plus an amount effective to act as a catalyst for the polymerization B a Lewis base in an amount from 0 to about 4 equivalents per equivalent of acid halide groups present in the monomer system C a non protic diluent in an amount from 0 to about 93 by weight, based on the weight of the total reaction mixture. The aromatic diacid dihalide employed is preferably a dichloride or dibromide. Illustrative diacid dihalides which can be used include, for exampleEMI8.1 Illustrated polynuclear aromatic comonomers which can be used with such diacid halides are a N Ar O Ar H, which includes, for example EMI9.1 b H Ar 0 n Ar H, which include, for example EMI9.2 c H Ar O Ar CO Ar O Ar m H, which includes, for example EMI9.3 and d H Ar 0 n Ar1 CO Ar O Ar m H which includes, for example EMI9.4 Monomer systems 21 and III comprise an acid halide.

In monomer system II, the acid halide is of the formula H Ar O Ar CO p Ar O q Ar CO r k Ar CO Z Such monomers include for example, where k 0EMI10.1 and where 1 EMI10.2 In monomer system III, the acid halide is of the formula H Ar O Ar Y Examples of such acid halides includeEMI11.1 It is to be understood that combinations of monomers can be employed. For example, one or more diacid dihalides can be used with one or more polynuclear aromatic comonomers as long as the correct stoichiometry is maintained. Further, one or more acid halides can be included.In addition monomers which contain other linkages such as those specified above, can be employed as long a one or more of the comonomers used contains at least one ether oxygen linkage. Such comonomers include for example EMI11.2 which can be used as the sole comonomer with an ether containing diacid dihalide or with phosgene or any diacid diha lide when used in addition to a polynuclear aromatic comonomer as defined in I ii a , I ii b , I ii c orI ii d . SimilarlyEMI12.1 can be used as a coonomer together with an ether containing polynuclear aromatic acid halide or as an additional como number together with a monomer system as defined in I. The monomer system can also contain up to about 30 mole t of a comonomer such as a sulfonyl chloride which polymerizes under Friedel Crafts conditions to provide ketone sulfone copolymers. Further details of this process for producing poly arylene ether ketones can be found in commonly assigned co pending U.S. application Serial No. 594,503, filed 3i March 1984, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Other processes for preparing these polymers can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,953,400, 3,956,240, 3,928,295, 4,176,222 and 4,320,220. The compositions of the invention can contain various additives, in order to give a desired property to the polymer composition. For example, stabilizers, reinforcing or non reinforcing fillers, pigments, carbon black, plasticizers, surfactants, processing aids, and the like can be present. Compatible or non compatible polymers may also be added to give a desired property. The invention also rela tes to a reinforced composition comprising the composition and a reinforcing component e.g. the addition of carbon or glass fibers or other polymeric fibers or the like such as polyamides thus providing a high strength polymer. Where appropriate minor amounts of additives may be copolymerized with the polymers or copolymers of the invention. The polymers or co polymers may also contain minor amounts of other copolymerizable components. For example, copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and propylene may contain minor amounts of copolymerizable components such as ethylene, isobutylene, acrylic acid, vinyl fluoride, hexafluoropropylene, vinylidine fluoride, chlorotrifluoroethylene, and chloroethylvinylether. While cure site monomers may be copolymerized into the polymers and copolymers of the invention without harm, attempts to chemically crosslink the composition may lead to processing difficulties. The compositions of the invention may be crosslinked by suitable high energy ionizing radiation including rays, rays, x rays, accelerating particle rays, neutron rays, and electron beams. Any type of ionizing radiation source is preferable such as cobalt 60, Cesum 137, Kryptron 83, atomic energy generators such as atomic reactors, various types of particle accelerators, x ray generators, and electron beam generators. It is more preferable to use gamma rays from a cobalt 60 source, beta particle rays and accelerated electrons. Some of the compositions of the invention may also be crosslinked by heat. The compositions can be prepared by any convenient technique. For example, the components can be prepared on a two roll mill, in an internal mixer such as a Brabender mixer or Banbury mixer, or in a single or twin screw extruder. They may also be prepared by precipitation from a solvent, or cast from solution or the like. A shaped article of the composition can be formed by any appropriate technique depending on the desired shape.Films or coatings of the composition can be formed by extrusion, spraying, spin coating or casting, and formed fibers by melt spinning or the like. Other articles may be injection molded, compression molded, pour molded, blow molded or the like with or without additives as previously described. The compositions of the invention can be used in a variety of shaped articles and coatings. So, for example, they could be shaped as films, sheets, pipes, rods, rings, membranes, powders or formula. They can be used as coatings such as for wire, pipes or the like. They can be used as sleeves, for example, on rollers in thermographic copy machines and the like. Further they can be used as shaped articles such as containers, clips, panels, devices and the like. In a preferred embodiment the invention relates to wire coatings. In another preferred embodiment the invention relates to a valve seat comprising the composition of the invention.Valve seats vary widely in the amount of wear and friction they must withstand. This depends greatly on the type of valve actually used. For example, a ball valve makes sliding contact and exhibits considerable friction, whereas a butterfly valve exhibits relatively slight friction. All valves seats, however, have in common the necessity to have mechanical properties that provide a seal. It has been found that poly arylene ether ketones are too hard to be capable of deformation required to provide a seal. The com positions of this invention provide an excellent seal.Further, the compositions exhibit excellent solvent resistance, are resistant to creep, and can withstand a high degree of wear and friction. The following examples are representative of the invention but not intended to be limiting. Substitution of additives, materials, polymer, and conditions which are obvious from this disclosure are within the contemplation of the invention.Example 1 Processing Blends of Victrex PEEK poly arylene ether ether ketone from ICI Formula IV and Aflas 100 H, a copolymer of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene from Asahi Glass and blends of the poly arylene ether ketone of formula I ketone and Aflas 100H were prepared from a dry blend of the components using a corotating twin screw extruder ZSK .Similar blends were also prepared substituting a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene Viton B from DuPont or Fluorel FLS2690 from 3M .
