# Vinylidene chloride copolymer aqueous latex composition.

## Abstract
Aqueous latex composition for use as a contact adhe sive comprising a mixture of an amorphous copolymer A and an amorphous copolymer B where A comprises units of vinylidene chloride, an internally plasticising comonomer like 2 ethylhexyl acrylate or n butyl acrylate, optionally vi nyl chloride and optionally a copolymerisable acid, and has Tg in the range 50 to 0 C, and B comprises units of vinyli dene chloride, an alkyl acrylate and or methacrylate or cer tain other comonomers, optionally vinyl chloride, and op tionally a copolymerisable acid, and has a Tg in the range 0 to 30 C.
