# Gravity pipe transport system.

## Abstract
This invention relates to apparatus for the pipe transport of material comprising non slurried solids particles by means of a pipe 10 which is generally upright. The material to be transported and also air are introduced at the top of the pipe. In order to prevent plug up of the pipe the material and air flow rates are controlled by means of a central processing unit. A plurality of monitors 28, 30, 32, 34 located along the length of the pipe 10 provide to the central processing unit CPU signals indicative of the pressure in the pipe at the various locations.
