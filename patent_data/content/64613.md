## Description
Semiconductor device The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and, more particularly, to a structure for improving the current balance between element units when a plurality of parallel element units are driven. In a semiconductor device having a plurality of element units, different currents flow through the respective element units when these element units are operated in parallel to each other. The current may concentrate in the part of the element unit where it is easiest for the current to flow, and this may damage the element unit. This phenomenon will be more specifically described taking as examples a gate turn off thyristor and transistors of a comb shaped emitter structure and a multi emitter structure. A gate turn off thyristor to be referred to as aGO for brevity hereinafter is a four layered s rnicon ductor device which is similar to a general thyristor in that the gate electrode is maintained at a positive potential to allow flow of a gate current and to trigger the device. The thyristor of the general type is turned off by commutating the main current by way of a commutation circuit. In contrast to this, the GTO is turned off by maintaining the gate electrode at a negative potential to allow a negative current flow.Since the ccmmutation circuit requires space and cost for the applied device and renders the overall device complex in structure, omission of the commutation circuit is considerably advantageous. When the devices characteristics are considered, the turn off time of the GTO is significantly shorter than that of the general thyristor. The GTO is, therefore, receiving more attention. The GTO has an inherent problem of current concentration during the turn off operation. The current concentration basically involves two modes. One mode occurs inside each element unit which constitutes theGTO. The other mode occurs between the element units.The former mode occurs in the initial to intermediate stages of the turn off period. In this former mode, when a gate turn off signal is applied to the gate electrode, the parts of the cathode region closer to the gate are rendered nonconductive first. Then, the current is directed to the central part of the cathode region and finally flows only through this part. The latter mode occurs in the final stage of the turn off period. Depending upon the distribution of the impurity concentration and the difference in the carrier life times, the element unit of a larger resistance turns off at an early stage while the element unit of a smaller resistance turns off later. Therefore, at the final stage of the turn off operation, the overall current concentrates in one or several element units.When the gate current becomes smaller than the minimum value which is required for the turn off operation of theGTO, the GTO can no longer turn off and will be damaged by the excessive thermal loss. Conventionally, this problem is partially solved by adopting the structure, the partial sectional view of which is shown in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 1, an n type first base layer 12 is formed to be contiguous with a p type first emitter layer 10 to form a p n junction therewith. A p type second base layer 14 is formed to be contiguous with the n type first base layer 12 to form another p n junction therewith. A plurality of divided n type second emitter layers 16 161, 162,..., 16n are formed on the surface of the second base layer 14. An anode electrode 18, a gate electrode 20, and cathode electrodes 22 221, 222,..., 22n are formed on the surface of the structure as shown in Fig. 1.The second emitter layers 16 are obtained by dividing the original layer into a plurality of layers by mesa etching. The second emitter layers 16 are divided in order to decrease the voltage drop, which is determined by the product of the base current flowing through the second base layer 14 during the turn off operation and the lateral resistance RB, and in order to increase the gate current flow at a given gate voltage. If the gate current can be increased, the anode current which can be controlled by the gate may be increased. In other words, the current concentration in the divided individual element unit may be reduced to the minimum if the lateral resistanceRB is decreased. In order to decrease the lateral resistance RB, the second emitter layers are thus divided.Alternatively, it is also possible to increase the impurity concentration of the second base layer 14 to thereby reduce the sheet resistance of this layer 14. It is also possible to further divide the second emitter layers 16 to thereby reduce the distance between the emitter and the gate. Conventionally, one of these measures is taken to alleviate the current concentration in the individual element units to increase the maximum controllable anode current. However, these measures have limitations and cannot prevent the concentration of the overall current in one or several element units at the final stage of the turn off operation.This indicates that these measures cannot prevent the current concentration between the element units. A case will now be described with reference to a transistor of a comb shaped emitter structure or a multi emitter structure. In a transistor of a comb shaped emitter structure or a multi emitter structure with a plurality of divided emitters, currents of different values flow through the individual element units. This is partially attributable to the nonuniformities in the impurity concentration distribution and the minority carrier life time distribution or to the crystal defects which are randomly located in the semiconductor device. This is also attributable to the fact that the emitters and the base interleave with each other so that the resistances of the electrode wirings connecting the electrode lead wires and the respective element units differ from one element unit to another.In an element unit which easily allows the flow of current, the temperature rises higher than the temperature of the other element units according to the power consumption, which is expressed by the product of the collector voltage and the collector current. As the temperature rises, the base emitter voltage of the element unit decreases, so that the current increases. This positive feedback is repeated, until the temperature exceeds the critical temperature for maintainting the p n junction, and the transistor loses its function. Conventionally, this problem is partially solved by adopting the structure, the partial sectional view of which is shown in Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 2, a collector layer 24 comprises an n type layer 241 of high impurity concentration and an n type layer 242 of low impurity concentration. A p type base layer 26 is formed thereover to form a p n junction therewith. A plurality of n type divided emitter layers 28 281, 2827..., 28n are formed thereover, forming p n junctions. A collector electrode 30, a base electrode 32 and emitter electrodes 34 341 342 34n are formed as shown in Fig 2. Resistors 36 361, 36 36n of, for example, polycrystalline silicon thin films are series connected with the respective emitter electrodes 34.The resistance of the resistors 36 is set to be the same as or more than the resistance between the collector electrode 30 and the emitter electrodes 34. By the incorporation of these resistors 36, variations in the element units inside the semiconductor device are reduced to make the current distribution more uniform. This emitter ballast resistor method as adopted in the above case does not decrease the emitter area and is high in efficiency. However, this method presents a problem in the manufacturing process, especially, in the control of the resistance. For example, in order to form a thin film resistor of 5,000 A thick on a rectangular electrode of 100 micrometers pm x 500 micrometers pom , the sheet resistance of the thin film becomes 106 Q h if the resistance is set to 5 ohms Q . It is extremely difficult to control such high sheet resistance with good repeatability, so that the yield rate of the transistor with the same emittercollector saturation voltage becomes small.Even if this problem is overcome, the current concentration cannot be completely avoided, especially since this method is incapable of preventing the concentration of the current flowing in the lateral direction of the base layer 26. It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device which improves the current balance between respective element units. Another object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device which prevents excessive current concentration in a particular element unit. Still another object of this invention is to provide a semiconductor device which is improved in reliability. The object has been achieved by the semiconductor device which comprises a base layer of a first conductivity type formed on a semiconductor substrate of at least one layer a plurality of emitter layers of a second conductivity type formed on a surface of the base layer, the emitter layers, the base layer and the semiconductor substrate defining a plurality of element units and a current suppressing layer formed in the region of the base layer between each pair of adjacent emitter layers so as to suppress the current flowing between each pair of the adjacent element units in a lateral direction. According to the present invention, a current supressing layer for supressing the base current flowing between the element units in the lateral direction is formed in the base layer region between each pair of emitter layers. Therefore, the current concentration in a particular element unit may be effectively prevented. By way of example and to make the description clearer, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a partial sectional view of a conventional gate turn off thyristor Fig. 2 is a partial sectional view of a conventional transistor Fig. 3 is a partial sectional view of a gate turnoff thyristor according to a first embodiment of the present invention Fig. 4 is a partial sectional view of a modification of the first embodiment of Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a partial sectional view of another modification of the first embodiment of Fig. 3 Fig. 6 is a partial sectional view of a transistor according to a second embodiment of the present invention Fig. 7 is a partial sectional view of a modification of the second embodiment of Fig. 6 and Fig. 8 is a partial sectional view of another modification of the second embodiment. Fig. 3 is a partial sectional view of a gate turnoff thyristor to be referred to as a GTO for brevity hereinafter according to the first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 3, a p type first emitter layer 40, an n type first base layer 42 and a p type second base layer 44 are sequentially formed in the order named. On the surface of the second base layer 44 a plurality of divided, mesa n type second emitter layers 46 461, 462,..., 46n are formed to define a plurality of element units. An anode electrode 48, a gate electrode 50 and cathode electrodes 52 521, 5227..., 52n are formed in ohmic contact with the first emitter layer 40, the second base layer 44, and the second emitter layer 46.In the regions of the second base layer 44 which are between the second emitter layers 46, n type layers 54 541 542 54n are formed as current suppressing layers for suppressing the lateral base current. Each n type layer 54 is at substantially an equal distance from the adjacent second emitter layers 46. The depth of each n type layer 54 is set so that the n type layer 54 does not reach the first base layer 42. An insulation film 56 of, for example, SiO2 or Si3N4 may be formed on the surface of each n type layer 54 to improve noise capability, however, its use is optional. The effects of this embodiment will now be described.The GTO of this embodiment is characterized in that the n type layer 54, formed inside the p type second base layer 44, cuts off the lateral base current which flows through the second base element 44 during the turn off operation. According to the experiments conducted, in a conventional GTO having an average impurity concentration of 4 x 1017 cm 3 in the second base layer, the lateral resistance RB gradually increases as the turn off operation progresses if the lateral resistance of the second base layer in the initial stage of the turn off operation is 0.05 Q. In the final stage of the turn off operation, the lateral resistance RB becomes 0.3 . This indicates that the excess carriers which are stored in the second base layer are gradually excluded through the gate electrode.The anode cathode resistance RAC is about 1 Q under the conductive condition. This anodecathode resistance RAC abruptly increases to about 10 times its original value during the turn off operation.During the turn off operation, the lateral resistance AB is negligible compared to the anode cathode resistanceRAC. Therefore, if the anode cathode resistanceRAC differs from one element unit to another, the current flows from an element unit with greater RAC to an element unit with smaller RAC through the second base layer 44. The anode cathode resistance RAC is determined by the impurity concentration distribution and the minority carrier life time of the base or the like. In practice, it is almost impossible to make these characteristics uniform from one element unit to another.Therefore, this phenomenon occurs with the conventionalGTO almost without failure. In contrast to this, in theGTO of the structure according to the first embodiment of the present invention, since the n type layer 54 is formed immediately below the gate electrode 50, the lateral resistance of the second base layer 44 is increased accordingly. Then, it becomes difficult for the current to flow in the lateral direction of the second base layer 44. Specifically, with reference toFig. 3, the second emitter layer 46 has a surface impurity concentration of 4 x 1020 cm 3. The second base layer 44 and the first emitter layer 40 have a surface impurity concentration of 2 x 1018 cm 3. The first base layer 42 has an average impurity concentration of 8 x 1013 cm The depth of the second emitter layer 46 from the surface is 10 pm, and that of the second base layer 44 is 60 pm. Then, the sheet resistance of the second base layer 44 is 31 Q D. The n type layers 54 are formed to depths of 30, 40 and 50 pm in the second base layer 44. The sheet resistances of the second base layers 44 into which the n type layers 54 extend become 265, 1,904 and 4,044 Q , respectively.Thus, the resistance of that part of the second base layer 44 corresponding to the n type layer 54 which is 50 pm deep from the surface becomes about 130 times that of that part of the second base layer 44 which is immediately below the cathode electrode 52. During the turn off period, the second base layer 44 is still a high impurity concentration layer. Therefore, the resistance may be discussed only in terms of the sheet resistance. However, according to this embodiment, the resistance between each pair of element units is about 40 ohms. This value is about the same or slightly greater than the anode cathode resistance RAC during the turn off period, so that substantially no current flows between the element units through the second base layer 44. In other words, the current may not concentrate in a particular element unit during the turn off period.In practice, with a GTO of this embodiment, it is possible to provide an anode current flow which allows gate control and which is about five times greater than that obtainable with the GTO of the conventional structure. Furthermore, since the parts of the second base layer 44 below the cathode electrode and the cathode region are the same as those of the GTO of the conventional structure, other characteristics remain the same.The advantageous effects of the present invention may be more pronounced if a ballast resistor of a resistor film or a polycrystalline silicon film is connected to the cathode electrode 52, that is, to the semiconductor substrate. This is attributable to the fact that variations in the element units of the semiconductor substrate are improved by the ballast resistance, and the current concentration may hardly occur due to the current cut off region inside the second base layer 44. The GTO of this embodiment may be manufactured by the procedure to be described below. A semiconductor wafer for the substrate has a specific resistivity of 10 to 300 R cm, and has a thickness of 0.2 to 1.2 mm, and contains an n type impurity such as phosphorus P .Although the specific resistivity and thickness of the semiconductor wafer may be selected within the relatively wider ranges as given above, they must be appropriately selected according to the off state voltage rating of the GTO. The off state voltage rating obtainable with the impurity concentration and the width, in the ranges as given above, is within the range of 300 to 6,000 V. A p type impurity such as gallium Ga or boron B is doped from both major surfaces of the semiconductor wafer to form a first base layer 42 and to form a first emitter layer 40 and a second base layer 44 having a surface impurity concentration of 1017 to 1019 cm 3 and a thickness of 30 to 80 pm. A threelayered pnp structure is thus obtained.After depositing a masking material such as SiO2 on the major surface, part of the gate is removed by photolithography or etching to form a contact hole. An n type impurity such as POc 3 or PH3 is diffused through this contact hole into the second base layer 44 to form an n type layer therein. After depositing the masking material such asSiO2 or the like again, an n type impurity is diffused in the cathode region in a similar manner to form a second emitter layer 46. The etching depth of the gate part and the diffusion depth of the n type layer to be formed therein are determined by the depth of the original base diffusion layer. However, the deeper the n type layer is formed, the better the results obtained. However, if the n type layer reaches the p n junction formed by two bases, acceptable off state voltage rating may not be obtained.Therefore, the n type layer must be formed to be shallower than the p n junction. The subsequent steps are obvious to the skilled in the art, and the description thereof will therefore be omitted. The cathode gate junction may be of the planar type as well as of the mesa type. In the case of the planar type cathode gate junction, the step for etching the gate part may be omitted. If the p n junction formed by two bases is relatively shallow, the second emitter layer 46 and the.ll type layer as the current suppressing layer may be formed simultaneously. In this case, the number of manufacturing steps will be less than in the conventional case, resulting in high manufacturing efficiency. In addition to the embodiment described above, the present invention may include several modifications.For example, the current suppressing layer in the second base layer 44 may be formed of p type layers 58 581, 5827..., 58n of the same p conductivity type as the second base layer 44 and which have a low impurity concentration, hence, a high resistance, as shown inFig. 4. Alternatively, insulation films 60 601, 602,. 60n may be formed as shown in Fig. 5. The p type layers 58 of Fig. 4 may be easily formed by ion implantation of an n type impurity to compensate for the p type impurity in the base layer. Similar effects may be obtained with these modifications as in the former embodiment. Unlike the embodiment of Fig. 3, the p type layers 58 shown in Fig. 4 or the insulation layers 60 shown in Fig. 5 may be formed to reach the first base layer 42.Furthermore, the present invention also contemplates the formation of grooves in place of the current suppressing layers. According to the first embodiment of the present invention, in a GTO with a plurality of element units, the current concentration in a particular element unit during the turn off operation is prevented, and the switching operation may be performed with high reliability. Fig. 6 shows a partial sectional view of a transistor according to the second embodiment of the present invention. A p type base layer 72 is formed on a collector layer 70 consisting of an n type layer 701 of high impurity concentration and an n type layer 702 of low impurity concentration is to form a p n junction therebetween. A plurality of divided n type emitter layers 74 741 742 74n are formed thereover to form p n junctions therebetween, thus defining a plurality of element units. The emitter layers 74 may be completely separated from one another or may be partially coupled to one another.A collector electrode 76, a base electrode 78 and emitter electrodes 80 801, 8027..., 80n are formed in ohmic contact with the collector layer 70, the base layer 72, and the emitter layers 74. The base layer 72 has n type layers 82 821, 822,..., 82n as current suppressing layers for suppressing the lateral base current in the regions of the base layer 72 which are between the emitter layers 74. Each n type layer 82 is at an equal distance from the peripheries of the adjacent emitter layers 74.The n type layer is deeper than the emitter layer 74 and does not reach the collector layer 70. Insulation films 84 of, for example, SiQ2 or Si3N4 are formed on the surfaces of the n type layers 82. Since these insulation films 84 have very little affect on the operation of the present invention, they are optional. However, they are preferably formed to provide improved noise capability. In this embodiment, the base electrodes 78 extend over the n type layers 82 and the base layer 72. However, since these parts over the n type layers 82 do not have direct influence on the effects of the present invention, the electrodes may be omitted. The effects of the second embodiment of the present invention will now be described. A transistor of the second embodiment is characterized in that the n type layers 82 of opposite conductivity type from the base layer are formed in the base layer 72 of one conductivity type so that the base current flowing in the lateral direction between the respective element units may be suppressed when the transistor is operated with a forward or reverse high voltage and high current. In the high voltage and high current operation, the base resistanceRB is negligible compared to the collector emitter resistance RCE. Therefore, if the collector emitter resistance RCE differs from one element unit to another, some current components flow from the element unit of greater RCE to the element unit of smaller RCE through the base layer.Although the collector emitter resistanceRCE is determined by the impurity concentration and the minority carrier life time of the base, it is almost impossible to make these characteristics uniform among the element units. Therefore, this phenomenon may be considered to occur without failure with transistors of the conventional structure. On the contrary, with a transistor of the structure according to the second embodiment of the present invention, immediately below the base electrode is formed a layer of the opposite conductivity type. Therefore, the base lateral resistance increases at this part and inhibits the current flowing in the lateral direction of the base. More specifically, the emitter surface impurity 20 3 concentration of a power transistor is 1 x 10 cm The base surface impurity concentration adjacent to the n type layer is 1 x 1017 cm 3. The collector average 3 impurity concentration is 3 x 1014 cm 3. The depth of the emitter layer 74 from the surface is 5 pm, and that of the base layer 72 is 15 pm. If the layer 82 of opposite conductivity type extends to a depth of 13 pm in the base layer 72 having a sheet resistance of 1,100 Q D, the base sheet resistance at this part becomes 1.4 x 105 L1. Then, the resistance of the base layer 72 adjacent the n type layer becomes about 100 times that of the region of the base layer 72 immediately below the emitter layer 74.Since the base layer 72 is still a high impurity concentration layer under the high current operating condition, the resistance may not be discussed only in terms of the sheet resistance. However, since the resistance becomes sufficiently large as compared with the collectoremitter resistance RCE, the current does not flow between the element units through the base layer 72.Accordingly, substantial current concentration does not occur. Furthermore, since the parts of the base layer 72 immediately below the emitter layer 74 and near the emitter layer 74 remain the same as those of the conventional transistor, other characteristics are not impaired. If a ballast resistor as shown in Fig. 2 is connected to the emitter electrode 80, the ballastemitter effects enhance the lateral direction currrent suppression effects of the base layer 72, so that the current concentration suppression is achieved with even better reliability.According to the experiments conducted, when the power limits were examined with chips of 4.5 x 4.5 mm dimensions, the power limit for a transistor of conventional planar structure without a ballast resistor was 70 W, the power limit for a transistor of the ballast structure as shown in Fig. 2 was 120 W, and the power limit for a transistor of the structure of the embodiment shown in Fig. 6 was 150 W. The transistor of the second embodiment may be manufactured according to the procedure to be described below. Since the formation of the collector and the base is known to those skilled in the art, the description thereof will be omitted. After depositing a masking material such as SiO2 on the surface of the semiconductor wafer with the base, part of the base is selectively removed by photolithography or etching to form a contact hole. An n type impurity such as POUR3 or PH3 is diffused through this contact hole to form n type layers as the current suppressing layers. After depositing a masking material such as sio2 thereover again, n type emitter layers are formed in a similar manner.If it is assumed that the base collector junction is at a depth of 15 pm from the surface of the base, the n type layers as the current suppressing layers must have a depth of less than 15 pm. If the n type layers have a depth greater than 15 pm, the base collector off state voltage rating is significantly decreased. For example, if the base surface impurity concentration adjacent the n type layer is 1 x 1or7 cm 3 and the average impurity concentration of the collector layer is 3 x 1014 cm 3, the base collector off state voltage rating is about 400 V.When a voltage of 400 V is applied, the depletion layer extends about 40 pm into the collector region and about 2 pm into the base region. In this case, the depth of the n type layers as the current suppressing layers must be set to be 13 pm or less in contrast with a depth 15 pm of the base collector junction. Insulation films of, for example, SiO2 orSi3N4 are selectively formed on the surfaces of these n type layers by photolithography or etching. These insulation films may not be formed depending upon the driving conditions of the transistor. The subsequent steps are well known to those skilled in the art, and the description thereof will therefore be omitted. The emitter base junction may be of the mesa as well as of the planar type. If the emitter base junction is of the mesa type, after the base part is etched, the n type layers as the current supressing layers are formed. The second embodiments of the present invention includes several modifications. For example, as shown in Fig. 7, p type layers 86 861, 862,..., 86n of the same conductivity type as that of the base layer 72 and of low impurity concentration may be formed in the base layer 72. If that part of the base layer 72 adjacent to the p type layer 86 has a resistance about ten times that of the other parts of the base layer, the current concentration may be satisfactorily prevented. These p type layers 86 may be easily formed by. implanting an impurity such as phosphorus or arsenic at a dose of 1013 to 1015 cm 3 and to compensate for the p type impurity. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 8, insulation layers 88 881, 882,..., 88n may be formed as the current suppressing layers. In summary, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, in a transistor of a plurality of element units obtained by division of the emitters, the current concentration in a particular element unit under the high current operating condition may be effectively prevented to achieve a transistor operation of high reliability. The present invention is by no means limited to the particular embodiments described above, and various changes and modifications may be made within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
