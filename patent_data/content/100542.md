# Weft picking device of air jet weaving loom.

## Abstract
An air guide member has therein an air guide opening 38 and a slit 40 through which the weft thread W passes out of the opening. The opening has an inwardly projected land portion 42 with first and second peripheral sides b, c and includes an air induction section 38a directly connected to the slit and a weft guiding section 38b connected through the air induction section to the slit. The first peripheral side bounds partially the air induction section, while, the second peripheral side bounds partially the weft guiding section. An auxiliary nozzle 14 is associated with one of the air guide members and has an air jet opening 44 exposed to the air induction section so that air jet from the opening advances toward the weft guiding section after passing through the air induction section. The opening is inclined toward the weft picking direction by a given angle with respect to the direction. An imaginary plane P containing the second peripheral side c of the land portion 42 intersects the perimeter f of the weft guiding section at a position away from the slit 40 .
