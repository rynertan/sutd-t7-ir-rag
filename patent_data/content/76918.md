# Amorphous magnetic core and process for manufacturing to improve efficiency.

## Abstract
A magnetic core 10 with reduced losses is provided along with a related improvement in the process for fabri cating magnetic cores for electromagnetic devices from strips 16 of amorphous magnetic alloys. Magnetic powder, or magnetic powder mixed with a suitable carrier, is applied to the core for filling gaps 18 occurring between the layers 14 of the amorphous strips 16 .
