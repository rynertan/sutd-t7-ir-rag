## Description
This invention relates to a method for detecting or quantitatively analyzing a component in a sample in accordance with an immunoreaction, particularly the antigen antibody reaction as well as the reaction with marker labelled substance are carried out in a capillary tube. Conventional immunoassay techniques employ antigens labelled with radioactive substance, enzyme, fluorogenic substances or the like, or antibodies labelled with radioactive substances, enzyme, fluorogenic substances or the like. The labelled substances were then subjected to immuno reactions with antibodies or antigens in a sample respectively. The immuno reacted labelled substances were then detected or quantitated by detecting or quantitating their labels, i.e. radioisotopes, enzymes, fluorescent substances or the like. It is necessary for these conventional immunoassay techniques to separate the reacted labelled or unlabelled substances and their corresponding unreacted labelled or unlabelled substances from each other, in order to define quality or quantity of the sought antigen or antibody. Thus, these conventional techniques were accompanied by such drawbacks that they require cumbersome operations, professional skill and time consuming steps for the above mentioned separation. US A 4361537 discloses a test device for determining substances in fluid samples where the device comprises a strip element which is composed of a material capable of transporting a developing fluid. A labelling agent and a coupling agent for the labelling agent are provided on the strip element and a solution of the sample is deposited on the strip element at a position other than both ends thereof. One end of the strip element is immersed in a developing liquid to develop the sample by capillary action so as to react the sample, labelling agent and coupling agent on the strip element. EP A 46004 discloses a concentrating zone method in heterogeneous immunoassays employing a device comprising an immunosorbing zone to which a member of an immunological pair mip is fixed against diffusive movement. EP A 21214 discloses a multilayer column chromatography specific binding assay method which makes use of specific types of capillarily absorbent beds to obtain a chromatographic column type separation of a reaction mixture obtained by reacting a target antigen and its corresponding labelled antibody in advance. The present inventors have hence carried out an extensive research with a view toward solving drawbacks of the conventional techniques. As a result, it has been found that a component present in a sample may readily be detected or even quantitatively analyzed in a short period time by causing the marker labelled substance with or without immunoreaction with the component in a sample to move from one zone and then uptaking and immobilizing them selectively at different zones in the capillary tube while making use of capillarity as well as using an immobilizing and uptaking substance for the labelled substance. Based on the above finding, the present invention has been brought to completion. Accordingly, this invention provides an immunoassay for detecting or quantitatively measuring a component of a sample by an immunoreaction, characterized in that a solid matrix bearing, in a state immobilized thereon, a substance adapted to take up a labelling substance and another solid matrix holding at least a labelled immunoreactive reagent thereon are packed in a capillary tube the sample is allowed to migrate in the capillary tube while making use of capillarity so as to subject the sample to the immunoreaction within the capillary tube the target substance labelled immunoreactive reagent reaction product or the remaining, unreacted, labelled immunoreactive reagent is combined with the substance adapted to take up a labelling substance so as to immobilize the same and the thus immobilized labelled substance is then measured.

Histo. Chem. Cytochem. Any substance may be employed as the uptaking substance so long as the substance will combine or capture below described immuno reacted labelled substances or non immuno reacted labelled substances. Examples of such substance are if the target substance is antigen, then antibody against the antigen, if the target substance is antibody, then antigen which reacts with the antibody, and substances which have affinity toward the label. In order to immobilize the capturing substance on solid matrix, either inherent adsorbancy of the uptaking substance to the solid matrix or some well established method for such purpose will be employed. Examples of such uptaking substances are glass beads which have been treated to adsorb basic amino acids or the like, or glass beads on which cross linking agent is coupled. Glutaraldehyde, maleimide or the like may be used as the cross linking agent. So treated beads are then complexed with the uptaking substance for the labelled substances. Where cellulose or the like is used as matrix, the cellulose or the like is treated with an oxidizing agent such as ferrous perchromate, potassium periodate or sodium periodate causing the surface of cellulose to form aldehyde derivatives which then will form the Schiff base with amino groups of the uptaking substance resulting the immobilization of the uptaking substance to the matrix. As one embodiment of this invention, it may be mentioned that a capillary tube is packed with labelled substance and insoluble matrix which is coupled with the uptaking substance which will immobilize the labelled substance. The tip of so manufactured capillary tube is then contacted with a sample liquid which contain target substance, thus causing the liquid to migrate upward through the inside of the capillary tube by the capillary action. As the liquid migrate upward in the capillary tube, when the target substance is similar to the labelled substance, the target substance and the labelled substance together will continue to migrate upward inside the capillary tube until the liquid encounter the uptaking substance which is immobilized on the solid matrix. At the time of the encounter, the target substance and the labelled substance will be captured by the uptaking substance on the solid matrix in an amount proportional to the concentrations of the target substance and the labelled substance. The amount of the labelled substance captured by the uptaking substance will reflect the concentration of the target substance in the sample liquid. As another embodiment of this invention, it may also be mentioned that a capillary tube is packed with labelled substance which reacts with the target substance and with the insoluble matrix on which the uptaking substance which will immobilize the target substance is complexed. The tip of a so manufactured capillary tube is then contacted with a sample liquid which contain target substance, thus causing the liquid to migrate upward through the inside of the capillary tube by the capillary action. As the liquid migrates upwards in the capillary tube, when the target substance is reactive with the labelled substance, the target substance will form complex and the complex as well as unreacted target substance, unreacted labelled substance and other unreactive substances contained in the sample liquid continue to migrate upwards together inside of the capillary tube until the liquid encounter the uptaking substance for the target substance which was immobilized on the solid matrix. At the time of the encounter, the unreacted target substance and the labelled substance which is in the complex with the target substance will be captured by the capturing agent on the solid matrix in an amount proportional to the concentrations of the unreacted target substance and the labelled substance which is in complex with the target substance in the liquid at the point of the encounter with the capturing agent. The amount of the labelled substance captured by the uptaking substance will reflect the concentration of the target substance in the sample liquid. For the above method, it is necessary as needed to provide other than those mentioned above, solids particulate matrix to fill void spaces, substrate, chromogenic agent, inhibitor and the like. As the substrate and chromogenic agent, the following combinations substrate chromogenic agent may be employed for their respective enzymes as label In the present method, there are packed in a capillary tube a solid matrix with an uptaking substance immobilized thereon for its corresponding labelled substance and a solid matrix holding a labelled immunoreactive reagent thereon, and if necessary, a solid matrix bearing a substrate, chromogenic agent, inhibitor and the like, all of which matrix have been prepared in the above described manner. The capillary tube may be made of glass, or either transparent or translucent synthetic resin, for example, polyethylene, polycarbonate, polypropylene, polystyrene, acrylic phthalate resin or the like. The diameter of each capillary tube may preferably be 0.5 2 mm or notably 1.0 1.1 mm, while its length may preferably be 3 20 cm or particularly 5 15 cm. It is important that the inner wall of the capillary tube does not adsorb any protein thereon. It is thus preferred to treat beforehand the inner wall of the capillary tube for example with a neutral buffer solution of a protein for instance, albumin or the like . In order to pack the capillary tube with the solid matrix bearing the uptaking substance immobilized thereon for the labelled substance as well as with the reagent holding solid matrix, it is necessary to close up the lower end of the capillary tube with a plug of cotton, polyester or the like, and then to establish a negative pressure within the capillary tube by means of a suction device such as aspirator, whereby sucking and packing the solid matrix in the capillary tube. It is required to pack the capillary tube with at least the solid matrix bearing the uptaking substance immobilized thereon for the labelled substance and the solid matrix holding the labelled immunoreactive reagent thereon. If necessary, the capillary tube may additionally be packed with the solid matrix holding the substrate, chromogenic agent, inhibitor and the like adhered thereon. It is necessary to pack the solid matrix with the uptaking substance immobilized thereon for the labelled substance in such a way that the sample reaches the solid matrix after the sample has been subjected to its immunoreaction. This may be achieved by packing the capillary tube with matrix bearing an uptaking substance which is capable of combining with either the immuno reaction product with the labelled reagent or the unreacted labelled reagent so as to immobilize the labelled substance in either as the reaction product or as the unreacted immuno reactive reagent. Alternatively one can pack a capillary tube with one matrix beading an uptaking substance which immobilizes either the immuno reaction product with labelled reagent or the unreacted labelled reagent and another matrix bearing an uptaking substance which immobilizes both the immuno reaction product with labelled reagent and the unreacted labelled reagent separately at the different location in such so that the sample reaches the former first and the latter later so as to separate the immuno reaction product with labelled reagent from that of the unreacted labelled reagent. It is also sometimes necessary to pack the solid matrix bearing the uptaking substance immobilized thereon for the labelled substance and the solid matrix holding thereon the labelled immunoreactive reagent, substrate, chromogenic agent, inhibitor and the like in such a way that they are isolated from each other. To ensure this isolation, a solid matrix may be used. In the present invention, the following basic packing orders may be followed to pack an inert matrix bearing an uptaking substance immobilized thereon for a labelled substance and another inert matrix holding thereon a labelled and immuno reactive reagent where the target component in a sample is an antigen. Besides, these capillary tubes a h may be combined suitably. In order to detect or quantitatively analyze a target component in a sample by using the thus prepared measuring capillary tube, it is necessary to dip the lower end of the measuring capillary tube in a solution of the sample so as to cause the solution to be withdrawn into the capillary tube by the capillary action. Here, if the target component in the sample is an antigen, reactions such as those to be given next will take place to immobilize the labelled substance. The antigen in the sample reacts first with the labelled antibody to form the antigen labelled antibody. This antigen labelled antibody and the remaining, unreacted labelled antibody are then caused to move up the capillary. Upon contact with the immobilized antigen, the unreacted labelled antibody reacts with the immobilized antigen, resulting in the formation of the labelled antibody immobilized antigen to achieve immobilization. The antigen in the sample is brought, along with the labelled antigen, into contact with the immobilized antibody. Both of the antigens react competitively, resulting in the immobilization of the labelled antigen as the labelled antigen immobilized antibody. The antigen in the sample reacts with the labelled antibody to form the antigen labelled antibody. Then, the antigen labelled antibody and the remaining, unreacted labelled antibody are caused to move, thereby contacting with the immobilized antibody. Thus, the antigen labelled antibody reacts with the immobilized antibody, resulting in its immobilization as the immobilized antibody antigen labelled antibody. The antigen in the sample is caused to react with the labelled antibody and form the antigen labelled antibody, which is then brought into contact with the immobilized antibody first to immobilize as the immobilized antibody antigen labelled antibody. Also, if the antigen in the sample is present in an amount greater than the labelled antibody, the excess antigen reacts, in competition with the labelled antigen, with the immobilized antibody second so that it is immobilized as the labelled antigen immobilized antibody. The antigen in the sample reacts with the labelled antibody to form the antigen labelled antibody, which in turn reacts with the immobilized antibody so that the antigen labelled antibody is immobilized as the immobilized antibody antigen labelled antibody. On the other hand, any unreacted portion of the labelled antibody is caused to move further, thereby reacting with the immobilized antigen so that the unreacted fraction of the labelled antibody is immobilized as the immobilized antigen labelled antibody. The antigen in the sample reacts with the labelled antibody to form the antigen labelled antibody, which is then brought into contact with the immobilized antibody and immobilize the antigen labelled antibody as the immobilized antibody antigen labelled antibody. On the other hand, any unreacted fraction of the labelled antibody and those antigen labelled antibody which was not immobilized by the immobilized antibody are then caused to move further so that they react with the immobilized anti label antibody to immobilize as the immobilized anti label antibody labelled antibody and the immobilized anti label antibody labelled antibody antigen. The antigen in the sample reacts with the labelled antibody and form the antigen labelled antibody, which is thereafter brought into contact with the immobilized antibody the auxiliary labelled substance , thereby immobilized as the immobilized antibody the auxiliary labelled substance antigen labelled antibody. Furthermore, any unreacted fraction of the labelled antibody is caused to move further so that it is reacted with the immobilized anti label antibody the auxiliary labelled substance , thereby resulting in its immobilization as the immobilized anti label antibody auxiliary label substance labelled antibody. This method can detect the label only when the labelled antibody is juxtapositioned to the auxiliary substance. The term auxiliary labelled substance as used herein means, for example, glucose oxidase which produce the substrate for peroxidase from glucose through an enzymatic reaction, NADH as co enzyme for diaphorase, a substance which is necessary for luminescent substances to excite , or the like. When a sample consisting of a mixture of the labelled substance the labelled target substance and the sample is soaked in, the target substance and labelled substance react, in a competitive fashion, with the immobilized antibody for their immobilization. The amount of the labelled substance is then measured. This immobilized amount decreases as the concentration of the target substance increases. A liquid, for example, a phosphate buffered physiological saline hereinafter abbreviated as PBS is then sucked into the capillary tube. The liquid is allowed to move through the capillary tube while washing the unreacted labelled substance and sample liquid away. As a result, the immobilized labelled substance and target substance are allowed to remain in the capillary tube. When a mixture of a labelled substance an antibody having affinity to a target substance, which has been labelled and a sample is soaked in the capillary tube a , a combined product of the target substance and labelled substance reacts with the immobilized antibody so as to immobilize the combined product. The amount of the thus immobilized labelled substance increases as the concentration of the target substance increases. Then, another liquid is also soaked into the capillary tube. This second liquid passes through the capillary tube while washing any extra portion of the labelled substance and the liquid sample away. As a result, the thus immobilized target substance is allowed to remain in the capillary tube. In this invention, the thus immobilized labelled substance may be measured. Where the label is a radioisotope, the amount may be determined by means of a gamma counter while holding the lower end thereof down. Alternatively, the portion of the capillary tube which contains the immobilized radio labelled substance may be cut off for measurement. In case of the radiation cannot be measured by such a gamma counter, it is preferred to measure it by a scintillation counter. Where the labelling agent is an enzyme or fluorescent substance, the labelling agent is caused to produce a color by a substrate or color producing agent filled in the capillary tube or by light of an exciting wavelength respectively. Thus, the amount of the labelled substance can be measured. Alternatively, the substrate and color producing agent may be sucked after the liquid sample has been sucked in when the label is enzymes. In the method of this invention, body fluids such as blood, serum, plasma, lymph, salivary juice and urine as well as effluent may be employed as liquid samples to be assayed. Even if a liquid sample contains one or more components inhibitory to the intended immunoreaction, its measurement may still be feasible provided that such components are in advance either inactivated, removed or diluted to such a low concentration as to avoid any deleterious effect to the measurement. The invention will hereinafter be described by the following Examples. Five marks were respectively placed, first one at a point 5 mm from the lower end of the albumin coated glass capillary tubes and then successive four marks upward on the capillary tube with an interval of 3.5 mm. Polyester fibers a 1 were packed over the first 5 mm. The lower end was then connected to a vacuum pump to produce a negative pressure within the capillary tube so that the dianisidine mixed GB.BSA a 2 was sucked to fill up the next 3.5 mm. In the same manner, the GB.BSA a 3 , αRb IgG HRP mixed GB.BSA a 4 , GB.BSA a 5 and Rb IgG O a 6 were packed successively. The GB a 7 was then packed through the remaining space of the capillary tube to a point 5 mm the way down from the upper end. Finally, polyester fibers were packed in the remaining 5 mm. Figure 1 3 1 Distinction between human serum and rabbit serum The procedures of 3 1 were followed except that PBS containing 0.03 of hydrogen peroxide was used as a substrate solution. As a result, the zone corresponding to the Rb IgG O was colored in brown in the case of human blood, while no color was observed in the case of rabbit blood. The procedures of Example 1, 2 were followed to prepare the following capillary tubes. Polyester fibers b 1 were packed over the first 5 mm, heparin and EDTA mixed GB.BSA b 2 over the next 3.5 mm, the dianisidine mixed GB.BSA b 3 over the next 3.5 mm, and similarly, the GB.BSA b 4 , Rb IgG HRP mixed GB.BSA b 5 , GB.BSA b 6 and αRb IgG O b 7 were respectively packed 3.5 mm each. The GB b 8 was then packed in the remaining space of the capillary tube up to a point 5 mm down from the upper end of the capillary tube, and the remaining 5 mm was packed with polyester fibers. Figure 2 Two capillary tubes were provided, and rubber suction cups, each with a hole, were attached respectively to the upper ends of the capillary tubes. The lower end of one of the capillary tubes was brought into contact with a nick produced in a part of human ear, while the lower end of the other capillary tube was brought into contact with a nick produced in a part of rabbit ear. Each fresh blood was slowly sucked to the zone b 7 in Figure 2, while making use of the rubber suction cup. At this stage, the amount of the sucked blood was about 15 µ1. It took 20 seconds for the suction. Then, the lower end of each of the capillary tubes was dipped in PBS containing 0.003 of hydrogen peroxide. The PBS containing 0.003 of hydrogen peroxide was sucked, making use of the rubber suction cup, to a point near the upper end 9 10 cm up from the lower end of the capillary tube. It took 7 minutes for the suction. As a result, the zone corresponding to the anti Rb IgG b 7 in Figure 2 was colored in brown in the case of human blood but in the case of rabbit blood, the same zone was tinged lightly compared with the former. The following capillary tubes were prepared by following the procedures of Example 1, 2 . The absorbent cotton c 1 was packed over the first 5 mm, and GB.BSA c 2 , αCRP HRP mixed GB.BSA c 3 , GB.BSA c 4 and αCRP O c 5 were then packed respectively 5 mm each. The GB c 6 was packed in the remaining space of the capillary tube up to a point 5 mm the way down from the upper end of the capillary tube, and the absorbent cotton was packed in the remaining 5 mm. Four capillary tubes were provided for detection of CRP. Their lower ends were respectively dipped in I rabbit serum, II normal human serum, III patient serum, and IV serum containing 5 mg dl of CRP. The liquid samples were each soaked up to the zone c 3 in Figure 3. Here, the amount of each of the thus soaked samples was about 5 µ1. It took 30 60 seconds for the soaking. Thereafter, the lower ends of the capillary tubes were dipped in a color producing substrate solution. The color producing substrate solution was soaked up to a point 8 9 cm the way up from the lower end near the upper end of each capillary tube. It took 20 minutes for the soaking. As a result, no color was observed in the zone corresponding to the αCRP O c 5 in Figure 3 in the case of I and II , while a greenish color was observed in the same zone in the case of III and IV . From the lower end of each albumin coated glass capillary tube, the first mark was made at 5 mm and the second at 10 mm from the lower end. Then, six marks each with an interval of 3.5 mm were made. Two fibrous reagents were inserted from the lower end. Namely, the GOD O d 2 was first packed from a point 5 mm the way up from the lower end to a point 10 mm up from the same lower end, and the Glu mixed absorbent cotton d 1 was then packed from the lower end to the point 5 mm up from the lower end, both using a needle. Thereafter, while sucking from the lower end, there were packed, each over a 3.5 mm length, the dianisidine mixed GB.BSA d 3 , GB.BSA d 4 , glutathione mixed GB.BSA d 5 , αFDP HRP mixed GB.BSA d 6 , GB.BSA d 7 and αFDP O d 8 respectively. The GB d 9 was then packed in the remaining space of the capillary tube up to a point 5 mm down from the upper end of the capillary tube, and the absorbent cotton was packed over the remaining 5 mm. Figure 4 Two capillary tubes were provided for detection. One of the capillary tubes was dipped in urine containing FDP D₂ in an amount of 50 µg per milliliter of the urine, while the other capillary tube was dipped in normal human urine. Both urine samples were soaked up to points near the upper ends 8 9 cm the way up from the lower ends of their corresponding capillary tubes. Here, the amount of each of the soaked urine samples was about 25 µ1. It took 9 minutes for the soaking. As a result, the zone corresponding to the αFDP O d 8 in Fig. 4 was colored in brown in the case of the FDP added urine. No color was however observed in the case of the normal human urine. Following the procedures of Example 1, 2 , the following capillary tubes were prepared. The polyester fibers e 1 were packed over the first 5 mm, followed by packing of the dianisidine mixed GB.BSA e 2 , GB.BSA e 3 , Rb IgG HRP mixed GB.BSA e 4 , GB.BSA e 5 and Rb IgG O e 6 respectively over 3.5 mm by 3.5 mm. The GB e 7 was thereafter packed in the remaining space in the capillary tube up to a point 5 mm down from the upper end of the capillary tube, and the polyester fibers were finally packed in the remaining 5 mm. Two capillary tubes were provided for detection. The lower ends of the capillary tubes were dipped respectively in goat serum under immunization with Rb IgG I and normal goat serum II confirmed by the Ouchterlony method . The samples were soaked up to points e 3 in Figure 5. At this stage, the amount of each of the samples was about 3 µl. It took 20 seconds. Then, the lower ends of the capillary tubes were dipped in PBS which contained 0.03 of hydrogen peroxide. The PBS containing 0.03 of hydrogen peroxide was soaked up to points near the upper ends 8 9 cm the way down from the lower ends of the capillary tubes. It took 20 minutes for the soaking. As a result, the zone corresponding to the Rb IgG O e 6 in Fig. 5 was colored in brown in the case of the goat serum containing anti Rb IgG antibody I , while no color was observed in the case of the normal goat serum II . The following capillary tubes were prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, 2 . The absorbent cotton f 1 was packed over the first 5 mm, and then the GB.BSA f 2 over next 7 mm, the αHSA HRP mixed GB.BSA f 3 over 3.5 mm, the GB.BSA f 4 over 7 mm, and the αHSA O f 5 over 3.5 mm. The GB.BSA f 6 was thereafter packed in the remaining space of the capillary tube up to a point 5 mm down from the upper end of the capillary tube, and the absorbent cotton was also packed in the remaining 5 mm. After completion of the packing, a mark was placed at a point 5 cm the way up from the lower end. Figure 6 3 Determination of the presence or absence of human albumin in effluent Three testing tubes were provided for detection. The lower ends of the testing tubes were dipped respectively in PBS containing human serum in an amount of 1 ml per liter of the PBS I , Effluent 1 II and Effluent 2 III . These samples were soaked up to the zones f 5 in Figure 6. At this stage, the amount of each of the soaked samples was about 9 µ1. It took 1 minute for the soaking. Thereafter, the lower ends of the capillary tubes were dipped in a color producing substrate solution. The color producing substrate solution was soaked up to points about 5 cm up from the lower ends of the capillary tubes. It took 15 minutes for the soaking. As a result, in the case of I and II , blue color were observed respectively in the zones corresponding to the αHSA O f 5 in Figure 6 , whereas no color was observed in the case of III . From these results, it was possible to determine that Effluent 1 contained human albumin. The following capillary tubes were prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, 2 . The polyester fibers g 1 were packed over the first 5 mm, followed by packing of the dianisidine mixed GB.BSA g 2 , GB.BSA g 3 , αAFP HRP mixed GB.BSA g 4 , GB.BSA g 5 , αAFP O g 6 , GB.BSA g 7 and AFP O g 8 respectively 3.5 mm each. Then, the GB g 9 was packed in the remaining space of the capillary tube to a point 5 mm down from the upper end thereof, and the polyester fibers were again packed in the remaining 5 mm. Figure 7 Six capillary tubes were provided for measurements. The lower ends of the capillary tubes were dipped respectively in serum containing α feto protein in an amount of 0 g per milliliter of the serum I , serum containing α fetoprotein in an amount of 100 ng per milliliter of the serum II , serum containing α fetoprotein in an amount of 1 µg per milliliter of the serum III , serum containing α feto protein in an amount of 10 µg per milliliter of the serum IV , normal human serum V , and patient serum VI . These samples were soaked up to the zones g 8 in Figure 7. The amount of each of the soaked samples was about 10 µ1. It took 2 minutes for the soaking. Thereafter, the lower ends of the capillary tubes were dipped in PBS which contained 0.003 of hydrogen peroxide. The PBS containing 0.003 of hydrogen peroxide was soaked up to points near the upper ends 8 9 cm up from the lower ends of the capillary tubes. It took 25 minutes for the soaking. As a result, the sample I gave no color to the αAFP O g 6 in Figure 7 but left a dark color at the AFP O g 8 in Figure 7 . The sample II lightly tinged the αAFP O g 6 in Figure 7 and dark colored the AFP O g 8 in Figure 7 . The sample III colored not only α AFP O g 6 in Figure 7 but also the AFP O g 8 in Figure 7 . In the case of the sample IV , the αAFP O g 6 in Figure 7 was dark colored and the AFP O g 8 in Figure 7 was lightly tinged. The samples V and I gave the same results, while the samples VI and II provided the same results. From the above results, no α fetoprotein was observed in the normal human serum, whereas it was detected in the patient serum which contained α fetoprotein in an amount of about 100 ng per milliliter of the serum. The following capillary tubes were prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, 2 . The polyester fibers h 1 were packed over the first 5 mm, followed by the packing of the albumin mixed GB.BSA h 2 , dianisidine mixed GB.BSA h 3 , sodium perborate mixed GB.BSA h 4 , glutathione mixed GB.BSA h 5 , GB.BSA h 6 , αFDP HRP mixed GB.BSA h 7 , GB.BSA h 8 , αFDP O h 9 , GB.BSA h 10 and FDP O h 11 respectively 3.5 mm each.
