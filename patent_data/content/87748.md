# Hydraulic circuit system for construction machine.

## Abstract
A hydraulic circuit system of a construction machine having first and second hydraulic circuit 8, 10 , and a bypass circuit for connecting the first and second circuits together 54 . The first circuit includes a first hydraulic pump 4 and a first valve group 14 having a plurality of directional control valves for controlling a flow of hydraulic fluid from the first pump, and the second circuit 10 includes a second hydraulic pump 6 and a second valve group 20 having a plurality of directional control valves for controlling a flow of hydraulic fluid from the second pump. A plurality of actuators 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66 are driven by the hydraulic fluid supplied from the first and second pumps through the valves. The valves of the first group include a first travel directional control valve 40 for controlling the first travel actuator 64 connected in tandem with other valves in a position downstream thereof to enable the other valves to have priority in receiving a supply of hydraulic fluid from the first pump 4 . The valves of the second group include a second travel directional control valve 44 for controlling a second travel actuator 66 connected in series with other valves of the second valve group in a position upstream thereof through a directional selecting valve to directly receive a supply of hydraulic fluid from the second pump 6 to supply same to the second travel actuator and return hydraulic fluid from the second travel actuator 44 to the second circuit 10 . The bypass circuit includes a bypass line for connecting the first travel valve in series with the second travel valve in a position downstream thereof through the selecting valve 52 . The selecting valve has first and second positions and is normally in the first position to communi cate the second travel valve with the other valves of the second group to supply the hydraulic fluid from the second travel valve to the other valves. When the first travel valve and at least one of the other valves of the second group are simultaneously actuated, the selecting valve is switched to the second position to bring the second travel valve 44 into communication with the first travel valve 40 through the bypass line 54 thereby to supply the hydraulic fluid from the second travel valve 44 to the first travel valves 40 .
