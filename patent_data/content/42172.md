Antibacteriai tetronolide compounds F 1 and F 2 are produced by fermentation of a microorganism belonging to the genus Micromonospora. The antibiotics F 1 and F 2 are accumulated in the culture liquor and are iso lated therefrom, respectively. The acyl derivatives of F 1 and F 2, that is F 1 21 0 acetate, F 1 21 0 propionate, F 1 21 0 n butylate, F 1 diacetate, F 1 dipropionate, F 2 triacetate, F 2 tripropionate and F 2 tri n butylate, etc., are chemically synthesized from F 1 and F 2, respec tively. Their formula
