# Apparatus for deaerating condensate in a condenser.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for deaerating condensate in a condenser 1 employed in a steam turbine plant, an open conduit 50a to permit the condensate to flow to a covered conduit 50b covered so that the condensate cannot flow therein without passing the open conduit 50a . The conden sate is heated in the open conduit 50a , resulting in more effective and quick deaeration of the condensate and quick start up of the plant.
