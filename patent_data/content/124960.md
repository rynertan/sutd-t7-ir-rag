# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES COMPRISING SILICIDES

## Abstract
Polysilicon elements of integrated circuits, for example gates 24 or interconnects, are provided with metallic silicide layers 26 in order to take advantage of the lower resistivity thereof. The polysilicon elements are defined on an oxide layer 23 disposed on a silicon substrate 20 before polysili con metallisation. After polysilicon metallisation the metal and polysilicon are caused to interdiffuse to form silicide layers 26 covering the polysilicon elements 24 .
