## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to amorphous thermoplastic polymers containing sulfone groups. Polyarylene polyethers are describ ed in, for example, U.S. Patent 4,175,175. This patent describes a polymer which has the following structure EMI1.1 This polymer is commercially available and is a tough, rigid, high strength thermoplastic which maintains its properties over a wide temperature range from 150 F to above 3000 F. Polymer A has a good combination of mechanical properties and excellent electrical properties.Said polymer is highly resistant to mineral acids, alkali and salt solutions but will be attacked by environments such as polar organic solvents. Thus, there is a need to improve the environmental resistance, particularly the environmental stress crack resistance of Polymer A so that it can be used in applications where it will be exposed to a solvent environment. Attempts have been made to develop polymers which have the good properties of polymer A and additionally, improved environmental stress crack resistance. The following polymer B 1EMI2.1 has a good balance of mechanical properties, and possesses higher notched impact strength and heat deflection temperature than polymer A . Additionally, polymer B has improved stress crack resistance. However, polymer B is prepared from 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfone and 4,4 biphenol. The 4,4 biphenol is difficult and costly to prepare and does not readily lend itself to commercial ization. Accordingly, a need still exists for a polymer which has the good combination of mechanical properties of polymer A and improved environmental stress crack resistance. A novel class of amorphous thermoplastic polymers has been discovered which can be easily prepared, are inexpensive and thus lend themselves to commercialization. They possess an excellent combination of mechanical properties. Additionally, these novel polymers display high notched izod impact values, high heat distortion temperatures and have excellent environmental stress crack resistance. THE INVENTION This invention is directed to novel amorphous thermoplastic polymers. The polymers of this invention contain units of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R is independently hydrogen, C1 to C6 alkyl, or C4 to C8 cyc loalkyl, a is independently an integer of 0 to 4 and n is independently an integer of 1 to 3. The units are attached to each other by an Obond. The ratio of unit I to unit II is in the range of from 55 45 to 95 5 preferably from 70 30 to 85 15. The preferred polymer of this invention contains units of the formula EMI3.2 These units are attached to each other by an 0 bond. The polymers of this invention have a reduced viscosity of from about 0.4 to about Z.5 or greater, as measured in N methylpyrolidone, or other suitable solvent at 25 C. The polymers of this invention are prepared by reacting the monomers represented by the following formulae EMI4.1 wherein R, a, and n are as previously defined, and X is independently selected from C1, Br, F, NO2, or OR. The ratio of the concentration of OR groups toC1, Br, F andior NO2 groups used to form the polymer is from about 0.90 to about 1.10, preferably from about 0.98 to about 1.02. The monomers, represented by formulas III and IV , include the following bydroquinone, 4,4 dihydroxybiphenyl, 2 me thylhydr oquinone, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 dinitrodiphenyl sulfone, and the like. The preferred monomers include hydroquinone, 4,4 dichiorodiphenyl sulfone and 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone. The polymers of this invention are prepared by contacting substantially equimolar amounts of the hydroxy containing compounds depicted in formulas III and IV supra and halo and or nitro containing compounds depicted in formula III , supra with from about 0.5 to about 1.0 mole of an alkali metal carbonate per mole of hydroxyl group in a solvent mixture comprising a solvent which forms an azeotrope with water in order to maintain the reaction medium at substantially anhydrous conditions during the polymerization. The temperature of the reaction is kept at from about 120 to about 1800 C, for about 1 to about 5 hours and then raised and kept at from about 200 to about 250 C, preferably from about 210 to about 230or, for about I to 5 hours. The reaction is carried out in an inert atmosphere, e.g.,nitrogen, at atmospheric pressure, although higher or lower pressures may also be used. The polymer is then recovered by conventional techniques such as coagulation, solvent evaporation, and the like. The solvent mixture comprises a solvent which forms an azeotrope with water and a polar aprotic solvent.The solvent which forms an azeotrope with water includes an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, and the like. The polar aprotic solvents employed are those generally known in the art for the manufacture of polyarylether sulfones and include sulfur containing solvents such as those of the formula R1 S b R1 in which each R1 represents a monovalent lower hydrocarbon group free of aliphatic unsaturation, which preferably contains less than about 8 carbon atoms or when connected together represents a diva lent alkylene group with b being an integer from 1 to 2 inclusive. Thus, in all of these solvents all oxygens and two carbon atoms are bonded to the sulfur atom.Contemplated for use in this invention are such solvents as those having the formula EMI6.1 where the R2 groups are independently lower alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and like groups, and aryl groups such as phenyl and alkylphenyl groups as well as those where the R2 groups are interconnected as in a divalent alkylene bridge such as EMI7.1 in tetrahydrothiophene oxides and dioxides. Specifically, these solvents include dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylsulfone, diphenylsulfone, diethylsulfoxide, diethylsulfone, diisopropylsulfone, tetrahydrothiophene 1,1 dioxide commonly called tetramethylene sulfone or sulfolane and tetrahydrothiophene l monoxide. Additionally, nitrogen containing solvents may be used. These include dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl formamide and N methylpyrolidone. The azeotrope forming solvent and polar aprotic solvent are used in a weight ratio of from about 10 1 to about 1 1, preferably from about 7 1 to about 5 1. In the reaction, the hydroxy containing compound is slowly converted, in situ, to the alkali salt thereof by reacting with the alkali metal carbonate. The alkali metal carbonate is preferably potassium carbonate. Water is continuously removed from the reaction mass as an azeotrope with the azeotrope forming solvent so that substantially anhydrous conditions are maintained during the polymerization. It is essential that the reaction medium be maintained substantially anhydrous during the polycondensation. While amounts of water up to about one percent can be tolerated, and are somewhat beneficial when employed with fluorinated dihalobenzenoid compounds, amounts of water substantially greater than this are desirably avoided as the reaction of water with the halo and or nitro compound leads to formation of phenolic species and only low molecular weight products are secured. Consequently, in order to secure the high polymers, the system should be substantially anhydrous, and preferably contain less than 0.5 percent by weight water during the reaction. Preferably, after the desired molecular weight has been attained, the polymer is treated with an activated aromatic halide or an aliphatic halide such as methyl chloride or benzyl chloride, and the like. Such treatment of the polymer converts the terminal hydroxyl groups into ether groups which stabilize the polymer. The polymer so treated has good melt and oxidative stability.In this application there are definitions of alkyl cycloalkyl and similar groups by stating the range of carbon atoms of them. It is intended that by these definitions each member of the defined groups is disclosed per Se. Examples The following examples serve to give specific illustrations of the practice of this invention but they are not intended in any way to limit the scope of this invention. In these examples, all parts and percentages are on a weight basis unless otherwise specified. The following Examples 1 to 4 describe the preparation of a random terpolymer. Example 1 A four neck 1000 ml round bottom flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, addition funnel, dry nitrogen inlet, and vacuum racketed vigreux column with Dean Stark trap and condenser. Into the flask were charged 143.58 g 0.50 moles of 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfone, 62.58 g 0.25 moles of 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 27.56 g 0.25 moles of hydroquinone, 76.02 g 0.55 moles of potassium carbonate, 100 ml of toluene and 466 ml of sulfolane. The mixture was purged with nitrogen for 1 hour at room temperature and then heated to reflux 141 C . After 1 hour at reflux, the temperature of the reaction was increased to about 200 C by slowly removing the toluene.After about 5 hours at 200 C, the reaction was terminated by adding methyl chloride. The polymer so produced was recovered by coagulation in water followed by washing the polymer several times with hot water 800.c . A theoretical yield of the polymer was obtained. The polymer had a reduced viscosity of 0.61 dl g as measured in N methylpyrolidinone 0.2 g 100 ml at 250 C. The polymer was made up of the following repeating unit EMI9.1 Examples 2 to 4 The procedure as described in Example 1 was exactly repeated except that the mole ratio of 4,4 dihy droxy diphenyl sulfone DHDPS and hydroquinone HQ was varied and is shown in Table I.
