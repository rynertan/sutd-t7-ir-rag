The local order of the semiconductor may vary from an all parallel pentagonal tube like structure preferred to a layer like puckered sheet structure. For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the present invention, reference may be made to the following detailed description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 illustrates a diogranunatic cross sectional view of a thin film Schottky barrier field effect transistor MESFET according to the present invention Figure 2 illustrates a diogrummatic cross sectional view of a thin film insulated gate field effect transistor IGFET , a type of metal insulated field effect transistor MISFET according to the present invention Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 illustrate alternative forms of thin film MISFETS according to the present Invention and Figure 7 illustrates on alternative form of thin film MlSFET, similar to Figure 4, according to the present invention. The same reference characters refer to the same elements throughout the several views of the drawings . According to the present invention, thin film transistor structures may be formed on glass substrates utilizing amorphous KP15 as the active semiconductor. For example, to form a MESFET, as illustrated in accompanying Figure 1, a high resistivity KP15 layer may be deposited on a glass substrate by RF diode plasma sputtering. Then, an n layer of KP15 doped with approximately 1 nickel may be formed in the same sputterer without breaking the vacuum. Metal contacts, which are preferably titanium, may then be deposite d by electron beam evaporation. According to the present invention, insulated gate field effect transistor IGFET structures, as illustrated in accompanying Figure 2 may be formed by first depositing a titanium gate on glass by electron beam evaporation, then depositing an insulating layer of, for example, SiO2, A1203 or Si3N4 by conventional electron beam deposition, sputtering or, preferably, by plasma enhanced CVD. Prefer ably, however, there is deposited as insulating layer P3N5 by RF plasma sputtering utilizing a nitrogen atmosphere and providing P4 molecules utilizing the method and apparatus disclosed in as yet unpublished EuropeanApplication 84 304 414.0. The source and drain contacts may then be deposited on the insulating layer and a semiconductor layer of KP15 deposited thereover.Alterna tively, the gate may be deposited on top of the semiconductor layer, as illustrated in dotted lines in accompanying Figure 2, rather than being deposited on the glass substrate, as illustrated in .solid lines. The semiconductor KP15 preferably has deposited therewith slightly less than 2 of nickel, iron or chromium, which reduces the density of defect levels in the bandgap without significantly increasing the conductivity of the semiconductor. Alternatively, the semiconductor may be heavily doped, that is, with greater than 1 2 , preferably about 1 , nickel, iron or chromium, which effectively increases the conductivity to form a device which is normally ON and may be turned off by the field effect rather than an undoped normally OFF device which is turned on by the field effect. Various forms of thin film transistors that may be formed according to the present invention are illustrated in accompanying Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 Some of these have the advantage that adjacent semiconductor and insulating layers may be deposited successively in a plasma sputterer without breaking the vacuum. An n region of heavily doped 2 3 Ni KP15 may be deposited directly under the source and drain as illustrated in accompanying Figure 7. These layers are highly conductive and provide good contact between the main semiconductor body and the source and drain. A field effect transistor is called a unipolar transistor to distinguish it from the bipolar junction transistors in which both types of carriers p and n are involved. The field effect transistor is a three terminal device in which lateral current flow is contra led by an externolly applied vertical electric field. A Schottky barrier thin film field effect transistor tha is a thin film metal semiconductor field effect tron sistor MESFET structure according to the present invention is illustrated in accompanying Figure 1. It comprises a glass substrate 20, a high pnictide polypnictide semiconductor 22 of high reistivity, a metal approximately 1 Ni doped layer 24 of the same semi conductor material of lower resistivity and metal source 26, gate 28 and drain 30 contacts deposited on layer 24. The n channel is modulated by a Schottky barrier at the interface of the gate and the n layer. The insulated gate field effect transistor IGFET is the most general device of this nature and the most applicable to thin film transistors TFT . In the most general form, the channel is modulated by a metal insulator semiconductor junction, that is, the device is a metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor MISFET .Such a device according to the present invention is illustrated in accompanying Figure 2. Here, a glass substrate 32 has deposited thereon a metal gate contact 34.An insulating layer 36 is deposited over the gate 34 and the glass 32. Then, metal source and drain 38 and 40, respectively, are deposited on the insulating layer 36.According to the present invention, a semiconducting polypnictide layer 42 is then deposited over the source and drain and the exposed I layer 36 over the gate 34.The I layer may be an oxide, an insulating dielectric or a combination thereof. Alternatively, the gate 44 may be located on top of the semiconductor layer 42 as illustrated in dotted lines. Commonly fabricated thin film transistor structures such as illustrated in accompanying Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6, may be formed according to the present invention utilizing a polypnictide semiconductor. The semiconductor layer according to the present invention may be a high resist ivity undoped polypnictide in which case the devices are normally OFF and switched ON by the field effect. Alternatively, the semiconductor may be heavily doped with approximately 1 metal to increase the conductivity thereof, in which case the devices would be operated normally ON and turned OFF by the field effect. If the devices employ a high resistivity undoped semiconductor metal content less than about 1 2 , it is desirable that heavily doped n layers be utilized under the source and drain for good contact to the undoped emiconductor. For example, as illustrated in accompanyingFigure 7, the glass substrate 46 has first deposited thereon a metal gate 48, then the insulator layer 50, then ihe high resistance, undoped semiconducting polypnictide 52, then the doped n layers 54 and 56, which are just under the metal source and drain 58 and 60. A device having such a structure would have a low current carrying capability and require a low voltage at the gate. Such a device would be most suitable for addressing liquid crystal matrix arrays. Thin film transistors according to the present invention may be fabricated as follows Referring to accompanying Figure 2, a plurality of metal gate electrodes, such as electrode 34, are deposited on the glass substrate 32. Various suitable metcis may he employed, however, titanium is preferred since it may be deposited by electron beam evaporation, shows no reaction on with polypnictides and sticks well to glass. The length of the gate, that is, the distance betweer the source and drain 38 and 40, may vary from 10 to 0 microns m The thickness of the gate is not itical but ray conveniently be from 2,000 to 6,000 angs toms 10 10m . For example, 7059 glass has ben utili d as rhe substrate in an electron beam evaporator at am temperature. The metal gate electrodes may be ci ined by lithosrophic techniques, such as lift off. The insulating layer may be conventional, z at is, SIO, may be deposited by electron beam evaporatitn on the las 32 and gates 34, heated to from 300 to 400 or Awl 203 may be deposited irt an electron beam evapot J or also on a vested substrate. An Si3N4 insulating layer 3 may be deposited according to known techniques on a om temperature substrate by RF diode sputtering. Alternatively, these materials, SiO2, A1203 andSi3N4, may preferably be deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. However, it is believed that P3N5 would provide the best I layer for such devices. While it may be deposited by a two source thermal deposition technique, as utilized in the prior art to apply it to 111 V semiconductors, it is preferred to deposit P3N5 by the method and in the RF diode sputtering apparatus disclosed in EP A 132 323, for example, utilizing the continuous pnictide delivery system disclosed in as yet unpublished European Application 84 304 414.0. A nitrogen atmosphere is used and P4 species supplied by the pnictide delivery system phosphorus bubbler , the substrate being heated to approximately 300 C. In all cases, the insulating layer may be from 1,000 to 5,000 angstroms 10 10m in thickness and it may be defined by depositing through a photoresist or utilizing a lift off technique. After the I layer has been deposited, source 38 and drain 40 may be deposited by conventional electron beam evaporation to a thickness of from 2,000 to 4,000 angstroms 10 10m . Various suitable metals may be employed, however, it has been found that titanium is best for pnictide containing insulating and semiconducting layers, such as P3N5 and KP15. A polypnictide semiconducting layer 42 is then deposited in accordance with the two above identified disclosures in an RF diode sputterer utilizing the continuous pnictide source for P4 species. Preferred polypnictide semiconductors correspond to the following formula MP wherein M represents on alkali metal P x represents a pnictide and x ranges from 15 to infinity.The preferred pnictide is phosphorus, the preferred alkali metal is potassium and x is preferably 15. Furthermore, KP15 wherein P represents phosphorus is the preferred material. However, minor amounts of other pnictides, such as arsenic, antimony and bisrnuth, may be incorporated into the dominant phosphorus pnictide semiconductor layer. The semiconductor laxer 42 is preferably from 5,000 to 10,000 angstroms 10 10m in thickness. Those skilled in the art will understand that struc tures wherein the semiconductor and insulator layers are deposited successively, suc as semiconductor, then insu lator Figure 3 , insulator, then semiconductor Figure 4 , have the advantage that the polypnictide semiconductor and a pnictide containing insulator P3N5 or Si3N4 may success ively be deposited in an RF plasma sputterer without breaking the vacuum. It is preferred that a compatible metal be incorp orated into the polypnictic. semiconductor layer to reduce the density of defect levels in the bondgap, but not so much as to cause a significant increase in conductivity. It has been found that app ximately 2 or a little less of nickel, iron or chromius for example, performs this function and that nickel i preferred. Such highly resists layers provide for normallyOFF devices. Alternatively, norm ly ON devices may be provided by incorporating approxima ely 1 or more of the same metals which increase the rnductivity of the semiconductor. Other methods may be employed to deposit the high pnictide polypnictide semi inducting layers of such devices, such as chemical vapour de.tsition or molecular flow deposition, as disclosed i the above related applications. The semiconducting layers y range from 5,000 to 10,000 angstroms 10 10m in thictress. Now, referring to 0 xnponying Figure 7, when the semiconductor 52 is of hic .resistivity, that is contains no more than approximately 1 2 of metal additive, it is preferred to provide heavily doped, that is 2 3 metal, layers 54 and 56 under the source and drain to provide for good contact between the source and drain. These layers, which are typically from 500 to 3,000 angstroms 10 10m thick, are heavily doped with 2 3 iron, chromium or nickel, for example, preferably nickel. These layers may be deposited in the same sputtering apparatus as the semiconductor layer 52, without breaking the vacuum utilizing a composite target of KP15 and nickel as disclosed in EP A 132 323.ss. The metulzcontacts 58 and 60 which again are preferably titanium, are deposited as a source and drain. It is preferred to use lithography to define the source and drain and to etch the polypnictide layer 52 bock to the insulator 50 to isolate individual devices on a single glass substrate 46. Holes are etched through the insulating layer 50 to access the gates 48. In the MESFET structure illustrated in accompanyingFigure 1, the n layer is typically from 5,000 to 10,000 angstroms 10 10T1 in thickness. The high resistivity layer 22 of KP15 is deposited on gloss 20 in an RF sputtering apparatus as disclosed in above identifiedEP A 132 323 from a KP15 target and thereafter the n layer of KP15 doped with approximately 1 nickel is deposited in the some apparatus without breaking the vacuum from a composite target as disclosed therein. In this example, there was utilized an argon otmos phere, pressed KP15 targets in the sputtering apparatus to deposit the KP15 layers and added metal pieces to targets used to deposit doped KP15 layers, all as disclosed in the above mentioned reference. Excess P4 was supplied using the phosphorus bubbler disclosed in the above identified as yet unpublished European Application 84 304 414.0. When the structure permits, successive undoped and doped layers may be deposited by switching between appropriate targets and the I layers of P3N5 or Si3N4 may be deposited by switching to a nitrogen atmosphere and using the phosphorus bubbler for P3N5 or a silicon target for Si3N4, all without breaking the vacuum. All of the thin film layers of the various structures and articles exemplified herein are preferably amorphous.
