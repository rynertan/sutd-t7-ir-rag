## Description
The invention relates to large scale integrated circuit memories. In particular, it relates to a memory system of the EEPROM type, logically organized as a plurality of uniform sections of rows and columns of memory cells forming a plurality of bytes of memory, each section including a writing circuit, each row in each section including one memory cell for each column in the section, and wherein each byte of memory is formed by a plurality of memory cells, one in each section, that have corresponding row and column locations within the sections, selection means being provided for each section for upon selection of a particular byte simultaneously connecting each memory cell associated with the byte to the write circuit, each said writing circuit thereby being enabled to change information in its associated cell from a first state to a second or vice versa independent of the change another writing circuit may be making in the information stored in its associated cell. This application is related to another application EP A 131 343 entitled One Step Circuit Arrangement for EEPROMS filed concurrently herewith, assigned to the same assignee as this application. One type of EEPROM is described in the US Patent No. 4,090,258, comprising memory cells each with two variable threshold transistors per memory cell that are written in opposite directions concomitantly by applying a polarizing voltage across the gate insulator of each transistor. By utilizing two variable threshold devices per memory cell, data is sensed by the difference in the conductances of the two devices providing a wider detection window. Each memory section however, comprises two row decoders, one for each single transistor per memory cell. Due to these two aspects, two programmable transistors per memory cell and two row detectors per section, the known memory requires a lot of circuitry and interconnections on the data organizing level giving rise to a considerable power consumption, as well as to substantial substrate area. Another type of EEPROM is described in the article by Clinton Kuo et al entitled An 80 ns 32 K EE PROM using the FETMOS Cell published in IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. SC 17, No. 5, October 1982, pages 821 827. The memory disclosed in that article uses floating gate field effect transistors for its memory cells. In the arrangement disclosed in the article an individual cell of a particular byte cannot be charged separately from the other cells of that byte. Thus, in order to charge any cell of a byte all cells of that byte have to be charged whether they are to remain in the charged state or not. This clears the selected byte and allows those selected ones of its cells which are not to remain in the charged state to be discharged as desired. This can require two cycles of operation in order to change information in any particular cell of a byte namely, an erasing cycle where all of the selected cells of the memory are charged and a programming cycle where chosen one of the cells are discharged. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved EEPROM array arrangement. A memory system of the EEPROM type in accordance with the invention is characterized in that each cell includes a floating gate field effect transistor Q One of the features of the invention is that each of the memory cells of a byte of memory is connectable to its own writing means separate from the writing means of the other cells of that byte. In this way one cell of a byte can be charged while another is simultaneously discharged. Advantages of the invention are the decreased time it takes to change information in the array, the lower power consumption the smaller substrate area and the simpler architecture related to the data organizing level. Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description and appended claimed when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawing in which Referring to Figure 1, there is shown therein a first of eight sections of an EEPROM array, each section containing 8192 memory cells arranged in 32 columns and 256 rows. Four floating gate field effect transistors R Each of the memory cells of the first section further comprises two row select conventional field effect transistors identified by the references R All the memory cells in a column of the first section are associated with two column select field effect transistors, such as OQ By referring to Figure 2 it will be understood that there is shown therein identical memory cells as just described for the first section except that Figure 2 shows the memory cells for the eight section of the EEPROM array. Sections two through seven are not shown for simplification purposes, each being identical to sections one and eight. Each section contains one memory cell of each eight cell byte of the array. Thus by selecting the same row and column in each section one can read out or write into all eight cells of the associated byte. For simplification purposes hereinafter each memory cell floating gate transistor will be designated as Q The drains of each gate select transistor Q Reading and writing circuit RWM for each section comprises a gate column select circuit comprising transistors Q All transistors shown in Figure 3 are field effect N channel devices except for transistors Q Also shown in Figure 3 is a representative writing means for one section of the array including an input signal latch DIL and an output signal latch DOL. The inputs of output signal latch DOL are connected to lines 8 and 9 of reading and writing circuit RWM which is also part of the representative writing means. Output line VDO of the writing means is connected to one input of a comparison means comprising exclusive OR EO. The input of data input latch DIL is connected to data input line DIN and its output line VDI is connected to the second input of exclusive OR EO. The output of the exclusive OR is connected to an input of switch SW. Another input is connected to line WE. The output from switch SW is connected to terminal 20 of reading and writing circuit RWM. It will simplify the explanation of the operation of data input latch DIL if it is understood that in accordance with the invention a writing operation is always preceded by a reading operation. This provides that feature of the invention which causes a writing operation to take place only if the data in a memory cell is to be changed. In addition, data input latch DIL only needs to be switched if the next input to a cell is different from the last input through the latch. Thus, if the last input switched the latch to place a binary 1 on line VDI, this caused N channel gate N4 in Figure 4 to turn on which maintains a binary 0 at terminal 51. This keeps P channel gate P3 on and V If it is desired to change a cell from a binary 1 to a binary 0, the conditions recited above prevail when the reading cycle begins, except that a binary 0 appears on line DIN. This turns on P channel gate P2 and maintains N channel gate N1 off. During reading cycles the signal on line VPGM is low and this turns on P channel gate P1. Thus V To change a cell from the binary 0 level to the binary 1 level, the conditions recited at the end of the paragraph above prevail when the reading cycle preceeding the writing cycle begins. Then a binary 1 appears on line DIN. This turns gate N1 on and maintains gate P1 off. During reading cycles line Data output latch DOL Figure 5 provides a binary 1 signal along line VDO when line 8 is at binary 0 and line 9 is at binary 1. It provides a binary 0 signal along line VDO when line 8 is at binary 1 and line 9 is at binary 0. With a binary 0 on line 8 gate P5 Figure 5 is on and gate N5 is off. V In the alternative condition with line 8 high and line 9 low, gates N5, N6 and P8 are turned on to apply ground potential binary 0 to line VDO. Exclusive OR EO produces a binary 1 signal if either one but only one of its input lines VDI or VDO carry a binary 1. In all other conditions it provides a binary 0 for its output line PHI. Assuming a binary 1 applied along VDI and a binary 0 along VDO, gate P10 Figure 6 is turned on to apply a binary 0 to gate N13 to turn it on. At the same time gate N14 is on and ground or binary 0 is applied through it and gate N13 to gate P15 to turn it on which applies a binary 1 along line PHI. If binary 1 signals appear along both lines VDI and VDO gates N9 and N10 are both turned on applying binary 0 s to gate P10 and P13 to turn them on also. One applied a binary 1 to gate N16 and the other to gate N15 turning both on to apply ground potential binary 0 along line PHI. If binary 0 s are applied along both line VDI and VDO, gates P12 and P14 are both turned on to apply binary 1 signals to gates N15 and N16. These both turn on again to apply a binary 0 along line PHI. If a binary 0 is applied along line VDI and a binary 1 along line VDO, gate P9 is turned on to apply a binary 1 to gate N11 turning it on. Gate N12 is turned on by the binary 1 along line VDO. These then connect ground to gate P16 turning it on to apply V Shown in Figure 7 is the detailed circuitry of switch SW for transferring the voltage applied to terminal 20 of reading and writing circuit RWM from the reading potential V When a writing operation is desired line VPGM goes high and line Assuming a change in information is desired when VPGM goes high gate N18 is turned on. When PHI goes high gate N19 is turned on and ground potential is applied to both N21 and N24 turning both off. This removes V The operation of one memory cell will now be described with reference to Figure 3. To read a particular cell as is well known, a select voltage is applied to the column select line associated with that cell as well as to the row select line associated with that cell thereby addressing or selecting the cell. It is to be understood that the same row select line and column select line is simultaneously selected in each of the eight sections thereby addressing the whole byte. That is the only row select line and column select line so selected in each section and thus only one cell is selected in each section. Assume row zero and column zero to have been so selected, the select voltages source not shown cause transistors Q If the floating gate of memory cell Q If a writing cycle is to take place the reading cycle as just explained is conducted preliminary to the writing operation. During a writing cycle a binary 0 or a binary 1 is applied along line DIN to data input latch DIL. As explained in connection with Figure 4, either of these signals causes data input latch DIL to produce the corresponding signal at its output and apply it along line VDI to the upper input of exclusive OR EO. Since a writing operation is necessary only if the data in the memory cell is to be changed exclusive OR EO is used to determine this requirement. As explained in connection with Figure 6, if the data stored in a memory cell is the same as that applied along line DIN either two zeroes or two ones are applied along lines VDI and VDO to the inputs of exclusive OR EO. In either case a binary 0 is applied from the output of exclusive OR EO along line PHI to switch SW. This prevents a writing cycle from commencing since it is not needed in view of the fact that the information in the associated cell is not going to be changed. Assuming a binary 1 is stored in transistor Q Assuming a binary 0 is stored in transistor Q By comparing Figure 1 with Figure 2 it can be seen that when column 0 and row 0 are selected both the memory cell R With this arrangement it can be further seen that exclusive OR EO of the writing means of each section of the array enables the writing voltage to be applied only to the reading and writing circuit RWM associated with a cell where information is to be changed. This prevents such cells from being written into when not necessary. Moreover, the separation of each of the bits of every byte into separate sections enables the writing circuits to write information in a first state into one selected cell containing information in a second state while simultaneously writing information in the second state into another selected cell containing information in said first state. Thus, assume the memory cell in a first bit position of column zero, row zero, namely R From the foregoing it is to be understood that various modifications to the above described arrangement of the invention will be evident to those skilled in the art. The arrangement described herein is for illustrative purposes and is not to be considered restrictive.
