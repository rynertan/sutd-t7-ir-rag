# Process for producing stable S adenosyl L methionine salts.

## Abstract
A process is described for the large scale industrial production of any stable SAMe salt at very high purity and with a yield of about 90 or more. The new process is characterised by the following basic operations a production of yeast containing 12 20 g kg of SAMe, b cell lysis and recovery of the SAMe rich lysate, c ultrafiltration of the lysate, d passage through weak acid ion exchange resin, e passage through absorption resin, f concentration by reverse osmosis, g spray drying the con centrated aqueous solution of SAMe salt.
