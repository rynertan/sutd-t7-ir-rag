# Channel selection in a switching system having clustered remote switching modules.

## Abstract
An arrangement comprising a host switching system and a number of remote switching modules which are directly interconnected such that voice and data traffic as well as control information can be conveyed between mod ules without being routed through the host system network. The arrangement allows the integrated standalone operation of the remote switching modules and advantageously reduces traffic through the host system network during nor mal operation. For each pair of remote switching modules, one of the modules selects the channels of the direct inter connection which are used for conveying information bet ween the modules.
