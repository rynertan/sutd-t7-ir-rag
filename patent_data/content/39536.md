# Shape selective reactions with zeolite catalysts modified with group 1A metals.

## Abstract
A process for the conversion of aromatic com pounds to dialkylbenzene compounds rich in the 1,4 di alkylbenzene isomer. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a particular type of zeolite catalyst having a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and a con straint index of about 1 12, said catalyst having been modified by treatment with metal compounds of ele ments from Group IA of the Periodic Chart, and option ally phosphorus, to deposit a minor proportion of such elements on the zeolite.
