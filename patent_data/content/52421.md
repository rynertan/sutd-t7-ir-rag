# Vinyl chloride polymerisation process.

## Abstract
Polymerisation of vinyl chloride in aqueous suspension using a polymerisation reactor having adherently deposited on internal surfaces thereof a build up suppressant coating comprising a product of build up suppressant activity form able by and preferably formed by the condensation of an effective 1 naphthol preferably 1 naphthol itself and for maldehyde. The condensation is preferably effected in a base catalysed reaction it may also less preferably be effected in an acid catalysed reaction. The coating product itself and a process for its production are also claimed.
