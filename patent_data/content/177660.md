## Abstract
A radiator with a horizontal heat exchanger 1 con sisting of a tubular vessel 2 containing a substance which is present in both gaseous and liquid form, such as freon or equivalent, which is evaporated by the aid of a heat source 3 disposed inside the heat exchanger, such as a heating conduit passing therethrough, and to said vessel baing connected a heat releasing element 4 , in which the sub stance in gaseous form releases heat to the surrounding air, condensing at the same time. An element 4 of the type known in the art cannot stand the requisite pressures. The radiator of the invention is characterized in that the element 4 consists of a plurality of vertical pipes 5 attached to the top margin of the vessel 2 .

## Description
RadiatorThe present invention concerns a radiator with a horizontal heat exchanger consisting of a tubular vessel containing substance in the form of both gas ad liquid, such as freon or equivalent, which is vaporized by the aid of a heat source, such as a heating conduit, placed therein, arid to said vessel being corrected a heatrelessing element from which the substance in gaseous form gives off heat to the air outside arid simultaneously condenses.A radistor of this kind has been disclosed for instance in theSwedish patent application No 7707821 0. A drawback of the radis tor of prior art is that the element does not tolerate the required pressures. It is also known in the art to tiake the element of one pipe installed in zigzag configuration and which can stand the requisite pressures but the differential temperature between the beginning ad the ed of the pipe is excessive, owing to the great of the pipe.The object of the present invention is to eliminate the drawbacksMentioned ad to provide s radiator of a novel type. The radiator of the invention is characterized in that the element is composed of a plurality of vertical pipes joined to the upper Margin of the vessel. By the aid of the invention, the radiator can be Made to stand the pressures to be imposed on it. Since several pipes are provided, the temperature of the radiator will, be uniform over the entire length of the radiator, in spite of the length of the radiatorAn advantageous entodinent of the invention is characterized in that the pipes have bee connected, two and two, at their top ends by a horizontal pipe section.It is easy froti the viewpoint of tianufacturing technology to bend U shaped pipe sections of which the ends are connected to the heat exchanger. In this Mariner the pipes support each other, arid the open pipe ends need not be plugged. Another enbodinent of the invention is characterized in that the top ends of the pipes have been connected to another horizontal heat exchanger. The sane radiator can therefore be used for both heating arid cooling. In heating, a war liquid, such as central heating water, is supplied into the lower heat exchanger. In cooling, a cold liquid is supplied into the upper heat exchanger, whereby the radiator then operates as a cooler.The invention is described in the following br the aid of examples, reference being made to the drawing attached, wherein Fig. 1 presents the radiator of an embodiment in vertical section.Fig. 2 presents part of s radiator of another enbodinent in vertical section.Fig. 3 presents in top view part of a radiator in which the pipes have been provided with heat radiation and flow through plates.Fig. 4 presents the radiator of a third enbodinent in vertical section.The radiatior comprises a horizontal heat exchanger 1, which consists of a tubular vessel 2 containing a substance present in both gas arid liquid forn, such as freon or equivalent, which evaporates by the aid of a heating conduit 3 passing through the heat exchanger. To the vessel 2 has bee connected a heat releasing element 4, in which the substance i gaseous forti releases heat to the outside air, and simultanously condenses. The element 4 is conposed of a plurality of vertical pipes 5 attached to the top Margin of the vessel 2. In Fig. 1, the pipes 5 have beer conencted with each other, two and two, by a horizontal ppe section 6. In Fig. 4, the top ends of the pipes 5 have been connected to another horizontal heat exchanger 7.The operation of the radiator is as follows. When the warn water flowing through the heating conduit 3 heats the freon ir the vessel 2, the freon evaporates and travels upwards into the pipes 5 as shown by arrows i Figs 1 arid 2. The vapour releases its heat to the outside air, through heat radiating plates 8 and flow through plates 9 known i themselves i the art. The vapour condenses and settles in the forn of droplets on the inner walls of the pipe 5 and further o runs down into the heat ex changer, where the above mentioned process continues. If the radiator is used as a cooler, as i Fig. 4 cold liquid is introduced in the upper heat exchanger 7, which causes the freon in the heat exchanger to condense ad to run by the pipes 5 to the lower heat exchanger 1. The pipes 5 now cool the surrounding air.The freon condenses and rises in the pipes to the heat exchanger 7, and the sane process continues.It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the invention is not confined to the examples presented in the foregoing and that itMay vary within the scope of the claims stated below.
