# Improved substrate bias generator.

## Abstract
An improved substrate bias generator for MOS integrated circuits is described. The generator includes circuitry 45.70 for generating two trains of periodic pulses which are approxi mately phase opposite, one of the pulse trains being slightly delayed as compared to the other pulse train. The two pulse trains are applied to a pumping circuit 85 which generates a target voltage and initially transfers a positive charge into the substrate, and thereafter transfers a positive charge out of the substrate. The positive charge transferred out of the substrate is greater than the positive charge transferred into the sub strate when the absolute value of the potential on the sub strate is less than the target voltage. Otherwise, a net positive charge is transferred into the substrate. In this manner, the ab solute value of the potential on the substrate is driven towards the target voltage.
