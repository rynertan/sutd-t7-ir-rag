## Description
PYRIDINE DERIVATIVES This invention relates to new pyridine derivatives and more particularly it relates to new dihydropyridine derivatives which possess antihypertensive properties. Many 2,6 dialkyl 4 aryl l.4 dihydropyridine 3,5 dicarboxylate derivatives are known which inhibit the movement of calcium ions in the cardiovascular system of warm blooded animals, and which thereby produce an anti hypertensive effect. The most used of these is nifedipine, which is dimethyl 1,4 dihydro 2,6 dimethyl 4 o ni trophenylpyridi ne 3 ,5 dicarboxyl ate. Also known are many l aryloxy 3 ami no propan 2 ol derivatives which possess beta adrenergic receptor blocking properties and which also produce an antihypertensive effect. Two of the most used of these are propranolol and atenolol, which are respectively l naphth l yloxy and l p carbamoylmethylphenoxy 3 isopropyl ami nopropan 2 ol. The only described attempt to combine these two types of chemical structure into one molecule is reported by Merzk workers in the Journal of MedicinalChemistry, 1981, Vol. 24, pages 628 to 631, in which a 3 amino 2 hydroxypropoxy substituent was introduced into the 4 aryl substituent of a 4 aryl l,4 dihydropyridine derivative, without much success in producing a compound with antihypertensive activity of the type sought by the authors. We have now found that compounds which do possess useful anti hypertensive activity may be obtained by suitably combining a 3 aryloxy 2 hydroxypropylamino moiety with a 1,4 dihydropyridine moiety. According to the present invention there is provided a dihydropyridine of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is alkyl or alkoxyalkyl each of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, each is alkyl of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein R4 is alpha branched chain alkyl or hydroxyalkyl each of up to 6 carbon toms, or alpha branched chain arylalkyl or aryloxyalkyl each of up to 12 carbon atoms, or acylaminoalkyl wherein the acyl is of up to 10 carbon atoms and the alkyl is of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein benzene ring A bears one or more substituents selected from halogen, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl and alkyl of up to 6 carbon atoms or bears the substituent N O N attached to the 2 and 3 positions that is, to form a benzo 2 ,l ,3 oxadiazole nucleus wherein Ar is phenylene, naphthylene, tetrahydronaphthylene, indanylene or pyridylene which is unsubstituted or which bears one or more substituents selected from halogeno, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, amino, nitro, carbamoyl and cyano, and alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkoxyalkoxy, alkyl thio, alkanoyl, carbamoylalkyl and alkanoylamino each of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein p is O or 1 wherein X is O or NH wherein X1 is a direct link or is O , S , NH or NHSO2 and wherein Y is straight or branched chain alkylene of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which may optionally be interrupted by one or two groups selected from oxygen O , sulphur S , imino and substituted imino NR5 wherein R5 is hydrogen, alkyl or alkanoyl each of up to 10 carbon atoms, phenyl or aralkyl of up to 12 carbon atoms , phenylene, substituted phenylene, pyridylene, cycloalkylene of up to 6 carbon atoms, 1,4 piperazinediyl, 1,3 or 1,4 piperidinediyl and amido CONH or NHCO groups or an acid addition salt thereof. It will be observed that the dihydropyridine derivative of the invention possesses at least two asymmetric carbon atoms, namely the carbon atom of the CHOH group in the alkanolamine chain, and the carbon atom at the 4 position of the dihydropyridine nucleus, and it can therefore exist in racemic and optically active forms.

The dihydropyridine derivatives of the invention may be manufactured by any chemical process known to he useful for the manufacture of chemicallyanalogous compounds. One preferred process for the manufacture of a dihydropyridine derivative of the invention comprises the reaction of an epoxide of the formula EMI7.1 wherein A, R1, R2, R3, X, X1, Y, Ar and p have the meanings stated above, with an amine of the formulaR4NH2 wherein R4 has the meaning stated above, or when p is 0, the reaction of said amine with a haloketone of the formulaEMI7.2 wherein A, R11 R2, R3, X, X1, Y and Ar have the meanings stated above and whereín Hal stands for a halogeno group, for example bromo, followed by reduction, for example with sodium borohydride, of the aminoketone thus obtained. The reaction may be carried out in an alcoholic diluent or solvent, for example in isopropanol, at a temperature of up to the boiling point of said diluent or solvent. A second preferred process for the manufacture of a dihydropyridine derivative of the invention wherein the group Y is alkylene interrupted as stated above comprises joining the two parts of the molecule at the point of interruption of Y. Thus, for example, when Y is alkylene interrupted by an amido group NHCO , the process comprises the reaction of an amine of the formula EMI8.1 wherein A, R1, R2, R3 and X have the meanings stated above, with an acid of the formula H02C X1 Ar C OCH2 CHOHCH2NHR4 wherein X1, Arr p and R4 have the meanings stated above, or with an activated derivative thereof, and wherein yl and y2 are such that Y1 NHCO Y2 has the same meaning as stated above for Y.

As stated above, the dihydropyridine derivatives of the invention possess anti hypertensive activity. This may be demonstrated by the ability of the compound to reduce the blood pressure of a spontaneously hypertensive rat, or of a rat made hypertensive by treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate, or of a dog made hypertensive by the Goldblatt technique of unilateral nephrectomy and clipping of the contralateral kidney. These are all standard tests used to demonstrate anti hypertensive effects of medicaments. Some of the dihydropyridine derivatives of the invention possess beta adrenergic blocking properties, some of them possess calcium ion slow channel blocking properties and some of them possess both such activities. A preferred dihydropyridine derivative of the invention possesses both such activities.
