# Inversion polymerization process for producing vinyl resins.

## Abstract
Process of producing vinyl polymers by an inversion polymerization technique in the presence of a coating on the internal surfaces of the polymerization reactor. By inversion polymerization is meant conducting the initial stage of the polymerization reaction wherein the monomer or monomers being polymerized constitute the continuous phase and, in the latter stage of polymerization, water constitutes the continuous phase. The coating is comprised of a water soluble suspending agent, such as an alkyl or alkyl hydroxyalkyl cellulose ether. By means of this process, polymer buildup on the internal surfaces of the reactor is reduced.
