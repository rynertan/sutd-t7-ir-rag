# A hand held hammer tool.

## Abstract
A hand held electrically powered hammer tool with a ro tor type electromotor 17 and a hammer mechanism 14 ar ranged in a machine housing 13 . The hammer mechanism 14 includes a drive shaft 24 with an excentric crank pin 35 thereon for a piston rod 43 connected to a drive piston 40 reciprocably movable in a cylinder 42 for driving a hammer piston 41 towards a working tool 16 via an air cushion 44 between said pistons. The drive shaft for the hammer mecha nism 14 is also the rotor shaft of the electromotor 17 which means that the hammer mechanism and the motor are driven by the same speed. The electromagnetically active parts 23, 49 of the rotor 18 are located autside surrounding the cor responding parts 21, 22 of the electromotor stator 19 thus enabling the rotor also to be a flywheel and a fanwheel.
