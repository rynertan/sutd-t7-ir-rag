# Olefin polymerization catalyst and process for the polymerization of olefins.

## Abstract
Catalysts effective for the polymerization of olefins at high productivity formed upon mixing 1 a solution of a titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxide or a zirconium tetrahydrocar byloxide and an organoaluminum halide with 2 a dihydro carbylmagnesium compound alone or admixed with a minor amount of a trialkylaluminum and 3 combining the product obtained in 2 with a metal halide selected from a silicon tetrahalide and a titanium tetrahalide. The catalyst compo nent thus produced can be combined with an organoalumi num compound as a cocatalyst comonent.
