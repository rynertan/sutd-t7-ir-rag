## Description
This invention relates to an optical method for forming a hologram, and particularly to such a system including means for the suppression and for enhancement of optical features. The present invention is described below in relation to the inspection of periodic grids or masks such as the photomasks used to pattern the etch and doping steps used in integrated circuit fabrication. The method can be used to suppress the periodicity of IC masks and, at the same time, enhance or maximize the image intensity of nonperiodic defects. In the past, digital techniques have been used for the inspection, for defects, of two dimensional fields such as integrated circuit masks. Generally, such techniques use a dual scanning microscope system and sophisticated algorithms for comparison and detection. Typically, however, such digital techniques are complicated and time consuming. Unlike digital techniques, optical systems offer the advantage of parallel processing. Furthermore, there is no excessive requirement of accuracy in the output in terms of the actual intensity at each point. Rather, it is sufficient that the signal associated with a defect be much stronger than the signal associated with the surrounding periodic or quasi periodic structure, so that, for example, a thresholding operation can be used to determine the defect location. Optical spatial filtering techniques to perform defect enhancement have been examined in the past with regard to such applications as the inspection of electron beam collimating grids and silicon diode array targets for television camera tubes, as well as to the inspection of photomasks used in integrated circuit manufacture. The optical spatial filtering systems used a filter in the Fourier plane to attenuate the discrete spatial frequencies of the periodic portion of the mask, so that, upon retransformation only defects were present in the output. While the results of such systems were promising, the usefulness of the technique was limited by the fabrication time of the filter, and by the need to use high quality, low f number lenses when inspecting objects of large dimensions. Recently, this second constraint has been removed by employing holographic recording of the output combined with phase conjugate read out. See, for example, R.L. Fusek, et al, Holographic Optical Processing for Sub Micron Defect Detection , Proceedings of the SPIE, Vo. 523, January, 1985. A three step process is involved, however first, a photographic filter is made, recording the Fourier spectrum of a mask to be tested second, a hologram of the mask is recorded in the output plane using the filter to block the periodic portion of the spectrum and finally, after processing the hologram is illuminated by the phase conjugate of the reference beam and the defect enhanced image is found in the output plane. This method has been used to detect submicron defects. However, it has the disadvantage, in addition to the above mentioned requirement of a three step process, that the process must be tailored to each mask and type of mask. That is, a new hologram must be recorded for each mask to be inspected and a new filter must be made for each type of mask. This method is also used in WO83 02831, wherein aberrations introduced by the system optics are compensated for, thus allowing the use of lower quality higher f number lenses. This system provides an optical system for forming a hologram of an object from an object beam of electromagnetic radiation transmitted or reflected from said object comprising a non linear optical medium for recording a hologram optical transform means for performing forward and inverse transform operations on said object beam and optical means for directing said object beam through said optical transform means to thereby direct the forward transform of said object beam onto said recording medium to form a hologram of the object beam transform therein. The present invention provides an optical method of selective image suppression and enhancement of selected features of an object as described in claim 1. When using Fourier transforms, the system can provide non linear filtering or suppression operations using a photorefractive crystal which is located in the Fourier domain. The transform of the object beam is focused onto the crystal, along with a reference beam of lower intensity than the peak values in the Fourier transform of the object beam. In the Fourier domain, the spectrum of the periodic or quasi periodic structure consists of a series of bright and sharp Fourier components, corresponding to the harmonics of the periodic object such as a photomask. Also present in the Fourier domain are much broader and much weaker contributions of light corresponding to small defects in the periodic structure. Intensity inversion in the photorefractive crystal suppresses the strength of the bright spikes from the periodic components, in comparison to the strength of the weaker light from the defects. The method provides the capability to enhance selected features or suppress selected features or to enhance selected features while suppressing others. The application of a read out beam which, typically, is the phase conjugate of the reference beam, provides an image consisting primarily of the defects, with the periodicities missing or greatly reduced in intensity. This enhancement process takes place in real time, in the sense that the mask or other object is introduced at the input and, within a short time, such as a few milliseconds, an image of the defects appears. This non linear filtering technique has many other applications. These include, for example, in addition to the inspection applications mentioned previously, the industrial inspection of meshes used in chemistry and biology, and the inspection of shadow grids used in color TV tubes. Nonlinear optical media suitable for use in the system include other photorefractives, ferroelectrics, organic inorganic materials exhibiting second and third order non linear susceptibilities, materials exhibiting resonant transitions and semiconductor materials. Examples of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings in which Fig. 1 is a simplified block diagram which schematically illustrates the basic aspects of one embodiment of the present invention. Initially, a transform operation is applied as indicated at 9, such as, for example, using Fourier optics, to perform a forward transform operation on an input beam which contains a complex function, g, characteristic of an object or subject. The resulting Fourier transform 10 of the object beam is applied to a non linear optical medium, 11, and there interferes with a reference beam 12 to form a hologram in the medium. Then, the hologram is read out by beam 13 and an inverse transform operation is performed on the output beam 14, as indicated at 15, to provide an output, o, in the form of an optical beam which contains, for example, selectively enhanced intensity components and or selectively suppressed intensity components. In one specific application, described in detail with respect to Fig. 3, the object beam is obtained by transmitting a laser beam through a photomask of the type used for the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits. The non linear medium is a photorefractive crystal, whose non linear properties provide filtering or inversion of the intensity of the periodic aspects of the mask in the hologram. Phase conjugate read out four wave mixing and inverse transformation provide an image in which the intensity of non periodic defects is enhanced. Our technique for performing real time defect enhancement is based on two observations. The first is that the Fourier transform of a periodic object is an array of discrete spikes whose width depends inversely on the input field size and whose spacing depends inversely on the period of the mask. In contrast, the Fourier transform of a small defect is a continuous function which is several orders of magnitude less intense than the periodic spikes. It should be noted that other transforms may be used, such as the Mellin transform, to achieve similar results. The second observation is that the diffraction efficiency of a volume phase hologram formed in a photorefractive medium is maximized when the intensities of the two writing beams are approximately equal and decreases as the difference in intensity increases. For a reference plane wave having intensity, I A typical diffraction efficiency versus beam ratio curve 20 is plotted in FIG. 2 on a log log scale, assuming that the beam ratio, R I A Fourier optics analysis can be used to describe the propagation of light from the object to the crystal. Suppose the mask is rectangular with dimension W x L and a small transparent rectangular defect, located at x and where the sinc function is as defined in Bracewell. The Fourier Transform and its Applications , McGraw Hill, Inc., New York, 1978. Bracewell is incorporated by reference. The spatial frequency variables are related to spatial variables as u x λf and P u,v is the Fourier transform of p x,y . P 0,0 represents the transmitting area of one period of the pattern, and P 0,0 a² is the fraction of the mask area that is transmitting. The hologram should be recorded such that the intensity of the periodic portion of T u,v ² is greater than the reference beam intensity, and the intensity of the defect portion of T u,v ² is less than the reference beam intensity. Mathematically, if D is defined as the relevant dynamic range of the periodic portion and the light incident on the mask is I for an opaque defect. One example of a system used to obtain defect enhancement is shown in FIG. 3. The critical portion of the system, i.e., that portion corresponding generally to the system shown in FIG. 1, is identified by block 9. An Argon ion laser 17 λ 514.5 nm was collimated and split to form the two writing beams, i.e., the reference beam and the object beam, as well as the probe read out beam. Here, I Considering FIG. 3 further, the coherent radiation from the argon ion laser 17 was split by a variable attenuator beam splitter 19 into a first beam, the phase conjugate read out beam I It should be noted that the object 34 was at the front focal plane of the Fourier transform lens this is not a necessary condition, as the object could be placed anywhere in front of the lens , whereas the crystal was at the back focal plane. Read out was provided by the phase conjugate beam I The object mask 16 consisted of a 36 x 36 array of squares, each with sides of 150 µm micrometer . The spacing between the squares was 100 µm, so the period a was equal to 250 mm. The total mask size was 9 x 9 mm². Within this array were placed seven transmitting defects of sizes 100 x 100 µm², 100 x 50 µm² two defects , 100 x 25 µm² two defects , and 100 x 10 µm² two defects , as shown in FIG. 4A. The output of the optical system is shown in FIG. 4B, obtained using an applied voltage of 4 kV across the crystal. Please note the two smallest defects are not visible in FIG. 4A they do appear in the output of FIG. 4B, however. In FIG. 4B, the periodic background has been quite effectively suppressed, leaving the defects clearly visible. FIG. 5 shows an intensity scan of one line of the output image, illustrating the worst case signal to noise ratio obtained. The defect represented is one of the two 10 x 100 µm² spots. The system is easily capable of detecting even smaller defects. In recording the hologram, the object beam intensity at the mask I The resolution obtained in the output can be increased by, for instance, reducing the f of the optical system and using a crystal of larger dimensions , by increasing the size of the imaging elements of the CCD camera, each of which measured 23 µm x 13.4 µm , and or by using other non linear recording materials. While the above intensity inversion and defect examples illustrate application of the invention using the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, the invention is applicable as well to the other, invisible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as, for example, to X rays. In summary, a technology for selectively enhancing and or suppressing optical features in real time has been presented.
