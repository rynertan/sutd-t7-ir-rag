## Description
BIS BETA PENTABROMOPHENOXYETHYL SUCCINATE, A FLAME RETARDANT FOR ABS Description This invention is directed to bis beta pentabrcmo phenoxyethyl succinate and to a method for its prepara tion. The compound is particularly useful as a flame retardant for ABS. Highly brominated compounds such as the tetrabromo phenyl ethers and perbrominated biphenyl compounds are well known flame retard ants for a variety of thermoplastic resins. Although the flame retarding behavior of such compounds is adequate for many materials the tendency to migrate and to be exuded from the resin during processing, particularly where the compounds are employed at high concentrations in the resin, are distinct disadvantages. Methods in the art for overco ing the tendency of flame retardants to migrate during processing have included incorporating the brominated moiety into a polymeric structure, such as by grafting a bromine containing molecule onto an existing substrate, by directly brominating the substrate or by copolymerizing a suitable bromine containing monomer in the preparation of the thermoplastic.As an alternative, flame retardant molecules have been sought which possess an appropriate combination of solubility in the thermoplastic resin, adequate stability at resin processing temperatures, and sufficient ability to retard burying without resort to an inordinately high concentration in the resin. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the great proliferation of compounds available for use as flame retardants has come about in part because no single compound possesses a balance of these characteristics that is adequate for use in every thermoplastic resin. Most flame retardant compounds are known to be useful in a very limited class of thermoplastic resins, and the search for compounds having more effective balance of characteristics continues. This invention is directed to a new flame retardant for ABS resins, and more particularly to bis beta pentabromophenoxyethyl succinate, a compound having the following structure EMI2.1 This compound, a di pentabromophenoxyethyl ester of succinic acid, is thermally stable at temperatures well above the b√ßxzatures employed for melt processing ABS resins, is readily dispersible for maximum effectiveness in flame retardance, and has a lower tendency to migrate due to its high molecular weight and solubility in the resin. The flame retardant compound of this invention is the di ester of beta pentabromophenoxyethanol and succinic acid, bis beta pentabromophenoxyethyl succinate. It may be prepared by the ethoxylation of pentabromophenol a commercially available compound, with ethylene oxide to provide beta pentabromophenoxyethanol. The ester is prepared by esterifying two moles of the beta pentabromophenoxyethanol with succinic anhydride.Di esters of pentabromophenoxyethanol are unknown in the art. The corresponding succinate of pentachlorophenoxyethanol is disclosed in U. S. 3,123,580 as a plasticizer for PVC and polystyrene, however the synthesis disclosed is arduous and has not been applied or suggested for preparation of the compound of the instant invention. ABS resins are flame retarded when compounded with bis beta pentabromophenoxyethyl succinate. The compound of this invention is somewhat more effective than many brominated compounds, imparting self extinguishing characteristics to ABS resins at reduced concentrations.When compunded with a conventional synergist such as antimony oxide, substantial flame retardance results when as little as 10 wt of the brominated compound of this invention is present, and amounts above about 12 wt are effective in providing self extinguishing compositions. Conventional brominated flame retardants will be employed in larger amounts, and frequently amounts as great as 25 wt , are needed to provide self extinguishing compositions. The ABS resins that are usefully flame retarded by the compound of this invention are widely available commercially and include graft copolymers of acrylonitrile and styrene on a diene homopolymer or copolymer rubber substrate. Also included are the variety of analogous resins wherein all or a portion of the styrene component may be replaced with other vinyl arom atic monomers such as alpha methyl styrene and the like, and those wherein all or a portion of the acrylonitrile is replaced with methacrylonitrile, methylmethacrylate MABS and MBS and the like. Further analogs including the graft copolymers of styrene and acrylonitrile or the like on an acrylate rubber substrate are also useful.Although the ABS resins are described as graft copolymer resins, a variety of analogs are known wherein a rigid copolymer such as SAN or a methylmethacrylate acrylonitrile styrene copolymer is blended with a rubbery polymer such as a high rubber content styrene acrylonitrile butadiene ABS graft copolymer. As used herein, the term ABS is thus intended to incorporate the wide variety of engineering thermoplastic resins recognized in the art as ABS resins. The invention will be better understood by consideration of the following examples. Example 1. Synthesis of beta pentabromophenoxyethanol. Into four one pint citrate bottles were placed 180 ml deionized water, 2.3 g .057m NaOH, and 22 g .045m pentabromophenol. A magnetic stirring bar was added to each, and nitrogen was bubbled into each of the bottles for 3 min. The bottles were then sealed, contents were stirred while liquid ethylene oxide 12 ml was injected into each bottle through the seals in 2 ml portions over a 5 1 2 hr. period. The mixtures were stirred at room temperature for an additional 17 hers. The bottles were opened and the combined solid product was collected by filtration. The white product was washed twice with deionized water, dried in a vacuum oven at 760C to constant weight, then recrystallized from 850 ml toluene to give 39 g of pentabromophenoxyethanol ethanol, m.p. 163do. Example 2. Synthesis of bis beta pentabromophenoxyethyl succinate.
