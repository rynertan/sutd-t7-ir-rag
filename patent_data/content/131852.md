# AN AUTOMATIC LABELLING MACHINE FOR INCORPORATION TO CASE PACKAGING MACHINES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL, COSMETIC, AND THE LIKE PRODUCTS, BOTH OF THE CONTINUOUS AND INTERMITTENT FEED TYPES

## Abstract
An automatic labelling machine for incorporation to case packaging machines in general, of both the continuous and intermittent feed types using pushers, and including a printer head 9 and a wedge element 21 operative to break labels 5a away from a carrier web 11 being paid out from a web storage reel, and a carrier web take up reel, comprising a feeder 14 mounted rotatable about a parallel axis to the case feed plane and, hingedly connected peripherally thereto, osci llating arms 17a, 17b, 17c, 17d which are guided at the opposed ends thereof by an annular guide 18 having a cam profile 18a and carry a box like body 19 alternately subjec ted to a vacuum and adapted to receive one label 5a from said label detaching wedge element 21 , transfer it to an area of application thereof to a case moving along a case transport line, and apply it by pressure to said case also provided being a means of rotating said feeder 14 and driving said carrier web forward, as well as sensor and timer means effective to synchronise the rotation speed of said feeder to the case feed rate and determine start up and stop times for the web feed ing means and means of providing said vacuum.
