# Pattern matching device operable with signals of a compressed dynamic range.

## Abstract
A pattern matching device generally comprises a first circuit 36 for calculating an elementary similarity measure between two feature vectors, one and the other selected from two feature vector sequences representative of two patterns, respectively, and a second circuit 37 for iteratively calculating a recurrence formula which defines a recurrence value by a sum of such an elementary similarity measure and an extremum of a prescribed number of previously calcu lated recurrence values. The recurrence formula eventually gives an overall similarity measure between the two pat terns. The elementary similarity measure is now calculated by calculating a primitive similarity measure be a conven tional circuit 15 and subtracting a predetermined value therefrom by a compensation circuit 31 . Preferably, the second circuit 37 comprises circuitry 41, 42 for preventing the sum from overflowing outwardly of a preselected range.
