# Hood device for coupling cars.

## Abstract
A hood device for coupling cars comprises a first hood component 3 having one end secured to one of a pair of car bodies 1, 2 to be coupled with each other and a second hood component 4 having one end secured to the other car body and the other end adapted to be coupled with the other end of the first hood component, each of the hood components hav ing side wall panels 41, 42 provided on both side portions thereof. Each side wall panels includes a fixed side wall panel 41 having one end secured to the other end of the associated hood component, and a movable side wall panel 42 having one end mounted on the associated car body and adapted to be turnable about a substantially vertical axis and the other end resiliently urged such as to be directed to the inner sur face of the adjacent fixed side wall panel. The movable side wall panel 42 has a roller 57 at the other end thereof which is supported in such a manner that it can be rolled on the inner surface of the fixed side wall panel in the longitudinal direc tion of the car bodies and displaced by a predetermined amount in the vertical direction, thereby assuring smooth sliding movement between the fixed and movable side wall panels following variable running conditions of the cars.
