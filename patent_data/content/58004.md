## Description
INCLINED INSULATED RUNNER MULTICAVITY PLASTIC INJECTION MOLDINGFIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to an insulated runner mold and to insulated runner multicavity injection molding of plastics material. The invention permits the angle of inclination to the injection point of the surface of the product to be up to 90 rather than the typical 00. The angle of inclination to the injection point of the surface of an injection molded product is here defined to mean the smallest angle that the normal to the injection point makes with the production mold ejection opening direction. The normal to the injection point of the surface of the product is here defined to mean a line going through the injection point so that the is perpendicular to the tangent plane to the injection point of the surface of .the product. There may be a number of reasons for choosing to place the injection point of the surface of an injection molded product so that the angle of inclination is significantely larger than 0 , perhaps close to 90 . Some of these reasons are larger strength, less deformation or more beauty of the molded product.DISCUSSION OF PRIOR ART Heretofore multicavity insulated runner injection molding of a product with a small angle of inclination to the injection point of up to about 200 has been solved successfully by employing secondary gate runners which are not inclined to the mold opening direction. But in the situation where the angle of inclination has been more than about 20 , multicavity insulated runner injection molding has not been possible and manufacturing of products with an angle of inclination to the injection point of more than about 20 has had to be produced with other multicavity injection molding systems such as the submarine gate runner injection molding system or the hot runner injection molding system. Both of these systems have distinct disadvantages. In the submarine gate runner injection molding system a plastic impression of the submarine gate runner is produced simultaneously with the molded product. First this plastic impression has to be sorted from the molded product and then recycled by some costly process into the injection molding process.In the hot runner injection molding system the production cycle period is relatively long because some heat leaks from the heated hot runner manifold via the hot runner nozzles to the walls of the chilling cavities, thereby extending the required cooling period of the molded product. Impurities often get trapped in the hot runner system, thereby plugging the hot runner nozzle. Electrical heating elements often stop functioning, causing the hot runner system to freeze.Hot molten plastic often leaks out of the hot runner system, causing loss of material and reduced injection pressure and short circuited electrical heating elements. According to the present invention there is provided a production runner mold comprising a first mold part 302, 402, 502 and a second mold part 303, 403, 503 defining a mold cavity 304, 404, 504 therebetween, the first and second mold parts being movable relative to one another to allow release of a molded product from the mold cavity and defining a mold opening direction 320, 420, 520 , the second mold part being separably into first 307, 407, 517 and second sections 308, 408, 518 and a primary runner 310,, 410 , 510 in the first section leading into a secondary runner 311, 411, 511 in the second section characterised in that the secondary runner 311, 411, 511 is inclined to the mold opening direction. The present invention is not burdened by the problems and disadvantages of the submarine gate runner and hot runner systems and methods. Inclined insulated runner multicavity injection molding does not during its normal production cycle simultaneously produce any runner plastic impression which must be sorted from the molded product and recycled into the molding process. Inclined insulated runner multicavity injection molding has a short production cycle, does not easily trap impurities, is not dependent on heating elements and the leaking problem is solved. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of cyclic insulated runner multicavity plastic injection molding wherein the method of each production cycle comprises the steps of a injecting a hot molten plastic into a primary runner system of a multicavity mold b directing the injected plastic through the primary runner system to some inclined secondary runners which connect the primary runner system with some restriction gates c leading the directed plastic through the inclined secondary runners to the restriction gates which connect the inclined secondary runners with the chilling cavities d cooling the led plastic in the inclined secondary runners by transferring heat from the plastic to the walls of the inclined secondary runners which have a temperature which is lower than the temperature of the led plastic in a manner so that the plastic in the inclined secondary runners does not solidify in their entire cross sectional region but remains molten in a central zone of their cross sectional region e conducting the led cooled molten plastic through the restriction gates into the chilling cavities f cooling the conducted plastic in the chilling cavities by a cavity cooling system whereby the cooled plastic solidifies, thereby creating a molded product and g ejecting the molded product from the chilling cavities characterised in that , if for some reason the normal production cycle is terminated within the inclined secondary runners transfers additional heat to the walls of the inclined secondary runners whereby the molten plastic solidifies throughout its entire cross sectional region, the normal production cycle may hereafter be re established by the additional steps of h separating the mold part which contains the inclined secondary runners into two sections in order to expose the solidified impressions of the inclined secondary runners i removing the solidified impressions of the inclined secondary runners in such a manner that the impressions of the restriction gate on the solidified impressions of the inclined secondary runners are removed through the inclined secondary runner in a direction whih is not parallel to the mold opening direction and j recombining the two sections of the mold part which contain the inclined secondary runners. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a production mold illustrating the main parts without details Figure 2 is a schematic detailed diagram of an unsuccessful prior art production mold in the same position as the mold illustrated in Figure 1 and Figures 3, 4, an d 5 are FfESematic detailed dragrams ef preferred embodiments of production molds in accordance with the invention. The present invention is directed to a modified insulated runner system which may be called the cooled runner system for multicavity injection molding of polystyrene. The cooled runner system differs from the insulated runner system because, in order successfully to inject polystyrene in a prior art insulated runner mold made to injection mold, for instance, a polyolefine, it is necessary to make the following major alterations from the minimum requirements needed in order to injection mold the polyolefine 1 it is customary, when injection molding a polyolefine and employing an insulated runner system to increase the temperature of the injected polyolefine above the temperature required of such injected polyolefine when employing a hot runner system in the case of a polystyrene this increase in temperature must be larger. 2 it is customary when injection molding a polyolefine and employing an insulated runner system to increase the pressure of the injected polyolefine above the pressure required of such injected polyolefine when employing a hot runner system in the case of a polystyrene this increase must also be larger. 3 the cross sectional areas of the primary runner system must be enlarged. 4 the cross sectional areas of the secondary feeding runners must be enlarged. 5 the cross sectional areas of the gate restrictions must be enlarged. 6 the frequency of the normal production cycle must be increased. Experiments have shown, not only that the cooled runner system is possible, but also the surprising results that the cooling period could be reduced by approximately one second in each production cycle from the normal cooling period obtainable with a standard hot runner system. The shorter cooling period is an important contributing reason that the hot molten polystyrene in the hot runner system does not freeze. This is because there is not enough heat loss during the short cycle time available to cause the hot molten plastic in the runner system to freeze. Figures 3, 4 and 5, being the preferred embodiments of the present invention illustrate examples of cooled runner injection molding of polystyrene. Referring now to the drawings in detail, Figure 1 illustrates a basic production mold 101 which may be any one of the molds described in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 below.The production mold 101 is positioned in a clamping unit consisting of movable part 102 and the stationary part 103.Also illustrated is an injection unit 104 with a heating element 105 and an injection nozzle 106. In the past a prior art insulated runner mold 201, illustrated in Figure 2, has a movable mold part 202, which is connected to the movable clamping unit part 102,and a stationary mold part 203, which is connected to the stationary clamping unit part 103. The mold includes two chilling cavities 204, in each of which is formed a molded product 205, such as a drinking glass. Plastics material for molding via is introduced into the mold 201 a sprue bushing 206 which cooperates with the injection nozzle 106 shown in Figure 1 .The stationary part of the mold 203 is sub divided into first and second sections 217,218 which are attached together releasably along a parting line 219. The sprue bushing 206 is inserted in the first section 217 of the stationary mold part 203, and a primary runner system 209 of circular crosssection is channelled, through the sprue bushing 206, the first stationary mold section 217 and divides into two branches positioned in the parting surface 219. As a continuation of the primary runner system 209, secondary runners 211 also of circular cross section are positioned in the second stationary mold section 218. The secondary runners 211 are parallel to the mold opening direction 220 and lead, through restriction gates212, to the chilling cavities 204.The walls of the chilling cavities 204 contain a cavity cooling system 214 and each chilling cavity 204 has a stripper sleeve 216. In addition to the mold opening direction 220, there is also illustrated the normal 221 to the injection point 212 of the surface of the product 205 and the resulting angle of inclination 222 which is about 60 in this figure. The operation of the system, which is illustrated in Figure 2, and which is positioned as illustrated in Figure 1 is as follows hot molten plastics material 210 is injected by the injection unit 104 through the injection nozzle 106 into the primary runner system 209. The plastics material is directed through the primary runner system 209 to the secondary runners 211 through the restriction gates 212 which are of circular cross section and into the chilling cavities 204.While the molten plastics material flows through the primary runner system 209 and the secondary runners 211, heat is transferred to the walls thereof, due to their lower temperature.The temperature of the walls is lower than the temperature of the flowing polystyrene because the walls are cooled by the cavity cooling system 214. However, the temperature is such that plastic in the primary runner system 209 and in the secondary runners 211 does not solidify over the entire circular cross sectional region but remains molten in a central zone. The solid plastics outer portions of the primary runner system 209 helps to reduce or prevent any leakage of molten plastics material which otherwise may leak from the primary runner system 209 at the parting surface 219. The plastics material which does enter the chilling cavities 204 is cooled by the cavity cooling system 214 so that the remaining plastics material solidifies producing a molded product 205. At this stage the movable clamping unit part 102 is moved away from the stationary clamping unit part 103 whereby the movable mold part 202 is separated from the stationary mold part 203 and the molded product 205 is ejected by the stripper sleeve 214. Then the movable clamping unit part 102 is moved toward the stationary clamping unit part 102 whereby the movable mold part 202 is combined with the stationary mold part 203, which ends the normal production cycle and a new cycle is ready to begin. When for some reason, such as intent or malfuncton like an impurity plugging a restriction gate 212 the normal production cycle is terminated, then the molten polystyrene within the primary runner system 210 and secondary runners 211 lose additional heat and solidifies throughout its entire cross sectional region. The normal production cycle may hereafter be re established by attaching the second stationary mold section 218 to the movable clamping unit part 102 and disconnecting the second stationary mold section 218 from the first stationary mold section 217. Then the movable clamping unit part 102 is moved away from the stationary clamping unit 103 whereby the seconds . stationary mold section 218 is separated from the first stationary mold section 217 along the separation line 219 in order to expose the combined unit of the solidified impression of the polystyrene in the primary runner system 209 and the solidified impressions of the polystyrene in the secondary runners 211.The combined unit is hereafter removed and the movable clamping unit part 102, is moved towards the stationary clamping unit 103 whereby the second stationary mold section 218 is once again combined with the first stationary mold section 217 in order to reattach the second stationary mold section 218 with the first stationary mold section 217 and disconnect the second stationary mold section 218 with the movable clamping unit part 102, which leaves the system ready for the normal production cycle to begin. The reason that the system just described is not successful in practice is that the wall between the secondary runners 211 which are not inclined and the chilling cavity 204 is very thin, and will in an uneconomically short time deteriorate, thereby increasing the area of the cross sectional region of the restriction gates 212 preventing further production. The first preferred embodiment of this invention is illustrated in Figure 3. A cooled runner mold 301 has a movable mold part 302, which is connected to the movable clamping unit part 102, and a stationary mold part 303, which is connected to the stationary clamping unit 103.The cooled runner mold 301 includes two chilling cavities 304 each for enclosing a molded product 305 such as a drinking glass with a wall thickness of 0.7 mm. The cooled runner mold 301 also includes asprue bushing 306 which meets the injection nozzle 106. The sprue bushing 306 is inserted in a first section 307 of the stationary mold part 303. The first section 307 is attached to a second section 308 of the stationary mold part 303 and separated therefrom by a parting surface 309.A primary runnersSstem 310 of circular cross section is channelled through the sprue bushing 306, the first stationary mold section 307 and divides into two branches positioned in the parting surface 309. As a continuation of the primary runner system 310, inclined secondary runners 311 of circular cross section are positioned in the second stationary mold section 308. The inclined secondary runners 311 lead through restriction gates 312 to chilling cavities 304. The walls of the chilling cavities 304 contain a cavity cooling system 314 and each chilling cavity 304 has a strippper sleeve 316. Also illustrated is the mold opening direction 320. The operation of the system illustrated in Figure 3 and which is positioned as illustrated in Figure 1, is as follows hot molten high impact polystyrene 313 at a temperature of 250 degrees Centigrade and a pressure of 1500kg per sq cm. is injected by the injection unit 104 through the injection nozzle 106 into the primary runner system 310.The polystyrene is directed through the primary runner system 310 to the inclined secondary runners 311 and is conducted through the restriction gates 312, which have circular cross sectional areas with an average diameter of 1.8 mm, into the chilling cavities 304. While the molten polystyrene flows through the primary runner system 310 and the inclined secondary runners 311, both of which have an average diameter of 14 mm., heat is transferred to the walls thereof. The temperature of the walls is maintained lower than the temperature of the Sowing polystyrene because the walls are cooled by the cavity cooling system 314. However, the temperature is such that the polystyrene in the primary runner system 310 and in the inclined secondary runners 311 does not solidify over their entire circular cross sectional region but remains molten in a central zone.The solid outer portions of the cross sectional region help to reduce or prevent any leakage of molten polystyrene which otherwise may leak from the primary runner system 310 at the parting surface 309.The polystyrene which has entered the chilling cavities 304 is cooled in a short cooling period of 1.2 seconds by the cavity cooling system 314 whereby the cooled polystyrene solidifies, thereby creating a molded product 305. The movable clamping unit part 102 is moved away from the stationary clamping unit part 103 so that the movable mold part 302 is separated from the stationary mold part 303 and the molded product 305 is ejected by the stripper sleeve 316. Then the movable clamping unit part 102 is moved toward the stationary clamping unit part 103 whereby the movable mold part 302 is combined with the stationary mold part 303, which ends the normal production cycle with a cycle time of 2.3 seconds, and a new cycle is ready to begin. If for some reason a restriction gate 312 should become blocked, even though this gate has the large cross sectional diameter of 1.8 mm., the normal production cycle is terminated, then the molten polystyrene within the primary runner system 310 and the inclined secondary runners 311 loses additional heat causing the molten polystyrene to solidify throughout its entire cross sectional region. The normal production cycle may hereafter be re established by attaching the second stationary mold section 308 to the movable clamping unit part 102 and disconnecting the second stationary mold section 308 from the first stationary mold section 307.Then the movable clamping unit part 102 is moved away from the stationary clamping unit 103 whereby the second stationary mold section 308 is separated from the first stationary mold section 307 along the parting surface 309 in order to expose the combined unit 318 of the solidified impression of the polystyrene in the primary runner system 310 and the solidified impressions of the polystyrene in the inclined secondary runners 311.The combined until 318 is hereafter removed in such a manner that the impressions of the restriction gate 312 on the solidified impression of the inclined secondary runners 311 is removed through the inclined secondary runners 311 is a direction which is not parallel to the mold opening direction 320.In view of the inclination of the secondary runners 311 it is necessary to subdivide the combined unit 318 by breaking off the solidified impression of the primary injection system 310 in order to remove the solidified impressions of the inclined secondary runners 311. The movable clamping unit part 102 is then moved towards, the stationary clamping unit 103 whereby the second stationary mold section 308 is combined with the first stationary mold section 307 in order to re attach the second stationary mold section 308 with the first stationary mold section 307 and disconnect the second stationary mold section 308 with the movable clamping unit part 102, which leaves the system ready for the normal production cycle to begin. Since the secondary runners 311 are inclined, the wall between the secondary runners 311 and the chilling cavity 304 is not made so thin that it will deteriorate. Illustrated in Figure 4 is a second preferred embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment a cooled runner mold 401 has a movable mold part 402, which is connected to the movable clamping unit part 102, and a stationary mold part 403, which is connected to the stationary clamping unit 103. The cooled runner mold 401 includes two chilling cavities 404, each for enclosing a molded product 405 such as a drinking glass with a wall thickness of .55 mm. The cooled runner mold 401 also includes a sprue bushing 406 which meets the injection nozzle 106 and is inserted in a first section 407 of the stationary mold part 403.The first section 407 is attached to a second section 408 of the stationary mold part 403 and separated by a parting surface 409. A primary runner system 410 of circular cross section is channelled through the sprue bushing 406, the first stationary mold section 407 and divides into two branches positioned in the parting surface 409.As a continuation of the primary runner system 410, are inclined secondary runners 411,also of circular cross section, positioned in the second stationary mold section 408. The secondary runners 411 lead through restriction gates 412 to chilling cavities 404. The walls of the chilling cavities 404 contain a cavity cooling system 414 and the walls of the stationary mold part 403 contain a runner cooling system 415.Each chilling cavity 404 has a stripper sleeve 416. The mold opening direction is referenced 420. The operation of the system which is illustrated in Figure and which is positioned as illustrated in Figure 1, is as follows hot molten general purpose polystyrene 413 at a temperature of 270 degrees Centigrade and a pressure of 1500 kg per sq. cm. is injected by the injection unit 104 through the injection nozzle 106 into the primary runner system 410. The polystyrene is directed through the primary runner system 410, the average cross sectional diameter of which is 13mm., to the inclined secondary runners 411, the average cross sectional diameter of which is also 13 mm., and is conducted through the restriction gates 412 with circular cross sectional areas with an average diameter of 1.6 mm into the chilling cavities 404.While the molten plastic flows through the primary runner system 410 and the inclined secondary runners 411 heat is transferred to the walls of the primary runner system 410 and the walls of the inclined secondary runners 411,which have a temperature which is lower than the temperature of the flowing polystyrene due to the walls being cooled by the runner cooling system 415. However the temperature is such that the polystyrene in the primary runner system 410 and in the inclined secondary runners 411 does not solidify over their entire circular cross sectional region but remains molten in a central zone. The solid outer portions of the cross sectional region help to reduce or prevent any leakage of the molten polystyrene whih may leak from the primary runner system 410 at the parting surface 409. The polystyrene which has entered the chilling cavities 404 is cooled in a short cooling period of 0.9 seconds by the cavity cooling system 414 whereby the cooled polystyrene solidifies thereby creating a molded product 405. The movable clamping unit part 102 is moved away from the stationary clamping unit part 103 whereby the movable mold part 402 is separated from the stationary mold part 403 and the molded product 405 is ejected by the shipper sleeve 416. Then the movable clamping unit part 102 is moved toward the stationary damping unit part 103 whereby the movable mold part 402 is combined with the stationary mold part 403, wilcil ends the normal production cycle with a cycle period of 2.0 seconds, and a new cycle is ready to begin. When for some reason, such as an impurity plugging a restriction gate 412, even though this gate has the large cross sectional diameter of 1.6 mm, the normal production cycle is tenninated, then the molten polystyrene within the primary runner system 410 and inclined secondary runners 411 loses additional heat causing the molten polystyrene to solidify throughout its entire cross sectional region. The normal production cycle may hereafter be re established by attaching the second stationary mold section 408 to the movable clamping unit part 102 and disconnecting the second stationary mold section 408 from the first stationary mold section 407.Then the movable clamping unit part 102 is moved away from the stationary clamping unit 103 whereby the second stationary mold section 408 is separated from the first stationary mold section 407 along the parting line 409 in order to expose the combined unit 418 of the solidified impression of the polystyrene in the primary runner system 410 and the solidified impression of the polystyrene in the inclined secondary runners 411. The combined unit 418 is hereafter removed in such a manner that the impressions of the restriction gate 412 on the solidified impression of the inclined secondary runners 411 are removed through the inclined secondary runners 411 in a direction which is not parallel to the mold opening direction 420.In view of the inclination of the secondary runners it is necessary to subdivide the combined unit 418 by breaking off the solidified impression of the primary injection system 410 in order to remove the solidified impressions of the inclined secondary runners 411. Then the movable clamping unit part 102 is moved towards the stationary clamping unit 103 whereby the second stationary mold section 408 is combined with the first stationary mold section 407 in order to re attach the second stationary mold section 408 with the first stationary mold section 407 and disconnect the second stationary mold section 408 with the movable clamping unit part 102, which leaves the system ready for the normal production cycle to begin. Since the secondary runners 411 are inclined, the wall between the secondary runners 411 and the chilling cavity 404 is not made so thin that it will deteriorate. A third preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figure 3. In this embodiment a cooled runner, hot runner, combination mold 501 has a movable mold part 502, which is connected to the movable clamping unit part 102, and a stationary mold part 503, which is connected to the stationary clamping unit 103. The stationary mold part 503 consists of a first section 517, which is attached tothe stationary clamping unit 103, and a second section 518 separated by a parting surface 519. The mold 501 includes two chilling cavities 504, each for enclosing a molded product 505 such as a drinking glass with a wall thickness of .85 mm. The cooled runner mold 501 also includes a sprue bushing 506 which meets the injection nozzle 106 and is connected to a hot runner manifold 507. The hot runner manifold 507 is connected to two hot runner nozzles 508. A hot primary runner system 509, positioned in the first section 517 of the stationary mold part 503, is channelled through the sprue bushing 506, passing through the hot runner manifold 507 and through the hot runner nozzles 508 with gates 513 which lead to inclined secondary runners 511, positioned in the second stationary mold section 518. The inclined secondary runners 511 lead through restriction gates 512 to chilling cavities 504. The walls of the chilling cavities 504 contain a cavity cooling system 514 and each cavity has a stripper sleeve 516. The hot runner manifold 507 contains a heating system of heating elements 515. The mold opening direction is referenced 520. The operation of the system illustrated in Figure 5 and which is positioned as illustrated in Figure 1, is as follows hot molten polystyrene 510, such as high impact polystyrene, at a temperature of 230 degrees Centigrade, and a pressure of 1500 kg per sq. cm. is injected into the hot primary runner system 509 by the injection unit 104 through the injection nozzles 106. The hot polystyrene is directed through the hot primary runner system 509, and enters, through hot runner gates 513, the inclined secondary runners 511 which have circular cross sectional areas of an average diameter of 15 mm. From the secondary runners the polystyrene is conducted through the restriction gates 512 which are of circular cross section having an average diameter of2.0mm, into the chilling cavities 504. While the molten plastic flows through the inclined secondary runners 511, heat is transferred to the walls thereof due to its walls having a temperature which is lower than the temperature of the flowing polystyrene. This is because the walls of the inclined secondary runners 511 are cooled by the cavity cooling system 514. However, the temperature is such that the polystyrene in the inclined secondary runners 511 does not solidify over their entire circular cross sectional region, but remains molten in a central zone. The heating elements 515 heat the hot primary runner system 509 in order to reduce or prevent heat loss from the directed polystyrene. The polystyrene which has entered the chilling cavities 504 is cooled in a short cooling period of 1.4 seconds by the cavity cooling system 514 whereby the cooled polystyrene solidifies, thereby creating a molded product 505. The movable clamping unit part 102 is moved away from the stationary clamping unit part 103 whereby the movable mold part 502 is separated from the stationary mold part 503 and the molded product 505 is ejected by the stripper sleeve 516.Then the movable clamping unit part 102 is moved toward the stationary clamping unit part 103 whereby the movable mold part 502 is combined with the stationary mold part 503, which ends the normal production cycle with a cycle period of 2.5 seconds, and a new cycle is ready to begin. When for some reason, a restriction gate 512 becomes blocked, even though this gate has the large cross sectional diameter of 2.0 mm., the normal production cycle is terminated, then the molten polystyrene within the inclined secondary runners 511 loses additional heat to the walls of the secondary runners 511, causing the molten polystyrene to solidify throughout its entire cross sectional region. The hot molten polystyrene 510 in the hot primary runner system 509 on the contrary does not solidify because the heating element 515 heats the hot runner system 509.The normal production cycle may hereafter be re established by attaching the second stationary mold section 518 to the movable clamping unit part 102 and disconnecting the second stationary mold section 518 from the first stationary mold section 517. Then the movable clamping unit part 102 is moved away from the stationary clamping unit 103 whereby the second stationary mold section 518 is separated from the first stationary mold section 517 alongtheparting line 519 in order to expose the solidified impressions of the polystyrene in the inclined secondary runners 511.The solidify impressions are hereafter removed in such a manner that the impressions of the restriction gate 512 on the solidified impression of the inclined secondary runners 511 are removed through the inclined secondary runners 511 in a direction which is not parallel to the mold opening direction 520. The movable clamping unit part 102 is hereafter moved towards the stationary clamping unit 103 whereby the second stationary mold section 518 is combined with the first stationary mold section 517 in order to re attach the second stationary mold section 518 with the first stationary mold section 517 and disconnect the second stationary mold section 518 with the movable clamping unit part 102, which leaves the system ready for the normal production cycle to begin. Impurities do not get trapped in the hot runner nozzles 508 because the openings of the hot runner gates 513 are not restricted. There is a certain heat transfer from the hot runner nozzle 508 to the walls of the chilling cavity 504, but this is too far removed from the walls of the chilling cavities 504 to cause any significant heating thereof. Since the secondary runners 511 are inclined the wall between the secondary runners 511 and the chilling cavitiy 504 is not made so thin that it will deteriorate. While the above description discloses preferred embodiments of the invention by way of example, it will be understood that, other variations are possible within the scope of the invention. For example sandwich mold systems wherein the mold part which contains the secondary runners has chilling cavities on both sides of said mold part.
