# Implants, microbeads, microcapsules, and method for their preparation.

## Abstract
Implants, microbeads and microcapsules suitable for injection into an animal body comprise cross linked but physically native albumin and a non albumin substance, for example a steroid or a non steroid enzyme. The microcap sules are formed under mild conditions not above 37 C and pH 4 10 from either a native albumin and a non denaturing bi functional cross linking agent or a self polymerizable albumin derivative. The method may be used to immobilize living cells such as yeast.
