# Plastics material ball structure with inflating valve.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a plastics material ball structure 1 provided with an inflating valve, comprising an outwardly open housing 2 which radially extends inwardly. The housing 2 is effective to receive a valve body 10 of elongated shape, ending with a capillary hole 13 which may be expanded by the inflating needle 20 and which is adapted for tightly closing as the inflating needle 20 is withdrawn. The valve body 10 is provided, at a middle portion of its outer surface, with a frustum of cone shaped projection 11 , effective to be inserted into an abutment groove 4 as formed on the housing 2 for anchoring the valve body 10 in the inside of the groove 4 . The housing 2 is axially aligned with the valve body 10 and, at the capillary hole 13 , defines a through going hole 3 therethrough the inflating needle 20 is able to pass.

## Description
The present invention relates to a plastics material ball structure,provided with an inflating valve. As it is known, plastics balls are moulded by a spin moulding method and, as they are withdrawn from the mold, they are in a substantially inflated condition. The presently used apparatus for making said balls provides for inflating the balls by such a system which does not afford the possibility of further inflating the ball as, upon use, a air pressure loss occurs inside the ball itself. Presently inflating valves are only applied to expensive types of balls, such as the leather balls provided with bladders, since the presently available inflating valve means would be excessively expensive for application to plastics balls. Accordingly, the task of the present invention is to solve the hereinabove mentioned problem, by providing such.a plastics material ball structure, provided with inflating valve, which, while being comparatively simple both construction wise and in operation, is able of affording the possibility of inflating the ball at any desired time in particular as a pressure loss occurs inside the ball, Within that task, a main object of the present invention is to provide such a plastics material ball structure, with inflating valve, which, while being very simple construction wise, is very reliable in operation. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a plastics material ball structure which is effective to be easily made starting from easily available materialsandwhich, moreover, is of a very reduced cost. According to one aspect of the present invention, the above task and objects, as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a plastics material ball structure, with inflating valve1 characterized in that it comprises an putwardly open housing, radially extending inwardly, said housing being effective to house a valve body of elongated shape, ending with a capillary hole, effective to be expanded by an inflating needle and adapted for tightly closing as said inflating needle is withdrawn. Further characteristics and adavantages of the present invention will become more apparent hereinafter from the following detailed description of a plastics material ball structure with inflating valve, being illustrated, by way of example and not of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawing, where Fig. I is a schematic view illustrating the plastics material ball structure according to the invention Figv 2 is a detail view illustrating the inflating valve associated to the ball structure according to the invention, as the inflating needle is withdrawn therefrom and Fig. 3 is a detail view illustrating the inflating valve with the inflating needle inserted therein. With reference to the above Figures, the plastics material ball structure, according to the invention, indicated overally at the reference number 1, is provided with a housing 2, formed as a single body with the ball, during the ball making step, which housing is open outwardly and substantially radially inwardly extends. The housing 2 is provided, at the bottom thereof, with a passage hole 3, whereas at a middle portion of said housing an abutment groove 4 is formed, said groove being of greater width than the housing and having advantageously a substantially cilindrical shape. Into the housing. 2 a valve body may be inserted, indicated overally at the reference number 10, which has a substantially elongated shape and is advantageously made of a resilient material. The mentioned valve body 10 is provided, at the region thereat the abutment groove 4 is formed, with a frustum of cone shaped projection 11, which affords the possibility of inserting the valve body 10 into the housing 2, in a locked engagement re lationship therewith, in such a way as to engage with the abutment groove 4 edge. The valve body 10 is provided, in the inside thereof, with a further housing or seat 12, which axially extends from the open end, outwardly facing, as far as the inner end thereat a capillary hole 13 is formed. Into said housing or seat 12 an inflating needle 20 may be pressure inserted, in such a way as to cause said capillary hole 13 to expand thus the inflating needle will be inserted through the throughgoing hole 3 in such a way as to bring its air inlet port 21 in the inside of the hole 1, thereby the ball may be accurately and fully inflated. As the inflating needle 20 is withdrawn, by removing it from the seat 12, the valve body 10, being made of a resilient material, will resiliently reclose. More specifically, the capillary hole 13 will resiliently tightly reclose, thereby providing a perfect diaphragm between the outside environment and the ball inside, thereby air is prevented from leaking in such a way as to hold the inflating pressure at a constant value. Advantageously, the inner end portion of the valve body 10 is of rounded shape, correspondingly to the housing 2, thereby the inside pressure practically provides a clamping effect on the capillary hole 13 in such a way as to improve the tightness characteristics. From the above disclosure it should be noted that the invention fully achieves the intended task and objects. In particularly the great constructional simplicity of the valve body is to be pointed out, which, in actual practice, consists of a single elongated resilient element which may inserted into the housing 2 and locked therein, the housing 2 being formed during the moulding of the ball. Moreover, the provision of a capillary hole affords the possibility of making a valve body free of any movable elements or springs, which would be susceptible to greatly increase the cost of the valve itself. In practiaing the invention, the used materials, though the best results have been obtained by using the above mentioned materials, as well as the size and shapes may be any according to the needs.
