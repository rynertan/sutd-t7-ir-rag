# Sails.

## Abstract
The luff area 21, 22, 23 of a sail 20 is stabilised by arrang ing the directional stability of the sail material to help support the load on the luff area of the sail between the head 12 and the tack 13. Different sail constructions utilize triangular or trap ezoidal panels 22 along the luff area of the sail so that the line of maximum directional stability of the material in each panel is arranged to counteract the lines of stress appearing in the sail between the vicinity of the head and the vicinity of the tack when under load and properly tensioned. A similar technique can ce used to stabilise the foot area 41, 42, 43 of the sail.
