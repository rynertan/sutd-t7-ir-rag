The ureas of the above formula are used as substituents for carnauba and or montan wax.For many applications the object will be to obtain good processing properties in combination with minimum volatility. According to the invention the secondary, tertiary or quaternary amines are made up then of at least two structural units of the above formula.Suitable compounds are obtained when the secondary, tertiary or quaternary amines are made up of 1 up to 3 substituted or unsubstituted alkyl groups having up to 22 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl groups having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms and or polyalkylene oxide containing groups having from 2 to 30 alkylene oxide units each containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms.Suitable for use are a great many substitutes, such as lower alkyl or alkoxy groups, a halogen atom, a cyano group or a nitro group.Highly valuable compounds are obtained if use is made of a hydroxyl group or an amino group. The amines of the above formula can be obtained through reduction in a known manner from the corresponding nitrile. The nitrile is prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acid having the formula EMI3.1 where R, Z, Q, a, b, x and y have the above indicated meanings.The preparation of nitriles from carboxylic acids is well known in the art See e.g., Houben Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, 4 Ed., Bd. Viii, pp. 335 338 .According to a preferred process the carboxylic acid while in the liquid phase is converted into a mixture of carboxylic acid amide and nitrile, followed by a vapor phase step in which conversion into the nitrile is completed with the aid of a dehydration catalyst.The primary amines are produced by hydrogenation using about 0.5 to 5 , preferably about 1 to about 2 , of a catalyst such as Raney nickel at hydrogen pressures of 10.105 140.105 Pa and a temperature in the range of 1100 to 2000 C, or cobalt catalyst at hydrogen pressures of 5 5 5 about 40.105 to about 140.105 Pa, preferably about 65.105 to about 110.105 Pa, and at a temperature from about 800C to about 2000C, preferably about 1450 C. Increased primary amine formation is favored by the use of alkaline conditions or ammonia plus a lower alcohol. Secondary amine formation is favored by higher temperatures 1750 2500C , exclusion of water, and continuous venting of ammonia.Although both batch and continuous processes may be employed, it is believed preferable to utilize a continuous process.Tertiary amines built up of one or two structural units according to the invention and two or one lower aliphatic radicals may be prepared by different methods.Methyl groups may be introduced by the reaction between a primary or secondary amine having one or two branched chain units according to the invention and formic acid and formaldehyde in accordance with the following reaction EMI4.1 Mixed tertiary amines may also be prepared by reductive alkylation of a branched chain primary or secondary amine according to the invention.The amine is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of an aldehyde, which may be represented by the following reaction EMI4.2 The alkylene oxide derivatives of the present invention are prepared by the bringing a branched chain primary amine according to the invention into reaction with a lower alkylene oxide such as ethylene or propylene oxide. The amino substituted secondary amines df the invention are prepared from a primary amine having the first mentioned structural formula and acrylonitrile, followed by catalytic hydrogenation to the diamine EMI4.3 The salts of the amines of the present invention may be derived both from organic and inorganic acids. Suitable inorganic acids include phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid. Suitable organic acids are formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and rosin acid.The quaternary ammonium compounds according to the invention may be prepared by introducing up to 3 methyl groups into the formula of claim 1 with the aid of methyl chloride.The ureas of the present invention are prepared by reacting a compound of the general formula above wherein z is 0 and R2, R3 or both are hydrogen, with an isocyanate. The isocyanates to be used in the preparation of the ureas of the present invention may be of an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic character. If few or no colored products are desired, then it is preferred to use aliphatic isocyanates. Preference is further given to isocyanates of the general formula A R4 NCO, where R4 represents a cyclo aliphatic hydrocarbon having from about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, a phenyl group or naphthyl group, which groups may be substituted or not with one or more lower alkyl groups having 1 to 8, and preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, lower alkoxy groups having 1 to 8, and preferably 1 to 6 carbons atoms, aryl, for instance phenyl, and halogen such as chlorine or bromine, and A represents a NC0 group, or an R CH, R NCO R, NCO group where R5 has 5 2 6 n7 the meaning of a simple bond or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, n is an integer from 0 to 10 or higher, and R6 andR7 may be the same or different and are selected from the same group as R4.As examples of suitable monoisocyanates may be mentioned ethyl isocyanate, hexyl isocyanate, 2 ethylhexyl isocyanate, butyl isocyanate, stearyl isocyanate. As examples of diisocyanates which can be defined by the formula OCNRNCO, where R represents a divalent aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic group, may be mentioned hexamethylene diisocyanate dimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate metaxylene diisocyanate paraxylene diisocyanate tetramethylene diisocyanate.In the case where R represents an aromatic group, it may be substituted with a halogen, a lower alkyl or a lower alkoxy group.As examples of such diisocyanates may be mentioned l chloro 2,4 phenylene diisocyanate 2,4 toluene diisocyanate a mixture of 2,4 toluene diisocyanate and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate tetramethylphenylene diisocyanate diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate metaphenylene diisocyanate paraphenylene diisocyanate 1,5 naphthalene diisocyanate biphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate 4,4 isopropylidene diphenylisocyanate benzophenone 4 ,4 diisocyanate diphenylether diisocyanate or diphenylsulphide diisocyanate 3,3 dimethyldiphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate 3,3 dimethoxydiphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate 3,3 dichlorodiphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate benzofuran 2 ,7 diisocyanate. Examples of diisocyanates having a cycloaliphatic group include isophoron diisocyanate, dicyclohexyl methane diisocyanate and 1,4 cyclohexane diisocyanate.The temperature at which the reaction takes place between the amine and the isocyanate depends on the reaction components. It will generally be in the range of 100 to 2000C.The reaction of the amines according to the invention with the isocyanate compounds is carried out in a known manner. The conversion may be carried out in the melt or in an inert solvent.Examples of suitable solvents include methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, chlorobenzene, methylethyl ketone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, glycolmonomethylether acetate, glycol formal, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, benzoic methyl ester or acetophenone.If the conversion is carried out in solvents, especially relatively low boiling ones, such as methylene chloride, the solvents may be distilled off as the reaction progresses.The starting product required for the preparation of the present amines is obtained by reacting an a olefin having 6 to 45 carbon atoms with acetic anhydride at a temperature in the range of 1000 to 1400C in the presence of a catalytic amount of an at least trivalent manganese compound. The a olefin may consist of a pure olefin fraction, such as l octene, or of a mixture of a olefins having 6 to 45 carbon atoms. If use is made of a mixture of a olefins the number for n in each separateR radical may, independently, of the other R radicals in the structural formula of the acid and of the amine to be prepared therefrom, assume any value equal to the number of carbon atoms minus two of an a ale fin present in the mixture.The most favourable results are generally obtained at a reaction temperature in the range of 1150 to 1250C in the presence of manganic acetate as initiator. To prevent oxidation of the substrate the concen tration of the manganic acetate is preferably chosen between 10 3 and 1 moles per litre.The concentration of the olefin fraction is dependent on the desired percentage of branched chain monocarboxylic acids in the reaction product.If use is made of an ale fin fraction having not more than 12 carbon atoms, preference is usually given to a relatively high percentage of branched chain acids. If, however, use is made of an olefin fraction having 20 to 45 carbon atoms, then there is found to be a strong preference to a mixture of monocarboxylic acids which contains at least 70S by weight of the addition product of 1 mole of olefin to 1 mole of acetic acid. In all cases the reaction conditions will be so chosen that ultimately at least 10 by weight of the branched chain amines conforms to the first mentioned structural formula. For the preparation of branched chain monocarboxylic acids from which the amines according to the above formula are derived, the molar ratio of converted olefin to manganic acetate is at least 4. It has been found that under these last mentioned conditions the composition in weight of the mixture of telomeric acids and, hence, of the amines prepared therefrom is for nv 17 only dependent on the molar ratio of a olefin to manganic acetate and the concentration of the a olefin during the reaction.With a monocarboxylic acid obtained by reacting one a olefin with acetic acid being indicated by R1, a monocarboxylic acid obtained by reaction with two a olefins by R2, a monocarboxylic acid obtained by reaction with three a olefins by R3, etc., then, for instance, the following weight distributions were obtained respectively before and after removal of the R1 fraction. before distillation after distillation wt wt R1 30,7 0,3R2 20,4 19,8R3 21,4 33,6R4 13,0 21,5R5 9,4 15,9 R, 6 5,1 8,8The structural formulae of R3, R4 and R5 all conform to the firstmentioned formula. R1 is an unbranched acid of the formulaR CH2 3 C00H and, if n 3 to 9, it is preferably removed from the reaction mixture. The fraction of R2 is formed by two acids of the formula EMI8.1 For a man skilled in the art it is obvious that, especially if use is made of an olefin fraction having 30 or more carbon atoms, it is not possible in actual practice to separate the linear acids from the acids having a very high molecular weight and a high degree of telomerization.The same applies to the nitrile and amine derivatives.The following is a typical example of a weight distribution of the monocarboxylic acids obtained under said conditions and, hence, of the amines prepared therefrom.degree of telomerization wt X m 1 78,0 m 2 6,3 m 3 6,5 m 4 4,0 m 5 3,1 6 3 6 2,0 It has been found that as far as the above mentioned field of application of corrosion inhibitors, surface active compounds etc., is con cerned, the use of mixtures of amines derived from those branched chain and straight chain carboxylic acids lead to compositions having unexpectedly favorable properties, which remarkably favorably compare with the known compositions, which only contain straight chain amines or the derivatives thereof.The commercially available ale fin fractions having 20 to 45 carbon atoms are found to contain 60 to 80 by weight of a olefins and for the rest predominantly consist of vinylidene compounds.The resulting amines are Y branched monoamines, with the amine having the formulaEMI9.1 where R1 and R2 represent linear alkyl groups which together have the same number of carbon atoms as the group R.Separation of these vinylidene groups containing fractions from the a olefins would give rise to so many technological problems that it must be considered impracticable for economic reasons.It has been found, however, that for most uses products having exceptionally good properties are obtained if besides the branched chain amines having the above formulae or the derivatives thereof there is present an amount of 40 to 60 per cent by weight of the amine fraction or of the derivatives thereof which consists of or is derived from linear aliphatic monoamines, with the amine having the formulaR CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2, where R represents a CH3 CH2 n group, with n being an integer of from 17 to 42.The invention is further described in, but not limited by the following examples.ExamDle IA slurry made up of 17,2 kg of manganese III acetate in 72,6 kg of acetic anhydride and was slowly added, with stirring, over a period of about 6 to 14 hours in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen, to a previously provided mixture of 208 kg 2 kg moles of acetic anhydride and 27,2 kg 0,86 kg moles of l octene. The reaction temperature was 1200C.When the manganese acetate addition was complete, the reaction mixture was cooled and filtered the reaction product and the filter cake were washed with hexane and the combined liquid phase recharged to the reactor for vacuum stripping. Hydrolysis of the resultant anhydride was accomplished with water acetic acid, which was finally stripped off under vacuum.The residual oil contained 38S capric acid, 2 volatiles, and the remainder was telomeric acid.Fractional vacuum distillation resulted in obtaining three fractions having the following chain length distribution given as wt. accord ing to a GPC analysis shown in Table I TABLE IEMI10.1 tb SEP ht SEP SEP Fraction tb SEP n SEP SEP A SEP SEP SEP A SEP B SEP C tb SEP 1 SEP 0,1 SEP 0,3 SEP 0,7 tb SEP 2 SEP 1,3 SEP 1,0 SEP 5,0 tb SEP 3 SEP 84,9 SEP 12,1 SEP 2,4 tb SEP 4 SEP 3,9 SEP 61,9 SEP 39,5 tb SEP 5 SEP 8,3 SEP 20,0 SEP 40,6 tb SEP 6 SEP 1,4 SEP 4,7 SEP 11,8 tb n degree of telomerizationThe telomeric acid fractions were converted into nitrile batchwise by bubbling ammonia gas through the hot 3250C acid containing 0,5 catalytic alumina and separating the evolved water via a Dean Stark trap.The reaction was continued until the conversion to nitrile was approximately 92S 15 to 20 hours . The nitrile was vacuum distilled yield 85 and subsequently hydrogenated.The hydrogenation to primary amine was carried out in a 2,8cm x 45,7cm continuous column containing a cobalt catalyst in the form of 0,44 cm extrudates.Hydrogenation was performed downflow at 1200C fraction C and 1450C fractions A and B , a pressure of 70 x 10 Pa, and a space velocity of 0,7 ml of nitrile 1 hr ml of bed space. The molar ratios of H2 NH3 nitrile were 21 27 1 fractions A and B 3 and 15 30 1 fraction C .

The reaction vessel was vented periodically to remove carbon dioxide and repressurized with methyl chloride. The reaction times varied from 4 to 8 hours.Example VI In this Example it will be shown that the branched chain telomeric amines of the present invention are suitable to be used in bitumen adhesion.The test procedure was as follows 1 g of the amine was added to 100 g cut back bitumen and thoroughly stirred to ensure proper dispersion.A metal container approximately 12,7 cm in diameter was covered with 15 20 g of said bitumen to a film thickness of about 1,5 mm.After cooling to 200C the container was immersed in water to a depth of about 2,54 cm. Into the bitumen film there were then lightly pressed 10 pieces of granite aggregate having a diameter of about 1,3 cm.The aggregate was then removed from the binder and the percentage of binder retained on the stone was visually assessed. Both fraction A ofExample I and fractions A and B of Example III resulted in 100 coverage.Example VII In this Example it is shown that the branched chain telomeric amines of the present invention are suitable to be incorporated into acid pickling inhibitor formulations.The test consists in storing weighed mild steel coupons in inhibited acid for 3 hours at 900C and subsequently determining the loss in weight. The test procedure was as follows The steel coupons were first degreased in boiling carbon tetrachloride for 5 10 minutes and subsequently in boiling acetone for another 5 10 minutes. Subsequently, they were allowed to cool in a desiccator and weighed. The coupon was then transferred to a bottle containing 200 ml of a hydrochloric acid pickling solution. The hydrochloric acid 15 w v contained a 1 solution of the test material. The temperature of the solution was then kept at 900C for 3 hours, after which the coupons were removed from the acid, washed thoroughly with water and placed in boiling acetone for 5 10 minutes. After cooling they were re weighed and the loss in weight was calculated.The results mentioned in the following table clearly show the superiority of the presently claimed amines to the commercially available straight chain ones. Product Weight loss by weightCommercial corrosion inhibitor containing a straight chain amine 0,25Same formulation based on an amine of Example i A 0,13 Example I C 0,20 Example III A 0,23 Example III B 0,17Example VISIT The same procedure was used in Example VII, except that the test was carried out now in sulphuric acid 10S by weight . The concentration of the inhibitor formulation was in this case 0,05S by weight.The loss in weight of the formulation based on a commercial straightchain amine was 0,40X by weight, whereas the loss in weight of the same formulation based on the amine of Example IV A was as low as 0,33 by weight.Example ix This Example shows the step wise preparation of a quaternary ammonium compound based on telomeric acid derived from hexene l.A. Preparation of Nitrile 650 9 of a telomeric acid, derived from hexene l, having an acid value of 160, a saponification value of 194 and a composition of 1,6 m 1 16 m 2 29 m 3 20 m 4 12 m 5 17 m , 6 and 3,5 g of cobalt II oxide were heated in a stainless steel autoclave at 3250C. Dry ammonia gas was continuously fed to the reactor. A pressure of 6 to 8 bar gauge was maintained by careful venting, removing at the same time the reaction water. After 7,5 hours the reaction was stopped. 79,8 g aqueous phase was collected from the vent line together with 36,2 g fatty acid material. 528 g reaction product remained in the autoclave. The reaction product was distilled at a pressure of 40,0 Pa 0.3 Torr and a top temperature of 1700C, yielding 76,3 w w distillate and 22,9 w w residue. The distillate contained 92,1 w w nitrile, 1,2 w w telomeric acid and 6,7 w w apparent soap and amide.B. Preparation of Primary Amine 120 g of this distillate, being the telomeric nitrile, derived from hexene l, was heated in a Hastelloy C autoclave together with 5,4 g 8133 Co catalyst Degussa and 12 g ammonia for 5 hours at 1800 200DC.

At the end of the reaction, the inorganic salt was filtered off and the isopropanol and water were evaporated at 2,7 kPa 20 Torr and 700C, yielding 112,2 g reaction product. Analysis of the product revealed that the quaternary ammonium chloride content was 1,86 meq g, corresponding with approx. 94S w w. From the composition of the starting amine, it can be calculated that this consists of 73 w w monotelomeric trimethyl ammonium chloride, 11S ditelomeric dimethyl ammonium chloride and 10 tritelomeric methyl ammonium chloride. Other analytical data 0,8 w w water, 0,1 w w free amine, 0,1 w w amine hydrochloric acid salt.The product appeared to be a liquid at room temperature. This liquidity in solvent free form is a remarkable advantage over e.g. stearyl trimethyl ammonium chloride which melts only over 2000C and must be diluted with alcohol water to get lower melting points.Example XThis Example shows the step wise preparation of quaternary ammonium compound based on telomeric acid derived from octene l.A.

At the end of the reaction th salts were filtered off and the isopropanol and water were distilled off at 2,7 kPa 20 Torr and 700C, yielding 111,4 g reaction product.Analysis of the product revealed that the quaternary ammonium chloride content was 1,51 meq g, corresponding with approximately 92 w w. From the composition of the starting amine it can be calculated that this consists of 4S w w monotelomeric trimethyl ammonium chloride, 80S w w ditelomeric dimethyl ammonium chloride and 8S w w tritelomeric methyl ammonium chloride.Other analytical data 0,1 w w free amine, 0,2X w w amine hydrochloric acid salt and 0,12 water.The product appeared to be liquid at room temperature. This liquidity is a remarkable advantage over distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, which melts at 1150C in pure form and at approximately 400C when diluted with 25 isopropanol water.Example XI This Example demonstrates the ability of the two quaternary ammonium compounds from Examples IX and X to demulsify oil in water emulsions.The quaternary ammonium compounds of the Examples are compared to a commercially available nonionic surfactant of the structure HO EO a PO b EO CH, wherein EO represents ethylene oxide linkages and PO represents propylene oxide linkages, sold under the trademarkDissolvan 4460 by Hoechst.Standary emulsions were prepared by mixing equal amounts 50 ml oil 50 ml water of oil from the forties field in the North Sea and water in an Ultra Turrax mixer for 20 minutes at maximum speed. The temperature of the emulsions during mixing was maintained at a maximum of 400C through ice cooling.Immediately after the emulsions were prepared, they were conditioned at 400C and 600C in 100 ml calibrated glass cylinders. Subsequently, the demulsifier to be tested was added in isopropanol at concentrations of 10, 25, 50 and 100 ppm, and the mixture homogenized by shaking manually.The amount of water removed was measured as a function of time and the demulsifications were performed at both 400C and 600 C. The results of the demulsifications are shown in the following Tables VI and VII and demonstrate that the quaternary ammonium compound of Examples IX and X both demulsify the oil water emulsion with the compound of Example IX being more effective than the compound of Example X, but less effective than the commercially available demulsifier Dissolvan 4460. The corresponding dimethyldicocoammonium chloride did not act as demulsifier.Table VI. Demulsification of Forties emulsions 50 ml oil, 50 ml water T 400 C.
