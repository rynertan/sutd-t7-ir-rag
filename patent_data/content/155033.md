# Liquid crystal display device.

## Abstract
A liquid crystal display device comprises two supporting plates 1, 2 which are kept spaced apart and the facing surfaces of which comprise a pattern of line electrodes and column electrodes, respectively, which form a matrix of display cells. A mixture of a nematic liquid crystal with a cholesteric addition is present between the supporting plates. The mixture has a positive dielectric anisotropy and a natural pitch p such that the ratio d p has a value between 0.6 and 0.9. The said surfaces comprise an orientation layer to provide a progressive molecular twist of the liquid crystal molecules director across the layer thickness d of greater than 1.2π and less than 1.7 π radians, the director assuming an angle of tilt between 0 and 7 at one surface and an angle of tilt between 5 and 70 at the other surface. Below a field strength E₁ the display cells are in a first stable state and above a field strength E₂ they are in a second state differing optically therefrom. At a field strength E
