# T Connection fiber optic repeater.

## Abstract
A T connection fiber optic repeater is used in a fiber optic network wherein the repeaters are connected by optical fibers to other repeaters and, the repeaters are also con nected to stars, in such a manner that an optical signal can move from repeater to repeater without having to traverse a star. Each repeater includes optical receivers for receiving optical signals from the adjacent repeaters and from a nearby star and optical transmitters for emitting optical signals to the adjacent repeaters and the nearby star. Since signal reflections from the nearby star arrive almost immedi ately after signals from the adjacent repeaters, an inhibit circuit is used to gate signals from the nearby star when signals are being received from either of the adjacent repeaters avoiding instability.
