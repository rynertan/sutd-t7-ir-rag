# Photoconductive device containing novel benzyl fluorinated squaraine compounds.

## Abstract
Disclosed are the use of novel squaraine compositions selected from the group consisting of bis 2 fluoro 4 methyl benzylaminophenyl squaraine, bis 2 fluoro 4 methyl p chlorobenzylaminophenyl squaraine, bis 2 fluoro 4 methyl p fluorobenzylaminophenyl squaraine, and bis 2 fluoro 4 methyl m chlorobenzylaminophenyl squaraine, in photore sponsive devices, particularly layered photoresponsive devices which are sensitive to infrared and or visible illu mination.
