# METHOD FOR REMOVAL OF ORGANOMETALLICS FROM WASTEWATER

## Abstract
Organometallic compounds, such as 10, 10 oxybisphenoxarsine, are removed from aqueous media by preferential absorption onto solid polyamide absorbants, such as nylon, preferably in the form of pellets, fibers, granules, film or coatings.
