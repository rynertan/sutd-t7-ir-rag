## Description
This invention relates to recombinant DNA molecules which comprise hepatitis B virus HBV DNA operatively linked to expression control sequences such that polypeptides which display HBV antigen specificity or antigenicity can be expressed. This invention also relates to host strains that are transformed with those recombinant HBV DNA molecules. This invention also relates to a process for producing a polypeptide displaying HBV antigen specificity or antigenicity comprising the step of culturing those transformed hosts. This invention also relates to polypeptides which display the HBV antigen specificity or antigenicity of a HBV core or a surface antigen produced by host strains transformed with those recombinant HBV DNA molecules. This invention further relates to a composition for stimulating the production of antibodies to HBV infection, and a means and a method for detecting HBV infection in blood serum, each characterized by the HBV core or surface antigen polypeptides of this invention. This invention also relates to DNA sequences coding for the HBV core and surface antigen polypeptides of this invention, and to a means for detecting HBV infections in blood serum characterized by those DNA sequences. The virus that causes hepatitis B or serum hepatitis appears to infect only man. Hepatitis B virus HBV infection in humans is widespread. In the United Kingdom, United States, and Western Europe, approximately 0.1 of all blood donors are chronic carriers of HBV. While the death rate due to viral hepatitis is not hign in 1975 in the United Kingdom it was 3 per million , there are indications that as many as 5 of the population in the United Kingdom and 15 of the population in the United States have been infected. In many African and Asian countries, up to twenty percent of the population are chronic carriers of HBV, and over fifty percent of all adults in those countries have been or are infected with HBV. The hepatitis infection is transmitted by three general mechanisms 1 by parenteral inoculation of infected blood or body fluids, either in large amounts as in blood transfusions or in minute amounts as through an accidental skinprick 2 by close family or sexual contact and 3 by some mothers, who infected during pregnancy, transmit the virus to their new born children. Under natural conditions. HBV is not highly contagious. Transmission by inhalation occurs rarely, if ever. Most HBV infections are subclinical. The clinical illness usually lasts three to six weeks and ranges in severity from mild to acute fulminating hepatitis followed by cirrhosis or deatn. Recovery from clinical and subclinical HBV infections is usually complete. However, serious long term consequences result in some cases Recent advances in molecular biology have made it possible to introduce the DNA coding for specific non bacterial eukaryotic proteins into bacterial cells. In general, with DNA other than that prepared via chemical synthesis, the construction of the recombinant DNA molecules comprises the steps of producing a single stranded DNA copy cDNA of a purified messenger mRNA template for the desired protein converting the cDNA to double stranded DNA linking the DNA to an appropriate site in an appropriate cloning vehicle and transforming an appropriate host with that recombinant DNA molecule. Such transformation permits the host to produce the desired protein. In addition, at least in the case of ovalbumin DNA, it is known that appropriate fusion of the particular DNA to a strong bacterial promoter or expression control sequence produces larger amounts of the desired ovalbumin protein. Several non bacterial proteins and genes have been synthesized using recombinant DNA technology. These include a protein displaying rat proinsulin antigenic determinants L. Villa Komaroff None of the foregoing, however, is directed, as is this invention, toward the recombinant DNA synthesis of viral proteins such as hepatitis B virus antigens. It is known that HBV infections cause development of antibodies to the antigens of the virus. These antibodies are the body s defense mechanism to the HBV infection. The development of such antibodies prior to exposure or rapidly in the case of potential exposure should substantially reduce and combat virus growth and spread in the patient. A problem however in the artificially stimulated development of antibodies to the antigens of hepatitis B virus is the limited host range of the virus. For example, although highly infectious to man, experimental infection with hepatitis B virus has been achieved in only a few additional primates. And, the virus has not been propagated in tissue culture. This limited host range and inability to infect tissue culture cells has severely hampered both the characterization of the virus and the pathology of its infection and the development of rapid detection means and effective means of infection control and prevention. While there have been some attempts to employ authentic HBV viral antigens, isolated from victims of the HBV infection, for the development of antibodies and detection of infection, these treatments are not generally available because of the limited supply of the active species. Furthermore, the use of human sources for these antigens is disfavored because of the well recognized contamination problems in using human isolates. The present invention solves the problems referred to by providing recombinant DNA molecules characterized by DNA sequences coding for polypeptides, or fragments thereof, displaying HBV antigen specificity, the DNA sequences being operatively linked to an expression control sequence in the recombinant DNA molecule and being expressed to produce a polypeptide displaying HBV antigen specificity when a suitable host cell transformed with the recombinant DNA molecule is cultured, the transformed host cell not producing any human serum proteins and any primate serum proteins other than the polypeptide displaying HBV antigen specificity. By virtue of our invention, it is possible to obtain polypeptides displaying HBV antigen specificity and DNA sequences coding therefor in substantial and uncontaminated quantities for vaccine preparations and for use in detection of the viral infection and determination of its pathology and molecular biology. The polypeptides made in accordance with this invention are advantageously free of any human serum proteins and any primate serum proteins. They may also display HBV antigenicity in addition to their HBV antigen specificity. Such polypeptides and DNA sequences have not hitherto been available, because of the narrow host range of the virus and its inability to be grown in tissue culture. As will be appreciated from the disclosure to follow, the recombinant DNA molecules of the invention are capable of producing, in suitable host cells, polypeptides, or fragments thereof, displaying HBV antigen specificity and the DNA sequences that code therefor. These polypeptides are advantageously free of any human serum proteins and any primate serum proteins. They may also display HBV antigenicity in addition to their HBV antigen specificity. These polypeptides and DNA sequences may also be identified and characterized and are useful either as produced in the host or after appropriate derivatization or modification in compositions and methods for improving production of these products themselves and for detecting HBV infection, tracing its pathology and stimulating the production of HBV antibodies in humans. Our process may be distinguished from the prior processes above mentioned in that none of the prior processes employs a natural gene or DNA for a particular protein for construction of the recombinant DNA molecule and production of that protein or gene. Instead, they employ either synthetic genes made by chemical synthesis or artificial genes made by enzymatically copying the mRNA isolated from the donor cell to produce cDNA sequences. One reason that natural DNA has not been previously employed directly in recombinant DNA synthesis of proteins is that natural DNA s from most higher organisms and at least some animal viruses contain introns or additional nucleotide sequences as part of the gene. These introns do not form part of the final message of the gene. Instead, they are removed Figure 1 is a simplified diagram representing the structure of the endogenous DNA of a Dane particle. It displays the two complementary DNA strands, strand a and b, the nick in strand a and the gap in strand b and the closing of that gap by DNA polymerase reaction. Figure 2 is a schematic outline of the preferred embodiment of the process of this invention fragments of the endogenous DNA isolated from the Dane particle are fused to the Figures 3 9 show the nucleotide sequence determined for a part of a hepatitis B virus genome in accordance with this invention. The sequence is displayed with the stop codons in the three reading frames noted above it. It is arbitrarily numbered from the initiation codon for the gene coding for HBcAg as determined in this invention. Nucleotides 80 to 1 represent the leader sequence which precedes this gene. Nucleotides 1 549 represent the nucleotide sequence for the gene coding for hepatitis B virus core antigen, the amino acid sequence reading frame 1 of this antigen being depicted above that sequence. Nucleotides 1437 2114 represent the nucleotide sequence determined for the gene of hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the amino acid sequence reading frame 3 of this antigen being depicted above that sequence. Various restriction endonuclease recognition sites in these genes are also depicted in Figures 3 9. Figure 10 is a schematic outline of a process of this invention wherein a recombinant DNA molecule which is capable of producing a polypeptide displaying the HBV antigen specificity of a hepatitis B virus core antigen is fragmented and a fragment therefrom attached to an improved expression control sequence, the Figure 11 is a schematic outline of a process of this invention wherein a recombinant DNA molecule of this invention is fragmented and connected to a fragment of phage DNA for use in lysogenizing host cells and thereby increasing the number of gene copies therein. Figure 12 is a schematic outline of another embodiment of the process of this invention a recombinant DNA molecule of this invention which does not produce a polypeptide displaying the HBV antigen specificity of a hepatitis B virus core antigen is fragmented to remove the structural gene for HBsAg and this structural gene employed to produce a recombinant DNA molecule which produces a polypeptide displaying the HBV antigen specificity of a hepatitis B virus surface antigen in a suitable host cell. In order that the invention herein described may be more fully understood, the following detailed description is set forth. In the description the following terms are employed Referring now to Figure 1, we have shown therein a simplified diagram of the endogenous DNA of a Dane particle. Dane particles are detectable in the blood plasma of some patients with hepatitis B viral infections D. S. Dane and C. H. Cameron, Virus Like particles In serum Of Patients With Australia Antigen Associated Hepatitis , The Dane particle s endogenous DNA has been isolated by extraction from the Dane particle. It consists of one nucleotide strand of constant length having a small nick or opening in it Figure 1, strand a, 3000 nucleotides and a second nucleotide strand of somewhat variable length Figure 1, strand b, 2000 nucleotides . The second strand is complementary with the first and overlaps its nick to complete a circular structure by hydrogen bonding between complementary bases in the standard Watson Crick manner. This overlap is apparent from Figure 1. The DNA polymerase of the Dane particle appears to use the second strand of the endogenous DNA as a primer and the first strand as a template to fill in the variable gap with nucleotides which are complementary to the nucleotides of the first strand and afford a double stranded DNA of about 3000 nucleotide pairs. Human serum from a single HBsAg positive, HBeAg positive donor serotype adyw was diluted with an equal volume of buffer 0.1 M tris HCI, 0.1 M saline NaCI , 0.1 weight volume as used throughout 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.1 bovine serum albumin, 0.001 M EDTA at pH 7.4. This was centrifuged at 35,000 r.p.m. for 2 hours at 4 C. The pellet thus obtained was resuspended in 200 µl of the same buffer and layered at the top of a centrifuge tube containing 20 sucrose. The suspension was centrifuged at 40,000 r.p.m. for 2 hours at 4 C. The pellet thus obtained was again resuspended in 100 µl of buffer 0.1 M tris HCl, 0.1 M saline at pH 7.5. The resultant DNA containing pellet was then labelled with ³H or ³²P as described by P. M. Kaplan The DNA was then extracted with phenol from the resulting pellet using the procedure of L. I. Lutwick and W. S. Robinson, DNA Synthesized In The Hepatitis B Dane Particle DNA Polymerase Reaction , A wide variety of host cloning vehicle combinations may be usefully employed in cloning the double stranded DNA isolated as above. For example, useful cloning vehicles may include chromosomal, non chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences such as various known bacterial plasmids such as pBR322, other Furthermore, within each specific vector, various sites may be selected for insertion of the isolated double stranded DNA. These sites are usually designated by the restriction enzyme or endonuclease that cuts them. For example, in pBR322 the The particular site chosen for insertion of the selected DNA fragment into the cloning vehicle to form a recombinant DNA molecule is determined by a variety of factors. These include size and structure of the polypeptide to be expressed, susceptibility of the desired polypeptide to endoenzymatic degradation by the host cell components and contamination by its proteins, expression characteristics such as the location of start and stop codons, and other factors recognized by those of skill in the art. Since the expression process is not fully understood, none of these factors alone absolutely controls the choice of insertion site for a particular polypeptide. Rather the site chosen effects a balance of these factors and not all sites may be equally effective for a given protein. Although several methods are known in the art for inserting foreign DNA into a cloning vehicle to form a recombinant DNA molecule, the method preferred in accordance with this invention is displayed in Figure 2. It is characterized by cleaving the Dane particle DNA with a restriction endonuclease, attaching polydeoxyC sequences to the 3 termini named by convention from the deoxyribose carbon of the DNA sugar backbone of the cleaved DNA and linking the elongated DNA to a cloning vehicle which has been cut at a particular site by a restriction endonuclease and elongated at the 3 termini of that cut with poly deoxyG sequences, that are complementary to the poly dC sequences of the cleaved DNA. The complementary character of the 3 tails of the DNA and cloning vehicle permit cohesion of those termini. To be useful in the process of this invention a restriction enzyme chosen to cleave the HBV DNA should not cleave the HBV DNA within an essential part of the gene that codes for polypeptides displaying HBV antigen specificity or within an essential part of the gene that codes for polypeptides displaying both HBV antigen specificity and HBV antigenicity and most suitably it should cleave the DNA at a limited number of sites. Restriction enzymes that have been employed in this invention include Of course, other known methods of inserting DNA sequences into cloning vehicles to form recombinant DNA molecules are equally useful in this invention. These include, for example, direct ligation wherein the same restriction endonuclease is employed to cleave the HBV DNA and the cloning vehicle. This procedure inherently provides complementary ends for cohesion. It should, of course, be understood that the nucleotide sequence or gene fragment inserted at the selected restriction site of the cloning vehicle may include nucleotides which are not part of the actual structural gene for the desired protein or may include only a fragment of that structural gene. It is only required that whatever DNA sequence is inserted, the transformed host will produce a polypeptide displaying HBV antigen specificity or a polypeptide displaying both HBV antigen specificity and HBV antigenicity. The recombinant DNA molecule containing the hybrid gene may be employed to transform a suitable host cell so as to permit that host transformant to express the structural gene or fragment thereof and to produce the polypeptide or portion thereof for which the hybrid DNA codes. The recombinant DNA molecule may also be employed to transform a suitable host cell so as to permit that host on replication to produce additional recombinant DNA molecules as a source of HBV structural genes and fragments thereof encoding polypeptides displaying HBV antigenicity or both HBV antigen specificity and HBV antigenicity. The selection of a suitable host cell for either of these uses is controlled by a number of factors recognized by the art. These include, for example, compatibility with the chosen vector, toxicity of the co products, ease of recovery of the desired polypeptide, expression characteristics, biosafety and costs. Again, since the mechanisms of expression are not fully understood, no absolute choice of host may be made for a particular recombinant DNA molecule or polypeptide from any of these factors alone. Instead, a balance of these factors must be struck with the realization that not all hosts may be equally effective for expression of a particular recombinant DNA molecule. In the present synthesis, the preferred cloning vehicle is the bacterial plasmid pBR322 and the preferred restriction endonuclease site therein is the In actual practice of the preferred embodiment of this invention, the DNA isolated as above from the Dane particles was digested with restriction endonuclease The plasmid pBR322 was digested with restriction endonuclease Equimolar amounts of the pBR322 poly dG and HBV DNA poly dC were then mixed together and the complementary sequences allowed to link by incubation in 100 mM NaCI, 50 mM tris HCI, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA TNE , 50 µl at 65 C for one hour, followed by 47 C for one hour, 37 C for one hour and 20 C for one hour and an equal volume of TNE and 20 µl of 100 mM MgCl₂, 100 mM CaC12, 100 mM tris HCI, pH 7.5 was added. Cultures of Bacterial colonies grown on the incubated tetracycline containing L agar plates were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin. The plasmid pBR322 includes the gene for ampicillin resistance. This gene is the proposed site of hybrid gene insertion. Therefore, colonies which have been transformed with a plasmid having DNA inserted at the chosen recognition site will be sensitive to ampicillin, but will retain their resistance to tetracycline Colonies that were resistant to tetracycline, sensitive to ampicillin and hybridized with authentic HBV DNA were tested for their ability to produce at least one polypeptide displaying HBV antigen specificity. Colonies were again picked onto Millipore filters supported on L agar plates containing tetracycline and incubated at 37 C overnight. A second plate of L agar was covered with a culture of Polypeptides displaying HBV antigen specificity or both HBV antigen specificity and HBV antigenicity and the structural genes and fragments which code therefor may be used in methods and kits designed to detect the presence of HBV antibodies in humans and therefore recognize humans and blood samples which have been infected by this virus. For example, the HBcAg produced by hosts transformed by recombinant DNA molecules of this invention can be used in the immunological diagnostic tests currently available for hepatitis B virus detection, that is radioimmunoassay or ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay . In one type of radioimmunoassay anti core antigen antibody, raised in a laboratory animal, is attached to a solid phase, for example, the inside of a test tube. HBcAg is then added to the tube so as to bind with the antibody. To the tube coated with the antigen antibody complex is added a sample of the patient s serum, together with a known amount of HBV anti core antibody labelled with a radioactive isotope such as radioactive iodine. Any HBV antibody in the patient s serum will compete with the labelled antibody for the free binding sites on antigen antibody complex. Once the serum has been allowed to interact, the excess liquid is removed, the test tube washed, and the amount of radioactivity measured. A positive result, To test the biological activity of the polypeptides displaying HBV antigenicity translated from the recombinant DNA molecule in the Immunodiffusion experiments, using the procedure described by O. Ouchterlony, Immunodiffusion and Immunoelectrophoresis , in As noted previously, restriction enzymes other than The HBV DNA fragments produced by the use of Instead of tailing the DNA fragments for cohesion, as described above, direct ligation of the gene fragments may be employed in the processes of this invention. For example, in two further preparations HBV DNA 20 ng was restricted with restriction endonuclease In the case of recombinant DNA molecules prepared via the Micro organisms prepared by the processes described herein are exemplified by cultures deposited in the Culture Collection of the Microbiologihal Research Establishment at Porton Down on December 15, 1978 and identified as pBR322 HBV A to F. Specifically, these cultures are characterized as follows Portions of these identical cultures have also been deposited in the Culture Collection of the National Collection of Industrial Bacteria, Aberdeen, Scotland on December 19, 1979. The above nomenclature for the cultures is a description of that culture as follows Host cloning vehicle restriction site in cloning vehicle with indication of elongation nucleotide if any hepatitis B virus restriction site in hepatitis B virus with indication of elongation if any resistance R or sensitivity S to tetracycline Tet and ampicillin Amp , positive hybridization to HBV DNA in the colony hybridization test, Of course, it is to be understood that the hybrid micro organisms, recombinant DNA molecules and polypeptides and methods applicable to them of this invention are not limited to those described in the preferred embodiment above. Instead, the hybrid organisms, recombinant DNA molecules and polypeptides may be modified during production or subsequently by known methods to good advantage. For example, more efficient expression control sequences may be utilized for transcription of the HBV genes or hybrid genes, mutations to reduce the synthesis of undesired gene products may be introduced, the protease levels in the host cells may be reduced, thermo inducible lysogens containing the HBV genes may be integrated into the host chromosome or other modifications and procedures may be carried out to increase the number of gene copies in the cell or to increase the cell s productivity in producing the desired polypeptides. Apart from their use to produce polypeptides displaying HBV antigen specificity or polypeptides displaying both HBV antigen specificity and HTV antigenicity, the hybrid micro organisms of this invention are also useful for the production of large quantities of DNA containing all or part of the genome for hepatitis B virus. For example, amplification, HBV DNA prepared in this way may be used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the genome and from that the gene and amino acid sequences of the HBV antigens and struhtural genes themselves. Knowledge of these sequences aids in understanding the biology of the hepatitis B virus and permits the modifications described above to be employed to best advantage. A series of recombinant DNA molecules, made in accordance with the processes described above, which imparted to their host cells the ability to synthesize HBcAg as detected by solid phase radioimmunoassay were chosen for sequence analysis. Fragments were prepared from these recombinant DNA molecules by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes and the fragments labelled at their 5 termini with α ³²P ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The nucleotide sequences of each fragment were then determined by well known chemical degradative methods A. M. Maxam and W. Gilbert, A New Method For Sequencing DNA , All of the recombinant DNA molecules examined had the HBV DNA inserted so that the core antigen gene was maintained in the same translational phase as the gene for penicillin resistance of pBR322. Moreover, in the various recombinants the HBV DNA insert began within one or two nucleotides of the same position in the HBV sequence. Because these recombinant DNA molecules originated from HBV DNA digested with various restriction enzymes, While it was expected that HBcAg or fragments thereof produced through expression of the HBV DNA inserts would be fused to the product β lactamase of the gene for penicillinase resistance via a small number of glycine residues, that was not the case. Instead, the β lactamase was in each case fused through 5 8 glycines to an identical peptide sequence, but this sequence terminated after 25 amino acids. In this reading frame Frame 1, Figure 3 , a stop codon TAG is followed three nucleotides later by an initiation codon from which translation continues unhindered to give a polypeptide 183 amino acids in length Figures 3 8 . Therefore, core antigenic activity resides in a polypeptide of about 21,000 daltons translated The nucleotide sequence of the gene for HBsAg and the amino acid sequence for the polypeptide deduced from this gene Reading Frame 3 is also depicted in Figures 6 8, between nucleotides 1437 2114. The amino acid sequence of this polypeptide begins at the N terminus with the sequence met glu asn ile thr ser. This initial amino acid sequence was determined by D. L. The HBsAg amino acid sequence and length has been independently confirmed by sequencing appropriate recombinant DNA molecules by P. Valenzuela The nucleotide sequence determined for the recombinant DNA molecules of this invention shows that none of those examined which expressed the gene for HBcAg can have the gene for HBsAg in a position from which it could also be expected to be expressed in an appropriate host cell. In fact, no HBsAg was detected in the extracts of cells transformed with those plasmids found to express the gene for HBcAg. However, as noted, The gene and amino acid sequences of these HBV antigens are useful in designing methods to increase the level of production of antigen or gene per bacterial cell. The level of production of a protein is governed by two major factors the number of copies of its gene within the cell and the efficiency with which these gene copies are transcribed and translated. Efficiency of transcription and translation which together comprise expression is in turn dependent upon nucleotide sequences, normally situated ahead of the desired coding sequence. These nucleotide sequences or expression control sequences define, For illustrative purposes, the sequence determined for the gene of HBcAg has been employed in this way to improve the production of HBcAg in Inspection of the DNA sequence for HBcAg in Figure 3 reveals that this gene is preceded by a target for To shorten even further the distance between the particular expression control sequence and the initiation codon of the chosen gene fragment, the particular fragment may be treated lightly with a combination of nucleases acting specifically at or near its terminus or used in exonuclease and polymerase linked repair reactions to remove some or all of those nucleotides of the fragment preceding the fragment s start codon. Alternatively, a fragment, such as an Several expression control sequences may be employed as described above. These include the operator, promoter and ribosome binding and interaction sequences including sequences such as the Shine Dalgarno sequences of the lactose operon of The fusion product is then inserted as before into a cloning vehicle for transformation of the appropriate hosts and the level of antigen production measured by radioimmunoassay after lysis of the cells. Cells giving the most efficient expression may be thus selected. Alternatively, cloning vehicles carrying the While these experiments have related to the production of HBV core antigen specifically, they are applicable to the improvement of the expression of other genes such as HBsAg and HBeAg genes and fragments thereof. Further increases in the cellular yield of these particular antigens depend upon an increase in the number of genes that can be utilized in the cell. This has been achieved for illustration purposes by insertion of recombinant DNA molecules engineered in the way described previously into the temperate bacteriophage λ NM989 , most simply by digestion of the plasmid with a restriction enzyme, Particularly useful λ cloning vehicles contain a temperature sensitive mutation in the repression gene In addition to the E. The gene and amino acid sequences determined for HBsAg are useful in designing methods to permit expression of the gene for HBsAg by the process of this invention. Such expression was not previously observed in suitable host cells transformed with recombinant DNA molecules that produced polypeptides displaying HBV antigen specificity or both HBV antigen specificity and HBV antigenicity. The nucleotide sequence of Figures 6 8 displays the gene coding for HBsAg between nucleotides 1437 and 2114. This gene is in a different translational phase Reading Frame 3 than the gene coding for HBcAg Reading Frame 1 in the HBV genome of Figures 3 9. Therefore, a recombinant DNA molecule that did not produce HBcAg when used to transform a suitable host cell, but contained an HBV DNA insert of about 2350 nucleotides corresponding to about nucleotides 80 to 2270 of the sequence of Figures 3 8 was chosen for use in HBsAg production. The selected recombinant DNA molecule contained, Fragments of HBV DNA derived from such digests have been treated in a series of reactions analogous to those described for the gene and gene fragments coding for core antigen. For example, the gene fragment may be inserted into the gene coding for penicillin resistance of pBR322 For illustration purposes, one such scheme is depicted in Figure 12. There, the selected recombinant DNA molecule having an HBV DNA insert extending between about nucleotides 80 and 2270 Figures 3 8 was fragmented by digestion with Other fragments In addition, such gene fragments have been inserted in pBR322 which had been cleaved by The nucleotide sequence between nucleotides 948 and 1437, immediately preceding the structural gene coding for HBsAg, may also be included in the fragments employed to produce useful recombinant DNA molecules for production of polypeptides displaying HBsAg antigen specificity or both HBsAg antigen specificity and HBsAg antigenicity and gene fragments of the structural gene for HBsAg. This nucleotide sequence is referred to as the precursor sequence of the gene. Gene fragments including both this precursor sequence and the structural gene for HBsAg may be excised with While we have hereinbefore presented a number of embodiments of this invention, it is apparent that our basic construction can be altered to provide other embodiments which utilize the process of this Invention. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the scope of this invention is to be defined by the claims appended hereto rather than the specific embodiments which have been presented hereinbefore by way of example. Micro organisms prepared by the processes described herein are exemplified by cultures deposited in the Culture Collection of the National Collection of Industrial Bacteria, Aberdeen, Scotland on December 20, 1979 and identified as pBR322 HBV G L and characterized as follows
