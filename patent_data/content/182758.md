# Level sensor.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an electric level sensor for de tecting the liquid level in a tank. The sensor is designed as a hollow body 1 suspended in an electric cable 2 connected to an electric switch 3 within the hollow body 1 . The connection is so spring loaded that the switch 3 takes different positions depending on if the sensor is surrounded by liquid or air.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A level sensor for disconnection connection of an electric function, for instance the motor in a pump, which gives a signal in dependance of the liquid level, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in, that the sensor, having the shape of a hollow body 1 is suspended in an electric cable 2 , which is connected to a spring loaded electric switch 3 within the hollow body in such a way that the latter is suspended in the switch 3 attached to the wall of the hollow body 1 , the weight volume relation of the hollow body 1 in air and liquid resp and the curing force of the switch 3 are so dimensioned, that t ie latter takes a disconnected closed position when the sensor is surrounded by air and a closed disconnected position when the sensor is entirely or partly surrounded by liquid. 2. A level sensor according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in, that the switch 3 is influenced by a plunge 4 acted upon by a spring loaded lever 6 to disconnected closed position.

## Description
A LEVEL SENSORThis invention concerns an electric level sensor for detecting the liquid level in a tank and depending on that level giving a signal to a unit for control of different functions. Particularly the invention is meant to be used in sewage water pump stations for starting stopping pumps, initiating alarm etc.Level sensors for this purpose are previously known and which have the form of an independantly suspended water tight hollow body which has its weight so distributed that the body takes different angles of inclination with reference to the vertical lie depending on if it is surrounded by a liquid or air. A mercury switch within the body is then arranged to close disconnect an electric circuit in dependance of the inclination. Such a level sensor is described in the US patent No 3183 323.A disadvantage with the level sensors described above is that the sensor is relatively expensive to manufacture and that mercury for environment reasons may not be allowed in many applications. Pollutions in the liquid may also be collected on the sensor in such a way that its inclination can be influenced, thus obtaining a wrong function.According to the invention the problem to manufacture a reliable level sensor, mainly used in sewage pump stations is solved, by help of the device stated in the claims.The invention is described more closely below with reference to the enclosed drawings.In the drawing 1 stand for a hollow body, 2 an electric cable, 3 an electric switch having a contact plunge 4, 5 a lever, 6 a spring and 7 an intermediate bridge.The hollow body 1 is suspended in the electric cable 2, the lead in being water tight and resiliant so that the cable may be moved a short distance in its axial direction within the lead in.The cable 2 ends within the body 1 with a connection to the switch 3 which is mounted on the bridge 7. The cable is urged by the spring 6 in the direction away from the switch 3.The spring force is so adapted with reference to the weight of the body, that the lever takes two distinct positions when the body is surrounded by a liquid and air resp.In the drawing the sensor is shown surrounded by air.Here the gravity is so strong that the spring is compressed and the plunge 4 urged inwards, thus disconnecting the circuit in the switch. This indicates that the liquid level is below the sensor.If on the other hand the body 1 is surrounded by liquid, the gravity decreases thus giving the lever a maximum elevation and letting the plunge 4 leave its inner position obtaining a closure of the switch. Here is indicated that the liquid level is on a level with or above the sensor. By a suitable adaption of the weight of the body and the spring force with reference to the viscosity of the liquid, it is possible to obtain two very distinctive positions which indicate the liquid level. The signals received can for instance be used for starting stopping an electrically driven pump.In the discription above the designations t closed and disconnected resp for the switch 3 are used when the liquid level is above and below the sensor resp. It is however obvious that the switch could be so designed that a closed position means a liquid level below the sensor and that a disconnected position means a liquid level above the sensor.
