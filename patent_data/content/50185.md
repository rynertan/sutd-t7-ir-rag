# Apparatus for the rapid continuous corona poling of polymeric films.

## Abstract
Polymeric films exhibiting piezoelectric properties have such properties enhanced by being subjected to improved poling apparatus of the present invention comprising a textured corona discharge electrode roller oscillating over the polymeric film, preferably polyviny lidene fluoride, while the film is simultaneously slowly transported on a rotating drum. The electrode continuously discharges corona through the film while sweeping back and forth thereover. Comparatively low voltages are employed and dielectric breakdown of the film is substantially non existent. A protective reuseable co film is preferably interposed between the oscillating electrode and film to be poled.
