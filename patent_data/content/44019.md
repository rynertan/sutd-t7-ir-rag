# Safety device for medical treatment system.

## Abstract
A medical treatment system provided with a safety device which prevents laser beams from being unnecessarily projected on a normal coeliac tissue around an affected coeliac region 98 requiring medical treatment from a laser knife apparatus 34 . Where the operator 42 approaches an eyepiece 6 at a prescribed distance, then the safety device removes a mirror 60 from a path of laser beams, enabling laser beams to be brought into a laser knife probe 16 when a foot switch 58 is closed. An infrared ray detector 44 is provided in the eyepiece 6 . Where the operator 42 approaches the eyepiece 6 at a prescribed distance, then an output signal from the infrared ray detector 44 has a prescribed level. As a result, a solenoid controller 56 is actuated to energize a solenoid 54 . Consequently, the mirror 60 is removed from a path of laser beams by the energized solenoid 54 . Unless the operator 42 approaches the eyepiece 6 , the mirror 60 remains in the path of laser beams, thereby preventing laser beams from being brought into a laser knife probe 62 .
