# Nodal switching network with binary order links.

## Abstract
A nodal switching network is disclosed wherein each node is connected to distant nodes by groups of links whose lengths are ordered to span distances definable by powers of a finite preferably binary integer. Starting at the calling node, a single idle link in a preferred coordinate direction is attempted to be seized to extend the connection as far as possible by a direct path. If a direct path link spanning the most of the distance in the preferred coordinate direction cannot be seized, a direct path link is attempted to be seized in another coordinate direction. If no link which would extend the connection most efficiently in either coordinate direction can be seized, links of less direct length in the coordinate directions are tested. If the call is still blocked, the procedure is repeated in the direction from the called node toward the calling node.
