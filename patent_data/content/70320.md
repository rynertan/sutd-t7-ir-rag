# SEALING AND MOLDING MACHINE.

## Abstract
A sealing and molding machine used for sealing and molding small electric elements on synthetic resin. This machine can shorten the cycle time of the sealing and molding steps, reduce the facility cost required for molding dies, molding press, etc., and decrease losses of the syn thetic resin material. When the small electric elements are sealed and molded in the synthetic resin material, pots 30 are provided to rapidly load the synthetic resin material at equal distances for a plurality of cavities forming the sealing and molding resin section arranged in molds 11 , 12 , and the sealing and molding is done by plungers 31 at every pot. This sealing and molding machine can be used as a resin sealing unit for semiconductor devices or the like.
