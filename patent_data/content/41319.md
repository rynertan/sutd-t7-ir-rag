# Document scanner.

## Abstract
A scanner for scanning a document 10 positioned against a backing surface 14 to determine the position of the document includes photoelectric transducers 24, 26, 28 which provide electrical scan signals in dependence upon the light reflected from the document and from the backing sur face at a plurality of moving scan positions 44 as the scan positions move across both the document and the backing surface. A recognizable background image 42 is defined on the document backing surface such that the photoelectric transducers 24, 26, 28 provide a recognizable pattern of scan signals as the document backing surface is scanned, thereby indicating the position of the document. The recognizable background pattern may include a plurality of stripes 42 which extend substantially perpendicular to the direction of movement of the scan positions. Alternate ones of the stripes may be black with intermediate ones of the stripes being white.
