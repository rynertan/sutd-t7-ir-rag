# Peristaltic pump.

## Abstract
To permit two different fluent media to be pumped independently of each other in one and the same peristaltic pump, a single reversible motor 3 is connected to at least two rotors 7,8 respectively passing over an associated separate resiliently compressible tube 12, 13, a first of said rotors 7, being effective to compress its associated tube 12 only when the motor 3 is turning in one direction 34 and a second of said rotors 8 being effected to compress its associated tube 13 only when the motor 3 is turning in the opposite direction.
