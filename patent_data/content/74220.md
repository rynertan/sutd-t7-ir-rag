# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO INSERTS FOR SILENCERS

## Abstract
An insert for use in an internal combustion engine silencer consisting of a central cylindrical former, an outer portion surrounding the former formed of a fibrous material in which the fibres are heat resistant such as basalt fibres, and an outer covering of sheet or scrim material for retaining the fibrous material of the outer portion in position relatively to the former. The insert is formed by inserting a length of the fibrous material loosely around the former placing the fibrous material and former into a loop of an endless belt, applying tension thereto and rotating the endless belt to roll the fibrous material around the former and an outer covering of sheet or scrim material is wrapped around the rolled insert to retain the shape thereof.
