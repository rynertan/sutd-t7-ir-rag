# CONTROLLING ENGINE EXHAUST GAS RECIRCULATION AND VACUUM INVERTER

## Abstract
Engine manifold vacuum is inverted by an in line vacuum inverter which provides a power source for an EGR valve actuator for providing desired EGR flow in a predeter mined range of engine power loading and EGR flow is cut off outside the range. The invention utilizes a vacuum in verter employing a pair of spaced diaphragms for control ling an atmospheric air bleed valve to a vacuum chamber powered by manifold vacuum. The diaphragms are spring loaded so as to seek equilibrium positions as vacuum in the chamber varies force. The inverter produces a vacuum output signal which changes inversely with changes in engine manifold vacuum.
