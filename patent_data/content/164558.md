# Control device for controlling air fuel ration and spark timing of an integral combustion engine.

## Abstract
A control device determining the air fuel ratio in the lean est fashion or in the leaner fashion depending on the position of the throttle valve. The ignition timing is also determined in relation to the air fuel ratio. The ignition timing is advanced when the air fuel ratio is in the leanest fashion and the ig nition timing is retarded with respect to the former timing when the air fuel ratio is in the leaner fashion. The control device further causes a delay in change over of the ignition timing between two timing patterns relative to the change over of the air fuel ratio when the opening of the throttle valve is changed beyond the predetermined value.
