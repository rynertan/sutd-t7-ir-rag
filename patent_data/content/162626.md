# Record material carrying a colour developer composition.

## Abstract
Record material carrying a colour developer composition for use in pressure sensitive record sets comprises an ad dition product of phenol and a diolefinic alkylated or alkenyl ated cyclic hydrocarbon. The addition product has a minimum hydroxyl number, as determined for non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups only by Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy, in the range of 120 to 140.
