# Process for desulfurizing fuel gases.

## Abstract
A fuel gas, at superatmospheric pressure, containing CO₂ and H₂S contaminants is desulfurized. The process comprises absorbing the contaminants in a solvent absorbent forming a substantially more pure fuel gas, desorbing the contaminants from the absorbent as a new gas stream, passing the desorbed contaminants, while at superatmospheric pressure, to a liquid phase Claus reactor 17 to react the dilute H₂S with SO₂ in the liquid media forming sulfur, incinerating unreacted H₂S contained in the Claus tail gas to SO₂, absorbing the SO₂ in an aqueous absorbent and recycling the SO₂ rich absorbent thus produced to the Claus reactor 17 .
