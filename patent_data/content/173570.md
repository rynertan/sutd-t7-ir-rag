## Description
Shift Register Circuit The present invention relates to a shift register circuit used for data processing apparatus. Previously, for example, a four bit bi directional shift register is constructed by connecting together four elementary circuits for storing 1 bit of data each. For example, an elementary circuit for such a shift register consists of five three input NAND gates, one four inputNAND gate, two two input AND gates and one two input NOR gate. The whole shift register includes only one NOT gate for common use. In such a prior art elementary circuit for a shift register, eight gates, in terms of NAND gates, are used per bit, and, in addition the common element. In the above elementary circuit for a shift register, in the normal state, 2 to 4 gates per bit are in the ON state to deliver a LOW potential output. This shows that 2 to 4 gates per bit are in the current passing state and this requires a large power consumption. In such an elementary circuit for a shift register, it is necessary to provide five control lines for transmitting a SET barred SET signal, a RESET barredRESET signal, a RIGHT SHIFT signal, a LEFT SHIFT signal, and a CLOCK signal for each elementary circuit, where each of the SET and RESET signals are significant when the potential of the signal is LOW. The prior art shift register has a disadvantage in that a large number of logic gates are used, and that this large number of logic gates is made ON, thus requiring a large power consumption where transistortransistor logic TTL circuits are used for the logic gates, and that a large number of control lines must be used. According to a first aspect of this invention an elementary circuit for holding one data bit in a shift register circuit comprises four gates connected in sequence, each of the gates having a first input terminal for receiving an output signal of the succeeding gate, a second input terminal for receiving an output signal of the preceding gate, and a third input terminal for receiving predetermined control signals, the outputs of second and third gates forming outputs of the elementary circuit for one bit of the shift register, and, a first, a second, a third, and a fourth control signal being applied to the third input terminals respectively of the first to fourth gates. According to a second aspect of this invention a shift register circuit comprises a plurality of elementary shift register circuits connected in sequence, ea of the elementary shift register circuits comprises a first, a second, a third, and a fourth logic gate, the output of the second logic gate being connected to a first input terminal of the first logic gate, a right shifted signal from a preceding elementary shift register circuit being supplied to the second input terminal of the first logic gate, the output of the third logic gate being connected to a first input terminal of the second logic gate, the output of the first logic gate being connected to a second input terminal of the second logic gate, the output of the fourth logic gate being connected to a first input terminal of the third logic gate, the output of the second logic gate being connected to a second input terminal of the third logic gate, a left shifted signal from a succeeding elementary shift register circuit being supplied to a first input terminal of the fourth logic gate, the output of the third logic gate being connected to the second input terminal of the fourth logic gate, digital signals having predetermined polarity, predetermined duration, and predetermined timing with respect to a sequential order being supplied to the third input terminals of each of the first to fourth logic gates, the output of the first logic gate being supplied to the preceding elementary shift register circuit as a left shifted signal, the output of the fourth logic gate being supplied to the succeeding elementary shift register circuit as a right shifted signal, and the output of the second logic gate forming a positive output and the output of the third logic gate forming a negative output of the elementary shift register circuit. The present invention provides an improved shift register in which the number of constituent logic gates per bit is smaller, and accordingly, the power consumption is smaller, and further, there are less control lines.

Before starting the description of the embodiments of the present invention, a prior art elementary shift register circuit will be described with reference toFigure I. A 4 bit bidirectional shift register is constituted by four elementary shift register circuits 8 fo storing 1 bit data. The elementary shift register circuit 8 consists of five 3 input NAND gates 801, 802, 803, 804, and 805, one 4 input NAND gate 806, two 2 input AND gates 807 and 808, and one 2 input NOR gate 809. Only one NOT gate 810 in common is sufficient for the shift register. As shown inFigure 1, eight gates, in terms of NAND gates, are used per bit except for the common element. An elementary shift register circuit for a shift register circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 2. The shift register circuit using the elementary shift register circuit shown in Figure 2 is shown in Figure 3. In Figure 2, the elementary shift register circuit 2 consists of four 3 input NAND gates 21, 22, 23, and 24.The preceding elementary shift register circuit 1 is provided to the left of the elementary shift register circuit 2. The succeeding elementary shift register circuit 3 is provided to the right of the elementary shift register circuit 2. A right shift signal from the preceding elementary shift register circuit 1 is supplied to the second input terminal of the NAND gate 21. The output of the NAND gate 22 is supplied to the first input of the NAND gate 21. A control clock signal CONT A from the control clock signal circuit is supplied to the third input terminal of the NAND gate 21. The output of the NAND gate 21 is supplied to the second input terminal of the NAND gate 22. The output of the NAND gate 23 is supplied to the first input terminal of the NAND gate 22. A control clock signal CONT B from the control clock signal circuit is supplied to the third input terminal of the NAND gate 22. The output of the NAND gate 22 is supplied to the second input terminal of the NAND gate 23. The output of the NAND gate 24 is supplied to the first input terminal of the NAND gate 23. A control clock signal CONT C from the control clock signal circuit is supplied to the third input terminal of the NAND gate 23. The output of the NAND gate 23 is supplied to the second input terminal of the NAND gate 24. A left shift signal from the succeeding elementary shift register circuit 3 is supplied to the first input terminal of theNAND gate 24. A control clock signal CONT D from the control clock signal circuit is supplied to the third input terminal of the NAND gate 24. The positive output Q of the elementary shift register circuit 2 is delivered from the output terminal of the NAND gate 22. The negative output Q barred Q of the elementary shift register circuit 2 is delivered from the output terminal of the NAND gate 23. The control clock signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , and CONT D from the control clock signal circuit are supplied to each third input terminal of the NAND gates 21, 22, 23, and 24. The basic operation of the elementary shift register circuit shown in Fig. 2 will be described below. In the stable state, the potentials of the control clock signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , and CONT D areLOW, HIGH, HIGH, and LOW, respectively. Therefore, the potentials of the outputs of the NAND gates 21 and 24 are HIGH so that only the NAND gates 22 and 23 are active to form a latch circuit. Since the output of the gate 22 is supplied to an input terminal of the gate 23 and the output of the gate 23 is supplied to an input terminal of the gate 22, the two NAND gates 22 and 23 form a latch circuit which holds Q and Q signals at the output terminals of the gates 22 and 23. The gate 21 is the left hand side gate, and the gate 24 is the right hand side gate. In the basic right shift operation, the output signals Q, Q of the gates 22 and 23 are shifted to the output signals Q, Q of the gates 23 and 24. First, the potentials of the control clock signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , and CONT D becomeLOW, HIGH, HIGH, and HIGH. Since the potential of the control clock signal CONT A is LOW, the potential of the first input of the gate 24 is HIGH. Hence, the output signal Q of the gate 23 is inverted by the gate 24 to produce the output signal Q as the output of the gate 24. Second, the potentials of the control signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , and CONT D becomeLOW, LOW, HIGH, and HIGH. The potential of the output of the gate 22 becomes HIGH so that the gates 23 and 24 form a latch circuit which holds the signals Q, Q at the output terminals of the gates 23 and 24. In this condition, it seems that the stable state is shifted in one gate. The basic left shift operation can be explained in a manner similar to the above described basic right shift operation. The operation of the elementary shift register circuits 1, 2, and 3 shown in Fig. 3 will be described below in the case of a right shift operation, focusing on the signals Q and Q in the elementary shift register circuit 2, which are shifted to the elementary shift register circuit 3. 1 First, the potentials of the control clock signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C and CONT D are LOW,HIGH, HIGH, and LOW, and the elementary shift register circuits 1, 2, and 3 are in the stable state. To the first input terminal of the NAND gate 24, the HIGH potential of the left shift signal is applied. To the second input terminal of the NAND gate 24, the signal Q is applied. 2 When the potential of the control signalCONT D becomes HIGH, the right shift signal from theNAND gate 24 represents the inverted signal of the signal Q i.e., Q. 3 When the potential of the control signal CONT B becomes LOW, the potential of the output Q of the NAND gates 22 and 32 becomes HIGH. 4 When the potential of the control signalCONT A becomes HIGH, the output of the NAND gate 31 represents the inverted signal of the right shift signal applied to the second input terminal of the NAND gate 31, since the potential of the signal Q applied to the first gate of the NAND gate 31 is HIGH. Since the potential of the signal Q in the elementary shift register circuit 2 is transmitted to the second input terminal of the NAND gate 31, the left shift signal delivered from the output terminal of the NAND gate 31 represents the inverted signal of the Q signal in the elementary shift register circuit 2, that is, the signal Q in the preceding elementary shift register circuit 2. 5 When the potential of the control signalCONT C becomes LOW, the potential of the output signal Q of the NAND gate 33 becomes HIGH. 6 When the potential of the control signalCONT B is restored to HIGH, the output signal of theNAND gate 32 represents the inverted signal of the output signal Q of the NAND gate 31, that is, the signal Q. 7 When the potential of the control signalCONT D is restored to LOW, the potential of the rightshift signal delivered from the NAND gate 24 becomesHIGH 8 When the potential of the control signal CONT C is restored to HIGH, the output of the NAND gate 23 represents the inverted signal of the output signal Q of the NAND gate 32, that is, the signal Q. 9 When the potential of the control signal CGNTfA is restored to LOW, the potential of the leftshift signal delivered from the output terminal of theNAND gate 31 becomes HIGH. This state is again the stable state. A process of the right shift operation is thus carried out through the above indicated steps 1 to time By this right shift operation, the output signals Q and Q of the preceding elementary shift register circuit 2 is transferred to the output signals Q and Q of the present elementary shift register circuit 3. The potentials of the other signals and the outputs of the logic gates are restored to the state prevailing before this right shift operation. The sequence of changes of the potentials of the control signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , and CONT D are illustrated in Fig. 4. The changes with time of the potentials of the signals in the elementary shift register circuit 3 shown in Fig. 2, in the above described right shift operation, are illustrated in Fig. 5. Figure 5 shows the waveforms of the control signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , and CONT D , the left shift signal, the signal Q, the signal Q, and the right shift signal In Fig. 5, ta is the time length necessary for the operation of each of the logic gates, and the indication H L represents the possibility of either a HIGH potential or LOW potential. The operation of the elementary shift register circuit 1, 2, and 3 shown in Fig. 3 will now be described in the case of a left shitt operation, focusing on the signal Q, Q in the elementary shift register circuit 2 which are transmitted to the shift register circuit 1. In the left shift operation, the control clock signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , and CONT D are changed according to the sequence from No. 8 to No. 1 ofFig. 4, because of the symmetrical structure of the circuit. 1 First, in the stable state, the potentials of the control clock signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , andCONT D are LOW, HIGH, HIGH, and LOW. To the second input terminal of the NAND gates 11 and 21, the HIGH potential of the right shift signal is applied. 2 When the potential of the control signalCONT A becomes HIGH, the left shift signal from theNAND gate 21 represents the inverted signal of the output signal Q of the gate 22 i.e., Q. 3 When the potential of the control signalCONT C becomes LOW, the potential of the output Q of the NAND gate 13 becomes HIGH. 4 When the potential of the control signalCONT D becomes HIGH, the output terminal of the NAND gate 14 represents the inverted signal of the left shift signal trom the output terminal of the gate 21 in the elementary shift register circuit 2, i.e., Q, since the potential of the output signal Q of the gate 13 isHIGH. 5 When the potential of the control signalCONT B becomes LOW, the potential of the output Q of the NAND gate 12 becomes HIGH. 6 When the potential of the control signal CONT C becomes HIGH, the signal Q delivered from the output terminal of the NAND gate 23 represents the inverted signal of the right shift signal from theNAND gate 14, i.e., Q, since the potential of the second input signal Q of the gate 12 is HIGH. 7 When the potential of the control signal CONT A becomes LOW, the potential of the output terminal of the NAND gate 11 becomes HIGH. 8 When the potential of the control signal CONT B becomes HIGH, the signal Q delivered from the NAND gate 12 represents the inverted signal of the output signal Q ot the gate 13, i.e., Q, since the potential of the output terminal of the NAND gate 11 isHIGH. 9 When the potential of the control signal CONr D becomes LOW, the potential of the right shift signal delivered from the NAND gate 14 becomes HIGH.This state is again the stable state. The process of the lett shift operation is carried out through the above indicated steps I to 9 . By this left shift operation, the output signals Q and Q of the elementary shift register circuit 2 are transferred to the output signals Q and Q of the elementary shift register circuit 1. The potentials of the other signals and the outputs of the logic gates are restored to the state prevailing before this left shift operation The changes with time of the potentials of the signals in the elementary shift register circuit 1 shown in Fig. 2, in the above described left shift operation, are illustrated in Fig. 6, in the manner similar toFig. 5. The operation of the elementary shift register circuit 2 shown in Fig. 2 will now be described in the case of the setting operation.By the setting operation the potential of the signal Q is made HIGH, and the potential ot the signal Q is made LOW. 1 In the stable state, the potentials of the control clock signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , andCONT D are LOW, HIGH, HIGH, and LOW. When the potential of the control signal CONT B becomes LOW, the potential of the signal Q delivered trom the NAND gate 22 becomesHIGH. 2 In the stable state, the potential of the right shift signal supplied to the first input terminal of the NAND gate 23 is HIGH, and the potential of the control signal CONT C supplied to the third input terminal of the NAND gate 23 is HIGH. According to the operation indicated in 1 , above, the potential of the signal Q supplied to the second input terminal of the NAND gate 23 becomes HIGH so that the potential of the signal Q delivered from the NAND gate becomes LOW. 3 The potential of the control signal CONT B is restored to HIGH so that the shift register returns to the stable state. The process of the setting operation is carried out through the above indicated steps 1 to 3 . The changes with time of the potentials of the signals in the elementary shift register circuit 2 shown in Fig. 2, in the above described setting operation, are illustrated in Fig. 7. The operation of the elementary shift register circuit 2 shown in Fig. 2 will now be described in the case of the resetting operation. By the resetting operation the potential of the signal Q is made LOW, and the potential of the signal Q is made HIGH. 1 In the stable state, the potentials of the control clock signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , andCONT D are LOW, HIGH, HIGH, and LOW. When the potential of the control signal CONT C becomes LOW, the signal Q delivered from the NAND gate 23 becomes HIGH. 2 In the stable state, the potential of the left shift signal supplied to the second input terminal of the NAND gate 22 is HIGH, and the potential of the control signal CONT B supplied to the third input terminal of the NAND gate 22 is HIGH. According to the operation indicated in 1 , above, the potential of the signal Q becomes HIGH so that the potential of the signal Q delivered from theNAND gate becomes LOW. 3 The potential of the control signal CONT C is restored to HIGH, so that the shift register returns to the stable state. By these steps 1 to 3 , the resetting operation is carried out. The changes with time of the potentials of the signals in the elementary shift register circuit 2 shown in Fig. 2, in the above described resetting operation, are illustrated in Fig. 8. An example of the control clock signal generation circuit is shown in Fig. 9.

The operation of the control clock signal generation circuit 5 shown in Fig. 9 will be described with reference to the waveforms shown in Figs. 10 to 13. The case in which the SET barred SET signal is appLied to the control clock signal generation circuit is illustrated in Fig. 10. As shown in Fig. 10, since the potential of the clock signal CLK is LOW, the potentials of the signals S 508 and 5 509 are HIGH.Since the potential of the right shift left shift signal is HIGH, the potential of the control signal CONT B becomes LOW, through the AND gate 512 and the OR gate 519, corresponding to the period of the LOW potential of the SET signal. The CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , and CONT D correspond to the above described control clock signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , and CONT D .The case in which the RESET barred RESET signal is applied to the control clock signal generation circuit is illustrated in Fig. 11. As shown in Fig. 11, the control signal CONT C is delivered through the AND gate 514 and the OR gate 520, during the period of theLOW potential of the RESET signal. The case in which the right shift operation is to be carried out is illustrated in Fig. 12. As shown in Fig. 12, the potential of the right shift left shift signal is madeHIGH, and the potential of the clock signal CLK is madeHIGH during a predetermined period. Accordingly, the signals S 501 through S 509 are changed as illustrated, and the control signals CONT A , CONT B , CONT C , andCONT D are delivered as illustrated through AND gates carrying even reference number. The case in which the left shift operation is to be carried out is illustrated in Fig. 13.As shown in Fig. 13, the potential of the right shift left shift signal is made LOW, and the potential of the clock signal CLK is made HIGH during a predetermined period.
