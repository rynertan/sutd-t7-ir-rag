## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates generally to the coloring of thermoplastics. In particular, it relates to the coloring of thermoplastics by the incorporation of color concentrates therein.Prior Art The coloring of thermoplastic articles by incorporation of pigments introduced as color concentrates is well known. Likewise, the coloring of synthetic thermoplastic fibers by absorption of dye from solution is also a common procedure. However, coloring of fibrous materials through the use of color concentrates is a less common practice. The reasons for this are many fold. It is imperative that the degree of dispersion of pigmentary particles in the concentrate be very high so that the spinning process will not be interrupted. On the other hand, preparation of masterbatches of dye concentrate, which would not have such a dispersion problem, by a chip dyeing procedure is complicated and expensive.Furthermore, the majority of color concentrates available today contain vehicles which are not totally compatible with, for instance, nylon, since nylon is one of the fibers which is less commonly colored by the addition of color concentrates. Described here is the preparation of pigment or dye concentrates in vehicles which are compatible with common fiberforming thermoplastic materials, in particular nylon. The procedure is simple and very flexible.It can be used to prepare concentrates of pigments or water or solvent soluble dyes, starting from dry colorant powders or from presscakes or aqueous or solvent dispersions. The concentrates can be used to color thermoplastic materials using blending techniques or melt injection of concentrate into polymer streams.The degree of dispersion is very good, so the concentrates can be used to color fibrous as well as more dimensionally uniform objects. Advantages of the instant system over those described in the prior art are a result of the advantages of employing a polymer which is soluble in water and or in organic solvents A. Water Pigments and dyes are precipitated from aqueous reaction mixtures during manufacture. Pigments are very finely divided at this point. Subsequent drying agglomerates pigment, and this is undesirable. Having a polymer which is water soluble allows for easy incorporation of pigment into polymer by mixing polymer solution and pigment dispersion and drying. Water soluble dyes can also be incorporated with no dispersion problem whatsoever and with very high color yields.B. Organic Solvent There are classes of dyes which are very soluble in certain organic solvents. Having a polymer soluble in these polar organic solvents enables one to make high concentration concentrates with no dispersion problem and with very high color yields.Statement of Closest Known Art 1. U.S. 1,119,960. The essence of this process is a transfer of pigment from aqueous to oil phase. This is a three phase process solid, aqueous and oil. The oil and the aqueous phase remain as two distinct liquids. The present process is two phase solid and one liquid. No surfactants are used. There is no concern about incomplete transfer of pigment, so no pigment is lost. There is no concern about partial miscibility of oil in water thus resulting in loss of some of the oil phase and contamination of the water. All of the instant polymer is recovered, and any water present is removed by drying. Another advantage of the present system is that a thermoplastic color concentrate can be made with ease from a process performed completely at room temperature.If the process of the reference is done at room temperature, it is necessary that the oil phase be a liquid, and thus the resulting colored product is not suited for handling using conventional plastic extrusion equipment.If the oil phase is a thermoplastic, then the process must be carried out at elevated temperatures. This is undesirable and also presents problems of miscibility of the different phases, because of viscosity differences and too rapid drying of the aqueous phase. Moreover, since the instant polymers are soluble in aqueous and polar organic solvents, one can incorporate dyes, both water soluble and solvent soluble, into such polymers at room temperature without going through a phase transfer process. The degree of dispersion achieved in a solid concentrate in the process of the reference is usually limited to the degree of dispersion originally present in the presscake. In the present invention, it is a simple matter to disperse the colorant, either in pure solvent or in the polymer solution or dispersion, to any desired degree of dispersion. 2. U.S. 3,360,497. This reference uses a phase transfer process. However, since the final phase thereof is hydrophobic and is not soluble in water, a preliminary phase transfer step is required in order to transfer pigment from aqueous to hydrophobic phase.Complicated surfactants are needed. This hydrophobic dispersion is then combined with a solution of polymer in a hydrophobic solvent. In an embodiment of the present system, polymer is added directly to the aqueous dispersion. This simplifies matters greatly. No preliminary phase transfer step is necessary and no phase transfer surfactants are needed. The problems of incomplete transfer and other problems associated with phase transfer as mentioned above are eliminated. The referenced system would have utility with solvent soluble dyes, but transfer of colorant from aqueous phase to oil phase is still required whereas the present system is a single liquid phase system. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTIONDifficulties resulting from the utilization of prior art processes and compositions are obviated by the provision of a color concentrate according to the present invention. This color concentrate is a blend of two essential components, advantageously a fluid phase blend, from which blend any solvent present during processing is subsequently removed.The first component is a water dispersible or organic solvent dispersible polymer which is capable of being 1 utilized in the preparation of a 1 95 solution or dispersion 2 recovered from a 1 95 solution or dispersion thereof at a temperature which will not cause substantial volatilization or degradation thereof 3 fused at standard thermoplastic processing temperatures that is, between about 130 and 3500C 4 melted with a thermoplastic material to be colored without substantial degradation or reaction and without any visible separation on a microscopic scale and 5 utilized as a wetting agent for pigments. The second component is a heat stable, chemically inert coloring agent selected from the group consisting of water soluble dyes, organic soluble dyes, polymer soluble dyes, and pigments.Especially advantageous results are achieved if the first component of the concentrate is selected from the group consisting of water dispersible or organic solvent dispersible polyamides water dispersible or organic solvent dispersible polyesters water dispersible or organic solvent dispersible vinyl polymers or copolymers and water dispersible or organic solvent dispersible alkylene oxide polymers or copolymers. Under such conditions, very beneficial results are obtained when the coloring agent is a pigment, which is present in the color concentrate in an amount sufficient to provide from about 1 to about 70 percent by weight thereof, based on the total weight of the color concentrate.Equally beneficial results are achieved, moreover, if the coloring agent is a dye, which is present in the color concentrate in an amount sufficient to provide from about 1 to about 70 percent by weight thereof, based on the total weight of the color concentrate.Concentrates according to the present invention are utilized with especially advantageous results in coloring thermoplastic polymeric materials which are employed in the production of synthetic textile fibers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS EXAMPLE S The following examples set forth in detail various methods of preparing and utilizing color concentrates according to the present invention. As is understood by those of skill in the art, these examples are illustrative in nature, and should not be taken as limiting the invention in any way.EXAMPLE 1 176 g of the water dispersible polyamide of USP 3,846,507 was combined with 704 g of water. The mixture was stirred at 800C until dispersion of the polymer was complete.200g of Hilton Davis Peacoline copper phthalocyanine Blue 37.7 solids presscake was placed in a two quart stainless steel Waring blender. 80g of the aqueous polymer dispersion was added to the blender. The mixture was blended for 25 minutes. The remaining 800g of polymer dispersion was added in 200g increments with approximately 10 minutes blending time between increments. Microscopic examination of the pigment slurry at this point revealed very good wetting of the pigment by the vehicle and dispersion of the pigment in the vehicle.The slurry was then filtered through a 35mm screen pack assembly consisting of 4 filter screens a 20 mesh, a 60 mesh, a 180 mesh, and a 325 mesh 40 micron screen. One filter change was required. The slurry was then collected in a shallow pan and dried under vacuum at 600C until hard approximately 2 days . This yielded a color concentrate containing 30 pigment. One part of the solid color concentrate was blended with 29 parts of uncolored nylon 6 polymer containing 0.032 titanium dioxide. This mixture was extruded into yarn comprised of fiber of 52 denier filament at a temperature of 2550C and a spinning speed of 330 meter minute. This fiber was then drawtwisted at a draw ratio 3.4 to 1 at a speed of 400 meters minute with a twist of 0.25 turns inch to yield yarn containing drawn fiber of approximately 16 denier f ilament. Deeply colored blue fiber containing 1 pigment was obtained.EXAMPLE 2The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the Hilton Davis Peacoline Blue 37.7 solids presscake was replaced by duPont Monastral Green G 53.4 highsolids presscake.
