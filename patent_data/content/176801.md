# A peripheral apparatus for image memories.

## Abstract
A peripheral apparatus for image memories can com municate image data with a memory assembly composed on n blocks 60 63 of a standard type DRAM, whether DRAM is of page mode or of nibble mode. The apparatus comprises a read data processing unit 82 sending the data of selected one among n pixels read from the DRAM blocks in parallel to an external image graphics processor 2 , a write data processing unit 84 modifying the image data taken therein to and writing the modified data in the DRAM blocks, a feedback data 86 processing unit writing the image data now on displaying into the DRAM blocks after a desired processing again, a display data processing unit 88 sending the data read from the DRAM blocks to a monitor for display and to the external processor 2 for the feedback processing, and a control unit 80 furnishing control signals to those processing units in response to instructions from the exter nal processor.
