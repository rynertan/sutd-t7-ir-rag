# Print velocity control apparatus for single element impact printers.

## Abstract
The mechanism disclosed herein is capable of ad justing the velocity with which a print element is projec ted toward a record sheet such that the impact velocity and, thus the impact forces, are controlled and varied. The control of the velocity with which the print element located on a shaft 22 is propelled against the record sheet is accomplished by a cam 26 which rotates with the print element during character selection and has thereon a plurality of rises corresponding to a displacement of a cam follower 30 engaged with a print cam 12 . The print cam 12 is formed to present, in a plurality of different planes perpendicular to its axis, a like plurality of cam profiles and rises. By shifting the print cam follower 30 from one plane to another along the axis of the print cam 12 the velocity of the print element may be selected and controlled. This velocity selection is a direct result of the amount of rise in the cam 26 attached to the shaft 22 which rotates the print element.
