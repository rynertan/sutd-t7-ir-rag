# VOLTAGE COMPARATOR OF A TYPE OF LOW POWER COMSUMPTION.

## Abstract
Current supply circuits 23 , 24 having switching ele ments are inserted on the power supply side 31 and on the power return wire side 32 of a differential amplifier means 10 in a voltage comparator, and are turned on or off. This makes it possible to obtain a voltage comparator which inter mittently operates at high speeds consuming a reduced amount of electric power.
