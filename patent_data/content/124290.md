# Drilling apparatus.

## Abstract
A boring head for duo pipe drilling apparatus, the boring head comprising a body having a coupling end and a cutting end, a passage for material return extending through the body from the cutting end to the coupling end, said passage having an inlet at the cutting end displaced relative to the intended axis of rotation of the head and an exit at the coupling end which is coaxial with the intended axis of rotation of the head, the cutting end comprising cutting means constructed and arranged such that in use cut material is mechanically displaced into the inlet of the passage for material return, fluid supply galleries opening into said passage for material return so as to direct fluid flow towards the exit of said passage to flush cut material in said passage to the exit, the coupling end of the boring head being adapted for con nection to a duo pipe system such that the annular passage for pressurized fluid of the duo pipe system is in communication with the fluid supply galleries of the boring head and the inner tube of the duo pipe system is in communication with the exit of the passage for material return of the boring head.
