## Description
STRONTIUM AND BARIUM CONTAINING ALKOXYLATION SYSTEMS This invention relates to the production of alkoxylated organic compounds by reacting said compounds in the presence of barium containing or strontium containing catalysts or promoted barium containing and strontium containing catalysts. More particularly, this invention relates to the production of alkoxylated organic compounds by reacting said compounds in the presence of these catalysts with adducting materials such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The general reaction of a variety of organic material together with an adducting material such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide to form alkoxylated materials is known in the art. For example, U.S. Patent 2,683,087 discloses that water adsorption by paper articles is improved by the use of amine adducts of ethylene oxide. Another pulp and paper use is disclosed in Etho Chemicals by Armour andCompany which discloses that ethoxylated resin fatty acid or ethoxylated stearic acid are incorporated in formulations used for deinking wastepaper.

Polyol ethoxylates find uses in foods and feds.As an examnle. U.S. Patent 2,674.534 discloses the use of sorbitol laurate and sorbitol oleate adducts in the coating of ice crean bars. The use of ethoxylated fatty acids such as 8 etho coco fatty acid has been recognized as a feed additive to accelerate animal growth. Alkylene oxide adducts are also used in the leather industry in formulations for tanning, dyeing, and lubricating leathers. U.S. Patent 2,893,811 shows the use of 12 to 18 carbon atom etho fatty amines for dyeing oEvegetable tanned leathers. U.S. 2,946,649 shows that adducts of higher molecular weight sulfonamides are effective tanning agents. Adducts of these materials also have a variety of uses in metal working industries. Ester, ether, and amine adducts are the products used most frequently. Cleaning of metal via degreasing using alkali is practiced extensively.Because of the low foaming characteristics, adducts of esters, ethers, and amines are preferred over many other agents when metals are sprayed b alkaline media. Efficiency of a degreasing bath is improved by the addition of a lauric acid adduct. Ethylene oxide adducts such as sorbitan monostearate abducts have been found useful in pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations and are used to provide activities such as drug carriers, emulsifiers, and solublizers. Some adducts have their own pharmacological actions. Oleic acid adducts plus other substances impart mechanical and chemical stability to latex rubber. U.S. Patent 3,088,796 discloses a formulation which imparts protection to metal surfaces against corrosion by a flowing stream, one component of such formulations being an ethoxylated alkylamine. U.S. Patent 3,060,132 discloses that a Ziegler catalyst can be modified to prevent the loss of activity on storage by the addition of ethododecyl mercaptan. German 1,142,465 discloses that polyglycol esters derived from reacting ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide with aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids prevents carburetor icing when added to gasoline. Other uses for alkylene oxide and propylene oxide adducts are given in Schonfeldt, SurfaceActive Ethylene Oxide Adducts, Pergammon Press, OxfordEngland, 1969 pages 386 through 631. These reactions are normally carried out using alkaline catalysts, which invariably produce a distribution of various adducts. In surfactant applications, an adduct containing too few adducting molecules is not effective because of poor solubility, while one with too many adducting molecules is undesirable because surface tension reduction per unit mass decreases drastically as the molecular weight increases. Therefore, most desirable adducts deal with as sharp a distribution in the desired mole adduct range as possible. Normally, an acid catalyzed reaction will produce such alkoxylates, but such catalysts also produce higher levels of harmful side products which must be separated and removed prior to use. Therefore, great benefit would be provided by a catalyst system which provides low by product levels while retaining the desired mole adduct distribution of acid catalysts. Such catalysts could promote the narrowing of the product distribution curve which could contribute significantly to the intrinsic value of the adducts produced. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst and method for obtaining alkoxylated adducts of a variety of organic materials using strontiumcontaining and or barium containing catalysts. Other objects will become apparent to those skilled in this art as the description proceeds. It has now been discovered according to the present invention that materials selected from the group consisting of polyols, aldehydes, ketones, amides, amines, acids, and mercaptans can be alkoxylated by contacting these materia with an alkoxylating agent in the presence of a catalyst selected from the group consisting of strontium metal, barium metal, strontium oxide, barium oxide, strontium hydroxide, hydrated strontium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, hydrated barium hydroxide, strontium hydride, barium hydride, or mixtures of these wherein the alkoxylation is carried out at temperatures of from about 900C to about 2600C. The process of the instant invention can be carried out at ambient pressure. However, pressures up to about 100 pounds per square inch gauge, psig can also be used. Pressures below about 60 psig are preferred. Pressures below ambient can also be used but are not preferred. It is clear that while pressure or lack of pressure is not a detriment to the process of the present invention, it is simply more convenient to carry out the reaction in the pressure range of from about atmospheric to about 100 psig. The instant invention is normally carried out at temperatures of from about 1200C to about 2600C. However, for practical purposes commercial operations will normally be carried out in a temperature range of from about 1500C to about 2000C. Temperatures in the range of from about 1600C to about 1900C are most preferred. Reactions can be carried out in the presence of any alkoxylating agent which produces a mole adduct of the sort desired. Normally such agents are alpha or beta alkylen oxides. In most commercial operations either ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or mixtures of these will be used to produce an adduct. Of these products, ethylene oxide is most preferred. Reaction products can have any desired content of alkoxylating agents such as ethylene oxide, but will normally range from about 30 to about 80 content of ethoxylating agent based on weight. For most purposes, the content of alkoxylating agent will range from about 408 to about 70 by weight. The amount of such materials present in the reaction is not critical other than the minimum amount necessary to provide sufficient units to reach the mole adduct level desired for the material being reacted. The strontium containing and barium containing catalysts of the present invention are basic catalysts which provide the benefits of such catalysts while greatly reducing the amount of unreacted materials and undesirable by products normally found in sharp distribution reactions. In addition, the instant invention provides that effective amounts of promoters can be added to the strontium containing and barium containing catalysts. These promoters are selected from the group consisting of phenols, acids, amines, amides, aldehydes, polyols, ketones, or alcohols in order to further reduce by product reactions and to reduce or eliminate any induction periods necessary for alkoxylation to begin. Representative examples of strontium containing materials are strontium metal, strontium hydride, strontium oxide, strontium hydroxide, and strontium hydroxide.XH2O where X represents the number of water molecules present. Representative examples of barium containing materials are barium metal, barium hydride, barium oxide, barium hydroxide, and barium hydroxide.XH2O where X represents the number of water molecules present. Many of the strontium and barium compounds alone are active in the process of the present invention and are extremely active when used with an effective amount of a cocatalyst or a promoter. Mixtures of these catalysts can be used. When used, these catalyst mixtures can be used in any desired effective quantity. However, the larger the quantity used, the more quickly the reaction goes to completicLarger quantities do not appear to significantly alter the distribution obtained. For practical purposes, normally at least about 0.18 strontium or barium catalyst, based on the weight of the material to be reacted is present in the reaction, but up to about 5 weight percent is commonly used.Most commercial reactions will use from about 0.1 to about 2.0 weight percent based on the weight of the material to be reacted. The amount of promoter or co catalyst which should be present with a strontium or barium containing catalyst is generally an effective amount. The effect of the co catalyst or promoter becomes significant at somewhat above 0.1 by weight based on the weight of the material to be reacted.It is logical to expect an upper limit after which any promoter present produces no additional benefits. Normally, these materials are added to the strontium or barium catalysts in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 2 by weight based upon the weight of the material to be reacted. It is very apparent that these limits can be varied substantially. While the instant invention is effective with all classes of polyols, aldehydes, ketones, amines, amides, acids, and mercaptans, it is preferred that the instant invention alkoxylate materials be selected from the group consisting of a polyols having boiling points above 1000C, a total of 2 to 30 carbon atoms and having 2 or more adjacent or non adjacent hydroxyl containing moieties of the general formulaEMI6.1 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, aryl groups, cyclic groups, or hydrogen, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functional groups selected from the group consisting of ether, amine, carboxyl, halogen, nitro, carbonyl, and amide aldehydes and ketones having boiling points above 100 C, a total of from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, and having one or more adjacent or non adjacent carbonyl containing moieties of the general formulaEMI7.1 wherein R1 and R2 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, halogen, nitro, amine, or amide primary, secondary, or tertiary amides having boiling points above 100 C and a total of from 1 to 30 carbon atoms and containing 1 or more amide containing moeities of the general formulaEMI7.2 wherein R1 R2, and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more other functionalities selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, ether, carboxyl, carbonyl, amine, nitro, or halogen primary, secondary, or tertiary amines having a boiling point above 100 C, a total of from 1 to 30 carbon atoms and having 1 or more amine containing moieties of the general formula EMI8.1 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of hydroxylr ether, carbonyl, halogen, carboxyl, nitro, or amide and e organic acids having boiling points above 100 C, a total of 1 to 30 carbon atones and having 1 or more adjacent or non adjacent carboxylic acid containing moieties of the general formulaEMI8.2 wherein R1 is hydrogen, a linear or branched acyclic group, alicyclic group, cyclic group, or aryl group, and wherein the R group can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carbon, hydroxyl, halogen, ether, nitro, amine, or amide f mercaptans of the general formulaEMI8.3 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, aryl groups, or cyclic groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain functional groups selected from the group consisting of halogen nitro, carboxyl, amine, crrjonyl, ether, and amide. It has also been discovered that the present inventi can be carried out even more effic r.tly and rapidly in the presence of a catalyst promoter. catalyst promoter can be materials which are added to an ali lation system together w the catalyst or catalysts of choir. Representative examples catalyst promoters useful in the process of the present invention are polyols, aldehydes, ketones, amides, amines, acids, phenols, mercaptans, and alcohols, wherein the alkoxylation is carried out at a temperature of from about 900C to about 2600C. Useful promoters for the strontium containing and barium containing catalysts of the present invention are a polyols having boiling points above 1000C, a total of 2 to 30 carbon atoms and having 2 or more adjacent or non adjacent hydroxyl containing moieties of the general formulaEMI9.1 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, aryl groups, cyclic groups, or hydrogen, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functional groups selected from the group consisting of ether, amine, carboxyl, halogen nitro, carbonyl, and amide b aldehydes and ketones having boiling points above 1000C, a total of from 2 to 30 carbon atoms and having one or more adjacent or non adjacent carbonyl containing moieties of the general formulaEMI9.2 wherein R1, R2 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groats can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, halogen, nitro, amine, or amid c primary, secondary, or tertiary amides having boilin points above 100 C, a total of from 1 to 30 carbon atoms and containing 1 or more amide containing moieties of the general fdrmula EMI10.1 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more other functionalities selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, ether, carboxyl, carbonyl, amine, nitro, or halogen d primary, secondary, or tertiary amines having boiling points above 100 C, a total of 1 to 30 carbon atoms and containing 1 or more amine containi moieties of the general formulaEMI10.2 wherein R1, R2, and R3, are, independently, hydroger linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, ether, carbonyl, halogen, carboxyl, nitro, or amide and e organic acids having boiling points above 1000C, a total of 1 to 30 carbon atoms and having 1 or more adjacent or non adjacent carboxylic acid containing moieties of the general formulaEMI10.3 wherein R1 is hydrogen, a linear or branched acyclic group, alicyclic group, cyclic group, or aryl group, and wherein the R group can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carbonyl, hydroxyl, halogen, ether, nitro, amine, or amide f phenols having boiling points of above 100 C, a total of from 6 to 30 carbon atoms and having 1 or more functionalities of the general formulaEMI11.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are, independently, hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, nitro, ether, or carbonyl, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, aryl groups, or substituted aryl groups, and wherein in addition the R designated groups can contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of halogen, ether, nitro, carboxyl, carbonyl, amine, amide, or hydroxyl, primary and secondary, linear and branched and g mercaptans of the general formulaEMI11.2 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, halogen, nitro, amine, or amide In some cases it is advantageous to preform or prereact the catalyst promoter with the catalyst prior to addition to the alkoxylation system.When this is carried out, the desired amount of catalyst is reacted with an effective amount of promoter for a period of time ranging up to about 4 hours up to about 200 C.
