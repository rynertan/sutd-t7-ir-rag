# Hot air ladle preheat station.

## Abstract
The hot air ladle preheat station 10 comprises an outer casing 16 defining an opening 70 for receiving a separately supported ladle 12 to be preheated. The open ing 70 is dimensioned so wide as to form a dilution air space 72 about the ladle exterior. A wall 18 is spaced inward to the outer casing 16 and defines a space 74 therebetween having a lower section 30 for accommodat ing the ladle in spaced apart relationship from it and an upper flue section 28 connected via a recuperator 20 to a stack 22 . A burner 32 is associated with the wall 18 in the lower section 30 for directing a flame 68 into the ladle 12 substantially coaxially thereto. Products of com bustion are directed into the ladle 12 and exit from the ladle interior 64 into the space 74 formed with the wall 18 . The products of combustion mix with and are cooled by the outside air entering through the dilution air space 72 and the mixture thus formed passes through the upper flue section 28 and through the recuperator 20 in heat ex change relationship with combustion sustaining gas utilized in the burner 30 .
