# Poly diisopropenyl benzene synthesis.

## Abstract
It has been unexpectedly found that meta diisopropenyl benzone can be polymerized into poly m diisopropenyl ben zene with a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution and with only a small degree of crosslinking gel formation if done in the presence of at least one alpha olefin containing from 2 to 12 carbon atoms in tetrahydrofuran solvent at low temperatures employing an alkyl lithium initiator. The poly m diisopropenyl benzene produced by employing this technique has an isopropenyl moiety on almost every diiso propenyl benzene repeat unit in the polymer. This polymer is particularly useful since its pendant isopropenyl groups can be further reacted with other compounds leading to polymers with various functionalities. This technique can also be employed in the synthesis of copolymers containing repeat units derived from meta diiso propenyl benzene and one or more other monomers. The copolymers synthesized using the process of this invention contain an essentially quantitative number of unreacted iso propenyl groups on the meta diisopropenyl benzene repeat units in the polymer chain.
