# Method of injecting particulate polymer into a hydrocarbon in a pipeline.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are provided for maintaining polymer particles in readily recoverable, discrete form, and for injecting the particles into a pipeline hydrocarbon by dis posing particulate polymer within a storage hopper 10 hav ing a cone bottom and an auger 16 extending upwardly from the bottom, rotating the auger to cause the polymer particles to revolve in the hopper, reversing the rotation of the auger to pass polymer particles downwardly into a mixing chamber 12 below the hopper, the particles passing through a rotary metering valve 11 , and a bin activator 19 , intermediate storage 20 and rotary metering valve 11 at the upper end of the chamber, simultaneously spraying a liquid such as oil or water tangentially in the chamber optionally agitating the chamber and removing a slurry of particulate polymer and the liquid from the chamber and injecting the slurry into a pipeline hydrocarbon.
