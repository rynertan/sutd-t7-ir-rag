## Description
This invention relates to 3a,6,6,9a tetra methyldodecahydronaphtho 2,l,b furan to be referred to hereinbelow as ambrox of the following formula A EMI1.1 a process for producing the compound of formula A , and the use of the compound of formula A as a perfuming or flavoring modifier. Ambergris has previously been known as a material useful in the field of perfumes or flavors. It is a very important and expensive animal perfume material obtained by drying a foreign material formed in the intestinal tract of the sperm whale, which is considered as a calculus.Usually, ambergris is dissolved in alcohol to form a tincture and used as one component of various perfuming or flavoring properties. In recent years, however, it has become difficult to procure ambergris largely because of the restrictions of whale catching. The presence of various perfuming and flavoring components in the tincture of ambergriss is known. The key substance of the perfuming components is ambrox represented by the following formula B .EMI1.2 The ambrox of formula B has four asymmetric carbon atoms, and therefore, eight stereoisomers possibly exist. But the optically active isomer shown in formula B in which the fused ring forming moiety shows a trans steric configuration is the only compound which occurs naturally, has high diffusibility and gives off a very strong typical ambergris odor. Because of the difficulty of obtaining ambergris, chemically synthesized compounds of formula B have recently been used as a material for perfuming or flavoring preparations. One typical prior method of synthesizing ambrox of formula B comprises oxidizing 1 sclareol, an optically active compound present in the essential oil of naturally occurring Salvia sclarea, with chrosic acid to synthesize norambreinolide Helv. Chim. Acta., 14, 570 1931 1, then reducing the norambreinolide and cyclizing the reduction product as schematically shown below Dragoco Report, 11 12, 276 283 1979 1.EMI2.1 EMI2.2 EMI2.3 Sclareol norambreinolideEMI2.4 EMI2.5 EMI2.6 EMI2.7 B Ambrox However, the above method has many defects and disadvantages. For example, the starting sclaerol is an expensive material present only in several percent in the essential oil of Salvia sclarea. Its supply is unstable since it is derived from the naturally occurring material.The use of hazardous chromic acid as a reagent gives rise to an industrial hygienic problem. Moreover, the method uses aluminum lithium hydride which is highly inflammable and not suitable for industrial use. The ambrox produced is very expensive and gives rise to an economical problem in using it as a material for perfuming compositions. Chemistry Letters, pp. 757 760 1981 and pp.729 732 1983 proposed a method schematically shown below of synthesizing norambreinolide of formula 2 below, an intermediate of the compound of formula A of this invention, which comprises reacting trans ss monocyclo homofarnesylic acid in dichloromethane in the presence of tin tetrachloride, and discussed the reactivity of the above farnesylic acid in the case of using other Lewis acids SnBr4, TiC14, BF3 Et2O or protonic acids sulfuric acid, trichloroacetic acid . EMI3.1 2 Yield 57 This method, hpwever, requires an extremely low temperature of 780C which is not suitable for industrial practice. Furthermore, isomers are formed besides the compound of formula 2 , and the yield of the compound of formula 2 is as low as about 57 which is not entirely satisfactory. The above literature references state that with the above catalysts other than tin tetrachloride, no marked effect of stereoselectivity is obtained. The optically active ambrox of formula B is very expensive, and cannot be widely and economically used as a material for various perfuming or flavoring compositions. The present inventors have made extensive investigations in order to develop a process for synthesizing optically inactive ambrox of formula A in which the fused ring forming moiety shows a trans steric configuration natural type and which has not been synthesized heretofore, by a total chemical synthesis without using a naturally occurring material, and to elucidate the perfume characteristics of the compound of fromula A . These investigations have led to tbe discovery that optically inactive ambrox of formula A in which the fused ring forming moiety has a trans steric configuration can be produced industrially advantageously at low cost from an inexpensive raw material which is easy to synthesize or obtain. In particular, the present inventors have found that optically inactive ambrow of formula A can be totally synthesized industrially easily at low cost by cyclizing 2,5,5,8a tetramethyl 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 hydroxydecalin of the following formula 3 EMI4.1 in the presence of a base and p toluenesulfonyl chloride.The compound of formula 3 can be easily synthesized in two steps from a known compound, trans ss monocyclo homofarnesylic acid or its ester of the following formulaEMI4.2 wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group, which in turn can be easily synthesized from inexpensive dihydro ss ionone which is easy to synthesize or obtain. It has been unexpectedly found that the optically inactive compound of formula A has an amber like fragrance comparable to the fragrance of the optically active ambrox of formula B synthesized from sclareol with an excellent lasting effect. Investigations of the present inventors have shown that the compound of formula A can be synthesized industrially advantageously with more ease and at lower costs than the optically active ambrox of formula B , and can be used widely at low cost as a material for various perfuming and flavoring compositions. It has been found that the compound of formula A well harmonizes with various natural and synthetic perfumes, and can be used as a soft, mild and long lasting perfuming or flavoring modifier for various perfume compositions of woody, floral, green, fruity, musky and citrus notes. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide the composition of formula A not described in the prior literature, a process for producing the compound A , and a perfuming or flavoring composition comprising as an active ingredient the compound of formula A which has never been used heretofore. The above and other objects and advantages will become more apparent from the following description. The present invention provides t 3a,6,6,9a tetramethyldodecahydronaphtho 2,l,b furan of the following formula A EMI5.1 This compound can be synthesized by a process which comprises i reacting a trans ss monocyclohomofarnesy lic acid or an ester thereof represented by the following formula 1 EMI6.1 wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group, with trifluoroacetic acid to form decahydro 3a,6,6,9atetramethyl 3a alpha ,5a beta ,9a alpha ,9b beta naphtho 2,1 b furan 2 lH one of the following formula 2 EMI6.2 ii reducing the compound of formula 2 with bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminum sodium hydride lNaAlH2 OCB2CH2OCH3 2 to form 2,5,5,8a tetramethyl 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 hydroxydecalin of the following formula 3 EMI6.3 and iii cyclizing the compound of formula 3 by contacting it with p toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base to form the compound of formula A . The above process for producing the optically inactive ambrox of formula A can be shown by the following scheme. The compound of formula A can be synthesized industrially advantageously at low cost. EMI7.1 trans ss monocyclo norambrenolide homofarnesylic acidEMI7.2 In the above process, the starting trans ss monocyclohomofarnesylic acid of formula 1 can be easily synthesized from, for example,. dihydro s ionone. By converting the resulting cis and trans isomeric mixture into an ethyl ester and subjecting it to precise distillation, the compound of formula 1 can be easily obtained. The norambrenolide can be easily synthesized, for example, by catalytically reacting trans ss mono cyclohomofarnesylic acid which can be obtained as above with, for example, trifluoroacetic acid, optionally in an organic solvent. The reaction can be easily carried out, for example, at a temperature of about 200C to about 50 0C for about 10 minutes to about 5 hours. Trifluoroacetic acid used in the reaction is easily available on the market.The amount of trifluoroacetic acid is, for example, about 0.5 to about 10 times the weight of the compound of formula 1 . Preferably, the organic solvent which may be used is, for example, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, hexane or toluene. There is no particular restriction on the amount of the organic solvent used. It is, for example, about 0.5 to about 10 times the weight of the compound of formula 1 . After the reaction, the reaction mixture is successively washed with water and an aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate,in a customary manner. The organic layer is dried and the solvent is evaporated to give a crude oil. As required, this oil can be purified by such a purifying means as silica gel chromatography ether pentane benzene 4 1 2 . The 2,5,5,8a tetramethyl l 2 hydroxyethyl 2 hydroxydecalin can be easily synthesized by, for example, reducing the compound of formula 2 obtained in step i with bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminum sodium hydride NaAlH2 OCH2CH2OCH3 2 , as required in an organic solvent.This reaction can be carried out at a temperature of about 20 to about 80 0C for a period of about 1 to about 10 hours.The amount of bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminum sodium hydride used is, for example, about 0.5 to about 2 times the weight of the compound of formula 2 . Examples of the organic solvent are toluene, benzene, hexane and ether. The amount of the organic solvent used is, for example, about 1 to about 20 times the weight of the compound of formula 2 .After the reaction, the reaction mixture is sucessively washed with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, water, an aqueous solution of acetic acid and an aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate in a customary manner, and then dried. The organic solvent is then evaporated to give the compound of formula 3 as white crystals. The ambrox of formula A in accordance with this invention can be easily synthesized by, for example, catalytically reacting the compound of formula 3 obtained as above with p toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base. Organic bases such as pyridine, quinoline and triethylamine may be used as the base. The amount of the base is, for example, about 1 to about 20 times the weight of the compound of formula 3 . The amount of p toluenesulfonyl chloride used is preferably about 1 to about 10 moles per mole of the compound of formula 3 . The reaction can be carried out, for example, at a temperature of about 200C to about 500C for a period of about 1 to about 12 hours. After the reaction, the reaction mixture is poured into water and extracted with toluene, for example.The extract is washed successively with hydrochloric acid, water and an aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate in a customary manner. The organic solvent is evaporated to give the compound of formula A as white crystals. The ambrox of formula A , in spite of being an optically inactive isomer, has an amber like odor comparable to the odor of the natural type optically active ambrox. When it is mixed with other perfumes, it shows a marked duration and is usesul as a durable flavoring or perfuming modifier. Thus, according to this invention, there is provided a perfuming or flavoring composition comprising a conventional perfuming or flavoring agent or carrier and, as a perfuming or flavoring modifier thereof, a modifying amount of 3a,6,6 ,9a tetramethyldodecahydronaphtho 2,l,b furan of the following formula A EMI9.1 The conventional perfuming or flavoring agent or carrier may be one or more of conventional synthetic or natural perfumes or flavors, and known carriers or diluents for perfumes or flavors. The perfuming or flavoring composition of this invention imparts soft, mild and long lasting fragrance or flavor as a perfuming or flavoring modifier for various perfumes, foods and drinks, health preserving and hygienic articles and medical drugs. More specifically, when ambrox of formula A is blended with at least one synthetic perfume, a novel long lasting perfuming or flavoring composition can be prepared. When it is blended with reconstituted essential oils such as bergamot oil, lemon oil, geranium oil, mandarin oil or lavender oil, novel long lasting perfuming or flavoring compositions having the mildness and body of natural essential oils can be prepared. The ambrox of formula A also harmonizes well with various natural essential oils such as orange oil, lime oil, lemon oil, grapefruit oil, oak moss oil, citronella oil, vetiver oil, cinnamon oil, patchouli oil, thyme oil, clove oil, bergamot oil and rose oil, and novel long lasting perfuming or flavoring compositions emphasizing the characteristics of the essential oils can be prepared. Furthermore, when it is blended with blended perfumes comprising two or more natural perfumes and synthetic aromatic chemicals, for example fragrance compositions such as single floral perfumes such as rose, jasmin, lilac, osmanthus, carnation and lily of the valley, floral bouquets comprising combinations of these or modern floral bouquets or oriental bouqutes obtained by adding a green note, a spicy note or an aldehyde note to the aforesaid floral bouquets, or flavor compositions of strawberry, lemon, orange, grapefruit, apple or pineappple, there can be prepared perfuming or flavoring compositions which are mild, resemble natural perfumes or flavors and are longlasting. The amount of the ambrox of formula A to be blended is, for example, about 0.001 to about 508 by weight based on the weight of the composition. Thus, according to the present invention, a durable perfuming or flavoring fortifier composition comprising ambrox of formula A as an active ingredient.By utilizing this fortifier composition, there can be provided foods and drinks comprising the ambrox of formula A as a fragrant and flavoring component, perfumes and cosmetics comprising ambrox of formula A as a fragrant component, and health preserving or hygienic articles, or medical drugs comprising ambrox of formula A as a fragrant or flavoring component.For example, ambrox of formula A can be incorporated in a suitable amount capable of imparting its unique fragrance or flavor into drinks such as fruit juices, wines or liquors produced by using fruits, milks and carbonated drinks ice confectionary such as icecreams, sherbets and ice candies, other confectionary, jams, chewing gums, breads, coffee, cocoa and various types of tea, soups, flavors and seasonings, instant drinks and foods, and various snacks.
