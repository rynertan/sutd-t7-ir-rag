## Description
This invention relates to a reaction rail. This invention more particularly relates to a reaction rail for a transit system, which utilizes tracked vehicles powered by linear induction motors LIMs . One form of electrical drive for transit vehicles is the linear induction motor. Linear induction motors offer the advantage of mechanical simplicity, with consequent reduced maintenance requirements and greater reliability. Such a linear induction motor has a primary and a secondary, one of which is carried by the vehicle, and the other of which is provided in elongate form along the track. For transit systems, it is common to provide the linear induction motor primary, which is supplied with the drive current, on the vehicle itself. The secondary is then provided along the track. The secondary is, in this case, a passive component of the system, which provides a low reluctance path for the magnetic field and a low resistivity facing material which enables the necessary induction currents to be generated. This enables the required thrust between the primary and the secondary to be generated. It is to be appreciated that, since the secondary extends along the full length of the track, it is important that the secondary should be as cheap and economical as possible. Any construction that is excessively elaborate, will have a significant effect on the overall cost of a transit system. At the same time, the magnetic and electrical properties of the secondary should be as optimum as possible, otherwise the overall efficiency of the system will be impaired. A common configuration for the primary and secondary of the linear induction motor is the so called single sided linear induction motor. In this case, both the primary and the secondary have just a single planar side or surface facing each other. As compared to, for example, double sided systems where the primary might run in a slotted secondary, this has the advantage of relative simplicity. For a transit system using railway vehicles, the secondary is formed as a reaction rail extending longitudinally between the two rails of the track. At switches and the like, small gaps can be provided in the reaction rail. This has little effect on the overall efficiency on the system, whilst not affecting the layout of the tracks themselves. A simple and cheap construction for such a reaction rail could utilize solid iron and solid aluminum. Thus, for example, one could have a continuously extruded aluminum top surface. Below this, a continuous length of iron, of appropriate magnetic properties, having the required cross section would extend. The aluminum would provide the electrical path necessary for the currents induced by the magnetic field from the primary, whilst the iron would complete the magnetic circuit formed between the primary and the secondary. Such an arrangement has the disadvantage that unwanted eddy currents would be generated in the conductive iron impairing the effectiveness of the magnetic circuit. This factor results in a reduction in LIM performance. As is known for rotary machines, the problem of eddy currents can be eliminated by the provision of laminated iron cores. In rotary machines, this is achieved by clamping together a large number of thin iron sheets, with thin layers of electrical insulation between. The direction of the laminations is such as to provide a relatively uninterrupted magnetic path in the required direction, whilst interrupting the paths along which eddy currents might arise. Such an arrangement can considerably reduce eddy currents. However, for a reaction rail, which might be provided along many miles of track, such a construction is complex and costly. Theoretically, one could construct the iron core of a reaction rail from a large number of elongate strips, with insulation between, each strip being relatively thin and flexible. For a typical reaction rail, experience has shown that assembly of such an iron core requires care and special techniques. It is necessary to secure the laminations together by transverse bolts or the like. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a reaction rail construction, which has good electrical and magnetic properties, but which is relatively simple and economic to produce. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a reaction rail assembly, for forming a secondary of a linear induction motor that includes a linear induction motor primary mounted on a vehicle. The reaction rail comprising an elongate aluminum member, which is of generally uniform cross section and is adapted to be secured to a track and which has a surface that, in use, faces a corresponding surface of a linear induction motor primary, and a ferromagnetic core comprising a plurality of elongate bars, extending parallel to the aluminum member, with adjacent bars being insulated from one another across the reaction rail so as to reduce eddy current losses and with each bar having a width and a height comparable to one another, the elongate bars being located adjacent the aluminum member, so as, in use, to complete a magnetic circuit formed between a primary and a secondary of the linear induction motor. As a result of extensive testing, it has been discovered that a provision of numerous relatively narrow laminations in the ferromagnetic core are not necessary. As detailed below, it has been discovered that a relatively simple theory can be used to calculate the effective resistivity of the iron core as a function of lamination thickness. This calculation, combined with an analysis of the electromagnetic fields in a 2 dimensional longitudinal cross section of the motor, show that under the type of operating conditions seen by this type of LIM, relatively thick bars or laminations can provide similar performance to configurations having ideal zero conductivity iron. In contrast to known constructions, this enables a cheap and simple construction to be used for the core, whilst maintaining the eddy current losses at an acceptable low levee. For example, to assemble the core, the individual bars could simply be welded together by a predetermined pattern of short weld beads, along their underside. There is no need to provide elaborate and complex mounting arrangements to maintain each bar in position, as is common for laminated constructions. Our copending Canadian Patent Application is concerned with a top cap or conductive member suitable for use, in the reaction rail of the present invention. The conductive member is formed with a profile such that, when assembled together with the core along a track, the conductive member or top cap is pre stressed as as to be urged against the core. The purpose of this is to ensure that the conductive member is always located adjacent the core, and consequently undergoes little movement in use. This is important, as there is usually a relatively close spacing between the outer surface of the conductive member and the corresponding surface of a vehicle born primary. It has been found with flat profile top cap extrusions that the mechanical forces at the lateral edges due to tightening of the hold down bolts can cause the top cap to bow upwards away from the back iron at the centre. This situation leads to reduced mechanical clearance between the LIM primary and top cap surface. It also contributes to an increase in acoustic noise due to the effects of small, audible frequency mechanical vibrations which occur when the LIM primary passes. By prestressing the top cap during assembly, it should always firmly abut the iron core. For a better understanding of the present invention and to show more clearly how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, which show a preferred embodiment of the present invention and in which Referring first to Figure 1, there is shown a reaction rail assembly generally denoted by the reference 1. The reaction rail assembly 1 is intended for mounting on the ties of a conventional railway track or on a concrete guideway not shown . The reaction rail 1 has ties 4, on which the working components of the reaction rail assembly 1 are mounted. On the ties 4 are elongate iron bars 6 and an elongate aluminum member or top cap 8. To secure the individual ties 4 to the ties of a conventional railway track, stud bolts 10 are provided. These are mounted at their lower ends not shown in the ties of a railway track. At their upper end, the stud bolts 10 each have two nuts 12. As detailed below, each tie 4 is formed from steel of hollow rectangular section, and includes a lower web 14. In the lower web 14 there are formed two elongate slots 16. Here, on either side of the web 14, for each stud bolt 10, there are two washers 18, whose diameter is slightly less than the length of the slot 16. Thus, as shown, a web 14 is mounted at each end on a stud bolt 10 and held by the nuts 12 between a pair of washers 18. The provision of the two nuts 12 enables the vertical position of the tie 4 to be adjusted at either end to the required height. Consequently, it is possible to adjust the reaction rail 1, so that it has a uniform height both along its length and across its width, within the required tolerances. The tie 4 includes an upper web 20, corresponding to the lower web 14, and two side webs 22, 24, forming the rectangular cross section see Figure 2 . At either end of the upper web 20, there are two holes formed for bolts holding the aluminum member 8 in position as described in detail below. Referring now to Figure 3, there is shown a cross section through the aluminum member 8. This shows the aluminum member 8 as produced, and unstressed. The aluminum member 8 comprises a central section 80 of uniform thickness and extending almost the full width of the member 8. As shown, the central section 80 is curved so as to be slightly concave on its top surface. Along either edge of the aluminum member 8, there are two channel sections 82. Each channel section 82 has a T shape cross section slot 84. Sides 86 of each channel section 82 are parallel to one another, and are inclined, together with a T shape slot 84, at an angle of 3 to the vertical. A top surface of an aluminum member 8 is denoted by the reference 88, and in use it faces a corresponding surface of a linear induction motor secondary carried by a vehicle not shown . Referring back to Figure 1, the reaction rail assembly 1 includes a ferromagnetic core 30. The core 30 is made up from 10 individual iron bars 32 of square cross section. Figure 5 shows the assembly of the iron bars 32. Prior to assembling the iron bars 82, their abutting faces are primed with a non conductive primer varnish, for example Relvine 7901. The iron bars 32 are then assembled together, so as to be level and free from gaps, with no twist on the length of the whole assembly. As denoted at 34 in Figure 5, short weld beads are provided on the underside in the pattern shown. This pattern could be repeated, for example, nine times along the length of the core 30. Also, welds 35 are formed at the ends of the bars 32. After welding, the ends of the iron bars 32 are ground flush. Then, after being cleaned suitably in known manner, the core 30 is provided with a suitable protective coating, for example Copan Coal Tar Epoxy No. 10. As shown in Figures 1 and 4, the core assembly 30 is placed on top of the ties 4. Then, the aluminum member 8 is placed on top of the core 30. To secure the aluminum member 8 in position, carriage bolts 40 are used. Each carriage bolt 40 has a corresponding key plate 42 as shown in Figure 8. Each key plate 42 is elongate, and has a width indicated at 44, which is slightly less than the width of the top part of each T shape slot 84. The length of each key plate 42 is greater than its width 44. In the centre of each key plate 42, in known manner, there is a square opening 46, corresponding to the similar square section portion of the shank of the carriage bolts 40. Prior to locating the aluminum member 8 on the ties 4, the carriage bolts 40 and associated key plates 42 are slid into position in the channel sections 82. As mentioned above, at each end of each tie 4, there are two openings for the carriage bolts 40. As shown in Figure 2, corresponding nuts 48 are secured to the carriage bolts 40, with washers 50 between the nuts 48 and the upper web 20. The co operation between the key plates 42 and carriage bolts 40 prevents rotation of the carriage bolts 40 as the nuts 48 are tightened. As the carriage bolts 40 are drawn down by the nuts 48, the aluminum member 8 is prestressed to the configuration shown in Figure 1. In this configuration, its central section 80 is maintained flat. As a result, the central section 80 maintains a constant force on the top of the core 30, and presses it against the ties 4. The reaction rail 1 is the means by which the thrust applied to a vehicle is transferred to the track bed. Consequently, it is necessary to provide for this thrust. For this purpose, at required intervals thrust rods 60 are provided See Figure 6 . Each thrust rod 60 is intended to extend between one of the stud bolts 10 and a tie of the conventional railway track. For this purpose, the thrust rod 60 includes a central sloped portion 62, a flat lower end portion 64 and an upper flat end portion 66. The lower flat end portion 64 includes a circular opening 68 for a bolt to secure it to a tie or concrete bed. The upper portion 66 includes a corresponding opening 69, which is elongate and intended to fit one of the stud bolts 10. The upper flat end portion 66 would be received below the web 14 and above the lower washer 18. Turning to Figure 9, there is shown a graph, which shows the variation of thrust with the number of iron bars 32. In this graph, the vertical axis denotes the thrust, whilst the horizontal axis gives the number of iron bars. The curve shown is derived from a theoretical analysis, based upon the application of the following theory to a two dimensional electromagnetic field analysis of the motor. It is assumed that the current in the core follows rectangular paths. For each path, the length is equal to the core pitch and the width is equal to the width of the corresponding bar, so that the overall width for the paths equals the width of the core 30. Further, it is assumed that sub dividing the core into separate bars or elements forces the current paths to be contained within each bar, thereby increasing the total effective length of the current path. Also, it is assumed the depth of penetration of current into the iron is constant for a number of bars 32. Now, for each bar 32, as viewed in plan, the resistance can be calculated from the following equation Figure 9 shows a theoretical calculation of the variation in thrust for a typical LIM motor. The maximum obtainable thrust is 11.8 KN. This is achieved with a large number of bars 32, so that there is little or no eddy current loss. As the number of bars 32 is reduced, then the eddy current loss begins to effect the thrust. As shown, with 18 bars 32, the thrust is close to the theoretical maximum. For 9 bars 32, the thrust obtainable is still only 2 below the maximum. Whilst for five bars, the thrust is reduced by 4 . If one has one bar, ie. a solid iron core, then the thrust is reduced by 13 . Using this analysis, in this embodiment of the present invention, it was established that ten bars 32 would be sufficient. This has the advantage of producing a thrust loss of less than 2 , which is quite acceptable. Simultaneously, the construction employed is considerably simpler than that including a large number of narrow laminations. One has bars 32 of square cross section, each of which is relatively sturdy and self supporting. One needs simply weld the bars 32 together on their undersides at a number of locations, to form the core 30. Strictly of course the welds will provide electrical interconnection between the bars 32, but in practice this effect is neglible . It will thus be seen that the overall construction of the present invention provides for a reaction rail that is relatively simple. It has a small number of components, and can be assembled quickly and simply. Provision is made at various points for accomodating large tolerances. Thus, the thrust rods 60 include elongate openings 69, to accomodate longitudinal displacement relative to the studs 10. Similarly, to position the ties 4 accurately, the elongate slots 16 are provided, so that the transverse position of the ties 4 can be adjusted as required. The longitudinal position of the ties 4 does not matter. The nuts 12 enable the reaction rail 1 to be placed at exactly the required height, both along its length and across its width. The nuts 12 are tightened relatively tightly, to make a secure construction. The nuts 48 for the carriage bolts 40 are tightened to a relatively low torque, for example 10 ft lbs. This permits longitudinal thermal expansion and contraction of the aluminium member 8, by sliding movement relative to the ties 4. It is to be appreciated that whilst a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described, many variations of the structure are possible. In particular, the arrangement of ties and bolts supporting the ties could be simplified. There may be installations in which a guide way is sufficiently accurately formed, to enable a reaction rail to be bolted directly to it, or via simple adjusting mechanisms, thus simplifying the design.
