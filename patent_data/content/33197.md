## Description
Method of improving the shell duality of poultry eggs This invention relates to a method of improving the resistance of poultry egg shells against crackina and breakate, which comprises administering to the laying birds a cartain combination of hydroxylated derivatives of VitaminD3 cholecalciferol . The proportion of eating eggs which have to be down graded because of cracked shells and those lost by breaking is of major commercial irrportance when the astronomical number of eating eqgs produced annually is taken into account.This problem has been extensively studied in recent years and among the various remedies proposed, the majority consisted in supplementation of certain dietary factors in the feed of the laying pultrv. The main ones of these supplerentary dietary factors, the effects Or which on the thickness, weioht and quality of the e shells have been studied, were calciun, phosphorus and Vitamin D3 cf., inter alia, J.D.Summers et al, Poultry Science 55 pp 4d2 413 1976 and Pran Vohra et al, Poultry Science 58 pp 432 440 1979 and references mentioned therein . The importance of Vitamin D3 for normal calcium homeostasis has been established and its requirements for optimal e production Parameters in the laying hens have been investigated. In recent vears it has been shown that thc biological effects of Vitamin D3 or Cholecalciferol in romoting calcium absorption from the intestine and mobili station of calcium in the bone, are due to hydroxylated metabolites of Vitamin D3, in particular 1 alpha 25 dihydroxy Vitamin 23 hereinafter 1 alpha ,25 OH 2D3 , formed in the body by 25hydroxylation of Vitamin D3 in the liver followed by hydroxylation in the kidney. The same metabolite 1 alpha ,25 OH 2D3 is formed by 25 hydroxylation in the liver of the synthetic analogue1 alpha hydroxycholecalciferol hereinafter 1 alpha OH D3 been this is administered to the body. while the biological activity of the aforementioned biologically active Vitamin D3 derivatives has been extensively studied in the last decade, there have been only comparatively few and mostly inferential reports of biological activity of another dihydroxylated metabolite of Vitamin D3, namely 24R,25 dihydroxy cholecalciferol hereinafter 24R, 25 OH 2D3 , resorted to have an effect on bone nineralisation cf. H.L. Henry and A.W. Norman,Science , Vol. 201, pp 835 837 1978 . The effects of various vitamin D3 metabolites on the egg production parameters in laying hens have also been studied.In most of these studies, said metabolites were administered to hens fed on Vitamin D3 def icient diets, i. e. dietary Vitamin D3 was replaced rather than supplemented by 25 OH D3, la, 25 OH 2D3 or by the analogue la CH D3. The results, as far as egq shell quality oi thickness are concerned, were far from satisfactory cf. summary in S.M. Abdulrahim et al, Poultry Science 58 pp 858 863 1979 .Whilst some of the earlier studies reported a beneficial effects of 25 0H D3 anS 1 alpha OH D3 on eggshell quality cf., eq. US Patent 4,012,509 and the corresponding BritishPatent 1,467,205 ,as compared to Vitamin D3, these findings could not be substantiated in were recent studies. Similarly, the effects of la,25 OH 2D3 and other vitamin D3derivatives on egg shell quality and shell weight were found to be merely comparable to the case of Vitamin D3 itself, even at higher levels of adminstration of these hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives. Sunning up, it can be stated that all the hitherto efforts to increase the resistance of the egg shell to cracking and breakaae by supplementing the feed of the poultry, have not resulted in any method yielding a measurable reduction in the proportion of cracked eggs. It has now been surprisingly found, in accordance with the present invention, that the shell quality of poultry eggs can be significantly improved by administering to the laying birds, while being fed on a normal Vitamin D3 containing diet, an effective amount of 24,25 OH 2D3 in combination with an 1 alpha hydroxylated Vitamin D3 derivative, i.e. 1 alpha 25 OH 2D3 or its precarsor 1 alpha OH D3. The present invention thus provides a method of improving the shell quality of poultry eqgs so as to increase their resistance against cracking and breakage, which comprises administering to the laying birds an effective amount of 24R,25 OH 2D3 in ccmbination with a effective amount of 1 alpha OH D3 and or 1 alpha ,25 OH 2D3 The cccbination of active vitamin D3 derivatives in accordance with the invention, is most comeniently i nistered to the laying birds in their feed.Applicants have found that in order to achieve significant imorovement of the egg shell quality, each laying bird should preferably receive from about 2ssg to about 4 g of 24R,25 OH 2D3 and from about 0.5 g to about 1.0 g of 1 alpha OH D3 or a similar amount of 1 alpha ,25 OH 2D3 per day. Since the daily feed consumption of a laying hen is about 100g, it follows that the aforementioned active vitamin D3 derivatives should be added to the poultry feed in the preferable amounts of from 20 to 40 g of 24R,25 OH 2D3 and form 5 g to 10 g of 1 OH D3 or 1 alpha ,25 OH 2D3 ner each kg. of feec. The invention is not limited, however, to the aforementioned method of adminstration, i.e. in the feed, of the active vitamin D3 derivatives, but extends to any other feasible manner of administration, e.g. in the drinking water of the poultry, by intramuscular injection of long acting preparations of the combination of active vitamin D3 derivatives, or by subcutaneous implantation of pellets comprising such prenarations in slow release form. The invention will not be described in more detail with the aid of the following non limiting example EXAMPLE Groups of 25 laying hens each of Leghorn breed, aged 6 to 7 months, were allowed free access to water and feed consisting of a normal diet with the following supplements per 1 ka of feed Control oroups 1 and 7 no feed supplements. Group No. 2 1 alpha OH D3 5 g Group No. 3 la,25 OH 2D3 5 g Group No. 4 24R,25 CH 2D3 20 g Group No. 5 1 alpha OH D3 5 g and 24R,25 OH 2D3 20 g Group No. 6 1 alpha 25 OH 2D3 5 g and 24R,25 OH 2D3 20g Group No. 8 1 alpha OH D3 10 g Group No. 9 1 alpha ,25 OH 2D3 10 g Grout No.10 24R,25 OH 2D3 40 uq Group No. 11 1 alpha OH D3 10 g and 24R,25 OH 2D3 40 g Group No. 12 1 alpha 25, OH 2D3 10 g and 24R,25 OH 2D3 40 g Eggs were collected startinq from the 6th day after the beginning of treatment and collection was continued for 3 aneks. The resistance of the egg shells against cracking was assayed by measuring egg shell deformation under predetermined mechanical stresses as follows Defonmation of the egg shell was measured on each egg using an apparatus comprising a micrometer. A stress of 1 kg and 2 kg, respectively, ass applied to the egg between tan opposite points on its longest diameter, and the resultinq deformations were read on the micrometer scale.In preliminary experiments it has been determined that the deformation of the egg shell e.q. at 2 kg stress is inversely proportional to the resistance of the egg shell against cracking. Thus, shells which at 2 kg stress underwent deformations of about 0.07 to 0.08 rrrn, cracked at pressures of about 3.5 kg, whereas ecigs which at 2 kg stress deformed only by about 0.05 to 0.06 irrn started cracking only at stresses of about 4.5 kg. The results of the various experiments are summarised in the following Table I TABLE IEMI7.1 tb Test SEP Group SEP Supplement SEP to SEP normal SEP diet SEP Average SEP shell SEP deformation tb SEP No. SEP g SEP per SEP 1 SEP kg SEP of SEP feed SEP mm SEP 10 2 SEP tb SEP 1 alpha OH D3 SEP 1 alpha ,25 OH 2D3 SEP 24R,25 OH 2D3 SEP Under SEP 1 SEP kg SEP Under SEP 2 SEP kg tb SEP stress SEP stress tb SEP 1 SEP control SEP SEP SEP SEP 3.28 SEP 6.76 tb SEP 2 SEP 5 SEP SEP SEP 3.00 SEP 6.70 tb SEP 3 SEP SEP 5 SEP SEP 3.11 SEP 6.72 tb SEP 4 SEP SEP SEP 20 SEP 3.26 SEP 6.88 tb SEP 5 SEP 5 SEP SEP 20 SEP 2.87 SEP 6.00 tb SEP 6 SEP SEP 5 SEP 20 SEP 2.80 SEP 5.96 tb SEP 7 SEP control SEP SEP SEP SEP 4.15 SEP 8.28 tb SEP 8 SEP 10 SEP SEP SEP 3.66 SEP 7.42 tb SEP 9 SEP SEP 10 SEP SEP 3.61 SEP 7.78 tb 10 SEP SEP SEP 40 SEP 3.71 SEP 7.61 tb SEP 11 SEP 10 SEP SEP 40 SEP 2.70 SEP 5.87 tb SEP 12 SEP SEP 10 SEP 40 SEP 2.83 SEP 5.84 tb As can be seen from the results in Table I above, no significant changes in egg shell deformation, as comer pared to the control groups, could be observed when the laying hens were fed on a diet supplemented with only a single one of the three tested vitamin D3 derivatives, at both the lower and higher levels of administration. Against this, when the diet was supplemented with the combination of 24R,25 0H 2D3 and either la CH D3 or la,25 CH 2D3 a significant decrease in the deformation of the egg shells was observed at both levels of administration. Thus, in accordance with the findings in the aforementioned preliminary experiments, it would follow that eaas produced by hens fed on a diet supplemented with either the lower or the higher level of the combination according to the invention, should resist cracking under stresses of up to about 4.5 kg, whereas eggs produced by the untreated hens of the control group parti cularly group No. 7 would crack already at stresses of about 3.5 kg.
