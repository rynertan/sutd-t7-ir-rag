# METHOD OF DIAGNOSING SYPHILIS

## Abstract
Murine anti Treponema pallidum monoclonal antibodies were employed in the detection of low numbers of pathogenic treponemes. Monocional antibodies were used as a primary antibody source in a solid phase immunoblot assay system. All monoclonal antibodies assayed were capable of detecting ca. 1.0 10³ to 2.5 10³ treponemes. Of 13 monoclonal anti bodies examined, 3 were able to detect 10³ virulent trepo nemes, and 1 of these antibodies was able to reveal the presence of as few as 500 organisms. Western blot analyses showed that all anti T. pallidum monoclonal antibodies ex hibiting high sensitivities for the detection of T. pallidum cells were directed against an abundant, 47,000 48,000 dalton surface exposed antigen of the organism. With two possible exceptions, the monoclonal antibodies tested reacted specifi cally with T. pallidum, either purified or found within a high contaminating tissue background, and not with Treponema phagedenis biotype Reiter, Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, herpes simplex virus type 2, or normal rabbit tes ticular tissue.
