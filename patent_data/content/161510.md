# Measurement device.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a measurement device for determining the degree of compaction of dam and road building material after the material has been compacted with a suitable compaction machine. The measurement de vice consists of a vibrating drum which is equipped with a transducer for generating signals while the drum is being run over the ground surface for which the degree of compac tion is to be determined. In order to eliminate factors which impede evaluation of the signals emanating from the signal transducers, the measurement device incorporated in the drum is designed so that its contact surface with the ground surface is as restricted as possible. One method of achiev ing this is by reducing the width of the drum and or shaping the casing surface of the drum in an arch in a plane parallel with the rotary axis of the drum.
