# A process for the treatment of aromatic polyamide fibers, which are suitable for use in construction materials and rubbers, as well as so treated fibers and shaped articles strengthened with these fibers.

## Abstract
A process for the treatment of aromatic fibers, which are suitable for use in construction materials and rubber by passing the fibers via one or more capillary entrances and outlets 2a and 2b through an area 8 wherein a reduced pressure is maintained and wherein a plasma is effected by means of a high frequent electrical field ob tained via a solenoide placed around said area. The aro matic polyamid fibers so obtained have a considerably improved adherence with a plastic matrix wherein they are used as weaponing fibers.
