# Heart valve prosthesis.

## Abstract
A heart valve protheses includes the usual generally annular body 23 having an interior surface 27 defining a blood flow passageway and having one or two occluders 25 supported thereon for alternately blocking and then allowing the flow of blood in a predetermined direction. Notches 39 are formed at opposite locations in the periphery of an occluder 25 and each is disposed about a pivot post 47 that projects radially inward from the interior surface 27 of the annular body 23 . A pair of stops 45,47 flank each pivot post 47 , having curved surfaces 57 at locations adjacent to the pivot posts 47 but oppositely disposed fulcrums and cooperate with the pivot posts 47 in defining the opening and closing movement of each occluder 25 . Preferably, the pivot pins and the step means 45,47 are formed as an integral structure. Self centering seats 161,163 can be used to provide a better seal in the closed position.
