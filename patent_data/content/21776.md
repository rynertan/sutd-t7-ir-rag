# Semiconductor memory device and method of making same.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device includes a plurality of memory cells formed on a semiconductor substrate 10 of one conductivity type, each of the memory cells comprising a first region 16 formed on the semicondutor substrate 1 a gate oxide layer 18 formed on the first region 16 a window 38 through the gate oxide layer 18 for diffusing impurities through a gate electrode 20 formed on the gate oxide layer 18 a second region 31 of opposite conductivity type to the first region 16 formed under the window 38 , by diffusing impurities through the window 38 , into the first region 16 , the second region 31 extending under a part of the gate electrode 20 and, a third region 14 having the same conductivity type as the first region 16 , formed on the second region 31 and under the window 38 , by diffusing impurities through the window 38 into the second region 31 , the gate electrode 20 covering the surface of the first region 16 and the second region 31 through the gate oxide layer 18 . This construction enables the size of the individual memory cells to be reduced to substantially 4FÂ², where F is equal to the minimum width of a patterning line. This is approximately half the minimum size previously achieved.
