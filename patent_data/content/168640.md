# ELECTRONIC THERMOMETER DETECTING AND DISPLAYING RISING FALLING, AND STABLE TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS

## Abstract
This electronic thermometer includes a means for sen sing a temperature to be measured and outputting an elec trical signal representative thereof a means for receiving this electrical signal, processing it, and storing values re presentative thereof over time a means for determining from these stored values representing the electrical signal over time whether the temperature to be measured is rising, is dropping, or is relatively stable a means for displaying a value representative of the current value of the electrical signal and thus of the temperature to be measured and a means for displaying the result, as determined by the deter mining means, of whether the temperature to be measured is rising, is dropping, or is relatively stable. Thereby, the user can form an estimation as to whether the sensing means is properly being applied, and as to whether the conduction of temperature to said sensing means has prop erly stabilized sufficient to provide a reliable temperature indication. Accordingly, the reliability of temperature moni toring is very good.
