# Apparatus for the subaqueous entrenching of pipes.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for the entrenching of pipes in underwater beds, of the type in which a framework, provided with excavating means, is positioned across the pipe 11 to be entrenched and dragged along the pipe so as to excavate two parallel trenches adjacent to both sides to the pipe, the pipe being entrenched due to the collapsing either spontaneous or caused by disgregating means of the bed zone thus remaining under the pipe already laid onto the bed. The excavated material is removed by means of a pump and discharged again, at a predetermined distance from and rearwardly of the framework, on the entrenched pipe. The framework is provided with side supporting skid members, by which furthermore the entrenching height is adjustable.
