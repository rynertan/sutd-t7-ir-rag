# Method of selecting a cutting position of a cutter with respect to a natural tobacco leaf.

## Abstract
A method of selecting the cutting position of a cigar wrapper cutter having a preselected shape with respect to a natural tobacco leaf L uses a remotely created leaf image of a given tobacco leaf, which image includes the outline of the given leaf, the position of the leaf stem and the areas with holes in the leaf. This method includes the steps of providing an outline image of a given cutter shape, shifting the outline image with respect to the leaf image until the outline image is in a selected position avoiding the outline, the stem and any hole areas of the leaf image, and then creating cutting coordinates indicative of said selected position for use in controlling a cutting position of the cigar wrapper cutter on a given leaf.
