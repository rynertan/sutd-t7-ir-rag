# Ream skid discharge arrangement for continuous discharge sheeter and method.

## Abstract
A continuous sheeting machine is formed with a sheet collection area for the accumulation and stacking of sheets into either ream or skid loads. Separate lift table and discharge means are provided for the respective ream collection or skid loading operations. Changeover between skid loading and ream collection is automatic. A ream collection system 30 is stowed in a retracted position beneath the discharge area of the sheeting machine during skid loading. In the skid loading mode, two large scissor lift tables 16, 17 shuttle concurrently respectively back and forth between the collection area and a discharge station, such that skid load collection is substantially continuous. For ream collection, the skid load tables are removed from the collection area and a ream collection framework is shuttled out from beneath the sheeting machine so that a small, high speed ream lift table is positioned in the collection area. As the ream collection table 31 is passed into the collection area, a skid guard 70 is pivotally moved between its former upstanding, operational position beneath a kick off assembly in the sheeting machine discharge area to a lowered, stowed position beneath the ream lift table.
