# Method for the resolution of racemic 2 CP difluoromethoxy phenyl 3 methylbutyric acid.

## Abstract
A method for the preparation of certain difluorometh oxyaromatic compounds useful as intermediates in the preparation of pyrethroid pesticides. The method comprises alkylating a p substituted phenol with excess chlorodifluoro methane at atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure in the presence of a base, water, and an inert water miscible organic solvent or solvent mixture, alone or in the presence of benzyltriethylammonium chloride, to yield a difluoro methoxyaromatic compound and, when said difluoroaro matic compound contains a side chain acetic acid ester having a chiral center, optionally, a hydrolyzing said ester to the corresponding racemic acid and thereafter resolving said racemic acid into its dextrorotatory acid and levorotatory acid isomers and recovering said acid isomer, or b hydrolyzing said ester to the corresponding racemic acid, resolving said racemic acid into its d acid and 1 acid isomers, recovering said d acid for use in the preparation of pyrethroid product, esterifying the above said 1 acid from the resolution, racemizing the thus prepared 1 ester from said esterification, and hydrolyz ing the same to obtain racemic acid which is recycled for admixture with the fresh racemic acid and subsequent re solution.
