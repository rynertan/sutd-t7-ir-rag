# Ultrasonic diagnostic equipment.

## Abstract
The ultrasonic diagnostic equipment in accordance with the present invention is constructed so as to detect the phase shift of the received signal of an ultrasonic wave transmitted by an ultrasonic transducer 22 and reflected by an object in order to find a hologram signal for the object, and to obtain the reconstructed data for the object by carrying out synthetic aperture operation by using the hologram signal and a kernel signal, and furthermore, it is arranged so as to detect the variations in the maximum amplitude value of the reconstructed result by varying the kernel signal relative to the hologram signal of the object, and to find the velocity of the ultrasonic wave from the kernel signal that gives rise to the largest maximum value of the amplitude.
