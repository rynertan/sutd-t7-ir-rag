# Process for producing a flat glass.

## Abstract
A process for producing a flat glass, which comprises withdrawing a glass ribbon substantially horizontally from the surface of a molten metal bath while maintaining the level of the surface of the molten metal at a level higher than an end wall at the outlet of the bath from which the glass ribbon is withdrawn and preventing the overflow of the molten metal from the end wall by means of a force induced by a linear induction motor, wherein side walls at the outlet of the bath are made of an electroconductive material thereby to prevent a drop of the induced force in the vicinity of the side walls.
