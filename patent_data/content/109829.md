# Fabric mounting track system.

## Abstract
A fabric mounting track consisting of two parts, a back support plate 11 and a hinge lock plate 10 . The hinge lock plate 10 has a straight portion 15 at one end and a substantially circular portion 12 at the other end forming a hinge. The hinge is disposed in a plane spaced from the straight portion 15 . The back support plate 11 also has a substantially circular portion 22 at one end forming a larger hinge into which the smaller hinge of the hinge lock plate 10 fits. Extending from the straight portion 24 of the back support plate 11 at an acute angle is a ledge 26 , while the other end 30 terminates in a straight portion forming a small angle, and which may have its free end extending in the opposite direction. The hinge lock plate 10 is provided with substantially equally spaced lancings 16, 17 punched out from the straight portion 15 of the hinge plate 10 . At intervals between a number of lancings, one 12 of the lancings is larger in size. It will pierce the fabric 32 to support it while the back support plate 11 is hanging down from the hinge lock plate 10 . Thereupon the hinge lock plate 10 is rotated at 180 so that the large size lancings 17 will hook behind the ledge 26 , while the small size lancings 16 will impact the free end 27 of the ledge 26 , thereby forcing the fabric 32 through the lancings 16 . The lancings are now supporting the fabric.
