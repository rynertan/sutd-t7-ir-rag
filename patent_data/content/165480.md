# Method of preparing acyloxybenzenesulfonic acids and salts thereof.

## Abstract
Alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts of acyloxybenzenesulfonate are prepared by sulfonating an aryl ester of an organic acid with gaseous sulfur trioxide to produce a sulfonation reaction mixture containing acyloxy benzenesulfonic acid, neutralizing the sulfonation reaction mixture with alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide to produce an alkali metal salt or alkaline earth metal salt of an acyloxybenzenesulfonic acid and thereafter recovering from the reaction mixture the acyloxybenzenesul fonic acid salt product thus formed.
