# A plug valve.

## Abstract
The plug valve comprises a valve body 1 presenting a cylindrical extension 3 provided with inner angularly equispaced longitudinal cogs 103 . Into the cylindrical extension 3 there is inserted a connector sleeve 6 provided on its outer surface with angularly equispaced longitudinal cogs, so that the connector sleeve 6 can be shifted axially but cannot rotate at the interior of the cylindrical extension 3 . The connector sleeve 6 thus inserted is axially blocked by means of a ring nut 7 which is screwed onto an external threading of the cylindrical extension 3 . The connector sleeve 6 carries at its inner end an annular packing 11 which is caused to adhere in a tight manner against the spherical plug 12 of the valve, while another similar annular packing 10 is housed in the valve body 1 , on the opposite side of the spherical plug 12 . The spherical plug 12 is rotated into its open or closed condition by means of a control stem 16 passing through a transverse bore 4 obtained in the valve body 1 and coupled to the spherical plug 12 by means of a groove and rib coupling 14, 15 .
