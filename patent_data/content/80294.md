# Pattern scanners.

## Abstract
A pattern scanner 1 comprises a plurality of light sensitive elements 23 guided in X and Y coordinate directions to scan a screen on which one or more pattern pieces are laid. The scanner detects outer and inner boundaries of the pieces, and analyses the inner boundaries to identify information such as grain direc tion, piece identity and drill holes.
