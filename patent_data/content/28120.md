# Connector lock release.

## Abstract
This specification discloses a locking structure for a pair of matable electrical connectors. The locking structure in cludes a latch assembly 31 formed on one of the connectors and a mating ramp 21 . The latch assembly includes integral locking 32 and lever 33 arms which coact with the ramp to permit locking and unlocking of the connectors. During locking of the connectors, the locking arm rides up the ramp member to insure proper mating of the connectors and then down a rear, vertical wall 24 . During unlocking of the connectors, the lever arm uses the ramp as fulcrum to raise the locking arm clear of the rear wall permitting movement of the locking arm over the ramp so that the connectors are easily unmated. The lever arm and the latch arm are connected at only one end thereby forming an elongated, generally V shaped opening 35 . This entrance is partially closed by a projecting guard 37 so that wires cannot enter between the lever arm and the lock ing arm and get stuck.
