# Field producing instrument for the electrotherapeutic selftreatment of pain and insomnia .

## Abstract
The instrument comprises a set of three plates 10 and 11, coplanar one with respect to the other and interspaced, the two outside ones 10 of which are connected to the nega tive pole of a current generator constituted by a microbat tery 13, while the one in the centre, namely plate 11, is con nected to the positive pole. The outside plates 10 and the central one 11 define electrodes made of metal of different characteristics, the former two zinc and the latter brass. In this way, two different electric fields are originated one at the surface due to the diversity in the nature of the electrodes and one deep seated due to the auxiliary genera tor 13.
