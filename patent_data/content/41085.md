It is found that particularly outstanding results, in terms of handleability, packaging, ease of manufacture, as well as maximum coverage and brilliance of chromium deposit accompanied by a minimum of lead anode corrosion may be obtained when in the compositions of Tables I, III, V, andVII, the organic carboxylic acid or halo organic acid is an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid and such compositions are most highly preferred, because of their peculiarly unexpected superiority. The baths of this invention which may be employed to readily and conveniently electrodeposit chromium plate, are characterized by high coverage and by high throwing power.These baths may be used to deposit chromium onto any basis metal.Outstanding results may be obtained when the basis metal is a metal having an atomic number of 24 30. Typical of such basis metals are chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc. Mixture or alloys of these metals may be plated typically brass, stainless steel, etc. The preferred basis metal may be nickel or a nickel iron alloy and preferably active nickel. The preferred active nickel basis metal may be attained by electrodeposition of nickel onto a suitable substrate metal such as iron . Active nickel may be nickel which is highly receptive to the deposition thereon of a bright clear decorative plate and which has a surface which may be free of nickel compounds such as oxide. Typically nickel may be active when freshly plated onto a cathode. If not already active, the nickel may be rendered active by cathodic or other reducing treatment prior to the deposition of chromium plate thereon. Preferably this may be effected by maintaining the nickel as cathode in an aqueous electrolyte solution, preferably containing an acid.The preferred acids for use in either electrolytic or non electrolytic techniques may include acids such as the common mineral acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid etc. When the aqueous electrolyte solution is other than acid, it may preferably be followed by an acid dip. It has been found when the high ratio baths of this invention are used to plate chromium onto bright nickel basis metal that it is advantageous to activate the bright nickel by applying to the cathode to be plated in the bath, a low voltage applied thereto at a time less than about five seconds after immersion and preferably to apply the voltage prior to immersion of the cathode. The low voltage may be sufficient to produce a cathode current density up to about 0.25 0.5 times the plating current density. Then the current density may be raised to its full operating value. This technique makes a bright nickel surface more receptive to the deposit of bright chromium from the baths of this invention. The bath may be preferably at temperature of 300 600C, say 350 500 C. A preferred cathode current density may be 0.3 40 amperes per square decimetre asd most preferably 0.5 20 asd. Plating may be carried out with air or mechanical agitation for any time to obtain a desired thickness, but for decorative plate it is usually h 10 minutes and typically one three minutes may suffice. During plating in accordance with the process of this invention, there is unexpectedly and surprisingly no appreciable loss of the organic carboxylic acid or halo organic acid by decomposition over extended periods of time. For example, in tests, 2,2 dichlorosuccinic acid was found still to function satisfactorily after plating had been carried out for 110 ampere hours per litre and even longer. At the conclusion of the plating time, the cathode will be found to be covered to a remarkable degree with clear, bright, decorative chromium plate. It is a particular feature of this invention that the plate is unexpectedly characterized by its high coverage without the need for conforming anodes.For example, articles containing deep recesses such as zinc based die cast automotive dashboard trim may be plated by the process of this invention with no conforming anode to unexpectedly yield a bright, uniform plate on both high and low current density areas. This has not heretofore been possible from such dilute baths. The plate produced by the process of this invention may be found to be highly satisfactory with respect to its unusually bright, decorative appearance and its resistance to corrosion. In the following series of illustrative examples, testing and the criteria for the deposits were established in a 534 ml Hull Cell containing 500 ml of solution. A brassHull Cell panel, 100 mm wide, was first plated with bright nickel, activated, rinsed and inserted in the test solution at the appropriate end. The solution was maintained at a temperature of 42.80 43.9 C and 5 amperes were passed through the test solution for three minutes, rinsed, dried and examined. Notations were made as to the distance in mm from the HCD end of each effect.Coverage is defined as this distance for the extent of chromium metal. Other temperatures of operation are also suitable so long as the appropriate adjustment in applied current is made.That is, higher temperatures of operation require higher currents to produce chromium deposits in the bright range and lower temperatures must utilize lesser currents. Optimum compositions, too, may be adjusted for changes in plating temperature e.g., the lower ratios may be more desirable at the elevated temperatures. In the following series of illustrative examples the stock bath and the plating conditions were the same as in the previous examples, except that electrodeposition was conducted at 430C. In the following tests the superior deposits obtained in this new region consist of typically bright chromium metal deposited from zero 0 mm i.e., the HCD edge of the test panel to at least 78 mm and this with only barely perceptible hazes or films on the deposit or even in the region beyond where the deposit ends e.g., 78 100 mm The combination containing only sulphate and fluoride i.e., without the carboxylate is inadequate to produce the desired results. This is borne out by several experimental sequences described below as Examples 1 4. In all cases the concentration of chromic acid was 120 g litre.
