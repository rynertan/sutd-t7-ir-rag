## Description
HEAT DEVELOPABLE MULTI LAYERED COLOR PHOTO SENSITIVE MATERIAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to a heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material and more particularly to a heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material in which a color contamination is improved. Description of the Prior Art With respect to the color photo sensitive materials using silver halide, there are well known processes such as a process using a dye formed by coupling the oxidant of a color developing agent to a coupler, another process a silver dye bleach process in which a dye is bleached by silver to obtain an image, or a further process being used in the so called instant photography, in which a dye released through an oxidation reduction reaction is diffused to transfer with an alkali treating liquid. To these photo sensitive materials have been applied with a wet process in which an image is formed by making use of an alkali or acid treating liquid. In recent years, in contrast with the wet processes, there have been developed simple and rapid processes using such a dry treatment as a heat treatment. Heat developable photo sensitive materials and the processes thereof are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,152,904, 3,301,678, 3,392,020 and 3,457,075 Research Disclosure,No. 17029, June, 1978, pp. 9 15 and the like. Among the processes of obtaining a color image through a heat development process, the processes of forming a color image through a coupling of the oxidant of a developing agent to a coupler are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,531,286, 3,761,270 and 4,021,240 Belgian Patent No. 802,519 and the like. In these processes, however, there is such a defect that a sharp and clear color image cannot be obtained because a silver image and a color image are produced at the same time. There has been introduced a process in which silver is bleached in a liquid process or with the use of an activator sheet so as to overcome the above mentioned defect.However, this process is not also preferable. On the other hand, there is known a process in which dyes are freed by a heat development with the use of a dye silver salt. In this process, a sharp and clear image cannot also be obtained because an exposed area and an unexposed area are hardly separated. A process of forming a color image by making use of leuco dyes is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,985,565 and 4,022,617, respectively. Wherein, however, it is difficult to incorporate the leuco dyes stably into a photographic material. This process has, therefore, a defect that a color is gradually tinted. Meanwhile, such a process that diffusible dyes are released by a heat development with the use of a reducible dye providing material and a reducing agent is described inJapanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 179840 1982 and 198458 1982, respectively, and another process is described inJapanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 186744 1982 and 207250 1982, respectively, in which a transfer image is obtained on an image receiving layer by coupling to the oxidant of a developer in place of the above mentioned reducible dye providing material and then releasing diffusible dyes from the coupling position. And, a further process is described inJapanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 149046 1983 in which dyes are formed by the oxidant of a developer and couplers and the dyes formed by heat are then transferred. These processes have been improved in various aspects.For example, in an improvement, color is not made turbid by a silver image and a color image is obtained in a simple operation because released dyes are heat transferred. In such a process as disclosed in the above mentionedJapanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 149046 1983, in which color forming dyes are heat transferred by making use of colorless biequivalent couplers, there is an advantage particularly in sensitivity among various photographic characteristics, because it is unnecessary to contain a colored color providing material in a heat developable photo sensitive layer. On the other hand, in an ordinary silver halide color photo sensitive material, it is well known that the component layers are multilayered. The typical examples of the layer arrangements include such an arrangement that is provided on a support in order from the support side with a silver halide panchromatic emulsion layer which is sensitive to red light, a silver halide orthochromatic emulsion layer sensitive to green light and, on the uppermost, a silver halide regular emulsion layer sensitive to blue light. In such a color photo sensitive material as mentioned above, the silver halide panchromatic emulsion and silver halide orthochromatic emulsion are spectrally sensitized by making use of such an optical sensitizer as usually called a sensitizing dye, and besides these spectrally sensitized layers, there is provided with the so called blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer having the inherent sensitivity of silver halide itself, that is also called a regular layer. In a color photo sensitive material being popularly used, a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer is arranged to the farthest position from a support to serve as the uppermost layer as described above, a color turbidity is caused by overlapping the spectra thereof. Accordingly, in the case of a negative photo sensitive material, for example, it is usual that the color turbidity is prevented from occurring by interposing a blue light absorbing filter layer between a blue serisitive silver halide emulsion layer and a green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer. As for the above mentioned blue light absorbing filter layers, these are used, a layer comprising silver colloids of the order of from 0.001 to 0.05 ism in the particle size, a layer containing such a dye stuff or a dye as flowed into a processing liquid in course of a developing process. Such a blue light absorbing filter layer as mentioned may therefore be present only when exposing or sensitizing a photo sensitive material to light, and if it still remains after completing a development process, an unnecessary absorption will be caused thereby, that is not desirable from the viewpoint of color reproduction. From this aspect, a silver colloidal layer is advantageous to an ordinary color negative development process because it can readily be removed in a bleaching or fixing step after completing the development process. If multilayered color layers are taken into consideration to arrange to such a heat development type color photo sensitive material as is relative to the invention, it is required to provided thereto with a blue light absorbing filter layer mentioned above. In a heat developable photo sensitive material, however, such a silver colloid layer as used in the above mentioned color negative photo sensitive material cannot be used. Because, in the case of a heat developable photo sensitive material, the silver colloid works as a physical developing nucleus for a heat development as it has the property of a physical developing nucleus, and a reducing agent is oxidized and an organic silver salt is then so reduced as to deposit a metallic silver on the colloidal silver. Resultantly, the oxidants of the reducing agent are diffused into the adjacent layer to cause an undesirable color formation, the increase in fogginess and the lowering of contrast. It is, therefore, not preferable to make the silver colloid layer serve as a blue light absorbing filter layer. Objects of the Invention It is the first object of the invention to provide a heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material in which color turbidity is improved. The second object of the invention is to provide a heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material in which fogs are rarely to be caused and the contrast is not lowered. The third object of the invention is to provide a heat developable multilayered color photo sensiLive material of diffusion transfer type in which a stain and contrast are improved. Summary of the Invention The above mentioned objects of the invention can be achieved with a heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material comprising a support having thereon a blue sensitive layer, a green sensitive layer and a red sensitive layer respectively containing at least one selected from a a light sensitive silver halide, b an organic silver salt, c a developer and, d a dye providing compound another substance may be contained , wherein a layer containing a diffusionproof blue light absorbing organic substance is interposed between said blue sensitive layer and said green sensitive layer or between said blue sensitive layer and said red sensitive layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It is preferred embodiment to contain all of a to b above mentioned in each light sensitive layer. It is preferred to provide a layer containing the blue light absorbing organic substance to the side of a blue sensitive emulsion layer opposite to the side thereof to be exposed to light when the photo sensitive material is exposed to light. In this case, the order of arranging a green sensitive layer and a red sensitive layer is not always fixed, but is allowed to arranged in reverse order. It is also allowed that only a blue sensitive layer is also used for a blue light absorbing filter layer as to a blue light absorbable organic substance that is a yellow dye releasing material. As for the hlue light absorbing organic substances to be used in the invention hereinafter called BAOS , the preferable thereof are those having an absorption property in a visible spectral range of from 400nm to 500nm. It is, further, preferred that they are not diffused to other layers when a photo sensitive layer is multilayered or preserved, and they do not stain any image when heat developing or heat transferring. The characteristics required for the above mentioned BAOS may somewhat become different in accordance with the conditions of a heat development process, a post processing made after the development process, or the like. As for the dye which does not stain the heat developed image if it is used for the heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material of the invention, either the one which is low in heat diffusibility to a binder, or the one which is rather high in heat diffusibility to the binder, but is decolorized by heat or light is cited. The one which is rather high in heat diffusibility, but has little affinity to the image receiving layer, and therefore does not substantially stain the layer is cited as well. The term, diffusionproof , of a BAOS means such a degree of diffusion that the BAOS may remain at the most in an adjacent layer even if the BAOS may move out of a layer containing the BAOS itself through a heat development is made at a usual heat developing temperature of from 1100C to 1700, and preferably it means such a degree of diffusion that theBAOS will remain in the layer containing the very BAOS. The measurement thereof may be made with the eye. On the other hand, the thickness of a photo sensitive layer to be used in a heat developable photo sensitive material of the invention is from ijim to 15um and preferably from 2pim to l0 m, and the thickness of a layer containing BAOS of the invention is from 0.5 m to l0 m and more preferably from lum to 5pom. When providing with other non photo sensitive layer, the thickness thereof is from 0.jim to 20pm and preferably from 0.3 m to 5 m. As for dyes which are decolorized by heat or light, descriptions have been made, for example, in U.S. PatentNos. 3,745,009 3,769,019 3,615,432 3,821,001 4,088,497 4,197,131 4,260,676 and 4,283,487. However, since such dyes, even though some use of decolorizable color may be available, cannot always prevent the image receiving layer from staining according to treating conditions, then, as further preferableBAOS, those which do not diffuse into the image receiving layer because the low heat diffusibiliLy are cited. As for the BAOS to be used in the invention, the preferable thereof are those each having a maximum absorption in a range of from 400nm to 500nm. And, as for the BAOS which are not diffused to other layers when a photo sensitive layer is multilayered or preserved, and are low in heat diffusibility in a binder during heat developing. It is preferable that the molecule of such BAOS has at least one hydrophilic group selected from the group consisting of sulfo, carboxy, sulfino, sulfeno, thiosulfo, dithiosulfo, hydroxysulfonyloxy, hydroxysulfonylthio, thiocarboxy, carboxyimido, hydrazoic acid, carbohydrazoic acid, hydroxime acid, carbohydroxime acid, hydroxame acid, carbohydroxame acid, sulfinimide acid, sulfonimide acid, sulfinohydroxime acid, sulfonohydroxime acid, and sulfamoyl group.Among these hydrophilic group, a sulfo, sulfino, sulfeno, thiosulfo, dithiosulfo, hydroxysulfonyloxy, hydroxysulfonylthio, carboxy and thiocarboxy group are preferable and a sulfo group and a carboxy group are especially preferable. On the other hand, as for the substances for lowering the diffusibility in a binder, a BAOS having a ballast group is given as an example. Such a preferable BAOS includes those having a large molecular ballast group which are, for example, hydrophobic groups such as a straight or branched alkyl group having not less than 8 carbon atoms, a group containing the above mentioned alkyl group, an aryl group having a straight or branched alkyl group having not less than 4 carbon atoms and a group containing the above mentioned aryl group. The ballast groups are satisfactorily useful if they have 30 carbon atoms. In addition, BOAS having a hydrophobic or hydrophilic chain polymer are preferable in the invention. In this invention, when comparing the above mentioned dyes having a hydrophilic group with the dyes having a ballast group, the latter is preferable, and the dyes having both of the hydrophilic group and a highly hydrophobic ballast group are more preferable. The alkyl group having not less than 8 carbon atoms may be either one of the straight chained or the branch chained, and preferable ones have not more than 30 carbon atoms, and more preferable ones have not more than 27 carbon atoms. They include, for example, an n octyl group, a tert octyl group, an n dodecyl group, an n octadecyl group and the like. As for the groups each containing the alkyl group, there may be given as the examples, an alkoxy group such as dodecyloxy group, an alkylthio group such as dodecylthio group, an alkylsulfonyl group, an alkylamide group such as ,dodecyloxyvarbonylpropioamide group and 2,4 di tert amylphenoxyacetamide group, a palmitoylamide group, a dodecylcarbamoyl group, an n octadecyl succinimide group and the like. The alkyl groups useful in the invention shall not be limited thereto. The groups each containing an aryl group having an alkyl group having not less than 4 carbon atoms include, for example, an aryloxy group substituted by an alkyl group having not less than 4 carbon atoms, and such an arylamide group as 3 palmitoylamidobenzamide group, substituted thereof. The groups useful in the invention shall not be limited thereto. As for the BAOS to be used in the invention, those having an absorption in a visible spectral range of 400nm to 500nm are arbitrarily selected out of generally known dyes including azo dyes, azomethyne dyes, cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, oxonol dyes, styryl dyes, and the like.

The temperatures for a polymerization process are normally within the range of from 300C to 120 C, though it is necessary to take the kinds of the polymerization starting agents and the solvents into consideration. As for the polymerization starting agents to be used in the emulsification polymerization process or the solution polymerization process for preparing a blue light absorbing dye polymer of this invention, there include the following ones As for a water soluble polymerization starting agent, there include, for example, a persulfate such as potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, sodium persulfate and the like a water soluble azo compound such as 4,4 azobis 4 sodium cyanovalerate, 2,2 azobis 2 amidinopropane chloride and the like and hydrogen peroxide.

Next, how to synthesize a blue light absorbing dye polymer of the invention will be described. Generally speaking blue light absorbing dye polymers of the invention are synthesized in the following two processes 1 Synthesis of blue light absorbing dye compound having an ethylene unsaturated group or an ethylene unsaturated group polymerization. 2 The polymerization reaction product Dye coloring through the introduction of a chromophore e.g., a diazo coupling reaction . Some of the synthesis examples of the blue light absorbing dye polymers of the invention will be described below o Synthesis Example l Synthesis of PM 10 Synthesis of Copolymer PM 10 of 1 2,4,6 trichloro phenyl 3 methacryloylamino 4 4 cyanophenylazo 5 pyrazolone and butyl acrylate A solution was prepared by dissolving 40g of 1 2,4,6 tri chlorophenyl 3 amino 4 4 cyanophenylazo 5 pyrazolone and 24g of pyridine into 800my of acetonitrile and the resulting solution was cooled to 50C and stirred. Whereinto, a solution prepared by dissolving 13g of methacrylic acid chloride into 100ml of acetonitrile was dropped.The resulting solution was stirred for 30 minutes of room temperature and was then poured into a chloric acid solution 0.5N , and the resulting crystals were filtrated.

Further, l.3g of azobisisobutylonitrile were added thereto and stirred for two hours at 80 C. The resulting mixture was poured into 5 of water and was filtrated. Then, 95g of Polymer PM 10 were obtained. The weight average molecular weight thereof Mw was 11,000. o Synthesis Example 2 Synthesis of PM 1 Synthesis of Copolymer PM 1 of 1 phenyl 3 methacrylic acid amide 4 4 methoxyphenylazo 5 pyrazolone and butyl acrylate A solution was prepared by dissolving 50g of 1 phenyl 3 methacrylic acid amide 4 amino 5 pyrazolone into 500my of dioxane at 80 C.

Further, 1.3g of azobisisobutylonitrile were added therein and were then stirred for two hours at 80 C. The resulting mixture was poured into 5L of water and the resulting polymers were filtrated. Then, 95g of Polymer A were obtained. Next, a mixture was prepared by mixing 18g of p methoxy aniline, 32m1 of concentrated chloric acid and 450ml of water.The resulting solution was cooled to 00C and was then dropped therein with a solution of 10.5g of sodium nitrite disslolved in 60m1 of water. The resulting solution was stirred for 30 minutes at 00C was. A solution of a diazonium salt was thus obtained. Meanwhile, 73g the above described Polymer A were mixed together with 450my of water, 450my of DMF and 27g of sodium hydroxide, and the resulting mixture was cooled and kept at a temperature of not higher than 10 C. Then, the aforementioned solution of a diazonium salt was dropped there into and thereafter the resulting solution was stirred for one hour at room temperature. The resulting mixture was poured into a chloric acid solution 0.lN , and 88g of Polymer PM 1 were obtained. The weight average molecular weight Mw was 8,500. It is preferred that the molecular weight of a blue light absorbing dye polymer of the invention is within the range of from 1,500 to 100,000 in term of weight average molecular weight mew According to the invention, such dyes as above cited are contained by a layer interposed between a blue sensitive layer and a green sensitive layer, or between a blue sensitive layer and a red sensitive layer. However, the dyes are ordinarily contained by the layer interposed between the blue sensitive layer and the green sensitive layer as shown in the following layer arrangement. Typical layer arrangement a Support b Red sensitive heat developable photo sensitive layer. c Green sensitive heat developable photo sensitive layer. d Layer containing blue light absorbing dyes. e Blue sensitive heat developable photo sensitive layer. Such a layer arrangement as shown above sometimes has, in addition, various other layers hereinafter called intermediate layer interposed between the above layers for various specific purposes. In a heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material, the red sensitive heat developable photo sensitive layer is composed of red sensitive silver halide, an organic silver salt, a developer, a cyan dye providing compound, and a binder. Similarly, the green sensitive heat developable photo sensitive layer is composed of green sensitive silver halide, an organic silver salt, a developer, a magenta dye providing compound, and a binder. The blue sensitive heat developable photo sensitive layer is composed of blue sensitive silver halide, an organic silver salt, a developer, a yellow dye providing compound, and a binder. A heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material of the invention which is arranged in such a way as described above, releases and forms dyes in course of a heat developing process, and transfers the dyes onto an image receiving layer. In this case, it is necessary to cut off the blue light from the green sensitive layer and the red sensitive layer because both layers are sensitive also to the inherent sensitive range 400nm to 500nm . The above layer containingBAOS functions effectively for this purpose. Because the BAOS of the invention have not only the property of effectively absorbing the blue light but also an excellent diffusion resistance as aforementioned, diffusion of the BAOS into farther layers than adjacent layer is prevented substantially. Therefore, not only any fogginess or lowering of contrast, but also any stain are not caused. The above BAOS relevant to the invention are applied ranging from 0.01g m2 to 10g m2, preferably from 0.05g m2 to 1.5g m2. They can be added to the blue light absorbing layer of the heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material by various means according to their structure and properties. As for such means, for example, there are the method that the BAOS, together with a binder are dissolved in a certain solvent, and ground with the use of a ball mill, the protect dispersing method that a dispersion is made with the use of a high boiling point solvent or its combination with a low boiling point solvent, similarly to the case of dispersion of ordinary couplers, and the Fischer dispersing method that the BAOS are dissolved in a alkaline solution, and then dispersed into a hydrophilic binder. Particularly, as for the processes which may be applied to contain a blue light absorbing dye polymer of the invention in the photographic component layers of a heat developable color photo sensitive material, there are such a process as a latex dispersion process in which the polymers of the invention may be contained in the component layer in such a manner that the polymers are dissolved in a low boiling solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate or the like, or a high boiling solvent such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, tricresyl phosphate, or the like and the resulted solution is then dispersed by ultrasonic waves a process in which an polymers are dissolved in an aqueous alkali solution such as an aqueous solution of 108 sodium hydroxide or the like and the resulted solution is neutralizing by a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid or the like or a process in which the polymers are dispersed together with an aqueous solution of a suitable polymer such as polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, or the like, by making use of a ball mill. Any blue light absorbing dye polymer of the invention may be used independently or in combination. The amount thereof to be used is not limited but may be depended upon the kinds of the polymers or whether they are to be used independently or in combination with two or more of them. For example, an amount to be used is from 0.01g to lOg and preferably from 0.05g to l.5g per square meter of a support. The photo sensitive silver halide to be used in the invention include, for example, silver chloride, silver bromide, silver iodide, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodide, silver iodobromide, silver chloroiodobromide, and the like. These photo sensitive silver halide can be prepared in such an arbitrary process in the photographic technical field as a single jet process, a double jet process and the like. In the invention, the desired results are obtained with the use of photo sensitive silver halide emulsions containing a photo sensitive silver halide prepared in accordance with an ordinary preparation process of a silver halide gelatin emulsion. They have particle size ranging from 0.Olpm to 1.0cm, preferably from 0.05 m to 0.spam. The shape of the silver halide particle is allowed to be a regular tetrahedron, regular octahedron, or tetradecahedron, but preferably has at least 1, 1, 1 faces. The particle is allowed to be of core shell type that the interior and exterior ports are different than each other in halogen composition. Such photo sensitive silver halide emulsions may preferably be chemically sensitized in an arbitrary process used in the photographic technical field. As for such sensitizing processes, there are various processes including, for example, a gold, platinum or palladium sensitization, a sulphur sensitization, a gold sulphur sensitization, a reduction sensitization, and the like, which may be applied independently or in combination. The photo sensitive silver halide emulsions prepared as mentioned above can be most preferably applied to a heat developable photo sensitive layer that is a component layer of the photo sensitive materials of this invention. As for a process of preparing the other photo sensitive silver halide, it is possible, in this invention, to form a photo sensitive silver halide in a portion of an organic silver salt by making a photo sensitive silver salt forming component co exist with an organic silver salt which will be described later.As for the photo sensitive silver salt forming components to be used in this preparing process, an inorganic halide may be given as the example thereof, including, for example a halide represented by MXn in which M represents hydrogen, E4 group or a metal atom, X represents Cl, Br or I and n is 1 when the M is hydrogen or NH4 group, and when M is a metal atom, n is the valence thereof, and the metal atoms include those of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cecium, copper, gold, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, zinc, cadmium, mercury, aluminum, indium, lanthanum, ruthenium, thallium, germanium, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, chromium, molybdenum, wolfram, manganese, rhenium, iron, cobalt, nickel, rhodium, paradium, osmium, iridium, platinum, cerium a halide containing metal complex, such as K2PtC16, K2PtBr6, 4 4 2 rC16, NH4 3 Irk16, NH4 2 Rut16, NH4 3 RuCl6, NH4 3 RhC16, NH4 3 RhBr6 an onium halide e.g., a quantanary ammonium halide such as tetramethylammonium bromide, trimethylphenylammonium bromide, cetylethyldimethylammonium bromide, 3 methylazolium bromide and trimethylbenzylammonium bromide a quartanary phosphonium halide, e.g., tetraethylphosphonium bromide a tertiary sulfonium halide, e.g., benzylethylmethylsulfonium bromide and l ethylthiazolium bromide a halogen substituted hydrocarbon, e.g., iodoform, bromeform, carbontetrachloride and 2 bromo 2 methylpropan anN halogen compound, e.g., N chlorosuccinimide, N bromosuccinimide, N bromophthalimide, N bromoacetamide,N iodosuccinimide, N bromophthaladinone, N chlorophthaladinone,N bromoacetanilide, N,N dibromobenzensulfonamide, N bromo N methylbenzensulphonamide and 1,3 dibromo 4,4 dimethyl hydantoin and the other halogen containing compounds, e.g., triphenylmethyl chloride, triphenylmethylbromide, 2 bromolactic acid, and 2 bromoethanol. These photo sensitive silver halide and the photo sensitive silver salt forming components may be used in combination in various processes. A preferable amount used thereof is from O.OOlg to 50g per sq. meter, and a more preferable amount is from 0.lug to lOg per sq. meter. The heat developable color photo sensitive materials may also comprise each of blue light sensitive, green light sensitive and red light sensitive layers, namely, a multiple layer comprising a heat developable blue light sensitive layer, a heat developable green light sensitive layer and a red light sensitive layer, and the same light sensitive layer thereof may be divided into two or more layers such as a high sensitive layer and a low sensitive layer. Each of the blue light sensitive silver halide emulsion, green light sensitive silver halide emulsion and red light silver halide emulsion to be used in the above mentioned case may be prepared by adding various kinds of spectral sensitization dyes to the silver halide emulsions. It is preferred that the spectral sensitization is made by making use of a sensitizing dye. The spectral sensitization dyes which may typically be used in this invention include, for example, cyanine, merocyanine, a trinuclear or tetranuclear complex cyanine, holopolar cyanine, styryl, hemicyanine, oxonole and the like.Among the cyanine dyes, those each having a basic nucleus such as thiazoline, oxazoline, pyrroline, pyridine, oxazole, thiazole, selenazole, and imidazole are preferred to use. Such a nucleus may have an enamine group capable of producing an alkyl group, alkylene group, hydroxyalkyl group, sulfalkyl group, carboxyalkyl group, aminalkyl group, or a condensed carbocyclic or heterocyclic color ring. Also, it may be in the symmetric or unsymmetric form, and the methine chain or the polymethine chain thereof may have an alkyl group, a phenyl group, an enamine group, a heterocyclic substituent. The merocyanine dyes may also have, for example, such an acid nucleus as a thiohydantoin nucleus, a rhodanine nucleus, an oxazolyl acid nucleus, a thiazolinethione nucleus, a malononitrile nucleus, and a pyrazolone nucleus. These acid nuclei may also be substituted by either of an alkyl, alkylene, phenyl, carboxyalkyl, sulfalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxyalkyl or alkylamine group, or a heterocylic ring nucleus. If required, these dyes may further be used in combination. It is still further possible to jointly use such a supersensitive additive incapable of absorbing any visible rays of light as an ascorbic acid derivative, an azaindene cadmium salt, an organic sulfonic acid and the like including, for example, those described inU.S. Patent Nos. 2,933,390, and 2,937,089. The amount of these dyes to be added is from 1 x 10 4 mole to 1 mole per mol of a silver halide or a silver halide forming component, and rore preferably, from 1 x 10 4 mole to 1 x 10 1 mole. In the heat developable color photo sensitive materials of the invention, various kinds of organic silver salts may be used if required for increasing the sensitivity and improving the developability of the materials.

In addition, the compound to be used as the mordant afore mentioned also is applied on an appropriate support singly or in combination with another polymer. For a heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material of the invention, various exposing means are applicable. The latent image is obtained with image exposure to a radiation including visible rays. Generally, light sources for the ordinary color printing such as a tungsten lamp, mercury lamp, xenon lamp, laser, CRT and LED are available as light source. As original drawings, not only line drawing images such as draftings but also gradational photographic images are applicable. Printing from an original drawing may be done through contact printing as well. Further, it is possible that images which are cast by a video camera or the like, and image information which is transmitted from a TV station are directly produced by CRT orOFT, and that such images are formed on a heat developable photo sensitive material by means of contact or lens. Further, LEDs which have been markedly improved in recent years, are being used as exposing or displaying means in various instruments. However, it is difficult to obtain an LED which emits the blue light effectively. For the purpose of reproducing a color image, it may be useful that a system is designed so that LEDs may emit the green light, the red light, and the infrared radiation, respectively, and layers which are sensitive to such lights and radiation, may provide yellow, magenta, and cyan dyes, respectively. That is, the green , red and infrared sensitive layers may be to contain yellow, magenta, and cyan dye providing compounds, respectively. Besides the above method of direct contacting or casting of the original drawing, there is a method that the original drawing is read by a light receiving element such a phototube and CCD, and inputted into a memory of a computer or the like, and that such information is image treated at need, reproduced by CRT, and then utilized as a image like light source, or, on the basis of the treated information, the three LEDs are made to emit and expose. The heat transfer from a heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material of the invention to an image receiving layer element for heat transfer is conducted when the heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material of the invention is heat developed or is reheated after the completion of the heat development. Heating for heat transfer may be conducted making use of any means applicable to ordinal heat developable photo sensitive materials. For example, it may be useful to make the material contact with a heated block or blade, to make use of high frequency heating, and further to provide a conductive layer within the heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material of the invention, or within the image receiving layer element , and ultilize Joule heat generated by conduction or an intensive magnetic field therefrom.As for the heating pattern, there is no special limitation, but it is possible to reheat after preheating, to heat for a short time at high temperature or for a long time at low temperature, including continuously raising or lowering the temperature, repeatedly if necessary, or to heat discontinuously. However, certain simple heating patterns are preferable. Usually, the heating termperature for heat transfer ranges from 800C to 200 C, preferably from 1000C to 180 C, and the heating time ranges from 1 second to 5 minutes, preferably from 5 seconds to 3 minutes. In heat transfer with the use of a heat developable multilayered color photo sensitive material, most of heat developing apparatuses on the market for example, Image Forming Model 4634 Sony Techtronics , DeveloperModule 277 3M , and Video Hard Copy Unit NWZ 301 JapanRadio are readily applicable.
