# A method of forming an ion implanted gallium arsenide device.

## Abstract
A silicon layer 16 , preferably 10 to 1000 nm thick, is used as a capping layer during the annealing of an ion implanted gallium arsenide substrate 12, 14 . After the annealing, the silicon capping layer can be removed by means of a fluoride based etchant. The silicon cap prevents out diffusion of arsenic from the GaAs, and has a coefficient of thermal expansion which is sufficiently close to that of the GaAs to inhibit the formation of cracks in the capping layer.
