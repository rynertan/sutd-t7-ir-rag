# Improvements in scroll type fluid compressors.

## Abstract
A scroll type fluid compressor unit including a housing having a fluid inlet port and fluid outlet port and a fixed and orbiting scroll member within the housing. Each scroll member has an end plate 281, 301 and a spiral element 282, 302 which are maintained angularly and radially offset so that both spiral elements interfit with line contacts between the spiral curved surfaces to define moving sealed off pockets. A thrust supporting means 39, 371 is engaged with a side surface of a portion of the orbiting scroll member for provid ing axial thrust support. An axial pushing means such as a spring biased rod 40 is engaged with the orbiting scroll member for pushing the orbiting scroll member against the thrust supporting means from the side of the orbiting scroll member which faces the fixed scroll member, so that axial slant of the orbiting scroll member is minimized.
