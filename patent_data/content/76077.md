# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO HEAT EXCHANGERS

## Abstract
A heat sink for use with a fluid containing garment and comprising a thermoelectric module array adapted to be connected to a suitable power source, a fluid duct in thermally conducting association with the cold junctions of the array, a gas duct in thermally conducting association with the hot junctions of the array and a fan for causing gas to pass in the gas duct, the fluid duct being adapted for connection to a fluid conditioning garment. The heat sink may incorporate a fluid pump, perhaps in tandem with the fan, for pumping fluid through the fluid duct.
