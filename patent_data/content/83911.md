# Hydro pneumatic shock absorber with separate tank for suspensions, in particular for engine powered means of transportation provided with two or three wheels.

## Abstract
The shock absorber is provided with a tank 10 separate there from, which an appropriate type of diaphragm divides into two parts, namely a lower part C₁ in which oil is contained and an upper part C₂ in which gas under pressure is contained, the regulation of the value of which can determine differences in the loads and characteristics of the shock absorber. The connection between the body 5 of the shock absorber containing the oil and the lower part of the said separate tank is achieved through two separate pipes, namely a supply pipe 15 and a return pipe 16, the purpose of which is to alllow the oil to circulate. The separation diaphragm 14 is virtually flat and of a large area so as to undergo minimum oscillation and consequently last longer.

## Description
Hydro pnenstic shock absorber with separate tank for sus pensions, in particular for engine powered means of trans portation provided with two or three wheels The fundamental element utilized in a suspension, that is to say the group of parts hose task it is to connect el astically the wheels of a vehicle to the supporting struct ure thereof, is certainly constituted by the shock absor ber, in other words the device designed to limit and dam pen oscillation phenomena that has got into the said el astic system.Amongst the various types of shock absorbers already in existence, reference is made in particular herein to fluid friction shock absorbers schematically constituted by a double cylinder and by a piston which, stressed by the im pact effected, forces a fluid iass oil to pass through very narrow apertures and thereby generate friction thus the kinetic compression energy is converted, through friction, into heat.Recently what are called hydro pneumatic shock absorbers have come on the market and these, based virtually on the principle outlined above, are provided, inside the chamber filled with oil, with an additional small second chamber, separated from the former by a diaphragm, in which gas under pressure is contained in this way it is possible to absorb variations in volume as a consequence of rod oscillations and volume variations due to the thermal ef fect of the oil.In order not to lessen, compatibly with the dimensions of the shock absorber, the volume of the liquid, and consequently its characteristics and efficiency, the said sec ond chamber has been transferred, illa later version of the said hydro pneumatic shock absorbers, from the inside to the outside thereof, housed in a lateral and piece.This method has caused increases in the overall dimensions of the shock absorbers that are not always suited to the spaces available, and this is particularly so in the case of the wore sophisticated types of engine powered means of transportation provided with two or three wheels.On account of the foregoing, the said second chamber has recently been made separate frog the body of the shock ab sorber, connected thereto by aeazls of a flexible tube, so that it be possible to position the said tank wherever most suitable.The problem with this niethod is that since it is vainly used on vehicles where the shock absorber undergoes heavy, troublesome stress, due to the oil contained tank being heated very greatly, the characteristics of the fluid deteriorate all of a sudden until, within a very short space of tine, the shock absorber loses its efficiency complete ly on account of the effect the high temperature has on the viscosity of the oil and the precocious ageing of the components utilized that are not made of metal, The cause can certainly be attributed to the high tempe ature that the shock absorber is not able to dissipate since the separate tank gives no help at all because of there being between it and the body of the shock absorber, an oil connection only able to absorb variations in volume, not oil circulation.A further problem arises because of the aforementioned diaphragm genarally being in the form of a cloged pudding basin subjected to constant oscilation, in which breakage phenomena can occur. The essential object of the invention consists, therefore, in making available a shock absorber of the hydro pneumatic type having a separate tank for containing the chamber in which the gas is present, which maintains constant its characteristics and efficiency even in the presence of high, critical conditions of operation by virtue of the temperature of the oil being kept within limited and controlled values. Another object consists in making available a diaphragm for separating the liquid from the gas so shaped as to reduce to a iinii the possibility of breakage point init iation and thus consequentially to increase the life span of the shock absorber.These and other objects too are all attained with the hydro neumstic shock absorber according to the invention, constituted by a rod with piston able to slide guided in the inside of a corresponding cylinder filled with liquid, and provided with a separate tank divided, by means of a suitable diaphragm, into two parts, namely a lower part in which the said liquid is contained, and an upper part in which pressurized gas is contained, wherein there are two separate pipes for connecting the said lower chamber of the said tank with the said cylinder, that is to say, one pipe for supplying and one pipe for returning the said liquid, with non return valves being placed in the said pipes so as to determine the circulation of the said li quid in me single direction.Further characteristics and advantages of the shock ab sorber forming the subject of the invention will become wore apparent from the detailed description that follows, illustrated purely as an unlimited example on the aocompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a view of the shock absorber in quest ion with its component parts Figures 2 and 3 show, in an enlarged scale, details of the non return valves utilized in the connection pipes Figure 4 shows, in a plan view, the tank separation diaphragm Figure 5 shows, in a lateral view from A in Figure 1, the tank with certain parts removed in order that others say become more apparent.With reference to the accompanying figures, ghom globally at 1 is the shock absorber element that virtually eonsists of a rod 2 at one extremity of which there is a first ele vent 3 for fastening it to a novable part of the suspen sion, and at the other, a piston 4 that slides hernetical ly in the inside of a cylinder or body 5 of a kno n type, filled with oil 6, the passing of which through the out flow ports provided determines a damping effect on the os cillations generated by an elastic element 7 that exerts an effect between the rod and the body, the latter being connected, through a second fastening element 8, to the fixed part of the suspension or vice versa . At 10 is shown a tank for the oil, separate from the shock absorber 1, which is constituted see Figure 5 by two halves of a box, 11 and 12, respectively, of shell conformation, the internal volume of which is centrally divided, in the region of the plane of symmetry, by a diaphragm 14 that acts as an element for separating the lower chamber Ci, filled with oil, from the upper chamber C2, filled with pressur ized gas. The lower amber of the said tank 10 is then placed in communication with the body 5 of the shock absorber 1 via two separate pipes, namely a pipe 15 for supplying oil from the body of the shock absorber, and a pipe 16 for returning the oil thereto. For this to be achieved, that is to say in order that the circulation of the liquid in one single direction be possible, two non return valves, 15 in Figure 2 and 16 in Figure 3, of a known type provided with a ball S and a spring X, are placed along the said pipes, in particular at the inlet to and at the out let from the said tank.As stated, the upper chamber C2 is placed under pressure through the insertion of gas generally air therein by leans of a valve V of a known type. In this connection, the diaphrag is shaped in an opportune fashion, as shown in Figure 5, 50 that the air intake be kept separate frol the oil inlet and outlet ports. This method thus enables the oil to circulate along the circuit formed by the said shock absorber 1, the separate tank 10, the supply pipe 15 and the return pipe 16, the said circulation being realized by the oscillations of the rod 2, that is to say through the constant pumping effect of the piston 4 on the oil 6 inside the body 5.In cidentally, in order that the oil arriving inside the body 5 be not sent immediately towards the outgoing pipe 15, it is good policy to place inside the said body one or sore baffles, the purpose of which is to guarantee a con stant and possibly total change of oil inside the said body. This calls for continuous cooling of the oil all the part of the tank 10 which, suitably finned, in this way acts not only as a separate oil gas surge chamber but also as a heat elimination radiator, which is a hilly im portant finiction since by keeping the oil within acceptable temperatures, the characteristics of viscosity of the oil are maintained and thus so are the operating characteris tics of the shock absorber . Likewise, the characteris tics are conserved of the non metal parts gaskets, etoet era that are liable to suddenly deteriorate at high tem peratures and are thus responsible for the factions of the entire shock absorber undergoing a complete loss of efficiency. Above all, the tank 10 maintains the surge chamber funct ion without having necessarily to be in the vicinity of the shock absorber body. One fttther observation is in respect of the particular flat shape of the diaphragm which, in virtue of the considerable area thereof, permits the diaphragm to oscillate very briefly and, above all, prevents the initiation of breakage points due to deformation concentrations.In the practical embodinent thereof, the invention can al so adopt forms that differ from that outlined above and, in particular, numerous modifications of a practical nature may be nade thereto without any deviation from the framework of protection afforded to the invention.
