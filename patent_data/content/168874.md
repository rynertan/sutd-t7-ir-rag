# Electric incandescent lamp.

## Abstract
The electric incandescent lamp has a filament 12 con nected to current supply conductors 3a, 3b 4a, 4b and kept taut by a frame of longitudinal conductors 8, 9 and trans verse insulators 10, 11 . The conductors 8,9 are each con nected to a point on the current supply conductors 3a, 3b 4a, 4b at least one of them being connected thereto through a fuse 18, 19 . When switching on and operating the lamp, the fuses 18, 19 are not included in the current circuit. When a discharge arc is produced between fragments of the filament 12 , this arc flashes over to the conductors 8, 9 and the fuses 18, 19 are included in the current circuit in order to interrupt the current.
