## Description
ANIMAL SLAUGHTERING APPARATUS WITH ITS CARTRIDGE FEEDER ADVANCEDAUTOMATICALLY, SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE RESETTING OF THE FIRING PINFor animal slaughtering, pistols are used in which an explosive cartridge causes the instantaneous, temporary emergence of a solid or bollow cylindrical steel spike from the barrel, which perforates the forehead bone of the animal and damages its brain, so killing it.After firing, said spike is returned to its position within the barrel by suitable elastic means.The known apparatus are generally of the single loading type, in the sense that after each firing operation the breech block has to be opened in order to insert a new cartridge into the relative explosion chamber, and the firing pin then reset for subsequent use of the apparatus.This obviously prevents immediate reutilisation of the apparatus for firing a second shot in order to effectively kill the animal without unnecessary suffering or delay, should the first shot not have produced a lethal effect.A type of automatically loaded apparatus for abbatoirs has already been proposed, using a cartridge strip feeder which is advanced stepwise in order to move the cartridges into the explosion chamber in succession after each firing of the apparatus. Such an apparatus is however very complicated from both the constructional and operational viewpoints. This is because the means provided for advancing the feeder are separate from those used for the resetting, andSthey are operated separately at different times.The loading operation and resetting operation are carried out separately, the former by rotating a protection sleeve provided at the end of the barrel in order to release it, this simultaneously opening the breech block, and the latter by moving the firing pin into a position in which it is engaged by a release lever controlled by the trigger, after closing the breech block and returning the protection sleeve into its initial position.These operations are laborious and uncomfortable to carry out, and there is nothing to prevent the firing pin becoming inadvertently reset before the feeder has been advanced, so that it is possible for the firing pin to become accidentally and uncontrollably released to fire the cartridge by operating the apparatus when the next cartridge is loaded into the explosion chamber.The present patent relates to an animal slaughtering apparatus in accordance with claim 1, and has the object of proposing an abbatoir apparatus in which the loading of the cartridge into the explosion chamber and the resetting of the firing pin are effected simultaneously, by means of a single operation, and consequent on the opening and closure of the apparatus breech block.A further object of the patent is to provide an abbatoir apparatus of particularly simple and functional structure, which allows simple and immediate setting up for use and thus repetitive utilisation of the apparatus.One embodiment of the apparatus according to the present patent is described hereinafter by way of non limiting example with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal section through the apparatus in the position ready for resetting after firing a cartridge Figure 2 is a partial section through the apparatus in the resetting stage, with particular reference to the means for engaging the striker element with the firing pin Figure 3 is a vertical section through the apparatus on a plane different from that of Figure 2, in order to show the means for advancing the cartridge feeder andFigures 4 and 5 are the same sectional views of the apparatus as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, but with the apparatus now ready for firing.As stated heretofore, the apparatus is of the automatic loading type and uses a cartridge strip feeder 1 designed to advance stepwise so that each of its cartridges 2 is moved progressively into alignment with the apparatus explosion chamber 3.Said apparatus comprises a body 4 with a barrel 5 in which a slaughtering spike 6 is guided to move positively forwards by the action of the gas produced by firing the cartridge 2 in the explosion chamber 3, and is returned in the opposite direction by a return spring 7 which also acts as a shock absorber in association with buffer elements 8, 9.In order at any given time to fire a respective cartridge 2, there is provided a firing pin 10 which is struck by a striker element 11 in the form of a spring loaded plunger, both being mounted on a breech block 12 which is mobile axially in order to close the explosion chamber 3 and lock the cartridge 2 therein during firing, to then open the explosion chamber in order to extract the cartridge case.The strip feeder 1, which extends vertically through the grip of the apparatus, is guided in the front part of the breech block 12, and there is connected to said breech block 12 a toggle joint lever 13 for manually moving this latter from the closed position to the open position together with said feeder.In particular, the lever 13, pivoted at 130, can rotate backwards through 1800 Figure 2 and, by means of the connecting rod 131 pivoted at 132 to the lever 13 and at 133 to the breech block 12, drag this latter into the open position.When in this position Figure 2 the striker element 11 for the firing pin 10 is engaged in the set state by an engagement lever 14 controlled by a trigger 15 by way of a release lever 16, which causes the release of the striker element for firing purposes.On the breech block 12 there is also mounted Figure 3 and Figure 5 , pivoted at 17, a rocker lever 18 having a first arm 18 connected at 19 to a thrust pawl 20 designed to engage with the strip feeder 1 in order to advance it, and a second arm 18tut cooperating with a stationary cam 21 provided in the apparatus body in order to cause said rocker lever 18 to move angularly and advance the feeder through one step by the action of the pawl 20 when the breech block 12 is moved from the closed position to the open position, said pawl engaging in holes or slots provided in said feeder.Figure 4 shows the apparatus ready for use. When in this state, the breech block 12 has been moved into the position in which it closes the explosion chamber in order to lock a cartridge 2 therein, and the striker element 11 is locked in the set position by the engagement lever 14, the spike 6 having been moved into its inactive position within the apparatus barrel.In addition, when the apparatus is in this state the rocker lever 18 has been moved away from the barrel 21, so that the thrust pawl 20 has been moved downwards with respect to the feeder as shown inFigure 5, by the effect of a return spring. It is now necessary only to grip the apparatus and operate the trigger 15 in order to use it for slaughtering an animal by means of the spike 6. In this respect, the striker element 11 becomes released and acts on the firing pin 10 to fire the cartridge 2 and thus operate said spike 6.After the cartridge 2 has been fired by the apparatus, this latter returns to the state shown in Figure 1, ready for resetting and reuse.For resetting, it is necessary only to operate the toggle joint lever 13 in order to move the breech block 12 backwards, this simultaneously moving the feeder 1. By means of this single operation on the breech block, the striker element 11 becomes reset and the feeder 1 becomes advanced through one step simultaneously. In this respect, when the breech block is moved backwards as shown in Figure 2, the striker element 11 is engaged and locked by the engagement lever 14, which thus sets it.At the same time, the rocker lever 18, on moving with the breech block 2, encounters the cam 21 by way of its arm 18 , and is therefore obliged to rotate and to cause the feeder 1 to be advanced through one step by means of the thrust pawl 20, in order to remove the fired cartridge case 2 and to dispose a new cartridge 2 in line with the explosion chamber 3 as shown in Figure 3. On then closing the breech block 12, the striker element 11 remains set ready to act on the firing pin, and the new cartridge becomes inserted into the explosion chamber, thus restoring the state shown in Figures 4 and 5, for immediate use of the apparatus.
