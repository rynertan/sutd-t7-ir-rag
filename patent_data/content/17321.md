## Description
This invention relates to a starter motor, for use on an internal combustion engine, the starter motor being of the kind including an electric motor having a rotor shaft, a lay shaft carrying a pinion gear wheel, the lay shaft being spaced from the rotor shaft and being driven thereby, and means whereby the lay shaft can be moved transverse to its longitudinal axis relative to the rotor shaft to move the pinion gear wheel into and out of driving engagement with the ring gear of an engine. Starter motors of the kind specified have been known for some years and although not widely used such motors have found applications in small capacity engines such for example as motor cycle engi nes. A problem found with starter motors of the kind specified is that of controlling the depth of meshing betwee n the pinion gear wheel and the Ping engine ring gear. Gear teeth on meshing gears are a designed to engage atjpredetermined region of the tooth profile, for example in the region of the pitch circle diameter of the teeth. In a known starter motor the depth of meashing is controlled by abutment of a stop member on the frame of the starter motor with a part of the means for moving the lay shaft.Such a mode of controlling meshing depth can prove unsatisfactory inter alia in that inaccuracies can arise as a result of tolerance build up in the assembly of the starter motor, inaccuracies in the positioning of the starter motor relative to the engine ring gear and as a result of wear. It is an object of the present invention to produce a starter motor of the kind specified wherein the aforementioned disadvantages are minimised. According to the invention in a starter motor of the kind specified there is provided, adjacent the pinion gear wheel, a circular cylindrical surface which is coaxial with the pinion gear wheel and has a diameter equal to the pitch circle diameter of the pinion gear wheel said surface in use during operation of the starter motor abutting a corresponding circular cylindrical surface adjacent the ring gear, said corresponding surface being coaxial with the ring gear and being of diameter equal to the pitch circle diameter of the ring gear. Desirably the surface is a surface of a part integral with the pinion gear wheel. The invention further resides in an internal combustion engine incorporating a starter motor as specified in anyone of the two preceding paragraphs, and having a ring gear and adjacent the ring gear a circular cylindrical surface coaxial with the ring gear and of a diameter equal to the pitch circle diameter of the ring gear. Convenien tly said surface is a surface of a part integral with the ring gear. One example of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a diagrammatic part sectional view of a starter motor Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1, with the section taken in a plane at right angles to the section of Figure 1, and Figure 3 is a diagrammatic end view of the starter motor shown in Figure 1. Referring to the drawings, the starter motor includes a body 11 housing an electric motor 12 including a rotor shaft 13. Pivotally mounted on the body 11 by way of bear ,fo ings 44 and 45, movement about an axis co incident with the axis 14 of the rotor shaft 13 is a lay shaft carrier 15 the lay shaft carrier 15 supporting a lay shaft 16 having its axis parallel to and spaced from the axis 14. Rotatable on the lay shaft 16 is a drive sleeve 17 the end of which furthest from the motor 12 is shaped to define a pinion gear wheel 18. At its end remote from the pinion gear wheel 18 the sleeve 17 supports a uni directional clutch assembly 19 the outer, drive input member 21 of which is cylindrical having its axis coincident with the axis of the shaft 16 and which is formed on its outer surface with gear teeth. The gear teeth of the member 21 are permanently in mesh with gear teeth of a gear wheel 22 carried at the free end of the rotor shaft 13. Thus when the motor 12 is energised the shaft 13 rotates and the gear wheel 22 drives the outer, drive input member 21 of the uni directional clutch 19. The clutch 19 is so arranged that it transmits the normal rotational movement of the shaft 13 to the sleeve 17 50 that the pinion gear wheel 18 is caused to rotate.Clearly the gear wheel 18 rotates in the opposite direction to the shaft 13, and at a speed determined by the rotational speed of the shaft 13 and the effective gear ratio of the pinion gear wheel 22 and the outer member of the clutch 19. In the event that the sleeve 17 is rotated in the same direction as it will be driven by the shaft 13, but at a speed greater than that which is till be driven by the shaft 13, then the clutch 19 over runs so that the sleeve 17 cannot drive the motor 12. In use the starter motor is positioned with the axis 14 parallel to the axis of rotation of the flywheel of the engine. It will be recognised that it is normal for a starter motor to drive an internal combustion engine for starting purposes, by having its output pinion gear wheel in mesh with a ring gear on the flywheel of the engine. The pinion gear wheel. 18 is normally held clear of the ring gear 24 of the flywheel 23, but can be moved tranverse to its rotational axis in an drcuate path about the axis 14 by movement of the carrier 15 about the axis 14, to engage the pinion gear wheel 18 with the ring gear 24. An electromagnet arrangement 25 is supported on the body 11 of the starter motor, and is provided for the purpose of moving the carrier 15, lay shaft 16 and sleeve 18 about the axis 14 to engage the pinion gear wheel 18 with the ring gear 24 in use. The electromagnet is positioned with its axis parallel to the axis 14 and comprises a toroidal electromagnet winding 26 having a push rod 27 extending along the axis thereof. Adjacent the end of the winding 26 is a fixed electromagnet pole 28 through which the rod 27 extends.Slidable towards and away from the pole 28 within the winding 26 is an electromagnet armature 29 which is coupled to the rod 27 by means of a compression spring 31 whereby the armature 29 can move relative to the winding 26 even if the rod 27 is held against movement. A movable electrical contact 32 is supported on an electrically insulated carrier 33 in turn supported on the electromagnet armature 29. The contact 32 is engageable with a pair of fixed contacts 34 to complete an electrical circuit therebetween. The end of the push rod 27 remote from the armature 29 co operates with one limb of a bell crank lever 35 the other limb 36 of which terminates in a part spherical member 37. The bell crank lever 35 is pivotally mounted on the body 11 and is urged by a compression spring 38 to pivot relative to the body 11 in a direction to move the armature 29 away from the pole 28 counter clockwise in Figure 2, . The part spherical member 37 of the limb 36 is received in a yoke 41 secured to the lay shaft 16. Thus when the bell crank lever 35 is caused to pivot relative to the body 11 the co operation between the member 37 and the yoke 41 causes movement of the lay shaft assembly including the carrier 15 about the axis 14. The spring 38 acting on the bell crank lever 35 urges the lay shaft assembly to pimt relative to the body 11 in a direction to withdraw the pinion gear wheel 18 radially from the ring gear 24. It is to be recognised that the accompanying drawings all show the starter motor in an operated condition, that is to say with the pinion gear wheel 18 in meshing engagement with the ring gear 24. Intermediate the ring gear 18 and the clutch 19 the sleeve 17 is formed with a region 42 having a circular cylindrical outer surface the axis of which is coincident with the axis of the pinion gear wheel 18. The diameter of the cylindrical surface of the region 42 is equal to the pitch circle diameter of the teeth of the pinion gear wheel 18. The flywheel 23 is provided adjacent the ring gear 24 , with a region 43 having a circular cylindrical outer surface the axis of which is coincident with the axis of the ring gear 24. The diameter of the cylindrical surface of the region 43 is equal to the pitch circle diameter of the gear teeth of the ring gear 24, and the region 43 is positioned. axially with respect to the ring gear 24 so as to be aligned with the region 42 on the sleeve 17.It will be recognised therefore, that when the lay shaft assembly of the starter motors moved relative to the body 11 about the axis 14 to move the pinion gear wheel 18 into engagement with the ring gear 24 then the depth by which the teeth of the pinion gear wheel 18 and the teeth of the ring gear 24 mesh is limited by abutment of the cylindrical surface of the region 42 with the cylindrical surface of the region 43. Since the diameters of. the surface of the regions 42 and 43 are equal to the pitch circle diameter of their respective sets of ge ar teeth then the meshing of the ring gear 24 with the pinion gear wheel 18 will take place with their pitch circles touching this being the ideal meshing arrangement for tne form of gear teeth used on the pinion gear wheel 18 and the ring gear 24. The operation of the starter motor is as follows.Assuming that the starter motor is at rest, then the pinion gear wheel 18 will be spaced radially from the ring gear 24.When the driver of the vehicle attempts to start the vehicle closure of the starter switch will energise the electromagnet winding 26 but not the electric motor 12.The armature 29 will be attracted magnetically towards the pole 28 and thus will move axially to the left in Figure 2 taking the push rod 27 with it. he push rod 27 will thus cause the bell crank lever 35 to pivot against the action of the spring 38 clockwise in Figure 2 and the co operation between the member 37 and the yoke 41 will pivot the lay shaft assembly about the axis 14 to bring the pinion gear wheel 18 into engagement with the ring gear 24.Assuming that the teeth of the pinion gear wheel 18 and the ring gear 24 mesh cleanly then fractionally before the surface of the region 42 abuts the surface of the region 43 the moving contact 32 moving with the armature 29 will engage and bridge the fixed contacts 34 thereby completing the energising circuit of the electric motor 12. The armature 29 will continue to move, and the gear wheel 18 will be moved into full meshing engagement with the ring gear 24, at which point its movement will be arrested by abutment of the surface of the region 42 with the surface of the region 43. During this later movement of the armature 29 the armature 29 will move relative t o the contact 32 and contact carrier 33 as permitted by collapse of a compression spring 33a.Thus this additional movement of the armature 29 ensures that the contact 32 is firmly urged, by the compression spring 33a, into engagement with the contact 34. In the event that the teeth of the pinion gear wheel 18 meet the teeth of the ring gear 24 in tooth to tooth abutment then the pivoting movement of the lay shaft assembly will be arrested, thus arresting movement of the bell crank lever 35 and the push rod 27. However, the armature 29 will continue to move as permitted by compression of the spring 31 which links the armature 29 to the push rod 27. Thus a position of the armature 29 where the contact 32 bridges the contact 34 will still be reached, and the motor will be en ergised. Initial rotation of the rotor shaft 13 and therefore the pinion gear wheel 18 will immediately disturb the tooth to tooth relationship, permitting the teeth of the pinion gear wheel 18 and ring gear 24 to mesh.The lay shaft assembly will rapidly be moved about the axis 14 to achieve full meshing immediately the tooth to tooth condition is broken by the combined action of the spring 31 and the driving torque of the now driven pinion gear wheel engaging the substantially stationary ring gear which effectively pulls the pinion gear wheel into mesh with the ring gear. It will be recognised therefore that the force generated by the electromagnet must be sufficient to overcome the combined action of the springs 31, 33a, 38.Furthermore, it will be recognised that the spring 31 must be of greater strength than the spring 38 so that normally the spring 31 acts as a solid spacer and is only compressed in the event of a tooth to tooth abutment condition. When the pinion gear wheel 18 and ring gear 24 are fully meshed, and the motor 12 is operating then the motor will drive the engine by way of the flywheel 23. This operation is known as cranking . Immediately the engine fires, it is probable that the flywheel 23 will be driving the pinion 18 at a speed greater than that which it is being driven by the motor. 12 and the clutch 19 will then over run so that the engine does not drive the electric motor 12. When the driver of the vehicle releases the starter switch, the starter switch will return to its open condition thus de energising the electromagnet winding 26. The res toring action of the spring 38 will thu s return the lay shaft assembly, the bell crank lever 35, and rod 27 and the arm ature 29 to their original rest positions during which movement the movable contact 32 will be disengaged from the fixed contacts 34 thus de energising the motor 12. It will be recognised that the sleeve 17 is formed from hardened and tempered material, since the teeth of the pinion gear wheel 18 are integral therewith. Thus it is convenient to form the region 42 integral with the pinion gear wheel.However, in the example described above and illustrated in the drawings the ring gear 24 is an annuls of hardened and tempered material secured to the periphery of the flywheel 23 whereas the region 43 is integral with the flywheel 23. In some applications, for example where the flywheel 23 is formed from a relatively soft material perhaps in order to achieve a relatively light weight fly wheel then it may be preferable to provide the region 43 as an integral part of the hardened metal annulus forming the ring gear 24. Conversely, in some circumstances it may be preferable to provide the ring gear 24 and the region 43 as integral parts of the flywheel 23. It is known that when two gear wheels mesh and are rotating then a force is generated tending to part the gear wheels. In order to overcome this problem the line of action of the gear wheels is arranged to pass the axis 14 at a spacing X Figure 3 such that a torque is generated to impress upon the carrier 15 a load greater than the parting load so tending to keep the gear wheels in mesh. This load is accepted by the surfaces 42, 43 which, being of the pitch circle diameter of their respective gear wheels will have no speed difference and therefore no slippage at their interface. It is the torque generated by the spacing Z of the line of action of the gear wheels from the nazis 1 T hich eids the spring 31 in causing the. pinion gear heel to mesh with the ring gear immediately a tooth to tooth abutment condition has been removed. It will be recognised that if desired the electromagnet arrangement 25 could have its axis at right angles to the axis 14 with the armature 2a acting di.ectly on the carrier 41, the bell crank lever 35 being dispensed with.
