## Description
PROCESS FOR BRA2INGThe invention relates to a brazing process in which two structures are joined together with a gold rich brazing solder.In the manufacture of electronic systems, one step involves the brazing of electrical connection pins to metal pads on electronic chips. A braze material commonly used for this bonding is composed of 80 20 AulSn. During a typical manufacturing process, a device may be heated and reheated 10 or 15 times, or perhaps even more, as additional chips are joined to a substrate and as corrections, repairs and engineering changes are made to the device. Each time one of these reheating, or reflow steps is performed, all existing brazed joints will be reheated to some extent. This reheating of existing brazed joints can result in degradation of the metallurgy of the braze joint. This reduces the strength of the joint and can lead to pins tilting or even falling off entirely during handling of the substrate.The object of the invention is to provide a brazing process with which joints are formed that remain intact even if subjected to one or several heating cycles.This object is achieved by a process as indicated at the beginning of this specification, using the feature of the characterizing part of claim 1.Using the inventive process, the melting temperature of the resulting brazed joint is raised to a temperature that is substantially above the melting temperature of the brazing solder which has been used initially to make the joint. Thus, the resulting joint will be far less likely to be affected by subsequent ref lows. The invention has two essential elements the particular metal added to the braze solder and the manner in which it is added We have discovered that, especially in a process in which a gold rich brazing solder is used, the preferred metal to add is copper. Copper exhibits substantial advantages over all other alternatives that we have investigated. We have also discovered that the best way to add the copper is to provide it in the form of a film.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of our invention, the copper film is provided by plating it onto one of the Surfaces to be joined.In accordance with another embodiment of the inveniton, the copper film is provided by a copper preform which may be used in conjunction with braze solder preforms. The invenitive method is particularly useful for joining chips to a substrate in the manufacturing of electronic systems.Preferably the amount of copper provided is sufficient to provide an amount of copper equal to approximately seven percent by weight of the metal in the resulting braze joint.The invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 shows a fragment of a multilayered cera mic substrate having a connecting pad that is to be brazed to a pin in accor dance with this invention.Fig. 2 shows details of a braze joint structure after brazing in accordance with the in vention. Fig. 3 is similar to Fig. 1 but showing an al ternative embodiment of the invention.Fig. 1 shows a portion of a multi layered ceramic substrate carrying a molybdenum Mo pad which is conventionally protected with a layer of nickel Ni approximately 3 Sm thick.On top of the Ni is a film approximately 1 4 pm of gold Au . Also shown in Fig. 1, ready to be brazed to the pad is an electrical connecting pin constructed primarily ofKovar coated with a film of palladium Pd approximately 4 Mm thick on which another film of Au approximately a 1 4 pm thick is also used. In order to join the pin to the pad, an 80 20 Au Sn brazing solder is also provided.Everything described in the preceding paragraph is completely conventional in processes for bonding pins to pads. The additional feature shown in Fig. 1, in accordance with our invention, is the layer of copper Cu , preferably approximately 8 pm in thickness, that is plated onto the top of theMo Ni Au pad. The layer of Cu can have been plated onto the pad by, for example, evaporation or electrodeposition or any other manner known to those skilled in the art.Brazing of the pin to the pad with the 80 20 Au Sn brazing solder then proceed exactly as it would have if the additional Cu layer had not been provided. When the brazing solder and the surfaces to be joined are heated to above approximately 280 C the liquidus point for the eutectic 80 20 alloy the brazing solder melts and the copper diffuses through the AuZSn brazing solder to form a ternary Au Sn Cu alloy. The copper diffuses through the rest of the brazing solder so quickly that the diffusion goes to completion in a time that is quite short with respect to the brazing cycle. Perhaps a matter of just a few seconds.Upon cooling, there will be a resulting brazed joint which, because of the addition of theCu, has a solidus point of approximately 350 C, in contrast to the temperature of 280 C that was required in order to form the joint in the first place. Thus, subsequent ref lows involving the substrate which might heat this joint to as much as approximately 350 0C will not affect the integrity of this brazed joint.The structure of the resulting brazed joint is shown inFig. 2. Above the surface of the pad there will remain someCu that is bonded to the upper layers of the pad. Above theCu is the braze joint itself that is substantially comprised of Au, Sn and Cu. Laboratory analyses of brazed joints prepared in accordance with the invention have shown the joint to be comprised substantially of a Cu Au Sn alloy approximately 70 of the joint , a Au Sn alloy approximately 25 of the joint and a Au Sn Pd Ni alloy approximately 5 of the joint . The latter alloy is a result of the migration of Pd and Ni from the pin and the pad into the brazed joint.The following table depicts further details of the brazed joint. The table shows the percent by weight of metals found, by laboratory analysis, within various portions of the brazed joint. Fox each portion, two sets of figures are given. The first set of figures show the percentages of various Au Sn Cu Au Sn Au Sn Pd Ni Bulk 70 25 5 100 As B 15Rf As B 15Rf As B 15Rf As B 15RfAu 77.4 79.6 61.3 61.9 27.9 32.2 70.0 71.9Sn 8.9 10.9 37.1 36.4 44.8 41.9 20.2 19.1Cu 14.5 11.4 0.4 0.4 2.7 2.1 7.0 6.4Pd 0.4 0.1 0.6 0.2 13.5 16.3 1.6 1.1Ni 0.1 0.0 0.1 0.0 10.7 6.6 0.3 0.15 metals within a joint as brazed As B that is, immediately after brazing.The second set of figures shows the composition of a joint after 15 reflows 15of at approximately 350 Or. The most significant point shown by the table is that the brazed joint is quite stable throughout a large number of reflows . Differences between the first and second sets of figures are partly attributable to C1 measuring accuracies, and .2 the face that the first and second sets were from measurements on different braze joints. One other important point is illustrated by the table. It is significant to note that the total bulk of the brazed joint contains approximately 7 Cu. For this reason, in preferred embodiments of the invention, a sufficient amount of Cu is provided so that there will be enough Cu to form at least 7 by weight of the final brazed joint.A preferred way of providing a sufficient amount of copper is to provide a copper film that is approximately 1 8 the thickness of the Au Sn brazing solder. Note that one feature of this invention is that the precise amount of copper provided is not critical, so long as enough is provided. As is illustrated in Fig. 2, any excess copper that is, copper that is not alloyed into the braze joint itself simply forms a smooth transition from one surface to the brazed joint. From the pad to the pin, all transitions are smooth and homogeneous. As is further illNLrated by the diagram ofFig. 2, the use of this method results in a joint with substantially no intermetallics and minimal voids. As is known to those skilled in the art, the presence of intermetallics and voids in a brazed joint are substantial contributors to joint failure.Referring now to Fig. 3, an alternative embodiment of the invention is illustrated. Fig. 3 again depicts a pin g that is to be joined to a pad 2. However, this time the brazing material comprises two layers 3 and 4 of 80 20 Au Sn, one of which is placed in contact with pin I and the other of which is in contact with pad 2. In accordance with this alternative embodiment of our invention, intermediate the two layers of Au Sn is an additional layer of Cu 5. When brazing takes place the additional layer of Cu 5 will diffuse through the brazed joint in the same manner as has been described above.In the preceding descriptions of preferred embodiments of the invention, examples were used of a pin and a pad having, respectively, a Pd Au surface and a Ni Au surface. However, it should be recognized that the surface upon which theCu is placed can be any surface to which the Cu can be bonded metallurgically or even mechanically. Also, although we have described a process using Au Sn solder, it will be recognized that other gold rich solders, such as for example, Au In could also be used.Although, as has been noted above although we prefer to electroplate the copper onto one of the surfaces to be joined, those skilled in the art will recognize that many other appropriate methods for placing the copper on the surface can be used.Another advantage of our invention which will be clear from the above description is that although it adds a step to existing processes for brazing items together, the added step providing a film. of Cu does not affect the other steps in an existing brazing process. Also of significance is the fact that a common Au Sn braze, with which those skilled in the art are quite familiar, can be used without alteration.
