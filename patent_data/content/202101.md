# Vibrating element for ultrasonic atomization.

## Abstract
A vibrating element 1A for the ultrasonic atomization of liquid is formed around a periphery with edges A, B, C, D, E over which a film of the liquid flows, to be atomized at each edge. To improve the spray quantity and avoid stagnation of liquid between adjacent edges and to enhance the drainability of the element when cutting off the spray, the edged portion 2A of the element is formed by continuously curged surfaces R1, R2, R3, R4 connecting adjacent edges. Alternatively, steps formed between adjacent edges may be rounded in the corners.
