# Method for heat treatment of clay and refractory ware.

## Abstract
In order to facilitate oxidation of oxidisable material typically carbonaceous contained in refractory or clay ware during the firing of the ware in a tunnel kiln 12 , commercially pure oxygen is introduced through the lances 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 into the region of the kiln where such oxidation takes place. This oxygen is directed into channels 44, 38 and 46 between stacks of ware 37 and 34, 34 and 36, and 36 and 39 for the time being adjacent the lances and carried by kiln cars 40, 32 and 42 . The ware is advanced through the kiln 12 on the kiln cars in the opposite direction to the direction 48 of air flow through the kiln. The oxygen from the lances penetrates the stacks and thereby enriches in oxygen the air contained between individual items of ware in the stacks. The oxygen is typically added to the kiln at regions whose temperature is in the range 750 to 850 C, and the flow of air through the kiln chosen to depress the oxygen concentration of the kiln atmosphere in carbonaceous material present at 600 C to the temperature range 750 to 850 C.
