## Description
Tert butyl gamma dimethylamino beta hydroxy butyrate and process for its preparationThe present invention relates to the novel chemical compound norcarnitine tert butyl ester and to a process for its preparation.Norcarnitine tert butyl ester tert butyl gamma dimethylamino beta hydroxy butyrate EMI1.1 is a useful intermediate for the preparation of carnitine and of carnitine derivatives such as, for example, acetyl carnitate of carnitine dichloride. The latter is a novel derivative of carnitine, whose chemico physical characteristics and processes for preparation thereof are described in the Italian patent application 48503 A 84 filed onJuly 4, 1984 by the same applicant under the title Ester of acetyl carnitine, processes for its preparation and phar maceutical compositions containing it Norcarnitine tert butyl ester is prepared according to the following reaction scheme EMI2.1 The process of the present invention, however, is characterized by the sole step IV , V since the preceding stepsEMI2.2 andEMI2.3 are already known and described in the literatureIn fact, the intermediate II may be synthesized as described in J.A.C.S. 58 , 2450, 1936, while the intermediates III and IV may be synthesized as described inJ. Pharm. Science 64 , 1262, 1975. More particularly, the process for the preparation of norcarnitine tert butyl ester V according to the aboveshown reaction scheme comprises the steps of a condensing crotonic acid I with thionyl chloride thereby obtaining crotyl chloride II b reacting crotyl chloride II with tert butanol, in the presence of an acid acceptor thereby obtaining tert butyl venylacetate III c epoxidizing tert butyl vinylacetate III with m chloroperbenzoic acid thereby obtaining the correspond ing epoxy IV steps a , b and c being carried out according to known processes, and it is characterized, according to the present invention, by the steps of d reacting a solution of the epoxy IV in lower alkanol with a solution of dimethylamine in lower alkanol, in a molar ratio IV dimethylamine comprised between 1 0.9 and 1 1.5, keeping the reaction mixture at about 5 300C for about 3 8 hours in an inert gas atmosphere, thereby obtaining V e isolating V from the reaction mixture of step d by concentrating the mixture under vacuum and treating the residue with a water immiscible solvent, extracting with a diluted acid solution and then alkalizing to a pH of about 12 and re extracting with an organic solvent, anhydrizing the resulting organic phase and removing the organic solvent by distillation under reduced pressure.Preferably, the lower alkanol of step d is methanol the water immiscible organic solvent of step e is ethyl ether or ethyl acetate.As alreadymentioned, compound V is for example useful for the preparation of carnitine. At first sight it could seem that for preparing carnitine it is not necessary to start from compound V , but that it suffices to react the epoxy IV directly with trimethylamine In contrast to what might seem obvious, the reaction does not prodeed in the desired direction see J. Org. Chem. 1980 45 , 2763 2766 . It is therefore necessary to react the compound V with methyl iodide and to hydrolize the ester.Example a Preparation of crotyl chloride J.A.C.S. 58 , 2450, 1936 EMI4.1 A mixture of 100 g of crotonic acid 1.163 mol and 350 ml of SOCK2 was ref fluxed in a 1 liter round bottomed threenecked flask under mechanical stirring, until evolution of hydrochloric acid came to an end about 6 hours .

There were then added 680 mg of Me2NH in MeOH 5.9 mmol. and the temper ature was allowed to rise to 250C, while stirring was continued for 3 hours. The solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure, the oil obtained was dissolved in 6 ml of ethyl ether and then extracted 3 times with 2 ml cold 5 HCl. The extract was brought to pH 12 with NaOH and the basic solution was extracted 3 times with 3 ml of ethyl acetate, which was then washed with 2 ml H20.
