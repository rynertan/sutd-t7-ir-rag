# A structure having a movable panel.

## Abstract
Means are provided for allowing movement of a mov able panel 5 between a flush fitting plane and a non flush plane, and for allowing lateral movement of the panel 5 in the non flush plane. Part spherical rollers 2a or rod 16 or a carrier 12 having rollers 13 or ballrace abutments 15 engaging with a track 1a of part circular cross section provide means for allowing the movable panel 5 to tilt during transfer between planes. Thus one end of the movable panel 5 may be transferred between planes before the opposite end, enabling one person to handle large panels with ease. The need for large internal frames is obviated.
