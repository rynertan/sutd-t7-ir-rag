# Vehicular body for hauling hot slag and other materials.

## Abstract
A vehicular body 10 for hauling materials, comprising an external skeletal frame 20 of metal members forming the primary load bearing structure of the body a metal lining 80 supported by the skeletal frame 20 and forming the interior surfaces of the body 10 for containing loads of material, the exterior surface of the lining being exposed to the ambient atmosphere through the openings in the skeletal frame 20 and coupling means securing the lining 80 to the skeletal frame 20 while permitting relative movement between the lining and the frame so that the lining and the frame can expand and contract differentially without stres sing each other. The lining 80 of the vehicular body can be detachably coupled to the skeletal frame 20 to facilitate removal of the lining for maintenance or replacement purposes.
