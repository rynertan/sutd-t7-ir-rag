# LOW SURFACE RECOMBINATION EFFECT SEMI CONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
A semi conductor device having proper means for con centrating current injection in the central part of the emitter and eliminating the surface recombination effect is shown and described. In one apparatus there is a contact located in the central region of the emitter and a second contact located in the peripheral region of the emitter to provide a bias voltage between the central region and the peripheral region of the emitter. In another apparatus, current injection reduction at the periphery is produced by the difference in diffusion poten tials of the materials chosen for the emitter and base compo nents of the semi conductor device.
