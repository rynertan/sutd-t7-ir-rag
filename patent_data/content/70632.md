# RECOMBINANT PLASMIDS ENCODED FOR HUMAN PREPROINSULIN AND THEIR USE IN PRODUCING HUMAN INSULIN

## Abstract
Recombinant plasmids are described that carry the structural gene for human proinsulin in expressible form enabling for the first time production of human proinsu lin by the application of genetic engineerng techniques using a single host organism. The human proinsulin structu ral gene is fused to a functional transport sequence. Host organisms transformed by the recombinant plasmids ex press a preproinsulin product that may, depending upon the nature of the host, be correctly processed to human proinsu lin in vivo and transported across the host organism s cell wall. Alternatively, expressed human preproinsulin may be recovered from host cells and converted into human proin sulin. Following its preparation in vitro method may be used to convert the human proinsulin to human insulin.
