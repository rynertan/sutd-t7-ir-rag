# Formation of solid polymeric material.

## Abstract
A solid flexible polymeric material is formed by solidify ing a water based latex which contains an inorganic filler. The filler is sand and this may be stabilised in the latex with xanthan gum. The solid material may be a foamed or non foamed layer which may be used as integral carpet backing, as carpet underlay, or as an adhesive for bonding a reinforcing fabric to the back of carpeting.
