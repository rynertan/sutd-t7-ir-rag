# Temperature scanner.

## Abstract
A temperature scanner for use in a hot strip rolling mill to enable ready determination and analysis of the temperature distribution over a hot strip of material passing through said mill. The temperature scanner comprises a photocell scanner unit 1, situated over and scanning a strip 2 perpendicular to its direction of travel, electronic analysis means 6 connected to said scanner unit via lead 5 and display means 7 connected to the analysis means 6 by lead 8. The analysis means 6 compares the temperatures detected with a reference level and together with the display means 7 displays a map of the strip surface in which areas at temperatures above the reference level are distinguished from those below the reference level. Alternatively, one or more scans of the surface are displayed, in which temperatures above the reference level are distinguished from those below the reference level.
