# Variable reluctance motor with reduced torque ripple.

## Abstract
A variable reluctance motor 20 having tapered stator teeth 31 and more rotor teeth 39 than stator teeth. The width of the stator and rotor teeth provides a relatively high rotor tooth ratio and a relatively low stator tooth ratio. With this configuration the motor 20 has very low torque ripple. Magnetic saturation is limited to the tips 38 of the stator teeth 31 , so the motor 20 can be operated at current levels above the saturation point, producing a linear torque to cur rent function and high output torque.
