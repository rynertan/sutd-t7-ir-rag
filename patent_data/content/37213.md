# Conversion of synthesis gas into hydrocarbons rich in linear alpha olefins.

## Abstract
Hydrocarbons rich in linear alpha olefins are produced by contacting synthesis gas at elevated temperatures with a ZSM 5 type zeolite which is substantially catalytically inert and which contains within its pores a carbon oxide reducing component, for example a Fischer Tropsch type catalyst such as iron, cobalt or ruthenium.
