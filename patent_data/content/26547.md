## Description
Process for the preparation of basic salts of alkaline earth metals and basic salts obtained by this process.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the preparation of compositions which are catalytically active for the preparation of condensation reaction products of an epoxide and organic compounds having an active hydrogen with a restricted molecular weight distribution and reduced by products. A variety of products such as surfactants, functional fluids, glycol ethers, polyols, and the like are co nercially prepared by the condensation reaction of epoxides with organic compounds having an active hydrogen, generally in the presence of an alkaline or acidic catalyst. The types of products prepared and properties thereof depend on the active hydrogen compound, the epoxide, and the number of moles of epoxide employed as well as the catalyst, a mixture of condensation products species being obtained containing different molecular proportions of epoxide. Thus, the reaction products generally obtained have a wide range of molecular weights and of molecular distribution of the epoxide units. It is generally desirable to restrict the molecular distribution of the mixture to adjacent analogues of the desired product, insofar as possible, but this is quite difficult to control. Acidic catalysts tend to give a narrower molecular distribution than alkaline catalysts, but also contribute to the formation of undesired by products.Thus, alkaline catalysts are generally used as the more efficient type of catalyst,but the molecular distribution in the resulting products are more diffuse. Heretofore, several methods have been suggested for providing reaction products of an active hydrogen compound and epoxides having a narrower range of molecular weights and molecular distribution of the epoxide units, or which reduce or eliminate the production of undesirable poly ethylene glycol and cyclic and straight chain ether by products. For example, in U.S. Patent 4,112,231 toWeibull et al. it is disclqsed that the use of certain neutral inorganic fluoborate and per chlorate salts will catalyze the reaction of epoxides with active hydrogen compounds to give products having a narrower molecular distribution and a larger proportion of desired species inU.S.Patent No. 3,682,849 to Smith et al improved ethoxylated derivatives of C11 C18 alcohols are prepared by removing unreacted alcohol and lower ethoxylates from the conventionally produced ethoxylate mixture using vapor phase separation techniques in U.S. Patent 2,870,220 to Carter, a two stage process is disclosed for preparing monoalkyl ethers of ethylene glycol and polyethylene glycols of more restricted molecular weight range wherein an alkanol and ethylene oxide are reacted in the presence of an acidic catalyst during the first stage and then in the second stage, after removal of acid catalyst and reacted alkanol, reacting the mixture with ethylene oxide in the presence of an alkali metal alcoholate of the initial alkanol and in U.K.Patent 1,501,327 to Laemmle et al is disclosed a method of preparing mono and poly glycol ethers substantially free of undesired alkylene glycols by products which involves heating a reaction mixture containing an alkylene oxide and an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst containing alkali or alkaline earth cations wherein some or all of the catalyst is an anhydrous high boiling liquid residue prepared by concentrating the liquid residue left from the same or different etherification process after removal of the glycol ether product from the reaction mixture. There has also been suggested basic compounds of alkali and alkaline earth metals that have been used, for example, in the polymerization of alkaline oxides see U.S.Patent 3,100,750 to Bailey, Jr. et al. and the preparation of nonionic surfactants having special properties see U.S.Patent 4,134,854 to Milligan . To the best of our knowledge, however, none of the processes or special catalysts disclosed in the art are completely satisfactory in that they require multi stage procedures or special acidresistant equipment, give undesirable by products or simply do not provide sufficient control over the molecular weight distribution. It would be highly desirable, therefore, to develop a process for the preparation of compositions which are catalytically active in the reaction of an epoxide with an organic compound having an active hydrogen wherein such reaction could be more readily carried out to prepare products that have a narrow molecular weight distribution of anologue species and contain only small amounts, at most, of undesirable by products. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Various soluble basic salts of alkaline earth metals have been described in our copending applicationSerial No. as being effective catalysts for the preparation of condensation reaction products of an epoxide and an organic compound having an active hydrogen compound. The instant invention is directed to the novel method for the preparation of a class of catalysts which are extremely effective for the preparation of oxyalkylation reaction products having a narrower molecular weight distribution and reduced amount of undesirable by products. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of soluble basic salts of alkaline earth metals that are catalytically active in the oxyalkylation reaction of alcohols, polyols and phenols which comprises reacting an alkaline earth metal material selected from the group consisting of calcium, strontium, and barium and mixtures of the same with a lower monohydric aliphatic alcohol having 1 to 7 carbon atoms at a temperature at which the reaction proceeds to form a lower alcohol metal alkoxide mixing a polyol or a higher monohydric alcohol having at least 4 carbon atoms with the lower alcoholalkaline earth metal alkoxide reaction product and removing the lower alcohol from the reaction mixture of higher alcohol or polyol and lower alcohol metal alkoxide. It has been discovered that the basic salts of alkaline earth metals herein described not only catalyze the reaction of a monohydric alcohol, polyol, or alkyl phenol and an epoxide but also favor a narrower molecular distribution, i.e., a more limited range of molecular species and a larger proportion of the desired species in the reaction product. Moreover, the oxyalkylation reaction can be carried out in a single stage without the need for special acidresistant equipment and the products produced thereby have been found, in general, to contain only small amounts of undesired poly alkylene glycol and ether by products. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the process of the invention an alkaline earth metal material selected from the group consisting of calcium, strontium, barium and mixtures of the same is reacted with a lower monohydric alcohol having 1 to 7 carbon atoms to form the alkaline earth metal alkoxide mixing a polyol or a monohydric alcohol having at least 4 carbon atoms with the lower alcohol alkaline earth metal alkoxide, and removing the lower monohydric alcohol from the reaction mixture. The calcium, strontium, and barium containing materials suitable for use in accordance with the process of the invention may be any metal containing material which will react with water to give the corresponding metal hydroxide and another reaction product. Exemplary of such suitable materials are calcium, strontium, and barium metals, calcium, strontium, and barium hydrides, and calcium, strontium, and barium acetylides. The lower monohydric alcohols which can be used are primary, secondary or tertiary aliphatic alcohols hav ing 1 to 7 carbon atoms and preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are branched or straight chain. Exemplary of pre ferred alcohols are methanol, ethanol, n propanol, iso propanol, n butanol, and iso butanol. Also suitable are n pentanol, 2 pentanol, 3 pentanol, n hexanol and the like. Suitable higher monohydric alcohols having at least 4 carbon atoms that may be used in accordance with the inven tion can be primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols which are straight or branched chain having at least 4 and preferably from 8 to about 30 or more carbon atoms. Exemplary of such primary straight chain alcohols are n octanol, nonanol, decano undecanol, dodecanol, tridecanol, tetradecanol, pentadecanol, hexadecanol, and octadecanol and of such branched chain or secondary alcohols are 2 ethylhexanol, isooctanol, secoctanol, and isodecanol. Particularly suitable are linear and branched primary alcohols and alcohol mixtures such as produced by the Oxo reaction of normal C3 C20 olefins. Aleo suitable are cycloaliphatic monohydric alcohols, including, for example, cycloheptanol and cyclooctanol, as well as phenyl substituted monohydric alcohols such as benzyl alcohol, phenylethyl alcohol, and phenpropyl alcohol. Polyols suitable for use in accordance with the present invention can have from two to thirty carbon atoms and from two to six hydroxyl groups including, for example, glycerine, glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, hexylctne glycol, heptylene glycol, neopentylene glycol, decylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, pentaerythritol, galactitol, sorbitol, mannitol, erythritol, trimethylolethane and trimethylolpropane. The process of the invention involves, in general, two steps. In the first step, calcium, strontium, or barium containing raw materials as hereinabove described are reacted with a lower aliphatic alcohol having 1 to about 7 and preferably to about 4 carbon atoms for the time necessary. to form the alkaline earth metal alkoxide. The temperature and pressure at which the reaction between the metal and the lower alcohol is conducted is not critical and can vary widely. In general, the higher the temperature the faster the rate of reaction. It is usually convenient and preferred to carry out the reaction in a temperature pressure region where the alcohol is a liquid. The amount of alkaline earth metal to be reacted with the lower alcohol is not narrowly critical but can vary widely. However, since the lower alcohol is to be removed during a further step of the catalyst preparation, it is preferred to use a larger amount of metal consistent with having a mixture with reasonable handling characteristics. In general, the concentration of metal in the lower alcohol may vary from about 0.01 to about 20 percent by weight, and preferably from about 0.1 to about 10 percent by weight of alcohol. In the next step of the process, the metal alkoxide in the lower alcohol is mixed with a polyol or a higher alcohol having at least 4 carbon atoms which is less volatile than the lower alcohol employed the first step of the process and the lower alcohol introduced with the lower alcohol metal alkoxide is removed from the mixture. Removal of the lower alcohol may be conducted by any separation means that retains the catalytic activity of the alkaline earth metal alkoxide. Preferably, distillation techniques are used, but other methods such as column chromatography, fractional freezing and the like may also be employed.The lower alcohol is removed from the mixture at a temperature and pressure whereby, for example, the lower alcohol is vaporized and the polyol or the higher alcoho is not, the temperature being dependent on the pressure and types of polyols or higher and lower alcohols that were used in the reactions. While a variety of higher alcohols or polyols as herein described may be employed in preparing the soluble meta alkoxide, it is usually preferred to employ the polyols, alcoh or mixtures thereof that is intended to be employed in the reaction with an epoxide to be catalyzed. The amount of higher alcohol or polyol mixed with the lower alcohol metal alkoxide reaction mixture should be sufficient to convert all of the lower alcohol metal alkoxide to the soluble basic salt thereof and preferably at least 10 percent greater than that stoichiometrically required. Alternatively, the higher alcohol or polyol mixed with the metal alkoxide in lower alcohol reaction product is the monohydric alcohol or polyol to be oxyalkylated which is added in the amount sufficient to give the desired level of catalyst in the monohydric alcohol or polyol, after removal of the lower alcohol, for the oxyalkylation reaction. The desired concentration of catalyst in the oxyalkylation reaction mixture is not critically narrow, and can, in general, vary from about 0.001 percent to about 10 percent by weight of calcium, strontium, or barium based on the reactive hydrogen compound. The solution of calcium, strontium, or barium alkoxide in higher alcohol or polyol so prepared is a basic alkaline salt of the alkaline earth metal which is soluble in the reactants employed during the reaction of an alkylene oxide and a reactive hydrogen compound such as monohydric alcohol and in the reaction products prepared thereby. The soluble basic salt of alkaline earth catalyst prepared in accordance with the practice of the invention catalyzes the reaction of an organic compound having an active compound selected from the group consisting of monohydric alcohols, polyols, and phenols with an epoxideThe reaction may be conducted in a conventional manner, that is, the active hydrogen compound and the catalyst are placed in a reactor, alkylene oxide is added at the reaction temperature until the desired number of moles have been added, and the product is removed from the reactor and neutralized. The reaction may be conducted in the presence of a solvent, but usually a solvent is not employed. The temperature at which the reaction proceeds is not narrowly critical and generally products can be made at a reasonable rate of reaction and without decomposition of the product at a temperature between about 50 C and 2700C with a temperature between about 100 C and 200 C being generally preferred. While the pressure of the reaction is not narrowly critical, when low boiling epoxides such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are employed,a pressurized reactor is preferably used. The product made may be neutralized with any acid that will convert the catalyst to a neutral salt, asfor example, acetic acid, carbon dioxide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and phenol. The novel catalysts of the invention are useful in effecting the oxyalkylation of primary and secondary monohydric aliphatic alcohols which are straight or branched chain and having from one to about thirty carbon atoms. Exemplary of such primary straight chain monohydric alcohols are methanol, ethanol, butanol,pentanol hexanol, heptanol, octanol, nonanol, decanol,ndecanol, dodecanol, tridecanol, tetradecanol, pentadecahal, hexadecanol, and octadecanol and of such branched chain or secondary alcohols are isopropyl alcohol, 2 ethylhexanol sec butanol, iso butanol, 2 pcntanol, 3 pentanol, iso octanol, sec octanol, and isodecanol.Particularly suitable are linear and branched primary alcohols and alcohol mixtures such as are produced by the Oxo reaction of normal C3 C20 olefins The process of the invention is also applicable to cycloaliphatic monohydric alcohols, including for example, cyclohexanol, cyclopentanol, cycloheptanol, cyclopropanol and cyclooctanol, as well as phenylsubstituted nonohydric alcohols such as benyzl alcohol, phenylethyl alcohol, and phenylpropyl alcohol. Applicable phenols include, for example phenol, alkyl phenols such as p methylphenol, p ethyl phenol, p butyl phenol, p heptyphenol, p nonyl phenol, dinonyl phenol, p decylphenol and the like. The aromatic radicals may contain other conventional substituents such as halide atoms The polyols to which the present invention is applicable can have from two to thirty carbon atoms and from two to six hydroxyl groups including, for example. glycerine, glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, hexylene glycol, heptylene glycol, neopentylene glycol, decylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, pentaerythritol, galactitol, sorbitol, mannitol, erythritol, trimedlylolethane and trimethyloSpropane. The epoxides which are applicable in accordance with the invention can be any epoxide having from two to about thirty carbon atoms. Exemplary epoxides include alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide propylene oxide1,2 butylene oxide 1,2 and 2,3 pentylene oxide,2 hexylene oxide 1,2 octylene oxide 1,2 and decylene oxide 1,2 and mixtures of the same epoxidized fatty alcohols derived from fatty oils such as epoxidized soybean fatty alcohols and epoxidized linseed oil fatty alcohols cycloalkylene epoxides including, for example, cyclohexane oxide, cyclopentene oxide, cycloheptene oxide aromatic epoxides such as styrene oxide and 2 methyl styrene oxide and hydroxy and halogen substituted epoxides such as glycidol, epichlorohydrin and epibromhydrin. The amount of catalyst used in accordance with the invention is not narrowly critical and a catalytic effect has been noted with only a small amount thereof being present. In general, the catalyst concentration cap vary from 0.001 percent to 10 percent by weight of calcium, strontium, and barium based on the wight of active hydrogen compound.Concentrations of alkaline earth metal within the range from about 0.05 percent to about 5.0 percent by weight of active hydrogen compound are usually preferred. The reaction rate, however, is dependent on both temperature and catalyst concentration and to achieve a given rate, more catalyst is required at a low temperature than at a high temperature. The invention will become more clear when considered together with the following examples which are set forth as being merely illustrative of the invention and which are not intended, in any manner, to be limitative thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight. EXAMPLE 1 To 500 cc of ethanol heated at 74 to 780C. in a l liter reaction flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, nitrogen inlet, and condenser was added 20 grams 0.5 moles of calcium metal over a 1.5 hour period. The calcium dissolved in the ethanol with evolution of hydrogen to give a cloudy solution of calcium ethoxide , which on cooling precipitated. The solid calcium ethoxide was collected by filtration and dried in a vacuum oven at 250C. To 1050 grams 4.95 moles of a mixture of C12 to C15 primary alcohols 605 branched, 40 normal isomers available under the tradename LIAL 125 fromLiquichemica Italia in a 2 liter, stirred, thermometer, nitrogen inlet and dry ice trap connected to a vacuum source, was added 25 grams 0.19 moles of the calcium ethoxide prepared above. The ethanol introduced with the calcium ethoxide was removed by heating the mixture at 90 C. and 3mm pressure for two thirds of an hour.The resulting sample was a substantially homogeneous solution although it contained some haze. The solution of clacium in alcohol prepared above was transferred to a steel, 2,5 gallon autoclave equipped with a stirrer, an automatic temperature controller, and an automatic feed controller. The autoclave was heated to 110 C., pressurized to 20 psig with nitrogen and then to 60 psig with ethylene oxide.By automatic control, 1685 grams 38.3 moles of ethylene oxide was fed to the autoclave at 1100C. over a period of 2.5 hours. After cookout to 33 psig, the product 2717 grams was cooled, drained from the reactor, and neutralized to a pH of 7 with acetic acid in a stirred flask. The calcium catalyst remained dissolved in the.reaction mixture until the neutralization step. In a second run, 8.2 grams 0.15 moles of potassium hydroxide in 1000 grams of the mixture ofC12 to C15 primary alcohols hereinabove described was charged into the 2.5 gallon autoclave and heated to llOtC under 60 psig pressure as above. 1685 grams 38.3 moles of ethylene oxide was then fed to the autoclave and reacted with the alcohol at 110 C over a period of 0.65 hours. After cookout, the product 2707 grams was cooled, drained from the reactor and neutralized to a pH of 7 with acetic acid. Gel permeation chromatography, a standard technique for determining the molecular weight distribution of polymers and surfactants was used to evaluate the reaction products. A comparison of the widths of gel permeation peaks at their half heights, all ru n at constant conditions, is a measure of the relative broadness of the molecular weight distribution oç the polymers or surfactants. Wrnen the performance of the instrument is calibrated with standards of known molecular weights, it is possible to define the molecular weight range represented by the peak width at half height. Gel permeation chromatography results on the products of run num 1 and 2 hereof are reported in Table I, below.

EXAMPLE 2 To a 2 liter glass reaction flask equipped with a condenser, drying tube and nitrogen inlet was added 1000 ml of ethanol and 11 grams 0.08 moles of barium metal granules. The barium and ethanol started reacting immwdiately at ambient temperature and were allowed to continue until all the metal was reacted. A clear solution was formed to which was added 550 grams 2.96 moles of l decanol. The condenser was replaced on the reactor flask with a distillation head, and ethanol was distilled from the flask. To completely remove the ethanol, the flask contents were held at 1100C. at 2 m3 vacuum for 0.25 hours. A clear solution of barium alkoxide in dodecanol was thus formed. The solution of barium alkoxide contained 0.138 moles of barium per 1000 grams of l dodecanol as determined by titration with 0.10N aqueous hydrochloric acid and a phenophthadine indicator. A 500 gram 2.69 moles of dod cnol portion of the solution was placed in the 2.5 gallon autoclave of Example 1 and pressurized as described in Example 1. A total of 770 grams 17.5 moles of ethylene oxide was added over a period of 0.72 hours while heating the autoclave at 1400C. After a period of heating at 140 C. to completely react the ethylene oxide, the reactor was cooled and a 506 gram sample of reaction product was removed, neutralized to a pH of 77 with phosphoric acid and filtered. Results of an analysis of the product are reported in Table II, below. To the product remaining in the autoclave 764 grams was added 767 grams 13.2 moles of propylene oxide at 1400C. and 60 psig pressure over a period of 1.4 hours. After cookout, the product was removed from the autoclave, neutralized to a pH of 7 with phosphoric acid and filtered. Results of an analysis o the product are reported in Tables II and III. In a second test run, the procedure of test run num 1 above was followed using 7.0 grams 0.08 moles of strontium metal granules instead of barium metal.The clear dodecanol solution of strontium alkoxide formed thereby,which contained 0.135 moles of strontium per 1000 grams of dodecanol,was reacted with 762 grams 17.3 moles of ethylene oxide and then with 784 grams 13.5 moles of propylene oxide using the procedure described in test run num 1 hereinabove. Results of the analysis of the products produced thereby are reported in Tables II and III. In a third tr run, 15 grams of barium hydroxide were mixed with 550 grams of l dodecanol in the 2 liter reaction flask described above. After heating at 1100C. for 2 hours.the barium hydroxide did not substantially dissolve in the dodecanol. A portion of the mixture of dodecanol and barium hydroxide which contained 2.2 weight percent of barium was reacted with ethylene oxide using the procedure described in test run 1 above and results of an analysis of the products formed are reported in Tables II and III, below. In a fourth test run, 3.2 grams of calcium metal was reacted with 1000 ml. of methanol at reflux to prepare calcium methoxide and then 550 grams of l dodecanol were added thereto and the methanol was removed by distillation to a final temperature of ll00C. at 2mm vacuum. A dispersion in dodecanol was prepared which was then reacted with ethylene oxide using the procedure of test run 01 hereof. The further redaction with propylene oxide was not performed. It was found that the dodecanol dispersion with calcium prepared as described above in this test run did not react with ethylene oxide at l4OCC. but that at 170 C., reaction with ethylene oxide did take place.Results of an analysis of the products produced in this test run are reported inTables II and III. In a fifth test run, generally using the procedure of test run 1, hereof 0.072 moles of calcium metal granules were reacted with 140 ml of ethanol at reflux to form a clear solution. 500 Grams of l dodecanol were then added to the calcium ethoxide solution and the ethanol was removed by distillation. The resulting solution of calcium alkoxide in dodecanol was charged to the 2.5 gal. autoclave of this example and 770 grams of ethylene oxide were added at 1400C. and 60 psig. After completion of the reaction of the ethylene oxide the reaction mixture was cooled, discharged from the autoclave and neutralized with acetic acid. Results of an analysis of the product are re ported in Tables II and III. In a sixth test run, 0.072 moles of potassium hydroxide were added to 500 grams of l dodecanol and the mixture was stripped in a stirred flask at 1100C.and high vacuum. The mixture was charged to the autoclave of this Example and 757 grams of ethylene oxide were added at 1400C. and 60 psig. An analysis of products produced thereby are reported in Tables II and III.

It is also shown, however, that barium hydroxide and calcium methoxide, which do not form a soluble salt with dodecanol, are not as active catalysts as the soluble salts of barium and calcium. EXAMpLE 3 A fixture of 1.5 liters of calcium ethozida in ethanol prepared by reacting 28 grams 0.70 moles of calcium metal with 1.5 liters of ethanol at reflux and 600 grams 6.5 moles of glycerine is heated under vacuu to remove the ethanol. Five hundred and sixty five grams 6.14 moles of glycerine of the solution containing glycerine and basic salt of calcium is charged into a 2 gallon steel autoclave reactor equipped with an automatic temperature controller, an automatic pressure and reactant feed controller, and circulating means for the reactants. The autoclave is heated to 1170C, pressurized to 12 psig with nitrogen and then to 70 psig with propylene oxide.Over a 2 hour period, 365 grams 6.3 moles of propylene oxide is fed to the autoclave while maintaining the temperature at 117 C. The temperature of the autoclave is then raised to 135µC and an additional 3390 grams 58.4 moles of propylene oxide is added over a period of 5 hours while maintaining the temperature at 135tC and a constant pressure.After all the propylene oxide is added, the autoclave is held at 135 C for one additional hour to achieve cazelete reaction after which the reactor is cooled and the reaction mixture is discharged and analyzed. The reaction product is a clear solution which is determined to have a hydroxyl number of 238 from which a molecular weight of 707 is calculated assuming a functionality of 3. EXAMPLE 4 To a 2 liter glass flask equipped with a distillation head was charged 1100 grams 5.2 moles of the mixture of C12 to C15, primary alcohol of Example 1 and 20.8 grams 0.52 moles of calcium metal granules. The contents of the flask were heated to 1200C. and no reaction occurred as evidenced by zero gas flaw at constant temperature. Over a period of 0.5 hours, the temperature was raised to 190 C. but there was still no evidence of a reaction.
