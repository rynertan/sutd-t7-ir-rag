# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO CUTTERS

## Abstract
The invention describes a cutter which is for positioning in an underground pipe which is too small for man entry. The cutter is for cutting holes in previously applied pipe lining which cover lateral connections. The cutting must be control led from above ground. Flexibility and positionability is achieved by mounting the cutter head at the free end of a boom body, the other end of which is mounted through a universal joint to a mounting so that the boom can swing in any direction. The cutter is controlled in its movement by coupling it to a master unit located and controlled above ground.
