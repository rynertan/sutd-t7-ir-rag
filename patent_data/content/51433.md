# One pass process for forming electrode backing sheet.

## Abstract
A one pass process for forming a porous uniaxially oriented polytetrafluoroethylene sheet which is coherent and suitable for utilization as an electrode backing wetproofing sheet or layer uses particulate PTFE blended in an organic liquid medium to form a dispersion, to which a pore forming agent is then added. After mixing, the organic liquid is removed and the dry mixture is fibrillated, chopped and formed into a sheet by passing it once through heated rollers.
