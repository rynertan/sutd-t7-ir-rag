## Description
Disclosure The present invention relates to E process for the production of polynhnnylene oxide, by continuously oper ating and with the precipitation of the polymer in the liquid medium of the reaction. Polyphenylene oxide is a thermonlastic valuable polymer, which is obtained in the art by means of the oxide tive polymerisation of 2,6 xylenol. Said polyphenylene oxide is used among others, blended with polymers and cc polymers of styrene. According to the technique know, 2,6 xylenol can be polymerized by means bf the contact with oxygen, or with a gas containing molecular oxygen, operating in a liquid reaction medium, in which the catalyst, the monomer and the related polymer are soluble. Such a process in the homogeneous liquid phase may also be carried out in a continuous mode, e.g., as disclosed by the U.K. Pat.NO 9301933, and by the U.S. Pat. N 3,405,092. The processes carried out in the liquid homogeneous phase suffer from the drawbacks deriving fro the visco sity of polymer solutions, from the difficulty of deac tivating the catalyst and of withdrawing. the deactivat ed catalyst from such viscous solution at the end of the polymerization and of the costs and complexity of the operations required to the purpose of separating the polymer and recovering the liquid medium of the reaction. It is also known to prepare the polyphenylene oxide by polymerizing 2,6 xylenol in a liquid reaction medium in which the monomer and the catalyst are soluble, whilst the polymer is insoluble or substantially insoluble. Such a process is described e.g. in the polish Pat. N 57,910, in which the polymerization of 2,6 xylenol is carried out batchv ise. A process in the heterogeneous phase, such as that disclosed by the Polish Patent mentioned, allows many of the disadvantages to be overcome, which are typical of the operation i homogeneous phase. However, the fact of operating batchwise makes it difficult to obtain 2 polyphenylene oxide with constant character istics from batch to batch.On the other side, the difficulties due to the practical application of a continuous process for the tolymerization of 2,6 xylenol in a reaction medium, from which the polyphenylene oxide precipitates, have not allowed up to date such a process to be successfully used on comercial scale. The purpose of the present invention is therefore a continuous process which, overcoming the diffculties said, allows 2,6 xylenol to be Polymerized in 2 simple and convenient way, by operating in a liquid reaction medium, in which the polyphenylene oxide precipitates during the polymerizing course. In particular, according to the present invention polyphenylene oxide is prepared by oxidative polyrleriza tion of 2,6 xylenol, with oxygen or a gas containing mo lecular oxygen, in the presence of 2 catalyst, in a liq uid reaction medium, in which the catalyst and he monomer are soluble, and the polyphenylene oxide is insoluble or substantially insoluble, by means of a process, in which the catalyst and the monomer are continuously fed in to the bottom of a vertical and elongated reaction vessel, dissolved in a liquid solvent, or in a mixture of liq uid solvents, incapable of dissolving the polyphenylene oxide a gaseous stream of oxygen, or of z gas containing mo lecular oxygen is continuosly fed in to the bottom of said reaction vessel at the top of said reaction vessel a dispersion is con tinuously recovered of solid polyphenylene oxide in the relevant liquid reaction mixture a portion of said dispersion is continuously recycled and is fed in, together with the catalyst and 2,5 xylen ol, into the relevant solution, at the bottom of said reaction vessel, maintaining a weight ratio between the recycled portion and the fresh feed of at least 100 1 the polyhenylene oxide is recovered from the residual portion of the dispersion recovered at the top of the reactor the thermal effect of the polymerization is controlled by means of heat exchange inside and or outside the polymerization reactor. The catalyst usually employed for the polymerization of 2,6 xylenol is cupric chloride, conveniently as a com plex with an organic base, such as morpholine. The liquid medium used for the polymerization is ca pable of dissolving 2,6 xylenol, as ell as the complex catalyst, but is incapable, or substantially incapable, of dissolving polyphenylene oxide. Liquid reaction media suitable to the purpose are mixtures of aromatic hydro carbons and aliphatic alcohols, and preferably a blend of toluene and ethanol. The cupric chloride complexed with the organic base and the 2,6 xylenol are fed to the polymerization reactor as solutions, preferably separated solutions, in a liquid solvent, which is preferably the same solvent used as the liquid reaction medium. To the reactor also 2 gaseous stream is fed in, of oxygen, or of a gas containing molecular oxygen, e.g., air, in a quantity equivalent to, or slightly in excess of the stoichiometric quantity required for the oxidative polycondensation reaction of 2,6 xylenol. The hexothermic character of the reaction is control led by means of heat exchangers, so as to keep the temperature of the reaction mixture at values constantly low er than about 35 C. According to the present invention, the process is carried out by means of a cyclic reaction system, in which the reaction products, drawn from the top of the reactor, are partly recycled to the bottom. o the reactor, where they are fed in together with the solution containing the catalyst and the 2,6 xylenol. In particular, weight ratios are maintained of the recycled fraction and the fresh feed, of at least 10 1. Moreover, the feeding rate of the mixture into the reactor, measured as linear steed of the same mixture at the inlet of the reaction vessel, is held at a value of at least 1 metre second. To this purpose, an ejector may be used, provided with a nozzle. Finally, the gaseous stream of the oxygen, or of the gas containing olecular oxygen, is fed in, in correspondance of said ejector.By operating under thee conditions, turbulent conditions are maintained inside the reactor of the reactant mass, a good control is guaranteed of the temperature of the same mass, and the problems are solved relative to the distribution of gaseous oxen inside said mass, thus guaranteeing the homogeneity of the polymerization reac tion, and the safety conditions, in that, as t is well known, large bubbles of oxygen may cause explosion ph nomena. For a better understanding of the process of this invention, reference is made to Fig. of enclosed drawing. In this Figure, by 24 the feeding line is sho wn of 2,6 xylenol solution, and by 22 the feeding line is shown cf the solution of the catalyst complexes with the organic base. These two srllltions, mixed with the reac tion mixture outcoming from line 40 , are fec through the circulation pump 26 to the nozzle 28 at the bot tom of the polymerization reactor 10 . To the nozzle 28 also 2 stream of oxygen, or of gas containing molecular oxygen, is fed, by the line 30 . The mixture escaping from nozzle 26 enters the reactor of elongated shape 10 , of tapered shape in its lower portion, where the polymerization takes place of ,6 xylenol within the mass kept under turbulent conditions. In the heat exchanger 12 at least 2 part of the heat is released, which is developed during the polymer ization. The possibly in excess gas is purged from the reactor 10 through the line 22 , atop of the same reactor, and is discharged by the line 34 , or recycled, partly or totally, by the line 36 . The reaction mix ture is drawn laterally, in the nearby of the top of the reactor 10 , by the line 38 , and sent to the tank 14 .A portion of such mixture is recycled to the bottom of reactor 10 , through the line 4 0 , after a preliminary possible heat exchange in heat exchanger 16 . The residual portion of the reaction mixture is drawn by the line 42 and sent to the tank 18 , where the catalyst is increaesed, e.g., by nears of an acid, fed in by the line 44 . After this treatment, the reaction mixture is sent by the line 46 to the centrifuge 20 , to which also alcohol is fed by the line 48 . Fror the centrifuge 20 the solid polyphenylene oxide is separat ed by the line 50 from the liquid reaction and washing medium which is is discharged by the line 52 . By operating according to the process of this inven tion, the obtainment is possible of a polyphenylene oxide with constant molecular weight, as an easily separable solid. The concentration of the polymer in the reaction medium, moreover, results to be at least twice as large as that technically useable in the processes in homogeneous phase. Moreover, by operating according to the process of this invention, high polymerizing rates are obtained, with a practically complete consumption cf the oxygen fed in. folloing experimental Examples are illustrative and not limitative of the invention.

The linear speed of the mixture at the inlet of the reactor 10 is of about 1,5 m sec. The reac tion temperature is maintained at 23 320C by means of the heat exchangers 12, 16 , having an exchange surface of 1 m2. .The recovered portion of reaction mixture line 42 is treated with acetic acid to pH 7 vessel 18 . The polyphenylene oxide is washed with ethanol and centrifuged centrifuge 20 . A quantity of 2,77 kg hour is obtained on the aver age of polyphenylene oxide it an intrinsic viscosity of 0,5 dl g, measured at 25 C in chloroform.
