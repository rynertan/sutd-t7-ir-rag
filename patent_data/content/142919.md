# Energy recycling scissors lift.

## Abstract
A scissors mechanism supports a platform 62 and is coupled to a sealed gas cylinder 71 or other energy storage device in such a way that the cylinder tends to lift the platform, and an article on the platform such as a television set, a bar, office equipment, a tabletop, etc. The lift may be enclosed in a compact cabinet so that the article on the platform is concealed when down, and accessible when up. Energy released in lowering the article is stored in compression of gas within the storage device 71 and subsequently reused in raising the article. Compensation is provided for the strongly varying mechanical advantage provided by the scissors mechanism, so that the stored energy can operate smoothly on the article throughout the entire operating range of the scissors, making possible the use of the energy recycling system. In one embodiment the stored energy alone is made capable of raising the article through the entire range of the mechanism, but the article can be easily lowered by manual application of light downward force even though, for mechanical simplicity, the energy storage device remains connected to raise the article. In another embodiment this manual application of controlling force is replaced by a remote control actuator, such as a small motor or a small hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder. Such a remote control actuator applies pilot forces upward or downward to control the direction of operation, while the sealed gas cylinder 71 generally bears the weight of the platform and the article on it.
