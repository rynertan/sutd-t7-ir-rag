## Description
Single incubation immunochemical assayBackground of the InventionSolid phase Sandwich immunoassay is a technique utilized to assay a ligand having at least two antibody combining sites or epitopes. This type of assay is currently one of the most sensitive methods used to determine biologically active components in plasma and other body fluids. The assay requires the interaction of three components 1 the ligand to be assayed 2 specific antibody directed against the ligand attached to an insoluble support material and 3 enzyme labeled antibody that is specific for the ligand.The methodology of the Sandwich assay involves 1 incubating the ligand with insolubilized specific antibody to produce an initial insolubilized antibody ligand conjugate 2 separating the initial conjugate and unreacted ligand 3 incubating the initial conjugate with enzyme labeled antibody to produce a final insolubilized antibody ligand enzyme labeled antibody conjugate 4 separating the final conjugate and unreacted enzyme labeled antibody and 5 determining the enzyme activity of either the final conjugate solid phase or the separated unreacted enzyme labeled conjugate liquid phase . The enzyme activity determined is related to the amount of ligand in the test fluid.While the conventional Sandwich assay excels in sensitivity, it is time consuming and laborious to run due to the number of steps involved. When one attempts to reduce the number of steps in a conventional assay by incubating insolubilized antibody, ligand and enzyme labeled antibody in the presence of one another, enzyme labeled antibody tends to bind most of the available epitopes on the ligand and Sandwich formation is im paired. The tendency of the labeled antibody to monopolize or saturate the ligand occurs because the labeled antibody i.e. solution antibody has greater motility than the insolubilized antibody.The present invention circumvents the problems inherent in the prior art by providing a method of determining a ligand in a Sandwich assay which utilizes a single incubation.Summary of the InventionThe present invention relates to a diagnostic method for determining a ligand in a liquid medium. More particularly, the invention relates to diagnostic methods for the determination of ligands associated with pathogenic disease states.In the invention, the determination of ligands is accomplished utilizing a modified solid phase Sandwich assay. The two antibody reagents employed in the assay method contain antibodies directed against different epitopes on the ligand. The use of two antibodies having different binding specificities permits simultaneous incubation of insolubilized antibody, ligand, and enzyme labeled antibody with resulting optimum sandwich geometry. Alignment of the ligand in the sandwich matrix is achieved in the present invention by employing polyclonal and or monoclonal antibodies.Accordingly, a first aspect of the invention relates to a method for determining a ligand in a liquid medium suspected of containing same, which comprises providing a reaction mixture comprising i liquid medium suspected of containing said ligand ii insolubilized first antibody reagent containing antibody having specificity for at least one epi tope on said ligand and iii enzyme labeled second antibody reagent containing antibody having specificity for at least one dif ferent epitope on said ligand, said second anti body reagent being non reactive with at least one epitope bindable by said first antibody reagent incubating said reaction mixture to form an insolubilized antibody ligand labeled antibody conjugate when said ligand is present in the liquid medium separating the reaction mixture into a solid phase and a liquid phase and determining the enzyme activity of either the solid phase or the liquid phase whereby said activity is related to the amount of ligand in said liquid medium.A second aspect of the invention relates to the use of monoclonal specific antibodies in the first and second antibody reagents employed in the method taught herein.Still another aspect of the invention relates to the use of polyclonal specific antibodies in the first and second antibody reagents employed in the method taught herein.A futher aspect of the present invention relates to the method taught herein wherein one of the first and second antibody reagents contains polyclonal specific antibody and the other reagent contains monoclonal specific antibody.A still further aspect of the present invention relates to the determination of specific ligands, namely CPK MB or human chorionic gonadotropin, by the method of the present invention. Detailed DescriptionBoth polyclonal and monoclonal specific antibodies may be employed in the process of the present invention.Polyclonal specific antibodies are produced in an animal in response to immunization with a specific immunizing molecule immunogen . Antibodies produced in this manner do not cross react with other immunogens. A polyclonal antiserum contains a population of antibodies which is directed against a number of antigenic determinants epitopes on the immunogen.Monoclonal specific antibodies are derived by fusing splenic lymphocytes obtained from an immunized host with malignant myeloma cells. Such fusion results in hybrid cells which express both the lymphocyte s property of specific antibody production and the immortal character of the myeloma cells. The progeny, or clone of a single hybrid cell secretes monoclonal antibody which is specifically directed against a single epitope on the immunogen.Both of the above described antibody types may be employed in the antibody reagents utilized in the present invention, i.e. polyclonal or monoclonal specific antibody may be independently employed in the first and second antibody reagents used herein provided that antibody in the first reagent and antibody in the second reagent recognize and bind different epitopes on the ligand being determined.When a ligand contains two different, isolatable, antibody generating subunits having non shared epitopes, the ligand can be determined by reaction with a first antibody reagent containing antibody directed against epitopes on one subunit and a second antibody reagent con taining antibody directed against epitopes on the other subunit. Illustrative examples of ligand containing isolatable, antibody generating a and B subunits having non shared epitopes include thyroid stimulating hormone TSH , follicle stimulating hormone FSH , luteinizing hormone LH , human chorionic gonadotropin HCG and melanocyte stimulating hormone MSH . The a subunits in all of the aforementioned hormones are identical.Accordingly, antibody directed against the a subunit may be employed in the determination of any of the above recited hormones when used in conjunction with antibody generated against the specific B subunit of the hormone being determined.In the case of an enzyme existing in the form of multiple isoenzymes composed of combinations of two subunits, the heterodimeric isoenzyme may be determined according to the present invention by employing a first antibody reagent containing antibody directed against one of the homodimeric isoenzymes and a second antibody reagent containing antibody directed against the other homodimeric isoenzyme. The enzyme creatine phosphokinase exists in the form of at least three isoenzymes designated CPK MM, CPK MB and CPK BB. In the present invention, the heterodimeric isoenzyme CPK MB is determined by employing antibody to one of the homodimeric isoenzymes i.e. CPK MM or CPK BB in the first antibody reagent and antibody to the other homodimeric isoenzyme in a second antibody reagent. If a ligand contains subunits which cannot be isolated for the generation of specific antibody or if the ligand exists in the form of non dissociable molecules, the ligand may be determined according to the present invention by employing monoclonal specific antibody in the first and second antibody reagents provided antibody contained in the first reagent and antibody contained in the second reagent bind different epitopes on the ligand being determined. a Fetoprotein AFP and carcinoembryonic antigen CEA are examples of ligands that can be determined by employing monoclonal specific antibody in the first and second antibody reagents.When a ligand contains two different, isolatable subunits having non shared epitopes and only one of the isolated subunits is capable of generating specific antibody, the non dissociated ligand may be used to generate monoclonal antibody directed against the other subunit. Under the foregoing circumstances, the ligand may be determined according to the present invention by employing polyclonal specific antibody in one of the antibody reagents and monoclonal specific antibody in the other antibody reagent.Both polyclonal and monoclonal specific antibodies against ligands measurable by the present invention are available commercially or can be prepared by known procedures. See for example Hurn et al, Production ofReagent Antibodies in Method in Enzymology, 70, 104 142 1980 .The first antibody reagent employed herein comprises appropriate antibody attached to an insoluble support.Suitable support materials that may be utilized include, for example, polypropylene, polystyrene, nylon, cellulose and the like. Polystyrene microtiter plates, nylon beads and nylon and cellulose fibers afford suitable support means for the attachment of antibody. The attachment of antibody to the support is not critical and may be accomplished by 1 covalent coupling of the antibody to the support material 2 physical entrapment of the antibody in the support material and 3 physical adsorption of the antibody on the support material.The second antibody reagent employed herein comprises appropriate antibody labeled with a suitable enzyme. Enzymes suitable for use in the present invention include horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, ss galactosidase, glucoamylase and the like. The enzyme labeled second antibody reagent of the present invention is prepared by covalent coupling of the selected enzyme to the antibody. Methods employed for coupling enzymes to antibodies include condensation of existing functional groups in the presence or absence of a coupling reagent. A useful method for coupling horseradish peroxidase HRP to proteins involves oxidizing the carbohydrate moiety of the enzyme with sodium periodate and thereafter allowing the resulting aldehyde groups to react with amino groups of the antibody. Nakane et al, J. Histochim. Cytochem., 22, 1084 1974 .Alkaline phosphatase can be coupled to proteins by the condensation of free amino groups in the foregoing entities with aldehyde groups provided by a coupling reagent such as glutaraldehyde. Additional details on coupling methods are described in the art. See for example Kennedy et al, Clin.Chim. Acta, 70, 1 1976 .The process of the present invention is carried out by simultaneously combining liquid medium suspected of containing the ligand, insolubilized first antibody reagent and enzyme labeled second antibody reagent. The resulting reaction mixture is incubated for approximately 1 to 4 hours at room temperature. After incubation, the liquid phase of the reaction mixture is separated from the insoluble phase and the enzyme activity of either phase is determined by a suitable detection reaction.The enzymatic activity of the insoluble phase will be directly related to the amount of ligand in the liquid test Example whereas the enzymatic activity of the liquid phase will be inversely related to the amount of ligand in the test sample.The determination of enzymatic activity in the present invention is accomplished with a detection reaction system suitable for the particular enzyme employed. Since there are differences, not only between assays for different enzymes, but even in the variety of assays for a particular enzyme, no general description of the assay techniques can be given however, a wide diversity of media, conditions and substrates suitable for enzymes employed herein can be found in Bergmeyer, Methods ofEnzymatic Analysis, Academic Press, New York, 1965.In order to obtain quantitative results using the process of the present invention, the quantity of the insolubilized first antibody reagent mixed with test liquid and enzyme labeled second antibody reagent should generally be larger than the quantity which is capable of forming bonds with the total amount of ligand assumed to be in the test liquid. The quantity, in practice, is chosen in conformity with the aforementioned criteria based on the assumption that the ligand is present in the liquid medium at the highest concentration possible.The liquid medium suspected of containing the ligand may be a natural or synthetic liquid. In many instances, the liquid will be a biological fluid. Biological fluids which may be examined for ligands according to the process of the present invention include, for example, serum, plasma, urine, amniotic fluid and cerebrospinal fluid.The term ligand as used herein refers to a molecule having a least two different epitopes capable of being bound simultaneously by antibody reagents specific for each epitope.Description of specific embodimentsThe following specific description is given to enable those skilled in the art to more clearly understand and practice the present invention. It should not be considered as a limitation upon the scope of the invention but merely as being illustrative and representative thereof.Example IThe following example illustrates the determination of creatine phosphokinase MB using the process of the present invention.1.
