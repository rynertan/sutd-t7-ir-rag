# Method for producing a single crystal.

## Abstract
A single crystal is produced by previously forming macro crystal grains having substantially the same crystal structure as crystal grains comprising a polycrystal exhibiting disconti nuous crystal grain growth or forming the macrocrystal grains after preparing a polycrystal in contact with the crystal grains comprising the polycrystal and heating such a contacted body at a temperature lower than the temperature causing the dis continuous crystal grain growth of the polycrystal to grow a crystal while integrating the macrocrystal grains with the cry stal grains comprising the polycrystal, whereby a single crystal is grown.
