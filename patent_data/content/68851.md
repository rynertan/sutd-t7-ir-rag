## Description
t METALLIC SALTS OF HINDERED PHENOLIC ANTI OXIDANT AS ANTI GEL COMPONENT IN TRANSITION METAL CATALYZED OLEFIN POLYMERS CONTAININGHALIDE RESIDUEThis invention relates to anti gel compounds useful for reducing optical degradation phenomene in extruded olefin polymer film. The compounds also are useful for preventing corro sion during processing of olefin polymer film or on molded articles. Olefin polymers such polyethylene have been used for a number of years for the preparation of films by extrusion processes. Unlike high pressure, free radical polymerized polyethylenes, low pressure, low density polyethylenes prepared in the presence of transition metal catalysts e.g. the well known catalysts develop gel like defects when extruded, for example as blown films. In a blown film process, polyethylene pellets or granules are melted and extruded from an annular die to form a film envelope. In the extruder and die system, there are typically dead spots or hangup areas where molten polyethylene does not move rapidly, resulting in long heat histories for portions of the melt. As portions of the polymer are flushed from these hangup areas, they cause optical degradation phenomena in the film, known as pinstriping and gel streaking . fly pinstriping is Leant here bends resulting fro accumulation of nitro gels which are aligned in the nathine direction during the film forming process. By gel streaking is meant surface roughness in the form of the inclusion, either singularly or in rovs, of v shaped gels arrowheads or chevrone , streas of soft gels, or, in extreme caaes,a film texture completely permeated by aloft gels.Such optical degradation phenonena not only detract from flin optical and mechanical strength properties, but also can cause severe problems with respect to maintaining bubble geometry during the film forming process. Because of the fact that the extrusion processes usually involve the use of relatively high extrusion temperatures and prolonged extrusion times, in commercial practice, various antioxidants, such as hindered phenolics, are admixed with the transition metal catalyzed olefin polymer, containing halide residue to prevent undesirable degradation of the polymer during the preparation of the film. When such anti oxidants are used, however, with the film forming grades of olefin polymers in certain types of extrusion equipment, the anti oxidants appear to enhance, if not create, gel streaking and pinstriping in the products thus formed, as well as corrosion of the extrusion equipment. Many solutions have been proposed to eliminate problems caused by transition metal catalyst halide, for example the Ziegler Natta catalyst chloride residue, such as discoloration, lack of stability, equipment corrosion, gelstreaking and pinstriping. For example, it is known to remove physically the halide catalyst residue, prior to extrusion, by leaching the reaction product of polymer and catalyst with alcohols, aqueous acid, water, or treating the polymer and catalyst with propylene oxide followed by an alcohol or water wash. Such treatments usually produce white polymers initially, but a yellow or tan color returns when the polymers are subjected to molding and or heating operations. In order to avoid this undesirable color formation, it is usually necessary to use a second or even a third clean up procedure requiring the use of large quantities of deactivating materials.Another practice in the art involves drying the after treated polymer prior to fabrication.Because they usually must be repeated several times in order to obtain a polymer having acceptable color upon exposure to heat. such clean up procedures are both expensive and time consuzing. Illustrative of such prior art treatments are those disclosed in U.S. A 3,925,341 3,962,199 3,247,351 4,029,877 4,117,219 3,299,027 3,923,760 3,308,105 and 4,098,990. Other treatments disclosed in the prior art involve the addition of compounds to the polymer prior to fabrication in order to complex with the harmful components in the catalyst residue and deactivate them Illustrative of these prior art treatments are those disclosed in Canadian A 961,998, U.S. A 4,013,622 and in U.S. A 3,773,743. Tor example, U.S. A 3,773,743 discloses 4 method for improving the stability and color of olefin polymers by deactivating their Ziegler Natta catalyst residues. This method involves high temperature 190 C 250 C processing with hydroxyl compounds H2O and primary alcohols and vith an organic base such as an alkyl amine aryl gamine Li. Ca and Zn salts of carboxylic acids trialkyl phosphltes and metal alkoxides.The concentration disclosed for the hydroxy source is the range of 0.5 to 1.5 weight percent and a concentration of 5D to 2500 parts per million ppm is disclosed for the organic base. At the processing temperatures disclosed, some of the organic bases and the hydroxy surces would be volatile and cause foaming of the product if the processing were not done in a way to remove volatiles. e.g.1 as in devolatilizing extruder fn high temperature processing of Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer resins such as in slot cast or blown fils extrusion or in molding processes, it has been observed that the chloride catalyst residue present Jn the resins zay cause corrosion of the processing equipment. For example, corrosion pitting has been observed on both the chill roll and internal adaptor as well as on die surfaces during slot cast film extrusion. internal adaptor and die surfaces of blown film extrusion equipment also are subject to corrosion. Surfaces of molds are also subject to mold staining and pitting.Deactivation of the chloride catalyst residue is required in a costly separate step prior to processing of the rcsin. An object of the present invention is to seek to provide a filmforming extrudable composition comprising a transition metal catalyzed olefin polymer and a metallic salt derived from a hindered phenolic anti oxidant, and an extruded film ade from ruth extrudable composition, which film is free from gel streaking A further object of the present invention is to seek to provide a process wherein transition metal catalyzed olefin polymer film forming compositions containing halide residue and containing a metallic salt derived from a hindered phenolic anti oxidant may be extruded without optical degradation phenomenon appearing within the extruded film. Another object of the present invention is to seek to provide a metallic phenolate salt anti gel compound, which when added to transition metal catalyzed olefin polymer containing halide residue is useful in removing or reacting with the halide residue in said olefin polymers under extrusion conditions to prevent gelstreaking or pinstriping from occurring in subsequent extrusion process. 11 An additional object of the present invention is to seek to provide a masterbatch concentrate which can be admixed with a transition metalcatalyzed olefin polymer containing halide residue to provide the extrudable film forming composition of this invention. Another object of the present invention is to seek to provide an improved method of deactivating a halide catalyst residue in a process for producing an extruded film, sheet or molded article from a transition metal catalyzed olefin polymer composition which method comprises adding to said olefin polymer composition a metallic salt derived from a hindered phenolic anti oxidant, which process is substantially free from corrosion. This invention is based on the discovery that optical degradation phenomena, known as gel streaking and pinstriping, present in extruded transition metal catalyzed olefin pqlymer, containing halide residue can be substantially prevented through the addition of small amounts of a metallic phenolate salt derived from a hindered phenolic anti oxidant of relatively low volatility.The presence of such metallic phenolate salt also is believed to prevent or reduce corrosion of extrusion processing equipment. The metallic phenolate salt comprises an alkali metal phenolate salt, an alkaline earth metal phenolate salt, a zinc phenolate salt or mixtures thereof. According to the present invention the incidence of gel streaking or pinstriping in the film during the extrusion of an olefin polymer and corrosion of processing equipment is minimized through the use of a composition comprising a majority of a transition metal catalyzed olefin polymer containing halide residue and a minor amount of at least one metallic phenolate salt derived from hindered phenolic anti oxidant as defined herein. This invention also relates to an improved method of extruding a transition metal catalyzed olefin polymer containing catalyst residue which comprises extruding a film forming composition containing a transition metal catalyzed olefin polymer containing halide residues and minor amounts of at least one metallic salt derived from a hindered phenolic anti oxidant. Moreover, this invention relates to a mas terbatch concentrate which may be admixed with a transition metal catalyzed olefin polymer containing halide residues to yield the film forming composition of this invention. In one aspect, the present invention relates to an extrudable film forming composition which1 when extruded1 forms a film essentially devoid of gel streaking and pinstriping, the filmforming extrudable composition comprising a transition metalcatalyzed olefin polymer containing halide residue and a metallic phenolate salt derived from hindered phenolic anti oxidant.Preferably, the olefin polymer is prepared using a Ziegler Katta catalyst. The olefin polymer contains chloride catalyst residue fro the Ziegler Natta catalyst. The metallic phenolate salt is present in an amount sufficient to neutralize the Ziegler Natta chloride residue and serve as an anti gel compound The hindered phenolic anti oxidant is partly reformed to prevent oxidation of the film during extrusion processing and subsequent storage thereof. The amount of metallic phenolate salt necessary to neutralize the chloride catalyst residue should be greater than about 5 times, preferably greater than about 10 times1 and most preferably greater than about 20 times the amount of chloride catalyst residue present. When the ratio becomes too high, particularly at the higher chloride catalyst levels, e.g., at 200 ppm chloride catalyst residue, the metallic phenolate salt can exude to the polymer air interface and adversely affect oleftn polymer surface properties such as sealing, treatability and coefficient of frlctlon. Below a 5 to 1 ratio, the amount of metallic phenolate salt tay not be sufficient to neutralize the chloride catalyst residue to retard gel streaking, etc. The residues of Ziegler Natta catalysts include trace amounts of magnesium titanium, aluminum and chlorine. By chloride catalyst residues, as used herein, is meant the chlorides of magnesium, titanium and aluminum present in a Ziegler Natta catalyst residue. Chloride catalyst residue from a Ziegler Natta catalyst is typically present in a concentration between 5 and 500 ppm based upon the olefin polymer. Chloride catalyst residue concentrations between 5 and 50 ppm are typical for ethylene polymer and chloride catalyst residue concentrations between 10 and 500 ppm are typical for propylene polymer and butene polymer made with Ziegler Natta catalysts. Metallic phenolate salts derived from hindered phenolic ntl oxidants in a concentration of 20 to 1000 ppm may be added to ethylene polymer compositions according to the present invention.And concentrations of 200 to 5000 ppm of metallic phenolate salts derived from hindered phenolic anti oxidant may be added to propylene polymer or butene polymer compositions. In another aspect, the present invention relates to process for extruding a film forming olefin polymer based composition into film essentially free from gel streaking and pinstriping. 7hc polymer based composttion comprises a Ziegler atta catalyzed film grade olefin polymer which contains a chloride residue in the range of between 5 and 500 ppm and at least one metallic phenolate salt derived from 2 hindered phenolic anti oxidant in the range of between 20 and 5000 ppm.The olefin polymer based composition is susceptible to ge1 etreaking during formation of the film in the presence of a hindered phenolic anti oxidant. This invention is based upon the discovery that such a process may be improved by extruding the olefin polymer based composition into the fil in the presence of a metallic phenolate salt derived from the hindered phenolic anti oxidant, as described herein. In still another aspect, it is believed that processing of Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer containing a chloride catalyst residue into film can be accomplished without corrosic of the processing equipment by incorporating a metallic phenolate salt as defined herein into the olefin polymer composition to be processed. The concentration of the metallic phenolate salt required to prevent corrosion is between 25 and 10,000 pp , based upon the olefin polymer. The metallic phenolate salt is uniformly dispersed in the olefin polymer based extrusion composition. The dispersion can be effected by various dispersion techniques commonly erploye by those skilled in the art of preparing extrudable composition.The metallic phenolate salt could be introduced into the olefin polymer either by directly dry blending with z granular olefin polymer e.g., polyethylene via a V type blender or by mixing via a Henscbel type intensive mixer. The metallic phenolate salt also could be directly hot compounded into the olefin polymer or hot compounded to make a masterbatch for final letdon using conventional hot processing equipment such as a Banbury mixer, crner Pfleiderer tvin screw mixing extruder or a single screw mixer extruder that has pelletization equipment on the head of the extruder. The Metallic Phenol ate Salt The metallic phenolate salts which nay be employed in the compositions of the present invention include a metallic salt of all those hindered phenolic anti oxidants commonly employs in oleo in polymer based film extrusion compositions. These metallic phenolate salts on reaction with a chloride catalyst residue, provide anti oxidant protection at processing tempera turps of the order of from 135 C to 340 C, or higher. The metallic phenolate salts derived from hindered phenolic anti oxidants may be used individually or in various combinations with one another or with secondary anti oxidant stabilizers in the compositions of the present invention. The metallic phenolate salt comprises an alkali metal phenolate salt, an alkaline earth metal phenolate salt, a zinc phenolate salt or mixtures thereof as cations. Suitable alkali metals include sodium, potassium or mixtures thereof as cations. Suitable alkaline earth metals include calcium magnesium, barium or mixtures thereof as cations.

The Anti Oxidants As as noted above the metallic phenolate salts function as anti gel agents and on reaction with the Ziegler Natta chloride residue, generate their respective hindered phenolic antioxidants.

Masterbatch Concentrate As previously described herein, the metallic phenolate salts of this invention may be admixed with a transition metalcatalyzed olefin polymer containing halide residue via a masterbatch concentrate to yield the extrudable film forming composition of this invention. The transition metal catalyzed olefin polymer preferably a Ziegler Natta catalyzed polymer typically is admixed with the masterbatch concentrate in a letdown ratio of between 5 and 100 to 1 by weight.Preferably, a letdown ratio of between 5 and 30 to 1 by weight is employed. The masterbatch concentrate is comprised of between 40 and 98 by weight, preferably between 609 and 95 by weight, of an olefin polymer compatible with the Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer with which the masterbatch concentrate is admixed. Compatibility of the olefin polymer can be judged by the general quality of the extruded film product in terms of the increased presence of haze, gellike defects or gross distortions of the surface texture, commonly referred to as an applesauce or sharkskin like surface. The masterbatch concentrate further includes between 0.1 and 5 by weight of a metallic phenolate salt used in this invention optionally between 0.1 and 5 by weight of a primary hindered phenolic anti oxidant and or a secondary anti oxidant and between 2 and 48 by weight, preferably between 3 and 20 by weight, of an inorganic anti block compound. Extrudable Compositions The extrudable compositions of the present invention may be used in any of the forms of such compositions which are commonly employed in the extruded film arts, such as compounds modified with various slip agents such as fatty acid amides, anti static and anti block additives for specific end use applications. These extrudable compositions are thermoplastic in nature. In addition to the olefin polymer, metallic phenolate salt, and primary and secondary anti oxidants, the compositions of the present invention may contain other adjutant materials which are commonly employed in olefin polymer based extrudable film compositions. Such other adjuvants vould include plasticizers, filler, pigments, lubricants slip agent6 modifiers and similar materials. The fillers which may be used in the olefin polymers based extrudable compositions of the present invention are the fillers which are commonly used vith such polymers. The fillers are used in amounts which correspond from 1 to 20 percent by veight, based on the weight of the olefin polymer. Such fillers would include materials such as carbon black, titanium dioxide, clays diatomaceous earth, calcium silicates and others known in the art. The lubricants which are commoly employed in the olefin polymer based extrudable compositions are the lubricants which are commonly used with such polymers. The lubricants are used in amounts which correspond from 0.02 to 0.2 percent by weight of lubricant agent based on the weight of the olefin polymer. Example of such lubricants are fatty acid amides such as stearamide, oleamide behenamide and erucamide. extruding Conditions the extrudable conditions of the present invention are particularly designed for use in equipment utilized for tubular flIr., cast film and extrusion coating products. Such equipment may have hold up areas or areas of stagnation that retard the flow of extrudate there through, leads to the development of gel streaking and pinstriping in the absence of the use of the anti gel additives of the present invention.In such equipment the olefin polymer based extrudable compositions are subjected to extrusion temperatures of from 135eC to 340 C, and preferably from 190 C to 340 C, under varying conditions of heat and pressure, and for periods of time of from 0.5 to 10 minutes. The film is usually prepared in sheets which are from 2.5 m to 250 pm thick. According to the present invention, the olefin polymer compositions are not exposed to post reactor high temperature compounding or finishing which could introduce hydroperoxides into the composition prior to film extrusion. Instead the metallic phenolate salt is added via a masterbatch concentrate or by directly dry blending it into the granular olefin polymer prior to extrusion thereof. Another advantage of this invention ic that gas treatment e.g., with propylene oxide after polymerization of the olefin polymer is not required nor are subsequent alcohol washes required to remove the propylene oxide or ethylene oxide gas products nor the subsequent drying process to remove the alcohol.Also unnecessary is the need for devolatilization of alcohols or water which could be added to neutralize the break down catalyst residue. Another advantage of the present invention is that the metallic phenol ate salts may be incorporated into the olefin polymer based resin composition without adversely affecting other additives normally used in such compositions such as slip anti block materials such as fatty asides, silica or calcium carbonate. The metallic phenolate salts do not adversely interact vith these other additives. Still another advantage of the present invention relates to molding and extrusion processing of Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer. The Ziegler Natta catalyst residue, primarily chlorides present in such olefin polymers, is liberated as hydrogen chloride during such processing. The liberated hydrogen chloride can cause removal of chrome platlng or corrosion of equipment, both in the adaptor and die sections, as well as on the chill rolls used in high temperature slot cast film extrusion. The hydrogen chloride also will adversely affect the metal and chrome plated surfaces in blow molding and injection molding equipment.The metallic phenolate salts of this invention are believed to neutralize the chloride catalyst residues and consequently prevent adverse corrosion effects in processing equipment or on a chill roll. The solubility of the metallic phenolate salts in the olefin polymers enables them to reach the catalyst sites to break down and neutralire the chloride residue. The following Examples are illustrative of the present invention and are not intended as e limitation of the scope thereof Example 1 Preparation of Metallic Phenolate Salts The metallic phenolate salts are prepared by dissolving a primary hindered phenolic anti oxidant in SO ml of acetone. A metallic cation is provided by adding alkali, alkaline and zinc metallic oxides or suitable alkanolates to the dissolved anti oxidant. The metallic oxides are added in 100 excess by using 2 equivalence of metallic oxide to each equivalence of primary hindered phenolic anti oxidant.The alkali, alkaline and zinc metallic alkanolates are used at a 25 excess on a equivalence basis. The admixture is stirred under an inert gas argon flow at 500C for a period of four hours under reflux, at which time, the means of refluxing is removed, and the acetone is evaporated to dryness under the argon flow. This drying process takes.an additional 20 hours.The dry material is ground to r powder, immediately weighed and then added to the Ziegler Natta catalyzed olefin polymer by dry blending with granular olefin polymer. Alternately, the metallic phenolate salts ctn be prepared by reaction of a primary hindered phenolic anti oxidant with alkali, alkaline or zinc alkyls. Preparation of Polymer Resins Two fov pressure, lov density ethylene butene l copolymers are prepared according to the procedure disclosed in South African Patent Publication No. 79 01365, publishedSeptember 22, 1980, entitled Process for Making Film From LowDensity Ethylene Hydrocarbon Copolymer by W.A.

Either polymer A or polymer B was is in the polymer compositions of all the subsequent illustrative examples herein. Preparation of Polymer Compositions One of two methods to prepare polymer compositions is employed in the examples. In one method, the components are dry blended in a roll drum for 20 minutes at room tempera ture with a virgin olefin polymer. In the other method, the components are compounded into masterbatch concentrates utilizing a Heake batch mixer. The components are mixed in theBrake mixer for 4 to 5 minutes, with a compound tcmperature approaching 123 C. Aftcr 5 minutes, the material is removed from the mixer and icnediattly pressed into a 50 mil sheet in steam heated Wabash hydraulic press. Thereupon, the sheet is granulated in a Cumberland grinder.The base resin contained in the ground sheet the masterbatch concentrate is a high pressure, low density ethylene polymer having r melt index of 3 2.0 and a density of 0.918 gm cm commercially available under the trade name DED 4140 from Union Carbide Corporation,Old Ridgebury Road, Danbury Connecticut 06810 .

Table II below summarizes typical results for a number of control formulations which do not contain the metallic phenolate salt anti gell anti oxidant compound of this invention.The control formula tions are prepared by the method described hereinabove. After the formulations are prepared, films are extruded in a tubular extrusion device for various periods of time to assess gel formation.
