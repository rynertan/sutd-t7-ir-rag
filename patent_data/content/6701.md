# A process for channelling ion beams.

## Abstract
The specification describes a process and apparatus for minimizing ion scattering and thereby improving resolu tion in ion beam lithography. First, a substrate 12 coated with a layer of ion beam resist 10 is provided at a chosen spaced distance from an ion beam source. Next, a mono crystalline membrane 2 with a patterned ion absorption region is positioned at a predetermined location between the substrate 12 and the ion beam source. The patterned ion absorption region may be either an ion absorption mask 4 , such as gold, deposited on the surface of the monocrystalline membrane 2 , or a pattern of ion dama ged regions 4 within the monocrystalline membrane 2 . Finally, a collimated wide area ion beam 6 is passed per pendicular to the surface of the membrane 2 and through crystal lattice channels 8 therein which are exposed by the patterned ion absorption region and which extend per pendicular to the membrane surface. The parallel paths established by the channels in the membrane 2 provide low resistance paths to the passage of ion beams and con sequently minimize the angle of deflection of the ions pass ing from the membrane 2 to the target resist layer 10 .
