# ADJUSTABLE SUPPORTING STRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY FOR PARABOLIC ANTENNAS

## Abstract
Adjustable supporting structure, particularly for para bolic antennas, comprising a pole 2 supporting on one end suitable means for the orientation of a parabolic reflector and characterized in that said means of orientation comprise a supporting member 3 engaging coaxially said pole, a body 7 revolvingly engaging said supporting member so as to define a first axis of rotation and a pivot 10 engaging said body and revolvingly supporting a support connection 11 rigidly secured to said parabolic reflector 12 , said pivot defining a second axis of rotation which is perpendicular to the first axis of rotation and said structure also comprising first and second engagement members 13,20 acting, re spectively, between said body and said supporting member and between said body and said connecting member and capable of both locking and adjusting the position of said body, supporting member and support connection.
