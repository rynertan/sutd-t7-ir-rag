# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CMOS MULTISTAGED DYNAMIC LOGIC CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A dynamic logic circuit comprising a plurality of logic structures having different conductivity types coupled alternately in series is described. All stages of the dynamic logic circuit are precharged simultaneously. An evaluation signal applied to the first stage will cause the first stage to move from its precharged level to an active level. If the input conditions of the first and all succeeding stages are met, the first and all of the succeeding stages will begin to evaluate as each preceding stage moves through the threshold of the succeeding stage.
