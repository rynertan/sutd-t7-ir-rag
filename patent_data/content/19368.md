# A thermosetting polyurethane resin coating agent.

## Abstract
A thermosetting one pack polyurethane resin coating agent comprising a thermosetting polyurethane resin which may be in the form of an aqueous dispersion substantially free of non aqueous solvent and which exhibits resistance to clouding and damage when used as coating agent for bottles or containers made from glass or other inorganic material which are subjected to sterilization by hot water. The resin contains from 10 to 40 by weight, relative to the non volatile matter of the resin, of polyoxyalkylene glycol of which 1 to 8 by weight relative to the non volatile components of the resin is either poloyoxethylene glycol, or polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycol, or a mixture thereof. The resin also contains diisocyanate in the form of a mixture of methylene bis 4 cyclohexylisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate in a molar ratio of from 1 0.3 to 1 1.5, a monofunctional isocyanate blocking agent, a chain elongating agent and a crosslinking agent.
