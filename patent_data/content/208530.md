# Squelch detecting circuit with squelch start determining means.

## Abstract
A squelch detecting circuit comprises a narrow bandpass filter 16 for obtaining, as a filtered signal, a desired IF carrier frequency signal. The filtered signal is envelope detected at a detector 17 and the detected signal is compared with a predetermined squelch level at a voltage comparator 21 . The voltage comparator produces a first signal when the detected signal is below the squelch level and produces a second signal when the detected signal is above the squelch level. A squelch start determining circuit 22 produces a squelch alarm signal after the first signal is continued for a predetermined time period, and the squelch alarm signal is maintained until the second signal is inputted to the squelch start determining circuit 22 , so that the transmitter and receiver characteristic test using the carrier frequency sweeping can be performed without any squelch alarm signal produced.
