# Process for removal of sulfur and ash from coal.

## Abstract
A process for reducing the sulfur and ash content of coal wherein coal particles are treated in a aqueous slurry with a minor amount of hydrocarbon oil to form coal oil aggregates of enlarged effective particle size and the coal oil aggregates are then separated from ash and mineral matter in the slurry. Optionally, the coal particles are treated, prior to the aggregation step, with a conditioning agent which modifies or alters the surface characteristics of the ash and pyritic sulfur mineral matter. Recovered coal particles comprise a substantial part of the feed carbon values.
