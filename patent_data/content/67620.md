# Secondary arc extinction device.

## Abstract
A multiphase transmission line has means for extin guishing a secondary arc between a conductor and earth which comprise a first reactance connected to each phase conductor, a second reactance connected between the first reactance and earth and means for adusting the value of the second reactance in response to the current f low through the second reactance and the voltage of the conductor when an arc is detected between the arc and earth.
