# METALLIZED FILM WOUND CAPACITOR HAVING MINIMIZED INDUCTIVE REACTANCE AND METHOD THEREFOR

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for making a wound capacitor 10 having decreased inherent inductance and a high self resonant frequency. In making this capacifor, metallized film is wound around a non conductive polycarbonate core 14 and a conductor 12 is inserted through the entire length of the core 14 . The wound metallized film is flattened and ter minals 16, 18 are formed at opposite ends of the flattened wound capacitor. The conductor is folded over and electric ally connected to one terminal 18 and a metal contact is electrically connected to the other terminal 16 . The electro magnetic field created around the conductor is approximate ly equal and in the opposite direction to the electromagnetic field created around the wound metallized film. Therefore, the inductive reactance of the conductor and the inductive reactance of the wound film are approximately equal. These reactances approximately cancel resulting in increased self resonant frequency.
