# Digital delta modulation compander.

## Abstract
Delay circuits 21 and 22 and logic gates 23, 24, 25 provide an output which is representative of three suc cessive like bits appearing on the compander input line. Multiplier 26 multiplies the current delta step value Δ by ¹ ₁₆ and multiplier 27 multiplies the same by ¹ ₆₄. When the output of logic gate 25 is a 1, three like bits , AND gate 28 let the output of multiplier 26 apply to three input adder 31 . The output of this adder then delivers a delta step signal
