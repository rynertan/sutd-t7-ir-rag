# Novel random 1 butene copolymer.

## Abstract
A random copolymer consisting essentially of more than 60 to 99 mole of 1 butene and less than 40 to 1 mole of propylene, and having A a boiling methyl acetate soluble content of not more than 2 by weight based on the weight of the copolymer, B an intrinsic viscosity η , determined in decalin at 135 C, of 0.5 to 6 dl g, C a n decane acetone 1 1 by volume mixture soluble content in by weight based on the weight of the copolymer of less than the value calculated by 4 η ¹², D a DSC melting point, determined by a differential scanning calorimeter, of 50 to 130 C, E a yield strength, measured by JIS K 7113, of 50 to 300 kg cm², F an elongation at break, measured by JIS K 7113, of 200 to 1000 , and G a tensile strength at break, measure by JIS K 7113 of 150 to 800 kg cm², can be shaped into articles such as pipes, sheets, films and hollow containers and is suitable as a packaging film.
