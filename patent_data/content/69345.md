# Power transfer assembly in particular for a helicopter deicer system.

## Abstract
A device 10 for isolating from vibrational and impulse loads a power transfer unit 14 that transfers power from a helicopter electrical system to a plurality of deicing segments on the rotor blades includes a distributor 13 rotating with the rotor blades for distributing power from the power transfer unit 14 to the deicing segments, a housing 11 having an upper cylinder 24 and lower cylinder 23 the latter of which is flexibly secured to the helicopter as by a joint including ball 40 , housing 11 substantially isolating the power transfer unit 14 from such loads, and a shaft 12 rotatably engaging the upper cylinder 24 for carrying the distributor 13 in rotation with the rotor blades.
