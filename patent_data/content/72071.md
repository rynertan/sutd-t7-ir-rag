## Description
method for the continuous production of preforms for the ma aiifarture of optical fibres while depositing glass layers onto a ylindrical starting rod The invention relates to a method of producing preforms for the manufacture of optical fibres by means of a flame hydrolysis or oxidation process wherein a plurality of layers of glass particles having a composition in conformity with the desired refractive index profile are deposited onto a rotating cylindrical starting rod by means of a turner to which a mixture of glass forming materials is supplied, the rod is removed after a number of layers sufficient for the object aimed at have been deposited, the member obtained is sintered and the sintered body is used to manufacture an optical fibre either by direct drawing of the member in which the central hole collapses or by first collapsing the member into a solid preform and drawing the preform. United States Patent Specification 3,826,560 discloses f.e. a method in which a mixture of suitable starting materials SiC14, By13, P0C13, GeCl4, 2 is caused to reat in a flame cH4 o2 or H9 02 , fine glass particles of a high purity then being formed. The flow of hot glass particles is directed onto a starting rod rotating about its longitudinal axis and which translates with respect to the burner. A porous, coherent, cylindrical member of glass particles consisting of successively deposited layers is formed on tbe rod.By varying the flows of starting materials to the burner, the refractive index of the deposited glass particles can be varied according to the requirements. In this manner, it is possible to produce preforms for the manufacture of stepped index Fibres and of graded index fibres. The porous preform is removed from the cylindrical starting rod and sintered into a solid preform and drawn into a fibre. During sintering the preform may be subjected to an additional special chlorine treatment in order to reduce the water content to a sufficiently low value. The known method has the disadvantage that in this form it is not continuous. It is a known fact in the chemical processing industry that the constantness of quality of a product is considerably improved if the product can be produced continuoasLy from the raw materials. Considered from this point of view a process in which material is deposited batchwise is inferior to processes which may in principle be effected continuously such as, for e c ample the double crucible method and the vapour axial deposition technique see UnitedStates Patent Specification 4,069,665 . The present invention has therefore for its object to provide a method of the above mentioned type which is suitable for continuous production. This object is ancomplished by means of a method which is chara erized in that an endless starting rod rotating about its longitudinal axis is passed at a constant rate through a glass deposition zone in which zone at least one burner is reciprocated over a fixed distance parallel to t translation direction of the starting rod, glass particles being deposited onto the starting rod at least when the burner s is are moved contrarily to the direction in which the starting rod moves. An endless rod is here understood to mean a rod which during the deposition process is extended by fitting an additional section to it at regular intervals.This can, for example, be realized by means of extender sections one end of which is provided with a threaded, narrowed portion and the other end with an axial opening having an internal screwthread into which the narrowed portion of an extender section can be scrawled. The burner may be in the form of a flame hydro lysis burner described in TJ nited States Patent Specification 3,826,560 or in the form of a plasma burner see Kikuchi Fujitsu ci. Tech. J. 11, 99 1975 , the plasma being obtained with a electric R.F. field, or a plasma burner in which the plasma is obtained by means of an electric field having a frequency in the microwave range.In this coimnection, a burner is generally understood to mean an arrazgement to srhich the starting materials SiC14, BC13, POOl3, GeC14, Sift, 02 are applied and in which the starting materials are reacted with each other while forming a stream of glass particles as a high temperature. If in the method according to the invention glass particles are only deposited onto the cylindrical starting rod during movement of the burner contrarily to the direction of translation of the rod, the formation of glass particles must be regularly interrupted. Such an interruption may be effected by interrupting the supply of glassoforfning mate rial to the burner during the back stroke of the burner. In this embodiment the composition of the mixture of gla3s forming materials must however be modified rather abruptly in view of the required difference in refractive indices between the circumference of the preform and the core thereof. If, in addition, a high yield of deposited glass particles per unit of time is aimed at, one wants to return the burner, after a deposition run has been performed at a predetermined speed of the burner, at a greater speed to its starting position. Consequently, the control of the manufacturing process in this embodiment is rather complicated. Therefore, in a prefgrred embodiment of the method according to the invention, glass particles are deposited soth when the burner moves contrarily to the direction of translation of the rod and when the burner moves in the same direction as the direction of transla tio of the rod. This embodiment has the following advantages The process is controllable to a better extent, particularly when manufacturing graded index fibres in which the composition of the mixture of glass forming materials can be changed continuously, both during the forwad d the backward strokes of the burner.With this embodiment it is however also possible to produce stepped index Qibes. In that event the composition of the mixture of glass forming materials is always constant during a part of the deposition period. The composition is rapidly modified at the transition from the core glass the cladding glass and vice versa. An abrupt transition is however not necessary. This is bound up with the fact that in the method according to the invention the layers are applied at an nile the concentration gradient perpendicularly to the axis is ten automatically steeper than towards the layers. A further advantage is the higher yield of deposited glass particles per unit of time. The preferred embodiment of the method is preferably performed in such a manner that the speed at which the burner moves betwean the points at which the movement reverses is kept constant to the best possible extent and the gas composition is varied continuously graded index or regularly in steps stepped index . The speed at which the burner moves, the width of the path of deposited glass particles, the translation speed of the cylindrical starting rod and the rotational speed of the rod are preferably brought into harmony in such a manner that the glass particles are deposited in only slightly overlapping parts at an angle to the asis of the rod. The relevant angle may be for example between 50 and 45 , although for efficiency the angle must not be chosen too wide. The translation of the rod during a complete r otatlon should thereby be somewhat smaller than the width of the deposited path of glass particles. The invention will now be explained in greater detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing. In the drawings Fig. 1 shows schematically an arrangement for applying a layer of glass particles on an endless cylin dical starting rod. Fig. 2 shows in detail a possibility of extending the rod. Fig. 3 shows schematically an arrangement with three burners. Fig. 4 shows graphically the variation in the dopant concentration during the production of a graded index fibre. Fig. 5 shows graphically the variation in the dopant concentration during the production of a stepped index fibre. Fig. 1 shows schematically an arrangernent for applying a layer of glass particles on a verticaLly arranged endless cylindrical starting rod 1. Rod 1 is formed from a number of extension embers LA, 1B, etc. which during the deposition process are fitted at regular intervals, depending on the speed of translation the translation direction is shown in Figure 1 by means of an arrow pointing vertically down towards the bottom of the sheet .For this purpose the extension members lA, and 1B may be provided at one end with an opening having an internal screwthread 2 see Fig. 2 while the other end has a reduced diameter over a small part of its length and is externally provided with a screwthread 3. The extension members may consist of quartz, ceramic material for example sintered Al203 , carbon or of a metal coated with a SIC or carbon la yer or another material which prevents diffusion of metal ions into the deposited glass. In addition, the arrangement shown in Fig. 1 has a burner 4 flame hydrolysis burner which can be reciprocated in a programmed manner along a vertical path . Tne burner 4 is connected by meals of flexible pipes 6 and 7 to a gas supply arrangement which is partly shown in Fig. 1. A mixture of a combustible gas H9, CH4 with oxygen is supplied to the burner 4 via the pipe 6.A mixture of oxygen and vapours of materials which, when reacted çith oxygen form glass particles is fed via the flexible pipe 7 to the bunker 4. Fig. L further shows schematically two containers 8 and 9 the number of containers may of course be larger depending on the number of dopants one wants to use .Container 8 holds SiC14 and container 9 holds GeCl4.Oxygen is bubbled through the liquids via supply pipes 10 and 11. These supply pipes comprise controllable valves and controllers 12 and 13, 13A which are commonly referred to as mass flow controllers, by means of which it is possible to control the flow rate of the oxygen and consequently the quantities of metered SiC14 andGeCl4 accurately by means of a control unit 14. The oxygen vapour mixture is fed to the burner 4 via the pipe 7. Glass particles formed in the burner 4 are deposited onto the rod I. The rod 1 is supported by a rotating table 15 and is rotated by three supporting wheels two of which, 16 and 17, are shown in Figure 1 the table 15 is translated vertically downwards. Fig. 1 shows one burner, it is however advantageous to arrange several burners, for example three burners, aground the cylindrlcal starting rod, the burners are always supplied with the same gas va p our mixture. Fig. 3 shows such an arrangement. Three burners 4A, 4B and 4C are fitted on a ring 26 which is connected to three rods 27, 28 and 29 which can be moved by means of a drive, not shown. The reference numerals in Figure 3 have the same meaning as in Figure 1. In this arrangement the burners 4A, 4B and 4C move simultaneously along the starting rod 1.It may be advantageous if the burners are not arranged in the same plane perpendicularly to the tarring rod, bat are so disposed with respect to each other that three layers are deposited on top of each other. The burners shown in Fig. 3 are directed at an angle of 120 with respect to each other at the starting rod. Fig. 4 shows schematically the variation of the dopant concentration. According as the deposited ath of glass particles approaches closer to the starting rod 1 the dopant concentration D increases. Thereafter a second path is deposited on the last path, the dopant concentra tion remains the same, thereafter the dopant concentration decreases again. In this way a graded index fibre can The obtained. The diameter of the preform is indicated by d. Fig. 5 shows schematically the variation of the dopant concentration D during the manufacture of a stepped index fibre. After an initially lo level cladding the dopant concentration increases to a higher value core , remains constant for so time and decreases thereafter again. In a given embodiment of the method the length of an extension member consisting of sintered Awl 0 is 100 cm and its diameter 2 cm. The burner which deposits a 1 cm wide path of glass particles reciprocates over a distance of 40 cm at a speed of 4 cm per sec., the rotationaL speed of the starting rod 1 is then 4 revolutions per sec. and the translation speed 0.1 cm sec.A preform 20 having a total diameter of 10 cm is obtained.At regular intervals a portion of the preform 20 is cut off, for example having a length of 100 cm. The starting rod 1 contained in this preform portion is removed and the preform is sintered in a customary manner and drawn into a fibre, for example in the manner as described in USP 3,826,560.
