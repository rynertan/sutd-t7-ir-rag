## Description
This invention relates to a light receiving member having sensitivity to electromagnetic waves such as light herein used in a broad sense, including ultraviolet rays, visible light, infrared rays, X rays and gamma rays . More particularly, it pertains to a light receiving member suitable for using a coherent light such as laser beam. As the method for recording a digital image information as an image, there have been well known the methods in which an electrostatic latent image is formed by scanning optically a light receiving member with a laser beam modulated corresponding to a digital image information, then said latent image is developed, followed by processing such as transfer or fixing, if desired, to record an image. Among them, in the image forming method employing electrophotography, image recording has been generally practiced with the use of a small size and inexpensive He Ne laser or a semiconductor laser generally having an emitted wavelength of 650 820 nm . In particular, as the light receiving member for electrophotography which is suitable when using a semiconductor laser, an amorphous material containing silicon atoms hereinafter written briefly as A Si as disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent Application NOs. 86341 1979 and 83746 1981 is attracting attention for its high Vickers hardness and non polluting properties in social aspect in addition to the advantage of being by far superior in matching in its photosensitive region as compared with other kinds of light receiving members. However, when the photosensitive layer is made of a single A Si layer,for ensuring dark resistance of 10¹² ohm cm or higher required for electrophotography while maintaining high photosensitivity, it is necessary to incorporate structurally hydrogen atoms or halogen atoms or boron atoms in addition thereto in controlled form within specific ranges of amounts. Accordingly, control of layer formation is required to be performed severely, whereby tolerance in designing of a light receiving member is considerably limited. As attempts to enlarge this tolerance in designing, namely to enable effective utilization of its high photosensitivity in spite of somewhat lower dark resistance, there have been proposed a light receiving layer with a multi layer structure of two or more laminated layers with different conductivity characteristics with formation of a depletion layer within the light receiving layer, as disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent Application Nos. 121743 1979, 4053 1982 and 4172 1982, or a light receiving member with a multi layer structure in which a barrier layer is provided between the substrate and the photosensitive layer and or on the upper surface of the photosensitive layer, thereby enhancing apparent dark resistance of the light receiving layer as a whole, as disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent Application Nos. 52178 1982, 52179 1982, 52180 1982, 58159 1982, 58160 1982 and 58161 1982. According to such proposals, A Si type light receiving members have been greatly advanced in tolerance in designing of commercialization thereof or easiness in management of its production and productivity, and the speed of development toward commercialization is now further accelerated. When carrying out laser recording by use of such a light receiving member having a light receiving layer of a multi layer structure, due to irregularity in thickness of respective layers, and also because of the laser beam which is an coherent monochromatic light, it is possible that the respective reflected lights reflected from the free surface on the laser irradiation side of the light receiving layer and the layer interface between the respective layers constituting the light receiving layer and between the substrate and the light receiving layer hereinafter interface is used to mean comprehensively both the free surface and the layer interface may undergo interference. Such an interference phenomenon results in the so called interference fringe pattern in the visible image formed and causes a poor iamge. In particular, in the case of forming a medium tone image with high gradation, bad appearance of the image will become marked. Moreover, as the wavelength region of the semiconductor laser beam is shifted toward longer wavelength, absorption of said laser beam in the photosensitive layer becomes reduced, whereby the above interference phenomenon becomes more marked. This point is explained by referring to the drawings. Fig. 1 shows a light I₀ entering a certain layer constituting the light receiving layer of a light receiving member, a reflected light R₁ from the upper interface 102 and a reflected light R₂ reflected from the lower interface 101. Now, the average layer thickness of the layer is defined as In the light receiving member of a multi layer structure, the interference effect as shown in Fig. 1 occurs at each layer, and there ensues a synergistic deleterious influence through respective interferences as shown in Fig. 2. For this reason, the interference fringe corresponding to said interference fringe pattern appears on the visible image transferred and fixed on the transfer member to cause bad images. As the method for cancelling such an inconvenience, it has been proposed to subject the surface of the substrate to diamond cutting to provide unevenness of 500 Å 10000 Å, thereby forming a light scattering surface as disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent Application No. 162975 1983 to provide a light absorbing layer by subjecting the aluminum substrate surface to black Alumite treatment or dispersing carbon, color pigment or dye in a resin as disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent Application No. 165845 1982 and to provide a light scattering reflection preventive layer on the substrate surface by subjecting the aluminum substrate surface to satin like Alumite treatment or by providing a sandy fine unevenness by sand blast as disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent Application No. 16554 1982 . However, according to these methods of the prior art, the interference fringe pattern appearing on the image could not completely be cancelled. For example, because only a large number of unevenness with specific sized are formed on the substrate surface according to the first method, although prevention of appearance of interference fringe through light scattering is indeed effected, regular reflection light component yet exists. Therefore, in addition to remaining of the interference fringe by said regular reflection light, enlargement of irradiated spot occurs due to the light scattering effect on the surface of the substrate to be a cause for substantial lowering of resolution. As for the second method, such a black Alumite treatment is not sufficinent for complete absorption, but reflected light from the substrate surface remains. Also, there are involved various inconveniences. For example, in providing a resin layer containing a color pigment dispersed therein, a phenomenon of degassing from the resin layer occurs during formation of the A Si photosensitive layer to markedly lower the layer quality of the photosensitive layer formed, and the resin layer suffers from a damage by the plasma during formation of A Si photosensitive layer to be deteriorated in its inherent absorbing function. Besides, worsening of the surface state deleteriously affects subsequent formation of the A Si photosensitive layer. In the case of the third method of irregularly roughening the substrate surface, as shown in Fig. 3, for example, the incident light I₀ is partly reflected from the surface of the light receiving layer 302 to become a reflected light R₁, with the remainder progressing internally through the light receiving layer 302 to become a transmitted light I₁. The transmitted light I₁ is partly scattered on the surface of the substrate 301 to become scattered lights K₁, K₂, K₃ ... K On the other hand, if diffusibility of the surface of the substrate 301 is increased in order to prevent multiple reflections within the light receiving layer 302 through prevention of interference, light will be diffused within the light receiving layer 302 to cause halation, whereby resolution is disadvantageously lowered. Particularly, in a light receiving member of a multi layer structure, as shown in Fig. 4, even if the surface of the substrate 401 may be irregularly roughened, the reflected light R₂ from the first layer 402, the reflected light R₁ from the second layer 403 and the regularly reflected light R₃ from the surface of the substrate 401 are interfered with each other to form an interference fringe pattern depending on the respective layer thicknesses of the light receiving member. Accordingly, in a light receiving member of a multi layer structure, it was impossible to completely prevent appearance of interference fringes by irregularly roughening the surface of the substrate 401. In the case of irregularly roughening the substrate surface according to the method such as sand blasting, etc., the roughness will vary so much from lot to lot, and there is also nonuniformity in roughness even in the same lot, and therefore production control could be done with inconvenience. In addition, relatively large projections with random distributions are frequently formed, hence causing local breakdown of the light receiving layer during charging treatment. On the other hand, in the case of simply roughening the surface of the substrate 501 regularly, as shown in Fig. 5, since the light receiving layer 502 is deposited along the uneven shape of the surface of the substrate 501, the slanted plane of the unevenness of the substrate 501 becomes parallel to the slanted plane of the unevenness of the light receiving layer 502. Accordingly, for the incident light on that portion, 2nd₁ mλ or 2nd₁ m 1 2 λ holds, to make it a light portion or a dark portion. Also, in the light receiving layer as a whole, since there is nonuniformity in which the maximum difference among the layer thicknesses d₁, d₂, d₃ and d₄ of the light receiving layer is λ 2n or more, there appears a light and dark fringe pattern. Thus, it is impossible to completely extinguish the interference fringe pattern by only roughening regularly the surface of the substrate 501. Also, in the case of depositing a light receiving layer of a multi layer structure on the substrate, the surface of which is regularly roughened, in addition to the interference between the regularly reflected light from the substrate surface and the reflected light from the light receiving layer surface as explained for light receiving member of a single layer structure in Fig. 3, interferences by the reflected lights from the interfaces between the respective layers participate to make the extent of appearance of interferance fringe pattern more complicated than in the case of the light receiving member of a single layer structure. In one aspect, the present invention aims to provide a novel light receiving member sensitive to light, which has cancelled the drawbacks as described above. In another aspect, the present invention aims to provide a light receiving member which is suitable for image formation by use of a coherent monochromatic light and also easy in production management. In another aspect, the present invention aims to provide a light receiving member which can cancel the interference fringe pattern appearing during image formation and appearance of speckles on reversal developing at the same time and completely. In another aspect, the present invention aims to provide a light receiving member which is high in dielectric strength and photosensitivity and excellent in electrophotographic characteristics. In another aspect, the present invention aims to provide a light receiving member, which can provide an image of high quality which is high in density, clear in halftone and high in resolution and is suitable for electrophotography. In another aspect, the present invention aims to provide a light receiving member which is capable of reducing light reflection from the surface of the light receiving member and utilizing incident light efficiently. According to the present invention there is provided a light receiving member for exposure to light to form an image, comprising a substrate having a large number of protruding portions being arranged in regular periods D, each of the protruding portions having at a predetermined cut position a sectional shape comprising a reverse V shaped projection, the size ℓ of the short range regions constituted by the slopes of the protruding portions being not greater than the image resolution required, and a light receiving layer of plural layer structure having a first layer comprising an amorphous material containing silicon atoms and germanium atoms, a second layer comprising an amorphous material containing silicon atoms and exhibiting photoconductivity and a surface layer having a reflection preventive function, the layers being respectively in order from the substrate side, said light receiving layer containing atoms of at least one element selected from oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, the thickness of the layers of the plural layer structure within the minute portion ℓ being such that at least one pair of non parallel layer interfaces e.g. 603, 604 of Figure 6 results. The invention also provides an electrophotographic system comprising a light receiving member as aforesaid and having an optical system whose resolution is not greater than the image resolution of the light receiving member. The invention further provides a laser printer having a light receiving member as aforesaid, the laser having a spot size that is not greater than the image resolution of the light receiving member. Our EP B 0155758 provides a light receiving member to be scanned by a laser spot, comprising a substrate and a light receiving layer of plural layer structure having at least one photosensitive layer comprising an amorphous material containing silicon atoms, said photosensitive layer having uneven layer interfaces, a single section of said layer having a pitch ℓ L, L being the laser spot diameter, characterised in that sections of the interfaces alternate in the direction of thickness such that a layer of continuously changing thickness results. The invention will now be further described with reference to the drawings, in which Referring now to the accompanying drawings, the present invention is to be described in detail. Fig. 6 is a schematic illustration for explanation of the basic principle of the present invention. In the present invention, on a substrate not shown having a fine uneven shape smaller than the resolution required for the device, a light receiving layer of a multi layer constitution is provided along the uneven slanted plane, with the thickness of the second layer 602 being continuously changed from d₅ to d₆, as shown enlarged in a part of Fig. 6, and therefore the interface 603 and the interface 604 have respective gradients. Accordingly, the coherent light incident on this minute portion short range region ℓ indicated schematically in Fig. 6 C , and its enlarged view shown in Fig. 6 A undergoes interference at said minute portion ℓ to form a minute interference fringe pattern. Also, as shown in Fig. 7, when the interface 703 between the first layer 701 and the second layer 702 and the free surface 704 are non parallel to each other, the reflected light R₁ and the emitted lgiht R₃ are different in direction of progress from each other relative to the incident light I₀ as shown in Fig. 7 A , and therefore the degree of interference will be reduced as compared with the case Fig. 7 B when the interfaces 703 and 704 are parallel to each other. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 7 C , as compared with the case B where a pair of the interfaces are in parallel relation, the difference in lightness and darkness in the interference fringe pattern becomes negligibly small even if interfered, if any, in the non parallel case A . The same is the case, as shown in Fig. 6, even when the layer thickness of the layer 602 may be macroscopically ununiform d₇ d₈ , and therefore the incident light quantity becomes uniform all over the layer region see Fig. 6 D . To describe about the effect of the present invention when coherent light is transmitted from the irradiation side to the first layer in the case of a light receiving layer of a multi layer structure, reflected lights R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄ and R₅ exsit in connection with the incident light I₀. Accordingly, at the respective layers, the same phenomenon as described with reference to Fig. 7 occurs. Therefore, when considered for the light receiving layer as a whole, interference occurs as a synergetic effect of the respective layers and, according to the present invention, appearance of interference can further be prevented as the number of layers constituting the light receiving layer is increased. The interference fringe occurring within the minute portion cannot appear on the image, because the size of the minute portion is smaller than the spot size of the irradiated light, namely smaller than the resolution limit. Further, even if appeared on the image, there is no problem at all, since it is less than resolving ability of the eyes. In the present invention, the slanted plane of unevenness should desirably be mirror finished in order to direct the reflected light assuredly in one direction. The size ℓ one cycle of uneven shape of the minute portion suitable for the present invention is 2 L, wherein L is the spot size of the irradiation light. Further, in order to accomplish more effectively the objects of the present invention, the layer thickness difference d₅ d₆ at the minute portion 1 should desirably be as follows In the present invention, within the layer thickness of the minute portion ℓ hereinafter called as minute column in the light receiving layer of a multi layer structure, the layer thicknesses of the respective layers are controlled so that at least two interfaces between layers may be in non parallel relationship, and, provided that this condition is satisfied, any other pair of two interfaces between layers may be in parallel relationship within said minute column. However, it is desirable that the layers forming parallel interfaces should be formed to have uniform layer thicknesses so that the difference in layer thickness at any two positions may be not more than For formation of the respective layers of the first layer and the second layer constituting the light receiving layer, in order to accomplish more effectively and easily the objects of the present invention, the plasma chemical vapor deposition method PCVD method , the optical CVD method and thermal CVD method can be employed, because the layer thickness can accurately be controlled on the optical level thereby. The unevenness to be provided on the substrate surface can be formed by fixing a bite having a V shaped cutting blade at a predetermined position on a cutting working machine such as milling machine, lathe, etc., and cut working accurately the substrate surface by, for example, moving regularly in a certain direction while rotating a cylindrical substrate according to a program previously designed as desired, thereby forming to a desired unevenness shape, pitch and depth. The reverse V shaped linear projection produced by the unevenness formed by such a cutting working has a spiral structure with the center axis of the cylindrical substrate as its center. The spiral structure of the reverse V shaped projection may be made into a mutiple spiral structure such as double or triple structure or a crossed spiral structure. Alternatively, a straight line structure along the center axis may also be introduced in addition to the spiral structure. The shape of the longitudinal section of the protruded portion of the unevenness provided on the substrate surface is made reverse V shape in order to ensure managed ununiformization of layer thickness within minute columns of respective layers and good adhesion as well as desired electrical contact between the substrate and the layer provided directly on said substrate, and it should preferably be made as shown in Fig. 9 as isosceles triangle, a right triangle or a scalene triangle. Of these shapes, an isosceles triangle and a right triangle are preferred. In the present invention, the respective dimensions of the unevenness provided on the substrate surface under managed condition are set so as to accomplish effectively the objects of the present invention in view of the following points. More specifically, in the first place, the A Si layer constituting the light receiving layer is sensitive to the structure of the surface on which the layer formation is effected, and the layer quality will be changed greatly depending on the surface condition. Accordingly, it is desirable to set dimensions of the unevenness to be provided on the substrate surface so that lowering in layer quality of the A Si layer may not be brought about. Secondly, when there is extreme unevenness on the free surface of the light receiving layer, cleaning cannot frequently be performed completely in cleaning step after image formation. Further, in case of practicing blade cleaning, there is involved the problem that the blade will be damaged more earlier. As the result of investigations of the problems is layer deposition as described above, problems in process of electrophotography and the conditions for prevention of interference fringe pattern, it has been found that the pitch at the recessed portion on the substrate surface should preferably be 500 µm to 0.3 µm, more preferably 200 µm to 1 µm, most preferably 50 µm to 5 µm. It is also desirable that the maximum depth of the recessed portion should preferably be made 0.1 µm to 5 µm, more preferably 0.3 µm to 3 µm, most preferably 0.6 µm to 2 µm. When the pitch and the maximum depth of the recessed portions on the substrate surface are within the ranges as specified above, the gradient of the slanted plane at the recessed portion or linear projection may preferably be 1 to 20 , more preferably 3 to 15 , most preferably 4 to 10 . On the other hand, the maximum of the difference in the layer thickness based on such an uniformness in layer thickness of the respective layers formed on such a substrate should preferably be made 0.1 µm to 2 µm within the same pitch, more preferably 0.1 µm to 1.5 µm, most preferably 0.2 µm to 1 µm. The thickness of the surface layer having reflection preventive function should preferably be determined as follows in order to exhibit fully its reflection preventive function. When the refractive index of the material for the surface layer is defined as Also, as the material for the surface layer, when the second layer on which the surface layer is to be deposited is defined as n By taking such optical conditions into considerations, the layer thickness of the reflection preventive layer may preferably be 0.05 to 2 µm, provided that the wavelength of the light for exposure is within the wavelength region of from near infrared light to visible light. In the present invention, the material to be effectively used as having reflection preventive function may include, for example, inorganic fluorides, inorganic oxides or inorganic nitrides such as MgF₂, Al₂O₃, ZrO₂, TiO₂, ZnS, CeO₂, CeF₂, SiO₂, SiO, Ta₂O₅, AlF₃, NaF, Si₃N₄ and the like or organic compounds such as polyvinyl chloride, polyamide resin, polyimide resin, vinylidene fluoride, melamine resin, epoxy resin, phenol resin, cellulose acetate and others. These materials can be formed into the surface layer according to the vapor deposition method, the sputtering method, the plasma chemical vapor deposition method PCVD , the optical CVD method, the thermal CVD method and the coating method, since the layer thickness can be controlled accurately at optical level in order to accomplish the objects of the present invention more effectively. Further, the light receiving layer in the light receiving member of the present invention has a multi layer structure comprising a first layer constituted of an amorphous material containing silicon atoms and germanium atoms and a second layer constituted of an amorphous material containing silicon atoms and exhibiting photoconductivity provided on a substrate successively from the substrate side, and therefore can exhibit very excellent electrical, optical and photoconductive characteristics, dielectric strength as well as good use environmental characteristics. In particular, when it is applied as a light receiving member for electrophotography, there is no influence of residual potential on image formation at all, with its electrical properties being stable with high sensitivity and high SN ratio, also excellent in light fatigue resistance and repeated use characteristics, whereby it is possible to obtain repeatedly and stably images of high quality with high density, clear halftone and high resolution. Further, the light receiving member of the present invention is high in photosensitivity over the all visible light regions, particularly in photosensitivity to the light of longer wavelength region and is therefore excellent in matching to semiconductor laser and also rapid in light response. Referring now the drawings, the light receiving member of the present invention is to be described in detail. Fig. 10 is a schematic illustration of construction for explanation of the layer constitution of the light receiving member according to an embodiment of the present invention. The light receiving member shown in Fig. 10 has a light receiving layer 1000 on a substrate 1001 for light receiving member 1004, the light receiving member having a free surface 1005 on one end surface thereof. The light receiving layer has a layer structure, having a first layer G 1002 constituted of an amorphous material containing silicon atoms and germanium atoms, optionally together with hydrogen atoms and or halogen atoms X hereinafter abbreviated as A SiGe H,X , a second layer S 1003 constituted of A Si optionally containing hydrogen atoms and or halogen atoms X hereinafter abbreviated as A Si H,X and having photoconductivity and a surface layer 1006 having reflection preventive function laminated successively from the substrate 1001 side. The germanium atoms contained in the first layer G 1002 may be contained so that the distribution state may be uniform within the first layer G , or they can be contained continuously in the layer thickness direction in said first layer G 1002, being more enriched at the substrate 1001 side toward the side opposite to the side where said substrate 1001 is provided the surface 1005 side of the light receiving layer 1001 . When the distribution state of the germanium atoms contained in the first layer G is ununiform in the layer thickness direction, it is desirable that the distribution state should be made uniform in the interplanar direction in parallel to the surface of the substrate. In the present invention, in the second layer S provided on the first layer G , no germanium atoms is contained and by forming a light receiving layer to such a layer structure, the light receiving member obtained can be excellent in photosensitivity to the light with wavelengths of all the regions from relatively shorter wavelength to relatively longer wavelength, including visible light region. Also, when the distribution state of germanium atoms in the first layer G is ununiform in the layer thickness direction, the germanium atoms are distributed continuously throughout the whole layer region while giving a change in distribution concentration C of the germanium atoms in the layer thickness direction which is decreased from the substrate toward the second layer S , and therefore affinity between the first layer G and the second layer S is excellent. Also, as described as hereinafter, by extremely increasing the distribution concentration C of germanium atoms at the end portion on the substrate side extremely great, the light on the longer wavelength side which cannot substantially be absorbed by the second layer S can be absorbed in the first layer G substantially completely, when employing a semiconductor laser, whereby interference by reflection from the substrate surface can be prevented. Also, in the light receiving member of the present invention, the respective amorphous materials constituting the first layer G and the second layer S have the common constituent of silicon atoms, and therefore chemical stability can sufficiently be ensured at the laminated interface. Figs. 11 through 19 show typical examples of distribution in the layer thickness direction of germanium atoms contained in the first layer region G of the light receiving member in the present invention. In Figs. 11 through 19, the abscissa indicates the content C of germanium atoms and the ordinate the layer thickness of the first layer G , t In Fig. 11, there is shown a first typical embodiment of the depth profile of germanium atoms in the layer thickness direction contained in the first layer G . In the embodiment as shown in Fig. 11, from the interface position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 12, the distribution concentration C of germanium atoms contained is decreased gradually and continuously from the position t In case of Fig. 13, the distribution concentration C of germanium atoms is made constant as C₆ at the position t In case of Fig. 14, germanium atoms are decreased gradually and continuously from the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 15, the distribution concentration C cf germanium atoms is constantly C₉ between the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 16, there is formed a depth profile such that the distribution concentration C takes a constant value of C₁₁ from the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 17, the distribution concentration C of germanium atoms is decreased as a first order function from the concentration C₁₄ to zero from the position t In Fig. 18, there is shown an embodiment, where the distribution concentration C of germanium atoms is decreased as a first order function from the concentration C₁₅ to C₁₆ from the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 19, the distribution concentration C of germanium atoms is at the concentration C₁₇ at the position t Between the position t₆ and the position t₇, the concentration is initially decreased abruptly and thereafter gradually, until it is made the concentration C₁₉ at the position t₇. Between the position t₇ and the position t₈, the concentration is decreased very gradually to the concentration C₂₀ at the position t₈. Between the position t₈ and the position t As described above about some typical examples of depth profiles of germanium atoms contained in the first layer G in the direction of the layer thickness by referring to Figs. 11 through 19, when the distribution state of germanium atoms is ununiform in the layer thickness direction, the first layer G is provided desirably in a depth profile so as to have a portion enriched in distribution concentration C of germanium atoms on the substrate side and a portion depleted in distribution concentration C of germanium atoms considerably lower than that of the substrate side on the interface t The first layer G constituting the light receiving member in the present invention is desired to have a localized region A containing germanium atoms at a relatively higher concentration on the substrate side as described above. In the present invention, the localized region A , as explained in terms of the symbols shown in Fig. 11 through Fig. 19, may be desirably provided within 5 µ from the interface position t In the present invention, the above localized region A may be made to be identical with the whole of the layer region L It may suitably be determined depending on the characteristics required for the light receiving layer to be formed, whether the localized region A is made a part or whole of the layer region L The localized region A may preferably be formed according to such a layer formation that the maximum value Cmax of the concentrations of germanium atoms in a distribution in the layer thickness direction may preferably be 1000 atomic ppm or more, more preferably 5000 atomic ppm or more, most preferably 1x10⁴ atomic ppm or more based on silicon atoms. That is, according to the present invention, it is desirable that the layer region G containing germanium atoms is formed so that the maximum value Cmax of the distribution concentration C may exist within a layer thickness of 5 µ from the substrate side the layer region within 5 µ thickness from t In the present invention, the content of germanium atoms in the first layer G , which may suitably be determined as desired so as to acheive effectively the objects of the present invention, may preferably be 1 to 9.5 x 10⁵ atomic ppm, more preferably 100 to 8 x 10⁵ atomic ppm, most preferably 500 to 7 x 10⁵ atomic ppm. In the present invention, the layer thickness of the first layer G and the thickness of the second layer S are one of the important factors for accomplishing effectively the objects of the present invention, and therefore sufficient care should desirably be paid in designing of the light receiving member so that desirable characteristics may be imparted to the light receiving member formed. In the present invention, the layer thickness T On the other hand, the layer thickness T of the second layer S may be preferably 0.5 to 90 µ, more preferably 1 to 80 µ, most preferably 2 to 50 µ. The sum of the above layer thicknesses T and T In the light receiving member of the present invention, the numerical range for the above T In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferred to select the numerical values for respective thicknesses T In selection of the numerical values for the thicknesses T In the present invention, when the content of germanium atoms in the first layer G is 1 x 10⁵ atomic ppm or more, the layer thickness T In the present invention, illustrative of halogen atoms X , which may optionally be incorporated in the first layer G and the second layer S constituting the light receiving layer, are fluorine, chlorine, bormine and iodine, particularly preferably fluorine and chlorine. In the present invention, formation of the first layer G constituted of A SiGe H,X may be conducted according to the vacuum deposition method utilizing discharging phenomenon, such as glow discharge method, sputtering method or ion plating method. For example, for formation of the first layer G constituted of A SiGe H,X according to the glow discharge method, the basic procedure comprises introducing a starting gas for Si supply capable of supplying silicon atoms Si , a starting gas for Ge supply capable of supplying germanium atoms Ge optionally together with a starting gas for introduction of hydrogen atoms H and or a starting gas for introduction of halogen atoms X into a deposition chamber which can be internally brought to a reduced pressure, and exciting glow discharge in said deposition chamber, thereby effecting layer formation on the surface of a substrate placed at a predetermined position while controlling the depth profile of germanium atoms according to a desired rate of change curve to form a layer constituent of A SiGe H,X . Alternatively, for formation according to the sputtering method, when carrying out sputtering by use of two sheets of targets of a target constituted of Si and a target constituted of Ge, or a target of a mixture of Si and Ge in an atmosphere of an inert gas such as Ar, He, etc. or a gas mixture based on these gases, a gas for introduction of hydrogen atoms H and or a gas for introduction of halogen atoms X may be introduced, if desired, into a deposition chamber for sputtering. The starting gas for supplying Si to be used in the present invention may include gaseous or gasifiable hydrogenated silicons silanes such as SiH₄, Si₂H₆, Si₃H₈, Si₄H₁₀ and others as effective materials. In particular, SiH₄ and Si₂H₆ are preferred because of easiness in handling during layer formation and high efficiency for supplying Si. As the substances which can be used as the starting gases for Ge supply, there may be effectively employed gaseous or gasifiable hydrogenated germanium such as GeH₄, Ge₂H₆, Ge₃H₈, Ge₄H₁₀, Ge₅H₁₂, Ge₆H₁₄, Ge₇H₁₆, Ge₈H₁₈, Ge₉H₂₀, etc. In particular, GeH₄, Ge₂H₆ and Ge₃H₈ are preferred because of easiness in handling during layer formation and high efficiency for supplying Ge. Effective starting gases for introduction of halogen atoms to be used in the present invention may include a large number of halogenic compounds, as exemplified preferably by halogenic gases, halides, interhalogen compounds, or gaseous or gasifiable halogenic compounds such as silane derivatives substituted with halogens. Further, there may also be included gaseous or gasifiable hydrogenated silicon compounds containing halogen atoms constituted of silicon atoms and halogen atoms as constituent elements as effective ones in the present invention. Typical examples of halogen compounds preferably used in the present invention may include halogen gases such as of fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, interhalogen compounds such as BrF, ClF, ClF₃, BrF₅, BrF₃, IF₃, IF₇, ICl, IBr, etc. As the silicon compounds containing halogen atoms, namely so called silane derivatives substituted with halogens, there may preferably be employed silicon halides such as SiF₄, Si₂F₆, SiCl₄, SiBr₄ and the like. When the light receiving member of the present invention is formed according to the glow discharge method by employment of such a silicon compound containing halogen atoms, it is possible to form the first layer G constituted of A SiGe containing halogen atoms on a desired substrate without use of a hydrogenated silicon gas as the starting gas capable of supplying Si together with the starting gas for Ge supply. In the case of forming the first layer G containing halogen atoms according to the glow discharge method, the basic procedure comprises introducing, for example, a silicon halide as the starting gas for Si supply, a hydrogenated germanium as the starting gas for Ge supply and a gas such as Ar, H₂, He, etc. at a predetermined mixing ratio into the deposition chamber for formation of the first layer G and exciting glow discharge to form a plasma atmosphere of these gases, whereby the first layer G can be formed on a desired substrate. In order to control the ratio of hydrogen atoms incorporated more easily, hydrogen gas or a gas of a silicon compound containing hydrogen atoms may also be mixed with these gases in a desired amount to form the layer. Also, each gas is not restricted to a single species, but multiple species may be available at any desired ratio. For formation of the first layer G comprising A SiGe H,X according to the reactive sputtering method or the ion plating method, for example, in the case of the sputtering method, two sheets of a target of Si and a target of Ge or a target of Si and Ge is employed and subjected to sputtering in a desired gas plasma atmosphere. In the case of the ion plating method, for example, a vaporizing source such as a polycrystalline silicon or a single crystalline silicon and a polycrystalline germanium or a single crystalline germanium may be placed as vaporizing source in an evaporating boat, and the vaporizing source heated by the resistance heating method or the electron beam method EB method to be vaporized, and the flying vaporized product is permitted to pass through a desired gas plasma atmosphere. In either case of the sputtering method and the ion plating method, introduction of halogen atoms into the layer formed may be performed by introducing the gas of the above halogen compound or the above silicon compound containing halogen atoms into a deposition chamber and forming a plasma atmosphere of said gas. On the other hand, for introduction of hydrogen atoms, a starting gas for introduction of hydrogen atoms, for example, H₂ or gases such as silanes and or hydrogenated germanium as mentioned above, may be introduced into a deposition chamber for sputtering, followed by formation of the plasma atmosphere of said gases. In the present invention, as the starting gas for introduction of halogen atoms, the halides or halo containing silicon compounds as mentioned above can effectively be used. Otherwise, it is also possible to use effectively as the starting material for formation of the first layer G gaseous or gasifiable substances, including halides containing hydrogen atom as one of the constituents, e.g. hydrogen halide such as HF, HCl, HBr, HI, etc. halo substituted hydrogenated silicon such as SiH₂F₂, siH₂I₂, SiH₂Cl₂, SiHCl₃, SiH₂Br₂, SiHBr₃, etc. hydrogenated germanium halides such as GeHF₃, GeH₂F₂, GeH₃F, GeHCl₃, GeH₂Cl₂, GeH₃Cl, GeHBr₃, GeH₂Br₂, GeH₃Br, GeHI₃, GeH₂I₂, GeH₃I, etc. germanium halides such as GeF₄, GeCl₄, GeBr₄, GeI₄, GeF₂, GeCl₂, GeBr₂, GeI₂, etc. Among these substances, halides containing halogen atoms can preferably be used as the starting material for introduction of halogens, because hydrogen atoms, which are very effective for controlling electrical or photoelectric characteristics, can be introduced into the layer simultaneously with introduction of halogen atoms during formation of the first layer G . For introducing hydrogen atoms structurally into the first layer G , other than those as mentioned above, H₂ or a hydrogenated silicon such as SiH₄, Si₂H₆, Si₃H₃, Si₄H₁₀, etc. together with germanium or a germanium compound for supplying Ge, or a hydrogenated germanium such as GeH₄, Ge₂H₆, Ge₃H₈, Ge₄H₁₀, Ge₅H₁₂, Ge₆H₁₄, Ge₇H₁₆, Ge₈H₁₈, Ge₉H₂₀, etc. together with silicon or a silicon compound for supplying Si can be permitted to co exist in a deposition chamber, followed by excitation of discharging. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the amount of hydrogen atoms H or the amount of halogen atoms X or the sum of the amounts of hydrogen atoms and halogen atoms H X to be contained in the first layer G constituting the light receiving layer to be formed should preferably be 0.01 to 40 atomic , more preferably 0.05 to 30 atomic , most preferably 0.1 to 25 atomic . For controlling the amount of hydrogen atoms H and or halogen atoms X to be contained in the first layer G , for example, the substrate temperature and or the amount of the starting materials used for incorporation of hydrogen atoms H or halogen atoms X to be introduced into the deposition device system, discharging power, etc. may be controlled. In the present invention, for formation of the second layer S constituted of A Si H,X , the starting materials I for formation of the first layer G , from which the starting materials for the starting gas for supplying Ge are omitted, are used as the starting materials II for formation of the second layer S , and layer formation can be effected following the same procedure and conditions as in formation of the first layer G . More specifically, in the present invention, formation of the second layer region S constituted of a Si H,X may be carried out according to the vacuum deposition method utilizing discharging phenomenon such as the glow discharge method, the sputtering method or the ion plating method. For example, for formation of the second layer S constituted of A Si H,X according to the glow discharge method, the basic procedure comprises introducing a starting gas for Si supply capable of supplying silicon atoms Si as described above, optionally together with starting gases for introduction of hydrogen atoms H and or halogen atoms X , into a deposition chamber which can be brought internally to a reduced pressure and exciting glow discharge in said deposition chamber, thereby forming a layer comprising A Si H,X on a desired substrate placed at a predetermined position. Alternatively, for formation according to the sputtering method, gases for introduction of hydrogen atoms H and or halogen atoms X may be introduced into a deposition chamber when effecting sputtering of a target constituted of Si in an inert gas such as Ar, He, etc. or a gas mixture based on these gases. In the present invention, the amount of hydrogen atoms H or the amount of halogen atoms X or the sum of the amounts of hydrogen atoms and halogen atoms H X to be contained in the second layer S constituting the light receiving layer to be formed should preferably be 1 to 40 atomic , more preferably 5 to 30 atomic , most preferably 5 to 25 atomic . In the light receiving member of the present invention, for the purpose of obtaining higher photosensitivity and dark resistance, and further for the purpose of improving adhesion between the substrate and the light receiving layer, at least one kind of atoms selected from oxygen atoms, carbon atoms and nitrogen atoms is contained in the light receiving layer in either uniform or ununiform distribution state in the layer thickness direction. Such atoms OCN to be contained in the light receiving layer may be contained therein throughout the whole layer region of the light receiving layer or localized by being contained in a part of the layer region of the light receiving layer. The distribution concentration C OCN of the atoms OCN should desirably be uniform within the plane parallel to the surface of the substrate. In the present invention, the layer region OCN where atoms OCN are contained is provided so as to occupy the whole layer region of the light receiving layer when it is primarily intended to improve photosensitivity and dark resistance, while it is provided so as to occupy the end portion layer region on the substrate side of the light receving layer when it is primarily intended to strengthen adhesion between the substrate and the light receiving layer. In the former case, the content of atoms OCN contained in the layer region OCN should desirably be made relatively smaller in order to maintain high photosensitivity, while in the latter case relatively larger in order to ensure reinforcement of adhesion to the substrate. In the present invention, the content of the atoms OCN to be contained in the layer region OCN provided in the light receiving layer can be selected suitably in organic relationship with the characteristics required for the layer region OCN itself, or with the characteristic at the contacted interface with the substrate when the said layer region OCN is provided in direct contact with the substrate, etc. When other layer regions are to be provided in direct contact with the layer region OCN , the content of the atoms OCN may suitably be selected with due considerations about the characteristics of said other layer regions or the characteristics at the contacted interface with said other layer regions. The amount of the atoms OCN contained in the layer region OCN may be determined as desired depending on the characteristics required for the light receiving member to be formed, but it may preferably be 0.001 to 50 atomic , more preferably 0.002 to 40 atomic , most preferably 0.003 to 30 atomic . In the present invention, when the layer region OCN occupies the whole region of the light receiving layer or, although not occupying the whole region, the proportion of the layer thickness T In the case of the present invention, when the proportion of the layer thickness T According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is desirable that the atoms OCN should be contained in at least the above first layer to be provided directly on the substrate. In short, by incorporating the atoms OCN at the end portion layer region on the substrate side in the light receiving layer, it is possible to effect reinforcement of adhesion between the substrate and the light receiving layer. Further, in the case of nitrogen atoms, for example, under the co presence with boron atoms, improvement of dark resistance and improvement of photosensitivity can further be ensured, and therefore they should preferably be contained in a desired amount in the light receiving layer. Plural kinds of these atoms OCN may also be contained in the light receiving layer. For example, oxygen atoms may be contained in the first layer, nitrogen atoms in the second layer, or alternatively oxygen atoms and nitrogen atoms may be permitted to be co present in the same layer region. Figs. 36 through 44 show typical examples of ununiform depth profiles in the layer thickness direction of the atoms OCN contained in the layer region OCN in the light receiving member of the present invention. In Figs. 36 through 44 the abscissa indicates the distribution concentration C of the atoms OCN , and the ordinate the layer thickness of the layer region OCN , t Fig. 36 shows a first typical embodiment of the depth profile in the layer thickness direction of the atoms OCN contained in the layer region OCN . In the embodiment shown in Fig. 36, from the interface position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 37, the distribution concentration C of the atoms OCN contained is reduced gradually continuously from the concentration C₄ from the position t In the case of Fig. 38, from the position t In the case of Fig. 39, the distribution concentration C of the atoms OCN is reduced gradually continuously from the concentration C₈ from the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 40, the distribution concentration C of the atoms OCN is made constantly C₉ between the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 41, from the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 42, from the position t In Fig. 43, there is shown an embodiment, wherein from the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 44, the distribution concentration C of the atoms OCN is C₁₇ at the position t Between the position t₆ and the position t₇, the concentration is initially reduced abruptly and thereafter gently gradually reduced to become C₁₉ at the position t₇, and between the position t₇ and the position t₈, it is reduced very gradually to become C₂₀ at the position t₈. Between the position t₈ and the position t As described above about some typical examples of depth profiles in the layer thickness direction of the atoms OCN contained in the layer region OCN by referring to Figs. 36 through 44, it is desirable in the present invention that, when the atoms OCN are to be contained ununiformly in the layer region OCN , the atoms OCN should be distributed in the layer region OCN with higher concentration on the substrate side, while having a portion considerably depleted in concentration on the interface t The layer region OCN containing atoms OCN should desirably be provided so as to have a localized region B containing the atoms OCN at a relatively higher concentration on the substrate side as described above, and in this case, adhesion between the substrate and the light receiving layer can be further improved. The above localized region B should desirably be provided within 5 µ from the interface position t In the present invention, the above localized region B may be made the whole of the layer region L It may suitably be determined depending on the characteristics required for the light receiving layer to be formed whether the localized region B is made a part or the whole of the layer region L The localized region B should preferably be formed to have a depth profile in the layer thickness direction such that the maximum value Cmax of the distribution concentration of the atoms OCN may preferably be 500 atomic ppm or more, more preferably 800 atomic ppm or more, most preferably 1000 atomic ppm or more. In other words, in the present invention, the layer region OCN containing the atoms OCN should preferably be formed so that the maximum value Cmax of the distribution concentration C may exist within 5 µ layer thickness from the substrate side in the layer region with 5 µ thickness from t In the present invention, when the layer region OCN is provided so as to occupy a part of the layer region of the light receiving layer, the depth profile of the atoms OCN should desirably be formed so that the refractive index may be changed moderately at the interface between the layer region OCN and other layer regions. By doing so, reflection of the light incident upon the light receiving layer from the interface between contacted interfaces can be inhibited, whereby appearance of interference fringe pattern can more effectively be prevented. It is also preferred that the distribution concentration C of the atoms OCN in the layer region OCN should be changed along a line which is changed continuously and moderately, in order to give smooth refractive index change. In this regard, it is preferred that the atoms OCN should be contained in the layer region OCN so that the depth profiles as shown, for example, in Figs. 36 through 39 Fig. 42 and Fig. 44 may be assumed. In the present invention, for provision of a layer region OCN containing the atoms OCN in the light receiving layer, a starting material for introduction of the atoms OCN may be used together with the starting material for formation of the light receiving layer during formation of the light receiving layer and incorporated in the layer formed while controlling its amount. When the glow discharge method is employed for formation of the layer region OCN , a starting material for introduction of the atoms OCN is added to the material selected as desired from the starting materials for formation of the light receiving layer as described above. For such a starting material for introduction of the atoms OCN , there may be employed most of gaseous or gasified gasifiable substances containing at least the atoms OCN as the constituent atoms. More specifically, there may be included, for example, oxygen O₂ , ozone O₃ , nitrogen monoxide NO , nitrogen dioxide NO₂ , dinitrogen monoxide N₂O , dinitrogen trioxide N₂O₃ , dinitrogen tetraoxide N₂O₄ , dinitrogen pentaoxide N₂O₅ , nitrogen trioxide NO₃ lower siloxanes containing silicon atom Si , oxygen atom O and hydrogen atom H as constituent atoms, such as disiloxane H₃SiOSiH₃ , trisiloxane H₃SiOSiH₂OSiH₃ , and the like saturated hydrocarbons having 1 5 carbon atoms such as methane CH₄ , ethane C₂H₆ , propane C₃H₈ , n butane n C₄H₁₀ , pentane C₅H₁₂ ethylenic hydrocarbons having 2 5 carbon atoms such as ethylene C₂H₄ , propylene C₃H₆ , butene 1 C₄H₈ , butene 2 C₄H₈ , isobutylene C₄H₈ , pentene C₅H₁₀ acetylenic hydrocarbons having 2 4 carbon atoms such as acetylene C₂H₂ , methyl acetyllene C₃H₄ , butyne C₄H₆ and the like nitrogen N₂ , ammonia NH₃ , hydrazine H₂NNH₂ , hydrogen azide HN₃ , ammonium azide NH₄N₃ , nitrogen trifluoride F₃N , nitrogen tetrafluoride F₄N and so on. In the case of the sputtering method, as the starting material for introduction of the atoms OCN , there may also be employed solid starting materials such as SiO₂, Si₃N₄ and carbon black in addition to those gasifiable as enumerated for the glow discharge method. These can be used in the form of a target for sputtering together with the target of Si, etc. In the present invention, when forming a layer region OCN containing the atoms OCN during formation of the light receiving layer, formation of the layer region OCN having a desired depth profile in the direction of layer thickness formed by varying the distribution concentration C of the atoms OCN contained in said layer region OCN may be conducted in the case of glow discharge by introducing a starting gas for introduction of the atoms OCN the distribution concentration C of which is to be varied into a deposition chamber, while varying suitably its gas flow rate according to a desired change rate curve. For example, by the manual method or any other method conventionally used such as an externally driven motor, etc., the opening of a certain needle valve provided in the course of the gas flow channel system may be gradually varied. During this operation, the rate of variationis not necessarily required to be linear, but the flow rate may be controlled according to a variation rate curve previously designed by means of, for example, a microcomputer to give a desired content curve. When the layer region OCN is formed according to the sputtering method, formation of a desired depth profile of the atoms OCN in the layer thickness direction by varying the distribution concentration C of the atoms OCN may be performed first similarly as in the case of the glow discharge method by employing a starting material for introduction of the atoms OCN under gaseous state and varying suitably as desired the gas flow rate of said gas when introduced into the deposition chamber. Secondly, formation of such a depth profile can also be achieved by previously changing the composition of a target for sputtering. For example, when a target comprising a mixture of Si and SiO₂ is to be used, the mixing ratio of Si to SiO₂ may be varied in the direction of layer thickness of the target. In the light receiving member 1004, by incorporating a substance C for controlling conductivity in at least the first layer G 1002 and or the second layer S 1003, desired conductivity characteristics can be given to the layer containing said substance C . In this case, the substance C for controlling conductivity may be contained throughout the whole layer region in the layer containing the substance C or contained locally in a part of the layer region of the layer containing the substance C . Also, in the layer region PN containing said substance C , the distribution state of said substance C in the layer thickness direction may be either uniform or nonuniform, but desirably be made uniform within the plane in parallel to the substrate surface. When the distribution state of the substance C is nonuniform in the layer thickness direction, and when the substance C is to be incorporated in the whole layer region of the first layer G , said substance C is contained in the first layer G so that it may be more enriched on the substrate side of the first layer G . Thus, in the layer region PN , when the distribution concentration in the layer thickness direction of the above substance C is made nonuniform, optical and electrical junction at the contacted interface with other layers can further be improved. In the present invention, when the substance C for controlling conductivity is incorporated in the first layer G so as to be locally present in a part of the layer region, the layer region PN in which the substance C is to be contained is provided as an end portion layer region of the first layer G , which is to be determined case by case suitably as desired depending on. In the present invention, when the above substance C is to be incorporated in the second layer S , it is desirable to incorporate the substance C in the layer region including at least the contacted interface with the first layer G . When the substance C for controlling conductivity is to be incorporated in both the first layer G and the second layer S , it is desirable that the layer region containing the substance C in the first layer G and the layer region containing the substance C in the second layer S may contact each other. Also, the above substance C contained in the first layer G may be either the same as or different from that contained in the second layer S , and their contents may be either the same or different. However, in the present invention, when the above substance C is of the same kind in the both layers, it is preferred to make the content in the first layer G sufficiently greater, or alternatively to incorporate substances C with different electrical characteristics in respective layers desired. In the present invention, by incorporating a substance C for controlling conductivity in at least the first layer G and or the second layer S constituting the light receiving layer, conductivity of the layer region containing the substance C which may be either a part or the whole of the layer region of the first layer G and or the second layer S can be controlled as desired. As a substance C for controlling conductivity characteristics, there may be mentioned so called impurities in the field of semiconductors. In the present invention, there may be included p type impurities giving p type condutivity characteristics and n type impurities and or giving n type conductivity characteristics to A Si H,X and or A SiGe H,X constituting the light receiving layer to be formed. More specifically, there may be mentioned as p type impurities atoms belonging to the group III of the periodic table Group III atoms , such as B boron , Al aluminum , Ga gallium , In indium , Tl thallium , etc., particularly preferably B and Ga. As n type impurities, there may be included the atoms belonging to the group V of the periodic table, such as P phosphorus , As arsenic , Sb antimony , Bi bismuth , etc., particularly preferably P and As. In the present invention, the content of the substance C for controlling conductivity in the layer region PN may be suitably be determined depending on the conductivity required for said layer region PN , or when said layer region PN is provided in direct contact with the substrate, the organic relationships such as relation with the characteristics at the contacted interface with the substrate, etc. Also, the content of the substance C for controlling conductivity is determined suitably with due considerations of the relationships with characteristics of other layer regions provided in direct contact with said layer region or the characteristics at the contacted interface with said other layer regions. In the present invention, the content of the substance C for controlling conductivity contained in the layer region PN should preferably be 0.01 to 5 x 10⁴ atomic ppm, more preferably 0.5 to 1 x 10⁴ atomic ppm, most preferably 1 to 5 x 10³ atomic ppm. In the present invention, by making the content of said substance C in the layer region PN preferably 30 atomic ppm or more, more preferably 50 atomic ppm or more, most preferably 100 atomic ppm or more, for example, in the case when said substance C to be incorporated is a p type impurity as mentioned above, migration of electrons injected from the substrate side into the light receiving layer can be effectively inhibited when the free surface of the light receiving layer is subjected to the charging treatment to polarity. On the other hand, when the substance to be incorporated is a n type impurity, migration of positive holes injected from the substrate side into the light receiving layer may be effectively inhibited when the free surface of the light receiving layer is subjected to the charging treatment to polarity. In the case as mentioned above, the layer region Z at the portion excluding the above layer region PN under the basic constitution of the present invention as described above may contain a substance for controlling conductivity of the other polarity, or a substance for controlling conductivity having characteristics of the same polarity may be contained therein in an amount by far smaller than that practically contained in the layer region PN . In such a case, the content of the substance C for controlling conductivity contained in the above layer region Z can be determined adequately as desired depending on the polarity or the content of the substance contained in the layer region PN , but it is preferably 0.001 to 1000 atomic ppm, more preferably 0.05 to 500 atomic ppm, most preferably 0.1 to 200 atomic ppm. In the present invention, when the same kind of a substance for controlling conductivity is contained in the layer region PN and the layer region Z , the content in the layer region Z should preferably be 30 atomic ppm or less. In the present invention, it is also possible to provide a layer region containing a substance for controlling conductivity having one polarity and a layer region containing a substance for controlling conductivity having the other polarity in direct contact with each other, thus providing a so called depletion layer at said contact region. In short, for example, a layer containing the aforesaid p type impurity and a layer region containing the aforesaid n type impurity are provided in the light receiving layer in direct contact with each other to form the so called p n junction, whereby a depletion layer can be provided. Figs. 27 through 35 show typical examples of the depth profiles in the layer thickness direction of the substance C contained in the layer region PN in the light receiving layer of the present invention. In each of these Figures, representations of layer thickness and concentration are shown in rather exaggerated forms for illustrative purpose, since the difference between respective Figures will be indistinct if represented by the real values as such, and it should be understood that these Figures are schematic in nature. As practical distribution, the values of ti 1 i 9 or Ci 1 i 17 should be chosen so as to obtain desired distribution concentration lines, or values obtained by multiplying the distribution curve as a whole with an appropriate coefficient should be used. In Figs. 27 through 35, the abscissa shows the distribution concentration C of the substance C , and the ordinate the layer thickness of the layer region PN , t Fig. 27 shows a first typical example of the depth profile of the substance C in the layer thickness direction contained in the layer region PN . In the embodiment shown in Fig. 27, from the interface position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 28, the distribution concentration C of the substance C contained is decreased from the position t In the case of Fig. 29, from the position t In the case of Fig. 30, the distribution concentration C of the substance C is first decreased continuously and gradually from the concentration C₆ from the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 31, the distribution concentration of the substance C is constantly C₇ between the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 32, the distribution concentration C takes a constant value of C₈ from the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 33, from the position t In Fig. 34, there is shown an embodiment, in which, from the position t In the embodiment shown in Fig. 35 , the distribution concentration C of the substance C is C₁₄ at the position t Between the position t₇ and the position t₈, the concentration is initially abruptly decreased and then moderately gradually, until it becomes C₁₆ at the position t₈, and between the position t₈ and the position t₉, the concentration is gradually decreased to reach C₁₇ at the position t₉. Between the position t₉ and the position t As described above by referring to some typical examples of depth profiles in the layer thickness direction of the substance C contained in the layer region PN shown Figs. 27 through 35, it is desirable in the present invention that a depth profile of the substance C should be provided in the layer region PN so as to have a portion with relatively higher distribution concentration C of the substance C on the substrate side, while having a portion on the interface t The layer region PN constituting the light receiving member in the present invention is desired to have a localized region B containing the substance C preferably at a relatively higher concentration on the substrate side as described above. In the present invention, the localized region B as explained in terms of the symbols shown in Figs. 27 through 35, may be desirably provided within 5 µ from the interface position t In the present invention, the above localized region B may be made to be identical with the whole of the layer region L from the interface position t It may suitably be determined depending on the characteristics required for the light receiving layer to be formed whether the localized region B should be made a part or the whole of the layer region L . For formation of the layer region PN containing the aforesaid substance C by incorporating a substance C for controlling conductivity such as the group III atoms or the group V atoms structurally into the light receiving layer, a starting material for introduction of the group III atoms or a starting material for introduction of the group V atoms may be introduced under gaseous state into a deposition chamber together with other starting materials for formation of the respective layers during layer formation. As the starting material which can be used for introduction of the group III atoms, it is desirable to use those which are gaseous at room temperature under atmospheric pressure or can readily be gasified under layer forming conditions. Typical examples of such starting materials for introduction of the group III atoms, there may be included as the compounds for introduction of boron atoms boron hydrides such as B₂H₆, B₄H₁₀, B₅H₉, B₅H₁₁, B₆H₁₀, B₆H₁₂, B₆H₁₄, etc. and boron halides such as BF₃, BCl₃, BBr₃, etc. Otherwise, it is also possible to use AlCl₃, GaCl₃, Ga CH₃ ₃, InCl₃, TlCl₃ and the like. The starting materials which can effectively be used in the present invention for introduction of the group V atoms may include, for introduction of phosphorus atoms, phosphorus hydrides such as PH₃, P₂H₄, etc., phosphorus halides such as PH₄I, PF₃, PF₅, PCl₃, PCl₅, PBr₃, PBr₅, PI₃ and the like. Otherwise, it is possible to utilize AsH₃, AsF₃, AsCl₃, AsBr₃, AsF₅, SbH₃, SbF₃, SbF₅, SbCl₃, SbCl₅, SbCl, BiH₃, BiCl₃, BiBr₃ and the like effectively as the starting material for introduction of the group V atoms. The substrate to be used in the present invention may be either electroconductive or insulating. As the electroconductive substrate, there may be mentioned metals such as NiCr, stainless steel, Aℓ, Cr, Mo, Au, Nb, Ta, V, Ti, Pt, Pd etc. or alloys thereof. As insulating substrates, there may conventionally be used films or sheets of synthetic resins, including polyester, polyethylene, polycarbonate, cellulose acetate, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polystyrene, polyamide, etc., glasses, ceramics, papers and so on. At least one side surface of these substrates is preferably subjected to treatment for imparting electroconductivity, and it is desirable to provide other layers on the side at which said electroconductive treatment has been applied. For example, electroconductive treatment of a glass can be effected by providing a thin film of NiCr, Aℓ, Cr, Mo, Au, Ir, Nb, Ta, V, Ti, Pt, Pd, In₂O₃, SnO₂, ITO In₂O₃ SnO₂ thereon. Alternatively, a synthetic resin film such as polyester film can be subjected to the electroconductive treatment on its surface by vacuum vapor deposition, electron beam deposition or sputtering of a metal such as NiCr, Aℓ, Ag, Pb, Zn, Ni, Au, Cr, Mo, Ir, Nb, Ta, V, Ti, Pt, etc. or by laminating treatment with said metal, thereby imparting electroconductivity to the surface. The substrate may be shaped in any form such as cylinders, belts, plates or others, and its form may be determined as desired. For example, when the light receiving member 1004 in Fig. 10 is to be used as the light receiving member for electrophotography, it may desirably be formed into an endless belt or a cylinder for use in continuous high speed copying. The substrate may have a thickness, which is conveniently determined so that the light receiving member as desired may be formed. When the light receiving member is required to have a flexibility, the substrate is made as thin as possible, so far as the function of a support can be exhibited. However, in such a case, the thickness is generally 10 µ or more from the points of fabrication and handling of the substrate as well as its mechanical strength. Fig. 26 is a schematic illustration of an example of the image forming device employing electrophotographic technique in which the light receiving member of the present invention is mounted. In this Figure, 2601 is a drum shaped light receiving member of the present invention prepared for use in electrophotography, 2602 is a semiconductor laser device which is the light source for apply exposure on the light receiving member 2601 corresponding to the information to be recorded, 2603 is a fϑ lens, 2604 is a polygon mirror, 2605 shows the plane view of the device and 2606 shows the side view of the device. In Fig. 26, devices to be generally employed for practicing electrophotographic image formation, such as developing device, transfer device, fixing device, cleaning device, etc., are not shown. Next, an example of the process for producing the light receiving member of this invention is to be briefly described. Fig. 20 shows one example of a device for producing a light receiving member. In the gas bombs 2002 to 2006, there are hermetically contained starting gases for formation of the light receiving member of the present invention. For example, 2002 is a bomb containing SiH4 gas purity 99.999 , hereinafter abbreviated as SiH₄ , 2003 is a bomb containing GeH₄ gas purity 99.999 , hereinafter abbreviated as GeH₄ , 2004 is a bomb containing SiF₄ gas purity 99.99 , hereinafter abbreviated as SiF₄ , 2005 is bomb containing B₂H₆ gas diluted with H₂ purity 99.999 , hereinafter abbreviated as B₂H₆ H₂ and 2006 is a bomb containing H₂ gas purity 99.999 . For allowing these gases to flow into the reaction chamber 2001, on confirmation of the valves 2022 to 2026 of the gas bombs 2002 to 2006 and the leak valve 2035 to be closed, and the inflow valves 2012 to 2016, the outflow valves 2017 to 2021 and the auxiliary valves 2032 and 2033 to be opened, the main valve 2034 is first opened to evacuate the reaction chamber 2001 and the gas pipelines. As the next step, when the reading on the vacuum indicator 2036 becomes above 5 x 10 ⁶ Torr, the auxiliary valves 2032, 2033 and the outflow valves 2017 to 2021 are closed. Referring now to an example of forming a light receiving layer on the cylindirical substrate 2037, SiH₄ gas from the gas bomb 2002, GeH₄ gas from the gas bomb 2003, B₂H₆ H₂ gas from the gas bomb 2005 and H₂ gas from the gas bomb 2006 are permitted to flow into the mass flow controllers 2007, 2008 2010 and 2011, respectively by opening the valves 2022, 2023, 2025 and 2026 and controlling the pressures at the output pressure gauges 2027, 2028, 2030 and 2031 to 1 Kg cm² and opening gradually the inflow valves, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Subsequently, the outflow valves 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021 and the auxiliary valves 2032 and 2033 were gradually opened to permit respective gases to flow into the reaction chamber 2001. The outflow valves 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021 are controlled so that the flow rate ratio of SiH₄ gas, GeH₄ gas, B₂H₆ H₂ gas, and H₂ gas may have a desired value and opening of the main valve 2034 is also controlled while watching the reading on the vacuum indicator 2036 so that the pressure in the reaction chamber 2001 may reach a desired value. And, after confirming that the temperature of the substrate 2037 is set at 50 to 400 C by the heater 2038, the power source 2040 is set at a desired power to excite glow discharge in the reaction chamber 2001, simultaneously with controlling of the distribution concentrations of germanium atoms and boron atoms to be contained in the layer formed by carrying out the operation to change gradually the openings of the valves 2018, 2020 by the manual method or by means of an externally driven motor, etc. thereby changing the flow rates of GeH₄ gas and B₂H₆ gas according to previously designed change rate curves. By maintaining the glow discharge as described above for a desired period time, the first layer G is formed on the substrate 2037 to a desired thickness. At the stage when the first layer G is formed to a desired thickness, the second layer S containing substantially no germanium atom can be formed on the first layer G by maintaining glow discharge according to the same conditions and procedure as those in formation of the first layer G except for closing completely the outflow valve 2018 and changing, if desired, the discharging conditions. Also, in the respective layers of the first layer G and the second layer S , by opening or closing as desired the outflow valve 2020, boron atoms may be contained or not, or boron atoms may be contained only in a part of the layer region of the respective layers. On the light receiving member whose layers up to the above second layer S have been formed, the surface layer is formed according to the sputtering method. In the device shown in Fig. 20, a material for the surface layer is placed all over the cathode electrode and H₂ gas is replaced with Ar gas. Next, the light receiving member whose layers up to the second layer S have been formed is set in the devide, followed by sufficient evacuation of the device, and then Ar gas is introduced to a predetermined inner pressure. And, by introduction of a predetermined high frequency power, the material on the cathode electrode is sputtered to form the surface layer on the second layer S . During layer formation, it is desirable to rotate the substrate 2037 by a motor 2039 in order to effect uniformization of layer formation.

Thus, on a cylindrical aluminum substrate length L 357 mm, outerdiameter r 80 mm a spiral groove with a pitch P of 25 µm and a depth D of 0.8S was prepared. Next, under the conditions as shown in Table 1A, by use of the film deposition device as shown in Fig. 20, an a Si type light receiving member for electrography having a surface laminated thereon was prepared following predetermined operational procedures. NO gas was introduced, while controlling the flow rate by setting the mass flow controller so that its initial value may be 3.4 vol based on the sum of SiH₄ gas flow rate and GeH₄ gas flow rate. The surface layer was formed by placing a target of various materials thickness 3 mm ZrO₂ in this Example as shown in Table 30A on the entire surface of the cathode electrode in the film deposition device as shown in Fig. 20, and after H₂ gas employed during formation of the first layer and the second layer was replaced with Ar gas, evacuating the device to about 5 x 10 ⁶ torr, then introducing Ar gas thereinto and exciting glow discharging at a high frequency power of 300 W to effect sputtering of the ZrO₂ target on the cathode electrode. In the following Examples, except for changing the material for formation of the surface layer, formation of the surface layer was carried out as in this Example.
