# Cooling apparatus for viscous liquids.

## Abstract
A passage 13 to supply coolant and impellers 4 hav ing scraper vanes 7 extending toward the surface of said passage 13 are arranged in proximal relation to each other in a space for housing the liquid to be cooled. At least one of the coolant passage 13 and the impeller 4 is made mo vable in relation to the other. By the relative movement of the passage 13 and the impeller 4, the motion of forcibly removing the cooled liquid from a heat exchange portion of the passage surface and the motion of supplying the high temperature liquid to the said heat exchange portion are repeated.
