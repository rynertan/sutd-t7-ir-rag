# Settling of liquid dispersions.

## Abstract
Apparatus for aiding the separation of the components of a liquid dispersion comprises at least one pair of electrodes, arranged so as to be able to apply a unidirection al, varying electric field across at least a portion of a flow path 5a of the dispersion, at least one of the or each pair of electrodes being separated from the dispersion by a layer of electrically insulating material. A method for aiding the separation of the components of a liquid dispersion is also described.
