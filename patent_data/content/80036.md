# NONCIRCULAR REJECTS OUTLET FOR CYCLONE SEPARATOR

## Abstract
The use of rejects outlets 16, 17 in vortex separators having internal walls which gradually transform a circular cross section into openings which are noncircular in cross section has been found to be effective in controlling the rejects rate and the thickening factor of the separators while maintaining effective cleaning efficiencies without plugging problems. The rejects outlets 16, 17 may be fabricated as replaceable tips or may be integraliy formed with the cy clone bodies.
