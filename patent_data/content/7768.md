# HYDROFORMYLATION OF ALPHA OLEFINIC COMPOUNDS

## Abstract
A hydroformylation process is disclosed utilising a rhodium complex catalyst and an excess of a triorganophosphine wherein active rhodium catalyst and triorganophosphine can be separated from inactive rhodium, heavies and triorganosphosphine oxide in partially deactivated reaction medium by extraction into concentrated phosphoric acid or aqueous solutions containing at least 40 by weight phosphoric acid. By neutralisation of the phosphoric acid extract in the presence of organic solvent, e.g. aldehyde trimers, a solution of active rhodium catalyst and triorganophosphine can be produced that is suitable for re use in the hydroformylation reaction.
