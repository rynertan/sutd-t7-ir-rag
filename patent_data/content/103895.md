As endoparasites of animals, various parasites have been known, examples of which are Taeniidae Cestoda in dog, cat, goat, horse and chicken Ascaris in horse, pig, dog, cat and chicken Oxyuris equi Rhabditoidea in horse, pig, sheep and goat Trichuris in pig, sheep and dog Strongylus in horse Oesophagostomum in cattle, pig, sheep and goat Ancylostoma in cattle, sheep and dog stomach worm in cattle, horse, sheep and goat Ciliophora and cecum worm in chicken, turkey and duck Filaria in cattle, horse, sheep, goat and dog Fasciola hepatica parasitic in liver of cattle, horse, sheep, goat, pig, dog and cat and Tramatode such as Echinostoma parasitic in digestive organ system.Because of infections caused by these parasites, the infected animals suffer from anemia, dystrophy, infirmity, reduction in body weight, and damage in stomach or colon tube walls and other tissues or organs. Thus, such infection is one of the causes of lowering of feed efficiency and lowering of productivity, thereby giving rise to a great economical loss. 2 Anthelmintic of the present invention The compounds of the formula A have very high anthelmintic activities against a wide scope of various parasites as enumerated above. So far as safety is concerned, all of the compounds of the formula A have very low toxicity. That is, no abnormality is observed when these compounds are administered in a dose of, for example, 700 mg to 1,100 mg Kg for mouse, 700 to 1,000 mg Kg for rat and 1,500 mg Kg for chicken. Thus, these compounds are highly safe. These values differ somewhat depending on the kind of the compound employed. Examples of the animals for which the compounds represented by the formula A are practically applicable are domestic animals such as pig, sheep, horse, cattle, goat, dog and cat and poultry such as chicken, turkey and duck. Furthermore, these compounds can be administered at any stage of growth of such animals, that is, when they are young, during growth, or after they are fully grown. The dosage of the compounds of the formula A to be administered depends on the compound actually employed and the body weight of the animal to which the compound is administered, but, in general, a dese of ever 0,1 mg Kg per day, preferably between 1 mg kg and 100 mg Kg, is administered in order to achieve effective resuits. In the administration of the compounds of the formu I , they can be administered directly without addition of other components, or alternatively they can be administered as mixtures with physiologically nontoxic solid carriers or liquid carriers. Further, it is also possible to administer the compounds of the formula I by adding them directly into the feed or drinking water for the animals, or by adding the above mixtures with suitable carriers directly to the animals or into their feed or drinking water.The solid carriers employed in this case are, for example, orally digestable vessels such as gelatin capsules, or crude wheat powder, corn starch, defatted rice bran, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, talc, kaolin, white earth, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, stearic acid, agar, pectin and analogues thereof and also may be any of various excipients conventionally used in pharmaceuticals. As liquid vehicles, for example, nontoxic liquids such as water, isotonic sodium chloride solution, paraffins e.g., petroleum distillates , vegetable oils e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil or sesame oil , alcohols, e.g., ethyl alcohol or glycerol , and glycols e.g., propylene glycol or polyethylene alcohol can be employed. Other auxiliary agents or additives such as emulsifiers, dispersants, suspending aids, humectants, etc. can also be used, depending on the necessity. In practicing destruction of parasites by adding a compound of the formula A , it is compounded in a feed or drinking water in a proportion of more than 1 ppm preferably 10 ppm to 500 ppm, before being administered to an animal. On the other hand, when the compound of I is to be administered without addition to a feed or drinking water , it is possible to use various forms of preparations. In the case of administration by the use of solid carriers, it is possible to administer the compound in a form such as a tablet, capsule, pellet, giant pill, or powder. Alternatively, it can be administered by using a liquid carrier in the form of a soft gelatin capsule or a suspension. Further, when the compound df the formula A is dissolved or dispersed in a liquid carrier, it can be administered parenterally to an animal by injecting subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously or intraperitoneally. In the case of parenteral administration, the compound of the present invention can be administered according to an aqueous recipe by the use of a vegetable oil such as peanut oil or soybean oil, or alternatively an aqueous parenteral recipe by the use of a watersoluble vehicle such as glycerol or polyethylene glycol can also be used. These recipes generally contain the compound of the formula A in an amount of 0.1 to 30 by weight.

By varying the shapes of the mortar and the pestle of the tabletting machine, giant pills can be produced according to the same procedure as described above.Preparation Example E2 Liquid preparation A liquid preparation was prepared by mixing under stirring SO g of Compound No. E3, 49 g of ethanol and 1 g of polyvinyl alcohol. This liquid preparation was mixed with stirring into the drinking water for the animal to a concentration of 1 to be suspended in the drinking water, and the resultant suspension was administered to the subject animal.Preparation Example E3 Feed mixture A solution of 20 g of Compound No. E7 in 20 ml of ethanol was further added to 80 g of defatted rice bran and mixed therewith with stirring, and thereafter ethanol was evaporated off under reduced pressure to be completely removed. The mixture was mixed into feed for the animal in an amount of 50 g to 1,250 g per ton of the feed depending on the quantity of infecting parasites in the animal. In this case, the proportion of the present compound in the feed was 0.001 to 0.025 by weight.Preparation Example E4 Capsule Compound No. E5 20 g and 78 g of calcium carbonate were milled and mixed well in a ball mill. 2 g of magnesium stearate was further added thereto, and the mixture was further milled and mixed. The powder of this mixture was sub divided, and each sub division in an amount of 0.5 g was placed in a hard gelatin capsule.In each capsule was contained 100 mg of the present compound. One to 10 capsules per 10 Kg of body wei ght were administered to each animal depending on the body weight of the animal. In this case, the dose of administration of the present compound to the animal was 10 mg to 100 mg per Kg of body weight.Preparation Example E5 preparation for injection To 20 g of Compound No. E6 were added 1 g of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.2 g of sodium citrate and distilled water for injection to make up a total quantity of 100 ml, and the mixture was thoroughly mixed with stirring, to prepare a suspension for injection. These preparations for injection were injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally or intravaneously in amounts varied from 0.01 ml to 50 ml per day depending on the body weight of the animal. 3 Anthelmintic effect ETest Example El 1 Experimental method Chickens infected with fowl roundworm As. galli were employed in groups each consisting of five chickens. The compound provided for testing was orally administered in a quantity of 40 mg per Kg of body weight to each chicken in a gelatin capsule. The number of worm bodies discharged within 24 hours after administration of the medicine was counted. Then the chicken was killed, and the number of worm bodies remaining in the enteron was counted to determine the anthelmintic percentage, wherefrom the anthelmintic effect was judged. 2 Experimental results As shown in Table E2, marked anthelmintic effect was observed in every compound of N,O dipropargyl Nacylhydroxylamine derivatives of the present invention.
