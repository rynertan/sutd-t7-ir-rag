## Description
BENZENE SULPHONATE QUATERNARY AMMONIUM SALTSOF ORGANIC SUNSCREEN CARBOXYLIC ACIDS It has become increasingly apparent that UV light in addition to having detrimental effects on skin can also adversely affect human hair. Excessive exposure of hair to UV light causes brittleness, and in the case of dyed hair, discolouration, and loss of colour fidelity. Organic sunscreens are generally unsuitable for application to human hair because of inadequate substantivity. Thus, they tend to rinse out of the hair and are accordingly ineffective. Prior art attempts to remedy these shortcomings have not proved effective, or improved substantivity.Prior Art US Patent 4,256,664 discloses halogen containing quats from amides of salicylic acids, but no tosylates. US Patent 4,061,730 discloses a tosylate quat of benzylidene camphor. US Patent 4,104,368 discloses cat ionic, anionic complexes formed by reacting an alkali metal salt of a sunscreen. FrenchPatent 2,504,530 uses alkyl halides in the quaternisation step.Summary of the Invention It has now been found that benzene sulphonate quaternary ammonium salt of organic sunscreen carboxylic acids, believed t be novel chemicals , have surprising substantivity f Qr XÃ…air , and thus substantially protect it frbm the undesirable effects of sunlight.Detailed Description of the Invention The quaternary salts of this invention correspond to the formula EMI1.1 wherein the RCO moiety is selected from the group consisting of p amino benzoic acid, p dimethyl amino benzoic acid p methoxy cinnamic acid, p methoxy benzal malonic acid, and cinnamal malonic acid R is an alkyl group having froml to 2 carbon atoms R is an alkyl group having from 10 to 20 carbon atoms R is selected from the group consisting of H and CH3 X is selected from the group consisting of 0 and NH and Y is an integer of O to 1 Particularly preferred are those compounds where the RCO moiety is p dimethyl amino benzoic acid, p methoxy cinnamic acid, p methoxy benzal malonic acid, or cinnamal malonic acid where the X is 0 where R is C16 C18 and RT n is CH3 and in the para position. To obtain the derivative containing the necessary tertiary nitrogen various conventional techniques can be employled e.g. transesterification of the methylester with a tert amino alcohol , reaction of an acid chloride with a tert amino alcohol using pyridine or triethylamine as solvent and catalyst esterifcation of nitro benzoic acid with tert amino alcohols or amines, followed by reduction, or reductive alkylation, etc., e.g. see US Patent No.4,102 398. Then the derivative is quaternised by reaction, with an ester of the sulphonic acid The reaction is carried out conveniently in an isopropanol or toluene solution, which is heated to 75 120 for about 3 to 6 hours. The compounds of this invention are formulated into otherwise conventional compositions adapted for application to human hair. Thus they can be applied in an effective amount in cosmetic carriers known to the trade e.g. shampoos, sprays, and other speciality products. Concentrations of about 1 to 6 wtG in the composition are conveniently employed. The compounds of this invention provide versatility in formulation since different compounds have different solubilities in water and organic solvents, and have peak absorptions at different pHs. This invention, product work up, and properties of the materials will be better understood by reference to the following examples Example 1 cetyl stearyl sulphonate quaternary of 2 dimethylamino ethyl p dimethylamino benzoate Char ge 224g 1 mole 2 dimethylamino ethyl p di methyl amino benzoate 422g 1 combining wt cetyl stearyl toluene sulphonate 600g toluene The above materials were heated under reflux for 6 hours. At the end of this period, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and the solid filtered off. After recrystallisation twice from acetone toluene can also be used the solids were as charged.A yield of 565 grams 84.8 of theory was obtained having a m.p. of 153 157 C and an alkali number of 0.13. Using the same procedure, the following compounds were prepared Example 2 lauryl p toluene sulphonate quaternary of 2 dimethyl amino ethyl p dimethyl amino benzoate Off white solid was obtained in 87 yield alkali 2.6 and amp. of 133 137 C. Example 3 cetyl stearyl p toluene sulphonate quaternary of 2 dimethyl amino ethyl p methoxy cinnamate Compound obtained in 80 yield melting point 139 144 C and an alkali number of 0.0. Example 4 cetyl stearyl p toluene sulphonate quaternary of 2 dimethyl amino ethyl p dimethyl amino benzoate Obtained in an 88 yield, melting point 106 147 C, and alkali number of 1.6.Example 5 di cetyl stearyl p toluene sulphonate quaternary of di 2 dimethyl amino ethyl p methoxy benzal malonate A yield of 89 was obtained, the compound had an alkali number of 3.5, and was a very viscous liquid.Example 6 In order to demonstrate the substantivity and effectiveness of these compounds in prevention of the fading of dyed human hair, the following test programs were carried out on the compounds of Examples 3 5. The test samples were prepared by taking 1 gram of dyed human hair in a 3 solution or dispersion of each of the test compounds. After standing for 1 hour the hair was removed from the solution, one half was air dried, and the other half was rinsed for 5 minutes in tap water and then dried. All the test samples were irradiated with aHanovia Ultra Violet Lamp containing a Corex D filter.The control was 2 ethylhexyl p dimethylaminobenzoate.It was found that at 45 hours, fading in the control occurred with no fading of the treated sample. The rinsed samples also retained 1 2 to 3 4 of their fade resistance. Other materials of this invention work similarly. This work clearly demonstrates that these compounds are very good U.V. absorbers and that they have good substantivity for human hair, enough to prevent fading, superior to an ordinary comparable sunscreen. Additional compounds for similar utility can be prepared utilising other organic sunscreens containing a carboxylic group. The advantages of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Improved highly effective novel materials are provided having substantivity for hair which also impart protection against harmful sunlight. It will be understood that this invention is not limited to the specific examples which have been offered as particular embodiments, and that modifications can be made without departing from the spirit thereof.
