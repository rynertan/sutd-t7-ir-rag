# A NON AQUEOUS DYEING PROCESS

## Abstract
A substantially non aqueous process for the dyeing of a dyeable material at an elevated temperature comprises con tacting a dyeable material with a dye composition at an elevat ed temperature in a non reactive environment such as that pro vided by a fluorocarbon. The dye composition temperature and the time of contact between the dye composition and the dye able material are sufficient to effectuate the dyeing of the ma terial. The dye composition comprises a substantially non aqueous solvent and a dyestuff.
