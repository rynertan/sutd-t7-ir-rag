## Description
COMPOSITIONS FOR FORMING EPOXY ADHESIVE CONTAINING ACRYLATE RUBBERBackground of the Invention Field of the Invention The present invention relates to compositions for forming epoxy adhesive compositions containing acrylate rubber and to the compositions thus produced. Description of the Prior Art Various epoxy resin compositions that do not contain an acrylate rubber as a modifier are known to the prior art. For example, acrylic acid is suggested as a curing agent for epoxy resins in Rev. Gen. Caout.Plast. 1973 50 11 , 890 892. More recently. U.S. Patent No. 4,028,432 to F. Dawans has taught the use of polybutadiene having carboxylic substitution as a modifier for a liquid epoxide resin. The polymerization of a major amount of an alkyl methacrylate monomer, e.g., 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, in the presence of a minor amount of an epoxy resin to form adhesive compositions is shown in Japanese Kokai 78 57,237. More recently, U.S. Patent No. 4,051,195 to W. F.McWhorter suggested blending epoxide resin and a polyacrylate or polymethacrylate ester of a polyol which contained more than one terminal acrylate or methacrylate group. This blend could then be cured using conventional epoxide resin crosslinking agents. The compositions shown in this patent do not contain a monomer soluble initiator capable of reacting with a monoethylenically unsaturated alkyl acrylate or methacrylate to form an acrylate rubber moiety. In theMcWhorter compositions, the curing agent first reacts with the epoxide groups to form substituted amine and hydroxy groups. The thus formed amine will then react with the acrylate double bond. The result is the formation of substituted amine groups and saturated carbon to carbon linkages.Summary of the Present Invention The present invention relates to a reaction mixture comprising a a major amount of an epoxide resin b a minor amount of a monoethylenically unsaturated monomer capable of forming a polyacrylate rubber and c an effective amount of a monomer soluble initiator for forming the rubber from monomer b .As used herein the terminology polyacrylatet is intended to encompass those rubber compositions formed from both alkyl acrylate monomers as well as alkyl methacrylate monomers When the aforesaid reaction mixture is heated, the resulting curable composition, which is also part of the present invention, will comprise a major amount of epoxy resin modified with a minor amount of polyacrylate rubber. Description of the Preferred Embodiments The major cons tituent present in the reaction mixture described earlier which is used to form the curable adhesive compositions of the present invention is an epoxide resin such as conventionally used in the art to formulate epoxide adhesives. Generally, the reaction mixture and resulting polyacrylate modified epoxide compositions can contain from about 65 to about 99 , by weight, of the epoxide resin, preferably from about 80 to about 95 , by weight. The epoxide resins useful in this invention are those resins which contain more than one 1,2 epoxy group per molecule. They can be saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or heterocyclic and can be monomeric or polymeric in nature. The weight per epoxide of such resins will be within the range of about 100 to about 2,000. Preferably, the epoxide resins will contain glycidyl ether or ester groups, will be liquid rather than solid, and will have weight per epoxide in the range of about 110 to about 500, most preferably about 175 to about 250. Useful epoxide resins are the glycidyl polyethers of polyhydric phenols which are derived from an epihalohydrin, e.g., epichlorohydrin, and a polyhydric phenol. Examples of such polyhydric phenols include resorcinol, hydroquinone, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2,2propane, or bisphenol A as it is commonly called, 4,4 dihydroxybenzophenone, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1,1 ethane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl l,l isobutane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2,2 butane, bis 2 dihydroxynaphthyl methane, phloroglucinol, and bis 4 hydroxyphenyl sulphone. Additional polyhydric phenols are novolac resins containing more than two phenol, or substituted phenol, moieties linked through methylene bridges as well as halogenated, e.g., brominated and chlorinated, phenol compounds. Additional epoxide resins are glycidyl polyethers of polyhydric alcohols prepared by reacting a polyhydric alcohol with an epihalohydrin using an acidic catalyst, e.g., boron trifluoride, and subsequently treating the resulting product with an alkaline dehydrohalogenating agent. Included among the polyhydric alcohols that can be used in the preparation of these polyepoxides are glycerine, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, hexanediol, hexanetriol, trimethylol propane, trimethylol ethane, pentaerythritol and the like. Other epoxide resins are glycidyl esters of polycarboxylic acids which are derived from an epihalohydrin and a polycarboxylic acid. Examples of polycarboxylic acids include phthalic acid or its anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, adipic acid, dimerized fatty acids, dibasic acids made from an unsaturated fatty acid and acrylic acid, and the like. The most preferred epoxide resins are glycidyl polyethers or polyhydric phenols, particularly the glycidyl polyether of bisphenol A. The reaction mixture used to form the curable epoxy polyacry late rubbermodified compositions of this invention also contains a minor amount of an alkyl acrylate or alkyl methacrylate monomer or mixtures thereof capable of forming a rubbery particle having a Tg of less than about 4Q C. The amount of such monomer can range from about 1 to about 49 by weight of the epoxide resin, preferably about 5 to about 25 , by weight. Representative monomers which can be selected for use are the unsubstituted and substituted C1 to C20 alkyl acrylates and alkyl methacrylates and include n butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, 2butyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, and decyl methacrylate. The resulting curable epoxy polyacrylate rubber modified composition contains a similar major amount of epoxy resin and a similar minor amount of polyacrylate rubber derived from the aforesaid acrylate and or methacrylate monomers. The reaction mixture can also contain an optional cross linking agent for the acrylate and or methacrylate monomer component as well as an optional grafting agent for the polyacrylate rubber and epoxy. The crosslinking agent for the rubber forming monomer, or monomers, can be a polyethylenically unsaturated crosslinking monomer such as conventionally employed to form crosslinked acrylate and or methacrylate rubber polymers. It can be present at from about 0.01 to about 10 by weight of the monomers forming the rubber. Representative crosslinking agents, which contain at least two ethylenically unsaturated groups, include such compounds as allyl methacrylate, divinyl benzene, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, methylene bis acrylamine, diethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, divinyl ether, diallyl fumarate, diallyl phthalate, divinyl sulfone, divinyl carbitol, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, trimethylene glycol diacrylate, butylene glycol diacrylate, pentamethylene glycol diacrylate, glyceryl triacrylate, octylene glycol diacrylate, trimethylene propane triacrylate, the tetraacrylate ester of pentaerythritol, and various diallyl phosphonates. The grafting agent can be a difunctional monomer containing a vinyl group and an epoxy reactive func tonal group e.g., a carboxy group or containing a divinyl group and an epoxy group. Examples of suitable grafting agents include ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids e.g , the C2 C10 alkenyl carboxylic acids as well as the glycidyl esters of those acids.Representative compounds include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and glycidyl iriethacrylate. These grafting agents can be present at from about Q.1 to about 2C , by weight of the monomers forming the polyacrylate rubber. In order to form the curable epoxy modified with polyacrylate rubber of the present invention, the epoxy resin and rubber forming monomer optionally with either or both of crosslivnking and grafting agent are polymerized in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of a monomer soluble initiator, e.g., 0.01 to 10 , by weight of rubber forming monomer at a temperature e.g., 10 to 15Q C. and for a length of tims e.g., 0.1 to 5 1 hours to achieve formation of the rubber in the epoxy composition.Representative initiators include the azo initiators e.g., azobisisobutyronitrile , the peroxide initiators e.g., lauroyl or benzoyl peroxide , or the perioxydicarbonate initiators e.g., isopropylperoxy dicarbonate .If crosslinking agent is also present, the initiator will produce a crosslinked polyacrylate rubber. Presence of grafting agent will produce grafting of the polyacrylate rubber and epoxy resin. The epoxy resin composition containing polyacrylate rubber finds utility as one component in a curable adhesive system. It will generally comprise from about 1 to 99 , by weight of the curable system.The other major component of such a system is a curing agent for the epoxy resin and it can be present at from about 99 to about 1 , by weight of the system.Representative curing agents include aliphatic polyamines having at least 3 active amine hydrogen atoms per molecule. Examples of such amines are the polyalkylene polyamines, e.g., diethylene triamine, triethylene tetraamine, tetraethylene pentamine and pentaethylene hexamine. Additional useful amines are ethylene diamine, tetramethylene diamine, hexamethylene diamine, xylylene diamine, and the like. Adducts of such amines with acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, ethyl acrylate and the like are also useful if the adduct contains at least three active amine hydrogen atoms.Also included as useful amines are amidoamines obtained by reacting polyamines with fatty acids, both monomers and dimers, provided of course that the resulting amidoamine contains at least 3 active amine hydrogen atoms per molecule. Additional curing agents which can be used with the compositions of this invention include the amine terminated polyamides, aromatic amines, mercaptans, anhydrides, isocyanates, and catalyst latent hardeners such as boron trifluoride monoethylamine and dicyandiamide. If desired, the curing agent could, under certain circumstances, be used in the original reaction mixture containing epoxy resin, acrylate and or methacrylate rubber forming monomer, and initiator. If the ultimate user of the cured adhesive immediately employs the reaction mixture, heating of it will both form the rubber via action of the initiator and will also cure the adhesive via action of the curing agent. If a curable system is desired, however, the initiator will have to be selected so that it has activation conditions which are not satisfied when the initiator is activated to form the rubber. In this way, the reaction mixture can be heated, for example, to only form the rubber component optionally crosslinked and or grafted with the curing agent remaining in a latent state until activated at a later time, e.g., by being heated to a higher temperature. The curable compositions, or reaction mixture to form it, of the instant invention can be compounded with various fillers, reinforcing agents6 dyes, pigments and other additives depending upon the ultimate end use and desired propertiesv The compositions can also be dissolved in and used from solvents, e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, ether esters, etheralcohols, esters, alcohols, ketones and the like.However, these compositions can be used with no solvents, i.e., at 100 solids. The curing reaction, if desired, can be accelerated by heating, e.g., to a temperature of up to 3Q0 C., depending upon curing agent. The following Examples illustrate certain preferred embodiments of the present invention. EXAMPLE 1 This Example illustrates several embodiments of the present invention in which a curable polyacrylategrafted epoxy composition is formed, cured and evaluated as an adhesive. To the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A 250 gm.of EPON 828 diepoxide , having an epoxide equivalent of about 190, was added 25 gm. of butyl acrylate, 1.28 gm. of acrylic acid grafting agent, 0.25 gm. of diethylene glycol diacrylate crosslinker, and 1.0 gm. of benzoyl peroxide initiator. The mixture was heated at 80 850C. under nitrogen with stirring for about 10 18 hours. A portion of the resulting polyacrylategrafted epoxy composition was then mixed with an epoxide curing agent. Lap shear bonds were prepared by pressing a small amount of the mixture of epoxy resin composition between two acid etched steel panels, and the compositions were allowed to cure at 1500C. for 30 minutes. The tensile shear strength of the bond formed by the cured polyacrylate grafted epoxy was compared with that of the cured unmodified epoxy EPON 828 brand EXAMPLE 1 cont1d.

The above data indicate that the shear strength of the epoxy adhesive can be increased by incorporation of polyacrylate rubber. EXAMPLE 2 This illustrates other embodiments of the claimed invention. To the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A EPON 828 brand was added butyl acrylate, acrylic acid, diethylene glycol diacrylate, and benzoyl peroxide. The acrylate containing monomers in the epoxy were polymerized to form a crosslinked polyacrylate rubber by heating the mixture at 80 850C. A tri C8 C10 alkyl methyl ammonium chloride catalyst ADOGEN 464 from SherexChemical was then added for certain runs to assist the remaining stages of the reaction, and the resultiing mixture was heated at 1150C. for 4 hours. The acid number was determined before and after this latter heating step which produced grafting of the polyacrylic rubber and epoxy resin. A decrease in acid number indicates that the carboxy groups of the polyacrylate rubber reacted with the epoxy groups of the epoxy resin.All amounts of the reaction ingredients given in the Table below are parts by weight pbw EXAMPLE 2 cont d.
