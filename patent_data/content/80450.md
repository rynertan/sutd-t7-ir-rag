# Oxidation and ammoxidation catalyst.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein are catalysts useful for oxidation and am moxidation of hydrocarbons. Such catalysts have the empirical formula BiMo Catalysts according to the invention are prepared by form ing a slurry of a vanadium component, an antimony compo nent, a hydrophilic bismuth molybdate component having the empirical formula BiMo Such catalysts are specifically useful for production of acrylonitrile from propylene, ammonia and an oxygen containing gas.
