# A parachute.

## Abstract
Two ram air sections 1 , 1 are included in a parachute canopy 1. The sections 1 , 1 are arranged on opposite sides of a central axis X X, and face in opposite directions with respect to translational movement but the same direction with respect to rotational movement about the axis X X. The lower skins 3 of the sections 1 , 1 slope upwards from front to rear whereby the canopy rotates and the ram air sections create aero dynamic lift slowing descent.
