# SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANES AND METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME

## Abstract
The present invention provides a composition from which a semipermeable membrane may be made by pro cessing said composition at an elevated temperature, said composition comprising a mixture of polypropylene, a sec ond polymer and a processing aid, said processing aid and said polypropylene being compatible at said elevated tem perature and being incompatible when a heated mixture of said polypropylene and said processing aid is cooled to am bient temperature, said second polymer and said process ing aid being compatible when heated to said elevated tem perature and also being compatible when a heated mixture of said second polymer and said processing aid is cooled to ambient temperature, said mixture being compatible at said elevated temperature and exhibiting phase separation of at least said polypropylene at ambient temperature. The in vention further provides semipermeable membranes, and a process for making a semipermeable membrane.
