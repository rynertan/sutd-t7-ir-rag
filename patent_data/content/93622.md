# Short circuit current protection.

## Abstract
Apparatus for determining the prospective short circuit current at any position in an electrical installation comprising means for measuring the voltage at a predetermined point or points of a half cycle of the operating voltage between conductors at any position in an electrical installation switching means for connection and disconnection of an impedance between said conductors to cause a current to flow therebetween for a short period means for synchronis ing and sequencing operation of said voltage measuring means and actuation of said switching means means for measuring the differences in voltages caused by said current flow means for determining the differences in times of the half cycle caused by said current flow means associated with a random access memory and a read only memory, the random access memory storing said voltage measurements and time measurements and using a program previously stored in the read only memory derives the corresponding value of prospective short circuit current and, coupled to the memory associated means a display for providing direct reading of the short circuit current.
