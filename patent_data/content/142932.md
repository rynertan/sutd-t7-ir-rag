# A process for selective preparation of polymeric polyamines.

## Abstract
Polymeric polyamines are produced by an aminomethyl ation reaction wherein polymeric polyolefins such as polybu tadience and a nitrogen compound e.g. ammonia, primary or secondary amines and synthesis gas CO and Hâ‚‚ are reacted in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a ruthenium containing catalyst, such as triruthenium dodeca carbonyl, using a single phase or two phase solvent system. The use of a two phase solvent mixture e.g. one consisting of N,N dimethylformamide plus a hydrocarbon is particularly advantageous in that 1 The aminomethylation selectivity is improved and few side reactions result 2 The two phase liquid product mixture obtained allows easy separation of product polyamine from ruthe nium containing catalyst.
