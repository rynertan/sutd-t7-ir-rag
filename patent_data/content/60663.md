# A PROCESS FOR TRANSFORMING CERTAIN MICROORGANISMS, VECTORS AND THEIR PRODUCTION, AND A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING CERTAIN SUBSTANCES USING SAID VECTORS

## Abstract
The transformation of thermophilic gram positive or gram variable microorganisms using vector plasmids, vectors usable in such transformation and their preparation, and the use of such transformation followed by culturing of the trans formed microorganisms to produce a desired substance deriv able by phenotypical expression of a selected gene or genes incorporated in the vectors and hence in the genotype of the transformed microorganisms.
