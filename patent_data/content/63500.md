# Magnetic disk cartridge.

## Abstract
A cartridge 10 for a flexible magnetic disk 11 includes a rigid box with an opening 12 on one side which is normally closed by a slider 14 . When the cartridge is inserted into the drive, the slider 12 moves to the open position in which the disk 11 can be engaged to rotate it in read write relationship with a magnetic head. As the car tridge is inserted, a fixed Bernoulli plate in the drive enters the cartridge through an edge 19 thereof. The disk is rotated against the Bernoulli plate to provide stability.
