# Imaging method and apparatus using nuclear magnetic resonance.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is an NMR imaging apparatus for detecting a nuclear spin resonance signal from an object, which is placed in a magnetic field, to produce images of the object. At an instant when the spins come into phase after the signal detection by a first spin excitation, RF magnetic field pulses are applied for rotating the direction of the spin to that opposite to the initial state. After that, the spin excitation and the signal direction of second time are conducted to measure the data which are different in the effect of the relaxation time from the first measurements. By repeating these sequences, it is possible to produce a plurality of images such as an intensity image or a relaxation time enhanced image.
