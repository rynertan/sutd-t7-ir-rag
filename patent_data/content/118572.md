## Description
A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF DIENE STYRENE a METHYLSTYRENE BLOCK POLYMERS AND POLYMERS THEREFROM Block polymers of a methylstyrene and butadiene of the ABA configuration wherein A represents a block of a methylstyrene and B represents a butadiene block are disclosed in British Patent 1,444,680, and also described in the Journal of Applied Polymer Science,Volume 22, 2907 2913 1978 . However, a Methylstyrene has a relatively low ceiling temperature of about 610C, generally polymerization proceeds slowly and must be carried out at relatively low temperatures. It would be desirable if there were an improved process for the preparation of diene a methylstyrene containing block polymers which would permit relatively rapid polymerization of monomers to produce thermoplastic elastomers and impact resistant thermoplastic resins. These benefits are achieved in a process for the preparation of block polymers by the sequential polymerization of at least one conjugated diene monomer to form a diene polymer block and copolymerization of a vinyl aromatic monomer and an isopropenylaromatic monomer to form a vinylaromatic isopropenylaromatic polymer block.The process is further characterized in that the polymerization is 1 conducted in a solvent comprising the isopropenylaromatic monomer present in an excess of at least 2 moles per liter of reaction mixture, 2 initiated by a lithium based polymerization initiator, and 3 carried out at a temperature of 200 to 1600C, and preferably from 450 to 1600C, during the formation of the vinylaromatic isopropenylaromatic polymer block to thereby provide a diene vinylaromatic isopropenylaromatic block copolymer wherein the mole ratio of vinylaromatic monomer to isopropenylaromatic monomer is from 50 1 to 1 50 and advantageously from 2 1 to 1 2.5. Also contemplated within the scope of the present invention is a block copolymer of the formulaAB BA n wherein n has a value of 0 or greater, preferably a value equal to or less than 20 A represents a block of a copolymer of vinylaromatic isopropenylaromatic monomer wherein the ratio of vinylaromatic to isopropenylaromatic monomer is from 50 1 to 1 50 and preferably from 2 1 to 1 2.5 B is a diene polymer block wherein the diene is selected from a group consisting of 1,3 butadiene and isoprene and mixtures thereof containing 0 to 40 weight percent of aromatic monomer copolymerizable therewith and the weight ratio of A block to B blo k varies from 50 1 to 1 50 and is preferably 90 10 and 10 90. By the term vinylaromatic monomer is meant a monovinylaromatic monomer of the formula EMI3.1 Formula I wherein R1, R2 and R3 are individually selected from the group of hydrogen radicals, alkyl radicals, with the further limitation that the total number of carbon atoms in R1, R2, and R3 is not greater than ten, and mixtures thereof. Such vinylaromatic monomers include styrene, methylstyrene, ethylstyrene, dimethylstyrene, trimethylstyrene, tertiary butylstyrene, tertiaryamylstyrene, tertiary hexylstyrene, octylstyrene, 2 ethylhexylstyrene, and decyistyrene. Any isomer of the foregoing monomers is useful in the process of the invention. However for most applications, the para isomer is preferred such as para methylstyrene. By the term isopropenylaromatic monomer is meant a monoisopropenylaromatic monomer of the formula EMI3.2 Formula II wherein Rl, R2 and R3 are defined as above. Such isopropenylaromatic monomers include a methylstyrene and p isopropenyltoluene. By the term aromatic monomer is meant a monomer of Formula I or Formula II and mixtures thereof. The resultant block copolymers may be elastomeric or resinous depending upon the proportions of the ingredients selected. Polymers prepared employing low portions of the diene, i.e., 2 to 40 weight percent polydiene, are generally resinous, transparent, and particularly suited for packaging applications wherein both low temperatures and high temperatures are encountered for example, frozen foods which are subsequently heated prior to serving. Polymers in accordance with the present invention which contain higher proportions of the polydiene block, for example, from 50 to 80 weight percent polydiene, provide desirable thermoplastic elastomers having a relatively high service temperature and highly desirable low temperature characteristics. Polymers of the invention containing over 80 to 98 weight percent polydiene are elastomers of improved green strength.Polymers containing from about 40 to 50 weight percent diene are what might be considered soft plastics. The molecular weight of the block copolymer in accordance with the present invention as determined by gel permeation chromatography will vary from about 5,000 to 800,000 molecular weight units. Particularly desirable polymers for most applications have a molecular weight range from about 20,000 to 500,000 molecular weight units. Preferably the polymer blocks B are elastomeric polymer blocks of an unsaturated diene such as butadiene, isoprene or mixtures thereof containing from 0 to 40 weight percent of aromatic monomer copolymerizable therewith such as styrene, or methylstyrene, a methylstyrene or mixtures thereof. It is essential to the present invention that the 1,2 vinyl polydiene microstructure content of the polydiene block be not greater than 25 percent, the 1,2 vinyl content being computed from the infrared spectrum by the method of P.Morero et al., as set forth in Chim, Ind. Milan, 41, 758 1959 . Block copolymers in accordance with the present invention may be of the linear AB or ABA configuration or the branched configuration such as AB BA n Also the possibility exists for preparing two types of sequential polymer blocks depending on the conditions of the anionic copolymerization. A two stage sequential addition and polymerization of the diene and.vinylaromatic monomer will give a pure block polymer. However, a graded or tapered block polymer will be obtained by polymerizing a mixture of the diene and vinyl aromatic monomer in the presence of excess a methylstyrene. Typically such tapered block polymers may contain 0.1 to 40 weight percent of the A block monomer in the B block and 0 to 10 weight percent of the B block monomer in the A block. In the preparation of a linear polymer such as of the ABA configuration, a difunctional lithium initiator may be employed whereas in the preparation of the simplest branched or radial polymer having the structure AB BA n a polyfunctional ormultifunctiona1 lithium polymerization initiator may be employed. By the term simplest is meant the index n in AB BA n is equal to or less than 3. In the preferred polymers of the invention n has an average value of 1 or greater and the junction between the A and B blocks may be tapered or nontapered. Such tapered block copolymers are particularly useful in the high impact resin blends of U.S. Patent 3,906,058. Multi functional lithium containing initiators are well known in the art as is the use of such initiators in the polymerization of olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbon monomers. Such polymers and initiators are disclosed in the following U.S. Patents 3,660,536 3,653,634 3,668,263 3,684,780 3,725,368 3,734,973 3,776,893 3,776,964 3,784,637 3,787,510 3,954,894 4,172,100 4,172,190 4,182,818 4,196,153 4,196,154 4,200,718 4,201,729 and 4,205,016. It is known that very desirable lithium initiators can be prepared by the addition of two moles of an organolithium compound, such as butyllithium, to one mole of a compound containing two 1, l diphenylethylene groups. The method of the present invention can be used in a variety of ways. For example in the preparation of AB block copolymer employing an initiator such as secondary butyllithium or normal butyllithium, several procedures may be used. A tapered AB block copolymer can be prepared by admixing the isopropenylaromatic monomer such as a methylstyrene, diene and vinylaromatic monomer such as styrene, adding initiator to provide a tapered AB polymer. Alternatively isopropenylaromatic monomer and diene are admixed, initiator added, the diene polymerized, subsequently the vinyl aromatic monomer is added to the reaction mixture in a continuous or stepwise manner to provide a polymer with a polybutadiene block attached to a vinyl aromatic monomer isopropenylaromatic monomer copolymer block.A similar block copolymer can be prepared by admixing the isopropenylaromatic monomer with the vinylaromatic monomer and immediately after the vinyl aromatic isopropenylaromatic monomer copolymerization is complete, the diene is added resulting in AB polymer with a polydiene block and an isopropenylaromatic vinylaromaticmonomer copolymer block. ABA polymers are readily prepared employing the method of the present invention, employing a difunctional organolithium initiator by admixing, for example, a methylstyrene, styrene and diene, adding initiator and on polymerization a tapered ABA a methylstyrene styrene diene polymer is obtained wherein the A block has polymerized therein from 0 to 10 weight percent of the diene monomer and the B block has polymerized therein from 0.1 to 40 weight percent aromatic monomer. Alternatively, the isopropenylaromatic monomer such as a methylstyrene and diene are admixed, the initiator added, on completion of the polymerization of the diene, the vinylaromatic monomer such as styrene is added to provide an ABA a methylstyrene styrene terminal block and a polydiene central block.Polymers of the ABA configuration are also prepared using monofunctional initiator such as secondary butyllithium or a normal butyllithium by admixing the isopropenyl aromatic monomer and vinylaromatic monomer, adding initiator, on completion copolymerization of the aromatic monomers the diene monomer is added, on completion of polymerization of the diene a coupling agent is introduced to the reaction mixture thereby providing a polymer of ABA configuration. Another route to an ABA polymer is to admix the aromatic monomers with a monofunctional initiator, when copolymerization of the vinyl aromatic monomer is complete, diene monomer is added, on completion of polymerization of the diene monomer additional vinyl aromatic monomer is provided to the reaction mixture resulting in an ABA polymer having a polydiene center block and aromatic monomer copolymer terminal blocks.Alternatively a vinylaromatic isopropenylaromatic monomer mixture may be initiated and prior to completion of the copolymerization, diene monomer is added, also resulting in a polymer having ABA configuration. So called radial, star or multi armed polymers desirably are prepared employing a polyfunctional initiator using the general procedure set forth wherein a tapered diene polymer block copolymer may be obtained or a homo polydiene block obtained depending upon the sequence of monomer addition. An alternate route to radial block copolzmers is to prepare a living polymer of the AB configuration employing a multifunctional coupling agent for example, silicon tetrachloride, or divinylbenzene. The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples. All reactions and polymer izations were conducted under a dry nitrogen atmosphere.All glass containers were baked at 1500C overnight, and flushed with nitrogen before use. The transfer of monomers and reagents was carried out with nitrogen flushed syringes.
