## Description
AN ANTACID COMPOSITION AND A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOFAluminum hydroxide in wet gel form, i.e. in the form of a liquid suspension, has many ideal antacid properties. However, conventional wet gels contain only relatively low solids contents of active antacid, and typically contain 80 to 90 water. The transportation and storage of the wet gels are thus somewhat inefficient and expensive. Further, the wet gels are not particularly well adapted to the preparation of very concentrated liquid antacids. Solid forms of antacid are not subject to these disadvantages. Further, solid forms of antacid, e.g. in tablet form, are very popular with consumers because they are much more convenient and may be carried in small containers and taken as needed without requiring a spoon or other measure for measuring out the dosage.Proposals have been made for the preparation of solid antacid compositions by spray drying aqueous slurries of aluminum hydroxide gel containing heat stabilizers. For example U.S.Patent 3,272,704 dated September 13, 1966 in the flare S.M. Beekman discloses co spray drying mixed aqueous gels of aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxycarbonate and magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate or magnesium trisilicate, together with various heat stabilizers which stabilize the aluminum containing gel and reduce the extent to which the antacid activity of the gel is impaired by the drying process.Nevertheless, the use of antacid preparations in solid or tablet form has been considered to be subject to numerous disadvantages and limitations. Since tablets require mastication in the mouth they may not break up into the fine particle size exhibited by the conventional wet gel liquid suspensions which will easily reach the gastric areas affected by hyperacidity. Solid or tablet preparations which may exhibit good theoretical antacid reactivity, as determined by standard in vitro testing procedures, may not exhibit desired antacid reactivties in actual in vivo conditions of use. Typically, antacids in solid or tablet form are slower to give relief from symptoms of hyperacidity because the antacid reactivity originally possessed by the aqueous gel form antacid is much impaired by the step of drying it to the solid form.Recently, methods have been developed for the preparation of aluminum hydroxycarbonate gels by continuous processing. The gels thus obtained exhibit fast acid consuming reactivity even after the gel products are thoroughly washed to remove non aluminum cations. The continuous processing reactions and the products obtained thereby are described in more detail in CanadianPatent No. 1,154,932 and in European Patent. Application No. 83306293.8. It has now been found that when fast reacting aluminium hydroxycarbonate gel materials, having low molar ratios as typified, for example, by the products obtained from the above mentioned continuous processing methods, are co spray dried with a heat stabilizer, dry antacid compositions can be obtained exhibiting surprisingly fast acid consuming reactivities.The dried product may be used as such as an antacid or its acid consuming reactivity may be utilised in forming desired dry, solid aluminum and magnesium combining antacid compositions. Thus, the spray dried aluminum hydroxycarbonate gel product may be blended with basic magnesium antacid materials, or the magnesium antacid material may be admixed with the wet hydroxycarbonate gel and the mixture may be co dried from the slurry state to form aluminum magnesium antacid preparations. Most unexpectedly, it has been found dry products can thus be obtained having in vivo intragastric buffering effects which are superior to those of conventional liquid suspension antacid preparations administered in dosages of comparable acid consuming power.Further, the dried materials have the advantages that they are much easier and much less expensive to transport, and may be resuspended and rehydrated on admixture with water and flavour under high shear stirring conditions to yield smooth, highly concentrated liquid antacids.In one aspect, the present invention provides an antacid composition comprising a co spray dried mixture of aluminum hydroxycarbonate and a water soluble, orally ingestible heat stabilier therefor, containing about 35 to about 450 parts by weight of said stabilizer per 100 parts of the hydroxycarbonate dry basis calculated as Al203 , and up to about 20 moisture by weight, and wherein said composition has a molar ratio of non aluminum cations to aluminum cations of less than about 0.01 1, and its standard pR stat reactivity times T50 less than about 25 minutes and Tgg less than about 70 minutes.As noted above, desirably, the dried product of the invention is characterized by certain standard pH stat reactivity times.These reactivity times, as used throughout the present specification and claims, refer to the reactivity times determined by the pH stat reactivity test described by Xerkhof et al, J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 66, 1528 1977 . In this test, lNBCl is added to the antacid composXtion undergoing test at a controlled rate such that a constant pH of 3.0 is maintained during the reaction. Unless otherwise specified, the test results referred to herein are obtained at a reaction temperature of 25C. The volume of acid added is plotted against time. This plot can be characterized by T50 and Tgg times, i.e. the times in minutes taken to consume respectively 50 and 90 of the total amount of acid added until neutralization.The volume of acid added can also be converted to the percentage total acid consuming power t TACP TACP Vol. acid consumed in titration x 100 Theoretical maximum volumeIn the case in which the antacid is aluminum hydroxycarbonate, for example, the 8 TACP is given by 8 TACP ml of 1N HCl x 102 x tO9 mg of hydroxycarbonate x Al203 x 6 Where 102 Molecular weight of A1203 6 Theoretical number of moles of acid consumed per mole Al203 The e standard pH stat reactivity T50 and Tg0 times thus provide a significant indication of the reactivity of the antacid material.In the course of the spray drying operation, even in the presence of the heat stabilizer, some loss of reactivity does of course take place. As noted above, in the spray dried products in accordance with the invention, the T50 and Tgg reactivity times should be less than about 25 minutes and less than about 70 minutes, respectively.More desirably, the T50 and Tg0 times are less than about 20 minutes and less than about 65 minutes, respectively. in order to achieve the desired relatively short reactivity times in the dried product, the starting material hydroxycarbonate wet gel should desirably possess prior to drying standard pH stat reactivity times of T50 less than about 20 minutes, and Tgg each less than about 25 minutes, more preferably with T50 and Tgg each less than about 10 minutes. As the acid consuming reactivities of the aluminum hydroxycarbonate gel materials tend to decline on prolonged storage, desirably the aluminum hydroxycarbonate gel material employed is one freshly obtained from a gel precipitation method.As noted above, the product should also contain relatively low contents of non aluminum cations. The presence of significant quantities of sodium or like cations is undesirable for dietetic reasons, and, further, products containing relatively low contents of non aluminum cations may be desirable in order to meet requirements for maximum contents of non aluminum cations prescribed for certain products. Thus, desirably, the starting material wet aluminum hydroxycarbonate gel material used as the starting material in the preparation of the present products has a molar ratio of non aluminum cations to aluminum cations of less than about 0.01 1, more preferably less than about 0.005 1. Aluminum hydroxycarbonate gels, having fast reactivities and low contents of non aluminum cations can be made, for example, by the continuous processing methods described in the above mentionedCanadian patent 1,154,932 and co pending European Patent Application No. 83306293.8, but the products of the present invention are not essentially limited to products derived from the hydroxycarbonate gel materials obtained from these processes, but can be achieved using starting material hydroxycarbonate wet gels of comparably fast reactivity and low non aluminum cation content.The preparation of the aluminum hydroxycarbonate gel material by the above noted continuous processing methods is, however, attended by various advantages such as relatively high rates of throughput and small size of apparatus used for the iranufacturing procedure, permitting significant economies to be achieved in the manufacturing process. Frther, the continuous processing methods permit the gel product to be formed under highly homogeneous conditions, leading to a relatively high content of carbonate ion in the product which is permanently bound to the aluminum hydroxide molecular structure, thus permitting the gels to be well washed to significantly reduce their content of non aluminum cations without concomitant signficant loss of reactivity of the gels.It is known that the acid consuming reactivity of the gel is related to the presence of carbonate ion in the gel product. Typically, the well washed hydroxycarbonate gel products obtained from the continuous processing methods will have molar ratios of CO32 ion to Al3 ion of from about 0.4 to about 0.8 1, more typically from about 0.45 to about 0.7 1.Because of the numerous advantages attendant on these materials, it is, therefore, highly preferred to employ the hydroxycarbonate gel materials obtained from the above noted continuous processing methods as the starting material used in the preparation of the present spray dried product.The above described spray dried aluminum hydroxycarbonate material can advantageously be used as such as an antacid. More advantageously, the material can be used in the preparation of dry powder or semi dry pulverizable magnesium aluminum antacid compositions by blending the spray dried hydroxycarbonate product with magnesium carbonate and or magnesium hydroxide in paste or powder form using conventional mixing apparatus. Any commercially available form of magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide powder or water containing paste which is in a state of purity rendering it acceptable for oral ingestion may be employed.More preferably, however, the magnesium. corpound in paste or powder form is added to the wet hydroxycarbonate gel, together with the heat stabilizer, and the wet mixture is co spray dried to yield a dry magnesium and aluminum containing product mixture. It has been found that the presence of the magnesium compound in the wet slurry employed in the spray drying procedure tends to further stabilize the aluminum hydroxycarbonate material against loss of acid consuming reactivity during the spray drying procedure, thus leading to products which have somewhat greater acid consuming reactivities than those of mixtures of comparable chemical constitution formed by mixing the magnesium compound with the spray dried aluminum hydroxycarbonate material in the dry state.In order to achieve products having desired antacid properties and wherein the content of mildly laxative magnesium compound tends to counteract the constipating action of the aluminum containing component of the preparation, desirably the quantity of the magnesium compound combined with the aluminum hydroxycarbonate material, whether before or after spray drying is an amount yielding in the final product an atomic ratio of Mg Al ranging from about 0.5 to about 2.8 1.The basic magnesium compounds tend to exhibit a somewhat faster initial acid consuming reactivity than the aluminum hydroxycarbonate material, and thus the standard pH stat reactivity times of the magnesium and aluminum containing mixtures, particularly the T50 times of the mixed compositions, and, to a lesser extent the Tgg times, are reduced as compared with corresponding compositions containing solely the aluminum hydroxycarbonate material. Thus, mixtures having T50 times less than about 10 minutes and Tgg times less than about 15 minutes can readily be achieved.Thus, in accordance with a further aspect of the invention, there is provided an antacid composition comprising a co spray dried mixture of a basic magnesium compound selected from the group consisting of magnesium carbonate, magnesium, hydroxide, and mixtures thereof, aluminum hydroxycarbonate and water soluble, orally ingestible heat stabilizer for the flydroxycarbonate and containing about 35 to about 450 parts by weight of said stabilizer per 100 parts of the hyroxycrjonate dry basis calculated as A1203 , and up to about 20t by weight moisture, and containing said magnesium compound in an amount yielding an atomic ratio Mg Al of from about 0.5 to about 2.8 1, the composition having a molar ratio of non magnesium and non aluminum cations to aluminum cations of less than about 0.01 1, and its standard pH stat reactivity times T50 less than about 10 minutes and Tgg less than about 15 minutes.Preferably, the contents of magnesium compound in the mixture will be such as to yield an atomic ratio Mg Al of from about 0.7 to about 2 1, still more preferably from about 0.8 to about 1.6 1.Typically, the standard pH stat reactivity times of the mixed products formed by co spray drying a mixture of the magnesium compound, stabilizer, and the hydroxycarbonate gel material fro the wet state, will be T50 less than about 5 minutes and Tgg less than about 10 minutes.By reason of its ready availability, wide acceptance as an antacid material, and excellent acid consuming properties, preferably the magnesium compound employed is magnesium hydroxide. Preferably, the magnesium compound, whether added before or after spray drying is employed in the form of the commercially available aqueous based pastes, as these tend to give products with better taste than equivalent products made using the magnesium compound in powder form. The heat stabilizer incorporated in the wet slurry of aluminum hydroxide gel or mixed slurry of magnesium compound and aluminum hydroxycarbonate gel prior to spray drying should be watersoluble, and should be of a standard of purity and in itself non toxic and non irritating to the gastric tract and free from toxic or irritating impurities, such that it is acceptable for oral ingestion. Various suitable materials are known which tend to stabilize aluminum hydroxide and hydroxycarbonate gel materials against impairment of their acid consuming reactivities during hot drying.Frequently, these trials are water soluble polyhydroxy compounds or relatively low molecular weight water soluble organic polymers which on drying from aqueous solution tend to yield a gumrry film or residue. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it appears that the stabilizer materials, which, when dissolved, form part of the continuous aqueous phase in which the individual hydroxycarbonate gel particles are dispersed, tend to enrobe or coat the individual gel particles during the spray drying operation, thus physically shielding them from the hot gases to which the slurry particles are exposed during the spray drying process.Examples of suitable stabilizer materials include glycine, hexitols such as sorbitol and mannitol, orally ingestible di or tri hydroxy alcohols such as butylene glycol and glycerine, poly vinylpyrrolidone , methyl cellulose, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Frequently, the stabilizer materials not only stabilize the antacid reactivity of the materials auring the spray drying process, but also tend to stabilize the antacid reactivity of the dried products over prolonged periods of storage. Many of these stabilizer materials are also suspending aids, which facilitate the re constitution of the spray dried material, permitting it to be reconstituted with water under high shear mixing to form concentrated liquid antacid suspensions.Further, many of these stabilizer materials are tabletting aids, which facilitate the compaction of the dry powder products direct into tablet form using conventional tabletting presses.Especially preferred for the purposes of the present invention are the hexitols such as mannitol and sorbitol, by reason of their excellent stabilizing properties, and by reason of their efficacy as re suspension and tabletting aids. Because of its wide availability in a state of orally ingestible purity and its wide acceptance as an excipient and relatively low cost, sorbitol is particularly preferred. In order to achieve adequate stabilization of the hydroxycarbonate gel material against impairment of its reactivity during tne spray drying operation a certain minimum weight ratio of the heat stabilizer to the hydroxycarbonate should be present. It is convenient for this purpose to calculate the amount of hydroxycarbonate present in terms of its A1203 content.The amount of the stabilizer present in the slurry prior to spray drying should be at least about 35 parts by weight per 100 parts of the hydroxycarbonate, dry basis calculated as Al2O3 . The use of excessive quantities of the stabilizer in the slurry is to be avoided, because the use of amounts above a certain level does not appear to contribute increased stabilizing effect and merely results in increased consumption of the stabilizer and can result in products which have undesirably low concentrations of active antacid material.Desirably, the amount of stabilizer should be no more than about 450 parts by weight per 100 parts of hydroxycarbonate dry basis calculated as A1203 . More preferably, the content of the stabilizer is about 80 to about 280 parts by weight, and still more preferably about 110 to 190 parts by weight per 100 parts of the hydroxycarbonate, dry basis calculated as Awl203 . In the spray drying operation, which can be conducted using conventional spray drying apparatus, it is desired to reduce the moisture content of the slurry, which typically will initially be about 70 to about 85 , to no more than about 20 , more preferably about 5 to about 15 , and still more preferably to about 10 by weight, in order to yield a free flowing powder product which is dry to the touch and which can readily be handled and transported and can be re constituted to form concentrated liquid suspensions or can be pressed into tablets, with the addi ion if necessary of conventional re suspending or tabletting aids.In order to avoid excessive impairment of the pH stat reactivity times and percentTACP of the product, it is desirable to expose the material in the spray drying operation to drying gases of relatively low temperature. Desirably, the drying is conducted employing dryer gas which at no point in the spray drying tower or other spray drying apparatus has a temperature in excess of about 4000C, more preferably no more than about 3000C. ExamplesExample 1A well washed wet aluminum hydroxycarbonate gel was obtained, prepared by the continuous processing method described in co pending European Patent ApplicationNb. 83306293.8. The wet gel had a content of the hydroxycarbonate corresponding to 10.56 A1203 by weight, an Na Al molar ratio of 0.003 1, a C032 A13 ratio of 0.517 1, standard pH stat reactivity times T50 6.3 minutes, Tgg 8.7 minutes, and TACP r 97.9.The wet gel material was mixed with sorbitol solution USP in an amount yielding in the mixture a content of 62 by weight of the sorbitol in the composition, dry basis, or approximately 220 parts by weight of the sorbitol per 100 parts of the hydroxycarbonate, dry basis calculated as A1203 . The sorbitol dissolved in the aqueous phase.The resulting mixture was fed as a slurry to a conventional spray drying apparatus employing a two fluid atomization nozzle and equipped with a cyclone for receiving the spray dried product. The rate of feed of the slurry was about 18 kg hr, the hot air supplied to the dryer had an inlet air temperature of about 343 C, an outlet air temperature of about 107 C. The spray dried powder product recovered had a moisture content of about 108.

Example 2An aluminum hydroxycarbonate gel slurry was obtained similar to that described in example 1. A blend of 22.83 Kg of this gel plus 15 Xg of a 30 W W Mg OH 2 paste USP, and 5.61 Kg of a 70t W W Sorbitol USP solution was made.To this mixture, 20 Kg of water was added to make the blend pumpable and 30 ml of 5 hypochlorite bleach was added to prevent bacterial contamination of the slurry yielding a mixture containing a weight ratioMg OH 2 aluminum hydroxycarbonate measured as A1203 of 1.87 1 corresponding to an Mg Al atomic ratio of about 1.63 1 , and having a sorbitol content of about 163 parts by weight per 100 parts aluminum hydroxycarbonate, dry basis calculated as Awl203 . This mixture was then fed to the spray dryer at 21.5Xg hr with the inlet dryer temperature of 315 C and an outlet temperature of 107it, yielding 12.7 Kg of powder.The dry product obtained had a moisture content of about 10 , an acid consuming power of 22.47 meq g, t TACP of 98.9 and standard pH stat reactivity times T50 4.0 minutes and Tgg 19.7 minutes.The dried product could be reconstituted with water and flavour under high shear stirring to form a smooth, pleasant tasting, highly concentrated liquid antacid. Further, the dry compositior could be pressed on conventional tabletting equipment to form antacid tablets.Example 3An aluminum hydroxycarbonate gel slurry was obtained having a content of hydroxyearbonate measured as Awl203 13.07 8 by weight, an Naval molar ratio 0.0054, a C032 Al3 molar ratio of 0.476, and having standard pH stat reactivity times T50 15.6 minutes, Tg0 24.9 minutes and having t TACP 99.8.The gel slurry was well mixed with sorbitol USP solution and with a commercially available aqueous paste of magnesium hydroxide USP, yielding a mixture containing a weight ratio Mg OH 2 aluminum hy6roxycarbonate measured as A1203 of 1.02 1 corresponding to an Mg Al atomic ratio of about 0.89 1 , and having a sorbitol content of about 130 parts by weight per 100 parts aluminum hydroxycarbonate, dry basis calculated as At203 . The slurry mixture was co spray dried under the drying conditions described above in Example 1. A dry product was obtained having a moisture content of about 10 , an acid consuming power of 22.17 meq g, t TACP of 99.7 and standard ps stat reactivity times T50 5.3 minutes and Tgg 16.8 minutes.The dried product could be reconstituted with water under highshear stirring to form a smooth, pleasant tasting, highly concentrated liquid antacid. Further, the dry composition could be pressed on conventional tabletting equipment to form antacid tablets.Example 4An aluminum hydroxycarbonate gel slurry was obtained having a content of hydroxycarbonate measured as A1203 of 7.128 by weight, a Na A1 molar ratio 0.0043 1, a C032 A13 molar ratio of 0.757, and having standard pH stat reactivity times T50 4.1 minutes, Tg0 7.5 minutes and having TACP 100.5.The gel slurry was well mixed with sorbitol USP solution and with a commercially available aqueous paste of magnesium hydroxideU.S.P., yielding a mixture containing a weight ratioMg OH 2 aluminum hydroxycarbonate measured as A1203 of 1.77 1 corresponding to an Mg Al atomic ratio of about 1.55 1 , and having a sorbitol content of about 326 parts by weight per 100 parts aluminum hydroxycarbonate, dry basis calculated as Al2O3 . The resulting slurry mixture was fed to a conventional spraydrying apparatus employing a rotary atomizer and equipped with a cyclone for receiving the spray dried product. The rate of feed of the slurry was about 51 Kg hr, the hot air supplied to the dryer had an inlet air temperature of about 290 C, an outlet air temperature of about 60 to 102 C, and was supplied at a rate of about 630 Kg hr. The spray dried powder product was obtained having a moisture content about 8t and a sorbitol content of 50t. The magneRium aluminum ratio was 1 1 calculated as the weight ratio of Mg OH 2 Al OH 3 . pH stat reactivity tests on the dried composition using the standard pH stat reactivity test described above, gave T50 and Tgg times of 2.9 and 5.0 minutes respectively, an acid consuming powder of 18.36 meq g and a TACP of 100.29. The composition was pressed into tablets, each of which had an acid neutralization capacity 13.25 meq. Each tablet contained a weight of aluminum hydroxycarbonate equivalent to 200 mg dried aluminum hydroxide gel and 200 mg of magnesium hydroxide.pH stat reactivity tests on the tablets gave T50 and Tgg times of 2.7 and 7.8 minutes, respectively and a TANC of 96.7 .Two of these tablets were given in the antacid clinical study for a total ANC of 26.5.Example 5Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings shows a graph of intragastric pH against time following oral administration of various antacid compositions. The procedure of Example 2 was followed to obtain a co spray dried antacid composition of moisture content about 108 and of which about 30 of the solids content of the composition was sorbitol. The magnesium aluminum ratio was 1 1 calculated as the weight ratio Al OH 3 Mg OH 2 . pH stat reactivity tests on the dried composition using the standard pH stat reactivity test described above, gave T50 and Tgg times of 4.0 and 19.7 minutes, respectively and a TACP of 98.9. The composition was pressed into tablets, each of which had an acid neutralization capacity ANC determined by the USP XX test of 26.01 meq. Each tablet contained a weight of aluminum hydroxycarbonate equivalent to 400 mg Al OH 3, which contains 53.75 aluminum oxide, and 400 mg of Mg OH 2. The intragastric buffering effect of the antacid tablets was compared with that of two commercially available liquid nagnesium aluminum antacid suspensions. In vitro assay of liquid suspension A indicated pH stat reactivity times of T50 19.4 minutes Tg0 30.8 minutes and TANC of 99.3. Liquid suspension B gave pH stat reactivity times of T50 26.9 minutes, Tgg more than 70 minutes, and TANC of 90.5. Each of these liquid suspensions contained, per 5ml dose, 600 mg aluminum hydroxide equivalent to dried gel at 53.75 A1203 and 300 mg hg OH 2. Testing was performed with ten fasting normal adult subjects. In successive tests each subject received two tablets described inExample 4, one of the above described tablets, one 5 ml dose of liquid suspension A, having an ANC of 28.4 meq 5 ml and a 5 ml dose of liquid suspension B, having an ANC of 26.8 meq 5 ml.Before and during the course of the testing, intragastric pH readings were determined by measurement of the pH of aspirated samples of gastric fluid. The aspiration samples were obtained by means of a naso gastric tube positioned in the antrum region of the stomach.Baseline pH measurements were made before administraton of any tablet or liquid suspension at 5 minute intervals until three consecutive readings or pH 2.0 or less were obtained. After administration of the liquid suspension or tablet, p was determined at 2 minute intervals up to 10 minutes after aarinistration and at 5 minute intervals thereafter until the pH returned to baseline or 60 minutes time had elapsed. After each administration of the tablet or suspension, the tablet was chewed ana swallowed or each 5 ml suspension was swallowed, and in each instance the administration was followed by 50 ml of distilled water.The mean intragastric pH profiles obtained with the antacid tablet and with the two liquid antacid suspensions are shoun in the graph of the accompanying drawing. As will be noted from the graph, the buffering parameters of the peak pH reached, the tiros the pH was elevated beyond pH 3.5 and of the duration of the buffering effect above the base line, above pH 3, and above pE 3.5 were all significantly greater with the antacid tablet than those obtained with the liquid suspensions A and B. Thus the tablet formulatión exhibited superior intragastric buffering efficacy as compared with the commercially available liquid suspensions, particularly having regard to the fact that the ACP of the tablet 25.4 meq was somewhat less than each 5 ml dose of liquid suspension A and liquid suspension B 28.4 and 26.8 meq respectively .
