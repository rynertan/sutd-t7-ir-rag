# Process for sweetening petroleum fractions.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for treating hydrocarbon streams by the catalyzed oxidation of mercaptans to disulfides. In the process, the hydrocarbon containing stream is admixed with air and then passed through an oxidation zone 15 . The oxidation zone effluent is decanted to remove an aqueous alkaline solution in a high pressure separation zone 8 . It is then depressurized into a low pressure separator 13 in which dissolved excess nitrogen oxygen are substantial ly removed from the hydrocarbons. The treated hydrocar bons are then pressurized 17 to force their flow into a low pressure product receiving facility. This sequence eliminates or minimizes the discharge of gaseous nitrogen and oxygen and hydrocarbon vapors in the storage facility, where they are pollution abatement problems and possible safety hazards.
