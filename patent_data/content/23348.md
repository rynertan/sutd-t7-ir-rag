# A.C. arc welder.

## Abstract
An a.c. arc welder includes a reactor between a source of a.c. power and a welding load for accumulating energy during the increase of voltage from the source. A bypass circuit is further provided in parallel to the reactor and the welding load for dissipating the accumulated energy as a welding current through the load.
