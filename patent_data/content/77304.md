The conveyor arms 14 after having picked up the products 18 from the supply lines 22 , distribute them according to the previous selection, on a series of mobile brackets 28 32 along sloped 45 surfaces. Each bracket makes up a product 18 stacking station in which a stack of products, of equal quality is formed and is then picked up by the conveyor arms 14 and directed to the packing or to other operations. These supply lines synchronize the movement of the products 18 , with that of the conveyor arms 14 with chains 136 provided with teeth 23 , coordinated with pairs of conveyor belts 137, 138 of a different speed.
