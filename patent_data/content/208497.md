## Description
The present invention relates to diamino androstane derivatives, to a process for their preparation and to pharmaceu tical compositions containing them. There are certain 2, 16 diamino androstane derivatives known in the art, which shown curare like muscle relaxant activity. Of these, the compounds disclosed in united States Patent Specification No. 3,553,212 have a shortened duration of activity, while compounds with a more extended duration of action are disclosed in British Patent Specification No. 1,398,050. Since the administration of these compounds is far from being free from any risk, an extensive research is going on to find new derivatives with an extremely short or inter mediate duration of activity or having an onset time as close to administration as possible. E. Janos et al, Proc. Int. Symp. Instrum. High Peform. Thin Layer Chromatogr. 2nd 1982 , 186 describes quatemary ammonio steroids wich do not possess methyl groups at positions 10 and 13 of the steroid ring structure. US A 4071515 describes C₂, C₆, C Our research activity in this field has resulted in the discovery of a range of biologically active 6, 16 diamino androstane derivatives and their diquaternary or monoquaternary salts. Thus, according to one aspect the present invention provides compounds of formula I and physiologically acceptable diquaternary and monoquaternary salts thereof. Included particularly within the invention are compounds having formulae Ia , Ib , Ic and Id , as follows In the formula I and formula Ia to Id , Y is hydrogen or an _OAc group, Ac is an alkylcarbonyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, A is methylene or a group of the formula In the formula Ia , Ib , Ic and Id , B¹ is a group The activity data are set forth in the following Table in comparison with pancuronium bromide, the best compound disclosed in the United States Patent Specification No. 3,553,212, which exerts its activity according to a non depolariz ing mechanism Negwer 1971 4821 . To determine the time when they begin to exert their activity, the compounds according to the invention were administered in equiactive doses resulting in extremital paralysis in 90 to 100 of the test animals. The tests were carried out on male albino mice, following the method of Pradhan and De Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemoter. 8 399 405 1953 , testing each compound in 4 to 6 different doses on 10 animals each time. The compounds were administered intravenously and the period between the injection and myoparalysis was defined as the onset time. The results show that the effect of the new compounds at the same extent of muscle relaxation developed within a substantially shorter time after administration than that of pancuronium bromide. It is known that the non depolarizing muscle relaxants with a more clear activity profile are preferred in therapy to compounds acting through a depolarizing mechanism. The reason why depolarizing muscle relaxants are widely employed in surgery as initiators of surgical muscle relaxation intubation and at short interventions is that their action develops rapidly after the administration of doses resulting in the desired degree of muscle relaxation. For the hitherto known non depolarizing muscle relaxants the same quick action can be achieved only by relative overdosage, which extends the duration of activity and exposes the patient to an unnecessary drug load. The compounds according to the invention have a satisfactorily early start of action even in minimum therapeutic doses and have a non depolarizing action mechanism, i.e. they inhibit the transmittance of the nervous stimulus on the striated muscle without initial depolarization and muscle twitching. Their effect can be antagonized with acetyl cholineste rase inhibitors, e.g. neostigmine. They have no influence on blood circulation and have no hormonal effect. The new compounds may be synthestized starting from compounds of formula VIII wherein Y is hydrogen or hydroxyl. Certain examples of compounds of formulae VIII and VII are known in the art D.H.R. Barton J. Chem. Soc. From compounds of formula VIII new compounds encompassed by formula VI wherein Y is hydrogen, hydroxyl or an _OAc group, in which Ac is as defined above, X is bromine or an _OAc group, may be prepared via two different reaction routes. The compounds of formula VI , in which both Y and X represents an _OAc group may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIII with the anhydride of an alkanecarboxylic acid having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety or with an alkenyl acetate containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms in the alkenyl moiety, in the presence of an acid, such as sulfuric acid, The compounds of formula IV , in which Y represents hydrogen or hydroxyl and X is bromine may be prepared by convert ing a compound of formula VIII into a compound of the formula VII by reaction whith hydrazine hydrate in presence of a tertiary amine Y is as defined above and transforming the latter compound with N bromo succinimide into a compound of formula VI Y is hydrogen or hydroxyl, X is bromine et a temperature between 0 C and 10 C, in the presence of pyridine. The compounds of formula VI may then be converted into the new diepoxyandrostanes of formula V wherein Y and X are as defined above, by reaction with a peracid preferably perbenzoic acid, The diepoxyandrostanes of formula V may then be reacted with an amine of formula IX wherein A, n and m are as defined above. Depending on the reaction conditions either the new 16 amino androstanes of formula IV or the new 6, 16 diamino androstanes of formula IVa are obtained. In formulae IV and IVa the substituents are as defined above. If a compound of formula V is reacted with an amine of formula IX in the presence of an inert organic solvent, e.g. acetonitrile at room temperature or under boiling for a short time about 2 hours , a 16 monoamino product of formula IV is obtained. If the reaction is performed under heating over a longer period about 100 hours in the presence of water, a 6, 16 diamino product of the formula IVa is obtained. The compounds of formula IV may be converted into the corresponding new compounds of formula II through the compounds of formula III while from the compounds of formula IVa compounds of formula II , which are the starting compounds in the process according to the invention, may be directly obtained. In formula II B is methylene, a group The compounds of the formula IV may be reduced to compounds of formula III with a boron complex, preferably sodium, calcium or trimethoxy borohydride, in an alcoholic medium, and the desired new compounds of formula II may be obtained by reacting the compound of formula III obtained with an amine of formula X The amine of formula X is preferably reacted with the compound of the formula III in the presence of water, at elevated temperature about 100 C . In formulae III and X the substituents have the same meanings as given hereinabove. By reducing the compounds, of formula IVa with a complex metal hydride compound of formula II , in which B A and the other substituents are as defined above, may be obtained. The borohydrides mentioned above may be employed as complex metal hydrides in alcohol but lithium aluminium hydride is equally suitable in an ether type solvent. The compounds of formula II , in which B is an Similarly, from the compounds of formula II , in which B is metylene the monoquaternary salts of formula IIb may be prepared. Quaternization may be carried out by methods known In formulae IIa , IIb and XI the substituents are as defined above. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by acylating compounds of formula II . Alternatively the compounds of formula II , in which B represents an wherein A, Y , R², n and m are as defined above, and then the compounds of formula IIc may be acylated yielding the compounds of formula I . The compounds of formula I may be converted into their diquaternary salts of formula Ia or monoquaternary salts of the formulae Ic or Id by known techniques. The monoquaternary salts of formula Ib may be prepared from the diquaternary salts of formula Ia in an original manner, by adjusting the pH of the reaction mixture to 8.5 to 9. The formation of the desired monoquaternary salts takes place at lower pH as well, but at a slower rate. According to an aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of the new 6, 16 diamino androstane derivatives of formula I and physiological ly acceptable di and monoquaternary salts thereof, having the formulae Ia and Ib , Ic and Id , respectively. In formula I Y is hydrogen or an _OAc group, Ac is alkylcarbonyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, A is methylene or a group The compounds of formula I and their mono and diquaternary salts may be prepared according to the invention either a₁ by reacting a compound of formula II , in which Y is hydrogen or hydroxyl, B is methylene, or In the process according to the invention new compounds of formula II may be used starting materials. The compounds of formula II , in wich B represents an The compounds of the formula IIc and II , respectively are then converted into the corresponding compounds of formula I by acylation. The acylation is desirably carried out with an alkanecarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof capable of acylation. As a derivative capable of acylation generally acid halides or anhydrides are employed, in the presence of an inert organic solvent, preferably a chlorinated hydrocarbon e.g. dichloromethane or an ether type solvent e.g. dioxane . In certain cases the reaction is accomplished in the presence of a tertiary amine, preferably triethyl amine, which serves both as an acid binding agent and a catalyst at the same time, or in the presence of a catalyst preferably 4 dimethyl amino pyridine, alone. The acylation is preferably carried out at room temperature. When the reaction is complete, any excess acylating agent is decomposed and the product is isolated by extraction following evaporation and optionally crystallization. When the acylation is carried out with acetic anhydride, the reaction may also be performed in glacial acetic acid, in the presence of a Lewis acid, e.g. zinc chloride. The compounds of formula I may then be converted into the diguaternary salts of formula Ia or the monoquaternary salts of formula Ic or Id . In the quaternary salts, if A stands for an group, R³ is attached to the nitrogen carrying the R¹ substituent, otherwise to the nitrogen attached to the 16 position. The quaternization is carried out in the presence of an aliphatic ketone or alcohol or methylene chloride. Preferably quaternization is performed in acetone, at room temperature. The monoquaternary salts of formula Ib are prepared from the diquaternary salts of formula Ia . The reaction is carried out in an alkanol having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably methanol or ethanol by adjusting the pH of the solution of the compound of formula Ia to 8.5 to 9, e.g. with sodium hydroxide. The reaction takes place also below pH 8.5 but at a considerably slower rate. Once the solvent is eliminated, the alkali metal halide formed as a by product may be separated by phase exchange, and the compound of formula Ib purified, e.g. by crystalliza tion.
