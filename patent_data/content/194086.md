# Guidance system for a self propelled machine.

## Abstract
An automatic guidance system for a lawn mower com prises four tension cables 10 to 13 each anchorged at a point 15 adjacent one of the corners of a quadrilateral area and each wound round a winch drum 16 to 19 on the mower, a motor 60 on the mower is arranged to drive the four winch drums selectively in pairs, one drum winding in while the other winds out, by means of a common gear ring 63 which is shifted into one of four different driving positions determined by a guide plate 68 in a square opening 70 . The plate is shifted automati cally from one position to the next when the mower ap proaches anyone of the automatically adjustable cleats 20 on the individual cables. The mower thus follows a rectangular path of diminishing size.
