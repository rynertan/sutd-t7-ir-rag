# DEVICE FOR PROJECTING OUT AND SLIDING DOORS OF CABINETS AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
It is described a device for projecting out and sliding doors for furniture and the like which is applicable to a piece of furniture provided with at least a pair of doors. The device in question allows to place the doors of the piece of furniture staggered over two parallel planes when they are to slide one above the other for the opening of the piece of furniture and to place the same onto the same plane when the piece of furniture is closed. Passage from one condition to the other takes place by such a displacement of the door provided with this device, which is normal to the direction of sliding of the door itself and more precisely it is a jutting out displacement with respect to the piece of furniture for bringing the doors to their staggered condition and a displacement towards the piece of furniture for bringing back the doors to the aligned condition.

## Description
The present invention concerns a device for projecting out and sliding doors of cabinets and the like. It is known that, generally, in cabinets provided with at least a pair of doors, the latter slide along suitable guides of the cabinet for allowing opening and closing of the same and they are staggered between themselves on substantially parallel planes. When the cabinet is closed such doors remain in the staggered condition and this causes inconveniences concerning both the aesthetic of the piece of furniture as well as its performance. The staggered position of the doors is particularly disadvantageous because in such a condition at least one of them is not perfectly in contact with the frame of the piece of furniture henceforth it may easily happens that dust gets into the cabinet. The piece of furniture thence no longer performs one of its main tasks that are attributed to it and which consists in containing, isolating it from the outside, the material housed therein. With the aim of eliminating the inconveniences herein above, more complex arrangements have been proposed which allow one of the doors to bring itself back in alignment with the other when the cabinet is closed, all doors lying, therefore, on the same plane and thence resulting in contact with the frame of the cabinet. A first solution among the above mentioned arrangements provides, to that aim, for at least one of the guides for the sliding movement of the doors to be retractable by provision of a hinge. With the word retractable it is intended that the guide concerned, and therefore the door connected to it, may shift in a direction orthogonal to that of sliding to move toward the cabinet so that the guide concerned places itself, when the cabinet is closed, on the same plane of the other door. The reverse movement takes place when the cabinet must be opened so that the door is projected out or jutted out thanks, in fact, to the possibility of projecting out the relative guide. Nevertheless such an arrangement, though obtaining the aim for which it has been devised, has an extremely high cost because it is composed of a rather complex mechanism. Furthermore such an arrangement implies long assembly times because the assembly of the device is rather complicated. It is to be noted further that this solution requires specialized workmen for the assembly of the device, thus being unsuitable to be assembled by the user himself as frequently happens in the do it yourself field. A second known arrangement, which has the same effects of the first one, provides for at least one of the doors of the cabinet to be able to be projected out and retracted in the direction indicated above, thence moving along two orthogonal directions thanks to the presence of a carriage with bearings provided generally at the lower edge of the door. The arrangement just recalled substantially presents the same inconveniences of the first one so that tendentially it is seldom adopted also in consideration of the fact that, as for the first arrangement recalled, its high cost has a high incidence upon the final cost of the piece of furniture. It has now been conceived, and forms the object of the present invention, a device suitable to allow the projecting out and the retraction of at least one door in a cabinet or the like and which is capable of eliminating the above mentioned inconveniences. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a device of the kind described which is of extremely simple construction and thence inexpensive and may therefore be easily assembled. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a device for projecting out and sliding doors of cabinets and the like which does not require peculiar supplementary elements such as the traditional devices for allowing the projecting out and the retraction of a door but, by virtue of its extremely simple construction, may be also adapted to traditional pieces of furniture wherein normally doors remain staggered on parallel planes also when the piece of furniture is closed. The characteristics as well as the advantages of the device according to the present invention will become clear through the following detailed description of a non limitative embodiment thereof, with reference to the annexed figures wherein With particular reference to Fig. 1, the device according to the invention is associated with a door 1 of a piece of furniture or cabinet represented with a dashed line. The device is composed of a top portion indicated altogether with 2 associated with the upper edge of the door 1 and of a lower portion indicated altogether with 3 associated with the lower edge of the door1. Hereinbelow will be described firstly the top portion 2 of the device also with reference to Figs. 2, and 5 to 7. The top portion 2 of the device comprises a structural member 4, preferably of metal, which is substantially shaped as a U channel with the concavity directed downwards and having one side longer than the other. It is seen that side 4a, which is fixed by screws 5 to the top edge of the door 1, is longer than the other side 4b. The latter, in particular, as more clearly shown in Figs. 5 and 6, is not parallel to the first side 4a but it is slanted toward the outside of said U channel, thus forming an obtuse angle with the base thereof. To the U shaped member 4 of the top portion 2 of the device an element is associated, movable with respect to said member, composed essentially of an elongated plate 6 of a length substantially equal to that of the U shaped member 4. The elongated plate 6 has, on its top edge, projections 7, three in the embodiment shown, which are inserted in corresponding slits 8 of one of the two corners of the U shaped member 4, precisely of the cabinet side corner. In Figs. 5 and 6 together with the baseboard 11 of the cabinet also the top wall 9 and the lower wall 10 thereof are illustrated. The projections 7 of the elongated plate 6 are inserted into the slits 8 of member 4 with a certain clearance so that the elongated plate 6 may swing with respect to the member 4 to be able to move between the two working positions shown, respectively, in Fig. 5 wherein the elongated plate 6 is substantially parallel to the side 4a of the member 4 and the position of Fig. 6 wherein the elongated plate 6 is slanted towards the interior of the member 4 itself. To this end the width of slits 8 of the member 4 shall be slightly greater than the thickness of the projections 7 thus permitting the swinging movement indicated above. Substantially at the ends of the elongated plate 6, provision is made for mounting to two running small wheels 12 which can freely rotate on a pin 13 fixed to said plate and extending perpendicularly to it. Small wheels 12 allow sliding of the door 1 in because, as shown in particular in Figs. 5 and 6, they run on a rectilinear rail 14 provided onto a L shaped member 15 fixed on the top surface of the top wall 9 of the cabinet in correspondence of its front edge. Elongated plate 6 is connected to slide 4b of the member 4 by spring means in a manner specified hereinbelow. As it is more clearly shown in Figs. 1 and 2 but also in Figs. 5 to 7, a pair of elastic coupling means is provided, each one indicated altogether with 16, between the elongated plate 6 and the member 4. Each of the elastic coupling means 16 comprises a small rod 17, which slidable within a small block 18 pivotedly mounted on a pin 19 Fig. 7 which extends crosswise between two tabs 20 provided on side 4b of the member 4 and projecting outside therefrom. One end of the small rod 17, precisely the lower end with reference to the above mentioned figures, is pivoted on a cross member 21 which bridges across two tabs 22 of the elongated plate 6, both projecting from the same side as tabs 20. About the small rod 17 a pair of springs are positioned, and more precisely a first spring 23, placed above pin 18, which is kept in tension thanks to a nut 24 screwed down to the threaded top end of the small rod 17. The first spring 23, therefore, engages with its ends said nut 24 on one side and, aid small block 18 on the other side. A second spring 25 is also provided which is kept in tension thanks to a nut 26 and therefore engages itself, at one of its ends, with said nut and at the other with said small block 18. The two spring assemblies 16 are substantially similar and therefore the above description above is substantially valid for both. The only difference resides in that the elastic constant of the two springs 23 and 25 is different and, in particular, making reference to Fig. 2 and to the spring assembly on the left, the top spring 23 is stiffer than the bottom spring 25. In the elastic assembly on the right the springs are placed in an inverted order that is the bottom spring therefore indicated with 23 is more rigid than the top spring therefore indicated with 25 . The bottom portion 3 of the device according to the present invention will now be described making reference, in particular, to Figs. 1, 3 and 4. Portion 3 comprises a first structural member 27, preferably of metal, which has substantially an L shape. One of its sides, the vertical one of Fig. 1, is fixed by screws 28 to the lower edge of door 1 while the other side, perpendicular to the first, projects from the surface of door 1 on the side towards the cabinet. The lower portion 3 of the device comprises a second structural member 29, which extends substantially parallel with respect to the first one and has a length similar thereto. The second member 29 has one side opposing the horizontal side of the first member 27 and the other side extending vertically downwards. Substantially at the ends of the second member 29, on its horizontal side, there is provided a pair of small wheels 30, which as it appears in particular from Figs. 5 and 6 may run inside a U shaped guide 31 which is fixed underneath the bottom surface 10 of the piece of furniture. The two members 27 and 29 forming the lower portion 3 of the device are connected each other by a pair of pantographs, each of which is indicated altogether with 32. Each one of the pantograph assemblies 32 comprises a couple of small rods 33 which are reciprocally pivoted in correspondence of a central portion thereof by means of a pin 34. Small rods 33 are also pivoted, at one of their ends, to members 27 and 29 by means of a pin 35 while, at their other end they are pivoted by means of a pin 36 again to members 27 and 29. In this instance, are not only pivotedly mounted on said members but they may also slide with respect to such members and, to this end, pins 36 are made slidable into a slot 37 in members 27 and 29. A spring 38 connects pins 34 and is provided, in a known manner, with a device 39 for adjustment of its tension. Spring 38 is provided for favouring the operation of separation of the two members 27 and 29 and therefore the shifting of door 1 moving away from the cabinet passing from the position of Fig. 6 to that of Fig. 5. The action of spring 38 is, in fact, that of bringing pins 34 nearer thus favouring the opening of the pantographs 32. In the embodiment considered, the piece of furniture is provided with a pair od doors. The second door, shown with 40, is supported in a known manner by the cabinet as it is shown in particular in Figs. 5 and 6. On the top edge of door 40 there is a plurality of pins 41 only one of which is visible in the cited figures , on each one of which is rotatably mounted a small wheel 42 which allows sliding of the door 40 on a slide rail 43 provided on the same elongated member 15 of rail 14 and parallel thereto. A L shaped structural member 45 is fixed, by screws 44, to the lower edge of the door 40 and on its horizontal side can freely rotate small wheels 46 only one of which is visible in the cited figures which may run inside a U shaped guide 47 integrally formed with guide 31 into which the small wheels 30 of the other door 1 run. From what disclosed above, it is evident that the second door 40 may perform only one movement of sliding, always on the same plane which is the one perpendicular to the plane of Figs. 5 and 6. On the contrary, the first door 1 may perform, in addition to such a movement, a further displacement in both directions on a plane perpendicular to the previously mentioned one, that is the one of Figs. 5 and 6 to move from the condition of Fig. 5, wherein the door 1 is staggered with respect to, and on a plane parallel to that of the second door 40, to the position of Fig. 6, wherein the first door 1 is on the same plane of the second door 40 and vicecersa. This additional movement is allowed by the device according to the invention with which is supplied the door and the operation of which is briefly described hereinbelow. It is assumed to start from the condition of Fig. 5, when the cabinet is open and the two doors lay on parallel planes. The wheels 12, which support from the top the first door 1, as well as the elongated plate 6, are substantially perpendicular to the plane of rail 14. In other words, wheels 12 are parallel to wheels 42 which support the second door 40. The springs 23 and 25 of rod 17 are not stressed in this instance because the weight of door 1 discharges, through member 4, directly on the elongated plate 6 and thence on wheels 12. Such springs, therefore, are in a rest condition. In the condition now considered, the pantographs 32, positioned under the door 1, are open as it is shown in Fig. 5. It is desired to close the cabinet, firstly door 1 will be caused to slide in a parallel direction to door 40 until they are substantially juxtaposed but still lying on parallel planes. At this point it is sufficient to exert a pushing action on the door 1 towards the cabinet and, thanks to the device according to the invention, the door 1 shall be able to be brought on the same plane of the door 40 as shown in Fig. 6. The above mentioned movement is permitted because wheels 12, which support door 1, are carried by an inclinable portion formed of the elongated plate 6 and such a portion is connected to member 4 which supports door 1 by means of the spring assemblies 16. When the door 1 is pushed towards the cabinet, wheels 12, not being able to leave the associate guiding rail 14, become slanted as it is shown in Fig. 6 thanks to the capability of the elongated plate 6 to be inclined. Such an inclination of the elongated plate 6 with respect to the member 4 is allowed by the fact that the slots 8 in said member accomodate the projections 7 of the elongated plate 6 with a certain clearance, in particular the width of said slots 8 is slightly larger than the thickness of the projections 7. As a consequence of the inclination of the elongated plate 6 towards the interior of the member 4, a corresponding inclination of rods 17, pivotally connected to said elongated plate 6, will take place and the rods 17 will assume the position as it is illustrated in Fig. 6. In this condition the rods 17 will slide slightly inside blocks 18 and springs 23 and 25 between said small block and the adjustment nut 24 will be compressed. Simultaneously to the above described positioning of the top portion of the device, closing of the pantographs 32 shall take place in the lower portion thereof. In order to open again the cabinet, that is to bring back the first door 1 in the position of Fig. 5, it will be sufficient to perform the operations described above in an opposite direction. To perform this operation, the door 1 shall be provided, on its visible surface, with suitable grasping implements such as handles or the like, possibly of the recessed type.
