# SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY

## Abstract
In a semiconductor memory made up of semiconductor memory elements, each consisting of a transistor of an MOS structure which has a charge storage layer and which is formed on a semiconductor substrate, the improvement wherein a switching element is provided so that positive or negative charge can be stored in discharged from the charge storage layer in a mode for writing data, and the charge storage layer can be allowed to float electrically when in a mode for reading data.
