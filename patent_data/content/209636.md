## Claims
1. A process for the preparation of a chiral aromatic cynohydrin or a mixture enantiomerically enriched therein which com prises treating an aromatic aldehyde in an inert, aprotic solvent with hydrogen cyanide or a generator thereof in the presence of a cyclo D phenylalanyl D histidine or a cyclo L phenylalanyl L histi dine dipeptide catalyst and pretreating the aldehyde or solution thereof in the solvent to remove catalyst poisons or impurities which adversely affect enantiomeric selectivity.

## Description
Asymmetric synthesis of R mandelonitrile by addition of hydro gen cyanide to benzaldehyde in the presence of a synthetic dipeptide catalyst is known in the art, as in Oku, Jun ichi and Shohei Inoue, The present invention is directed to a process of preparing a chiral aromatic cyanohydrin optically active alpha hydroxynitrile or a mixture enantiomerically enriched therein which comprises treating a aromatic aldehyde with hydrogen cyanide or a generator thereof in the presence of an inert, aprotic solvent, a cyclo D phenylalanyl D histidine or cyclo L phenylalanyl L histidine dipeptide as a catalyst and pre treating the aldehyde or solution thereof in the solvent to remove catalyst poisons or impurities that adversely affect enantiomeric Such treatment is particularly important when the catalyst, solvent streams, or a minor amount of product chiral cyanohydrin is recycled in either a continuous or batch chiral cyanohydrination process because poisons or other adverse impurities would otherwise continue to build up in the reaction system resulting in a continued decline in enantiomeric selectivity over the time of operation of the process. Removal of the undesirable materials in the aldehyde feed results in increased enantiomeric selectivity and the prevention of significant decline thereof over the operation of the process, particularly when using recycled catalyst, solvent or product of chiral cyanohydrination. Basic nitrogen compounds were found to be poisonous to and or competitive with the chiral cyclo phenylalanyl histidine catalyst used in chiral cyanohydrination resulting in reduced enantiomeric selectivity. Amines are the chief basic nitrogen compounds which may be present in the aldehyde reactant. Carboxylic acids also are undesirable materials, particularly when basic nitrogen compounds, such as amines are also present. Thus, the process of the present invention includes treating the aldehyde, or a solution thereof, in a solvent to remove catalyst poisons or impurities that adversely effect enaniomeric selectivity, such as amines and optionally carboxylic acids. Residual amines are readily removed by treating the aldehyde or a solution thereof with an acid or acidic acting material, which will neutralize and, preferably, remove the amines in an aldehyde reactant of the process. Suitable acid or acidic acting materials include those materials having strong acidity and being essentially insoluble in the organic phase being treated, acidic clays, such as acidic silicates, aluminates or synthetic acidified clays, acidic cation exchange resins, e.g., sulfonic acid cation exchange resins, including of the Dowex and Amberlite types, and mineral acids, such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids. Since carboxylic acid impurities are a problem, particularly in the presence of basic nitrogen compounds, such as amines, it can be desirable to treat the aldehyde or a solution thereof with a base or basic acting substance, which will neutralize and, preferably, remove the carboxylic acid impurities in the aldehyde of the process. Suitable bases or basic acting materials, including the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides. Examples of such alkaline materials include the following hydroxyides sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, and the like. A source of alkalinity basic acting substance can also comprise the various anion exchange resins which are charged with soluble anions such as halides, e.g., chloride, bromide, fluoride, nitrate, sulfate, and the like, Examples of suitable base exchange resins are amination products of chloromethylated styrene divinylbenzene copolymers marketed by Rohm Hass as Amberlite IRA 400 and IRA 401 made by reacting formaldehyde, melamine and diethylenetriamine resins having quaternary ammonium groups linked to polystyrene that has been cross linked with divinyl benzene marketed by Dow Chemical Company as Dowex 1 and Dowex 2 , and resins having polyalkylamine groups linked to a polystyrenedivinyl benzene matrix marketed by Dow Chemical Company as Dowex 3 . Some treatments, including use of a high vacuum spinning distillation band column, adsorption, and the like, can remove the amines, and acids. For example, Florisil magnesium silicate , molec ular sieves and other similar conventional adsorbents are useful. It may be advantageous to treat the aldehyde or a solution thereof with more than one of the above kinds of materials in series or to treat the aldehyde or a solution thereof successively with the same kind of material for optional removal of catalyst poisons or other detrimental impurities that adversly effect enantiomeric selectivity in this chiral cyanohydrination process. The amount of treating agent used is dependent on the amount of undesirable material s present in the aldehyde feed and is conven tionally determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of chiral aromatic cyanohydrins optically active alpha hydroxynitriles or a mixture enantiomerically enriched therein which comprises treating the corresponding aldehyde with a source of hydrogen cyanide in a substantially water immiscible, aprotic solvent and in the presence of a cyclo D phenylalanyl D histidine or cyclo L phenylalanyl L histidine dipeptide as a catalyst and the step of pretreating the aldehyde or a solution thereof in the solvent to remove catalyst poisons or impurities that adversly effect enantiomeric selectivity. These products of formula I are then optically active optionally substituted alpha cyano alcohols or a mixture enantiomerically enriched in such an alcohol. The chiral aromatic cyanohydrin products include those of formula I In one embodiment, the alpha hydroxynitrile has the formula II Preferably, the optically active alpha hydroxynitrile products have the alpha S configuration when derived from aldehydes and, therefore, include S alpha hydroxynitriles of the formula III Non limiting examples of alpha hydroxynitriles of the formula I include S alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol, S alpha cyano 4 fluoro 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol, S alpha cyano 3 4 fluorophenoxy benzyl alcohol, and the like In another embodiment of the process, the chiral cyanohydrin has the formula IV A further embodiment of the invention is directed to a process for increasing enantiomeric selectivity in chiral cyanohydrination of an aromatic aldehyde with hydrogen cyanide or a generator thereof in the presence of an inert, aprotic solvent and a chiral cyclo phenylalanyl histidine catalyst, which process comprises the step of pretreating the aldehyde to remove catalyst poisons or impurities that adversely effect chiral selectivity. A substantially water immiscible, aprotic solvent for use in this invention is defined as an aprotic solvent in which the solubility in water is not more than 5 v, at the reaction temperature and does not interfere with the reaction . For example, the solvent is a hydro carbon, or ether solvent including acyclic, alicyclic or aromatic materials. For example, suitable solvents are alkanes containing from 5 to 10 carbon atoms such as n pentane, n hexane, n heptane, n octane, n nonane, n decane and their isomers. Petroleum fractions rich in alkanes are also suitable, for example, gasoline with boiling range at atmospheric pressure of between 40 and 65 C, between 60 and 80 C or between 80 and 110 C. Petroleum ether is also suitable. Cyclohexane and methylcyclohexanes are examples of useful cycloalkanes containing from 6 to 8 carbon atoms. Aromatic hydrocarbon solvents can contain from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, for example, benzene, toluene, o , m and p xylene, the trimethylbenzenes, p ethyltoluene and the like. Useful ethers include diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl t butyl ether and the like. Preferably, the solvent has a boiling point below about 150 C. Preferably, the solvent is an aromatic hydrocarbon, especially toluene, diisopropyl ether or diethyl ether or mixtures thereof e.g. 25 75 of diethyl ether toluene . Toluene gives especially high enan tiomeric excess when the substrate is 3 phenoxybenzaldehyde. Advantages of diethyl ether are the higher rate of reaction and that the catalyst is not soluble and can be recovered as a solid at the end of the reaction. The amount of catalyst can vary. For example, it can be used in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 mole percent based upon the weight of the aldehyde present, especially about 1.0 to about 7.5 mole percent. The catalyst is preferably well dispersed in the reaction mixture. The aromatic aldehyde reactant corresponds to the desired chiral cyanohydrin product, e.g., of formulas I, II, III or IV and preferably, is an aldehyde reactant of the formula V The source of cyanide is hydrogen cyanide or an agent that generates hydrogen cyanide, under the reaction condition. Hydrogen cyanide itself is preferred. The molar ratio of hydrogen cyanide to aldehyde is from about 1.0 to about 3.0 moles per mole of aldehyde and, preferably, from about 1.1 to about 2.0. One embodiment of the present process is directed to use of a catalyst for cyanohydrination of aldehydes, comprising a solid chiral cyclo phenylalanylhistidine having a substantially noncrystalline component as disclosed in co pending U.S. Serial No. 535,500, filed September 26, 1983 and its subsequent divisional applications, and U.S. Serial No. 551, 548, filed November 14, 1983 as a continuation in part of and also described below. The addition of some recycle chiral cyano hydrin product or other alcohol to the feed in chiral cyanohydrination is claimed in concurrently filed U.S. patent application 749,618, filed June 26, 1985. The catalyst can have a substantially amorphous or non crystalline form. While the precise form of this cyclo D phenylalanyl D histidine or cyclo L phenylalanyl L histidine dipeptide is not known, it appears that the activated amorphous or non crystalline form precipitated with a random structure and with a number of the available NH groups in the dipeptide free of intermolecular hydrogen bonding to the available C 0 groups as compared with the less active crystalline component form where the molecules had time to orient themselves as they were laid down into a highly bonded orderly structure. Such being the case, the degree of amorphousness or non crystallinity is most readily determined by X ray diffraction. The wide angle X ray scattering WAXS measurements were carried out in reflection by means of a Philips APD3600 02 automated X ray diffractometer. The samples were scanned at 20 C in air from 5.0 to 60.0 2ϑ at 0.02 degree increments, and 0.6 second time incre ments with Cu Kα radiation 40KV, 35 ma . The percent crystallinity was determined by a modified Hermans and Weidinger method P. H. Hermans and A. Weidinger, As used herein the terms amorphous or non crystalline define active catalyst materials that have about 45 or more of an amorphous or non crystalline component as determined by the area of the X ray diffraction spectra obtained by the method described above. Preferably, the amorphous or non crystalline component of the materials as defined by the X ray diffraction spectra is about 45 to about 65 or higher. Preferably, the amorphous or non crystalline The catalysts are also analyzable by photomicrographs in which inefficient catalysts consist of agglomerates of fine crystallites. Crystallites are not evident in photomicrographs of active catalysts, which when, for example, are spray dried, take the form of hollow appearing spheres. Alternative methods to define amorphous and non crystalline character are infrared or nuclear magnetic resonance spectral studies or observation of swelling of the material, e.g. in contact with the reactants of the cyanohydrination process. Such amorphous or non crystalline catalysts and their preparation are also described in European patent 135,691 and U.S. patent 4,554,102. The reaction to prepare alpha hydroxynitriles is suitably conducted by adding the aldehyde and solvent to the chiral cyclo phenyl alanyl histidine catalyst, dispersing mechanical grinding or agitating the mixture e.g. by stirring , adding hydrogen cyanide and maintaining the reaction conditions for an amount of time to effect the formation of the optically active alpha hydroxynitrile. That is, preferably, the hydrogen cyanide is introduced concurrently with or subsequent to the solvent and or aldehyde to increase the conversion and stereoselectivity. The presence of cyanide ions appears to have an adverse effect on the catalyst in this reaction. The forming and maintaining of a well dispersed but not necessarily homogeneous like reaction mixture are useful. Separation and recovery of the optically active ester product are achieved by conventional techniques, including extraction and the like. The temperature of the reaction to prepare the optically active alpha hydroxynitriles as well as the pressure can vary. At normal pressures, the temperature is from about 10 C to about 80 C, more or less. Preferably, ambient temperatures of about 5 C to about 35 C are convenient to give good yield, rate or reaction and enantiomeric excess of the desired optically active product, the lower temperature of about 5 C giving good results. The alpha hydroxynitriles and their corresponding aldehydes are generally known in the literature. The S benzyl alcohols are of interest per se or as intermediates to esters, e.g. of the pyrethroid type, for example, S alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol in U.S. patent 4,273,727. The S alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol or mixture enriched therein of the invention, is treated with a carboxylic acid halide, e.g., an S alpha isopropylphenylacetic acid chloride or an optionally substituted chiral cyclopropanecaraboxylic acid chloride, to give an optically active cyanomethyl ester or a mixture enriched therein. The cyanomethyl esters for which the optically active form is prepared from one of more chiral cyanohydrins of the process of the invention, have e.g. the formula VI The following embodiments are provided for the purpose of ilustrating the invention and should not be regarded as limiting it in any way. The identity of the products was confirmed by infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral analyses. Acid treatments of 3 phenoxybenzaldehyde POAL were con ducted as described below. The treated 3 phenoxybenzaldehyde was then subjected to chiral cyanohydrination by treating a 20.6 w solution of the aldehyde in toluene with hydrogen cyanide in the presence of cyclo D phen ylalanyl D histidine catalyst. Results of the chiral cyanohydrina tion to produce S alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol are set forth in Table1 below. A solution of 20.6 w of 3 phenoxybenzaldehyde in toluene was treated with dilute sulfuric acid at a ratio of 30 1 organic phase to acid phase. The resulting mixture was vigorously agitated and then centrifuged to effect clean phase separation to remove basic nitrogen compounds, including amines, in the acid fraction. Results of chiral cyanohydrination with 3 phenoxybenzaldehyde showing the effect of reduced total basic nitrogen in cyclo D phenylalanyl D histidine catalyst are set forth in Table 2 below.
