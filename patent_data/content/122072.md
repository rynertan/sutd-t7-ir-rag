# Gas filled dot matrix display panel and operating system.

## Abstract
A display panel comprising a matrix of D.C. scan cells arrayed in rows and colums and a matrix of A.C. display cells arrayed in rows and colums, each scan cell being in operative relation with two display cells so that for every column of scan cells there are two sets of display cells. The panel also includes two sets of sustainer electrodes associated with the two sets of display cells and properly operated by complementary oppo sitely phased sustaining signals in conjunction with the scan cells to select and turn on desired display cells, column by column. Also disclosed is a circuit for generating the two op positely phased sustainer signals for the two sets of sustainer electrodes.
