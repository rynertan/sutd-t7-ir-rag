# An internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine of the piston and cylinder type is provided. The conventional cylinder head is replaced by a detachable head assembled from two hollowed out cylinder head components one of which 3a is shown. The components when assembled provide a cavity 4 which is contoured so as to accommodate in gas tight sealing with the walls thereof a rotor 5 having a pair of drums 7, 8 thereon, each drum 7, 8 has a rotor passage 7a, 8a thereon so that when the rotor 5 is rotated in a conventional manner , the rotor passages 7a, 8a provide an uninter rupted conduit between the carburettor and the cylinder or the cylinder and the exhaust manifold during the induction stroke and the exhaust stroke respectively of the piston of one cylinder of the engine. Four pairs of drums are provided on the same rotor for use in a four cylinder, four stroke engine. Each drum 7, 8 has a spherical section 130 defined by two parallel planes 131, 132 of a sphere the planes being disposed symmetrically about the centre of the sphere, and the intersection between the planes and the spherical section being rounded off.
