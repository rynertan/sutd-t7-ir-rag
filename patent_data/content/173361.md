# Organic compounds for use in a dye diffusion transfer process and photographic elements incorporating them.

## Abstract
A non diffusing compound capable of releasing a diffusible mono azo dye or dye precursor thereof from a carrier moiety, said compound corresponding to the following general formula I I CAR L G D wherein CAR represents a ballasted carrier moiety, L represents a chemical group cleavable or releasable from the carrier moiety as a function of redox reaction or argen tolytic reaction taking place in the development of a silver halide emulsion layer under alkaline conditions, G represents a bivalent organic group incorporating at least three aromatic nuclei, selected from the group consisting of homocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic nuclei, with the provi sions that L is linked to one end nucleus and that D is linked to the other end nucleus of said bivalent organic group said linking being by means of a direct bond or by means of a bivalent mono or polyatomic group, and D is an azo dye part linked to said other end aromatic nucleus of G.
