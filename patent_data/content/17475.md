# Acoustic flowmeter with Reynolds number compensation.

## Abstract
An acoustic flowmeter wherein pulses of acoustic ener gy are transmitted between upstream and downstream transducers through the field under measurement and wherein the arithmetic computation of the velocity based upon the difference in time measurement of the oppositely directed pulses is modified by predetermined factors to automatically compensate for errors caused by a Reynolds number change due to flow velocity change.
