## Description
The present invention relates to a display apparatus in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 and having a function of vertical smooth scrolling in a part of the area of a CRT screen. Heretofore, a method for displaying different data groups such as characters on a plurality of divided areas of the screen in a CRT display devices has been known. Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 54 105435 discloses a display device having a partial vertical scrolling function to shift characters vertically only in specific area while keeping characters still in other areas. However, the shifting unit on scrolling is a character line, and the smooth scrolling function to shift characters by the unit of dot is not provided. EP A 0 059 349 describes a display device segmented into multiple scrolling regions. A microprocessor controls the system operation in accordance with a list of instructions stored in a random access main memory. The main memory stores a portion of the list of instructions, while the complete list of instructions is stored in a mass data storage memory in the form of one or more GROMs. An additional ROM contains a list of instructions for initializing the system and a nonvolatile memory in the form of a CMOS RAM powered by a battery to store system configuration parameters in the event of a power loss. This known display system is quite complicated and sophisticated and furthermore restricted to fixed scrolling areas and thus not very flexible. On the other hand, the display control method disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 49 90459 establishes static and dynamic areas on a screen, and shifts characters by the unit of dot within the dynamic area. The possibility of shifting not only in the horizontal direction but also in the vertical direction is suggested. However, these two types of areas are fixed and cannot be established flexibly, and two separate memories are required to be assigned to the two areas. In Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 58 207077, a display device for performing the vertical smooth scrolling by sequentially changing the content of a current raster counter to control read out of the character generator is disclosed. However, this device shifts characters in the whole area of the screen, and has no function to shift only characters in a specific area. As described above, prior art has been known to enable vertical smooth scrolling only in a part of the screen, but the establishment of areas and the assignment of memories are fixed and there is no flexibility. It is the object of the present invention to overcome these drawbacks. The invention as laid down in the claims overcomes these problems in advantageous manner. The display apparatus in accordance with the invention has a means for holding control information to define a display column range and a display row range of an area on a screen subjected to the vertical smooth scrolling and a means for holding offset data indicating a vertical shift amount of the vertical smooth scrolling, and the control information and offset data can be changed suitably by a control means. It is also provided with a means for generating a smooth scroll area signal based on said control information and a means for modifying a line count output of a line counter in synchronism with the scanning of the screen during the generation of the smooth scroll area signal. Thus, in the scroll area, the modified line count output cooperates with a character code to read a series of bits corresponding to a horizontal part of a corresponding character pattern out of a character generator and supplies it to the CRT display circuit. Further, in an address device for reading the character code out of a storage device, a row counter for the scroll area and a row counter for the other area are provided to enable the reading of character codes to be displayed on display rows indicated by row counts of these row counters. In the following the invention is described in more detail by way of example shown in the embodiment of the drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows the configuration of an embodiment of the display apparatus according to this invention. As shown in Fig. 1, this display apparatus comprises a CRT 1 as display device, a video signal control and timing circuit 2, a character generator 3, a refresh RAM 4, an address circuit 5, a line count circuit 6, a smooth scroll S S control circuit 7 and a microprocessor MPU 99. The microprocessor 99 performs overall control for display such as the arrangement of data to be displayed. The CRT 1 has a screen to display characters including symbols of, for example, 24 lines x 80 rows. The refresh RAM 4 consists of a start address SA table 41, a line attribute LA table 42 and a buffer memory 43, and stores various information written by the MPU 99 at need. Referring to Fig. 2, the relation between the information stored in the SA table 41, LA table 42 and buffer memory 43 will be described. In Fig. 2, examples of the contents of the tables and memory are shown in relation to 25 rows identified by row counts from 0 to 24. The reason why data for 25 rows are required for 24 display rows defined on the screen is that it is necessary on scrolling to display partially data for an additional row. The buffer memory 43 stores a plurality of character codes indicating characters to be displayed. In this embodiment, characters corresponding to codes A, B ... shown in portion 1 of the buffer memory 43 are displayed in the first line of the screen, and those corresponding to J, K ... are displayed in the second line. When the displaying is performed on the left and right areas of the screen, i.e. the first partition and the second partition, then characters corresponding to codes in portion 1 are displayed on the first partition, for example, while codes a, b, ... j, k in portion 2 are displayed on the second partition. The LA table 42 stores line attributes LA0, LA1 ... LA24 assigned to each row as information to control the display pattern of each row. Line attributes also contain control information for the vertical smooth scrolling. Details will be described later. The SA table 41 consists of a portion 1 for the first partition and a portion 2 for the second partition. Each portion stores addresses of storage locations in the buffer memory 43 which stores the codes of the characters to be displayed at the start of successive rows in each partition. This address is called the start address. Start addresses P0, P1 ... P24 are addresses of storage locations for codes A, J ... X in the buffer memory 43, and start addresses Q0, Q1 ... Q24 are addresses of storage locations for codes a, j ... x. As described later in detail, the start address is transmitted to a display address counter 52 through a register 51 and a gate 90 in the address circuit 5, and used for reading a code out of the buffer memory 43. The read code is transmitted to the character generator 3. Character generator 3 also receives a line count generated by the line count circuit 6 on a line 86 at the same time, and as is well known, supplies a plurality of bits corresponding to a horizontal part of a character pattern to a parallel serial converter 21 in the circuit 2 in parallel. For example, if the character pattern consists of 16 x 8 bits dots , 8 bits corresponding to the line count are taken out. The parallel serial converter 21 transmits the 8 bits to the CRT 1 serially in synchronism with a clock signal generated by a clock circuit 22 to display them on a certain scanning line. The clock signal is also supplied to a character width counter 23. This counter divides the frequency of the clock signal by eight to generate a character clock signal indicating the display timing of successive characters a the line 89. The video signal control and timing circuit 2 and the character generator 3 containing such entities are well known. Next, the details of the address circuit 5 will be described. As is shown in Fig. 1, this circuit comprises a start address register 51, a display address counter 52, a jump scroll J S area row counter 53, a smooth scroll S S area row counter 54, a column counter 55, selectors 56 and 57, an adder 58 and a control signal generator 59. The selector 57 gates selectively either the output of display address counter 52 or of adder 58, depending on control signals on the line 81. Similarly, the selector 56 gates selectively either the output of the J S area row counter 53 or of the S S area row counter 54, depending on control signals on the line 83. The details of the generation of these control signals on lines 81 and 83, and the operation timing of the selectors 56 and 57 will be described later. The column counter 55 indicates the column counts determining the display time of successive characters and display locations on the screen in accordance with the character clock signal generated by the character width counter 23 on the line 89. In this embodiment, the column counter 55 operates so as to repeat column counts from 0 to 99. Column counts from 0 to 79 correspond to the display range in the horizontal direction column counts from 80 to 99 correspond to the display prohibition range horizontal retrace time in the horizontal direction of the CRT 1. The column counter 55 generates a pulse on a line 84 each time the column count reaches 99, thereby incrementing a line counter 61 in the line count circuit 6. The line counter 61 indicates line counts from 0 to 15 corresponding to 16 scanning lines for each display row, and generates a signal on the line 85 to become a high level each time the line count reaches 15. This signal is supplied to the J S area row counter 53 and a controller 71 in the S S control circuit 7. The J S area row counter 53 counts each time the signal on the line 85 changes from a high level to a low level and generates row counts from 0 to 26 repeatedly. Row counts 0 to 23 correspond to 1st to 24th display lines of the vertical display range row counts 24 to 26 correspond to the display prohibition range vertical retrace time in the vertical direction. The J S area row counter 53 is used when the displaying is performed on the left and right partitions of the screen to indicate row counts for the partition not subjected to the smooth scrolling. On the other hand, the S S area row counter 54 is used to indicate row counts for the partition subjected to the smooth scrolling. For this purpose, the S S area row counter 54 does not count in accordance with the signal generated by the line counter 61 on the line 85, but counts in accordance with a signal generated by the controller 71 in the S S control circuit 7 on the line 88, as described later. The reason why the S S area row counter 54 is used besides the J S area row counter 53 is that, in the scroll partition, a row count different from that for the non scroll partition is required because a boundary between adjacent rows may appear on a certain scanning line other than the first and last scanning lines of a display row. The row count of the J S area row counter 53 or the S S area row counter 54 selected by the selector 56 and the column count of the column counter 55 are added by the adder 58 to be used as the address for taking out the start address from the SA table 41 see Fig. 2 and as the address for taking out the line attribute from the LA Table 42. When the screen is divided into two partitions, the start address P0, P1 etc. for the first partition is loaded in the display address counter 52 through the register 51, then the start address Q Q0, Q1 etc. for the second partition is loaded in the register 51. Thus, it is ready to transfer Q from the register 51 to the display address counter 52 when passing out of the first partition to the second partition. Referring now to Figs. 1 and 4, the operation timing of the address circuit 5 will be described. In Fig. 4 is shown an example in which the screen is divided at the boundary of column counts 33 and 34, and the vertical smooth scrolling is allowed in the second partition. The control signal generator 59 is connected to the column counter 55 and the S S control circuit 7 in Fig. 1, the connecting lines are omitted , and generates the control signals on lines 81, 82 and 83 based on the signals from them. The signal on the line 81 is a simple signal which is of a high level when the column counts are from 0 to 79 indicating the horizontal display range , and of a low level when the column counts are from 80 to 99 indicating the horizontal display prohibition range . This signal controls the selector 57 so as to select the output of the display address counter 52 when the level is high, and the output of the adder 58 when the level is low. The signals on the line 83 to control the selector 56 are signals 慣, 棺 and 款 generated in the timing shown in Fig. 4. These signals are not as simple as those having only high and low levels. First, the signal 慣 instructs the selection of output of the J S area row counter 53. Consequently, the row count of the J S area row counter 53 and the column count of the column counter 55 are added by the adder 58. The added output is used as the address for the LA Table 42 through the selector 57, and the line attribute LA selected is transferred to the LA register 73 of the S S control circuit 7 through a line 80. In this embodiment, since the first partition is the area not subjected to smooth scrolling, the signal 棺 also instructs the selection of the J S area row counter 53. The output of the adder 58 this time is used as the address to take out the start address P e.g. P0 from the portion for the first partition in the SA table 41. The start address is loaded into the register 51, and when the control signal is generated on the line 82, it is transferred to the address counter 52 through the gate 90. The signal 款 instructs the selection of the S S area row counter 54, and the output of the adder 58 this time is used as the address to take out the start address Q e.g. Q0 from the portion for the second partition of the SA table 41. The start address Q is loaded into the register 51, and held there until the signal on the line 82 becomes high when the displaying on the second partition is started. The display counter 52 counts sequentially from P P0 to P 1, P 2 ... in the first partition, and from Q Q0 to Q 1, Q 2 ... in the second partition, and indicates addresses to fetch character codes from the buffer memory 43. Next, the configuration of the S S control circuit 7 will be described. The S S control circuit 7 comprises a select register 72 and a line attribute LA register 73 in addition to the controller 71. In the LA register 73, as described above, the line attribute taken out from the LA table 42 is loaded. The line attribute has a format schematically shown in Figure 3. The S S start bit is set to 1 only for the line attribute corresponding to the display row from which the smooth scrolling is started, and to 0 for other line attributes. The S S end bit is set to 1 only for the line attribute corresponding to the display row at which the smooth scrolling ends, and to 0 for other line attributes. The second partition start column data indicates the starting column of the second partition when the screen is divided vertically. The remaining information contained in the line attribute is used for other control which is not related to the smooth scrolling. An S S area select data indicating which partition of the two is subjected to smooth scrolling is loaded from the MPU 99 to the select register 72 through the data bus. Although the register 72 is used in this embodiment, it is possible to adopt a technique to use the line attribute containing the S S area select data. Fig. 5 shows the smooth scroll S S area which can be established on the screen of the CRT 1 in accordance with the content of the select register 72 and the LA register 73. The hatched areas are S S areas. Examples a and b illustrate to execute smooth scrolling over the whole width of the screen and only within a specific row range, respectively, without dividing the screen vertically. Examples c and d illustrate the vertical establishing of two partitions and the execution of smooth scrolling only in the second partition. As seen from the example d , a plurality of S S areas can be established by controlling S S start bits and S S end bits. The controller 71 has a configuration as schematically shown in Fig. 6 to generate an S S area signal on line 87 and an S S last line signal on line 88 for the control of smooth scrolling. A comparator 100 generates a partition indication signal to indicate whether the scanning lines on the screen of the CRT 1 are present in the first partition or the second partition by comparing the second partition start column indicated by the line attribute in the LA register 73 with the column count indicated by the column counter 55. A decoder 101 generates an S S enable column area signal in accordance with the partition indication signal and the S S area select data from the select register 72. An S S enable column area signal is of a high level only within the column display range enabling the smooth scrolling. A latch 102 is set when the S S start bit of the line attribute is 1, and is reset by an output of an AND gate 103 when the S S end bit is 1, the line count is 15, and the column count is 99. Thus, the S S enable signal from the latch 102 becomes high only within the line display range enabling the smooth scrolling. An AND gate 104 generates the S S area signal on the line 87 which become high only both two inputs are high. Eventually, the S S area signal indicates the time when the scanning lines are in the hatched areas of the screen shown in Fig. 5. An AND gate 105 gates the line count on the line 86 when the S S area signal is of a high level. As described later, this line count is the one generated by the line counter 61 in the line count circuit 6 and modified by an adder 64. Of course, in a certain case, the line count of the line counter 61 is passed as it is depending on the condition of the second input of the adder 64. A decoder 106 generates an S S last line signal on line 88 when the line count supplied through the AND gate 105 is 15. This signal is used for incrementing the S S area row counter 54 described above. In the offset register 62 in the line count circuit 6, the offset data to control the vertical smooth scrolling is loaded. The MPU 99 operates so as to change this offset data adequately. The offset data is transmitted to the adder 64 through the AND gate 63 when the level of the S S area signal generated by the controller 71 on the line 87 is high, and added to the line count of the line counter 61. Eventually, paying attention to a certain scanning line, the line count of the line counter 61 appears as it is on the line 68 outside the scroll area, whereas the line count to which the offset data is added appears within the scroll area. Fig. 7 shows the relation between 16 scanning lines in a certain row and characters displayed when the second partition is the S S area and the offset data is assumed to indicate 4. It is also assumed that the same character N is displayed in both partitions. As seen from this, since the sum of 4 and the line count indicated by the line counter 61 is used as the modified line count in the S S area, deviated horizontal parts are sequentially taken out from the character generator 3, whereby the display as shown in Fig. 7 is obtained. In the horizontal scroll area, the upper part of the character N is displayed in an upper adjacent row, and in the section below the scanning line indicated by line count 12, or, corrected line count 0 , the character which is present in a lower adjacent row is displayed. Eventually, if the offset data is increased by 1 during the vertical retrace time at a suitable interval, the display in the S S area is shifted by one line upward. On the contrary, if the offset data is decreased by 1, the display on the S S area is shifted by one line downward. Thus vertical smooth scrolling can be achieved. According to this invention, various areas of vertical smooth scrolling can be established, and the area can be changed easily. Therefore, versatile display operations can be performed.
