# Compact fluorescent light source and method of excitation thereof.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for general illumination wherein high frequency power is capacitively coupled to a low pres sure discharge. A discharge lamp 30 includes an envelope 36 which is typically pear shaped with a re entrant cavity 38 . The lamp envelope 36 encloses a fill material which forms during discharge a plasma which emits ultraviolet radiation and has an effective electrical impedance. The lamp envelope 36 typically includes on its inner surface a phos phor coating 42 . An outer conductor 32 , typically a con ductive mesh, is disposed around the outer surface of the lamp envelope 36 . A solid or hollow inner conductor 34 is disposed in the re entrant cavity 38 . The apparatus is con figured so that the capacitive impedance associated with coupling of high frequency power from the conductors to the discharge is much less than the plasma impedance.
