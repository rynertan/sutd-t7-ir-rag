# Multilayer column chromatography specific binding assay method, test device and test kit.

## Abstract
A specific binding assay method, and a test device and test kit for use therein, for determining a ligand, such as an antigen or antibody, in, or the ligand binding capacity of, a liquid medium, particularly a body fluid such as serum, wherein the unknown ligand competes with a labeled component, such as a radiolabeled form of the ligand or of a binding analog of the ligand, for binding with a binding partner, and wherein separation of the resulting bound species and free species of the labeled component is accomplished by allowing the liquid reaction mixture to be drawn by capillary action into a column comprising a bed of an adsorbent material selective for one of the two species. The improvement comprises using a column 20 containing at least one additional bed 23 of capillarily absorbent material disposed above said adsorbent bed 22 and which is substantially nonadsorbent relative to the one of said two species which said adsorbent bed selectively binds. The use of specific types of capillarily absorbent beds in addition to the selectively adsorbent bed to form multilayer columns overcomes several unforeseen problems encountered in using the previously known column chromatography method for certain assay applications.
