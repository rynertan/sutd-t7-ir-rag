## Abstract
A lateral transistor having a high breakdown voltage and operable with an improved current amplification factor and an improved cut off frequency comprises in a semiconductor substrate 14 of one conductivity type, a base layer 16 of the one conductivity type and an emitter layer 11 of the other conductivity type formed in the base layer. A first collector layer 12 of the other conductivity type is formed in the one principal surface of the substrate apart from the base layer and a second collector layer 13 of the same conductivity type having an impurity concentration lower than that of the first collector layer is formed between the first collector layer and the base layer in contact with the latter layers. Emitter, base and collector electrodes 17,18,19 make ohmic contact with the emitter, base and first collector layers respectively. The emitter electrode extends on a passivation film 15 covering the one principal surface of the substrate to terminate at a point on the second collector layer.
