# Process for synthesising N isopropyl N O carbomethoxyphenylsulphamide.

## Abstract
In order to synthesise N isopropyl N o carbomethoxy phenylsulphamide, sulphuric chlorohydrin is reacted with a pyridic base between 10 and 50 C, after which anthranil ic acid methyl ester is firstly added at 0 60 C, followed by isopropylamine at 0 60 C, and finally phosphoric anhydride at 20 80 C, the product being precipitated by dilution with water and recovered by filtration.
