# Guidance system for a mobile robot.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for guiding a mobile object along a path within a predetermined environment and a guidance system. The system comprises first memory means 7 to store prediction patterns of objects within the environment, second memory means 8 to store an extrac tion sequence of the prediction patterns of the objects stored in said first memory means 7 and a control device 2 which compares for matching the prediction pattern obtained from said first and second memory means and a feature pattern obtained from an observed image, on the basis of positional information of the mobile object 1 , and delivering a guidance signal thereto so as to diminish a difference between both patterns, when the pattern matching is possible.
