# High current diode pulse modulator.

## Abstract
In the circuit of the present invention, a first Schmidt trigger 1 , in combination with RC network 25, 13 , pro vides internal triggering to define the repetition rate and width of pulses produced by the circuit. The pulse output of the first Schmidt trigger 1 is appli ed to the inputs of a plurality of Schmidt triggers 34, 36, 38 connected in parallel. The outputs of the parallel Schmidt triggers 34, 36, 38 drive the base of a PNP bipolar transistor 40 connected between the positive and negative rail voltages through a pulse forming network 44, 46 . The collector voltage of the bipolar transistor 40 drives the gates of a plurality of N channel V MOSFET s 64a, 64d connected in parallel at their sources and drains between the positive and negative rail voltages.
