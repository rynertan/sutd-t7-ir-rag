# Improvements in or relating to resilient mountings.

## Abstract
A resilient mounting 1 , e.g. for supporting the ball race of a divided propeller shaft of a motor vehicle, comprises an outer rigid member 2 having an aperture 3 therein, an inner rigid member 4 positioned within the aperture 3 and a pair of axially spaced resilient annular load bearing diaphragms 18, 19 connecting the members and arranged one on either side of a plane including the centre of the mounting and extending transverse to the longitudinal axis of the mounting to define an annular chamber 21 . The outer rigid member comprises two annular ele ments 6, 7 which are axially separable thereby to facilitate removal of a mould core provided during manufacture to define the chamber 21 .
