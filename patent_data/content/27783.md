# Cut off tool.

## Abstract
The invention provides a cutoff tool that enables more narrow grooves to be produced in comparison with cutoff tools of conventional design. The tool consists of a holder 10 having a recess 12 in one side face 11 in which a cutting insert 13 is located and clamped by means of a centre screw 14 threadably engageable with the holder 10. According to the invention the insert 13 is of polygonal shape and provided with a protruding central portion 20, which is received in said recess 12 in the holder, whereas the remainder of the insert extends laterally from the holder for cutoff purposes. The protrusion 20 is polygonal in shape in correspondence with the shape of the insert but angularly offset therefrom.

## Description
Cutoff tool The present invention relates to a cutting tool and in par titular tu a tool for grooving and parting of operations, comprising a holder and a cutting insert releasably secured t1 cr eto, said insert being in the shape of a polygon the csorrlels o which act as cutting corners. t ie art of metal cutoff the prior art used so far employs a holder to which a cutoff insert is relesably clamped. The cramping means used oftenly include a lever type clamp actuatable by a screw engageable with the toolholder. The screw is usually actuatable from the top side of the tool and the longitudinal axis of the screw usually is oriented essentially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the clamp or the holder. Upon unscrewing said clamp screw the opposite rree end of said clamp has been urged to press the insert against its bottom supporting surface in the holder.Cutoff toolholders available heretofore equipped with similar clamping devices have been associated with certain disadvantages or limitations. The use of cutting tools for cutoff operations nowadays requires them to be able to take very narrow cuts or recesses in the workpiece. It is desirable that loss of material can be minimized, losses that can be substantial in amount for instance when cutting off extremely long bars into short pieces. Further, it is often necessary to have the tool mounted in up and down position in the pertaining machine. It should be understood that use of a top clamp acting on the insert puts a lower limit upon the minimum width of the recess produced by such a tool and, furthermore, that use of such top clamp is undesirable if the tool is required to be used in up and down position.According to the present invention there is now presented a solution that essentially reduces or eliminates this kind of problem. The tool of the present invention consists Or a holder and a cutting Insert releasably secured to the fore end of said holder, said insert being in the shape of a polygon the central portion of which being a protrusion extending from the remainder of the insert, whilst having the same outer configuration as the insert, the polygon or said protrusion, however, being annularly offs et from the polygon of the insert. This protrusion is adap ted to act as an inside abutment surface to be located in abutment with an opposed side wall in a correspondingly shaped recess in the holder.This enables to have only the corners of the insert exposed for cutoff operations without simultaneously being obliged to have these corner portions of the insert dimensioned for the cooperation with pertaining clamping means acting on the top side thereof. A considerable reduction in cutoff breadth is then achievable. At the same time this also enables the insert to be clamped laterally by means of a centre screw adapted to be threadably engaged with the holder from its side surface. The top surface of the holder is then free from can protruding portions.The invention will now be described more in detail with reference to the accompanying drawing in whichFig. 1 is a side view of a preferred embodiment of the cutoff tool or the present invention,Fig. 2 is a side view of the tool in Fig. 1 without pertaining cutoff insert, andFig. 3 is a top view of the tool in Fig. 1.The tool shown in Figs. 1 2 comprises an elongated toolholder 10 square in cross section, thus comprising a top face, a bottom, two opposed longitudinally extending side faces generally parallel to each other, a front and a back, said holder at one side face 11 having a recess 12.A cutting insert 13 is located in said recess 12, whereby said cutting Insert might consist ol cemented carbide or ariy otter similar mat rla sultab e for metal cutting pur Itoscs. ThL insert 13 is secured into said recess 32 by means of a centre screw 14, which passes through the Sn ert and is threadably engageable with a transverse hole 15 provided ded insaid holder.In order to enable simple tur ning and clamping the screw 14 is provided with a grip recess 16 . The recess 12 is confined by a base support surface 17, arranged in parallel with the plane of side surface 11 of the holder 10, and two angularly interrelated support surfaces 3 and 19 being arranged mainly perpendicular to support surface 17 whilst complementary to the shape of the insert 13.The insert 15 is polygonal in shape, in this preferred em bodiment in the shape of an equilateral triangle the corner portions of which are intended to act as cutting edges. The insert 13 is provided with a protruding central portion 20 which extends from the remainder or the insert. This central portion 20 has identical regular polygonal shape as the insert, said polygon, however, being angularly offset from the polygon of the insert. Only said central portion 20 of the insert is intended to be received in the recess 12, which, as appears from Fig. 1, is V shaped. One support surface 18 confining said recess 12 is inclined downwards towards the fore end of the holder 10, and both support surfaces 18 and 19 have their ends at the juncture with the lore end of the holder 10. The mutual orientation of said support surfaces 18 and 19 is such that a bisector to the angle between said surfaces 18 and 19 extends parallel with the longitudinal direction of the holder 10.Due to such orientation o said sui ort surfaces 18 and 19 j its been found that the forces acting on said support si faces 3H and 19 occurring from the pressure of the central portion 20 under the influence of the cutting Voices arc very moderate. It has to be understood, now ever, that deviations from the aforesaid interrelation of surfaces 18 and 19 might occur within the scope of the invention.In that connection it is recommended not to arrange support surface 18 such that it is inclined upwards towards the fore end of the holder 10, which would result in there being an acute angled material portion that would suffer most from the pressure occurring from said central portion 20 under the influence of the cutting forces that would reduce the strength of the tool. Further, it is preferable from strength and stability aspects to provide the central portion 20 with a greater thickness than the remainder of the insert.With the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 2 the insert 13 is an equilateral triangle and the correspondingly shaped central portion 20 is angularly offset at an angle of 500. Due to this the uppermost side edge of the insert 13, as seen inFig. 1, will be arranged parallel and flush with the top surface 21 of the holder 10 and one side edge surface of said central portion 20 will be arranged perpendicular thereto. This result occurs from the arrangement with two support surfaces 18 and 19 that diverge forwards towards the fore end of the holder 10 and the bisector therebetween extending parallel with the longitudinal direction of the holder. The manner of clamping the insert into the holder, i.e. by means of a screw engageable from the side or the holder into a laterally extending central hole 22 of the insert 13 also renders the top surface of the tool free from any protruding screw or clamping means, thus avoiding undesirable disturbance in the chip flow rearwardly.
