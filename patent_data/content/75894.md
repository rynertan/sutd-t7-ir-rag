# A rapid assaying method for guanase.

## Abstract
The guanase activity in body fluids such as blood serum can rapidly and accurately assayed by I decomposing guanine with the guanase in the specimen to xanthine and ammonia at pH 7 9, preferably at pH 8, II decomposing the xanthine formed by former step I with xanthine oxidase to uric acid and hydrogen peroxide, reacting the reactant solution of the former step II with 3 methyl 2 benzothiazolinonehydrazone, an aniline derivative such as N N di lower alkylaniline and peroxidase, and finally measuring the optical absorption of the reactant solution of the step III at 570 600 nm. The all steps can be completed within 15 minutes. Therefore, this assay is adoptable for automatic assay of guanase by usual clinically available automatic analysers.
