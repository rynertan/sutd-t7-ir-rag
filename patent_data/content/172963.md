This invention relates to new prostaglandin D analogues, processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Prostaglandins are derivatives of prostanoic acid 5having the following structure EMI1.1 Various types of prostaglandins are known, and their types depend on the structure of the alicyclic ring and the substituents. For example, the alicyclic rings of prostalOglandins F PGF , E PGE and D PGD have the following structures, respectively EMI2.1 In the above structural formulae or in the other structural formulae in this specification, according to the generally accepted nomenclature, the dotted line indi 5cates that the substituent attached thereto is behind the ring plane, i.e. is of the ot configuration, the bold line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is in front of the ring plane, i.e. is of the g configuration, and the wavy line indicates that the substituent attached 10thereto is of the ot configuration or the ss configuration or a mixture thereof. These compounds are sub classified according to the positions of the double bonds in the side chains attached to the alicyclic ring at the 8 position and the 12 position.15The PG 1 compound has a trans double bond between C13 C14 trans 13 and PG 2 compound has a cis double bond between C6 and a trans double bond between C13 C14 cis 5 trans 13 .

The cyclodextrin clathrates of the prostaglandin D analogues of the general formula I can be prepared using u n or r cyclodextrin or mixture thereof, using the procedures described in the specifications of British PatentNos. 1,351,238 and 1,419,221.Conversion into the cyclodextrin clathrate serves to increase the stability of the prostaglandin D analogue of the general formula I . The prostaglandin D analogues of the general formula I and their cyclodextrin clathrates have a specific strong anti tumour effect, and their toxicity is extremely low.They may therefore be employed as very effective anti tumour agents in the prevention or therapy of leukemia and solid cancer, and in treatment to produce remission thereof. In addition, prostaglandin D analogues of the general formula I have the effect of increasing the number of white blood cells in vivo. Therefore compounds of the present invention are effective as a preventive and therapeutic agent against infection by such microorganisms as bacteria and viruses. Compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat leukocyto penia induced by administration of conventional anti tumour agents, because such anti tumour agents generally cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells as a side effect. Furthermore, prostaglandin D analogues of the general formula I have a synchronization effect on the cell cycle of tumour cells. Cells differentiate and proliferate by repeating such cycle as G1 stage preparative stage for the synthesis of DNA EMI30.1 S stage stage for the synthesis of DNA EMI30.2 G2 stage stage for the synthesis of protein EMI30.3 M stage stage for cell division EMI30.4 G1 stage. The compounds of the present invention have the effect of synchronizing tumour cells which exist in four different stages in vivo, to the G1 stage.Therefore, when administering a conventional anti tumour agent which can only attack tumour cells at a particular stage, the compounds of the present invention increase the effect of the said anti tumour agent, In an in vitro test on the inhibition of proliferation of cells originated from human mouth tumour KB cells the compounds of the present invention showed an excellent anti tumour effect.The experimental methods and the results are described below.Test on Inhibition of Proliferation Using Cells Originated from Human Mouth Tumour KB cells Experimental Method The cells originated from human mouth tumour KB cells were added to Eagle s MEM culture solution containing 10 bovine fetal serum, the number of cells in the culture solution was adjusted to l x lO5 cells ml, a solution in ethanol of compounds of the present invention was added to give a concentration of 5 fg ml or below 3 points and the mixture was subjected to stationary culture at 370C for 4 days. As a control, a culture solution containing 0.1 of ethanol was similarly cultured. After the culture, the cells were stained by theTrypan Blue staining method, and the surviving cell number was measured to determine the IC50 value from the degree of inhibition relative to the control.

In such solid compositions, one or more of the active compound s is, or are, admixed, with at least one inert diluent such as lactose, mannitol, glucose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or magnesium metasilicate aluminate.The compositions may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g.lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, and disintegrating agents, such as cellulose calcium gluconate. The tablets or pills may, if desired, be made into enteric film coated or gastric film coated, tablets or pills such as sugar coated, gelatin coated ,hydroxypropylcellulose coated or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate coated tablets or pills two or more layers may be used. The compositions for oral administration also include capsules of absorbable material such as gelatin. Liquid compositions for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art such as distilled water or ethanol. Besides inert diluents such compositions may also comprise adjuvants such as wetting and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavouring, perfuming and preserving agents. Other compositions for oral administration include spray compositions which may be prepared by known methods and which comprise one or more active substances. Preparations according to the invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non aqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions. Examples of aqueous solvents or suspending media are distilled water for injection and physiological salt solution. Examples of non aqueous solvents or suspending media are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, alcohols such as ethanol, and Polysorbate 80 registeredTrade Mark . These compositions may also include adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, by incorporation of sterilizing agents in the compositions or by irradiation. They may also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. Other compositions include, for parenteral administration, liquids for external use, and endermic liniments such as ointments suppositories for rectal administration and pessaries for vaginal administration. The following Examples illustrate pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention Example 10 A solution of 1 g of 9 deoxy 9 PGD2 ethanolamide prepared in Example 1 in 5 ml of ethanol was well mixed with 5 g of microcrystalline cellulose and dried sufficiently. To the resulting mixture, 100 mg of magnesium stearate, 20 mg of silicon dioxide, 10 mg of talc and 200 mg of cellulose calcium gluconate CCG were admixed and then microcrystalline cellulose was added to make the total weight 10 g. The resulting mixture was well mixed to make it homogeneous, and then tabletted in conventional manner to give 100 tablets each containing 10 mg of the active material. Example 11 a and ss Cyclodextrin clathrate was prepared by the following procedure To a solution of 2.4 g of 4 cyclodextrin and 1 g of k cyclodextrin in 300 ml of water, 100 mg ofPGD2 ethanolamide prepared in Example 1 was added, and the mixture was thoroughly stirred. The resulting solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the clathrate of 9 deoxy 49 PGD2 ethanolamide. The clathrate was dissolved in 150 ml of distilled water for injection. The aqueous solution was filtered to sterilize it, pipetted into 5 ml ampoules to give 1.5 ml per ampoule, and freeze dried to give 100 ampoules for injection each containing 1 mg of the active material. Example 12 Tablets and solid preparations for injection each containing the compounds prepared in Examples 2 through 9 c as the active ingredients were obtained by the procedures ofExamples 11 and 12.
