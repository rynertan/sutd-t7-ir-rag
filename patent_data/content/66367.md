# Controlled slip torque converter clutches.

## Abstract
A torque converter clutch 28 has an engagement chamber 24 and a disengagement chamber 26 . The clutch engagement force, and therefore the torque capacity of the clutch 28 , is established by the pressure differential be tween the engagement 24 and disengagement chamber 26 . Fluid flow from the engagement chamber 24 to the disengagement chamber 26 is controlled by a sliding valve member 40 opened on by opposing governor weights 46 and 52 which are rotated with respective input and output members 10 and 28 of the torque converter, The valve member 40 can be controlled to effect complete clutch engagement if desired.
