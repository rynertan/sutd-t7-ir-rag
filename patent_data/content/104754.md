## Abstract
A semiconductor device includes a MIS FET comprising a drain 24 and a source 25 region formed in a semiconduc tor substrate 21 . The source region 25 is directly electrical ly connected to the semiconductor substrate 21 . This direct electrical connection may be formed by impregnating metal 29 through the source region 25 and into the substrate 21 . Alternatively this direct connection may be formed by a conducting layer 30 directly linking the surface of the source region 25 to the adjacent surface of the substrate 21 . This direct connection keeps the potential of the source region 25 at a reference voltage without requiring a wiring line led out from the MIS FET via a contact window and hence occupying a significant area of the semiconductor chip.

## Description
METAL INSULATOR SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and more particularly to a semiconductor device comprising metal insulator semiconductor MIS field effect transistors FET in which a wiring line for a reference voltage supply is not needed. Generally a semiconductor device such as a logic integrated circuit or a microprocessor device has a large number of wiring lines connecting various elements.Such wiring lines include voltage supply lines, various signal lines, input lines, output lines, and ground linesThese wiring lines occupy a relatively large area of the semiconductor device and generally determine the scale of integration of an integrated circuit.Ground lines in particular, occupy a considerable area and complicate the pattern layout of thepntegrated circuit. In prior integrated circuits comprising MIS FETs the source region of each MIS FET formed in the semiconductor substrate is connected to a reference voltage wiring line through a contact window that opens onto the surface of the substrate. In many cases, the semiconductor substrate is also supplied with the same reference voltage but because a pn junction is formed between the source region and the semiconductor substrate no direct electrical connection is formed between them to keep their potentials at the same level. Consequently, the reference voltage supply line is still required. According to this invention a semiconductor device comprising at least one metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor formed on a semiconductor substrate, the field effect transistor comprising a drain region and a source region of one conductivity type formed in a region of the semiconductor substrate of another conductivity type, also includes means for electrically connecting the source region directly to the semiconductor substrate. Particular embodiments of semiconductor devices in accordance with this invention will now be described and contrasted with conventional devices with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure l is a diagrammatic plan of the pattern layout of a conventional semiconductor device Figure 2 is a diagrammatic cross section of a conventional semiconductor device Figure 3 is a plan of a portion of the pattern layout of a conventional semiconductor device Figure 4 is a cross section through a portion of a semiconductor device in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention Figure 5 is a diagrammatic cross section of the first embodiment of semiconductor device Figure 6 is a diagrammatic plan of the pattern layout of the semiconductor device in accordance with this invention Figure 7 is a plan of the portion of the semiconductor device shown in Figure 4 Figure 8 is a cross section of a second embodiment of a semiconductor device in accordance with the present invention Figure 9 is a cross section of a third embodiment of a semiconductor device in accordance with the present invention and, Figure 10 is a diagrammatic cross section of a fourth embodiment of a semiconductor device in accordance with the present invention. Before describing the preferred embodiments of the present invention, one example of a prior art semiconductor device is described with reference to the drawings for the purpose of comparison. Figure 1 is a schematic plan view of a prior art integrated circuit semiconductor device. In the integrated circuit of Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 is aD A digital to analog converter with 6 bit precision, 2 is an address recorder, 3 is a D A counter with 13 bit precision, 4 is a reference voltage ground wiring line, and 5 is a pad. The integrated circuit of Fig. 1 comprises MIS FET s. Figure 2 is a schematic cross sectional view of anMIS FET in the integrated circuit of Fig. 1. In Fig. 2, reference numeral 6 is a drain region, 7 is a source region, 8 is a gate electrode, 9 is a semiconductor substrate, and 10 is a ground line. The semiconductor substrate 9 is of one conductivity type, and the drain and source regions 6 and 7 are of the opposite conductivity type. Since a pn junction is formed between the source region 7 and the semiconductor substrate 9, the source region 7 is not electrically connected to the semiconductor substrate 9. Thus, in order to keep the potential of the source region 7 at the ground level, the source region 7 is connected to the reference voltage wiring line 4 at the surface of the substrate 9, the reference voltage wiring line 4 is connected to one pad 5, and the pad 5 is connected externally to the ground. Figure 3 is the wiring pattern layout of a main portion of the semiconductor device of Fig. 1. InFig. 3, reference numeral 11 is an electrode contact window, 12 is a diffusion layer for drain and source regions, 13 is a polycrystalline silicon layer forming a gate electrode and a wiring line for it, and 14 and 4 are aluminum Al wiring lines. As seen from Figs. 1 and 3, the wiring lines, especially the ground wiring lines, occupy a considerably large area. These largely determine the scale of integration of the integrated circuit and complicate the pattern layout of the integrated circuit. A semiconductor device in accordance with a first embodiments of the present invention will now be described. Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of a MISFET included in a semiconductor device according to the invention. In Fig. 4, reference numeral 21 is a p type silicon substrate, 22 is a field oxide film, 23 is a gate oxide film, 24 is a drain region, 25 is a source region, 26 is a gate electrode, 27 is an Al drain electrode wiring line, 28 is a gate wiring line, 29 is a source electrode, 30 is a polycrystalline silicon film, 31 is an insulator film, and 32 is a thin oxide film. In the MIS FET of Fig. 4, the source electrode 29 is not connected to any wiring line to which a reference voltage is applied. Instead, the source region is directly connected to the substrate 21 as described below. The source electrode 29 is formed so as to contact the source region 25 without a polycrystalline silicon layer under the source electrode 29. By carrying out a heat treatment of approximately 4800C, the aluminum in the source electrode 29 is impregnated into the source region 25. Some of this aluminum is further impregnated into the substrate 21 through the source region 25. The source region 25 and the substrate 21 are therefore electrically connected through the impregnated aluminum. The potential of the source region 25 thus becomes equal to that of the substrate 21. Since the substrate 21 is connected to a ground line at the back surface opposite surface from that on which active elements are formed , the potential of the substrate 21 is equal to the ground level, which in turn makes the potential of the source region 25 equal to the ground level. Figure 5 is a schematic cross sectional view of the semiconductor device of Fig. 4. In Fig. 5, portions corresponding to those in Fig. 4 are designated by the same reference numerals. Reference numeral 34 is the impregnated aluminum. As shown in Fig. 4, in the semiconductor device according to the present invention, no wiring line for connecting the source region 25 to the reference voltage is formed on the surface of the substrate 21. Figure 6 is a schematic plan view of the semiconductor device according to the present invention, in which all the source regions having the reference voltage are connected directly to the substrate as described above. In such a semiconductor device, no wiring lines 4 for the reference voltage are necessary.Thus, the surface area devoted to circuiting in the semiconductor device of Fig. 6 is decreased by an area corresponding to the reference voltage wiring lines 4, as compared with the surface area of the prior art semiconductor device of Fig. 1. An outline of the prior art semiconductor device is shown with a broken line inFig. 6 for the purpose of comparison. Figure 7 is a pattern layout of a main portion of the semiconductor device of Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, corresponding portions are given the same reference numerals as in Fig. 3. As seen by comparing Fig. 7 with Fig. 3, the pattern layout of the semiconductor device according to the present invention is simplified by eliminating the reference voltage wiring line led out from the source electrode. Figure 8 is a cross sectional view of a semiconductor device in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 8, corresponding portions are given the same reference numerals as in Fig. 4. In the semiconductor device of Fig. 8, no polycrystalline layer is formed under the drain electrode 27. In addition, the diffusion layer for the drain region 24 is formed in such a manner that the depth of the layer at the portion below the contact window for the drain electrode 27 is greater than the other portions. As a result, the aluminum that impregnates the drain region 24 from drain electrode 27 does not reach the silicon substrate 21. On the other hand, the depth of the diffusion layer for the source region 25 is not so great that the impregnated aluminum from the source electrode 29 reaches the silicon substrate 21.Accordingly, in the semiconductor device of Fig. 8, the source region 25 is connected directly to the substrate 21 by the impregnated aluminum, but the drain region 24 is electrically isolated from the substrate 21 by the pn junction formed therebetween.The elimination of the process for forming a polycrystalline silicon layer simplifies the manufacture of the semiconductor device of Fig. 8. Figure 9 is a cross sectional view of a semiconductor device in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 9, corresponding portions are given the same reference numerals as in Fig. 4. The construction of he semiconductor device of Fig. 9 is essentially identical to that of the semiconductor device of Fig. 4, except that the contact window for the source region 25 is formed at the boundary portion of the source region 25 so that the source electrode 29 has contact with both the source region 25 and the silicon substrate 21 through a polycrystalline silicon layer 30. Accordingly, in the semiconductor device of Fig. 9, the source region 25 and the silicon substr te 21 are electrically connected through the source electrode 29. As described above, in accordance with the semiconductor device according to the present invention, the area necessary for forming an integrated circuit can be decreased so that the scale of integration of the integrated circuit can be increased. However, since a silicon substrate has rather low conductivity, the present invention is preferably applied to a small supply current circuit, such as a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS circuit. If a semiconductor device comprises both small current MIS transistors and rather large current MIS transistor, it is preferable that the source regions of the small current MIS transistors be connected directly to the substrate, and the source regions of the large current MIS transistors be connected to the reference voltage wiring lines through the contact windows. Figure 10 is a schematic cross sectional view of such a semiconductor device. In Fig. 10, corresponding portions are given with the same reference numerals as in Figs. 2 and 5. Although the source region is connected directly to the substrate in the above mentioned embodiments of the present invention, the source region may be connected directly to a well region when a MIS FET is formed in the well region in the substrate.
