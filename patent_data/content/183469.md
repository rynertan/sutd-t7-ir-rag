## Description
PHAGE RESISTANT E. COLI BACTERIUM AND METHOD FOR MAKING THE SAMEThe present invention relates to bacteria which have an essentially irreversible resistance to certain phage infection. Moreover, the invention relates to methods for making such phage resistant bacteria.Bacterial cultures are susceptible to infection by a wide variety of bacteriophages. Certain phage may infect a given bacterial culture resulting in the destructive lysis of the culture. In the past, such phage infection could be eliminated by destroying the phage infected bacterial culture. . These bacterial cultures were typically shall scale cultures which, if destroyed, could be readily replenished from non infected sources. Recent technological advances in the field of genetic engineering have created the potential to produce relatively large quantities of biologically active recombinant polypeptides. Mass production of such biological products, however, typically requires the fermentation of large quantities of genetically engineered bacteria.The effort and cost to generate such large scale cultures has created a need to protect them from destructive phage infection. Escherichia coli E. coli is a common host used to express recombinant polypeptides. One of the most virulent bacteriophages which may infect and lyse certain strains of E. coli is bacteriophage T1 hereinafter T1 . Infection by T1 is difficult to control since T1 is relatively air stable. Whereas in the past T1 infection could be overcome by periodically eliminating all cultures from a facility, in large fermentation facilities such culture elimination may require the destruction of large quantities of bacterial culture. Aside from the time and cost of regenerating such genetically engineered cultures from uncontaminated stock, such contamination may also destroy the parental strain for such genetically engineered cultures.Bacteriophage T1 and bacteriophage 80 hereinafter 80 are known to require at least two membrane proteins to infect wild type E. coli 1 . One of these proteins, fhuB also known as tonB , is required for a number of iron transport systems 2 . Another membrane protein is fhuA also known as tonA . This outer membrane protein is required for the trans location of ferrichrome across the outer membrane and is used by T1 and 80 to initiate bacterial infection by adsorption to this receptor 5 .Bacteriophage T5 hereinafter T5 also must interact with at least fhuA to infect 2 . It does not, however, require the presence of fhuB protein 2 . The genes which encode for these proteins are also designated fhuA and fhuB.A mutant E. coli bacterium which is deficient in the production of functional fhuA and or fhuB protein would be expected to be resistant to T1 as well as 80. Such deficiency in the production of functional membrane proteins may be caused by point mutations. For example, a point mutation may convert a codon for an amino acid in the wild type sequence, to one of three known termination codons. Such a mutation, early in the protein sequence, could produce a small non functional polypeptide. Similarly, a point mutation could result in the conversion of a wild type codon to one coding for a different amino acid. The resulting amino acid substitution, if in a critical part of the protein, could render the entire molecule non functional. Point mutations, however, may revert spontaneously, thereby regenerating phage susceptibility.Deletions of chromosomal material may also disrupt gene function. Deletions may be point deletions, i.e., deletion of a single nucleotide or sequence deletions which remove more than one nucleotide. A deletion within a particular gene generally results in an irreversible mutation. It has been postulated that two 80 and T5 resistant strains of E. coli, derived as either spontaneous or chemically induced mutants, are the result of a deletion covering part of the fhuA gene and a previously unknown fhuC gene 9 . These mutants, however, have difficulty utilizing rhodotorulic acid and possibly other hydroxamate siderophores which facilitate the transport of ferric ions across the cell membrane 9 .Besides point mutations and deletions, the DNA sequence encoding a membrane protein may be altered by the insertion of a transposon into the gene. Transposons are naturally occurring DNA sequences which may insert into a plurality of sites within a bacterial genome.Many transposons carry genes which confer resistance to a variety of antibiotics, e.g., tetracycline, streptomycin, kanamycin, etc. 11 . This antibiotic resistance provides a characteristic which may be used to select bacterial strains which incorporate a given transposon into a genome. Transposon TnlO, which carries tetracycline resistance, has been used to isolate mutants ofE. coli K 12 which resist T1 infection 9 . These mutants have been characterized as having a transposon insertion which disruptes the normal expression of fhuA or fhuB.These mutants may, however, revert to T1 susceptibility by the spontaneous precise excision of the transposon coupled with the loss of tetracycline resistance.The need, therefore, exists for a bacterium which is resistant to T1 infection, which does not revert to phage susceptibility and which substantially maintains wild type growth characteristics.Accordingly, it is desirable in particular to provide anE. coli bacterium which has a chromosomal deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence that confers essentially irreversible resistance to T1 phage infection and methods for making the same.It is further desirable in particular to provide an E. coli bacterium which has a deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence associated with the fhuA gene, thereby rendering the bacterium resistant to infection by the phages T1, T5 and 80 and methods for making the same.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a mutant E. coli bacterium derived from a wild typeE. coli bacterium, said mutant bacterium being essentially irreversibly resistant to phage which infect said wild type bacterium by use of at least one membrane protein in said wild type bacterium, said mutant being characterized by a transposon generated deletion or inversion of DNA sequence associated with at least one of said wild type membrane proteins.According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for making a mutant E. coli bacterium derived from a wild type E. coli bacterium, said mutant bacterium being essentially irreversibly resistant to phage which infect said wild type bacterium by adsorption to at least one membrane protein in said wild type bacterium comprising selecting a first bacterial strain from an E. coli transposon hop pool, wherein said first bacterial strain contains said transposon and is resistant to said phage, and selecting from said first bacterial strain at least one modified first bacterial strain characterised by the loss of a selection characteristic of said transposon and by a transposon generated deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence associated with at least one of said wild typeE. coli membrane proteins, thereby rendering said selected modified first bacterial strain essentially irreversibly resistant to said phage. In general, the present invention is directed to bacteria which have an essentially irreversible resistance to infection by a particular phage or group of phages. The resistance is imparted by generating a bacterium with a deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence associated with a gene or genes which are required by a particular phage or group of phages to infect the bacteria. The present invention is also directed to methods for making such phage resistant bacteria. a gene or genes which are required by a particular phage cr group of phages to infect the bacteria. The present invention is also directed to methods for making such phage resistant bacteria.According to the present invention, a bacterium with an essentially irreversible r sistance to T1 may be made by generating a deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence associated with a gene required for T1 infection. A transposon which carries antibiotic resistance is first inserted into such a gene to generate a T1 phage resistant bacterium. The transposon is then allowed to imprecisely excise from the gene thereby producing either a deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence required for T1 infection.More particularly, the present invention discloses methods for making an E. coli bacterium containing a deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence associated with the fhuA gene. Since fhuA is an outer membrane protein of E. coli which is required by the phages T1, T5 and 80 to infect E. coli 2 , the effect of a deletion or inversion of a fhuA DNA sequence is to impart in such bacteria an essentially irreversible resistance to infection by the phages T1, T5 and 80. Additional features of the invention will be evident from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a flow diagram of the method used in accordance with the present invention.Resistance to the infection of E. coli bacteria by the bacteriophages T1 and 980 may occur by mutations in the fhuA or fhuB genes of the E. coli chromosome. The fhuA and fhuB genes express membrane proteins that are both needed for infection by phages T1 and 80 2 . Mutaticns in fhuB are pleiotrophic and may adversely effect the viability of such mutants. Mutations in the fhuA gene, however, are far less severe in their effects on the growth and reproduction of such fhuA mutants.Mutation in the fhuA gene is, therefore, preferable in generating a T1, T5 and 80 resistant mutant capable of propagation and overall gene expression at rates equal to or not substantially less than the non mutated, wild type E. coli bacterium.Mutations in the fhuA gene may be characterized as point mutations, transposon insertions, deletions or inversions. Point mutations and transposon insertions may readily revert to regenerate the fhuA gene and T1 susceptability. Deletions and inversions within the fhuA gene are essentially irreversible events and are therefore preferred. Deletions may occur spontaneously or by chemical treatment 9 . The isolation of a mutant with a spontaneous deletion in the fhuA gene in a bacterial strain used for expressing cloned genes would be fortuitous but highly improbable. Deletions caused by chemical mutagenesis, however, may result in multiple deletions within the genome which may adversely affect the viability of the mutant 9 .In the present invention, the imprecise excision of a transposon is used to generate a deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence associated with the fhuA gene. The effect of such a deletion or inversion is the loss of functional fhuA membrane protein as manifested by the complete absence of fhuA membrane protein or by a fhuA protein which is either incapable of binding to T1, TS or 80 or functionally incapable of binding to the cell membrane.In general, a transposon generated deletion or inversion of a DMA sequence associated with the fhuA gene ofE. coli comprises inserting into the fhuA gene a transposable element which contains an expressible selection characteristic, followed by the selection of strains which are resistant to T1, T5 or 80 and which express the selection characteristic of the transposable element. The transposable element is then allowed to imprecisely excise from these strains to produce a strain lacking the selection characteristic of the transposable element but retaining the phage resistance due to deletion or inversion of all or part of a bacterial gene required for phage infection.Transposons with particular selection characteristics which may be used in practicing the present invention include TnlO tetracycline resistance, Tn5 kanamycin resistance, Tn3 ampillicin resistance, Tn 9 cloramphenicol resistance and other transposons known to those skilled in the art 11 . In general, this method may also be used to generate deletions or inversions of DNA sequences within fhuA of fhuB or other wild type genes required for phage infection.The use of a transposon to generate deletions has several advantages. In general, the deletion occurs only in the vicinity of the transposon insertion 6 .In addition, a variety of deletion mutants may be generated which have different amounts of a DNA deleted 6 . A transposon generated deletion which primarily affects the fhuA gene may be isolated thereby limiting the potentially adverse effects of the deletion. Thc use of the transposon to generate inversions is also advantageous in that such inversions generally occur between the transposon insertion site and a second locus on the genome 6 . As such, a part of the gene containing the transposon may be inverted to the second locus and replaced by material from the second locus. This is accompanied by the loss of the transposon. In this manner the expression of the gene originally containing the transposon may be disrupted. Depending on where the second genorr.ic locus is located, such an inversion may be mutaaenic for a single gene at the second locus if the second locus is within a structural gene or produce a polar effect if the second locus is within an operon.If the second locus is not within a gene or operon, the effect o the inversion may only be the disruption of the gene which originally contained the transposon.Inversions which primarily affect genes required for phage infection may therefore be isolated. A bacterium made according to the present invention and characterized by a transposon generated deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence associated with the fhuA or other wild type gene required for phage infection may, therefore, be distinguished from naturally occurring mutants having deletions or inversions, in that, the present invention allows the selection of mutants which have essentially irreversible mutations which primarily affect the fhuA or other wild type gene with little or no effect on other gene functions.Naturally occurring mutants, on the other hand, may have deletions or inversions which may disrupt the functions of numerous genes. Such mutations typically result in a single mutated strain which precludes the selection of a strain with minimal disruption of other gene functions. Further, chemically induced deletions may generate a number of strains with a variety of deletions within a bacterial genome. However, unlike transposon generated deletions, chemically induced deletions do not produce a range cf deletions originating at one point on the bacterial genome. A mutant strain with minimal disruption of gene function may there ore be difficult te isolate. Therefore, mutant bacteria made according to the present invention would be expected to have deletions or inversions of a DNA sequence which are more limited to a specific gene than naturally occurring deletion or inversion mutants or chemically induced deletion mutants.A bacterium characterized by a transposon generated deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence associated with the fhuA or other wild type gene is, therefore, a mutant bacterium with a deletion or inversion primarily affecting the fhuA or other wild type gene.In a preferred embodiment, E. coli strain W3110 is selected for constructing a W3110 bacterial strain containing a gene deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence associated with the fhuA gene. Strain W3110 is chosen because it is a common host strain for recombinant DNA product fermentations. This bacterial strain is the starting material for the method depicted as a flow chart in Figure 1.In general, E. coli h 3110 is transduced in step 1 ofFigure 1 by a lambda bacteriophage containing the transposable element TnlO X TnlO . The transduction by bacteriophage A TnlO results in the precise insertion of the TnlO transposon at a plurality of sites within the bacterial gnome without incorporating sequences from the bacteriophage. This bacterial pool is designated W3110 Tnl0. In step 2 in Figure 1, strains of W3110 Tn10 are selected for resistance to Af80 infection. Phage Af80 is chosen because it uses the fhuA protein to attach toE. coli and because A 80 is not as dangerous as T1 toE. coli stocks. These selected strains are designated W3110 Tn10 80R. Phage Af80 resistant strains of W3110 Tnl0 are pooled and infected with bacteriophageP1. The resulting lysate is used to transduce E. coliAT982 3 as depicted in step 3. Such transduction results in the recombination of DNA sequences of W3110 TnlO Af80R DNA with homologous sequences present in AT982.Strain AT982 is chosen because it contains a dapD mutation. The dapD gene is known to be located close to the fhuA gene 1 . As such, fhuA and dapD are 65 to 91E cotransducible 3 . FhuB and dapD, however, are not cotransducible. Transduction of strain AT982 by a P1 lysate of W311Q TnlO Af80R and selection of transductants which are tetracycline resistant and which regenerate the dapD function indicates that such transductants may contain TnlO within the fhuA gene.Other dapD mutants of E. Coli may be used in step 2 3 , as well as E. coli strains containing mutations in other genes which are contransducible with the fhuA gene 1 .In step 4 of Figure 1, tetracycline resistant strains with regenerated dapD function are the source of DNA for the bacteriophage P1 transduction of E. coli W3110. As stated above, such transduction results in recombination at regions containing homologous sequences. TransducedW3110 strains expressing tetracycline resistance and Af80 resistance are selected. These strains are designated as t. coli. W33i0 fhuA TnlO 80R. Such strains are functionally equivalent to the W3110 Tn10 X 80n strain obtained from step 2.The W3110fhuA Tn10 80R strains obtained from steps 3 and U are expected, however, to consist of strains with theTnlO i erted in the fhuA gene rather than the fhuB gene or other unknown genes which may also result in resistance to T1, T5 or 80 infection. Steps 3 and 4 therefore increase the likelihood of obtaining in step 5 a Ti, T5 or 80 phage resistant bacterium with a deletion or inversion of a DNA sequence associated with the huA gene. It is to be understood, however, that steps 3 and are not required to practice the invention.They are included only to maximize the probability of isolating mutants with Tn 10 in the fhuh gene and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.In step 5 of Figure 1, strains of E. coli W3110 fhuA Tn10 80R from step 4 or alternatively W31i0 Tni0 A80R from step 2 are selected on the basis of resistance to phage 80 infection and reversion to tetracycline sensitivity 7 . In reverting to tetracycline sensitivity, the TnlO element may excise precisely or imprecisely. A precise excision may regenerate a functional fhuA gene. Imprecise excision, which occurs at a frequency of about 10 4 per bacterium, cften results in a chromosomal deletion or inversion of sequences located close to the transposable element 6 . Since strains of W3110fhuA TnlO Af80R have been selected in steps 3 and 4 to maximize the likelihood that TnlO is located within the fhuA gene, imprecise excision of TnlC from such strains may be expected to generate a deletion or inversion of the fhuA gene to produce the strains designated E. coli W3110 fhuA Construction of h TnlO Lambda cI857 b221 Oam 29 is the starting material for A TnlO construction. This A phage is characterized by the combination of three well known mutants of A. The cI857 genotype produces a cl repressor which is reversibly temperature sensitive 12 .The b221 genotype 13, 17 is characterized by a deletion of non essentialX DNA sequences. The b221 genotype provides space within the X genome to accomodate the TnlO transposon.Further, the b 221 deletion removes the X int integration gene thereby rendering such phage incapable of normal integration as a prophage in E.coli. The Oam 29 genotype is characterized by an amber mutation in the B s 0 replication gene 14, 16, 18 . This lambda c1857b221 Oam29 is known to those skilled in 221 the art 14 and is constructed from the above genotypes by standard procedures. The TnlO derivative is also known to those skilled in the art and is constructed by the following procedures. A lysate of lambda cI857b2210am29, is prepared on the amber suppressor E.coli C600 ATCC 23724 which has been manipulated by procedures known to these skilled in the art to also carry the TnlO transposon 10 . This lysate is used to infect E. coli C600 R cI857 which contains an amber suppressor and a lambda prophage carrying the cI857 genotype. The preferred multiplicity of infection is 10. After incubation for one hour at 320C, the cells are concentrated by centrifugutation and plated on broth plates containing 15 vg ml tetracycline and 0.01M sodium pyrophosphate. The plates are incubated overnight at 320C. Lysates of tetracycline resistant colonies are prepared by heat induction. The tetracycline resistant colonies are first grown in broth at 320C after which the temperature is raised to 420C for 90 minutes.This lysate is plated on E. coli C600. The plaques appearing on E. coli C600 are replica plated at 320C onto E. coliC600 and E. coli W3102 sup imm434 which contains the heteroimmune prophage lambda imm434 16 . Plaques appearing on the heterolmmune strain are plated onto tetracycline plates The plaques that appear on these plates are capable of transducing tetracycline resistance and indicate that the phage contained in such plaques carry TnlO. The phage, so identified, are propagated in E. coli C600 and are designated l TnlO. Other types of A TnlO are known 16 . As a consequence the A TnlO used in conjunction with the present invention may consist of other A derivatives which are as effective as the l TnlO herein disclosedConstruction of e80 E. coli W3110 is infected with Á cI phage 15 and 80 phage ATCC 11456a B1 . The multiplicity of infection for each phage is about 5. The cells are grown for 90 minutes at 370C to produce a lysate. This lysate is plated on E. coli W3110 480 A at 370C. The plaques from this plate are subsequently purified on E. coliW3110.A lysate of the Af80 so produced is used to assay resistance to T1 infection.Crosses between A and 80 have been known for some time 19 . Other strains of x and 80 may therefore also be used in practicing the present invention. Such recombinants, however, must contain the 80 tail region to bind the fhuA membrane protein. Example 1 E. coli W3110 is transduced with Tn10 to generate aTnlO hop pool of E. coli W31 0. 10 The E. coli W3110 Tn10 hop pool is grown in L broth at 9 37 C to a cell density of about 1 x 10 ml. 0.5 ml of the culture is centrifuged and the pellet is resuspended in 0.2 mls of a Ad80 lysate containing 7.0 x 10 pfu.The phage is allowed to adsorb for 30 minutes at 370C.The suspension is then spread on EMB plates supplemented with tetracycline 15 ug ml . After an overnight incubation at 370C, the light pink are pooled in 3 ml ofL broth, grown overnight at 370C, washed twice, and resuspenGed in L broth. A bacteriophage P1 kc lysate is nade on this culture 8 .E. coli AT982 no. 4546, E. coli Genetic Stock Center,New Haven, Conn. is transduced to tetracycline resistance by this P1 kc lysate. Tranductants are selected onL broth plates supplemented with tetracycline 15 vg ml and 40 vg ml dap diaminopimelic acid . The resulting transductants are screened for tetracycline resistance and the regeneration of the dap gene dap , tetR . R dap , tet transductants are then tested for A 80 resistance. P1 kc lysates are then made on several dap , tetR, A 80 resistant strains. The lysates are used to transduce E.coli W3110 to tetracycline resistance. The transductants are screened and selected for Af80 resistance.Tetracycline sensitive isolates are selected from the W3110 fhuA Tn10 80R transductants 7 . These isolates are checked for Af80 resistance and tetracycline sensitivity after single colony purification. DA is Isolated from several tetracycline sensitive xt80 resistant mutants and digested with SstII. The SstII digested DNA is characterized by the Southern blot procedure using radioactively labelled and Sstll digested i TnlO DNA as a probe to determine if the TnlO has excised 4 . One of the tetracycline sensitive isolates is shown to have lost two of the only hybridization bands as compared to the hybridization betweenDNA from the x TnlO and the parental 3110 fhuA mn10X 80R. A third hybridization band has an altered mobility indicating that a deletion caused by the imprecise excision of TnlO has occurred.SDS gel electrophoresis of outer membrane preparations from the strain with an in precise TnlO excision reveal that the band assumed to be the fhuA protein has an altered electrophoretic mobility as compared to the wild type fhuA protein. The resulting protein is non functional as a 80 phage receptor protein. A second independent strain which also has undergone imprecise excision of TnlO shows no fhuA protein on theSDS gel. Neither of these strains demonstrate reversion to tetracycline resistance or to Af80 susceptability indicating that there is an imprecise excision of all or part of the TnlO transposon together with either a partial or complete deletion of the fhuA gene.It is apparent that the above described general method may be used to generate bacterial strains with deletions or inversions of a DNA sequence at sites other than the fhuA gene. Such deletions or inversions may impart desirable and permanent characteristics besides resistance to T1, T5 and cub80 phage infection. These bacteria and the methods herein disclosed to generate such bacteria are contemplated by the present invention. iIJing described the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it will appear to those ordinarily skilled in the art that various modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiment, and that such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.The references grouped in the following bibliography and respectively cited parenthetically by number in the foregoing text, are hereby incorporated by reference.
