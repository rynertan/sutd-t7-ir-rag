# FORMABLE LIGHT REFLECTIVE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A light reflective flowable and curable composition com prises a resin containing light reflective solid particles in an amount and of average particle size sufficient to provide the desired light reflectance transmittance characteristics to the cured composition. Preferably, the composition is self levelling and the solid particles comprise magnesium oxide, barium sul phate, aluminium oxide or mixtures thereof. The compositions of the invention are useful as reflective coatings in various applica tions, such as for radiation detector devices including scintillator crystals. For instance, a scintillator crystal block 1 , mounted on a base 4 within a housing 7 , has channels or grooves 3 separating it into elements 2 and these are optically isolated from one another by means of the light reflective curable com position.
