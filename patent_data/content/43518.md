# Switch for auxiliary motor vehicle circuits.

## Abstract
A switch for auxiliary motorvehicle circuits, such as courtesy lamp circuits and the like, comprises an elasto meric material block 10 having a lug extension 11 incorporating a substantially C like metal foil contact 12 , one leg 12a whereof is embedded in the lug extension 11 and the other leg whereof 12b being free to engage with a ground rheophore 13 , when the lug is not deform ed by the motorvehicle door pressure, to close the lamp circuit, and disengage therefrom when the lug 11 is elas tically deformed by the pressure applied on the motor vehicle door. Thus a switch is provided which, in addition to being very simple, reliable in operation, easy to install, does not require any fasteners, such as screws or the like, for the assemblying to the motorvehicle door.

## Description
This invention relates to a switch for auxiliary motorvehicle circuits in general, and particularly for the circuits of the so called courtesy lamps, which term designates herein those circuits which are intended to turn on one or more interior lighting lamps in the passenger compartment or other compartments of motorvehicles which are closed by means of doors or protected by gates, upon opening said doors or gates. For controlling the foregoing auxiliary circuits, it is current practice to use pushbutton switches the body or base whereof is secured to the uprights, or respectively to the peripheral edge, of the compartment, the movable pushbutton of said switch being engaged by the door hingedly mounted on said upright, or respectively by the compartment gate, while said door or gate are in their closed positions.The pushbattom has a movable contact which is urged to engage a corresponding fixed contact by the action of a spring, and said contacts are separated, in order to break the circuit electrical continuity, by the action of said door or gate, which move the pushbutton against the bias of the spring. Such switches have some drawbacks, being above all liable to jamming with some frequency owing to the penetration of water and dirt therein, difficult to install, and what is more important, complicated construction wise, so that their ultimate cost can be considered excessive with regard to their function. Thus the invention sets out to eliminate such drawbacks, by providing a switch particularly useful for the circuits specified hereinabove which is extremely simple, reliable in operation, easy to install, and in particular such that it requires no fasteners, such as screws or the like, of any kind. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a switch for auxiliary motorvehicle circuits, and particularly for motorvehicle courtesy lamp circuits, characterized in that it comprises a block of an elastomeric material haV n a lug extension incorporating a substantially C like met al foil contact, one leg whereof is embedded in said lug extension, the other leg being left uncovered to en gage with a ground rheophore, when the lug is not deformed by the door or gate pressure, to close the cir cuit, and disengage therefrom when the lug is elastically deformed by the pressure applied by said door or gate. The free end of the contact foil or reed is provided with an extension in the form of a Faston connector for receiving a corresponding terminal of the circuit lead,and the elastomeric material block, advantageously formed with a polygonal contour, has a groove adapted for receiving the edge of a corresponding polygonal opening formed in the vehicle body metal sheet. Thus, the switch can be quickly and easily installed by deforming the block to engage said edge with said groove, the reverse operation enabling the removal of the switch. Further features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description, in conjunction with the accompanying drawing , where Figure I is a cross sectional view of a switch according to the invention, showing it as installed Figure 2 is a top plan view of said switch Figure 3 is a front elevation view thereof and Figures 4 and 4a are side elevation views showing the switch in the closed and open conditions thereof, respectively. As may be noted from the drawings, this switch comprises essentially a block 10 of an elastomeric material, advantageously of either natural or synthetic rubber, which has a lug extension 11 capable of undergoing elastic fold over deformation relatively to the block. The lug incorporates one leg 12 of a metal foil contact 12, of substantial a ly C like configuration said contact being indefor marble and advantageously formed from either hard bronze or brass. The other leg 12b of the contact 12 is free and has an extended end 12 in the form of a connector, advantageously of the 11pastbn type, and adapted for receiving a corresponding terminal provided at the end of the circuit lead not shown .Said free end 12b of the contact 12 is adapted for engaging a ground rheophore 13, comprising a screw or the like, which is provided in a corresponding seat adjacent the switch, with the lug 11 in the non deformed condition. By contrast, when a force is applied to the lug which tends to press it onto the block 10 that is to fold the lug together on the block the end 12b of the foil contact 12 is caused to rotate and move away from the rheophore 13, thus breaking the circuit electrical continuity. It will be appreciated, therefore, how by installing the switch I on a fixed portion of the vehicle body, such as on an upright M, with the lug facing the movable portion formed by the door or gate P Figures 4 4a and the door or gate in the open position, the lug 11 will be in the non deformed condition 11a thereby the portion 12b of the intact 12 can engage the rheophore 13 to close the circuit Figure 4 . By constrast, in the closed position, the door or gate will squeeze the lug 11 and cause said foil portion to separate from the corresponding rheophore Figure 4, , thus opening the circuit. As shown in the drawing , the block 10 is provided with a peripheral groove 10a adapted for receiving the edge of a corresponding opening formed through the metal sheet L of the vehicle body, thereby the switch can be readily mounted and removed by elastically deforming the block such as to mutually engage, respectively disengage, said groove and edge. Advantageously, to prevent the switch from rotating relatively to the seat, the contour of the block and corresponding edge are mada polygonal. Of course, the effects of this invention will also extend to designs which achieve the same results on the basis of the same inventive concept.
