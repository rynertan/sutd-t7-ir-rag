# Steel strip continuous annealing apparatus.

## Abstract
A steel strip continuous annealing apparatus compris ing a steel strip feeder a heating soaking zone 20,30 for heating and soaking a steel strip at a predetermined temper ature a first cooling zone 40 for rapidly cooling the steel strip at a predetermined cooling rate a second cooling zone 60 for slowly cooling the steel strip or holding same at a predetermined temperature a third cooling zone for cooling the steel strip to substantially room temperature and a steel strip carry out device wherein the first cooling zone 40 incorporates therein forcible cooling means, the second cool ing zone 60 incorporates therein hot cold change over means and the third cooling zone 70 incorporates therein forcible cooling means, while said steel strip continuous annealing apparatus further comprises means for directly bypassing the steel strip from the heating soaking zone 20,30 through a first bypass passageway 51 to the second cooling zone 60 and means for directly bypassing the steel strip for the first cooling zone 40 through a second bypass passageway 54 to the steel strip carry out device so that the steel strips different in dimensions and required heat cycle can be efficiently annealed.
