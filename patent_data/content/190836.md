# Auditory stimulation using cw and pulsed signals.

## Abstract
An improvement in noise susceptibility is realized in auditory stimulation of the deaf by electrical signals. At least one analog electrical signal is applied to implanted elec trodes in a patient, and at least one pulsatile signal is applied to implanted electrodes. The analog signal represents a speech signal, and the pulsatile signal provides specific speech features such as formant frequency and pitch frequency.
