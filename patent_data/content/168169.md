# Twin reservoir heat transfer circuit.

## Abstract
A refrigeration or air conditioner circuit has an ejector 12,57 through which refrigerant is driven from a heated supply reservoir 1,2,50,51 to an unheated collecting reser voir 1,2,50,51 . The ejector 12,57 sucks refrigerant from a branch circuit 16 containing an expansion valve 19 and an evaporative, heat exchange 20 providing cooling. Valving 5,6 interchanges the functions of the two reservoirs when the refrigerant supply reservoir is empty so that operation of the circuit is uninterrupted.
