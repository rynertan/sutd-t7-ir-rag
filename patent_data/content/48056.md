# Device for the sequential processing of data records.

## Abstract
A device is described for the processing of a data base consisting of a sequence of data records. There are provided a reference memory 140 for a reference data record and a mask memory 142 for a mask data record. In reaction to the successively received data of a data record, these memories can be read in order to activate a comparison. There is provided an indicator element 160 which has a state provisionally correct and which is activated by a starting signal produced by the reception of a data record. If the comparison indicates that an impermissible relationship exists between the content of an element of the data record received and the corresponding element of the reference data record, the indicator element is set to the state incorrect . The data record received is meanwhile stored in a data buffer 100, 102 . At the end of the reception, the state of the indicator element indicates whether or not the data record may be applied to a user. The data buffer may consist of two buffer sections, each for one complete data record, which alternately operate in a read mode and a write mode.
