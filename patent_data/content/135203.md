# Composition for an optically readable information carrier.

## Abstract
The invention relates to information carriers for optically readable information. The information carrier is built up from an actual carrier and a metal layer provided thereon. The actual carrier is manufactured from a polycarbonate resin consisting of a mixture of an aromatic polycarbonate, an epoxy compound and usual additives. The presence of an epoxy compound in the polycarbonate resin results in a better bonding between the metal layer and the polycarbon ate resin. In order to be able to manufacture the actual carrier by means of injection molding, it is to be preferred to use a polycarbonate having a weight averaged molecular weight from 10,000 to 20,000.
