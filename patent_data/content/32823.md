# Wheel clamp.

## Abstract
A wheel clamp for mounting a wheel aligning tool is disclosed. A lower bracket, a center sliding bracket and an upper clamping bracket are mounted on a pair of parallel rods. The lower bracket is fixed to one end of them, and two rimengaging fingers project rearward therefrom. The upper clamping bracket slides on the rods, and a single rimengag ing finger projects rearward therefrom. The upper sliding bracket may be positioned on the rods so that the three fingers bear against either the inside surface or the outside surface of a peripheral lip found on the wheel rim. A clamp ing mechanism mounted on the upper clamping bracket fixes the upper bracket to the rods and stresses the rimen ging fingers against the lip. Alternative mounting means are provided on the center sliding bracket which allow the wheel clamp to be mounted directly on the lug bolts of a vehicle wheel.
