# Power assisted steering gear assembly.

## Abstract
A power assisted gear assembly in which a piston 3 forms with its cylinder opposed chambers 4,5 . Displacement of the piston provides a steering output and such displacement is effected by rotation of an input component 6 which screw threadedly engages the piston 3 . Two fluid systems are provided with respective inlets 18,20 and with the chambers 4,5 being located one in each fluid system. A valve 10,15,16 adjusted by the input component 6 when displacing the piston 3 controls fluid flow through the two fluid systems to an outlet 29 and such valve has a neutral condition to which it is biased by springs 25,26 or by fluid pressure in the fluid systems in which both fluid systems communicate with the outlet 29 for an open centre system.
