# Control system for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
There is provided a control system for controlling the opening degree of a solenoid valve 16, 18, 20, 22 provided in an air or fuel supplying system for engine to thereby control the air fuel ratio of the gas mixture being supplied to the engine. This control system includes means 102 for accumulating the number of revolutions of the engine from the time the engine starts. When the accumulated value reaches a predetermined value, it is decided that the warming up of engine is completed. Then, the output of the O₂ sensor 142 for detecting the oxygen O₂ concentration in the exhaust gas is fed back to thereby perform the closed loop control for the air fuel ratio. Before the accumulated value does not reach the predetermined value, the closed loop control is performed without use of the output of the O₂ sensor 142 .
