# Metal contaminant removal.

## Abstract
An electrolytic process for the removal of a significant proportion of one or more metal contaminants from waste water involves treating the waste water in an electrolytic cell 10 having a plurality of anodes 16 and cathodes 17 in an alternating arrangement. Each anode 16 has openings, such as perforations or open interconnected pores, to permit the waste water to flow through. Each cathode 17 is a metallized open cell organic polymeric foam substrate which has been metallized first electrolessly and then electrolytic ally.
