# RECHARGEABLE MANGANESE DIOXIDE ZINC CELL

## Abstract
A rechargeable cell is disclosed in which a positive elec trode is formed from a manganese oxide electrode material which contains a heavy metal selected from the group com prising lead, bismuth, and mixtures of lead and bismuth. A negative electrode is formed of zinc. A separator is placed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode. The separator is formed from a material which the negative zinc electrode to the vicinity of the positive electrode. An alkaline electrolyte is in contact with both the positive electrode and the negative electrode.
