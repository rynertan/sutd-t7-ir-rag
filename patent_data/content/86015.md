# Magnetic head having a step shaped gap.

## Abstract
The head 1 has two core parts 2,3 of a magnetic material between which a non magnetic transducing gap 4 is formed. The gap has a central part 21 having a gap length d which is selected to transduce the carrier frequency of a video signal and having a width which is defined by first and second side gaps 22,23 having gap lengths D which are selected to suppress the carrier frequency of a video signal, the first and second side gaps 22,23 being bounded by indentations 7, 8 in the sides of the core parts 2,3 and being filled with a material which bonds the two core parts 7,8 together.
