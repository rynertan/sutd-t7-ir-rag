# Nonwoven thermal insulating stretch fabric and method for producing same.

## Abstract
A nonwoven stretch fabric is provided. The fabric is produced from a web of bicomponent fibers bonded together by fusion of fibers at points of contact and thermally crimped in situ in the web. The fabric has good uniformity, good thermal insulating properties, and is produced by subjecting a fibrous web of thermally bondable, thermally crimpable bicomponent fibers to heated gas supplied con tinuously to the top of the web and intermittently to the bottom of the web.
