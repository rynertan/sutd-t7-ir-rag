# Drive mechanism for a drum.

## Abstract
A drive mechanism 10 has a frame 16 , a driven member 14 and a first element 20 rotatable relative to the frame 18 . A driving element 24 is mounted on and rotatable with the first element 20 . Apparatus 34 , such as a hydraulic motor 40 and pinion gear 38 , engages and rotates the driving element 24 . Apparatus 36 , such as a brake 42 and pinion gear 44 engages and controllably blocks the driving element 24 from rotation. Final drive apparatus 66 transfers rotational motion from the first element 20 to the driven member 14 , which can be, for example, a drum 14 of a compactor inside of which the drive mechanism 10 is located. The orientation of the elements of the drive mechanism 10 reduces its width which frees more area inside the space limited drum 14 and eliminates the need to mount components exteriorly to the drum 14 where they can be damaged.
