## Description
ANTISECRETORY BRC D CHAIN HETEROCYCLIC DERIVATIVES,PROCESSES FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE AND PHARMACEUTICALCOMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM. This invention relates to heterocyclic derivatives which are histamine H 2 antagonists and which inhibit gastric acid secretion. It is postulated that the physiologically active compound histamine, which occurs naturally within the animal body, is able to combine, in the course of exerting its activity, with certain specific receptors of which there are at least two distinct and separate types.The first has been named the H l receptor Ash andSchild, Brit.J.Pharmac., 1966, 27, 427 and the action of histamine at this receptor is blocked antagonised by classical antihistamine drugs such as mepyramine.The second histamine receptor has been named the H 2 receptor Black et al., Nature, 1972, 236, 385 and the action of histamine at this receptor is blocked by drugs such as cimetidine. It is known that one of the results of the blockade of the action of histamine at the H 2 receptor is the inhibition of the secretion of gastric acid and a compound which possesses this ability is therefore useful in the treatment of peptic ulcers and other conditions caused or exacerbated by gastric acidity. In UK Patent 1,341,375 there are described histamine H 2 receptor antagonists which are heterocyclic derivatives having a branched side chain to the end of which is attached, for example, a urea or guanidine residue. It has now been discovered that if a guanidino radical is substituted in the 2 position of the heterocyclic ring carrying such a side chain in the 4 position there are produced compounds which are potent histamine H 2 receptor antagonists. According to the invention there is provided a heterocyclic derivative of the formula EMI2.1 in whichD is an oxygen or sulphur atom or an NH radical E is a CH radical or, when D is an oxygen or sulphur atom, E is a nitrogen atom Y is a sulphur or oxygen atom, a direct bond or a methylene or sulphinyl radical P is a direct bond or an unbranched alkylene chain of 1 to 4 carbon atoms optionally substituted by 1 or 2 alkyl radicals of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and Q is an unbranched alkylene chain of 1 to 4 carbon atoms optionally substituted by 1 or 2 alkyl radicals of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, provided at least one of P and Q is substituted by at least one alkyl radical, that the number of alkyl radical substitutents on P and Q together is a maximum of 2, that when Y is a sulphur or oxygen atom or a sulphinyl radical P is an optionally substituted alkylene chain, and that when Y is an oxygen atom or a sulphinyl radical Q is an optionally substituted alkylene chain of 2 to 4 carbon atoms R1 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical of 1 to 10 carbon atoms A is a 3,4 dioxocyclobuten 1,2 diyl radical or a radical of the formula C Z in which Z is a sulphur or oxygen atom or a radical of the formula NCN, NN02, CHN02,NCONH2, C CN 2, NCOR2, NC02R2, NS02R2 or NR3 in which R2 is an alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an aryl radical of 6 to 12 carbon atoms and R3 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms B is an alkoxy or alkylthio radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a radical of the formula NR4R5 in which R4 and R5, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen atoms, alkyl radicals of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, alkenyl or alkynyl radicals of 3 to 6 carbon atoms in which the double or triple bond respectively is separated from the nitrogen atom of NR4R5 by at least one carbon atom, primary hydroxy alkyl or primary amino alkyl radicals of 2 to 6 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl radicals of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, or R4 and R5 are joined to form, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, a 5 or 6 membered saturated ring which optionally contains an additional oxygen atom or NH radical and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. It is to be understood that in the above formulaI and throughout this specification, although the double bonds in both side chains have been inserted in particular positions, various other tautomeric forms are possible, and this invention includes such tautomeric forms within its scope, both in terms of the compound of the invention and in terms of the manufacturing processes. When P or Q is an alkylene chain substituted by one alkyl radical, or by two non identical alkyl radicals on the same carbon atom, the compound of the formula I exists in two enantiomeric forms. When P and or Q is substituted by two alkyl radicals on different carbon atoms, the compound of the formula I exists in two diastereoisomeric forms each of which exists in two enantiomeric forms. When Y is a sulphinyl radical the number of enantiomeric forms in the compound of the formula I is doubled.The biological activity, as hereinafter defined, of these enantiomeric forms may differ and it is therefore to be understood that this invention encompasses both the racemate of the formula I, including any possible diastereoisomeric forms, and any enantiomeric form which possesses the disclosed biological activity, it being a matter of common general knowledge to one skilled in the art how to separate diastereoisomeric forms and how to separate a racemate into its enantiomers and determined the biological activity of each. A particular value for R1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl or n butyl radical. A particular value for the optional alkyl radical substituent on P or Q is a methyl radical. A particular value for R2 is a methyl, phenyl or E tolyl radical. A particular value for R3 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical. A particular value for B is a methoxy, ethoxy or LI methylthio radical or a radical of the formula NR4R5 in which R4 and R5, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen atoms or methyl, ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, n hexyl, allyl, propargyl, 2 hydroxyethyl, 3 hydroxypropyl, 2 aminoethyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl or cyclohexyl radicals or R4 and R5 are joined to form a pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine or morpholine ring. The following are 6 preferred features of the heterocyclic derivative of the formula I. When any of these 6 features is taken, either singly or in combination, with the other general or particular features of the heterocyclic derivatives of the formula I listed above, there are obtained preferred sub groups of compounds within the above general definition.1. Y is a sulphur atom and P is an optionallysubstituted methylene radical and Q is an optionally substituted ethylene radical. 2. Y is a direct bond, P is an optionally substituted methylene radical and Q is an optionallysubstituted propylene or butylene radical. 3.

D is a sulphur atom and E is a CH radical or a nitrogen atom.6. A is a radical of the formula C Z in which Z is a radical of the formula NCN.

Process d may be carried out using a dilute mineral acid, for example dilute hydrochloric acid, in a diluent or solvent such as water. The reaction may be accelerated or completed by the application of heat, for example by heating to the boiling point of the diluent or solvent. Process e may be carried out using a mild oxidising agent such as sodium metaperiodate in a diluent or solvent such as aqueous methanol or aqueous ethanol. The starting material of the formula II for use in process a may be obtained by reaction of a compound of the formula III with a compound of the formula R6 A R6 V in which R6 is a displaceable radical, for example an alkoxy or alkylthio radical, for example asset out inExample 3, 4 or 5. When D is a sulphur atom or NH radical, E is a CH radical and Y is a direct bond or a methylene radical, the starting material of the formula III for use in process b or c may be prepared by reaction of a bromoketone of the formula EMI8.1 with a compound of the formula EMI9.1 in which X is a sulphur atom or an NH radical, followed by hydrolysis of the phthalimido radical, for example as set out in Example 1 or 2.

When D is an oxygen atom, E is a C I radical andY is a sulphur or oxygen atom, the starting material of the formula III may be prepared by reaction of a compound of the formula HOCH2CO P C1 XIII with a compound of the formula XII followed by reaction of the product, the compound of the formula EMI10.3 with a compound of the formula X. When Disanoxygen atom, E is a nitrogen atom andY is a direct bond or a methylene radical, the starting material of the formula III may be prepared by reaction of a compound of the formula EMI11.1 with a compound of the formula XII followed by hydrolysis of the phthalimido residue in the product. When D is an oxygen atom, E is a nitrogen atom and Y is an oxygen or sulphur atom, the starting material of the formula III may be prepared by reaction of a compound of the formula EMI11.2 with a compound of the formula XII followed by reaction of the product, the compound of the formula EMI11.3 with a compound of the formula X.

The product from this reaction is then reacted with a compound of the formula X. When Y is a sulphinyl radical, the starting material of the formula III may be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding compound in which Y is a sulphur atom. Intermediates of the formula III and acid addition salts thereof are also within the scope of this invention. As noted above, the heterocyclic derivative of the invention is a histamine H 2 antagonist, inhibits the secretion of gastric acid in warm blooded animals and is therefore useful in the treatment of peptic ulcers and other conditions caused or exacerbated by gastric acidity, including stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to trauma. The histamine H 2 antagonist activity may be demonstrated on standard tests, for example by the ability of the compound of the formula I to inhibit the histamine induced positive chronotropic response in the spontaneously beating right atrium of the guinea pig or by its ability to inhibit the histamineinduced increase in the level of cyclic AMP in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor in a free cell suspension obtained from canine gastric mucosa. The guinea pig atrium test is carried out as follows A guinea pig right atrium is suspended at 1 g.tension isometric in a thermostatically controlled 30 C. tissue bath 25 ml. containing oxygenated 95 2 5 C02 Krebs Hanseleit buffer pH 7.LI . The tissue is allowed to stabilise over 1 hour during which time it is washed 2 4 times. Individual contractions are recorded with a force displacement transducer through a strain gauge coupler, and instantaneous rates are monitored with a cardiotachometer.A control response to 1 uN histamine is obtained after which the tissue is washed 3 times and allowed to reequilibrate to basal rate. After re equilibration for 15 minutes, the test compound is added to the desired final concentration. Ten minutes after addition of the compound histamine 1 vM is again added and the response to histamine in the presence of antagonist is compared to the histamine control response, The result is expressed as a percentage of the histamine control response. Thereafter the apparent dissociation constant of the H 2 antagonist is determined by standard procedures. All the compounds exemplified in this specification are active on the guinea pig atrium test at or below a bath concentration of 10 uM. The inhibition of the secretion of gastric acid may be demonstrated in standard tests, for example by the ability of the compound of the formula I, when dosed intravenously, intragastrically or orally, to inhibit the secretion of acidic gastric juice in, for example, rats, cats or dogs provided with gastric fistulae and whose gastric secretion is stimulated by the administration of a secretagogue, for example pentagastrin or histamine. The test in dogs is carried out as follows A female pure bred beagle 9 12 kg. having a chronic gastric fistula is fasted overnight with water ad lib. During the experiment the dog is lightly restrained in a standing position. When studying the test compound by the intravenous route, the fistula is opened and, after ascertaining the absence of basal secretion over a period of 30 minutes, a continuous intravenous infusion of secretagogue 0.5 umole kg hour of histamine or 2pg. kg. hour pentagastrin in saline 15 ml. hour is begun. Gastric acid samples are collected every 15 minutes. The volume of each sample is measured and a 1 ml. aliquot is titrated to neutrality with 0.1 NNaOH to determine acid concentration.When a plateau of secretion is reached, 1 2 hours the test compound is administered intravenously in saline and gastric acid samples are collected for a further 2 3 hours during which time the infusion of the secretagogue continues uninterrupted. When studying the test compound by the intragastric route, the absence of basal secretion over a period of 30 minutes is ascertained and the test compound, contained in 25 ml. of 0.5 w v hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and 0.1 w v Tween 80 in water Tween is a Trade Mark , is instilled into the stomach through a fistula dosing plug. One hour later, the fistula is reopened and intravenous infusion of a secretagogue, as described above, is immediately begun. Gastric acid samples are measured as described above and the approach of acid secretion to a plateau is compared to that of a control animal which is dosed intragastrically only with the dosing vehicle. When studying the test compound by the oral route, it is administered in a gelatin capsule washed down with 15 ml. of water. One hour later, the fistula is opened and instravenous infusion of the secretagogue is immediately begun. Gastric acid samples are measured as above and the approach of acid secretion to a plateau is compared to that of an undosed control animal. The results obtained in the atrium test are predictive of activity in the dog test. two overt tonicity or side effects were noted during the dog tests. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a heterocyclic derivative of the invention in association with a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral or topical administration, for which purposes it may be formulated by means known to the art into the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders, suppositories, sterile injectable aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions, gels, creams, ointments or lotions. In addition to the heterocyclic derivative of the formula I, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention for oral, rectal or parenteral administration may also contain, or be co administered with, one or more known drugs selected from antacids, for example aluminium hydroxide magnesium hydroxide mixtures antipepsin compounds, for example pepstatin other histamine H2 antagonists, for example cimetidine ulcer healing agents, for example carbenoxolone or bismuth salts anti inflammatory agents, for example ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen or aspirin prostaglandins, for example 16,16 dimethylprostaglandinE2 classical antihistamines histamine H l antagonists , for example mepyramine or diphenhydramine anticholinergic agents, for example atropine or propantheline bromide and anxiolytic agents, for example diazepam, chlordiazepoxide or phenobarbital. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention for topical administration may also contain, in addition to the heterocyclic derivative, one or more classical antihistamines histamine H l antagonists , for example mepyramine or diphenhydramine and or one or more steroidal anti inflammatory agents, for example fluocinolone or triamcinolone. A topical formulation may contain 1 10 wiw of the heterocyclic derivative of the invention. A preferred pharmaceutical composition of the invention is one suitable for oral administration in unit dosage form, for example a table or capsule which contains between 10 mg. and 500 mg. of the heterocyclic derivative, or one suitable for intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, for example a sterile injectable containing between 0.1 and 10 w w of the heterocyclic derivative. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention will normally be administered to man for the treatment of peptic ulcers and other conditions caused or exacerbated by gastric acidity in the same general manner as that employed for cimetidine, due allowance being made in terms of dose levels for the potency of the heterocyclic derivative of the present invention relative to cimetidine. Thus each patient will receive an oral dose of between 20 mg. and 1500 mg. and preferably between 50 mg. and 500 mg. of heterocyclic derivative or an intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular dose of between 2.5 mg. and 150 mg, and preferably between 10 mg. and 50 mg. of the heterocyclic derivative, the composition being administered 2 to 4 times per day. The rectal dose will be approximately the same as the oral dose.The composition may be administered less frequently when it contains an amount of heterocyclic derivative which is a multiple of the amount which is effective when given 2 4 times per day. The invention is illustrated, but not limited by the following Examples in which the temperatures are in degrees Centigrade Example 1 A solution of 2 guanidino 4 4 amino l methylbutyl thiazole dihydrobromide 1.14 g. in methanol 10 ml. was treated with a solution of potassium hydroxide 0.378 g. in methanol 10 ml. .The solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue extracted with warm ethanol 50 ml. .
