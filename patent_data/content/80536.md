## Description
The invention relates to a cardiac stimulator pacemaker . In particular, the invention relates to a cardiac stirnuiator adapted either to a stimulate the heart or another organ or both these organs of a patient by means of electrical current, especially one or moe electrical pulses, in an emergency situation arising, for example, during intensive care of this patient, or b to temporarily vary the heart rhythm of a patient for diagnostic purposes. Normally, when a patient is in intensive care, use is made of a catheter by means of Which it is possible only to transfer measuring signals, which are inicative of parameters characteristic of a physical condition of the patient, frcm this patient to external treasuring or rronitoring equipment. In the event of an unexpected emergency situaticn requiring the heart and or another organ to be stimulated, a stimulating catheter must be inserted as rapidly as possible. This generally used method is not only time wasting and cumbersome, Which can have fatal consequences in an emergency situation, but also means additional risk and or inconvenience for the patient.These objections likewise apply to the situation in Which the heart rhythm is to be temporarily varied, although then the requirement of rapid insertion is less important. The above Objections may be met by using a catheter of special structure employing electrodes that are electrically connectable through metallic conductors extending in the catheter to external equipment, thus permitting the derivation of signals fran the inside the heart and or the stimulation of the heart ty means of electrical pulses. Such special catheters, however, are relatively expensive.From considerations of economy and on the basis of statistical data, it is therefore oonsidered desirable and justifiable to normally use catheters of simple and cheaper structure in intensive care. It is an Object of the present invention to eliminate the above drawbacks and render it possible to electrically stimulate the heart and or other organs of a patient in a simple and rapid manner While using catheters of relatively simple and cheap structure. The e present invention is bases an the idea of using a metallic medium of low electrical conductivity for the transport of the electrical current required for cardiac stimulation, which medium is included in a catheter of normal and relatively cheep structure. In particular, for the purpose of such transport of current use nay be made of either the column of liquid present in the catheter, particularly an electrolytic solution, or a thin non metallic film of loa electrical conductivity provided on the inner wall of the catheter, or fibrous cores of a low electrical conductivity material extending in a wall of such a catheter. A cardiac stimulator according to the invention is characterized by an electrical high voltage circuit adapted to produce at its output such a high voltage that in a high impedance load circuit electrically connected to this output an electrical stimulus of an intensity and waveform suitable for cardiac stimulation is produced. In particular, a cardiac stimulator according to the invention is characterized in that the aforesaid output is adapted to be connected to.a lumpen of a catheter so that this output is electrically connected to either an electrolytic solution present in this lunen, or a thin non metallic film of low electrical conductivity provided on the inner wall of the lumen, or one or more fibrous cores of a electrical conductivity material extending in the wall of the lumen. A preferred embodiment of a cardiac stimulator according to the invention is characterized by a knawn per se cardiac stimulator generator including facilities permitting an optional adjustment of the signal produced by this generator at its output the aforesaid electrical high voltage circuit includes a control input connected to the output of the cardiac stimulator generator. The invention will be described in greater detail hereinafter. A cardiac stimulator according to the invention is cable of performing all 1 of the activities feasible with conventional cardiac stimulators, but using a catheter that need rot include metallic conductors extending therein and stimulation electrodes connected therewith.In other words, a cardiac stimulator according to the invention is adapted to transport the electrical signals required for a desired form of cardiac stimulation via a non metallic current path of low electrical conductivity, i.e. high electrical impendance. The aforesaid activities are, inter alia a the application of fixed frequency stimulation pulses b the application of stimulation pulses only in response to a request signal produced by a detector only in the event of an atrium or a ventricle or both skipping a beat c a combination of the activities sub a and d the application of stimulation pulses of a frequency higher than the normal heart rhythm, if necessary in combination with facilities for automatically switching to a desired rhythm e the defibrillation of an atrium and or ventricle by the application of one or more pulses having suitable characteristics, if necessary in catibination with facilities for measuring the changes resulting fran such an activity, and the repetition of this procedure either on its own initiative or in response to an external command, if necessary in combination with the possibility to alter the characteristics of the respective pulse or pulses, until the desired result has been achieved, f cardioversion by the application of one or more pulses so called burst paclng , which procedure may be repeated, automatically or not, until the desired effect has been reached g the temporary application of signals for causing rhythm failures, for example for halting re entry tachycardias h the stimulation via the left riglxt ventricle or the left rigbt atrium, for example in emergencies during catheterization and i the so called double demand pacng . A cardiac stmulator according to the invention comprises an electrical high voltage circuit adapted to produce electrical pulses of such intensity and waveform that, When such a high voltage circuit is electrically connected to a high impedance as presented by a non metallic current path as formed by a catheter including no conductors, the electrical current required for the desired operation is active at the desired place.The output of such an electrical high voltage generator includes a set of electrical supply leads electrically connected, on the one hand, to one or more electrodes to be placed on the patient and cn, the other hand, to a metal valve, wnicb, may be of standard design, or an electrically conductive auxiliary means which for instance is adapted to be mounted on or to perforate the respective catheter. Such a valve or auxiliary means is arranged for forming an electrical connection with either an electrolytic solution present in the catheter, or a thin ronmetal1ic film of low electrical conductivity prcvided on the inner well of a lumpen of the catheter, or one or mare fibrous cores of a low electrical conductivity material extending in the wall of a linen of this catheter. In addition to unipolar operation, in which only one liquid column of an electrolytic solution or one thin non metallic film on the inner wall or one set of fibrous cores is required, also either bipolar or multipolar operation falls within the scope of the present invention. In that case, however, t or more separate liquid colunns of an electrolytic solution or two or more separate thin non metallic films on the inner wall or t or more separate sets of fibrous cores of a low electrical conductivity material are required. An electrical high voltage circuit according to the invention may be combined with facilities suited to prevent, inter alia, firing at inappropriate moments A preferred ewbcdiment of a cardiac stimulator according to the invention includes a cardiac stimulator generator of known per se arrangement with facilities permitting an optional adjustment of the signal produced by this generator at its output. The electrical high voltage circuit in this preferred embodiment includes a control input connected to the output of this known Per se cardiac stimulator generator. In a preferred ejoiment of the invention an electrical generator for causing the muscles of a body to react to an electrical stimulus is adapted to cause an electrical current in the range of f.i.1 5 milliamps to flow through an electrically conductive liquid, for example a conventional saline solution, providing a current path to the area of the body to be stimulated. In particular, an electric generator of this type compromises an output circuit for producing a high voltage, for example in the range of 1 10 kilovolts, across an electrical load including this electrically conductive liquid with an 6 internal impedance of, for example, 10 ohms looking into the output circuit of the electrical generator, and an overall impedance of 106 for the electrical load, a voltage of 10 kilovolts produced at the output of the generator across the load causes a current of 5 milliamps to flow therethrough. In a simple embodiment the output circuit includes a transformer adapted to produce across its output winding the high voltage as required for causing the relatively low current to flow through the load. In another embodiment such a cardiac stimulator according to the invention ca prises an electrical high voltage circuit, consisting of a high voltage generator Which forms together with or without passive or active components a high voltage circuit adapted to produce electrical pulses of such an intensity, waveform and repetition rate that, When such a high voltage circuit is connected with a catheter which is part of the load and having an ieeance ranging from a few Ohms up to sone Mega Ohms, an electrical current is generated for the desired operation, active at the desired place. Such a circuit arrangement for instance comprises a feedback control circuit Which is adapted for maintaining the output current within the desired limits. In another embodyment said circuitarrangement includes measuring means for measuring the loadresistance and adjusting, in response to the measuring results, the high voltage in order to achieve the desired output curent. The invention is not limited to such embodiments.
