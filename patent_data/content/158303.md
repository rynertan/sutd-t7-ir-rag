## Description
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of benzothiazepin derivatives of general formula I wherein R stands for hydrogen and acetyl, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The benzothiazepin derivatives of general formula I being cis 2 4 methoxyphenyl 3 acetyloxy 5 2 dimethylamino ethyl 2,3 dihydro 1,5 benzothiazepin 4 5H one hereinafter called diltiazem , is an effective calcium antagonist. The compound in which R stands for hydrogen serves as intermediate for the preparation of diltiazem. British patent specification No. 1236467 describes the preparation of a compound of general formula I by converting a corresponding compound of general formula II into its alkali metal salt by treating it with an alkali metal, e.g. sodium and potassium an alkali metal hydride and an alkali metal amide, in a solvent, e.g. dioxane, toluene, xylene or dimethylsulfoxide whereafter said alkali metal salt is reacted with a 2 dimethylamino ethyl halide of general formula III in which Hal stands for a halogen atom. It is known that working with alkali metals, alkali metal hydrides and alkali metal amides is in most instances dangerous. Moreover, the procedure being mentioned in said British specification as being preferred, namely the use of sodium hydride and of dimethylsulfoxide, is considered to be unsafe for industrial use, as explosions have been reported when this system was used. European patent specification No. 81234 describes the preparation of a compound of general formula I in which R has the same meaning as above in which a corresponding compound of general formula II is reacted with a compound of general formula III in the presence of potassium hydroxide in acetone or in the presence of potassium carbonate in acetone, in a lower alkyl acetate or in a mixture of one of said solvents with water. The solvents used in this process are highly combustible. Thus, special explosion proof equipment has to be used and precautions have to be taken for carrying out said process on an industrial scale. In both of the above processes when the compound of formula II wherein R stands for hydrogen, is treated with a compound of formula III, the product obtained, if desired, is not directly acetylated but is first purified by converting it into its hydrochloride. From Japanese patent specification No. 58 029779 there is known a process for the preparation of a compound of general formula I in which R stands for acetyl in which a compound of general formula II, in which R stands for acetyl, is reacted with a compound of general formula III with a base in an essentially anhydrous organic solvent in the presence of an intraphasal transfer catalyst. The only example given in said specification uses as base potassium hydroxide, as solvent acetonitrile and as catalyst a crown ether. The other bases which are specifically mentioned are other alkali metal hydroxides. The use of an alkaline earth metal hydroxide has not been mentioned. The yield given in said specification is unsatisfactory. Some of the above known processes use solvents which are quite expensive and even toxic. Moreover, in those processes in which the intermediate, i.e. the compound of general formula I in which R stands for hydrogen, has to be converted into diltiazem, said intermediate has first to be isolated and purified. The object of the present invention is thus to provide a process for the preparation of compounds of general formula I which overcomes many of the above drawbacks. This process should give good yields, very pure compounds, be safe and economic, not require complicated apparatus, utilise relatively cheap, non toxic and non combustible solvents and not require anhydrous conditions and the use of dehydrating agents. Moreover, it should not require the purification of the intermediate when diltiazem has to be prepared. The present invention thus consists in a process for the preparation of compounds of general formula I or of acid addition salts thereof in which a corresponding compound of general formula II is reacted with 2 dimethylamino ethyl chloride in a biphasic system of water and a non combustible aliphatic polychlorinated hydrocarbon solvent in the presence of calcium hydroxide or of barium hydroxide. The compound of general formula I wherein R stands for hydrogen obtained from the reaction can, if desired, be acetylated directly without purification. The compounds of general formula I are, if desired, converted into their acid addition salts by reacting same in a suitable solvent with an appropriate inorganic or organic acid. The compounds of general formula I obtained by the reaction are isolated by methods known per se. The reaction is advantageously carried out at temperatures between 15 all temperatures are given herein in degress centigrade and the refluxing temperature of the aliphatic polychlorinated hydrocarbon solvent, preferably between 25 and 70 . Suitable hydrocarbon solvents are, for example, methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,2 dichloroethane. The process according to the present invention may be performed, if desired, in the presence of a suitable quaternary ammonium halide, e.g. triethylbenzylammonium chloride or didecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide. The amount of calcium hydroxide or of barium hydroxide to be used in the process according to the present invention is preferably 1 3 moles, especially 2 2.5 moles, per mole of the compound of general formula II. The amount of aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent used is preferably 15 40 ml, especially 15 25 ml per g of said compound of general formula II. The suitable amount of water is preferably 3 10 ml, especially 4 6 ml, per g of said compound of general formula II. The suitable ratio between said aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbon and water is preferably 2 1 to 10 1. A suitable amount of quaternary ammonium hallide, if present, is 1 10 , preferably 6 8 , by weight of said compound of general formula II. When calcium or barium hydroxide were substituted by ammonia, magnesium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium carbonate, using the above conditions, unsatisfactory results were obtained. The compounds of general formula II exist in the form of two stereoisomers and each one exists further in the form of two optical isomers. All of said isomers or mixtures thereof can be used in the present invention to give the corresponding isomer of general formula I. The process according to the present invention overcomes many of the drawbacks of the known processes. It gives good yields of a product of high purity, is safe and economic, utilises relatively cheap, nontoxic and non combustible solvents and does not require anhydrous conditions and the use of dehydrating agents. Moreover, the compound of general formula I in which R stands for hydrogen need not be purified but can directly be acetylated to give the compound of general formula I in which R stands for acetyl. Thus, at least one chemical step is saved. The compounds of general formula II can be prepared by methods known per se, for example those described in H. Kugita et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull.
