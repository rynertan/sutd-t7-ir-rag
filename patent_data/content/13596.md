# Luminance delay control apparatus in PAL SECAM television receiver.

## Abstract
In a dual standard PAL SECAM color TV reciever, an identification system 15 provides a mode switching output, permitting automatic switching 17 of the receiver between a PAL reception mode of operation and a SECAM reception operating mode, in dependence upon the PAL or SECAM nature of the transmission received. In the SECAM reception mode, a PAL decoder 19 receives the chrominance compo nent output of a SECAM PAL transcoder 13 in the PAL reception mode, the PAL decoder receives via 21 chromi nance signals which bypass the transcoder 13 . To equalise the signal delays in the chrominance and luminance signal channels of the receiver in the two operating modes, the luminance channels includes a switchable luminance signal delay line 33 in cascade with a chrominance component trap circuit 60, 80 . The switchable delay line 33 is controlled by the mode switching output of the identification system 15 such that delay line 33 is interposed in luminance signal path only during SECAM reception mode operation. The delay magnitude provided by delay line substantially matches dif ference in delays suffered by chrominance information during operation in the respective modes. The trap circuit, 60, 80 providing luminance delay substantially compensating the delay suffered by chrominance information during operation in PAL reception modo, includes resonant circuits 60, 80 tuned respectively to the two SECAM subcarrier resting fre quencies.
