# Preparation of hydroxy aromatic carboxylic acids and ester derivatives thereof.

## Abstract
A process for preparing hydroxy aromatic carboxylic acids, or the ester derivatives thereof, comprises carbonylat ing a hydroxy aromatic halide in the presence of a reactive alcohol solvent and a catalytic amount of a Group VIII metal catalyst. The process has particular applicability to the preparation of 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid from 6 bromo 2 naphthol, which can be easily prepared from Î² naphthol, a readily available and inexpensive starting material.
