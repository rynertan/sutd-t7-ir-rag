## Description
SHOT PEENINGOR BLASTING APPARATUS This invention relates to a shot peening apparatus and, more particularly, to a shot peening or blasting apparatus capable of providing usable peening or blasing intensity over a large surface of a workpiece. It has been found desirable for producing relatively smoothly peened or blasted surfaced workpieces and or for shaping workpieces, such as metal sheet, plate or structural members, by shot peening or blasting to achieve such shot peening or blasting by propelling shot under low pressure air and or gravity forces. Such peening or blasting process and apparatuses are exemplified in U.S. Patent No 3,705,511. However, it has been found that relying solely on gravity for propelling the shot has posed problems of suitability of the peening or blasting apparatus for a wide range of different workpiece materials because the velocity of the shot could not be varied commensurate with the kind of material to be shot peened or blasted and or type of shot peening or blasting to be accomplished. According to the present invention there is provided a shot peening or blasting apparatus for shot peening or blasting the surface of a workpiece, comprising a guide duct means for receiving and conducting shot and having an upper inlet end portion and a lower outlet end portion b gravity feed means receiving shot from a source of supply thereof and for conveying and discharging shot by gravity c impact means interposed between the upper inlet end position of said guide duct means and said gravity feed means which utilizes a portion of the kinetic energy of the shot discharging from the gravity feed means to effect substantially uniform distribution of the shot in the guide duct means and d a nozzle means for receiving the substantially uniformly distributed shot from the guide duct means at gravitational velocity and for directing the shot to impact against a workpiece. In a narrower aspect of the invention, the shot peening apparatus includes a plenum means disposed adjacent said nozzle means and forming a plenum which contains a gaseous fluid at low static pressure for accelerating the shot in a direction out of said nozzle means. In this aspect of the invention and by controlling the amount of gaseous fluid pressure, the acceleration of and hence the impacting velocity of the shot can be varied as desired and commensurate with the material of which the workpiece is made and or the particular requirements for shaping a workpiece for deformation sometimes known as peen forming . A feature of this invention is a blower for supplying the gaseous fluid, such as air, in the plenum. The blower is driven by any suitable conventional variable speed motor so that air velocity entering the plenum at a low value, as for example 3000 fpm, is controllable to thereby vary the static pressure and, hence, the velocity thereof for accelerating the shot from the nozzle means. Another feature of the present invention is the plurality of conduits making up the gravity feed means, which conduits are arranged in side byside relationship to each other and a baffle means having a deflecting surface associated with each conduit to cause the shot discharging from each conduit to randomly recochet into the guide duct means to thereby effect substantially uniform distribution of shot in the guide duct by utilization of some of the gravitational kinetic energy of the shot. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of an example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the shot peenlng or blasting apparatus according to the present invention Figure 2 is a front elevational view of the upper portion of the shot peening or blasting apparatus of Figure 1 with parts broken away for illustration purposes only Figure 2a is a front elevational view of the lower portion of the apparatus and joined to Figure 2 substantially along line a a shown inFigures 2 and 2a Figure 3 is a side elevational view of the upper portion of the apparatus with parts broken away for illustration purposes only Figure 3a is a side elevational view of the lower portion of the apparatus and joined to Figure 3 along line b b shown in Figures 3 and 3a Figure 4 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 4 4 of Figure 2a, somewhat enlarged, and Figure 5 is a perspective view of the deflector plates forming a component of the apparatus of this invention. Now, referring to the drawingstand more particularly to Figure 1 thereof, the reference number 10 generally designates the shot peening or blasting apparatus according to this invention. The apparatus 10 comprises, in general, a source of shot which may be a supply hopper 12, a gravity shot distribution sub assembly 14, which includes impact means 16 for effecting substantially uniform distribution of shot into a guide duct 18 and nozzle assembly 20 of elongated shape for receiving shot from duct 18 and for discharging the shot to impact against the surface of a workpiece 22. A workpiece support means 24 is provided for supporting the workpiece 22 for shot peening or blasting and such support means 24 may take the form of a roller supported conveyor or merely spaced, parallel rollers 26 or any other suitable supporting and conveying device. Disposed beneath the workpiece support means 24 is a shot collecting hopper 28. The outlet 30 of the hopper 28 is connected to a shot recirculationg system, not shown, of any suitable type such as shown inU.S. Patent No 3,705,511, and US Patent No 2,933,802. The shot recirculation system not shown may include a shot classifying apparatus such as disclosed in the US Patent No 3,421,618. The shot recirculation system is connected to the supply hopper 12 to deliver recirculated shot to the hopper 12 together with new shot which may be added to replace shot rejected by a shot classifier not shown that may form part of the shot recirculation system. The support of the supply hopper 12, gravity shot distribution subassembly 14, nozzle 20 and recovery hopper 28, may be supported on a frame 32, the frame 32 comprising a plurality of vertically extending columns 34 anchored in a foundation 36 and interconnected by joists 38 and a flooring 40 see Figure 3 . The apparatus 10 may at least be partially enclosed by walls 42 attached to the frame 32. Supply Hopper The supply hopper 12, as best shown in Figures 2 and 3, comprises contiguous inclined side walls 44 and inclined front and rear walls 46 which define therebetween an enclosure for retaining a supply of shot. The bottom of the supply hopper 12 is closed by a wall 48. A plurality of spaced, parallel metering outlet valves 50 are supported in the bottom wall 48 to effect initial distribution of shot along the front of the apparatus 10. Each metering outlet valve 50 consists of a tubular outlet conduit 52 and a movable valve member 54 disposed for movement within outlet conduit 52.The valve member 54 is supported at its upper end for linear movement by a bracket 56 secured to the hopper 12. Any suitable mechanism well known in the art may be employed to effect movement of each of the valve members 54 relative to their repsective outlet conduits 52. The flow of shot from each of the outlet metering valves 50 is controlled by a gate 58 which is pivotally secured to side walls 44 of the supply hopper 12. Gate 58 is pivotally movable to and from the closed position shown in full lines in Figures 2 and 3 and the fullspen position shown in broken lines in Figure 3 by a linear motor 60 which may be of the hydraulic of penumatic type. Gravity Shot Distribution Sub assembly The gravity shot distribution sub assembly 14 comprises a plurality of side by side conduits 62, one for each outlet metering valve 50 of the supply hopper 12. Each conduit 62 comprises a funnel shaped inlet member 64, a lower tubular outlet member 66 and an intermediate, flexible, tubular section 68 interconnecting the inlet and outlet members 64,66. Each of the funnel shaped inlet members 64 is supported on a bracket 70 while each of the outlet members 66 is supported on a bracket 72. The brackets 70 and 72 are, respectively, secured to bars 74 and 76 which, in turn, are connected to columns 34 of the frame 32. Each funnel shaped inlet member 62 is disposed in vertical alignment with a metering valve 50 to receive shot released from the latter. The impact means 16 comprises a plurality of deflector plates 78, one for each conduit 62 and disposed in the path of shot discharging from the conduits 62 and between the conduits 62 and guide duct 18. As best shown in Figure 5, each deflector plate 78 is fan shaped in a top plan view and arcuate shaped in cross section so as to provide an upper curved, impact surface 80 against which the falling shot strikes. Each deflector plate 78 has an ear 82 secured to and depending from the underside of the deflector plate. This ear 82 has a bolt hole 83 through which a bolt 84 passes to secure the deflector plate 78 to the distal end portion of a bracket 86, which, in turn, is attached to a bar 88. The bar 88 is similar to bars 74 and 76, secured to vertical columns 34 of frame 32. Each deflector plate 78 is pivotally adjustable on bracket 86 and secured in an adjusted position so that substantially all of the shot, impacting against its surface 80, recochet into the elongated inlet opening 90 of guide duct 18. Guide Duct The guide duct 18, in addition to a canted upper inlet portion 92 which defines the inlet opening 90, comprises vertically supported contiguous walls defining an elongated passageway 94 through which the shot entering inlet opening 90 can free fall. The lower end portion of the guide duct 18 has opposite side wall portions and two opposite wall portions 96 and 97 which converge in a downward direction see Figures 3a and 4 and are connected to nozzle assembly 20. Plenum Assembly A plenum assembly 100 is disposed adjacent the nozzle assembly 20.As best shown in Figures 2a and 4, plenum assembly 100 comprises four continuous vertical walls, a top wall and a bottom wall 102 to define therebetween a chamber 104 into which walls 96 and 98 of the lower portions of guide duct 18 extend. The walls of chamber 104 may be of relatively thin sheet metal reinforced by a plurality of peripherally disposed spaced, parallel ribs 106. The bottom wall 102 has attached thereto two spaced, thick plates 108, The juxtaposed adjacent side 110 of the respective plates 108 are tapered to define therebetween a slot having walls converging in a downward direction. The plates 108 form part of the nozzle assembly 20. As shown in Figure 2a, an air blower 112 is secured, as by bolting, to one of the vertical walls so that the blower outlet is aligned with an opening 114 in that vertical wall see Figure 4 . The air blower 112 is preferably of the variable speed, positive pressure type to provide a variable, relatively low static pressure, as for example of about 2 psi, in chamber 104. Nozzle Assembly The nozzle assembly 20 comprises an inner nozzle section 116 and an outer nozzle section 118. The inner section 116 is connected to the end of guide duct 18 so as to be almost entirely disposed within the chamber 104, while the outer section 118 is disposed exteriorly of the chamber 104 and is connected to the bottom wall 102 by way of the plates 108. The inner nozzle section 116 consists of four continuous walls, with the two opposite, long walls 103 being arranged to converge toward each other in a downward direction to form a relatively narrow, elongated shot outlet 120. The walls of the inner section 116 are so dimensioned that, when the inner section 116 is attached to the guide duct 18, it projects between and in spaced relationship with the sides 110 of the plates 108. Thus, inner nozzle section 116 and sides 110, define therebetween two air slots 122. The outer nozzle section 118 consists of two spaced U shaped plates 124 which are secured to plates 108 and to two opposite end caps 126. The caps 126 are secured to the plates 124 by bolts 128 in flanged ends 130 of the plates 124. To line the passageway between plates 124, wear liners 132 are secured to each of the juxtaposed surfaces of the plates 124 by bolts or screws 134. The wear liners 132 have opposed surfaces so formed that the upper portions are coextensive with surfaces 110 and the lower portions extend in spaced parallel relationship. The nozzle assembly 20 and plenum assembly 100 coact to provide a relatively low static air pressure in the chamber 104, which air is accelerated in passage through the air slots 122 from a relatively low velocity, as for example about 2,000 fpm entering the slots 122 to about 20,W0 fpm upon exiting the slots 122. Since the air exits the slots 122 immediately adjacent to shot outlet 120, the high velocity air entrains the shot exiting from the shot outlet 120 and carries the shot out of the nozzle assembly 20 at a velocity greater than would occur by gravity acceleration of the shot alone. Function of the Shot Peening or Blasting Apparatus In the operation of the apparatus 10 when a workpiece 22 is to be peened or blasted, hopper gate 58 is opened by actuation of the linear motor 60. With the gate 58 in the open position shown in broken lines, shot from the hopper 12 flows through each of the metering valves 50 and into the conduits 14 in the quantities as determined by adjustment of the metering valves 50. The shot falling through conduits 14 discharges at a velocity as eterminedvb gravitational aeeeleeation of the shot on to each of the deflector plates 78 see Figure 2 . The deflector plates 78 by reason of their shape and position utilize the kinetic energy of the falling shot, to provide for random recocheting of the shot into the inlet 90 of the guide duct 18. This random redirection of the shot upon impact with deflector plate 78 effects a substantially uniform distribution of shot across the width of guide duct 18. In guide duct 18, the shot is again accelerated by gravity and is discharged from inner nozzle section 116 through the outlet 120 and is picked up by air at relatively high velocity through and out of the outer nozzle section 118 as was previously described. The shot is driven toward and into impact with the surface of workpiece 22 which may be supported on a conveyor 24 or supported and or conveyed during shot peening by any other suitable means, as for example a table, jig or rail supported table or car. The spent shot is collected in a collecting hopper 28 see Figure 1 and may, as is conventional, be recirculated back to supply hopper 12 by way of an elevator not shown and or to a shot classifying system not shown . The velocity at which the shot is emitted from nozzle assembly 20 may be varied commensurate with the desired impact force with which the shot is to strike the workpiece. Obviously, workpieces 22 of different material may require different shot impact force. This ability to control the velocity of the discharging shot is accomplished by adjustment of the size of slots 122 to provide optimum performance and, since velocity is a function of air volume entering chamber 104 of plenum assembly 100, via air blower 112, by varying the speed of blower 112, the air velocity discharging from slots 122 can be adjusted and hence, the acceleration of the shot through and out of the nozzle assembly 20 can be varied. It is now believed readily apparent from the foregoing description that the present invention provides a shot peening or blasting apparatus 10 which can be of smaller overall size than a similar apparatus which relies solely on gravitational acceleration of the shot to provide the desired impact force of the shot against a workpiece. It is an apparatus which has a wide range of utility since the impact force of the shot can be quickly and easily varied for different peening or blasting operations and workpiece materials. It is an apparatus which by reason of utilizing the force of gravity and low pressure air is less costly to operate than the conventional shot peening apparatuses which utilize a multiplicity of energy consuming high pressure nozzles and or centrifugal throwing wheels. Although but one embodimnt of the invention has been illustrated and described in details it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Various changes can be made in the arrangement of parts without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
