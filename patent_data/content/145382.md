# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO AXIAL SWIRL GENERATORS

## Abstract
The invention provides a burner that may be mounted at the wall 2 of a furnace. A mixture of pulverised fuel and primary air is discharged through a duct 4 and secondary air is discharged through a duct 8 . The duct 8 includes a portion 16 that is convergent in the direction of flow. The convergent portion 16 houses a unit in the form of two concentric rings 22 and 23 between which are connected swirl inducing vanes 21 . The unit can be moved between a forward position in which secondary air can pass only between the vanes and a retracted position in which part of the secondary air can flow between the vanes and part can flow as an envelope around the unit.
