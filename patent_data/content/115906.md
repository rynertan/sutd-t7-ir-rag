# Servo valve for ultra fast pressure regulation with controller system damping.

## Abstract
A liquid flow control servo valve where the flow controlling element is a magnetically loaded hydrostatic step bearing. An electromagnet has a central liquid passage 3 through it. Flow from this passage 3 is closed off by a magnetically permeable flat plate. This plate has a planar surface matching a cor responding planar surface of the electromagnet. Pressure from passage 3 floats the plate on a thin liquid film in the manner of a hydrostatic step bearing. This film thickness of this liquid film rapidly adjusts until the hydrostatic bearing pressure force W balances the magnetic forces on the plate. This variation in film thickness adjusts flow rate past the plate. The flow and pres sure drop across the hydrostatic bearing plate rapidly adjusts to coil current in the low hysteresis electromagnet, so that Î”P across the plate varies nearly in proportion to coil current I. The geometry of the hydrostatic bearing can be tailored to produce a wide range of viscous damping characterizations using conventional squeeze film equations. So long as flow in the step bearing is laminar, the ratio of critical damping produced by the valve in a particular installation is invariant over a wide operating range of flows and fluid viscosities.
