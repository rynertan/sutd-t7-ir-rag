# Apparatus for setting a well tool in a well bore.

## Abstract
Apparatus for setting in a well bore a well tool such as a packer, the well tool having expandable anchor means for anchoring it in a well bore, a conduit to permit flow through the tool, and a slidable valve positioned in the conduit having an open lower position and a closed upper position, the apparatus comprising inner 52, 66, 80 and outer 20, 40, 88 tubular portions telescopically interengaged, with the inner portion receiving a slidable mandrel 186 . In use, the tool is connected to the inner sleeve by a shearable tension collar 182 , the mandrel passing through the collar and into the tool conduit for engagement with the valve. Annular pistons 58, 76 185 are provided between the inner and outer sleeves and, preferably, between the mandrel and the inner sleeve. A flapper valve 130 is preferably pivotally attached on one side to the inner sleeve for sealing the top of the mandrel. Pressurization of the inner sleeve via tubing string from which the apparatus is suspended pressurizes the annular spaces beneath the pistons thus forcing the inner sleeve as well as the mandrel upwardly to set the tool. Such upward movement of the inner sleeve breaks a seal at the lower end thereof to permit depressurization of the annular space below the mandrel piston which forces the mandrel downwardly. A lock ring 170 is preferably provided to lock the mandrel in its lower position to permit further operation of the valve with the mandrel.
