# Copper base spinodal alloy strip and process for its preparation.

## Abstract
Copper base spinodal alloy strip of good strength and ductility is provided, the alloy containing 5 to 35 percent nickel, 7 to 13 percent tin, balance essentially copper, and having an unaged microstructure characterized by an equiaxed grain structure of substantially all alpha, face centered cubic phase with a substantially uniform dispersed concentration of tin and a substantial absence of tin segrega tion. The strip is prepared from copper alloy powder of the indicated composition by a process comprising the steps of compaction, sintering, cooling, rolling and annealing. The strip after aging may contain up to about 50 percent alpha plus gamma phase.
