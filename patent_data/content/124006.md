# Electrode drive and nozzle system for an automatic air carbon arc cutting and gouging torch.

## Abstract
An automatic air carbon arc cutting and gouging torch 10 having a fixed drive wheel 34 for moving an electrode 35 through an insulated housing 12 and through a nozzle 120 adapted to conduct air in a semicircular pattern along the electrode 35 . Electrical current is supplied to the elec trode 35 through an contact shoe 70 supported by and bi ased to the electrode 35 by a lever arm 82 , the shoe 70 causing the electrode 35 to frictionaliy engage the drive wheel 34 . Alternately idler rollers can be used in combination with the contact shoe to position the electrode for movement by the drive wheel. Means 116 are included to reposition the electrode in the event of electrode stub out .
