A watertight slide fastener 10 comprises a resilient bifurcated seal member 28 mounted on opposite stringer tapes 12, 12 adjacent to one end of a pair of rows of coupling elements 13, 13 and snugly receivable in a Y shaped guide channel in a slider body. The seal member 28 has a pair of resilient tongues 29, 30 extending from said one end of the rows of coupling elements 13 along opposed inner longitudinal edges of the stringer tapes 12, 12 and a head 31 interconnecting the tongues 29, 30 at their front end so as to define therebetween a first opening 32 toward said one end of the rows of coupling elements 13 and snugly receivable therein a neck 25 of the slider body when the slider 22 is in its uppermost position. The tongues 29, 30 have outer sidewalls 35, 35 sealingly engageable with side flanges 27, 27 of the slider body and opposed inner sidewalls 34, 34 sealingly engageable together when the slider 22 is in the uppermost position.
