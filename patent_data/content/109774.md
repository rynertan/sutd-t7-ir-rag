# Process for regeneration of iron antimony metallic oxide catalysts.

## Abstract
Iron antimony metallic oxide catalysts which have be come deactivated after being used for the production of aldehydes, acids, nitriles, or dienes through oxidation, ammoxidation, or oxidative dehydrogenation of organic compounds in fluidized bed reactors are regenerated by adding to the catalyst a solid molybdenum component which is volatile or capable of forming a volatile compound under reaction conditions. The metallic oxide catalysts contain as essential components I Fe, II Sb, III at least one element selected from the group consisting of V, Mo, and W, and IV Te.
