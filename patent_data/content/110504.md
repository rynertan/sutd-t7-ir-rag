# Beam direct converter.

## Abstract
A beam direct converter recovers the energy of incom ing ion particles intermingled with neutral particles. An angular cylindrical collector 40 of the direct converter has its lengthwise side substantially aligned with the flowing di rection of a beam of neutral particles. Angular cylindrical suppressors 30, 50 are provided upstream and down stream of the collector as viewed from the flowing direction of the beam of neutral particles. The collector 40 is set at a positive potential to decelerate ion particles taken into the collector. Suppressors 30, 50 set at a negative potential prevent electrons produced outside of the direct converter from being carried into the collector 40 . A plurality of con ductive pipes 78 are embedded in the suppressor 30 . When the conductive pipes 78 are supplied with current running in the same direction, a magnetic field B acting in parallel with the plane of the suppressor envelops it. When, therefore, ion particles enter the suppressor 30 with the emission of secondary electrons, it is possible to confine the secondary electrons in the magnetic field B, thereby preventing them from being carried into the collector 40 .
