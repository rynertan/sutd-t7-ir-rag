# Angle repeater means for converting shaft rotation into representative pulsed signals.

## Abstract
The invention includes an optical pulse forming switch 30 interfaced with a pair of synchronised flip flops and a phase detection and counter control circuit 39 which senses rotation extent and direction. The counter control circuit 39 drives a counter 10 that stores the number of passed angular increments and stores direction of rotation, the counter 10 being interrogated and reset at regular time intervals. Thus, the input shaft rotation is converted into a digital quantity by maintaining a running summation of counter values. The operator reference indicator 1 is accordingly brought up to date following each input conver sion.
