# Exercise apparatus.

## Abstract
Exercise apparatus comprises a knuckle joint 3 incor porating connectors 4, 5 from which extend the arms 1, 2 of the apparatus. The knuckle joint 3 comprises two housings each accommodating two resilient masses 55 in arcuate channels 12, 13 . Relative angular movement of the arms 1, 2 about the axis of the knuckle joint compresses the masses 55 by means of arcuate wall portions 22, 23 located in the channels. Each connector is releasably coupled by a pin 47 or pawl 96 to a part of one housing and by releasing the coupling the arm extending from the connector can be rotated about the housing axis without compressing the resilient mass.
