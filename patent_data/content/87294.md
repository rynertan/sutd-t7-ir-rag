## Description
RADIATION STABILIZATION OF POLYMERIC MATERIALThe present invention relates generally to semicrystalline polymers which are suitable for stabilization by irradiation sterilization. More particularly, the present invention relates to additives for semi crystalline polymers, such as propylene polymer ccmpositions, to improve the properties of the polymer when subject to irradiation.Semi crystalline polymeric materials, such as polypropylene, are often employed in articles where it is necessary to subject the article to irradiation sterilization. The polymeric material without additives is subject, however, to degradation, embrittlement and discolouration during or subsequentto such irradiation. Many additives have been proposed for such semi crystalline polymeric materials to inhibit the discolouration and degradation resulting from the irradiation sterilization treatment. US Patent 4,100,185, for example, discloses irradiation sterilization of semi crystalline polymers wherein the semi crystalline polymer has incorporated therein a non crystalline mobilizing additive which increases the free volume of the polymer thereby to prevent embrittlement of the polymer during and subsequent to the irradiation.United States Patent 4,274,932 is directed to a process for sterilizing a semi crystalline polymer which process includes the steps,of subjecting a semi crystalline polymer to a sterilizing amount of high energy irradiation. The semi crystalline polymer has a specific crystalline content of from 20 to 90 and the ratio of the weight average molecular weight to the number average molecular weight is no greater than 9.The polymer, furthermore, has incorporated therein a mobilizing amount of a non crystalline liquid mobilizing additive which increases the free volume of the polymer and retains the flexibility thereof.United States Patent 3,940,325 is directed to radiation sterilized shaped articles of olefin polymers. The polymers contain from 0.01 to 0.5 per cent by weight based on the weight of the oleo in polymer of octadecyl 3,5 di t butyl r hydroxyghydrocinnamate and or tetrakis methane.United States Patent 3,537,967 is directed to a radiation sterilized article having improved colour which is manufactured from a polypropylene polymer with a substantial crystalline content which has added to it up to one per cent of an ester of thiodipropionic acid as a stabilizer.European Patent Application 79301347.5, Specification 7736, is directed to polyolefin articles, especially polypropylene hypodermic syringes, which are made more resistant to the yellow discolouration and embrittlement which accompanies sterilization by gamma irradiation.Resistance is imparted by the addition to the polyolefin of a heterocyclic hindered amine.While the prior art , as outline above, disclosed many efforts to provide an additive to stabilize semicrystalline polymers to prevent discolouration and degradation when subjected to irradiation sterilization, the problem persists for semi crystalline polymers used in medical articles. The present invention is directed to an improvement in the irradiation sterilization of a semi crystalline polymer by incorporatng with the polymer a combination of stabilizing agent comprising a hindered amine and a mobilizing additive.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided a semi crystalline polymer which has incorporated therein a combination of stabilizing agents comprising a heterocyclic hindered amine and a non crystalline mobilizing addiitive. It has been found that the combination of a mobilizing additive and a heterocyclic hindered amine incorporated into a semi crystalline polymer provides a synergistic improvement in the irradiation stability of such polymers.Accordingly, such semi crystalline polymers having a combination stabilizer including a non crystalline mobilizing additive and a heterocyclic hindered amine when subjected to sterilizing irradiation has increased stability to embrittlement and to discolouration during and subsequent to such irradiation.The non crystalline mobilizing additive is a low molecular weight substance which is miscible with the polymeric material and is also compatible therewith.The mobilizing additive is a substance which increases the free volume of the polymer, and therefore, also lowers the density of the polymer.The mobilizing additive can be any one of a wide variety of liquids which increase the total free volume of the polymer. The term 1liquid , as used herein, includes highly viscous substances, commonly referred to as greases. In general, such mobilizing additives have a density of from 0.6 to l.9g cm3 and preferably from 3 0.6 to l.lg cm . The mobilizing additive has a low molecular weight, with the average molecular weight being on the order of from about 100 to about 10,000 grams mole and preferably from about 100 to about 5,000 grams mole. Representative examples of suitable mobilizing additives include hydrocarbon oils, halogenated hydrocarbon oils, phthalicester oils, vegetable oils, silicon oils, low molecular weight non crystallne polymer greases, such as hydrocarbon polymer greases, low molecular weight polyester greases, polyarylether greases, etc. The preferred mobilizer is a liquid mobilizer which is not highly viscous, in particular a hydrocarbon oil or phthalicester oil.The mobilizing additive is incorporated into the polymer in a mobilizing amount. The mobilizing additive is generally present in an amount of from about 0.01 per cent to about 50 per cent by weight of the polymer and preferably from about 0.1 per cent to about 20 per cent. All percentages used herein are by weight and are based on the weight of semi crystalline polymers unless expressly designated otherwise.The hindered amines preferably comprise a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring containing the hindered amine nitrogen and optionally another hetero atom preferably nitrogen or oxygen. If the hindered amine is a tertiary amine, the tertiary group may be, for example, an alkyl, aralkyl, alkaryl or alicyclic group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms. One or more of the substituents of the hindered amine may itself be a hindered amine so that the tertiary group may be used to link a plurality of hindered amines. The hindering groups are preferably alkyl groups containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms and most preferably all four groups are methyl. The most preferred hindered amines comprise 2,2,4,4 tetramethyl piperidine derivatives.The hindered amine is preferably bonded to a carrier moiety which should have little if any inhibiting effect on the chemical activity of the hindered amine. Reasonably inert carriers include aromatic compounds for example those based on the benzene, imidazole or triazine rings , saturated hydrocarbon compounds, esters or amides of carboxylic acids, ketones and ether, thioether, sulphinyl or sulphone groups. Preferably, the carriers can be used to link together a plurality of hindered amines and hence the tertiary groups may be regarded as carriers too.Exampies of hindered amines linked by diesters or ketones include a di 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl sebacate see formula I where it is the sebacate which is the carrier b di 2,2,6,6 ,tetramethyl 4 piperidyl 1 3,5 diter tiarybutyl 4 hydroxyphenylmethyl 1,1 pentanedicarboxylate see formula II where it is the pentanedicarboxylate which is the carrier c the condensate of succinic acid and N 2 hydroxy propyl 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 hydroxypiperidine see formula III where both the succinate moiety and the tertiary propoxy groups combine to form carriers the condensate preferably contains 6 to 20 hindered amine groups , and d l,4 di 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl 2,3 butane dione see formula IV where it is the butanedione which is the carrier. EMI8.1 The semi crystalline polymer can be, for example, a homopolymer of ethylene low or high density polyethylene , propylene, butene l or 4 methylpentene l or a copolymer of two or more of these monomers.Preferred copolymers are copolymers of propylene and from 7 to 20 per cent by weight of the copolymer of ethylene, when made by injecting ethylene into the latter stages of an otherwise homopolymerization of propylene, or from 0.5 to 10 per cent of ethylene when made by random copolymerization. Copolymers of ethylene with up to 30 per cent of vinyl acetate, methyl, ethyl or butyl including tertiary butyl acrylate or methacrylates or acrylic or methacrylic acids may also be used. The preferred semi crystalline polymer is polypropylene having specific crystalline content of from 20 to 90 per cent.The composition may contain stabilizing amounts eg, 0.01 to 2 per cent by weght of the polymer of light stabilizers eg benzotriazoles and or phenolic antioxidants of the kind used in polyolefins, for example, n octadecyl 3 e,5 ditertiarybutyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate. However, phenolic antioxidants may aggravate discolouration so their use may entail sacrifice of some of the improvement in discolouration.The compositions may also contain stabilizing amounts of sulphur compounds of the type known to synergise with phenolic antioxidants in polyolefins, for example, long chain eg C10 to C22 mercaptans and sulphides but the preferred compounds are dialkyl thiodialkanoates especialy when the alkyl groups contain from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. The use of some of such sulphur compounds reduces the synergistic effect of the combination of stabilizing agents of the present invention. The compositions preferably contain from 0.01 to 10 per cent usally 0.1 to 0.5 per cent by weight of organic sulphur compound. Other conventional additives such as pigments or moulding aids may be used.The heterocyclic hindered amine is added to the semi crystalline polymer at a level of from about 0.005 to about 0.5 per cent by weight of the polymer, preferably from about 0.5 per cent to about 0.3 per cent. It has furthermore been determined that the weight ratio of the non crystalline mobilizing additives to the heterocyclic hindered amine should be from about 0.5 to about 20, preferably from about 2 to about 10.While not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the mobilizing addictive functions to mobilize the amorphous portion of the polymer while at the same time the presence of the hindered amine captures radicals in the accessible portions of the polymer. The net effect is believed to be that the mobilizing additive increases the radical termination reaction and prevents these reactions from affecting the bulk portion of the polymer to prevent or minimize degradation and discolouration subsequent to the irradiation. Also, the mobilizing additive aids the hindered amine in capturing radicals formed during the irradiation of the polymer.Further feature of the present invention are illustrated by the following Example. Reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a plot of irradiation breadkdown with time at various levels of irradiation for a polymer having only a hindered amine present as a stabilizer.Figure 2 is a plot of irradiatin breakdown with time at various levels of irradiation for a polymer having only a mobilizing additive present as a stabilizerFigure 3 is a plot of irradiation breakdown with time at various levels of irradiation for a polymer having a combination of a hindered amine and a mobilizing additive present as a stabilizer.Figure 4 is an irradiation breakdown at various levels of irradiation for a polymer containing the combination of stablizing agents of the invention and also containing a commonly used sulphur compound, dilaurylthiodipropionate DLTDP . ExamplePolypropylene containing 0.1 hindered amine formula I and having a melt flow of 12 and a ratio of weight to number average molecular weight mw mn of 2.8 was irradiated with 2, 3, 5, and 7 megarads of gamma radiation Co60 . Immediately following irradiation, the sample was brittle and continued to embrittle with age as shown in Figure 1.In a separate experiment, 4.78 of a mobilizing additive hydrocarbon oil manufactured by Witco Company and identified by the trade name WITCO 300 was added to the polypropylene without the addition of hindered amine.In this case, an improvement in irradiation stability over the polypropylene with hindered amine alone was observed as shown in Figure 2 where embrittlement was measured after 5 megarads.A dramatic improvement in irradiation stability was observed, however, when the 0.1 hindered amine formulaI and 4.7 mobilizing additive WITCO 300 hydrocarbon oil were added to the polypropylene as shown in Figure 3. In this case, the stabilized polypropylene could withstand 7 megarads without embrittlement even after 9 months of aging following irradiatin. In addition, the samples contained mobilizing additive and hindered amine did not discolour with irradiation. Thus, the combination of hindered amine with mobilizing additive produced an outstanding irradiation stabilizer package for polypropylene as disclosed herein.The addition of thioester dilaurylthiodipropionate to the polypropylene containing hindered amine 0.1 formula. I and mobilizing additive 4.7 WTICO 300 hydrocarbon oil produced a negative effect as shown inFigure 4. It is therefore recommended that this commonly used thioester not be used in the presence of the combination of stabilizing agents of the ivention due to the strong antagonistic effect which it has on polymer stability.
