# A semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
In a MOS dRAM formed by integrating memory cells each formed of an MOS capacitor 2 and an MOSFET 1 , a D type transistor with a threshold voltage lower than that of MOSFETs of peripheral circuits is used for the MOSFET 1 of each memory cell. Thus, a word line driver without a pull up circuit can be used, permitting high speed access of the MOS dRAM.
