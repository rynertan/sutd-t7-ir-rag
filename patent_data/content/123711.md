## Description
POLYVINYL CHLORIDE COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIQN 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a polyvinyl chloride composition having improved processability, high clarity, and high heat distortion temperature.2. Description of the Prior Art Polyvinyl chloride is in general use owing to its outstanding chemical and physical properties. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily satisfactory in heat stability and impact strength, and it requires improvement in processability and heat distortion temperature. In order to overcome these disadvantages, there have been proposed.several means including the addition of stabilizers, plasticizers, lubricants , and other chemicals. Improvement through polymer blend is also commonly practiced. Polymer blend accelerates gelation in the molding process of polyvinyl chloride, permits deep drawing of moldings, and improves the heat distortion temperature of moldings. In Japanese Patent Publication No. 53ii i65 there is disclosed a polymer consisting mainly of methyl meth acrylate which is claimed to accelerate the gelation of polyvinyl chloride and improve the processability so as to increase elongation at high temperatures. According to this disclosure, the polymer should have a specific viscosity sp higher than 3 1. g lOOO ml chloroform, 200C . One to three parts of this polymer are added to 100 parts of polyvinyl chloride to greatly improve the processability in rolling and to give good sheet moldings.However, it was found that if this polymer is added in large quantities7 for example 5. to 10 parts, the resulting blend becomes extremely viscous in melt flow, with the result that the mixing resistance increases and the molding is very difficult to perform. Moreover,under the process the moldings are tinged with a yellow color, and a remarkable shrinkage of moldings also occrrs. In Japanese Patent Publication No. 298S5 1976 there is disclosed the incorporation of polyvinyl chloride with a methyl methacrylate d methyIstyrene copolymer.This blending improves the heat distortion temperature of polyvinyl chloride, but has a serious drawback in that ungelled particles occur in large numbers in the sheet extruded from the blend., Moreover, due to the knack of lubrication on the roll mill, the blend is liable to stick to the screw, die, and calendering rolls, making continued operation difficuIt. These disavantages are pronounced when high speed molding is carried out at a high molding temperature. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a new polyvinyl chloride composition having high clarity, high heat distortion temperature, improved processability such as elongation at high temperatures and deep drawing, improved release from roll mill, and improved extrudability. The gist of the invention resides in a polyvinyl chloride composition which comprises I 99 to 30 parts by weight, the same shall apply hereunder of polyvinyl chloride or a vinyl chloride copolymer in which at least 80 by weight, the same shall apply hereunder is vinyl chloride, and II 1 to 70 parts of a polymer which is obtained by polymerizing B 1 to 30 of a mixture com posed of 40 to 80 of styrene monomer and 60 to 20 of alkyl ester of acrylic acid or alkyl ester of methacrylic acid said alkyl group having 2 to 18 carbon atoms , in the presence of A 99 to 70 of methyl methacrylate polymer or of a copolymer . of more than 75 of methyl methacrylate and less than 25 of styrene monomer, said polymer or copolymer having a specific viscosity sp, C 0.4 g 100 ml benzene, 300C lower than 0.6 said polyvinyl chloride composition having improved processability, high.clarity, and high heat distortion temperature. BRIEF.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING In the drawing, the single figure is a graph showing the relationship between elongation and temperature measured for sheets produced from the polyvinyl chloride compositions prepared from sample a in Example 1 and samples l and in the Comparative Examples. Reference number l denotes sample a in Example I, and Reference numbers 2 and 3 denote sample 11 and sample 1 in the Comparative Examples, respectively. The test pieces were prepared according to JIS K6734 and measurements were carried out at a pulling rate of 200 itirn min. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The. polyvinyl chloride I used in this invention is polyvinyl chloride or vinyl chloride copolymer in which at least 80 is vinyl chloride. Examples of the copolymer include vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, vinyl chloride alkyl vinyl ether copolymer, vinyl chloride ethylene copolymer, and vinyl chloridepropylene copolymer. These polymers may be produced by emulsion polymerization, suspension polymerization, bulk. polymerization, and other methods. The polymer 11 is added for the improvement of processability, elongation at high temperature, and heat distortion temperature, in an amount of I to 70 parts, preferably 5 to 50 parts,. for 99 to 30 parts of the polyvinyl chloride. If the quantity is less than 1 part, the improvement of the vinyl chloride in processability and heat distortion temperature is not sufficient. If the quantity exceeds 70 parts, the resulting composition is greatly improved in heat distortion temperature but the toughness and other properties of polyvinyl chloride are reduced. The polymer II is composed of a comparatively hard polymer component A consisting mainly of methyl methacrylate, and a comparatively soft copolymer component B consisting of alkyl ester of acrylic acid or alkyl ester of methacrylic acid and styrene monomer, the latter copolymer being effective in preventing the formation of ungelled particles and the sticking of the resin composition to metal surfaces. The adequate quantities of component A and component B are 99 to 70 and 1 to 30 , respectively. If the quantity of component A is less than 70 , the resulting composition is not improved in heat distortion temperature, although it does not stick to metal surfaces nor forms ungelled particles which are often found in extruded sheets. On the other hand, if component A exceeds 99 and component B is less than 1 , the resulting composition is poor in releasability, although it is improved in heat distortion temperature and elongation at high temperature. In such a case, the resulting composition sticks to the calendering rolls and the extrusion screw and die1 making it difficult to carry out molding continuously for a long time. A large number of ungelled particles appear on the molded sheet to impair the clarity and surface smoothness of the sheet. In order to improve polyvinyl chloride in clarity, elongation at high temperatures, and heat distortion tem perature, the polymer for blending should be highly miscible with polyvinyl chloride. Component A used in this invention is characteristic for being highly miscible with polyvinyl chloride. Methyl methacrylate polymer or a copolymer of more than 75 preferably more than 85 of methyl methacrylate and less than 25 preferably less than 15 of styrene monomer is highly miscible with polyvinyl chloride. However, the copolymer becomes poor in compatibility with polyvinyl chloride when the content of methyl methacrylate is less than 75 and that of styrene is more than 258, Therefore, the resulting composition is not satisfactory in clarity, elongation at high temperature, and heat distortion tem perature. The styrene monomer includes, for example, styrene, i methylstyrene and other substituted styrenes and o methylstyrene, p tert butylstyrene, chiorostyrene, and other nucleus substituted styrene.They are used individually or in combination. In order to achieve improved performance, increased flowability, and reduced molding shrinkage of the resulting composition, it is necessary that component A shouldXhave a specific viscosity lower than 0.6, preferably less than 0.3. If it has a specific viscosity higher than 0.6, the resulting composition is poor in flowability due to increased melt viscosity, which leads to increased mixing to sue and poor moldability. Therefore, such a component can only be added in a limited quantity.If a polymer having a specific viscosity higher than h.6 is added in large quantities, the resulting composition suffers from molding shrinkage and poor appearance. The methyl methacrylate polymer as a major constituent of component A is in essence highly sticky to metal surfaces. Therefore, if component A alone is added to polyvinyl chloride, the resulting composition is improved in heat distortion temperature and fabricability such as elongation at high temperature, but it is sticky to the rollers, screw, and die. This hinders continuous sheet molding operation. In addition, the resulting composition gives rise to a large number of ungelled particles that impair the gloss and clarity of sheet.Presumably, this is because polymer component A has a high softening point and does not melt completely at the molding temperature of polyvinyl chloride. Component B is effectivein solving the problems involved in molding and fabrication. Component B is a mixture of 60 to 20 of alkyl ester of acrylic acid or alkyl ester of methacrylic acid and 40 to 80 of styrene monomer. If the content of styrene monomer is more than 80 , component B is poor in the effect of preventing sticking, and the resulting composition is poor in clarity.Similarly7 if the content of alkyl ester of acrylic acid or alkyl ester of methacrylic acid is more than 60 , the resulting composition is poor in clarity. One kind or more than one kind of alkyl esters of acrylic acid or alkyl esters of meth acrylic asia is used, the. alkyl esters having 2 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. The styrene monomer includes styrene and substituted styrene. It is important that the polymerization of component Br be carried out in the presence of a polymerization latex of component A .This is a principal feature of this invention. After polymerization of component A the monomer mixture of component B is added and polymerized. The polymer of component A , which is comparatively hard, is covered, entirely or partly, with the polymer of component B , which is comparatively soft. The resulting polymer flows easily during molding and fabrication. It is considered that this is one of the reasons why the dis person in polyvinyl chloride is improved and ungelled particles do not occur in the molded sheet. If a polymer resulting from uniform mixing of the monomers of component A and the monomers of component B is blended with polyvinyl chloride, no improvement is made in heat distortion temperature as shown in the Example. On the other hand, if polymer component A and polymer component B are polymerized separately and then blended with polyvinyl chloride, prevention of ungelled particles in extrusion molding is not satisfactory, although improvement is made in heat distortion temperature, elongation at high temperature, fabricability, and sticking to metal surfaces.In the case where component A is polymerized in the the presence of polymer of component B , no satisfactory results are obtained. In the case where polymer of component A and polymer of component B are added in the form of dry powder to polyvinyl chloride, the resulting composition provides molded sheet containing a large number of ungelled particles. According to this invention, it is essential that component B be polymerized in the presence of the polymer of component A . When this method is employed, the resulting polyvinyl chloride composition has improved processability, easy release from roll mill, excellent clarity, high heat distortion temperature, and large elongation at high temperature. The polymer mixture should preferably be prepared by emulsion polymerization, in which a common emulsifiery a water soluble . or oil soluble redox type polymerization initiator , and a proper chain transfer agent are used. The reaction product in the form of a latex is coagulated, washed, dehydrated and dried and thereby formed into a powder resin. The polymer mixture may be mixed with polyvinyl chloride in any commonly used manner. The resulting polyvinyl chloride composition may be incorporated with stabilizers, lubricants, colorants, fillers, etc., which are commonly used for polyvinyl chloride, or it is used for molding without such additives. In addition, the polyvinyl chloride composition of this invention may be blended with an impact modifier to impart impact resistance. The invention is now described with reference to the following examples. EXAMPLE 1. and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES Into a reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer and reflux condenser were charged the following materials. Distilled water 300 parts Dioctylsulfosuccinic ester sodium salt 3.0 Sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate 0.5 part Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate 0.01 Ferrous sulfate Q.D05 The atmosphere in the reactor was replaced with nitrogen gas, and the reactor was heated to 60QC. To the reactor was added dropwise a mixture composed of 72 parts of methyl methacrylate, 8 parts of i methyl styrene, 0.16 part of tert dodecylmercaptan, and 0.4 part of cumene hydroperoxide, whereby a polymer latex of component A was obtained.Thereafter, to the reactor was added dropwise for polymerization a mixture of component B composed of 8 parts of n butyl acrylate, 12 parts of styrene, 0.1 part of tert dodecylmercaptan, and 0.1 part of cumene hydroperoxide. After addition of antioxidant, the resulting polymer latex was subjected to salting out, filtration, washing, and drying, whereby sample a as shown inTable 1 was obtained in the form of powdery polymer. Using the same reaction vessel as above, polymers of different compositions were prepared from component A methyl methacrylate and alpha methylstyrene and component B n butyl acrylate and styrene in the ratios as shown in Table 1. Twenty parts of the polymer II thus obtained was mixed with 100 parts of polyvinyl chloride I , 2.5 parts of dibutyitin mercaptide stabilizer, and 0.5 part of lubri cant., for 5 minutes on a roll mill heated to 180 C. The sheet prepared by this roll mill was then pressed at 1900C under 50 kg cm2 for 15 minutes. Test pieces were punched out from the pressed sheet, and their physical properties were measured. The results are shown in Table 2. In Comparative Example 11 , polyvinyl chloride alone without the polymer was processed. It is to be noted that the compositions in samples a , b , and c of this invention, in which 20 parts of the polymer was blended, are 6 to 70C higher in Vicat softening point than the polyvinyl chloride inComparative Example 11 , and yet are comparable to the polyvinyl chloride in clarity and izod impact strength. In Comparative Example 1 in which component A was composed of methyl methacrylate and alpha methylstyrene at a ratio of 70 to 30, the resulting composition was improved only a little in Vicat softening point 81 C and greatly decreased in light transmittance. In Comparative Examples 2 and 3 , in which the content of n butyl acrylate in component B was 90 and 10 , respectively, the resulting compositions were poor in clarity and high in haze. In Comparative Example 4 , in which the polyvinyl chloride composition was identical in its composition with that of sample a , the resulting composition was not improved in Vicat softening point because components A and B were uniformly mixed and polymerized. In Comparative Example 7 , in which component B in polymer II was as high as 40 , the resulting poly vinyl chloride composition was improved only a little inVicat softening point. Polyvinyl chloride compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 5 , 6 , 8 9 , and 10 were improved in Vicat softening point and light transmittance, but were not satisfactory in processability and appearance of moldings.. More details are given in the followingExamples 2 and 3. It is noted that only the compositions of samples a , b , and c are improved in heat distortion tem perature with no loss of the outstanding clarity of polyvinyl chloride. EXAMPLE 2 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES In Comparative Example 5 , component B was omitted.In Comparative Example 6 , the chain transfer agent was reduced to increase the specific viscosity Qsp of the polymer. In Comparative Example 8 , component B was polymerized first and then component A was polymerized, with the same monomer composition to the case of sample a . In Comparative Example 9 , components A and B were polymerized separately and the resulting latices were blended to give the polymer mixture. InComparative Example 10 , components A and B were polymerized separately and the resulting powdery polymers were mixed. Polyvinyl chloride compositions were prepared by blending 100 parts of polyvinyl chloride having a degree of polymerization of 6803 with 20 parts of the polymer prepared in the above mentioned ComparativeExamples or samples a and b , 2.5 parts of butyltin mercaptide stabilizer, and 0.5 part of lubcant Blending was carried out at 1100C using a high speed blender. The resulting polyvinyl chloride compositions were subjected to the following tests.1. Sheet extrusion molding The composition was extruded into a 0,25 mm thick sheet using a single screw extruder having a screw diameter of 50 mm, a screw compression ratio of 1 3, and an L D ratio of 22, with a coat hanger die. The appearance of the sheet was observed.2. Roll mixing test The composition was subjected to roll milling at 2050C roll surface temperature3 and at 20 rpm using an 8 inch roll mill. During roll milling, the composition was removed from the roll mill at proper intervals so as to measure the time for the composition to stick to the roll surface. The appearance of the rolled sheet was observed.3. Brabender mixing test In the chamber of a Brabender Plasti Corder was placed 55 g of the polyvinyl chloride composition, and mixing was started after 3 minute preheating and torque was measured at a rotor speed of 45 rpm and at a chamber temperature of 1800C. The results are shown in Table 3. In Comparative Example 55, in which component B was omitted, the resulting polyvinyl chloride composition gave a hazy rough surface sheet having a large number of ungelled particles, although it had a high Vicat softening point as shown in Table 2. In Comparative Example 6 , in which component A had a specific viscosity higher than the limit specified in this invention, the resulting composition gave very high mixing torque as shown in the Brabender mixing test. Therefore, the composition could not be extruded into a sheet. In addition, the composition was non sticking in the roll mixing test, but suffered from such an extremely high shrinkage that any sheet of desired thickness was not obtained and the appearance of the sheet was unsatisfactory.In comparative Examples 8 , 9 , and 10 , the polyvinyl chloride composition was prepared in the same composition as in sample a but the polymerization was carried out in a different way. The resulting compositions were all as good in release from roll mill, apeaance of rolled sheet, and .mixing torque as the one in sample a . However, they resulted in ungelled particles in an extruded sheet. EXAMPLE 3 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES The polyvinyl chloride compositions obtained in sample a and Comparative Example 1 and polyvinyl chloride alone Comparative Example 11 were formed into sheets using a roll mill, and the sheets were pressed at 1900C, under 50 kg cm2, for 5 minutes to give 0.5 mm thick sheets. Test pieces were prepared according to JIS R6734, and they were subjected to tensile test at 60 to 1200C to measure the elongation at high temperatures.The results are shown in the accompanying drawing. It should be noted that the composition of Comparative Example 1 is poorer in elongation at any temperature than polyvinyl chloride alone in Comparative Example 11 , whereas the composition of sample a was greatly improved in elongation at 1000,C, 1100C, and 1200C.
