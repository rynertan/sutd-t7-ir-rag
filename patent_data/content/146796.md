# PROCESS FOR THE FABRICATION OF THIN FILM MAGNETIC TRANSDUCER GAPS BY LIFT OFF

## Abstract
Process for lift off fabrication of sputtered dielectric or nonmagnetic gap materials and thin film heads for either a single element thin film head or side by side elements on a thin film head. The lift off process comprises depositing a metallization layer 16 over a substrate 12 and a magnetic material 14 . A back gap area 20 is opened through photoresist 18 . Copper 22 is electroplated and the photo resist 18 is removed. Exposed metallization layer 16 is sputter etched and a dielectric or non magnetic gap material 24, 26 is sputtered. Finally, copper 22 is etched away with a solution of 20 of ammonium persulfate having a pH in the range of 7 to 9. The process can also be utilized to obtain a multiple layer deposits on a single thin film head by repeating the steps of the process. The process provides for a clean hole, no dielectric on the surface nor any attacking on the magnetic material.
