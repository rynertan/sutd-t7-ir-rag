# Cyclic process for the preparation and processing of a hydroxylammonium salt solution.

## Abstract
The process relates to hydroxylammonium salts. Cyclic process for the preparation and processing of a hydroxylammonium salt solution, in which an aqueous acid reaction medium is kept in circulation between a hydroxylammonium salt synthesis zone and an oxime syn thesis zone, and in which the circulating liquid is continu ously supplied with nitrogen monoxide which serves as nitrogen source for the formation of the hydroxylammonium salt, and which is converted into hydroxylamine by cataly tic reduction with hydrogen. The circulating liquid is, before it enters the hydroxyl ammonium salt synthesis zone, subjected to a stripping process by bringing the circulating liquid via a heat ex changing surface in heat exchange with nitrogen monoxide containing water vapour, upon which the water vapour condenses, and the remaining gas containing nitrogen monoxide as nitrogen source is used in the reduction of nitrogen monoxide to hydroxylamine.
