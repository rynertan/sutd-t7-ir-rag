# Portable breathing monitor for telemetric measurement by a central processing station.

## Abstract
A monitor for breathing ventilation and oxygen con sumption, mounted on a mask M , worn by the person being examined, comprises a control modulus 9 17 that realizes sampling of the breathing volume and of the oxygen content, and a radio transmitter 25 that sends the signals to a central processing unit UF . By means of the controlled sampling a micro mixing chamber 3 of fixed capacity and containing a polarographic electrode 2 is made equivalent to a dynamic chamber of variable capacity. At the end of each breathing cycle, when the air flow is zero a pressure transducer 9 , detects the cease of air flow and emits a signal to suppress output pulses due to the intertia of a turbine flowmeter 7 .
