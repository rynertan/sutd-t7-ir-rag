# Process for the production of methylenedicarbanilates and the compounds thus obtained.

## Abstract
A process is described for producing methylenedicar banilates by reacting carbanilates with formaldehyde in the presence of a specific catalyst. The catalyst is selected from 1 a cation exchanger containing sulfonic acid groups which has a proton exchange capacity of at least 0.1 meq g, 2 a clay having an acidity of at least 0.1 neq g at an acidic site, the acid strength of the acidic site being 3.0 or less as a value of acidity function Hâ‚€, 3 a mixed oxide having an acidity of at least 0.1 neq g at an acidic site, the acid strength of the acidic site being 3.0 or less as a value of acidity function H, 4 heteropolymolybdic acid, and 5 heteropolytungstic acid.
