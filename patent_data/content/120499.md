## Description
The present invention relates to a method for the removal of iron pyrites from coal and carbon structures during ash removal by chemical means. Iron pyrites PE S2 is an undesirable impurity in coal. The most commonly empityed methods for pyrite removal from coal rely on differences in physical properties between pyrites and coal particles. Flotation relies on surface properties, gravity separation relies on density, and magnetic separation relies on magactic properties. Therefore, in order to remove most pyrites from Coal, it is necessary to liberate the pyrites particles from the organic coal matrix, that is, to separate the pyrites particles from the 1 particles Pyrites is commonly distributed within the coal matrix as pyrites particles laminated to the organic coal matrix, often with intermediate bonding by inorganic mineral natter such as aluminosilicates. Conventional removal methods achieve pyrites liberation by grinding the coal, the finex the grind the more complete is the liberation. However, fine grinding is expensive and often introduces downstreain processing or utilisation disadvantages. Cur invention has as its objective a method which liberates pyrites from coal without the necessity for fine grinding. In its broadest form the invention provides a method for liberating pyrites from coal comprising crushing coal to a suitable particle size leaching the crushed coal with hydrofluoric acid, and treating the leached solids using otherwise conventional pyrites remnva7 methods. The suitable particle size range varies from coal to coal, however it is coarser in size than. that necessary for satisfactory conventional liberation of pyrites. The hydrofluoric acid dissolves most of the inorganic minerals within the coal matrix, including the predominant alutninosilicates, but not the pyrites thereby breaking the bond between the pyrites and the organic coal matrix, and liberating the pyrites particles. ConentionaI pyrites removal methods such as gravity separation, magnetic separation, and flotation can then be employed.Gravity separation is particularly enhanced as the organic coal matrix achieves a lower than normal density after hydrofluoric acid leaching, due to the dissolution of ash fonaing ms nerals, thereby increasing the density difference between the pyrites refuse and the coal cepts. Tbe hydrofluoric acid leaching conditions are not critical with respect to acid concentration, temperature or leaching time. We h2We su cess Tglly employed acid concentrations of about 3 to 70 wfw8, temperatures of 20to 100 C and leaching times from about 10 minutes to 48 hours. The raw coal must be crushed to a particles size suitable for hydrofluoric acid leaching. It is necessary to reduce the particle size only to that extent required to provide access for the hydrofluoric acid leach liquor to the mineral matter associated with the coal matrix.It is not necessary to completely liberate the mineral particles, which would require finer grinding. A cordingly1 relatively coarse coal particles can be acid leached and then treated for pyrites removal, liberation of pyrites by grinding alone would only be achieved at much finer particle size.. We have achieved excellent pyrites removal from coal by hydrofluoric acid leaching raw coal at particle sizes as coarse as Smm, and then using conventional scparation methods. EXAMPLE A Using a coal with .98 sulphur, approximately .4 of which is pyritic. the following results were obtained crushing the coal to 2mm minus and drying, the coal was then subjected to a heavy media wash and it was found sulphur was reduced by approximately .02 . A sample of the same coal crushed to 2mm minus and subjected to the hyrdofluoric wash detailed earlier was then treated to a heavy media wash in the same conditions as the untreated sample resdual sulphur was then found to be 0.4 . More than 99t of the pyritic sulphur was removed
