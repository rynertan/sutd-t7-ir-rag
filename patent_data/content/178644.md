## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF WEAVING WARPS OF MONOFILA MENT THERMOPLASTIC SYNTHETIC YARN.In the following disclosure, the term weaving warp is used synonymous with warp section i.e. a warp containing a fractional number of yarns relative to the total number of yarns which will be placed on the weaving loom, it being possible to obtain a weaving warp suitable for direct use on the loom by unwinding a plurality of warp sections and rewinding them onto a single beam by a process known as assembly winding. Although the disclosure refers specifically to warps for weaving end use, there is not restriction intended on the use of such warps to any particular textile application.In traditional systems for the preparation of weaving warps of monofilament thermoplastic synthetic yarn, the spinning device contains one or more single nozzle spinneret s . After cooling and oiling, the monofilaments corresponding to the nozzles are wound up individually on the take up device, each monofilament being wound up on its own spool or package.The spinning head can house only a limited number of spinnerets and the subsequent filament cooling device and take up device s can serve only one single spinning head with the said limited number of yarns.In other cases, spinnerets provided with a plurality of nozzles are used, and all the yarns emerging from such a spinneret are cooled, oiled and parallel wound on a single spool. This spool, containing a plurality of individual tans, is then unwound by the rolling take off method and the individual yarns are rewound, each yarn being wound onto its own single spool. The weaving warp is then obtained by the warping of a large number of yarns coming from as many spools or packages placed on a creel.If the yarn obtained in the melt spinning stage is not sufficiently drawn, it is necessary to submit it to a drawing process, carried out on suitable machines, before warping. Normally such drawing machines act individually on each undrawn spool to produce a corresponding drawn spool single end processing .The object of the present invention is to provide a system for the production of weaving warps wherein the spinning device is able to produce simultaneously the exact number of yarns required to form the weaving warp.The method of the present invention is proper for the production of weaving warps from monofilament thermoplastic yarns of the following types polyester, polyamides, polypropylene.The device for accomplishing the process according to the invention shown schematically in the figures, comprises Extruder and melt spinning head 1 , comprising one or more pump s 2 for metering the molten polymer, spin pack and spinneret retain ing block 3 and a spinneret with as many nozzles as the number of yarns required Extruded filament cooling device, constituted by an air blowing chamber 4 Spinning duct 5 Spin finish application or oiling device 6 and yarn guides 7 Yarn suction device 8 , activated in the event of yarn breakage, and a yarn separating guide 9 Yarn transport rolls godets 10 , 11 , which may also be used to stretch or draw the yarn sheet, and optional drawing devices and apparatus Yarn sheet nipping 13 , cutting 14 and taping 15 devices, used in order to replace the fully wound warping beam during con tinous spinning operation Yarn separating guide reed 16 Warping beam winding assembly 17 .According to a preferred practical embodiment of the present invention, the quipment also incorporates Yarn accumulation and recovery device 12 , allowing the yarn sheet to be stored during a beam change without interrupting the spinning process, it being only necessary to reduce the speed of spinning during such a beam change.The more typical parts and functions of the equipment are now considered in greater detail.The melt spinning head may have a single spinneret having a number of nozzles equal to the number of yarns constituting the weaving warp, or it may be provided with a plurality of spinnerets, with the total nozzle number equal to the number of yarns constituting the said warp.By using a plurality of spinnerets, a greater temperature uniformity can be obtained, as the surface in contact vith the heat transfer medium within the spinning head is increased.The number of yarns required for a weaving warp is normally at least 500.By means of the weaving warp production system according t√≥ the pre sent invention, the equipment is substantially reduced compared to the traditional systems, in that it is not necessary to pass through the single spool package stage, the yarns obtained from spinning being used directly to form the weaving warp.The warp manufacturing process is therefor absolutely continuous. It is not divided into two separate stages, as in the traditional systems, where there is a separate spinning stage with the yarn being taken up on spools, followed by a second warping stage, starting from such spools previously loaded onto a feed creel. By means of the process according to the present invention, the production of weaving warps with a single spinning head and a single collection device is therefore made possible, in contrast to the traditional systems, where it is necessary to have a large number of spinning heads for each weaving warp, and the warping operation is moreover carried out in a subsequent stage completely separated from the melt spinning stage.According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention,an essential element in the process, and in the related equipment, is constituted by the device for the accumulation and recovery of the yarn sheet arising from the continuous spinning stage it allows the replacement of the warping beam without the need to stop the spinning process, it being only necessary to reduce the spinning speed.The above device may be constituted in particular by two sets of rolls both positioned horizontally and with their axes perpendicular to the direction of travel of the yarn sheet, the rolls of the first set 19 , located at the lower level, being in a fixed position, whilst those of the second set 20 are in a staggered position relative to the rolls of the first set, and can moreover be shifeed vertically downwards. Under normal operating conditions, the yarn sheet runs between the two sets of rolls, wihtout coming into contact with the said rolls.In the accumulation stage, however, the upper set of rolls is lowered beneath the stationary set, until the position 2 is reached, thus compelling the yarn sheet to run along a looped path.The amount of yarn which can be accumulated in such a way will be proportional to the number of rolls and to the maximum possible distance between the stationary rolls and the movable rolls.The accumulation device starts operating simultaneously with the yarn sheet flipping, culting and taping device during a beam change.It is obvious that, in the process according to the present invention, every known device for the accumulation and changing of the warp beam may be used. The spinning process may be advantageously integrated with a yarn sheet drawing device using two sets of rolls, preferably constituted by a main roll of greater diameter and two pressure rolls per each set, the peripheral velocity of the second set being greater than that of the first system, so that the ratio of the two relative peripheral velocities is equal to the desired yarn draw ratio.Immediately after the drawing and before the accumulator, according to the final desired characteristics of the warps, it could be convenient to include a conventional device for thermal relaxation and heat setting of the warp.By means of the industrial process which is object of the present invention, it is thus possible to obtain weaving warps composed of yarns having different characteristics, essentially depending on whether the drawing device just described is used or not, and or on the final wind up speed.It is obvious that, by using the drawing device, completely drawn yarns can be produced. In the absence of the drawing device, the final wind up speed determines the molecular orientation and characteristics of the so produced yarn, with increasing wind up speed resulting in increased molecular orientation.According to the characteristics of the thermoplastic resin used, a high wind up speed allows nearly completely drawn yarns to be obtained, such yarns being suitable for direct use in weaning.At an intermediate wind up speed, incompletely drawn yarns are obtained, and the warps so obtained can be advantageously drawn by using the wet warp drawing process, as disclosed in the earlierItalian Patent Applications NO 19907 82, 23476 83 and 24050 83, of the present Applicant.A typical characteristic of the novel process for the preparation of warps is that it permits extremely high yarn wind up speeds, speeds in excess of 6000 m min, without any mechanical problems being evident, as the collecting beam is anchored on both sides in the winding machine.This results in less wear and greater reliability than is found in traditional spool winding systems.For the nipping, cutting and taping of the warp sheet at a beam change, various known systems may be used, essentially constituted by rubber clamping jaws, by devices for feeding and applying an upper and a lower layer of adhesive tape, and by a yarn sheet cutting device.Example 1Starting from a semi dull polyester resin obtained by poly condensation of teraphthalic acid and ethylene glycol, having the following main characteristics intrinsic viscosity 0.648 melting point Mettler 260.90C acidic COOH end groups 36.0 eq. 106 DEG tdiethyleneglYcol groups 1.88 mol.
