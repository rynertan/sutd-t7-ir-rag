# Process for preparing a thin film and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A casting solution 3 comprising a film forming material and a solvent is fed to the surface of a liquid substrate 4 immiscible with the solution 3 by utilizing interfacial tension. Spontaneous spreading of the casting solution 3 occurs across the surface of the liquid substrate 4 and evaporation of the solvent produces the thin film 5 on the liquid surface which is continuously collected. The casting solution 3 may be held as a separate layer below the substrate 4 in a container 1 and be fed to the surface or the substrate 4 through a channel 2 by capillary action. Alternatively the casting solution and substrate may be in separate containers with a feed channel or port between the containers. The feed, instead of, or in addition to, relying on a capillary, may comprise a material which shows selective wettability for the casting solution in preference to the liquid substrate. The process and apparatus allows thin films of reason able width to be obtained.
