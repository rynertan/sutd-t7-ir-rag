# Water in wax emulsion blasting agent.

## Abstract
A water in wax emulsion explosive composition is provided wherein the continuous carbonaceous fuel phase comprises paraffin wax together with a minor amount of a rheology modifier and stabilizer combination comprising an ethylene containing polymer and a low molecular weight hydrocarbon liquid. The resulting explosive composition exhibits properties of viscosity and stability comparable to similar compositions containing highly refined microcrystal line wax fuels.
