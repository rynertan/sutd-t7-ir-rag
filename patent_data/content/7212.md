# Protective control system for vehicle starter and electrical systems.

## Abstract
A protective control system for the starter system of an engine cranked by a starter motor 32 includes a frequency selective logic 38 responsive to engine RPM to automatically open the starter relay 26 above a predetermined frequency, to prevent cranking of the engine above the corresponding engine RPM, and the frequency selective logic 38 includes a hysteresis network to prevent re closing of the starter relay, and re cranking of the engine, until engine RPM drops to a lower level.
