# Photovoltaic cells and a method of making such cells.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a photovoltaic cell comprising a a cadmium telluride film 3 , b a barrier layer 5 facing and in intimate contact with one side of said film with a rectifying junction at the interface therebetween and c a conductive layer 6 facing and in intimate contact with the other side of said film with an ohmic junction at the interface therebetween, wherein the film is relatively cadmium rich at the ohmic junction interface. The present invention also provides a method of making a photovoltaic cell, wherein cadmium telluride is electrodeposited on a smooth cadmium surface, a photovoltaic cadmium telluride film thereby being formed and ohmic contact being made between the cadmium telluride film and the cadmium surface substrate.
