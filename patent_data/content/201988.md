## Description
The present invention relates to dihydropyridazinone derivatives and in particular to such compounds having a substituted phenyl group at the 6 position of the dihydropyridazinone ring. This invention further relates to processes for their preparation, intermediates in their preparation, their use as therapeutic agents and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The compounds of this invention are phosphodiesterase type III inhibitors and are of use in combatting such conditions wherein such inhibition is thought to be beneficial. Thus the compounds of this invention are positive inotropic agents and vasodilators and are therefore of value in combatting cardiovascular disease, in particular congestive heart failure. In addition the compounds of this invention inhibit platelet aggregation and therefore have an antithrombotic effect. Furthermore the compounds of this invention are bronchodilators and are therefore of use in combatting chronic obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and bronchitis. The major utility of the compounds of this invention is in the treatment of congestive heart failure, for such treatment the compounds have a very desirable profile of activity. Congestive heart failure is traditionally treated with cardiac glycosides, for example digoxin and digitoxin, and sympathomimetic agents. The glycosides have pronounced toxic effects with a low therapeutic index. The sympathomimetic agents generally do not have the desired profile of activity and are not orally effective. Amrinone is a marketed compound of interest that is reported to be an inotropic agent. This has an undesirable profile of side effects when administered orally and development is being restricted to other modes of administration. Clearly there is a continuing need for orally active inotropic agents that have a good therapeutic profile. Accordingly the present invention provides compounds of the formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein Suitably R¹ is hydrogen. Preferably R¹ is methyl. Suitably R² is phenyl C Suitably R³ is hydrogen or C In one aspect it is preferred that one of R² and R³ is hydrogen or C Suitably Y is a sulphur atom. Preferably Y is a group NR⁴ wherein R⁴ is hydrogen, phenyl C Particular compounds of this invention are The compounds of the invention are depicted as dihydropyridazin 3 2H ones, but of course the present invention covers all tautomeric forms thereof, for example the dihydropyridazinol form and all the tautomeric forms of the aminoheterocycle and when Y is NH Furthermore the present invention covers all the optical isomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I in the racemic and separated forms. In particular when R¹ is methyl the R isomers of the compounds of the formula I vide infra are preferred. Compounds of the formula I may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with metal ions, such as alkali metals for example sodium and potassium, or alkaline earth metals for example calcium and magnesium. The compounds of the formula I can also form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, suitable salts include those formed with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, maleic, lactic, ascorbic, fumaric, oxalic, methanesulphonic and ethanesulphonic acids. In order to use a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the treatment of humans and other mammals it is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be administered in standard manner for the treatment of the indicated diseases, for example orally, parenterally, trans dermally, rectally, via inhalation or via buccal administration. Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are active when given orally or via buccal administration can be formulated as syrups, tablets, capsules and lozenges. A syrup formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound or salt in a liquid carrier for example, ethanol, glycerine or water with a flavouring or colouring agent. Where the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier routinely used for preparing solid formulations may be used. Examples of such carriers include magnesium stearate, starch, lactose and sucrose. Where the composition is in the form of a capsule, any routine encapsulation is suitable, for example using the aforementioned carriers in a hard gelatin capsule shell. Where the composition is in the form of a soft gelatin shell capsule any pharmaceutical carrier routinely used for preparing dispersions or suspensions may be considered, for example aqueous gums, celluloses, silicates or oils and are incorporated in a soft gelatin capsule shell. Typical parenteral compositions consist of a solution or suspension of the compound or salt in a sterile aqueous or non aqueous carrier optionally containing a parenterally acceptable oil, for example polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, lecithin, arachis oil, or sesame oil. A typical suppository formulation comprises a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which is active when administered in this way, with a binding and or lubricating agent, for example polymeric glycols, gelatins, cocoa butter or other low melting vegetable waxes or fats.
