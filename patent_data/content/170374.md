# Cast to size epoxy resin tools for stamping sheet metal panels.

## Abstract
Very large tools can be cast to size by making a pattern 8, 10, 12 of the article to be formed by the tool, laying the pattern 8, 10, 12 up in a pattern box 14 , applying a release coat 18 and coating the pattern 8, 10, 12 and box 14 with a tough, curable tool surface layer 26 . A small amount of epoxy resin 32 filled with a thermally conductive particulate filler is cast into the pattern box 14 before the surface layer 26 fully cures. Relatively large chunks 28 of thermally conductive material are added to the box 14 which are covered with additional cast epoxy resin 32 . The cure of the epoxy resin 32 is controlled to effect complete cure at room temperature within a few days but never to exceed a peak cure temperature above about 70 C.
