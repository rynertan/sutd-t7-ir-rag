# Gravitational flow system for the sequential administration of a plurality of medical liquids.

## Abstract
Gravitational flow system and equipment sets for the sequential administration of medical liquids wherein a primary liquid from a first source 11 can be administered at a flow rate independent of the flow rate of secondary liquid in a second source 13 . A combined air barrier and liquid sequencing valve chamber 32 controls the sequencing of the various flows and prevents inadvertent administration of air when the second source is depleted by means of a hydrophilic barrier 45 . The valve chamber 32 is divided into two separate flow chambers 34, 41 which are in liquid communication with the respective sources 11, 13 and in air communication therebetween by means of hydrophobic membrane 53 .
