# Pulse width decoder for double frequency encoded serial data.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a pulse width decoder which receives a double frequency modulated DFM waveform and recovers therefrom the contained NRZ L data and clock information. Basically, the decoder looks for long and short pulses in the DFM waveform. A long pulse is decoded as a 0 , while a pair of short, opposite polarity pulses are decoded as a 1 . In addition, in order to allow for pulse shortening in the DFM waveform, a short pulse followed by a long pulse is inter preted as a 1 . The clock signal is primarily derived from two delayed versions of the DFM waveform to create one clock edge every bit time.
