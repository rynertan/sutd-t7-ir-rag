# Hollow filament separatory modules and methods of making such modules.

## Abstract
A hollow filament separatory module comprises a heli cally wound annular bundle of semi permeable tubular fila ments 22 contained in a pressure resistant enclosure 32, 34 36, 38 . Fluid concentrate to be separated is supplied under pressure through a port 44 to the outsides of the filaments 22 and the separated permeate flows through open ends of the filaments into a collection chamber 71 and thence flows out of a port 50 . To separate the pressurised fluid concen trate from the collection chamber 71 the ends of the fila ments are embedded in potting compound 66 and sealing rings 58, 60 form seals between the enclosure port 34 and the potting compound 66 . The inlet pressure of the fluid is balanced by a pressure between an end plate 38 of the enclosure and a flat face of the potting compound 66 . It is essential however for the filaments 22 to have open ends opening into the chamber 71 and to provide this while main taining a sufficient area of the potting compound 66 in con tact with the plate 30 and so, the potting compound has a series of V shaped slices cut from it to provide the surfaces 78,79 . The sum of the areas 78, 79 projected on the plate 38 is less than 50 of the area of the remaining flat face of the potting compound in contact with the plate 38 .
