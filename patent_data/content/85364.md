# Crop harvesting machine having a windrow grouper.

## Abstract
In order to form a double windrow of a grass crop after it has been cut, a windrow grouper 12 is mounted behind a mower conditioner unit 10 . The windrow grouper is in the form of an upright rotating drum 40 and skirt 66 which is provided with crop engaging tines 68 , and is positioned so as to deflect the cut crop into the double windrow when the crop is still in flight from the mowing unit 10 and before it has any substantial contact with the ground. The windrow grouper 12 can be swung clear of the crop delivered by the mowing unit 10 to enable an initial windrow to be laid, and then swung back into the flight path of the crop to form the double windrow.
