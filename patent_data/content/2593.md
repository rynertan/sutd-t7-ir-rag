# Apparatus for sampling a flow of liquid from a fluid, at least some of which is a liquid.

## Abstract
A flow sampling apparatus for sampling a flow of liquid from a fluid for example milk and air has a body through which a central inlet conduit 4 runs and a dome 2 on the body. An inlet orifice 5 on the inlet conduit 4 discharges a fluid containing some liquid milk and the liquid flows evenly over the inner surface 3 of the dome 2 . One or more outlet ports is connected to a pair of intermediate vanes 11 of a flow divider having at least four such vanes and the liquid passing between the intermediate vanes 11 is a representative sample of the whole flow over the inner surface 3 of the dome 2 . The sample is delivered to a sampling flask 19 .
