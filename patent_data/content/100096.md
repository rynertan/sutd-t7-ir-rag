# Brake pressure control unit of deceleration responsive type.

## Abstract
A brake pressure control unit of the deceleration respon sive type comprises a control valve 12 12 100 operable to restrict the transfer of fluid pressure therethrough from an inlet port 64 64 to an outlet port 92 92 and biased by a spring 48 48 116 to a position of opening, a storing chamber 44 44 130 operatively connected to the control valve in a man ner to assist the bias of the control valve spring with an increas ing force as the fluid pressure in the storing chamber in creases, a deceleration responsive valve 14 14 operable to sealingly close the storing chamber in response to a vehicle deceleration at a rate exceeding a predetermined value, and a differential pressure valve 16 16 disposed between the de celeration responsive valve and the storing chamber to restrict the transfer of fluid pressure therethrough. The differential pressure valve is adapted to open in response to a varying fluid fluid pressure that varies with the variation of the rate of fluid pressure at the inlet port.
