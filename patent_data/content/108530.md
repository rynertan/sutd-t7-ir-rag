# COMPOUND VARIABLE MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE SHIFTING MECHANISM

## Abstract
A variable mechanical advantage variable effective length shifting mechanism 30 is provided, preferably for shifting a synchronized positive clutch transmission. A compound mechanism comprises a first member 34 in the form of a variable mechanical advantage variable effective length first class lever having a first lever portion 34 , a second lever portion 42 and a fixed pivot axis 38 , and a second member 44 in the form of a second class lever pivotably mounted about a pivot axis 70 extending sub stantially parallel to and spaced from the first pivot axis. A pivot pin 48 extending substantially parallel to the first and second pivot axes is slidably received in axially extending slots 46 and 84 provided in the first and second members, respectively. A resilient biasing member 58 is provided for resiliently biasing the pivot pin axially away from the first pivot axis and axially toward the second pivot axis. The pivot pin may overcome the bias of the biasing member to move toward the first pivot axis and away from the second pivot axis to increase the mechanical advantage of the compound mechanism by increasing the mechanical advantage of both the first class lever member and the second class lever member. The second class second member carries a shift finger 32 for pivotal movement therewith about the second pivot axis.
