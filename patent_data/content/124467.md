# Drill rig hook.

## Abstract
A hook for suspending a pipe string or other load in a well rig, including a tubular outer body 19 supported by a first connector structure 23 which is attachable to a sus pending line, a tubular inner body 25 which supports a second connector structure preferably taking the form of a hook, with the inner body 25 being received within the outer body 19 and being yieldingly urged upwardly relative there to by a resilient unit 26 or assembly located within the inner body, and with a structure within the inner body 25 bearing upwardly against and supporting the resilient assembly and attached to the first connector structure 23 . A cam mechan ism between the inner 25 and outer bodies 19 automati cally cams the inner body 25 to a predetermined rotary position upon upward movement, with a locking device 57 or devices serving to retain the inner body 25 in fixed rotary position and or to lock the camming mechanism in a fixed position in a manner determining the rotary setting to which the inner body 25 returns upon upward movement. The mentioned first 23 and or second connectors may each consist of two parts receivable within one of the tubular bodies 19 25 and held in operative connecting engagement therewith by a spacer 35 between the two parts. A link sup porting member may be formed separately from the load supporting hook, to be detachable therefrom for repair or in replacement.
