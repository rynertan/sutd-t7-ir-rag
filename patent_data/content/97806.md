# Universal image coder and controller for multicolor electrolytic printing.

## Abstract
Apparatus for locally coding image information and then controlling the delivery of voltage pulses based thereon to the print electrodes of a matrix printer for multicolored image reproduction is described. Control of the print elec trode pulses is based on both pulse amplitude and pulse width variations. This concurrent control capability facilitates multicolor printing using a dye matrix that has interleaved dyes which are alternately amplitude and duration sensitive. The control apparatus reads the image data, which define a set of pulse profiles for the particular dye matrix used, into the memory 26 . Thereafter, this information is incrementally retrieved by scanning register means 28 and delivered simultaneously to all of the printer s electrodes 10 . After all memory information is printed, it is reloaded and the new image information is printed. It is possible to vary the bit patterns of the memory retrieval means to effect dynamic changes in the printed result, particularly to achieve gray scale control.
