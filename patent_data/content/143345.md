## Description
The present invention relates to the use of hyperimmune milk collected from a bovid being maintained in a hyperimmune state for the manufacture of a hyperimmune milk composition for treatment of cardiovascular diseases or for lowering lipid blood stream levels in animals and human beings, said milk used in an amount and for a time sufficient to produce anti arteriosclerotic or antiaging vascular effects. The normal vascular system of mammals, especially humans, includes all of the organs, such as the heart and the arteries, involved in blood transport and circulation. Two major disorders affect the vascular system in animals arteriosclerosis and aging. Arteriosclerosis, a generic term for the thickening and hardening of the arterial wall, is responsible for the majority of deaths in the United States and most Westernized societies. There are various types of arteriosclerosis such as atherosclerosis, focal calcification, and arteriolosclerosis. The changes associated with arteriosclerosis of the various types and aging are partly overlapping. See for example Harrison s Principles of Internal Medicine, 9th Edition, pp. 156 1166. The normal artery wall consists of three reasonably well defined layers the intima, the media and the adventitia. The intima is a layer of endothelial cells lining the lumen of all arteries. The endothelial cells are attached to each other by a series of junctional complexes and also are attached to an underlying meshwork of loose connective tissue, the basal lamina. The lining endothelial cells form a barrier that controls the entry of substances from the blood into the arterial wall. The media consists of smooth muscle cells arranged in either single layers or multiple layers. The outermost layer of the artery is the adventitia which is delimited by the external elastic lamina. This external coat consists of a loose interwoven mixture of thick bundles of collagen, elastic fibers of varying size and a mixture of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Maintenance of the endothelial cell lining is critical. Endothelial cell turnover occurs at a slow rate but may accelerate in focal areas by changing patterns of flow along the vessel wall. Intact endothelial cells function to prevent clotting partly by elaboration of prostacyclin that inhibits platelet function, thereby enhancing unimpeded flow of blood. When the lining is damaged, however, platelets adhere to it in part as the result of production of a different class of prostaglandins, the thromboxanes, and form a clot. The ability of the arterial wall to maintain the integrity of its endothelium, prevent platelet aggregation and insure the nutrition of its middle portion may be the critical determinants of the arteriosclerotic process. The major change that occurs with normal aging in the arterial wall is a slow symmetrical increase in the thickness of the intima. This results from an accumulation of small muscle cells. In the nondiseased artery wall the lipid content, mainly cholesterol ester and phospholipid, also progressively increases with age. While most of the phospholipid in the normal artery wall appears to be derived from in situ synthesis, the cholesterol ester that accumulates with aging appears to be derived from plasma, since it contains principally linoleic acid, the major plasma cholesterol ester of fatty acid. As the normal artery ages, smooth muscle cells and connective tissue accumulate in the intima, leading to progressive thickening of the layer coupled with progressive accumulation of fatty acid, resulting in a gradual increase in the rigidity of the vessels. The larger arteries may become dilated, elongated and porous and aneurysms may form in areas of encroaching degenerating arteriosclerotic plaque. By far, the leading cause of death in the United States both above and below age 65 is atherosclerosis, the atheromatous form of arteriosclerosis. The lesions are commonly classifed as fatty streaks, fibrous plaques and complicated lesions. The fatty streaks are characterized by an accumulation of lipid filled smooth muscle cells and fibrous tissue in focal areas of the intima, and are stained distinctively by fat soluble dyes. The lipid is mainly cholesterol oleate. Fibrous plaques are elevated areas of intima thickening and will present the most characteristic lesion of advancing arteriosclerosis. They appear in the abdominal aorta, coronary arteries and carotid arteries in the third decade and increase progressively with age. Complicated lesions are calcified fibrous plaques containing various degrees of necrosis, thrombosis and ulceration. A number of factors called risk factors have been identified in individuals who develop atherosclerosis. The risk factor concept implies that a person with at least one risk factor is more likely to develop a clinical atherosclerotic event and to do so earlier than a person with no risk factors. The presence of multiple risk factors further accelerates atherosclerosis. Among the reversible or partially reversible risk factors are hyperlipidemia hypercholesterolemia and or hypertriglyceridemia , hyperglycemia and diabetes, low levels of high density lipoproteins, hypertension, obesity, and cigarette smoking. As stated in Harrison s, Among the risk factors referred to above that might be particularly well suited to therapeutic treatment is hyperlipidemia. Although control of factors such as obesity and cigarette consumption depend, to a great degree, on the will and inclination of the individual, if a reasonable method for lowering, e.g., serum cholesterol, low density lipids LDL and triglyceride blood stream levels were provided, it would be suitable for treatment of a broad spectrum of individuals. Because of the widespread distribution of vascular disorders such as arteriosclerosis disorders and the naturally occurring aging of the vascular system and its accompanying problems, a need exists for an effective method for both preventing and possibly treating these disorders. If a natural food product, such as milk for example, could be obtained having anti arteriosclerotic and aging effects it would be an easily administerable, readily available, safe therapeutic composition. As with arteriosclerotic and vascular diseases in general, if a natural food product, such as milk for example could be obtained, it would be an easily administerable, readily available, safe therapeutic composition. It has been known in the prior art to produce milks having a variety of therapeutic effects. Beck, for example, has disclosed a milk containing antibody to Streptococcus mutans which has dental caries inhibiting effects None of the aforementioned references, however, disclose or suggest milk having antiarteriosclerotic or vascular anti aging properties. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide milk having beneficial properties towards disorders of the vascular system. Another object of the invention is to provide a process for producing such milk. These and other objects of the invention which will hereinafter become more readily apparent have been attained by providing a special milk for treating vascular disorders in mammals which comprises Object of the invention is the use of hyperimmune milk collected from a bovid being maintained in a hyperimmune state for the manufacture of a hyperimmune milk composition for treatment of cardiovascular diseases or for lowering lipid blood stream levels in animals and human beings, said milk used in an amount and for a time sufficient to produce antiarteriosclerotic or antiaging vascular effects. According to a preferred embodiment said milk is in powdery form. According to a further preferred embodiment said milk is in fluid form. According to a further preferred embodiment said milk is in concentrated form. According to a further preferred embodiment said milk is a food product containing same. According to a further preferred embodiment said food product is yogurt. According to a further preferred embodiment said bovid is a cow. According to a further preferred embodiment said bovid is maintained in said hyperimmune state by administering to said bovid booster injections of an antigen or mixture of antigens. According to a further preferred embodiment said antigen or mixture of antigens booster is injected in a dose of 10⁶ cells to 10²⁰ cells. According to a further preferred embodiment said milk is prepared by a process which comprises According to a further preferred embodiment said process further comprises According to a further preferred embodiment said lipids are selected from the group consisting of triglycerides, cholesterol, low density lipids and mixtures thereof. A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein The invention comprises a natural food product milk which has beneficial properties towards vascular systems of mammals, as well as a method for producing the same. The milk of the present invention, being a natural product, can be used to treat vascular disorders associated with any disease or injury, or a natural condition such as vascular aging in animals and humans without fear of side effects. Examples of vascular disorders which may be treated with the milk of the present invention include aging disorders such as a decrease in the rigidity of vessels, and a decrease in the incidence wherein the large arteries become dilated and elongated, as well as a decrease in aneurisms which form in areas of encroaching arteriosclerotic plaques. Other aging induced vascular damage which can be prevented or reversed with the milk of the present invention is the increase in the thickness of the arterial intima, the reversal of gradual accumulation of smooth muscle cells, as well as a decrease in the accumulation of lipid content in the arterial wall. Among the abnormal i.e. non aging induced disorders of the vascular system which are treatable preventable or reversable with the milk of the present invention is arteriosclerosis, which includes both atheromatous forms and non atheromatous forms. Among the non atheromatous forms of arteriosclerosis treatable with the milk of the present invention is focal calcification also called Monckeberg s sclerosis , which is common in the lower extremities, upper extremities, and the arterial supply of the genital tract in both sexes. Another disorder is focal calcification, which involves degeneration of smooth muscle cells followed by calcium deposition. Another non atheromatous form of arteriosclerosis is arteriolosclerosis which involves hyaline and general changes affecting both the intima and media of small arteries and arterioles, particularly in the spleen, pancreas, adrenal and kidney. Importantly, the milk of the present invention can be utilized for the treatment of atherosclerosis. This involves both the prevention and regression of the formation of fatty streaks, fibrous plaques and complicated lesions, as described previously. Athough it is probable that irreversible risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as male sex or genetic traits e.g. positive family history of premature atherosclerosis might not be reversed with the milk of the invention, the so called reversible factors, however, may. Thus, the milk of the invention is useful in reducing the accumulation of lipids and preventing or reversing hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia. Various forms of atherosclerosis can be treated. In the process of this invention, the source bovid includes any milk producing member of the genus The invention is based on the discovery that when such bovid is brought to a specific state of immunization by means of periodic booster administrations of an antigen or a mixture of antigens, the bovid will produce milk which has highly beneficial properties in the treatment of vascular disorders. The beneficial milk properties are not produced by all bovids that are immunized. The induction of immune sensitivity alone is insufficient to cause the appearance of the properties in milk, as is shown by the fact that normal cow s milk does not contain these properties, even though cows have become sensitized against various antigens during normal immunization against cow diseases. Furthermore, the properties are not always present in milk produced by bovids maintained in the immune state by booster injections. It is only in a specific hyperimmune state that the milk has the desired effects. This special state is only achieved by administering periodic boosters with sufficiently high doses of antigens or mixtures of antigens. The preferred dose range should be equal to or greater than 50 of the dosage necessary to cause primary sensitization of the bovid. Thus, there is a booster dosage threshold below which the properties are not produced in the milk even though the cow may be in what is normally called an immune state. In order to achieve the hyperimmune state it is essential to test the bovid s milk after a first series of booster administrations. If the milk does not contain the desired properties, a second series of boosters of higher dosage has to be administered. This process is repeated until the properties appear in the milk. In summary the process comprises the following steps It might also be possible, for example, to use a combination of different immunization procedures, i.e., intramuscular injection for primary immunization and intravenous injection for booster injections. Many different combinations of immunization methods might be employed by those skilled in the art to 1 sensitize and 2 induce the hyperimmune state. Fluid milk can also be used, as well as concentrated milk products or a fraction of the milk containing the biologically active factor or factors such as the acid whey fraction. The invention is based in part on the discovery that the milk from a hyperimmune bovid has beneficial properties on the cardiovascular system. For example, it has been discovered that in hearts of female rabbits which have been fed a steady diet of hyperimmune milk, the endothelial cells of the heart were protected against extensive endothelial damage of varying extent and severity observed in rabbits fed normal milk. In the latter rabbits, craters or holes were present where one or more cells had degenerated and detached, whereas in hyperimmune milk fed rabbits these were not present. Transmission electron microscopy of both populations of rabbits showed major differences in the blood vessels. Significant pathological features of blood vessels in control hearts included large lipid droplets, endothelial degeneration multiple small lipid vacuoles, single or multiple large lipid droplets filling the cytoplasm of endothelial cells, foam cells latent with lipid, and a strong tendency of fibrin platelets to adhere to the luminal surface of endothelial cells. All of the aforementioned derangements accompany the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. These derangements were not found in blood vessels from representative areas of rabbit populations which were on a steady diet of hyperimmune milk. Histological sections of hearts from the rabbits fed the hyperimmune milk and of rabbits fed control milk showed that lipid was present in the lumina of some blood vessels of control hearts and cardiac muscle fibers of control hearts were filled with lipid. Coronary blood vessels from rabbits on hyperimmune milk lacked the atherosclerotic lipid deposits which are observed in control vessels. These results show conclusively that hyperimmune milk slows and or represses the pathogeneses of arteriosclerosis and aging of the heart. The same tests of rabbit populations, as well as clinical trials with human subjects, has conclusively demonstrated that diets incorporating the hyperimmune milk of this invention results in a reduction of serum cholesterol levels, as well as marked reductions in triglyceride levels and low density lipid levels, all of which are key risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. In addition to cardiovascular tissue, 16 other tissues representing one or more components of each major organ system have also been studied from the same animals. Hyperimmune milk has no adverse effects on any of these tissues. The milk of the invention can be provided in any amount which effects or maintains the reversal of vascular disorders in warm blooded animals. Daily amounts of 1 ml to 10 liters based on fluid milk can be provided, depending on the particular circumstance of the disorder and the mammal species. The same amounts can be utilized in normal subjects when operating in a preventive mode. In a preferred mode the milk is administered periodically e.g. daily in dosages of approximately 40 g for a prolonged period of time such as at least 15 30 days and more, up to several years. As will be recognized, the treatment duration can be shortened by increasing daily dosages. Additionally, smaller dosages spread out throughout the day may be more effective than a single dosage taken once a day. The fat free milk can be incorporated into any food product, as long as the food product is not treated at a temperature which is too elevated and would inactivate the vascular treatment properties of the product. A temperature lower than 150 C is preferred. For example puddings or yogurt may be prepared with hyperimmune milk. Further, it has been found that the whey fraction contains the agent or agents responsible for the beneficial properties observed and referred to above. This acid whey fraction may also be added to syrups, ice cream mixes, candy, beverages or cattle feeds. See Kosikowski, Having now generally described this invention, the same will be further described by reference to certain specific examples which are provided herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified. Five Holstein cows were immunized against Escherichia coli American Type Culture Strain No. 13076 . The primary immunization was accomplished by intramuscular injection of a vaccine containing heat killed In each case there was a significant increase in the milk titer against The skimmed powdered milk induced by the method outlined above was tested for beneficial properties using a number of tests, The identical experiment as described in Example 1 was undertaken with the exception that a polyvalent vaccine comprised of the bacterial strains listed below in Table 2 was used as the selected antigen. The different bacterial strains were combined by mixing equal weights of the lyophilized bacterial cells and diluting the mixture in saline to obtain a concentration identical to that used in Example 1. Results of the tests on milk produced using these selected antigens were positives It should be noted here that the milk produced in this Example is identical to that produced in a preferred embodiment of the invention disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,284,623. This patent discloses that the milk has anti inflammatory properties. A strain of It should be noted here that the milk produced in this Example is identical to the caries inhibiting milk disclosed by The polyvalent vaccine shown below in Table 3 was utilized as in Example 2 to immunize a cow and obtain hyperimmune milk with cardiovascular effects. Nine, young adult female rabbits of the New Zealand White strain were used for this study. Rabbits were housed in the College of Medicine s Vivarium at the University of South Alabama in Mobile. The room in which the rabbits were kept was maintained at 72 C with 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of darkness during each 24 h period. Only one rabbit was housed in each cage. The rabbits were fed the diets below and sacrificed during the second and third weeks after end of the diets. The rabbits were divided into two groups. Both groups received a balanced laboratory chow After 3 months of drinking the dissolved, non fat dry milk Group I or the hyperimmune milk rabbits were weighed and anaesthetized by injecting sodium pentabarbital into an ear vein. The body weight of each rabbit at the time of sacrifice was compared to its body weight on the first day of the diet. There was no significant difference between the body weights of rabbits receiving hyperimmune milk and those receiving the non fat dry milk. Hearts and the great vessels at the base of the heart were removed and prepared for study by several different procedures. Specimens were coded so that the investigator was unaware whether the material was control or experimental. For SEM, the inner endocardial surface of the heart was scanned using variable magnifications X10 40,000 . Areas of specific interest minimum of 5 randomly selected areas heart were then studied and photographed. Control hearts, in contrast to experimental hearts, showed extensive endothelial damage that varied in extent and severity. Craters or holes were present where one or more cells had degenerated and detached. Small holes were present in many cells. In some instances, a fibrin like substance mixed with blood cells and platelets was around or within the craters. Such sites were interpreted as stages in the formation of atheromatous thrombi. Loss of endothelial cells as evident in the control hearts would expose blood in the heart chambers to endocardial connective tissue and lead to the formation of thrombi. SEM showed that hyperimmune milk protected rabbit endothelial cells and prevented thrombogenesis. TEM showed major differences in the blood vessels of control and experimental hearts. Significant pathological features of blood vessels in control hearts included 1 large lipid droplets that sometimes occluded vascular lumina 2 endothelial degeneration 3 multiple, small lipid vacuoles in endothelial cells 4 single or multiple large lipid droplets that almost filled the cytoplasm of endothelial cells 5 foam cells laden with lipid 6 strong tendency of fibrin and platelets to adhere to the luminal surface of endothelial cells. All of the aforementioned derrangements accompany the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Coronary, renal, and cerebral arteries are known to be especially susceptible to atherosclerosis. There is focal involvement of the blood vessels, rather than total involvement throughout their length. The disease was not found in blood vessels from representative areas of the hearts of rabbits who drank immune milk. Portions of hearts from all control rabbits were divided 1 part was embedded in paraffin, and 1 part in plastic. Sections of plastic specimens cut at a thickness of 1 micrometer and stained with toluidine blue or paragon clearly showed two differences between control and experimental hearts 1 lipid was present in the lumina of some blood vessels of control hearts, and 2 some cardiac muscle fibers of control hearts were filled with lipid. Hearts from rabbits who drank immune milk did not manifest these features. Lipids were localized by two standard methods, Oil Red O and Sudan Black B. Both methods selectively demonstrate lipids in sections of frozen tissue. Each method showed lipid deposits in the tunica intima and tunica media of blood vessels in control hearts. These two tunics of control aortas were particularly heavily infiltrated with lipid. Tunica intimas of blood vessels in control rabbits contained thickenings associated with lipid that were typical of atherosclerosis. Coronary blood vessels from rabbits on hyperimmune milk, however, lacked atherosclerotic lipid deposits. Activities of the following enzymes were studied and evaluated in frozen sections of control and experimental rabbit hearts 1 acid phosphatase, 2 alkaline phosphatase, 3 isocitrate dehydrogenase, 4 succinate dehydrogenase, and 5 cytochrome oxidase. The activity of acid phosphatase was also determined biochemically. Of the several enzymes whose activities were evaluated, only cyrochrome oxidase an enzyme associated with aging showed significantly greater activity in control hearts than in experimental hearts. It is noteworthy that control hearts contained foci of cardiac muscle fibers, measuring about 1 mm in diameter, that stained intensely. Such areas were evidently very rich in mitochondria and may represent focal areas of aging. Analysis of the serum cholesterol levels in the rabbits of these studies revealed a marked decrease in serum cholesterol levels. Those control rabbits fed a diet without hyperimmune milk demonstrate an average serum cholesterol level of 4,450 mg dl. In contrast, the rabbits fed a diet of hyperimmune milk exhibited a serum cholesterol level average less than half of that figure, 2,167 mg dl. This is believed the mechanism whereby the physiological improvements discussed above are affected. Clinical studies have now been initiated for three human subjects, to determine the value of the hyperimmune milk of this invention in the reduction of plasma lipid values. Although by no means complete, these studies clearly indicate the value of the hyperimmune milk diet in reducing lipid values. Although not tested against controls for obvious reasons, beginning lipid values have been markedly reduced for all three subjects. The exact lipid values are reflected in Table 4.
