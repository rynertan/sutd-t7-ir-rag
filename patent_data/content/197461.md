# Ultra fine polymer particle, composite material thereof, and methods of preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Disclosed are a cumulatable ultra fine polymer particle consisting of one molecular chain of a polymer, a composite material comprising the cumulatable ultra fine polymer particles cumulated on a substrate, and methods of prepara tion thereof. In the composite material, the cumulatable ultra fine polymer particles each of which consists of one molecular chain are cumlulated on the substrate in a ratio of area occupied with the ultra fine polymer particles of at least 10 . The cumulatable ultra fine polymer particle consisting of one molecular chain of the polymer is prepared by spreading a dilute solution of the polymer at the interface between the atmosphere and a subphase solution having a weak affinity for the polymer, and thereafter evaporating a spreading solvent or dissolving it into the subphase. The composite material comprising the ultra fine polym er particles cumulated on the substrate is produced by transferring onto the substrate the ultra fine polymer parti cles formed on the subphase solution in a contacting manner. The cumulatable ultra fine polymer particles may further be cumulated thereon in multi layers. The composite material of the present invention is useful, for example, for separation membranes and anti thrombogenic materials.
