# Polymer film with conductive pattern and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A polymer film with a conductive electrode has an in sulated polymer film 7 with an electrically conductive pat tern 6 containing an electrically conductive polymer of an aromatic compound, the conductive pattern being formed on at least one major surface of the insulated film, and having an internal portion extending into the film from said surface.
