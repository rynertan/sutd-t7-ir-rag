## Description
Marine Paint This invention relates to marine anti fouling paints generally used as top coat paints for ships hulls. The growth of marine organisms on the sub marine parts of a ship s hull increases the frictional resistance of the hull to passage through water, leading to increased fuel consumption and or a reduction in the speed of the ship.Marine growths accumulate so rapidly that the remedy of cleaning and repainting as required is impractical. In general the extent of fouling is limited by applying to the hull a top coat incorporating anti fouling agents. The anti fouling agents are biocides which are freed from the surface of the paint over a period in concentrations lethal to marine organisms on the hulls surface. The anti fouling paint fails only when the concentration of biocide available at the paint surface falls below the lethal concentrations, and with marine paints up to two years useful life can be expected.The better anti fouling paints are thus effective in dealing with gross infestation of hulls for considerable periods but a top coat paint of a ship s sub marine surface has irregularities from its method of application and is furthermore subject to break down and delamination during service, increasing the roughness of the hull, so that the performance of the ship falls off even when fouling is prevented. Our British patent specification 1,457,590 describes and claims a paint based on a film forming copolymer containing units of a triorganotin salt of an olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid. Upon contact with seawater it loses triorganotin ions by ion exchange with seawater. This generates a water soluble resin which essentially is a copolymer salt formed as a result of the depletion in the copolymer organotin content and exchange with metal ions present in seawater. This gradual dissolution of the copolymer means that a fresh anti fouling paint surface is continuously revealed, prolonging the time for which biocide release at the paint surface is maintained above the lethal concentration. The paint of British patent specification 1,457,590 has the remarkable property that relatively moving seawater smooths the surface of the paint, removing excrescences composed of the paint. When it is painted on a ship, the painted sub marine surface of the ship at least preserves its initial smoothness and may become smoother during the ordinary traffic of the ship, leading to improved efficiency.The smoothing of the paint is inevitably accompanied by the release of the triorganotin ions into the surrounding seawater.In most circumstances, this is useful because the triorganotin ions are effective anti fouling agents. However, triorganotin compounds are both expensive and strongly biocidal and it would be desirable in many circumstances to reduce the usage of triorganotin groups or avoid them altogether while obtaining the benefits of the smoothing of the paint in service. We have now found surprisingly that certain polymers of more simple acrylate esters can be used as the basis of marine paints which are gradually planed away as a ship moves through seawater. A marine paint according to the present invention comprises a film forming acrylic polymer and a metalliferous pigment which is sparingly soluble in seawater. The acrylic polymer comprises 20 to 100 per cent by weight of monomer units A selected from methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate units, 0 to 45 per cent by weight of monomer units B of a triorganotin salt of an olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid, and 0 to 80 per cent by weight of units C which are alkyl methacrylate units having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl group or styrene units, monomer units A and B and C forming at least 80 per cent by weight of the polymer and the balance of the polymer, if any, being units of at least one other olefinically unsaturated comonomer. The film forming polymers used in the present invention are slowly hydrolysed in seawater so that they are gradually removed by motion through seawater. No inactive layer devel ops at the surface of the paint, and the paint at least maintains its initial smoothness in the manner shown in Figures 2A to 2D of British patent specification 1,457,590. In a preferred form of the invention the monomer units A form 30 to 100 per cent by weight of the acrylic polymer and the monomer units A and monomer units C together form at least 90 per cent, for example 100 per cent, by weight of the polymer. Such film forming polymers which are free from monomer units B do not release biocidal groups into the seawater and should be used in conjunction with a biocide for marine fouling organisms. This can be chosen for the particular waters which the ship is likely to encounter. The biocide can be in the form of a sparingly soluble metalliferous pigment such as cuprous oxide or an organic biocide can be used in the paint. The polymer preferably contains at least 10 per cent by weight of the monomer units C since such polymers form stronger films. The C14 alkyl methacrylate units are preferred, particularly methyl methacrylate units. The olefinically unsaturated comonomer, if used, can be an acrylic monomer, for example propyl acrylate, amyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, hexyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile, or a vinyl monomer, for example vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl chloride or vinyl pyridine. The polymer can contain monomer units conferring increased water reactivity, particularly when the polymer contains a relatively high proportion of monomer unit C , which tend to inhibit dissolution of the polymer.For example the polymer can contain up to 20 per cent by weight o maleic or itaconic anhydride, acrylamide, methacrylamide orN vinyl pyrrolidone units or up to 5 per cent by weight, preferably 2 per cent or less, of acrylic, methacrylic or itaconic acid units. Care must be taken to avoid gelation of the paint when using a copolymer containing free acid monomer units. The paint of the invention can be one which releases biocidal triorganotin ions by hydrolysis from a polymer and is smoothed by passage through seawater, but which is more economical in the use of triorganotin. In this case the film forming acrylic polymer preferably comprises 20 70 per cent by weight of monomer units A , up to 45 per cent by weight, for example 10 45 per cent, of monomer units B and 20 50 per cent by weight of monomer units C .The monomer units B are preferably of the formula R3SnOOCCR CHR where each R is an alkyl radical containing 2 to 8 carbon atoms or an aryl or aralkyl radical, R is H or CH3 and R isH or COOSnR3. The groups R attached to the tin atom can be different but are preferably the same, for example R3Sn can be tributyl tin, tripropyl tin, tribenzyl tin, triphenyl tin, tritolyl tin or trihexyl tin. The carboxylate group OOCCR CHR is preferably acrylate, methacrylate or maleate. The film forming polymer can be prepared by addition polymerisation of the appropriate monomers in the appropriate proportions at polymerisation conditions using a free radical catalyst such as benzoyl peroxide or azobisisobutyronitrile in an organic solvent such as xylene, toluene, butyl acetate, nbutanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, cyclohexanone, 2 methoxyethanol, 2 butoxyethanol and or 2 ethoxyethyl acetate. Polymerisation is preferably at a temperature in the range 70 1000C. Within this range the use of higher temperatures produces polymers of lower molecular weight. Polymerisation may be carried out by heating all the polymer ingredients in the solvent at the required temperature or by gradually adding a mixture of the monomers and catalyst to treated solvent. The latter procedure produces polymers of lower molecular weight. A chain transfer agent such as a mercaptan can also be used to produce polymers of lower molecular weight. For a given proportion of monomers the paint tends to dissolve in and become smoothed by relatively moving sea water more rapidly if the polymer has a lower molecular weight, and such polymers may be preferred when using a high proportion of monomer units C , particularly if monomer units C comprise styrene. Mixtures of polymers of different composition, or of higher and lower molecular weight polymers, can be used. Alternatively the paint can be an aqueous emulsion paint based on a film forming acrylic polymer prepared by emulsion polymerisation. In this case the monomers are preferably chosen so that the polymer has a glass transition temperature 0 of 5 25 C. Emulsion copolymers preferably include no more than 40 per cent by weight of monomerunits C . The metalliferous pigment sparingly soluble in seawater is exemplified by cuprous thiocyanate, cuprous oxide, zinc oxide, cupric acetate meta arsenate, zinc chromate, zinc dimethyl dithiocarbamate and zinc diethyl dithiocarbamate.The paint preferably includes a least one metalliferous pigment selected from zinc oxide, cuprous oxide and cuprous thiocyanate and pigments whose seawater solubility is similar to theirs. These pigments have a seawater solubility such that the pigment particles do not survive at the paint surface. The pigment has the effect of inducing the overall smoothing which the relatively moving seawater exerts on the paint film, minimising localised erosion and preferentially removing excrescences formed during the application of the paint. Mixtures of sparingly soluble pigments can be used, for example zinc oxide which is most effective at inducing the gradual dissolution of the paint,can be mixed with cuprous oxide, cuprous thiocyanate or zinc dimethyl dithiocarbamate which are more effective marine biocides. Such mixtures preferably comprise up to 75 per cent by volume zinc oxide and 25 100 per cent by volume cuprous oxide or cuprous thiocyanate. Zinc dimethyl dithiocarbamate and zinc diethyl dithiocarbamate are somewhat less soluble than cuprous oxide or thiocyanate. If used, they preferably form up to 75 per cent by volume of the pigment, with at least 25 per cent by volume of the pigment being zinc oxide. The paint composition can additionally contain a pig ment which is highly insoluble in seawater, such as titanium dioxide or ferric oxide. Such highly insoluble pigments can be used at up to 40 per cent by weight of the total pigment component of the paint. The highly insoluble pigment has the effect of retarding the dissolution of the paint. The proportion of pigment to polymer is generally such as to give a pigment volume concentration of at least 25 per cent, preferably at least 35 per cent, in the dry paint film.The upper limit of pigment concentration is the critical pigment volume concentration. Paints of pigment volume concentration about 50 per cent, for example, have been found very effective for smoothing in seawater and preventing fouling. Paints according to the invention may include a plasticiser although this is not usually necessary. Examples of plasticisers are tritolyl phosphate, diisooctyl phthalate, tributyl phosphate, butyl benzyl phthalate, dibutyl tartrate, Lutenal A25 polyether and hydrophobic organic plasticisers which retard the rate of dissolution of the paint, such as chlorinated diphenyl, for example Aroclor 1254 sold byMonsanto Ltd., chlorinated paraffin wax, for example Cereclor 48 and Cereclor 70 sold by I.C.I. Ltd., diphenyl ether, dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane or low molecular weight polybutenes such as Hyvis 05 sold by B.P. Ltd. Many of the metalliferous pigments sparingly soluble in seawater have biocidal activity, particularly copper compounds such as cuprous thiocyanate, cupric acetate meta arsenate and cuprous oxide, and also zinc oxide to a lesser extent. Even when the polymer contains no triorganotin salt units B the biocidal effect of these sparingly soluble pigments, particularly cuprous oxide, may be sufficient so that the paint needs no further biocide, for example for use on the flat bottom of very large tankers, where fouling is less likely to occur.We believe that the self smoothing action of the paint increases its resistance to fouling compared to a conventional paint releasing biocide at the same rate this effect is more marked with increasing rate of dissolution of the paint, as for example when the film forming polymer contains a high proportion of methyl or ethyl acrylate and the sparingly soluble pigment includes zinc oxide. The paint can contain an added biocide effective against seaweed and barnacles. Triorganotin salts and oxides such as triphenyltin fluoride, tributyl tin fluoride, tributyl tin dibromosuccinate, triphenyltin chloride, triphenyltin hydroxide and tributyltin oxide are effective marine biocides and can be used in paints according to the invention, particularly where the polymer contains no monomer units B . A paint according to the invention comprising a tin free polymer, a pigment such as cuprous oxide and a small proportion of a triorganotin salt up to 25 per cent by volume based on the pigment may have antifouling and smoothing properties equal to an organotin copolymer paint of much higher total organotin content. Alternatively a mixture of organotinfree and organotin polymers can be used. In some cases it will be desired to avoid completely the release of triorganotin ions. Examples of other biocides effective as antifouling agents are di thiocarbamate derivatives such as cuprous ethylene bis di thiocarbamate or 2 N,N dimethyl thiocarbamyl thio 5 nitro thiazole, substituted isothiazolones particularly halogenated N substituted isothiazolones, tetramethyl thiuram disulphide and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane which also acts as a hydrophobic organic retarder . The invention is illustrated by the following Examples Example 1 Methyl methacrylate 7.6g 0.076 mole and methyl acrylate 68.4g 0.795 mole were dissolved in a mixture of xylene 85.4g and cyclohexanone 36.6g . Azobisisobutyronitrile AIBN 2.0g 0.012 mole was added and the solution was heated to 800C. The polymerisation reaction was conducted with stirring at this temperature. There was an exotherm in the first 20 minutes of the reaction. The course of the polymerisation was followed by monitoring the change in the refractive index. No further significant change was observed after 3 hours and the solution was then heated to 1000 C for a period of 30 minutes to destroy any residual activity ofAIBN. The product was a 36.0 per cent by volume solids solution of a copolymer of 10 aser cent by weight methyl methacrylate and 90 per cent by weight methyl acrylate. 88.7 g of the copolymer solution produced above was mixed with cuprous oxide 71.5g and Aerosil colloidal silica l.3g and milled overnight to produce a paint of pigment volume concentration 35 per cent. Example 2 88.7g of the copolymer solution produced as in Example 1 was mixed with cuprous thiocyanate 35.2g and Aerosil colloidal silica l.3g and milled overnight. Example 3 88.7g of the copolymer solution produced as in Example 1 was mixed with zinc oxide 33.8g , cuprous oxide 35.7g and Aerosil colloidal silica 1.3g and milled overnight.The paint contained ZnO Cu2O in 50 50 ratio by volume. Example 4 88.7g copolymer solution produced as in Example 1 was mixed with zinc oxide 50.7g , cuprous oxide 17.9g andAerosil colloidal silica 1.3g and milled overnight. The paint contained ZnO Cu2O in 75 25 ratio, by volume. The smoothing performance of paints in relatively moving seawater can be tested in the apparatus described inBritish Patent Specification 1,457,590 with reference to Figures 7A and 7B. A disc having a diameter of 23 cm is coated in radial stripes with the paints under test. The stripes are applied by a standardised applicator adapted to deposit a film 20u thick wet thickness . The disc is immersed in flowing seawater and rotated at a peripheral speed of 33 knots. During this test the paint films under test are planed away, eventually to the extent that the underlying substrate is revealed. There is always some variation in the thickness of the paint film within each stripe so that the stripe of paint does not suddenly vanish an increasing proportion of the substrate is revealed over time. When the substrate is revealed over 50 per cent of the area of the stripe it is a good approximation to say that the paint film in the stripe has lost by planing the original average dry thickness of the paint film in the stripe. The time in days to achieve this rod50,, is a measure of the rate of planing of the paint in relatively moving seawater. The surface of the paint film in each stripe should be examined during the test to note whther it is smooth and firm. Paint films according to the invention which at least retain their initial smoothness must be distinguished from paint films which are removed over at least a portion of the stripe by flaking or localised erosion causing roughening or by separation from the disc. The above test can be used to give an absolute rate of planing of the paint film, but the temperature, composition and flow rate of the seawater can effect the result. The test is preferably used as a comparison in which one of the stripes painted on the disc is an antifouling paint known to have the desired rate of dissolution in relatively moving seawater. A disc was prepared having 2 stripes each of the paints of Examples 1, 2 and 3, one stripe of the paint of Example 4, 2 stripes of a commercially successful self polishing paintX and 2 stripes of paint Y comprising by weight 36.1 per cent of a 40 per cent by volume sdlution of a 60 40 tributyltin methacrylate methyl methacrylate copolymer, 45.8 per centZnO, 0.7 per cent colloidal silica, O.9 per cent bentonite, 0.4 per cent tributyltin oxide and 12.4 per cent xylene. This paint is known from British Patent Specification 1,457,590 to be smoothed away during motion through seawater at a dissolution rate which is generally too fast for optimum commercial use, but which can be retarded to the optimum rate by a hydrophobic organic material. All the paints were observed to be planed away during rotation in seawater. The stripes of comparison paint X had an average D50 of 15.5 days and those of comparison paint Y had a D50 of 3 days. The average D50 of the paints of Examples 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively were 17 days, 28 days, 9.5 days and 5.8 days.These results indicate that the paints of Examples 1, 2 and 3 have a rate of dissolution in relatively moving seawater which would be sufficient to give appreciable smoothing of the paint film but not too fast for commercial use. The paint of Example 4 dissolved somewhat faster than would be desired in commercial practice but slower than comparison paint Y, indicating that its dissolution could be retarded to a commercial rate by the addition of a minor amount of an organic hydrophobic retarder. All the rates of dissolution were compatible with the release of sufficient of an added biocide without forming a leached inactive outer layer of paint. Example 5 Methyl methacrylate 22.8g 0.228 mole and methyl acrylate 53.2g 0.619 mole were dissolved in xylene 122g . AIBN 2.0g 0.012 mole was added and the solution was heated to 80 C. The polymerisation reation was conducted with stirring at this temperature. There was a mild exotherm in the first 20 minutes of the reaction. The course of the polymerisation was followed by monitoring the change in the refractive index.No further significant change was observed after 4 hours and the solution was then heated to 1000C for a period of 30 minutes to destroy any residual activity of AIBN. The product was a 37.6 per cent by volume solids solution of a copolymer of 30 Per cent by weight methyl methacrylate and 70 per cent by weight methyl acrylate. 84.4g of the copolymer solution priduced above was mixed with cuprous oxide 7.5g , Aerosil colloidal silica l.3g and xylene l.5g and milled overnight. Example 6 84.4g of the copolymer solution produced as in Example 5 was mixed with zinc oxide 33.8g , cuprous oxide 35.7g ,Aerosil colloidal silica l.3g and xylene 1.5g and milled overnight. The product contained ZnO Cu20 in 50 50 ratio, by volume. Example 7 Copolymer solution 84.4g produced as in Example 5 was mixed with zinc oxide 50.7g , cuprous oxide 17.9g , Aerosil colloidal silica l.3g and xylene 1.5g and milled overnight. The paint contained ZnO Cu20 in 75 25 ratio, by volume. Example 8 A 36 per cent by volume solids solution of poly methyl acrylate in a 70 30 mixture of xylene and cyclohexanone was prepared by the procedure of Example 1. This solution was milled with cuprous oxide and 0.8 per cent by weight colloid silica to form a paint having a pigment volume concentration of 35 per cent and a solids content of 37 per cent by volume. Examples 9 and 10 The poly methyl acrylate solution of Example 8 was milled with zinc oxide and cuprous oxide in differing propor tions, and with 0.8 per cent by weight colloidal silica in each case to form two paints, each having a pigment volume concentration of 35 per cent and a solids content of 37 per cent by volume. The paint of Example 9 had ZnO Cu20 ratio of 50 50 by volume and the paint of Example 10 had aZnO Cu2O ratio of 75 25 by volume. Example 11 A 36 per cent by volume solids solution in xylene of a copolymer of 70 per cent by weight methyl methacrylate and 30 per cent by weight methyl acrylate was prepared by the procedure of Example 5. This solution was milled with zinc oxide and cuprous oxide and 0.8 per cent by weight colloidal silica to form a paint having a pigment volume concentration of 35 per cent, a ZnO Cu20 ratio of 75 25 by volume and a solids content of 37 r centby volume. The paints of Examples 5 to 11 were tested in the rotating disc test described above. A disc was prepared having 2 stripes each of the paints of Examples 5, 6, 7 and 9, one stripe each of the paints of Examples 8, 10 and 11 and 2 stripes each of comparison paints X and Y described above. All the paints were observed to be planed away during rotation in seawater. The stripes of comparison paint X had a D50 of 12 days and those of comparison paint Y had a D50 of 2 days. The average D50 of the paints of Examples 5 to 11 were as follows Example No. D50 days 5 35 6 31 7 6.2 8 21 9 9 10 4.5 11 10.4 These results indicate that the paints of Examples 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11 have a rate of dissolution in relatively moving seawater which would be sufficient to give appreciable smoothing of the paint film but not too fast for commercial use.The paints of Examples 7 and 10 dissolved somewhat faster than would be desired in commercial practice but slower than comparison paint Y, indicating that their dissolution could be retarded to a commercial rate by the addition of a minor amount of an organic hydrophobic retarder. All the rates of dissolution were compatible with the release of sufficient of an added biocide without forming a leached inactive outer layer of paint.

Example 29 171g methyl acrylate and 19g methacrylamide were copolymerised in 30Qg cyclohexanone using lOg AIBN catalyst under the procedure of Example 1 to produce a 42.1 per cent by volume solution of a 90 10 by weight copolymer of methyl acrylate methacrylamide. 136.5g of the copolymer solution was mixed with 147.5g cuprous oxide, 46.5g zinc oxide, 3g Aerosil colloidal silica, 5.5g bentonite, 1.5g n butanol and 24g cyclohexanone to produce a paint of P.V.C. 50 per cent. Example 30 78g methyl methacrylate, 39g methyl acrylate and 78g tributyltin methacrylate were copolymerised in 222g xylene using 5g AIBN and the procedure of Example 5 to produce a 39.2 per cent by volume solution of a 40 20 40 by weight copolymer of methyl methacrylate methyl acrylate tributyltin methacrylate. 163g of this copolymer solution was mixed with 66g zinc oxide, 69.5g cuprous oxide, 2g Aerosil colloidal silica, 3.5g bentonite, 1.3g n butanol and 7g xylene to produce a paint of P.V.C. 35 per cent. Example 31 226g xylene was heated to 90 C. 74g methyl methacrylate was mixed with 37g methyl acrylate, 148g of a 50 per cent by weight solution of tributyltin methacrylate in xylene and 15g AIBN and the mixture was added to the hot xylene over 1 hour to produce a 36.7 per cent by volume solution of a copolymer having the same weight ratio of monomers as that of Example 30 but a lower molecular weight. 170.5g of this copolymer solution was mixed with 66g zinc oxide, 69.5g cuprous oxide, 2g Aerosil colloidal silica, 3.5g bentonite, and 1.5g n butanol to produce a paint of P.V.C.36.5 per cent. Examples 32 33 Using the procedure of Example 30 copolymer solutions were produced from the following monomers Example No. Methyl Methyl Tributyltin methacrylate acrylate methacrylate 32 78g 40 wt. 78g 40 wt. 39g 20 wt. 33 78g 40 wt. 97.5g 50 wt. 19.5g 10 wt. Paints of P.V.C. 35 per cent were prepared from each of these copolymer solutions using the same pigment and other ingredients as in Example 30. Example 34 68g methyl methacrylate, 34g methyl acrylate and 68g tributyltin methacrylate were copolymerised in 300g xylene at 800C for three hours using 5g AIBN catalyst and 25g dodecyl mercaptan chain transfer agent to produce a 37.7 per cent by volume solution of a copolymer having the same monomer weight ratio as that of Example 30 but with a lower molecular weight. 164.5g of this copolymer solution was mixed with 132g zinc oxide, 2g Aerosil colloidal silica, 3.5g bentonite, l.3g n butanol and 3g xylene to produce a paint of P.V.C. 35 per cent. Example 35 104g ethyl acrylate, 42g methyl methacrylate and 3g methacrylic acid were dispersed in 426g water with 12g of a 10 per cent by weight aqueous solution of ammonium persulphate, 12g of a 10 per cent by weight aqueous solution of sodium metabisulphate and 4g of a 0.1 per cent by weight aqueous solution of ferrous sulphate using 5g sodium lauryl sulphate. The emulsion was heated to 30 C to induce the exothermic polymerisation reaction and then held at 800C for fifteen minutes before cooling to 25 0C. A mixture of the same quantities of monomers, initiator system and surfactant as used above was then added and the reaction mixture was held at 800C for one hour to produce a 38.5 per cent by volume emulsion of a 70 28 2 by weight copolymer of ethyl acrylate methyl methacrylate methacrylic acid. 64.2g water was mixed with 4.7g Calgon PT sequestering agent, 19.2g Synperonic N wetting agent, 5g Aerosil colloidal silica, 4g Bezaloid 677 defoamer and 31. 4g of a 5 per cent by volume aqueous dispersion of a thixotropic agent. 250.5g cuprous oxide and 236.7g zinc oxide were dispersed in the aqueous mixture and 374.5g of the copolymer emulsion was added followed by 50g ethylene glycol to produce an emulsion paint of P.V.C. 31.5 per cent. Example 36 A paint was prepared from the emulsion copolymer ofExample 35 using the same procedure except that 16.4g of the thixotropic agent dispersion was used to replace 16.4g of the water and the pigments used were 375.8g cuprous oxide and 118.4g zinc oxide. The paints of Examples 12 to 36 were tested in the rotating disc apparatus of Figures 7A and 7B of BritishPatent 1,457,590. In these tests the stripes of paints according to Examples 12 to 36 were applied more thickly for example at 100 micron dry film thickness than in the tests on the paints of Examples 1 to 11 and the average thickness of the paint film in each stripe was measured before and after 2 or 4 weeks rotation in seawater. In each case the rate of dissolution of the paint under test was compared to the rate of dissolution of a commercially successful selfpolishing paint paint X of Examples 1 to 11 . This paint has a dissolution rate in service for example on a tanker trad ing between the Middle East and Northern Europe of 8 microns per month. The results obtained are shown in Table 1.

Most of the paints dissolved at about the same rate as paint X or somewhat slower indicating that they had a rate of dissolution compatible with both economic use of paint and release of sufficient biocide.The paints of Examples 12, 17, 20 and 34 dissolved somewhat faster than would be desired in commercial practice but could be retarded by the addition of a minor amount of an organic hydrophobic retarder. The paints of Examples 12 to 26 were tested for antifouling activity by applying each of them to a plaque over a vinyl resin tar anti corrosive paint, mounting the plaques on a panel and immersing the panel from a raft in the riverYealm estuary off Southern England between May and September.Each panel also included plaques coated with a non toxic control which became heavily fouled with seaweed and some animal life within 4 weeks , three conventional copper based antifouling paints A, B and C and a tin copolymer paint D pigmented with cuprous oxide. Paint A was based on a calcium zinc tall oil fatty acid salt and contained 10 per cent by weight cuprous oxide. Paint B was similar but contained some rosin binder and 24 per cent by weight cuprous oxide. Paint C was a 2 pack chlorinated rubber antifouling paint containing 41 per cent by weight cuprous oxide and 3 per cent tributyltin oxide. The antifouling performance of the paints under test is shown in Table 2. The degree of fouling is rated as follows O no fouling or algal slime no weed or animal fouling but some algal slime no weed or animal fouling but considerable adherent slime small patches of stunted weed fouling considerable fouling by stunted weed heavy fouling by weed and or animal Table 2Paint of No. of Degree ofExample No. weeks fouling immersion 12 16 0 13 16 0 14 16 0 15 16 0 16 16 17 16 0 18 16 0 19 16 20 16 21 11 0 22 11 0 23 11 24 11 25 11 26 11 0 Non toxic control 11 or 16Comparison paint A 16Comparison paint B 16Comparison paint C 16 Comparison paint D 16 0 Comparison paints A and B started to show fouling by weed within 8 weeks.
