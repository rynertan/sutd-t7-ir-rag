## Description
The present invention relates to a method of producing an antigenic preparation, capable of generating in vertebrates antibodies which will bind with Type 4 fimbrial antigens of bacterial pathogens, and to the antigenic preparation itself. The specific example which will be used to illustrate this invention is that of the production of fimbrial antigens effective as a vaccine against In the case of There are at least 8 or 9 major serogroups of The fimbriae have been shown to be the antigen involved in the specific agglutination reaction, and correspondingly the range of effective immunity conferred by vaccination with whole cells or fimbrial preparations is restricted to the serogroup serotype involved. The available commercial vaccines against footrot consist of a mixture of whole cells of different The high cost of producing footrot vaccines is directly related to the difficulty of culturing fimbriate Applicants co pending Australian patent application No. 34979 84 describes the production of the This invention describes the further development of this process, in that it describes the production of supramolecular, extracellular fimbrial structures from recombinant bacterial hosts. This provides substantial advantages in terms of both the antigenicity of the preparation for vaccine purposes and the practicalities and economics of antigen production. The invention makes use of a compatible fimbrial assembly system in a suitable Type 4 fimbrial host, such as The present invention provides a method for the production of an antigenic preparation for use in raising antibodies active against a species of bacteria naturally producing Type 4 fimbriae, comprising culturing genetically engineered aerobic or facultatively anaerobic Type 4 fimbriate host cells, containing the genes encoding the fimbrial structural sub unit antigens of at least one strain of the said species of bacteria and an endogenous compatible system for the morphogenetic assembly of Type 4 fimbriae, such that mature fimbriae are produced as extraceullular structures and harvesting the whole or a part of the fimbriae substantially free of the host cells. In another aspect the invention provides a genetically engineered aerobic or facaltatively anaerobic Type 4 bacteria, the bacteria being characterised in that it contains exogenous genes encoding the fimbrial structural sub unit antigens of at least one strain of bacteria which naturally produces Type 4 fimbriae such that expression of the exogenous genes results in the production of fimbriae of the at least one strain as extracellular structures. We have found, using Western transfer matrix analyses, wherein fimbriae from a range of different Applicants co pending Australian patent application No. 34979 84 describes the production of the structural subunit antigen of The production of the antigen in the form of mature fimbriae has significant immunological and technical benefits with respect to the effectiveness of the vaccine, the simplicity of its components, and the ease and economics of its manufacture, based on the following considerations The biosynthesis and assembly of fimbrial strands i.e. morphogenetic expression, appears to require the participation of several genes, apart from that encoding the structural subunit itself. For example, studies of the plasmid and chromosomal encoded Type 1 or Type 2 fimbrial systems of uropathogenic and enterotoxigenic strains of The gene encoding the 17kD structural subunit of the The problem of obtaining morphogenetic expression of fimbriae in recombinant hosts may be approached by attempting to clone and express the other genes required. The initial strategy here involves extension of the cloned sequences flanking the structural subunit gene, on the assumption that the genes are in fact clustered as in The problem of morphogenetic expression of fimbriae may also be approached by genetic or molecular genetic complementation of the fimbrial subunit gene with a compatible assembly system derived in whole or part from other bacteria. Although this approach may involve gene isolation and or modification as outlined above, it has the advantage that it potentially provides the simplest solution to the problem. Attempts to complement missing functions by subcloning the these fimbrial subunits occurs primarily within the carboxy terminal two thirds of the protein. Intraspecific variation i.e. between different serotypes also occurs in this region, and involves not only amino acid substitutions, but also small in frame insertions and deletions. In Type 4 fimbriae are herein defined as those fimbriae which i are commonly found in bacterial species exhibiting the phenomenon known as twitching motility, although this may not always be present see below ii have a polar or polar like location on the surface of the cell and iii possess a highly conserved sequence in the amino terminal region of the structural subunit The brackets indicate that either one of the enclosed residues may be present at that position. These pairs are conservative, in the sense that each of the amino acids in the pair has a similar structure and properties e.g. isoleucine valine I V , isoleucine leucine I L , glutamine asparagine Q N , arginine lysine R K , and to a lesser extent, alanine serine A S . It should be noted that while twitching motility is usually exhibited by strains containing Type 4 fimbriae, this is not always or necessarily the case. For example, some mutant strains of The activity of the antigenic preparation may be exhibited as the ability to generate antibodies or some other immune response The source of the fimbrial subunit gene may be any species or strain thereof which possess Type 4 fimbriae. There may be present in the host organism the fimbrial subunit gene from a number of different Type 4 fimbriate bacteria. In preferred embodiments of the invention the host organism contains the fimbrial subunit genes for a number of serotypes of a single Type 4 fimbriate species. The host cell may be any compatible species or strain which expresses Type 4 fimbriae and which is preferably an aerobe or facultative anerobe capable of being transformed with and maintaining a suitable plasmid vector coding at least for the fimbrial subunit gene. The host cell may contain the exogenous genes either in a plasmid or by insertion into its chromosome. The plasmid may be either exogenous or endogenous. In preferred embodiments of the invention the genes for the morphogenetic assembly of the fimbriae are endogenous to the host cell which is itself of a Type 4 fimbriate species. In other embodiments of the invention, however, the genes may be exogenous, being derived from the same species as the subunit genes or from another Type 4 fimbriate species. In a preferred embodiment a promoter is employed to increase the level of gene expression and may be any promoter active in the host species, with or without accompanying regulatory sequences. Preferred promoters include the P The antigenic preparations are preferably administered with a conventional adjuvant and carrier system when used as a vaccine. The following example is described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which The specific example used to illustrate this invention involves the morphogenetic expression of The The In the initial constructions, the 5.5kb The problem of the low expression of the The The presence of the All constructions, manipulations and analyses described above were carried out using standard genetic engineering techniques. pJSM202 was transformed into competent Several transformants were selected and all verified to contain pJSM202 by plasmid isolation and restriction analysis. This plasmid is therefore not lethal for Examination of The morphogenetic expression of For the analyses described below, the bacterial cells were cultured on solid media the host Morphogenetic expression of The assembly of These results were confirmed by Western transfer analysis of the fimbriae produced by the PKN Al cells, compared with those obtained from The production of Several other criteria were also used to verify the production of These results demonstrate that Similar results have been obtained using other fimbriate The insertion of pJSM202 into fimbriate The results presented herein substantiate our prediction that Type 4 fimbrial subunits from different bacterial species do share common topogenic signals for fimbrial morphogenesis, and may be interchanged among compatible hosts. This is certainly the case for There are several other modifications of the basic system which may be considered in particular circumstances. For example, in some cases it may be desirable to eliminate the expression of the endogenous fimbrial subunit produced by the host cell. This may be achieved by a variety of methods, including traditional mutant selection, transposon mutagenesis, or It will be recognized by persons skilled in the art that numerous other variations and modifications can be made to the invention as described above without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The efficacy of the fimbriae produced by the recombinant Cells were grown on agar plates and harvested by scraping into sterile phosphate buffered saline PBS . For fimbrial isolation, these cell suspensions were subjected to mechanical blending and the cells then removed by centrifugation. Fimbriae were recovered from the cell free supernatant by isoelectric precipitation with 0.1M Na acetate pH 4.5 or, in the case of Group 7, by precipitation with 0.1M MgCl₂. The fimbriae were then redissolved in sterile PBS, and purified by a further round of precipitation, by the method originally employed. The contents and purity of each of the antigen preparations used in the vaccination trial were then checked by electrophoretic display and Western transfer analysis, using anti Vaccines were prepared using a standard alum oil adjuvant system An appropriate amount of antigen was resuspended in sterile PBS, to which one seventh volume of 10 potash alum AlK SO₄ ₂ was added, and the pH adjusted to 6.2. One hundredth volume of Tween 80 was added, and the mixture emulsified with an equal volume of Freunds Incomplete Adjuvant. Each individual dose was presented in a volume of 2ml, and contained the amount of antigen specified in the table above. Each animal received two doses a primary vaccination, followed by a booster shot 28 days later. Four days after boosting, the animals were predisposed to challenge by standing in pens in damp conditions on wet mats . Challenge was artificially administered three days later i.e. one week after boost by applying cultured cells of The results of the vaccination trial clearly demonstrate that the recombinant fimbriae confer the same level of protection as
