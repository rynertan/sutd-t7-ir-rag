## Description
QUATERNARY AMMONIUM GERMICIDES The invention relates to an efficient disinfectant composition comprising a biocidal agent. Disinfectants or germicides are very widely used, and two classes may be mentioned. Phenolic compounds have only limited solubility in water and are therefore used in the form of aqueous emulsions.Long chain quaternary ammonium compounds generally have sufficient solubility to be used in aqueous solution.Since the organism to be killed is hydrophilic, it is generally accepted that the germicide should be presented in a hydrophilic,rather than a hydrophobic, medium. This invention is based on the surprising discovery that the germicidal activity of quaternary ammonium compounds can be enhanced by a factor of between two and three or even more in the presence of hydrocarbons or halocarbons,or mixtures of these. The invention therefore provides a germicidal composition, showing enhanced germicidal action, comprising a mixture of a quaternary ammonium compound and a hydrocarbon or halocarbon, or mixture of hydrocarbons and halocarbons. The nature of the germicidal agent is not critical, and any quaternary ammonium compound having germicidal properties may be used. In particular, compounds having three methyl groups and one longchain hydrocarbon group attached to nitrogen are suitable, for example dodecylbenzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride sold by us under the trade name Gloquat C. Other quaternary ammonium compounds include benzalkonium chloride Morpan BC , tetradecyl pyridinium bromide Morpan TPB and Cetrimide B.P. Morpan CHSA . The hydrocarbon may comprise any low molecular weight aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aro matic hydrocarbon which enhances germicidal activity.Suitable hydrocarbons include hexane, cyclohexane, toluene and tetralin. In a preferred embodiment, the solvent comprises tetralin. It is envisaged that the hydrocarbon may comprise a mixture of low and high molecular weight hydrocarbons. Satisfactory results have also been obtained withShellsol R and Coalite Aromatic Oil 131C. The halocarbon may comprise a low molecular weight halogenated aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, for example a chlorinated paraffin, such as trichlorethane, or a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon, such as chlorobenzene, or a mixture of chlorinated paraffin and chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon. The quaternary ammonium compound and the hydrocarbon or halocarbon are preferably present in the mixture in a weight ratio of from 1 19 to 4 l1particul arly from 1 9 to 1 2. This ratio is not very critical, but if too little hydrocarbon or halocarbon is used, the germicidal effect of the quaternary ammonium compound is not significantly enhanced and too much hydrocarbon or halocarbon does not further potentiate the germicide. The hydrocarbon or halocarbon does not itself exert any significant germicidal action. The composition may contain a surface active agent to ensure that a stable emulsion is formed in water. Other conventional ingredients may be present in conventional amounts, for example colours, scents, preservatives and buffers. The composition maybe supplied without added water, consisting essentially of the mixture of quaternary ammonium compound and hydrocarbon or halocarbon. Or it may be supplied as a concentrated aqueous emulsion or suspension for dilution prior to use. Prior to use, such compositions are diluted with water, e.g. to a quaternary ammonium compound concentration by weight of 1 100 to 1 2000. It is considered desirable that, upon dilution with water, the composition forms a stable emulsion and preferably the emulsion stability satisfies the BritishStandard Specification for Black and WhiteDisinfectant Fluids BS 2462 1961 . However, investigations indicate that the quality of the emulsion formed in water does not appear to influence the biocidal activity and so compositions which form a poor emulsion may also find useful applications. Germicidal compositions according to the invention are far more efficient than compositions based on the same biocidal agent but not containing any hydrocarbon or halocarbon. This new component has a definite synergistic effect on the activity of the biocidal agent. For example, in the preferred composition the presence of tetralin increases the biocidal effectiveness of Gloquat C by a factor of three. The reason for this synergistic effect is at present unknown. It appears that the property is possessed by low molecular weight aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and halocarbons. The following examples are included to illustrate the invention. In each of Examples 1 9 germicidal compositions were prepared according to the following general formulation by weight Gloquat C 20 Texofor M6 8 Pine Oil 5 Hydrocarbon halocarbon 67 That is, in each of these examples only the hydrocarbon halocarbon component was varied. After shaking, each composition was tested for biocidal effectiveness using the British Standard testBS 6471 for QAC disinfectant formulations Appendix I .The appearance of the formulation was also noted.Finally, the appearance and stability of a 5 emulsion in hard water 200 ppm CaCo3 was noted over a period of 6 hours. The results obtained being compared to theBlack White Disinfectant Fluids SpecificationBS 2462 1961 Appendix II . The results obtained are shown in Examples 1 9Example 1Hydrocarbon NoneChemical type Bactericidal figure 1 500Appearance of formulation Emulsion appearance Emulsion appearance after 6 hrs Example 2 Hydrocarbon Hexane Chemical type C6H14Bactericidal figure 1 1500Appearance of formulation Separates.

The results obtained in the above examples illustrate that both aliphatic and aromatic low molecular weight hydrocarbons and halocarbons increase the biocidal effectiveness of Gloquat C by a factor of between two and three. A synergistic effect is also produced by Coalite Aromatic Oil 131C and Shellsol R.The precise composition of these latter two oils is not known. The results also indicate that the quality of the emulsion formed in water does not effect the biocidal activity of the composition. For example, hexane forms a poor emulsion but nevertheless enhances the activity of Gloquat C.Example 10 The biocidal effectiveness of each of the following formulations was tested, using the aforementioned test, in order to establish the effects if any of the other ingredients present EMI7.1 tb SEP SEP by SEP weight tb Gloquat SEP C SEP 20 SEP 20 SEP SEP 20 tb Texofor SEP M SEP SEP 8 SEP 8 SEP 8 tb Gloquat SEP C SEP 20 SEP 20 SEP SEP 20 tb Texofor SEP M SEP 6 SEP SEP 8 SEP 8 SEP 8 tb Texofor SEP V SEP 27 SEP SEP SEP 20 SEP tb Coalite SEP Aromatic tb SEP Oil SEP 131 SEP C SEP SEP SEP 67 SEP 67 tb Pine SEP Oil SEP SEP SEP 5 SEP 5 SEP 5 tb Water SEP 80 SEP 67 SEP SEP tb Bactericidal SEP Figure SEP 1 500 SEP 1 500 SEP 1 75 SEP 1 1250 tb The results obtained clearly demonstrate two points i The Coalite oil and the pine oil do not produce a significant level of biocidal activity in the absence of Gloquat C. ii The addition of the Coalite oil has a marked synergistic effect on the biocidal activity of Gloquat C.
