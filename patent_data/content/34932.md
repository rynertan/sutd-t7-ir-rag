# Pilot valve for a main safety valve.

## Abstract
A pilot valve for assisting operation of a main valve to cause the main valve to open at a predetermined input pres sure, comprises a diaphragm 3 of which one face 32a is permanently subject to input pressure. The other face 3b defines a space 8 with a valve member 7 which is in com munication via a restricted passage 15 with input pressure and is connectable by a passage 16 to the main valve. The valve member 7 seats on a seat provided in a wall 5 and its other face 7a is subject to constant pressure. When the input pressure increases above a set level, the valve member 7 will open against a basing force placing the space 8 in com munication with atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pres sure is communicated by passage 16 to the main valve causing main valve to open. The valve member will be held in its open position until input pressure has dropped below the set pressure closing the main valve.

## Description
Improvements in and relating to valves The present invention relates to improvements in pilot valves for assisting operation of main valves. Vessels containing materials under superatmospheric pressure are normally provided with a safety valve which is arranged to open at a set pressure within the vessel. Particularly where the set pressure is critical, such safety valves are frequently assisted by pilot valves which operate to ensure that the main valve opens at the set pressure.The requirement on such pilot valves for accuracy of operation is consequently high, and is difficult to achieve particularly where the set pressure is only slightly above atmospheric pressure, for example from lOm bar to 125m bar above atmospheric pressure. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a pilot valve for assisting operation of a main valve to cause the main valve to open at a set input pressure8 tlie pilot valve being characterised by a diaphragm arranged in use so that one face is permanently subject to input pressure, the diaphragm being connected for movement with a valve member for opening and closing an opening in a valvo seat, the valve member being arranged in use to be subject to a substantially constant pressure on one face, the other face of the valve member defining with the other face of the diaphragm a space which is in communication by restricted passage means with input pressure and is connectable to the main valve1 and the biasing means biasing the valve member to its closed position against input pressure, the valve being arranged such that the valve member will move to its open position at an input pressure which is higher than that at which it will move to its closed position. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a pilot valve for assisting operation of a main valve to cause the main valve to open at a set input pressure, the pilot valve being characterised by a housing provided with a diaphragm defining therewith a first chamber, means for connecting the first chamber to the source of input pressure, so that1 in use, one face of the diaphragm is subject to input pressure, a valve seat and a valve member mounted in the housing1 the valve member being movable with the diaphragm between open and closed positions of the valve member relative to the valve seat, the diaphragm defining with the valve seat and the valve member a second chamber, restricted passage means connected to the second chamber and for connection to input pressure such that, when the valve member is closed, the other face of the diaphragm and one face of the valve member is, in use, subject to input pressure, a third chamber defined by the other face of the valve member, the valve seat and the housing and connectable to a substantially constant pressure, and means for biasing the valve member to its closed position against input pressure, the valve being arranged such that the valve member will move to its open position at an input pressure which is higher than that at which it will move to its closed position. In operation, under normal conditions, both faces of the diaphragm are subject to input pressure and the diaphragm is preferably unstressed, the valve member is subject to the substantially constant pressure and input pressure and biased against the input pressure to its closed position by the biasing means.At the set input pressure determined by the biasing means, the valve member will open to place the second chamber between the valve member and the diaphragm in communication via the valve seat with the substantially constant pressure so that the diaphragm is subject on its one face to input pressure and on its other face to the substantially constant pressure to maintain the valve member in its open position. The input pressure at which the valve will close is determined by the effective area of the diaphragm and the biasing means, and the pilot valve will only close when the input pressure has dropped below the set pressure at which it opens by a predetermined amount. Where the biasing force of the biasing means is constant, the effective area of the diaphragm may be greater than that of the valve member. However the biasing means may include means providing a constant biasing force together with means providing a biasing force which is effective only when the valve member is in its closed position or immediately adjacent thereto.Under such circumstances the effective area of the diaphragm may be only slightly greater than or equal to the effective area of the valve member. In use, the pilot valve is connected to the main valve so that opening and closing of the pilot valve member causes opening and closing of the main valve to relieve the over pressure in tha vessel to which the valves are connected. Preferably the pilot valve comprises a generally cylindrical housing in which the diaphragm extends in a generally diametral plane. The valve seat is defined by an apertured wall also extending in a generally diametral plane and the diaphragm and valve member are connected together by a shaft extending generally axially of the housing and which is guided in the wall. The biasing means may include a spring bearing on the end of the shaft so as to bias the valve member against the wall with a constant biasing force.Alternatively, the biasing means may include, in addition to the spring, magnetic means comprising two parts which are attracted together.when the valve member is in its closed position or close to its closed position. For example, the magnetic biasing means may comprise a magnet mounted in an adjustable position adjacent one end of the shaft and a magnetic member mounted on the other end of the shaft. The housing may conveniently be made in three parts, two end parts and an intermediate part, the intermediate part providing the wall and the periphery of the diaphragm being clamped between the intermediate part and one end part. The invention will be more fully understood from the following description of embodiments thereof, given by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a vertical section through an embodiment of a pilot valve according to the present invention Figure 2 shows n modification of the valve of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a vertical section through another embodiment of a pilot valve according to the present invention and Figure 4 is a diagrammatic view showing the pilot valve of Figure 1 connected to a main valve and to a vessel. As shown in Figure 1, the pilot valve comprises a generally cylindrical housing 1 having a generally axial inlet 2 at one end for connection to, for example, a nozzle on a vessel such as a tank. A diaphragm 3 is mounted in the housing and arranged so that one face 3a together with part of the housing 1 defines a first chamber 4 which is in communication via inlet 2 with input or tank pressure. The other face 3b of the diaphragm 3 faces a wall 5 which is provided with apertures 6 and forms a seat for a valve member 7 which is movable between an open position and a closed position, as shown, opening and closing communication between the chamber 8 defied by the other face 3b of the diaphragm and the opposed face 7b of the valve member, and a chamber 9 defined by face 7a of the valve member and part of the housing 1. The diaphragm 3 and valve member 7 are mounted on and connected together by a shaft 10 which is received and guided by wall 5. The valve member 7 is biased to its closed position by biasing means providing a constant biasing force, e.g., as shown, a spring 11 acting between a member 10a on the end of the shaft 10 and an adjustable member 12 provided at the end of a housing extension 13. Member 12 is arranged at the end of a threaded adjustment member 14 which can be screwed in or out of the housing extension 13 toAdjust the biasing force of the spring 11. Chambers 4 and 8 are permanently in comlnunication via restricted passage means 15 in the shaft 10. Cliaber 8 iB also in communication vie port 16 with the main valve, and chamber 9 is in communication with a substantially constant pressure source, such as the atmosphere, via duct 17. The above described pilot valve operates as follows. Under normal conditions within the tank to which inlet 2 is connected, the valve is closed and the components have the position shown in Figure 1.The diaphragm 3 isunstressed and both its faces 3a, 3b are subject to input pressure, as is the face 7b of the valve member. Face 7a of the valve member is subject to atmospheric pressure. The adjustment member 14 is initially adjusted to set the set pressure relative to atmospheric pressure at which the plot valve will open, the valve member .7 lifting off the valve seat provided by wall 5 at this set pressure.At this point chamber 8 is opened to atmosphere so that the diaphragm 3 is then subject on face 3b to atmospheric pressure and on face 3a to input pressure.The diaphragm 3 will thus assist in maintaining valve member 7 open. In this embodiment the effective area of the diaphragm 3 subject to input pressure is greater than that of the valve member 7, so that the diaphragm 3 will hold the valve member open until the input pressure has dropped by a predetermined amount below the set pressure at which the pilot valve opens1 this amount being determined by the difference in the effective areas of the diaphragm 3 and the valve member 7. As soon as the input pressure has dropped by this predetermined amount, the biasing force of the spring 11 overcomes the force of the diaphragm and closes tile valve member. Input pressure is then reestablished in chamber 8 so that the valve returns to its initial condition. It will be appreciated that the difference in pressures at which the pilot valve opens and closes is determined by the relative dimensions of the diaphragm 3 and the valve member 7, but that the level of the set pressure at which the valve opens can be adjusted by adjustment of the spring, and this is the only adjustment which is required. The pilot valve housing 1 is conveniently made in three parts being two ends parts la, lb and an intermediate part lc. Part lc is integral with the wall 5 and the periphery of the diaphragm is clamped between intermediate part lc and end part la.As shown the three parts are bolted together and can easily be separated for maintenance and checking of the pilot valve. As a fail safe measure, in the event of rupture of the diaphragm 3, the. valve also includes a piston 18 mounted on shaft 10. In normal operation this piston takes no part in operation of the pilot valve, but if the diaphragm 3 ruptures it in effect replaces the diaphragm although, because it has a larger effective area than the diaphragm, the pressure at which the pilot valve will close will be lower than that when the diaphragm is operating. In a modification of the above described pilot valve1 the constant biasing force of the spring 11 is supplemented by biasing means which is effective when the valve member is closed or is immediately adjacent its closed position and which assists the snap action of the pilot valve in opening and provides the valve with 8 snap action in closing. As shown in Figure 2, a permanent magnet 20 is mounted adjacent the lower end of the shaft 10 and the shaft 10 is provided at its lower end with a magnetic body 21 for example, the clamp nut which is threaded ortho the end of shaft 10 to hold the diaphragm 3 and piston 18 on the shaft 10, may be made of magnetic material.In this embodiments the lower eud of the shaft 10 is provided with grooves connected with passage 15 and is at all times spaced from the magnet 20. The magnet 20 is held on its mounting means 23 by a stud 22. In operation, the valve member will move to its open position when the resultant force of the differential pressure across the valve member equals the biasing force of the spring and of the magnet, and, once the valve member starts to move to its open position it will snap into its open position. As the valve member moves to its closed position it will snap shut as soon as the member 21 comes within the range of the magnet 20.This magnetic biasing means provides the pilot valve with a very positive opening and closing action which is particularly useful at relatively iow operating pressures. Figure 3 shows another embodiment of a pilot valve according to the present invention which is, in many respects, similar to that of Figure 1. Like parts have been given the same reference numerals as are used in Figure 1 and description of this embodiment will be limited to the features by which it differs from the embodiment of Figure 1. While not apparent from Figure 3, chamber 9 is in communication with the atmosphere by a passage similar to passage 17 through parts lb and Ic of the housing 1, chamber 8 is in communication with the main valve through a passage similar to passage i6, and passages similar to passage 6 are provided in the wall 5. In this embodiment, the pilot valve is connected laterally to the vessel by a lateral passage 2 in part la and the restricted connection between chambers 4 and 8 is provided by a passage 15 in parts la, lc which opens laterally into chamber 4 and in the wall 5 beneath the valve member 7. As shown, this pilot valve includes the modification of Figure 2 and is provided with a magnet 20 mounted on mounting means 23 in an axial opening in part la of the housing. Mounting means 23 is adJustably positionable in the opening.A magnetic member 21 is provided at the end of shaft 10 facing the magnet 20 and serves, together with threaded member 10a, to hold the piston 18 and diaphragm 3 on the shaft 10. Where the biasing means biasing the valve member to its closed position includes means providing a biasing force which is effective only when the valve member is in or immediately adjacent its closed position, it will be appreciated that the effective area of the diaphragm may be the sale or only slightly greater than that of the valve member and the pilot valve will still operate to close when the input pressure has dropped by a predetermined amount below the set opening pressure. In this case the input pressure at which the valve will close is determined not only by the difference, if any, between the effective areas of the diaphragm and valve member1 but also by the magnetic biasing force, and can be adjusted by adjusting the position of the magnet. The above described pilot valves are useful with any suitable main valve of the bellows or diaphragm type and, by way of example, Figure 4 shows diagrammatically the connection of the pilot valve ofFigure 1 with a diaphragm type main pressure relief valve 119, the two valves being mounted on the wall of a tank o reservoir 120. It will be appreciated that the connectioii of a pilot valve according toFigure 3 to a main valve will be exactly the same, the difference being that the pilot valve will be corrected laterally to the tank rather than axially. As shown in Figure 4, chamber 8 of the pilot valve is connected by pipework 121 to a space 122 above a diaphragm 123 which, as shown, closes a valve seat 124. During normal operating conditions, the pressure within chamber 122 is tank pressure but, since the diaphragm 123 has a greater effective area than the area of the seat 124, the diaphragm 123 is held in a closed position against the seat. As soon as the pilot valve opens, chamber 122 is connected via the pilot valve to the atmosphere 80 that the pressure falls and the diaphragm 123 will lift off the seat 124 to open the tank to atmosphere. When the pilot valve closes, pressure is again established in chamber 122 and the main valve closes. It will be appreciated that the pilot valve described above can be made of any material suitable for the particular operating conditions. For example, for use with vessels containing ammonia or low temperature liquids, the valve housing may be made of stainless steel and the diaphragm of PTFE with or without glass reinforcement. For less stringent operating conditions, the valve housing could be made of aluminium or cast iron and the diaphragm of a rubber elastomer. It will be appreciated that the relative dimensions of the pilot valve diaphragm 3 and valve member 7 can be varied depending on the requirements for the pilot valve. As this pressure at which the pilot valve is to open increases above atmospheric pressure, the areas of the diaphragm and valve member are of course reduced. There are thus described pilot valves which are of simple and therefore cheap construction, which are easy to operate and maintain and are very simple to adjust to set the predetermined pressure levels.
