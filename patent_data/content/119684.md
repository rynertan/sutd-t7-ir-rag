# Soft edge seat belt webbing.

## Abstract
A woven webbing 10 for seat belts has a plurality of longitudinally extending yarn strands 12 interwoven with transverse extending yarn strands 14 . One or more of the longitudinally extending yarn strands immediately adjacent an edge of the webbing 10 is formed from a flocked yarn 16 . The flocked yarn 16 is comprised of a carrier yarn 18 having a multitude of flock fibres 20 adhesively secured thereto and oriented perpendicular to the carrier yarn 18 . The length of the flock fibres is sufficient to ensure that the fibres 20 extend beyond the longitudinal and transverse extended yarn strands 12, 14 so that the flock fibres 20 ef fectively soften the edge of the webbing 10 for occupant comfort.
