# Process for the manufacture of objects from an unsaturated polyester composition.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the manufacture of objects having a thickness of at least 2 mm from an unsaturated polyester composition, in which the emission of ethylenically unsaturated monomer during the processing of the polyester composition is limited by exposing the latter to UV radiation with a low pressure UV lamp, after which the composition is cured under the influence of a radical initiator at a temperature lower than 70 C.
