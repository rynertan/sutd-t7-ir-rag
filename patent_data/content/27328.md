# Weatherstrip.

## Abstract
Weatherstripping for minimising or eliminating draughts around doors, windows and the like comprising a flexible backing strip 1 having sealing material projecting from at least one of its surfaces, preferably of pile material 3 , and wherein at least one barrier fin 5 is located within the sealing material and extends generally at right angles away from the face of the backing strip 1 to which the sealing material is attached, the fin incorporating therein a plurality of fold lines 7 extending substantially parallel to each other about which the fin is folded so as to define a generally zig zag fin arrangement. The zig zags may extend the full height of the fin or may be provided just at the upper end of the fin and in a particular construction, the free end portion of the fin is turned over so as partially to overlie some of the sealing material in use.
