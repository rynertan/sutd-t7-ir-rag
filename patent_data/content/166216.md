# Method of forming a nitride layer.

## Abstract
A method of forming a layer of a nitride or carbonitride of titanium, vanadium or the like on the surface of an article to be treated includes disposing a treating material com posed of refractory powder, powder of a metal or alloy of a nitride forming element and a halide powder, and the article to be treated in a fluidized bed furnace and introducing a nitrogen containing gas into the furnace under a heated condition to fluidize the treating material, thereby effecting the surface treatment. This method provides a nitride or carbonitride layer having a smooth surface and a uniform thickness rapidly and safely without using hydrogen and a halogen vapor.
