# Automatic pipettor.

## Abstract
The pipettor automatically and rapidly transfers accurate and precise multiple quantities of samples, e.g. blood serum, and reagent to the rotatable transfer disc 12 of a centrifugal analyzer. The removable transfer disc 12 comprises a multiplicity of elongated radial cavities 12a into which the sample and reagent are automatically and individually dispensed. The pipettor is very flexible in operation and is capable of performing a number of pipetting procedures.
