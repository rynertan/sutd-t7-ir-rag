# Resilient internal mandrel.

## Abstract
An internal mandrel 10 is disclosed which is used for supporting the inner wall 30 of a pipe 12 during bending. The internal mandrel includes a urethane plug 31 which is compressed between the piston 60 of a hydraulic cylinder 56 and an end plate 36 . This expands the urethane ra dially outward into contact with the inner wall 30 of the pipe to support the pipe during bending. Resilient steel strips 88 can be mounted on the exterior surface of the urethane plug 31 at the inside bend of the pipe to increase the effective wall thickness of the pipe at the inner bend to reduce the likelihood of deformation during bending. In a second embodiment, internal mandrel 200 includes an an nular urethane plug 204 positioned between a resilient cy linder 202 and the inner wall of the pipe 12 .
