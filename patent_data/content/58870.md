# Process for preparing 4 hydroxy 5 methyl 2,3 dihydrofuranone 3 and changing organoleptic properties of foods.

## Abstract
4 Hydroxy 5 methyl 2,3 dihydrofuranone 3 is obtained by heating a solution with pH between 1 and 7 of a 5 ketoaldohexonic acid or a derivative thereof in a polar solvent at a temperature of 70 C to 150 C. The 5 keto aldohexonic acid is preferably 5 ketogluconic acid. Meat flavours are obtained by heating the 5 keto aldohexonic acid unter the same conditions in the presence of a hydrogen sulphide donor like e.g. cysteine. This reaction product may be incorporated into foodstuffs. Also a process of modifying the organoleptic properties of a foodstuff or an ingredient for a foodstuff having a pH between 5 and 7 before consumption and which has to be heated at least 15 minutes to at least 70 C by incorporating from 30 to 2000 ppm of a 5 keto aldohexonic acid is described.
