## Description
Title Apparatus for mounting a worktiece The present invention relates to an apparatus for mounting a workpiece in a machine tool such as a grinding or milling machine. In, for example the grinding of a slot in a workpiece the latter is first secured to a work holding table of a grinding machine and then the grinding operation is commenced. The slot ray be ground by a single slow traverse of the ork holding table past a rotating grinding wheel with the latter positioned so that the full depth of the slot is ground in a single pass of the workniece. h tWrpical traverse speed for the table would normally lie in the range 25 mm minute to 300 mm minute.This method of grinding is knovn as creep feed grinding.another method of grinding, known as pendulum grinding may also be used. Here the table is reciprocated at a higher speed with the grinding wheel being lowered a small amount at the end of each traverse of the table to grind ay a stall portion of the slot until the re uired slot depth is achieved. In this case the traversing velocity of the table is t 5clly 30, OO mm minute. disadvantage f pendulum grinding lies esin its applicability tc t r grinding of slots along workpieces of short lengths. The high traversing speeds of the ork holding table combined with the high inertial forces involved in first decelerating and then accelerating the table at the end of each stroke result in a stroke which at its minimlm can be considerably longer than the workpiece being ground.It is frequently not possible at a traversing speed of 30,000 minute in the mode knoam as pendulum grinding, to provide a shorter stroke than approximately 75 mm, and if for example the workpiece length, into which the slot is being ground, is of the order of 5 mm then clearly the majority of the traversing length is not employed in metal cutting. The present invention seeks to reduce the overrun of the grinding wheel and therefore reduce the time of the grinding operatinn. Accordingly the resent invention provides an apparatus for mountinr a workpiece in a machine tool, the apparatus comprising a base for securing to a work holding table of the machine a platform for supporting the workpiece, the platform being slidable relative to said base and drive means for reciprocably driving solid platform. Preferably the drive means is a drive motor and the apparatus further comprises coupling means for eccentrically coupling said platform to a drive shaft of said drive motor and wherein the angle between the rotational axis of said drive shaft and the reciprocal path of said platform is a preset angle. In one embodiment of the present invention the platform includes a piston cylinder arrangement for reciprocally driving said platform and said drive means comprises control means for controlling the flow of pressurised fluid to said piston cylinder arrangement. The control means includes valve means for controlling the flow of fluid to respective fluid chambers of said pistoncylinder arrangement and trip means operable at the end of each stroke of the platform to trip said valve means for reversing the fluid flow to said piston cylinder arrangement so as to reverse the direction of movement of said platform. The pressiirised fluid may be a liquid or a gas such as air. Because of the relative light weight of a platform of an apparatus according to the present invention the platform may be reciprocated at high speeds with a precise and adjustable short stroke. The present invention is further described hereinafter, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a plan view, partially in section, of a first embodiment of an apparatus according to the present invention Figure 2 is a side elevation, partially in section, of the apparatus of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a section on line A A of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a section on line 3 3 of Figure 1 Figure 5 is a plan view of a portion of the apparatus of Figure 1 showing the drive motor inclined at an angle of 1350 to the reciprocating axis Figure 6 is a view similar to Figure 5 showing the drive motor at an angle of 900 to the reciprocating axis Figure 7 is a view similar to Figure 1 of a second embodiment of an apparatus according to the present invention Figure 8 is a side elevation, partially in section, of the apparatus of Figure 7 Figure 9 is a section on line C C of Figure 7 and Figure 10 is a section on line D D of Figure 7. Referring to Figures 1 to 6 the illustrated apparatus 10 comprises an elongate platform 12 for supporting a workpiece to be machined, the platform being slidably mounted by way of two hard steel guide bars 14 of circular cross section which are secured to the platform 12 longitudinally thereof by means of two end plates 22, 24, one guide bar 14 on each side of the central axis of the platform 12. Each guide bar,14 is mounted for reciprocal movement in two coaxial closed shell ball bushings 16 which are secured in a respective housing 18 in turn securely mounted on a base plate 20. h X slot 22 is provided in the upper surface of the platform 12 to receive a workpiece holding device. The platform 12 is coupled to a drive motor 36 which reciprocates the former during a machining operation as is described in greater detail below. To avoid undue stresses and vibrations being set up during reciprocation of the platform 12 a counterbalance 26 is provided and is located beneath the platform and between the guide bars 14. The counterbalance comprises a trolley 28 mounted on wheels 30 which are guided in parallel track grooves 32 in the surface of the baseplate 20.The trolley is coupled to the end plate 24 via an arm 34 which is pivoted to the trolley and the enci plate about parallel horizontal axes perpendlcu3ar to the direction of reciprocation of the platform 12 sch that during reciprocation of the platform 12 the trolley 28 moves in an opposite direction and with an enual velocity to that of the platform and associated orkpiece. The trolley, is detachable from the apparatus and can be loaded with various values of dead weights 24, shown in dotted form in Figure 2, enabling an accurate match of mass and balance to be achieved between the counter balance 26 and the platform 12 and its associated load. High speed simple harmonic motion is applied to the platform 12 by menns of the motor 36, which may be an air, electric or hydraulic motor. The drive shaft 38 of the motor mounts a drive plate 40 which is coupled to the end plate 24 by means of a flexible joint 42. The joint comprises a s ivel shaft 44 which is rotatably and eccentrically mounted in the drive plate 40 with the rotational axis of the shaft 44 parallel to the rotational axis of the plate 40 and drive shaft 38. The swivel shaft 44 is coupled by way of two universal coupling 46, 48 and an intermediate lin1 50 to a bearing shaft 52 which is rotatably mounted in the end plate 24.The rotational axis of the shrft 52 is preferably aligned truth the rotational axis of the motor drive shaft 38 in the position of the motor as shown in Figures 1 and 2 nithot2Ã§h this. is not essential to t e operation of the apparatus. In the in line condition of the motor, as shown inFigures 1 and 2 rotation of the motor drive shaft 38 merely rotates the shaft 52 with no reciprocating simple harmonic motion of the platform 12. The motor 36, is spigotally secured in a bracket 54, which is in turn pivotally mounted on the baseplate 20 by means of a pivot pin 56, precisely and accurately located beneath the centre line of the universal coupling 48 This allows the angle that the motor drive shaft axis makes with the axis of the shaft 52 to be varied through 90 between an aligned attitude and one where the axes are at right angles to one another, by pivoting the motor 36 about the pivot pin 56. With the motor 36 in the position shown in Figures 1 and 2 the plane of the circle prescribed by the shaft 44 is perpendicular to the axis of the shaft 52 mnd there is therefore no reciprocation of the latter and thus of the platform 12.With the motor pivoted through 900 the axis of the shaft 52 lies in the plane of the circle and the extent of the reciprocation applied to the platform 12 is determined by the eccentricity of the shaft 44. With a preferable eccentricity of 25 mm the maxim m reciprocating stroke is 50 mm, with the flexible joint 42 acting merely as a crank. As will be appreciated the stroke of the platform 12 is infinitely variable between its ii.maximum of 50 mm and zero motion, by discretely adjusting the angular position of the air motor about its pivot pin 56. For example, the situation obtaining then the motor is at an angular position of 450, relative to the longitudinal axis of the work support table, is shown in Figure 5, in which case the universal jointed transmission lines no longer act as a simple crass, but acts so to accomodate the variable and angular velocities imparted in this condition. A further embodiment of apparatus according to the resent invention is shown in Figures 7 to 10. Farts similar to those in Figures 1 to 6 are given like reference numbers. In this embodiment the platform 12 and its mountings are similar to those of the apparatus shown in Figures 1 to 6. The reciprocation, however, of the nlatform 12 is achieved diferently. The guide bar 14 is hollow, with its bore honed to a fine finish, and serves with a respective piston 60 as a double acting piston cylinder unit. Each piston is secured by a dowel 62 to the housing 18.Each dowel is drilled and cross connected to drillings in the associated piston 60 and forms a pes,s , eway for pressurised fluid, in thins case air, to enter and exhaust fror a respective one Or the two pressure Th t .m 6 , 66 formed by each piston 60 and the culinder 14 . e than chprfbers 64 and 70 are inter connected by passage ays 71 as are the two chambers 66 and 68 so that when pressurised fluid is applied to, for example chamber 64, fluid is also forced into chamber 70 to drive the platform in a first direction, fluid being exhausted from chambers 66 and 68. reversing the flow of fluid reverses the movement of the platform 12. The alternating supply of pressurised fluid to the chambers 64,70 and 6i68 is controlled by an assembly comprising a trip bar 72 which is secured to the right hand end plate 24 and equipped with left and right hand clans 74, 76 which are adjustable along the length of trip bar 72 by means of nuts 78. The whole of this assembly reciprocates with the platform 12. Two cams 80, 82 mounted one above the other are rigidly secured to one another and are freely rotatably mounted on a pivot 84 by way of a hush 86. h pin 88 is secured to the upper face of the upper cam 80 and is arranged to be contacted by the opposing faces of the right and left hand clamps 74, 76 during movement of the platform 12 so that the cams 80, 82 are partially rotated by the movement of the trit bar 72. The linear movement of the trip bar 72 is thus converted into rotary movement of the cans P0 82. The flow of pressurised fluid from a common source not shown to the respective pistons 60 is controlled by two fluid control valves 90, 92 which are secured to the baseplate 2C in such a manner that their operating levers 94, 96 make contact respectively with the upper and lower cam profiled on the cams 80, 82. The cam profiles are arranged such that rotation of the cams to one extreme angular position as a result of movement of the platform 12 in a first direction trips the two control valves 90, 92 reversing the direction of fluid flow to reverse the movement of the platform 12.This reversal of movement also reverses rotation of the cans until the cam profile again trip the valves, thus once more reversing the fluid flow and resulting in a reciprocating movement of the platform 12. The stroke of the platform 12 is adjusted by adjusting the position of the clamps 74 end 76 along the tripbar 72. In use on apparatus according to the present invention is secured on a work holding table of a machine tool such as a grinding machine. The table remains stationary and tbe platform of the apparatus riay apply typically 1,000 strokes minute, irrespective of the stroke length t a max Jur traverse speed of 36, mm minute. Because . t cr r the stroke is relatively short the h grinding wheel nay be fed towards the workpiece at a continuous speed rather than in increments. With regard to Figure 7. although two piston cylinder units are described it will be appreciated that the apparatus will operate with only one piston cylinder unit preferably located centrally of the platform.
