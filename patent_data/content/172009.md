# SULFUR OXIDE AND PARTICULATE REMOVAL PROCESS AND SYSTEM

## Abstract
A process and system is provided in which particulates and sulfur oxides are simultaneously removed from flue gases in a granular bed filter and scrubber with special sulfur oxide capturing and particulate removing material. The spent sulfur oxide capturing and particulate removing mate rial can be regenerated in a lift pipe riser.
