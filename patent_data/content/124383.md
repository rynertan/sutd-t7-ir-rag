# Monitoring physical properties of a fluid.

## Abstract
An impeller 4 on a stirrer shaft 3 is rotated at constant an gular velocity by a motor 12 within a chamber 1 and 2. Vibra tions induced in the shaft 3 by virtue of the stirring action of the impeller 4 are sensed by a transducer 5 whose output is condi tioned by equipment 6 to provide signals representing vibration of the shaft 3. Analysing equipment 7 infers conditions within the chamber 1 and 2 from these signals. The invention can be applied to processes in a reaction vessel and liquid in a pump chamber. Since the excitation is a constant angular velocity and the induced effect is vibration, there is no interference be tween excitation and induced effect although the transducer 5 is mounted on the stirrer shaft.
