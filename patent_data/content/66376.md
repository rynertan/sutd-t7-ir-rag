# Data processing system.

## Abstract
In a data processing system having an instruction buffer 23 , inconsistency between a memory MS4 and the instruction buffer occurs by a store operation to the memory if an instruction in the store area has been prefetched to the instruction buffer. The changing on the memory of the content prefetched to the instruction buffer, and the proceed ing of the execution of the instruction to the changed instruction are detected based on an instruction fetch address of an instruction to be fetched from the memory to the instruction buffer, an execution instruction address of an instruction to be executed, information on a byte position at which the instruction to be executed is stored, a store address by a store instruction and information on a byte position which is changed by a store operation when the execution of the instruction proceeds to the changed instruc tion, the content of the instruction buffer is invalidated.
