## Description
SPECIFICATION Use of A Phospholipid Derivative This invention relates to use of a phospholipid derivative. More particularly, this invention relates to use of a compound of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R1 is a C14 19 alkyl group R2, R3 and R4 are independently C12 alkyl orEMI1.2 represents a nitrogencontaining five or six membered heterocyclic ring andEMI1.3 is a nitrogen containing four to six membered heterocyclic group, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting the proliferation of tumors in a warm blooded animal or prolonging the life span of said animal. The compounds represented by the formula I , from the standpoint of their chemical structures, are analogs of the platelet activating factor PAF . PAF is a mediator released from basophils in the antigenantibody reactions between an antigen and IgE antibody, and has been identified structurally by Hanahan et al. J.Biol. Chem., 254, 9355 1979 as a glycerophospholipid having an octadecyl or hexadecyl group through the ether linkage at the l position of glycerol and an acetyl group at the 2 position i.e. l O octadecyl 2 0 acetyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine. The factor as chemically synthesized , when injected in an extremely small amount into animals, not only causes activation of platelets and neutrophils but also exhibits, for example, vesselpermeability increasing, smooth muscle constricting and blood pressure lowering actions. The said compounds, normally, through intravenous injection in not less than 1.5 pg head, can bring about typical anaphylactic shock in rabbits, and thus acute toxic death of rabbits can be observed. As mentioned above, PAF shows extremely strong toxicity, and therefore, it is considered unsuitable to use it itself as a drug. In addition, PAF has been known to be readily susceptible to hydrolysis and inactivation by acetyl hydrolase existing in living organisms,and it is also generally noticed that PAF lacks the long duration of action as a drug. In the Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.2636 1980, also, there have been disclosed compounds possessing anticancer activity, whereby almost all of the compounds disclosed in the said gazette, nevertheless, have an acyl group as R1. The compounds having an acyl group as R1 in vivo, undergo readily enzymatic hydrolysis and inactivation, and exhibit anticancer activity being markedly inferior in potency and duration to the corresponding compounds having alkyl as R1. Although only one compound No. 3 having alkyl as R1 has been disclosed in the said gazzette, the said compound has carbamoyl at the 2 position of the glycerol skeleton.The compounds having a carbamoyl group at the 2 position of the glycerol skeleton, like PAF, are found to exhibit severe side effects, such as platelet activating, neutrophilactivating, tissue impairing, vessel permeability increasing and blood pressure lowering actions, and such side effects place restrictions on their utilization as a pharmaseutical. Because PAF and the compounds as specifically described in the Japanese Unexamined Patent PublicationNo. 2636 1980 all, in vivo, undergo readily enzymatic hydrolysis and inactivation or exhibit potent toxicity by themselves, there have been encountered difficulties in employing them as an antitumor agent. The present inventors, with a specific view to the search for an antitumor agent which is resistant to enzymes existing in vivo and also exhibits extremely low toxicity, conducted intensive research, and as a result, succeeded in preparing the antitumor agents which possess potent anti tumor activities inclusive of macrophage activating and tumor necrotizing actions while exhibiting outstandingly reduced side effects such as platelet activating and blood pressure lowering actions, which has led to the completion of the present invention. With reference to the above formula I , the C1419 alkyl group represented by R1 includes straight chain alkyl groups such as tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl.and nonadecyl, and branched chain alkyl groups such as 3,7,11 trimethyldodecyl, whereby straight chain alkyl groups having 16 to 18 carbon atoms among others, are preferred. The C12 alkyl group represented by R2, R3 and R4 includes alkyl groups such as methyl and ethyl. The nitrogen containing five membered heterocyclic group represented by the groupEMI4.1 includes groups such as thiazolio, oxazolio and N methylpyrrolidinio, while the nitrogen containing six membered heterocyclic group includes groups, such as pyridinio, N methylpiperazinio,N methylmorpholinio and N methylpiperidinio. The nitrogen containing four to six membered heterocyclic group represented by the groupEMI4.2 includes groups, such as azetidino, pyrrolidino, piperidino, morpholino, piperazino and thiomorpholino. Incidentally, the compound I in some instances exists in the form of salts, such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts represented by the formulae EMI4.3 wherein A is an anion, such as chlorine, bromine, iodine and tosyl ions the others are as defined hereinbefore andEMI5.1 wherein M is an alkali metal e.g., Na, K ion or alkaline earth metal e.g., Ca, Mg ion . The conversion of I into Ia or Ib and the conversion of Ia or Ib into I can be readily carried out by the per se known methods. The compounds which are used as the antitumor agent according to the present invention are specifically disclosed by the following compounds l O Octadecyl 2 O pyrrolidinocarbonyl glycero 3phosphocholine, l O octadecyl 2 O morpholinocarbonyl glycero 3 phosphocholine, l O octadecyl 2 O piperidino carbonyl glycero 3 phosphocholine, l O octadecyl 2 O azetidinocarbonyl glycero 3 phosphocholine, 3 octadecyloxy2 morpholinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 N methylmorpholinio ethyl phosphate, 3 octadecyloxy 2 pyrrolidinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 N methylpyrrolidinio ethyl phosphate, 3 octa decyloxy 2 azetidinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 N methylpyrrolidinio ethyl phosphate, 3 octadecyloxy 2 morpholinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 pyridinioethyl phosphate, 3 octadecyloxy 2 morpholinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 thiazolioethyl phosphate, 3 octadecyloxy 2 pyrrolidinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 thiazolioethyl phosphate, 3 hexadecyloxy 2 morpholinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 thiazolioethyl phosphate, 3 hexadecyloxy 2 rnorpholinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 pyridinioethyl phosphate, 3 octadecyloxy 2 pyrrolidinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 pyridinioethyl phosphate and 3 octadecyloxy 2 piperidinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 pyridinioethyl phosphate. The compounds I and their salts can be readily produced by the method as described in the Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 192825 1983 or those analogous thereto. With regard to the compound I , there exists two kinds of the stereoisomers of R and S configurations, and their individual stereo isomers or a mixture thereof may be used. The anti tumor agent according to the present invention possesses excellent antitumor activities, with extremely reduced side effects, and can be administered per se or as a suitable pharmaceutical composition as a safe antitumor agent, to cancer bearing warm blooded animals. The compound I is.well absorbed even on oral administration, und can be safely administered parenterally or orally. While the dosage level varies depending upon the conditions of the disease to be treated as well as the route of administration, in the case of administration to cancer .bearing warm blooded animals as an antitumor agent, the compound as an injectable solution is normally administered at a single dose of preferably about 0.03 to 50 mg kg as the compound I , preferably once to twice per day according to the conditions. When the compound is administered through other parenteral routes of administration and orally, the dosage levels are suitably determined in accordance with the case of an injectable solution. The pharmaceutical composition which is to be used as an antitumor agent contains an effective amount of the compound I or. its salt, as an active ingredient, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such a composition is provided as a dosage form suitable for oral or parenteral administration. Thus, the composition for oral administration, for example, maybe in solid or liquid dosage forms which are specifically exemplified by tablets inclusive of sugar coated tablets and film coated tablets , pills, granules, powders, capsules inclusive of soft capsules syrups, emulsions, suspensions, etc. Such compositions are manufactured by the per se known processes, and contain a carrier or excipient conventionally used in the art.For example, the carrier and excipient for tablets include lactose, starch, sucrose, magnesium stearate, etc. The composition for parenteral administration for example, may be in dosage forms, such as injectable solutions and suppositories, wherein the injectable solutions include such injectable solutions for intravenous and intramuscular administration. Such injectable solutions are prepared by the per se known processes, namely by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying the compound I in a sterile aqueous or oily solution. The aqueous solution for injections includes, for example, physiological saline and isotonic solutions, which, if necessary, may be used in combination with a suitable solubilizer, such as alcohols e.g., ethanol , polyalcohols e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol , non ionic surface active agents e.g., Polysorbate 80, HCO 50 polyoxyethylene 50 mol adduct of hydrogenated castor oil and the like.The oily solution includes, for example, sesame oil and soybean oil, which may be employed in combination with a solubilizer, such as benzyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol. The injectable solutions thus prepared are normally filled into appropriate ampoules.The suppositories used for rectal administration are prepared by incorporating the compound I into conventional bases for suppositories. The above mentioned oral or parenteral pharmaceutical compositions are conveniently prepared in the unit dosage forms being adapted to correspond to the dose of the active ingredient. As such a unit dosage form, there may be illustrated tablets, pills, capsules, injectable solutions ampoule , suppositories, etc., and each of the respective unit dosage forms comprises normally 1 to 50 mg of the compound among others, the injectable solution preferable contains 1 to 10 mj of the around I , while the other dosage forms preferably contain 1 to 25 mg of the coopd In order to secure by far enhancement of the antitumor activities of the compound I and further reduction of its side effects, the compound I may be used as a lipid globule e.g., emulsion, liposome by adding natural phospholipids, such as yolk lecithin, soybean lecithin, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserin, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine, or synthetic phospholipids, such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Each of the above mentioned compositions may contain other active ingredients, unless their formulation with the compound I produces undesirable interactions.

The compound I represented by the formula I , because of its potent antitumor activity and mild toxicity, can be used as an antitumor agent serving the useful purpose of producing the preventive, therapeutic and Tife span prolonging effects against tumors, such as leukemia and solid cancer. For example, the compound exhibits excellent efficacy toward mice bearing the solid and ascitesSarcoma 180 S 180 and Meth A tumors when administered intravenously, into the tumor tissues or intraperitoneally. Also, the compound produces inhibitory effect in the in vitro proliferation inhibition test using myelogenous leukemia cells of a man HL 60 , while demonstrating marked immunologic enhancement action, particularly outstanding macrophage activating acitity. In addition, when the compound being usable in the present invention is administered intravenously or intraperitoneally to mice bearing the solid tumor such as the Meth A and S 180 tumors, necrosis through bleeding of the tumor tissue can be observed.Consequently, the anti tumor effect of the compound being usable in the present invention is considered to be based on the complex effect having in combination the immunologic enhancement and direct cytocidal actions. The test examples are described in the following to illustrate the effect of the present invention specifically. Test Example 1 ICR mice a group consisting of five mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 x 105 S 180 cells per mouse, and then given 0.3 mg mouse of l O octadecyl 2 O morpholinocarbonyl glycero 3 phosphocholine CompoundNo. 1 dissolved in physiological saline once a day, three times in total, on the day of the inoculation and on the next day and the second day after the inoculation. The average of the survival days for the control group consisting of 5 mice was 12.2 days, whereas the number of surviving mice in the drug treated group on the 50th day and the life span prolongation ratio T C against the control group, are shown in Table 1. In a similar manner, a test was carried out with l O octadecyl 2 O methylglycero 3 phosphocholine used as a control drug A , with the results being shown below Table 1 Antitumor effect against mice bearing S 180 tumor.Test Number of mice T C compound surviving for 50 days Compound 1 2 336 Control drug A 0 162 Test Example 2Activity toward mice bearing the Sarcoma 180 tumor. ICR mice male, 8 week old, a group consisting of 5 mice , as divided into two groups, were transplanted subcutaneously with 1 x 106 S 180 cells per mouse, respectively.One group was treated with the drug by injection into the tumor every four days commencing with the 7th day after the transplantation, four times in total. On the 24th day, the average tumor weight for the drug treated group was measured, and the ratio the tumor proliferation inhibition ratio against that for the control group not treated with the drug was calculated. The results are shown in Table 2.Table 2 Dose Weight of Proliferation Drug mg kg tumor g inhibition ratio Not treated 1 1.49 control group 2 25 0.71 52.4 3 25 0.39 73.9Note Drug 2 1 O Octadecyl 2 O piperidinocarbonyl glycero 3 phosphocholine Drug 3 3 Octadecyloxy 2 morpholinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 thiazolioethyl phosphate Test Example 3Necrotic effect against the Meth A tumor tissue Balb c mice were transplated subcutaneously with 4 x 106 Meth A cells, and 7.days.later, treated with an aqueous solution of the drug a solution in physiological saline by intravenous injection, whereupon the tumor tissue was observed for any change.In the case where l O octadecyl 2 O pyrrolidinocarbonyl glycero 3 phospho choline 25 mg kg, given intravenously and l 0 octadecyl2 O morpholinocarbonyl glycero 3 phosphocholine 1.25 mg kg, given intravenously were employed as a drug, the tumor tissue, initially appearing pink, turned red black after 24 hours, and there was observed necrosis through bleeding. A similar test was carried out with ICR mice bearing the S 180 tumor, whereby similar changes of the tumor tissue were observed. Test Example 4 According to the method of R. Gallo et al. described in Blood 54 3 , 713 1979 , the growth inhibiting effect IG effect and differentiation inducing activity of 1 0 octadecyl 2 O morpholinocarbonyl glycero 3 phosphocholine against human myelocytic leukemia cells HL 60 were assayed. The results were that the IG effect on HL 60 GDso was 0.6 pg ml and that the compound had miXd differentiation inducing activity at a concentration of 1 2 ug ml. Test Example 5 Neither l O octadecyl 2 O morpholinocarbonyl glycero 3 phosphocholine nor 3 octadecyloxy 2 morpholinocarbonyloxy propyl 2 thiazolioethyl phosphate at a concentration of 3 x 10 5 M caused platelet aggregation against rat platelet.
