# Improvements relating to video editing systems.

## Abstract
A system for combining two or more video signal inputs using a chroma key like system. The keying is not done to one colours, like saturated blue, but to any colour within a range. One of the video signal inputs 1 is frozen and appears as a still picture on a display 6. Graphic means 16 are used to define an area of the picture and the maximum and minimum values of the colour components of the signals in that area are detected. Whenever a signal with components falling within the detected range is present in a switch 14 it operates to select a channel for output. this works to build up a composite picture.
