## Description
PROCESS FOR DETERMINING SUBSTRATE OR ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY This invention relates to a process for quantitatively determining a substrate or enzymatic activity in a body fluid. More particularly, this invention relates to a process for quantitatively determining a substrate or enzymatic activity after removing influences of a substance which is present in a body fluid and gives an error to the determination. Recently, in the field of clinical examinations, there have widely been employed processes for measuring hydrogen peroxide produced by treating a substrate or a substance produced by an enzymatic reaction of a substrate with an oxidase as a process for measuring a component in a body fluid. As a process for measuring hydrogen peroxide, there has mainly been employed a process comprising adding to a sample 4 aminoantipyrine and a phenol derivative, a naphthol derivative or an aniline derivative in the presence of peroxidase to produced a colored substance by oxidative condensation, followed by colorimetrical determination. But with an increase of a demand for more precise determination, there has become a problem the presence of a substance in a body fluid, said substance giving an error to the determination.For example, there were found the following substances for giving errors to the determination, that is, free glycerol in a body fluid in the determination of triglyceride, cholesterol in the determination of cholesterol ester, sarcosine in the determination of creatine or creatinine, pyruvic acid in the enzymatic activity determination of glutamate pyruvate transaminase hereinafter referred to as GPT or glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase hereinafter referred to as GOT , and glucose in the enzymatic activity determination of amylase. Various methods for decomposing or removing such substances as giving errors to the determination have been studied. For example, European Patent Publication No. 0054358 discloses a process for decomposing hydrogen peroxide by reacting hydrogen peroxide produced by oxidation of a free compound which gives an error to the determination with a phenol or aniline derivative in the presence of peroxidase to form non coloring compound.Said European Patent Publication further provides a process for quantitative determination of a non oxidizable analyte in a sample containing both said analyte and an enzymatically oxidizable derivative thereof, which comprises enzymatically oxidizing said derivative with an oxidase, decomposing hydrogen peroxide produced in the sample by said oxidase by a reaction with a phenol or aniline derivative in the presence of a peroxidase, converting the non oxidizable analyte into a further quantity of said oxidizable derivative, and quantitatively determining said further quantity of said oxidizable derivative.In Chemical Abstracts 98 30600 m 1983 , there is disclosed a process for determining a substrate or its enzymatic activity by the determination of H202 formed by reacting an oxidase with a product formed by the enzymatic reaction, characterized in that a sample is added to a first reagent containing an oxidase, peroxidase and a phenol, aniline or naphthol derivative, and the resulting mixture is mixed with a second reagent containing a coupler such as 4 aminoanitipyrine, followed by colorimetrical determination.According to these processes, a phenol or aniline derivative or a naphthol derivative is used for decomposing a substance which gives errors to the determination, but since the phenol, aniline or naphthol derivative is also used for producing a color with a coupler such as 4 aminoantipyrine, a partial consumption of the phenol, aniline or naphthol derivative for decomposing hydrogen peroxide makes it difficult to form uniform color producing conditions in the color developing reaction. On the other hand, if a large amount of the phenol, aniline or naphthol derivative is used for compensating the consumed amount for decomposing hydrogen peroxide which gives an error to the determination, the reagent blank value is undesirably raised, which results in making the determination with high accuracy impossible. It is an object of this invention to provide a process for quantitatively determining a substrate or enzymatic activity in a body fluid with high accuracy by overcoming disadvantages of the prior art processes. This invention procides a process for quantitatively determining a substrate or enzymatic activity in a body fluid which comprises adding to a sample to be measured a first reagent solution comprising 2 naphthol or a derivative thereof represented by the formula EMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group or a sulfonic acid group, peroxidase, an oxidase, and if necessary one or more substances used for producing a substrate or used as substrates for oxidase or used for an enzymatic reaction of a substrate with the oxidase, so as to remove an influence of substance in the sample giving an error to the determination an interfering substance , adding to the resulting mixture a second reagent solution comprising a coupler such as 4 aminoantipyrine, a developer selected from phenol derivatives, l naphthol derivatives and aniline derivatives, and an enzyme necessary for producing the same substance as the interfering substance giving an error to the determination in the case of determining the substrate, or one or more substances used as substrates for the enzyme, the activity of which is to be determined, in the case of determining the enzymatic activity, followed by colorimetrical determination. As the substrate to be determined according to this invention, there are exemplified triglyceride, cholesterol ester, creatininine, creatine and the like. As the enzyme, the activity of which is to be determined according to this invention, there are exemplified transaminases such as GPT, GOT amylase, and the like. According to this invention, the system containing the substance to be determined colorimetrically can be maintained under uniform conditions and there can be selected a suitable combination of color producing materials. Further, 2 naphthol or a derivative thereof represented by the formula I does not influence the color producing system comprising a coupler such as 4aminoantipyrine and a phenol derivative, a l naphthol derivative or an aniline derivative. This is because the compound of the formula I has a higher oxidationreduction potential to be oxidized by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of peroxidase than that of the color producing material developer such as a phenol derivative, a l naphthol derivative or an aniline derivative to be coupled with 4 aminoantipyrine, so that the phenol derivative, the l naphthol derivative or the aniline derivative seems to preferentially carry out the oxidative condensation with 4 aminoantipyrine. As the compound of the formula I , there can be used 2 naphthol, 7 hydroxy 2 naphthol, 2 naphthol 7sulfonic acid, 2 naphthol 3,6 disulfonic acid, 2naphthol 3 carboxylic acid, etc. As phenol and derivatives thereof used as developer, there can be used phenol, pchlorophenol, 2,4 dichlorophenol, p bromophenol, o chlorophenol, m chlorophenol, and the like. As aniline and derivatives thereof used as developer, there can be used aniline, N,Ndimethylaniline, N,N diethylaniline, N,N diethyl mtoluidine, 3 methyl N ethyl N ss hydroxyethyl aniline, N ethyl N 2 hydroxy 3 sulfopropyl m toluidine, 3,5dimethyl N ethyl N 2 hydroxy 3 sulfopropyl aniline, 3,5 dimethOxy N ethyl 2 hydroxy 3 sulfopropyl aniline, and the like. As l naphthol and derivatives thereof used as developer there can be used l naphthol, l naphthol2 sulfonic acid, l naphthol 2 carboxylic acid, l naphthol 8 sulfonic acid, l naphthol 3 sulfonic acid, l naphthol 5 sulfonic acid, and the like. As the coupler, there can be used 4 aminoantipyrine, etc. The first reagent solution comprises a compound of the formula I in an amount of usually 0.01 to 10 mM, preferably 0.1 to 0.5 mM, a peroxidase in an amount of usually 0.1 10 units ml, an oxidase in an amount of usually 0.05 20 units ml and, if necessary one or more substances for producing a substrate for the oxidase, used as a substrate for the oxidase, or used for an enzymatic reaction of a substrate with the oxidase depending on the kind of substrate or enzyme to be determined. The second reagent solution comprises a coupler such as 4 aminoantipyrine, a developer selected from phenol and derivatives thereof, l naphthol and derivatives thereof and aniline and derivatives thereof, and an enzyme necessary for producing the same substance as giving an error to the determination in the case of determining the substrate, or one or more substances for giving a substrate for the enzyme, the activity of which is to be determined, in the case of determining the enzymatic activity The enzyme necessary for producing the same substance as giving an error to the determination of substrate changes depending on the kind of substrate to be determined. The substances for giving a substrate for the enzyme, the activity of which is to be determined, changes depending on the kind of enzyme to be determined its activity. The first reagent solution and the second reagent solution may further contain, respectively, one or more buffering agents, surface active agents, stabilizers, and the like additives depending on purposes. As the buffering agents, there can be used convetionally used buffer solutions. The pH of the first and second reagent solutions is usually in the range of 5 to 9. The time necessary for decomposing hydrogen peroxide with the compound of the formula I to form a non coloring compound was measured as follows. To 3 ml of a Good s buffer solution having a pH 7, 10 units of peroxidase and 0.2 mM of the compound of the formula I were added. Subsequently, hydrogen peroxide was added to the resulting mixture so as to make the content of hydrogen peroxide 0.1 mM in the reaction sample, followed by incubation at 370C for a predetermined time. The time required for decomposing hydrogen peroxide for discoloring was measured by adding 0.3 mg of 4 aminoantipyrine and 3 mg of phenol to the mixture after the incubation to measure the production of color. The results are as shown in Table 1.As is clear from Table 1, the time required for discoloring is very short.

The experiments were conducted as follows. To 3 ml of 50 mM tris HC1 buffer solution pH 6.5 containing a combination of developer as shown in Table 2 and peroxidase 10 units , 20 p1 of a 10 mM solution of hydrogen peroxide was added and changes of degree of coloring were measured at near the maximum absorption wavelengths of the oxidative condensation products in the absence or presence of the compound of the formula I in an amount of 0.5 mM as listed in Table 2.
