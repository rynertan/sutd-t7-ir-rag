# Improvements in pitot tube type flow measuring devices and methods of mounting same in liquid gas two phase or multi phase systems.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a pitot tube flow measuring instrument for use in pipes characterized by a generally diamond shaped sensor portion 18 constituting a bluff body for splitting the flow that includes at least a larger radiused leading edge 40 in which three or more impact ports 36 are located, a pair of planar portions diverging rearwardly from the leading edge to a transversely spaced pair of much smaller radiused side edges 52L, 52R that cooperate therewith and the downstream facing portion of the bluff body to define flow separation zones capable of stabilizing the flow coefficient over a broad range of flow conditions provided that the distance separating them is at least five times either of their radii. The invention further includes a method of mounting the probe in two phase or multi phase flowing systems where one of the fluids is a liquid and another a gas that calls for tilting the axis of the sensing portion thereof at an angle to the horizontal such that quantities of the liquid are trapped in one end or the other depending upon whether the gaseous constituent is hot or cold.
