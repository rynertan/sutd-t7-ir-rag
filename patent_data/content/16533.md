# Anti perspirant compositions.

## Abstract
An anti perspirant composition includes 30 by weight of an anti perspirant agent, aluminium chlorhydrate, 68.5 by weight of ethanol and 1.5 by weight of a long chain fatty acid, myristic acid. The presence of the fatty acid counteracts the reduction in efficacy caused by the high concentration of ethanol.
