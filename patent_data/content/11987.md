# Process for improving the surface finish of the working surface of new or used endless steel belts for use in the casting of thin polymer sheets.

## Abstract
The surface of stainless steel belt used for casting plastics sheet is improved by first grinding the back surface of the belt until no further distortions can be removed and then grinding the mirrored surface of the belt until the mirrored surface is uniformly dull and then polishing the dulled surface to a mirrored finish. During the grinding and polishing, the belt is cooled to avoid local overheating.
