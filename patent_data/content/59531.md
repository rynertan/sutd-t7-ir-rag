# Controller for a vehicle having an electric traction motor.

## Abstract
A controller for the traction motor of an industrial truck comprises an actuator spool 56 which is axially shiftable by a manual selector member 12 for actuating a plurality of control switches 44, 46, 48 . Detent means 86, 78, 82, 84 hold the spool in forward, reverse or park positions and return spring 66 urges the spool toward neutral position. The actuator spool 56 is adapted for rotational movement about its axis for automatic release of the detent means and return of the spool to neutral position. A seat occupancy detector is actuated when the driver leaves the seat and imparts rotational movement to the spool which releases the detent means and returns the spool to neutral. The controller is also adapted to provide manual and automatic control of a parking brake. When the selector member is in the park position, cam means on the actuator spool actuates a control switch 48 to apply the vehicle brake. When the selector member is in the forward, reverse or neutral position the control switch is operative to release the brake with the driver on the seat if the driver leaves the seat the spool is rotated and actuates the control switch for applying the parking brake.
