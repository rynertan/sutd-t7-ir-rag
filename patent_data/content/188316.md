Goodfellow, Microbiological Classification and Identification, 1980 . Referring to Bergy s Manual of DeterminativeBacteriology, H. Ans G. Schlegel, The Prokaryotes, Vol.II 1981 , and the literature described in d concerning chemical classification of microorganisms, the strain S 6 is determined that it is a bacillus which is gram positive, negative in formation of spore, aerobic, has polymorpholis, and is negative in acid fastness.This strain contains therein meso diaminopimelic acid, arabinose and galactose, C16 n, F1 , C18 F1 andC19 10 CH3 as fatty acid types of acids, and C32 C46 mycolic acids as the mycolic acid type. Based on the above bacteriological characteristics, the present strain is identified as a bacterium belonging to the genus Rhodococcus. In cultivation of microorganisms as used herein, an ordinary culture medium containing a carbon source e.g., glucose, glycerol, and maltose , a nitrogen source e.g., ammonium. sulfate and . mmonium chloride , an organic nutrient source e.g., yeast extract, peptone, meat extract, soybean protein hydrolyzate, and corn steep liquor CSL , an inorganic nutrient source e.g., phosphate, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, and manganese , and so forth is used. This cultivation is aerobically carried out with stirring at a pH value of from 6 to 8 and at a temperature of from 20 to 350C, and preferably 25 to 300C, for from 1 to 3 days. In the practice of the process of the present invention, one strain selected from the above r.icro organisms is cultured for 2 to 3 days according to the above describes method, and the resulting cultures or cells separate from the cultures, or treated cells crude enzymes, i.mmobilized cells, etc. are suspended in water, a buffer or physiological saline water and then a nitrile compound is added thereto. The nitrile compound is acted on the cells by reacting an aqueous medium generally containing from about 0.01 to 10 wt of the cells and from about 0.1 to 10 wt of the nitrile compound at a temperature of from the freezing point thereof to 300C, and preferably the freezing point to 150C, at a pH of from 6 to 10, and preferably from 7 to 9, for a period of from 0.5 to 10 hours. Nitrile compounds used as a substrate are biologically very toxic, and exert serious adverse influences on the present enzymatic reaction. For this reason, the nitrile compound is gradually added in a controlled manner such that the concentration of nitriles in the system is preferably not more than 5 wt , and more preferably not more than 2 wt . If the pH value is outside the above define range, the amide formed and accumulated is further hydrolyzed, and the stability of the cells is reduced.Thus, it is preferred to control the pH value within the range of from 7 to 9 by gradually adding caustic alkali e.g., NaOH and NOTE , or by previously adding a buffer to the system. If reaction conditions are appropriately controlled, the desired amide can be formed and accumulated from the nitrile compound at a conversion value of nearly 100 , and with substantially no formation of by products. The amide thus formed can be recovered from the reaction mixture by commonly known techniques. For example, cells are separated from the reaction mixture by techniques such as centrifugal separation, treated with activated carbon, an ion exchange resin or the like to remove colored substances, impurities and the like, and then concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the desired amide, for example, acrylamide. The present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the following examples. All parts and percents are by weight. The various nitriles and their corresponding amides were quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography, and their corresponding organic acids by high performance liquid chromatography. EXAt oPLE 1 A strain, Rhodococcus sp. S 6, was aerobically cultured cn a medium pre 7.2 containing 1 of glucose, 0.5 of peptone, 0.3 of yeast extract, and 0.38 of meat extract at 300C for 48 hours. The cells thus formed were removed by centrifugal separation and washed with a 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.7 . This procedure was repeated to prepare washed cells of the S 6 strain water content 80 . A mixture of 0.5 part of the washed cells and 84.5 parts of a 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 8.5 was prepared, and then 15 parts of acrylonitrile was intermittently added with stirring at from 0 to 30C while controlling conditions such that the concentration of acrylonitrile in the reaction system did nct exceed 2 , to thereby subject the acrylonitrile to a hydration reaction. Addition of acrylonitrile was completed in about 3 hours. To ensure the completion of the reaction, stirring was further continued for several hours. Then, cells were removed by centrifugal separation to yield a clear solution. This solution contained 20 of acrylamide, and the yield of acrylamide was more than 99.9 .Unreacted acrylonitrile was not detected at all, and the proportion of by produced acrylic acid was not more than 0.1 based on the weight of the acrylamide . Water was distilled off from the clear solution at a temperature of not more than 500C the clear solution was concentrated to precipitate crystals. These crystals were recrystallized from methanol to yield colorless plate shaped crystals. This compound was identified as acrylamide based on melting point, elementary analysis, and IR.

After the cultivatinn was completed, cells were recovered by centrifugal separation and then washed with a 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.7 . This procedure was repeated to yield washed cells.
