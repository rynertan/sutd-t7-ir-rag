# BASE FILM FOR THREE DIMENSIONAL CONFORMABILITY

## Abstract
A film which combines excellent vacuum formability, ex cellent heat resistance during injection molding and excellent dimensional stability during printing of the film, and which can be suitably used as a base of a transfer film for three dimen sional conformability capable of satisfactorily printing onto the surface of an article having a complex three dimensional shape.
