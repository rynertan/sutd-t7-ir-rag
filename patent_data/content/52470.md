# Apparatus for the manufacture of objects of crystal polystyrene.

## Abstract
A process and an apparatus are disclosed for the manufacture of objects of crystalline polystyrene. The appa ratus comprises a screw extruder 8 having a die 10 with an outlet of adjustable profile, mounted at the end of the screw 9 of the extruder, a roller press 12 having a plurality of temperature adjustable rollers 13, 14, 15 and at least one pair of draw rollers 16, 17 to draw the sheet, at least one of said draw rollers being temperature adjustable, at least one sheet supporting roller 19 which is free to rotate about its own axis and is of low thermal conductivity at least on its surface, two switches 35, 36 controlling the build up of the sheet in the region between the pair of draw rollers 16, 17 and the sheet supporting roller 19 which can be activated by detection of the position of the sheet by means of mechanical sensors or photocells, a device 20 for heating both edges of the sheet which can be positioned in relation to the breadth of the sheet and adjusted for temperature in relation to the thickness and the distance moved by the advancing sheet, at least one drawing device having chains 22 and sprockets 22 , 22 acting on the edges of the sheet, at least one device 24, 25 for heating both sides of the sheet in relation to the part which is to be thermoformed, a forming device having a press component 29 , a device for removing objects from the press component 29 , a device 31, 32 for stacking the objects and a device 33 for grinding up the waste.
