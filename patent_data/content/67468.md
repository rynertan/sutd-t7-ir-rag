# Multifunctional coupling agent.

## Abstract
Lithium metal terminated polymers of one or more alkadienes, or of one or more alkadienes and one or more monoalkenyl arenes are coupled by reaction with a coupling agent of the general formula R₁ O Si R₂ O R₂ Si O R₁ ₃ where R₁ is an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R₂ is an alkyl group of 2 to 10 carbon atoms.
