# Copier frame.

## Abstract
Automatic reproducing apparatus frame assembly for mounting individual reproducing apparatus components thereto including a lower frame member 94 having a plurality of mounting elements 104 attached thereto for mounting at least one reproducing apparatus component 106 thereto, the mounting elements being spaced from each other and arranged in parallel across the frame member whereby components may be mounted to the frame member at one of the alternative mounting elements to provide the assembly of automatic reproducing machines having one of a plurality of process widths corresponding to the distance from one side of the frame member to one of the mounting elements. Preferably the lower frame member is a plastics molded frame and the plurality of mounting elements are integrally molded therein. The apparatus may include a rear mounting frame comprising a boot like cover 118 slidably engageable with the lower frame member, thereby providing a variable dimension frame assembly with common frames front and rear and the capability of using common drive modules and platen drive modules for copiers having different process widths.
