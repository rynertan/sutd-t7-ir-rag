## Description
A temperature indicator device for refrigerator apparatusThe present invention relates to a temperature indicator device for refrigerator apparatus including at least one freezer compartment suitable for the preservation of frozen foods, a compressor for compressing the refrigerant fluid, a condenser for condensing the refrigerant fluid coming from the compressor, at least one capillary tube for the expansion of the refrigerant fluid coming from the condenser, at least one evaporator for the evaporation of the refrigerant fluid coming from the capillary tube, and a return duct connecting the output of the evaporator to the input of the compressor.One of the current requirements for refrigerator apparatus is that of giving the user an indication of the temperature within the refrigerator cabinet, primarily relating to the freezer or the frozen food compartment in combined or double door refrigerator apparatus. In fact, the said apparatus must preserve foods generally for a long time and at a determined temperature, for which reason it is essential that the user should be continuously provided with discrete information on the internal temperature within the compartment itself such as, for example, if the selected temperature has been reached, if it is maintained at the desired level or else if, because of a power failure or other accidental causes, it is exceeded, or if the maximum admissible limit for the correct preservation of the foods has been definitely exceeded.To provide such temperature indication the said apparatus could be provided with a conventioral thermometer, but with such thermometers it would be necessary to open the refrigerator each time to find out the temperature with evident disadvantages and loss of cold air. To overcome these disadvantages it would be possible to use electronic thermometers, but their cost would be considerable.Therefore the subject of the present invention is that of overcoming the above mentioned disadvantages and providing a temperature indicator device for the freezer compartment of a refrigerator apparatus which signals to the user when the selected temperature has been achieved, if this temperature is maintained at the predetermined level or exceeded, and also if a maximum allowable limit is exceeded .Further objects of the present invention are that the said device should be of low cost and sufficientlyKprecise and reliable. To achieve these objects the subject of the present invention is a temperature indicator device for refrigerator apparatus including at least one refrigerator compartment suitable for the preservation of frozen foods, a compressor for compressing the refrigerant fluid, a condenser for condensing the refrig ant fluid coming from the compressor, at least one capillary tube for the expansion of the regrigerant fluid coming from the condenser, at least one evaporator for evaporating the refrigerant fluid coming from the capillary tube, a return duct connecting the output of the evaporator with the input of the compressor, characterised by the fact that there is provided an indication of the achievement and maintenance of the temperature selected by the user for the freezer compartment, by comparison means which compares the temperature in the freezer compartment with the selected temperature, and which control indicator means for indicating if the temperature of the cooling compartment is practically coincident or less than the selected temperature or else if the temperature in the cooling compartment is substantiallygreater than the selected temperature.Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become clear from the detailed description which follows, and from the attached drawings given purely by way of explanatory and non limitative example, in which in Figure 1 there is illustrated an electronic circuit diagram employed in the device forming the subject of the present invention.In this drawing there can be seen a resistance RI afle end of which is connected to the supply Vcc and the other of the ends of which is connected to the non inverting input of a threshold comparator 5 and to one end of a resistor R2 the other end of which is connected to the inverting, input of a threshold comparator 4 and to the non inverting input of a threshold comparator 6, and to one end of a resistor R3 and to one end of a resistor having a negative temper ature coefficient NTC 1 which is positioned in the frozen food compartment and is suitably ttballastedtt in such a way that its temperature substantially reproduces the temperature of the frozen food compartment.The other two ends of the resistor R3 and the NTC 1 are connected to a common conductor.A resistor R4 one end of which is connected to the supply Vcc and the other end of which is connected to one end of a resistor R5 and to an end terminal of a potentiometer 3 which includes a switch 2 the other end terminal of which is connected to the other end of the resistor R5 and to one end of a resistor R6, the other end of which is connected to earth. The switch 2 is located between the common conductor and earth and serves to earth the said common conductor.This switch, which we will call the energy saver is normally closed and is an integral part of the potentiometer 3. The central terminal of the potentiometer 3, which is connected to the wiper of the potentiometer, is connected to the non inverting input of the threshold comparator 4 to which there are also connected the inverting input of the threshold comparator 5, the cathode of a diode D1, and one end of a resistor R8 which provides the hysteresis for the threshold comparator 4 the other end of which is connected to the output of the same threshold comparator 4. The said output indicated with the letter A goes to control a thermostat circuit not shown in the drawings. The anode of the diode D1 is connected to the anode of a light emitting diode LED 8 and to one contact of a normally open switch 7 which we will call the fast freezer , the other contact of which is connected to the supply Vcc The cathode of the LED 8 is connected to one end of a resistor R7 the other end of which is connected to earth.The output of the threshold comparator 5 is connected to the cathode of a light emitting diode 9 the anode of which is connected to a terminal of a resistor R12 the other terminal of which goes to supply Vcc. A resistor R9 is connected at one end to the supply Vcc and at the other end to one end of a resistor Rlo the other end of which is connected to earth and to the inverting input of the threshold comparator 6, the output of which goes to the cathode of a light emitting diode 10 the anode of which is connected to one end of a resistor R11 and the other end of which is connected to the supply Vcc. The operation of the circuit described above is as follows the NTC 1 senses the temperature in the freezer compartment and together with the resistive networkR1, R2, and R3 provides a voltage proportional to the said temperature to the three threshold comparators 4, 5 and 6, in particular directly to the terminals of the inverting inputs of the threshold comparator 4 and the non inverting input of the threshold comparator 6, and indirectly, via the resistor R2, to the noninverting input of the threshold comparator 5.A voltage proportional to the temperature selected by the user is supplied to the non inverting input ter minal of the threshold comparator 5 via the potentiometer 3 and the resistive network R4, R5 and R6. A suitable fixed reference voltage is supplied by the divider formed by resistors Rg and R10 to the inverting terminal of the threshold comparator 6. The threshold comparator with hysteresis 4 is the element which controls the temperature within the compartment, whilst the other two comparators serve to supply indications to the user.As poittedoutalready, the voltage at the inputs of the non inverting terminal of the threshold comparator 5 depends on the resistance value of the NTC 1 and, consequently, on the temperature of the cooling compartment, whilst the voltage at the inputs of the inverting terminal depends on the temperature chosen by the user. Furthermore, the values of the resistors R1, R2 and R3 are chosen in such a way that the otuput of the threshold comparator 5 becomes low and therefore causes current to circulate in theLED 9 thereby lighting it up when the temperature of the cooling compartment has fallen to. the riconnection temperature of the compressor dependent on the temperature chosen by the user with a difference of 20C or to a lower temperature .The 20C of difference are a tolerance value deemed to be acceptable, which is imparted by acting onto the value of the resistor R2.For example, if the user has chosen a temperature of 0 0 18 C when the compartment reaches 16 C, the LED 9 lights up and remains lighting even if the temperature should fall further. The said LED 9 becomes extinguished cflly when the temperature in the said compartment again 0 exceeds 16 C. In this way the user has an indication of the achievement of the temperature LED 9illuminated , of the maintenance of that temperature LED 9still illuminated and of the exceeding of the said temperature LED 9extinguished . The fact that the LED9 remains illuminated even if the temperature in the freezer compartment is less than that chosen by the user does not create any disadvantage in that it does not matter if the foods being preserved are cooled to a lower temperature, on the other hand the thermostat circuit, not shown in the drawings, provides for the maintenance of the temperature within the limits chosen by the user.The function of the resistor R8 is also to be noted, this provides a variable reference value to the non inverting input of the threshold comparator 5, providing it with the same hysteresisas the threshold comparator 4.The values of the resistors Rg and R10 are on the other hand chosen in such a way that the output of the threshold comparator 6 becomes low and therefore causes a current to flow in the LED10, illuminating it when the temperature in 0 the cooling compartment becomes greater than 10 C. In this way the user has an indication LEDlO illuminated that the temperature level in the cooling compartment has risen above that at which the frozen foods can deteriorate.When the energy saver key 2 which is normally closed is open the supply voltage Vcc is passed to the inverting input of the threshold comparator 4, and this simulates a condition of very cold in the refrigerator compartment so that the output of the said threshold comparator 4 is such as to make the thermostat circuit block the operation of the said compartment. In this way, in the case of a combined or two door refrigerator apparatus the operation of the fresh food compartment is continued thereby obtaining a saving of energy when ever there are no frozen foods to preserve.When the faust freeze key 7 which is normally open is closed, the supply voltage Vcc is supplied to the non inverting input of the threshold comparator 4 and this simulates a condition of very warm in the cooling compartment so that the output of the said threshold comparator 4, through the thermostat circuit, makes the said compartment operate continuously, and at the same time the LEDS is also supplied with current and becomes illuminated.With this operation, indicated by the illumination of the LEDS, when fresh foods to be frozen are put into the refrigerator the minimum freezing time is obtained.It is to be noted, finally, that the NTC 1 is positioned within the freezer compartment and ballasted so that it substan.ially detects the temperature of the said compartment but does not feel the effects of the temperature changes due to the opening and closing of the door of the refrigerator apparatus thereby allowing the knob of the potentiometer 3 to be directly calibrated in degrees centigrade, which potentiometer as already seen, regulates the temperature within the freezer compartment. From the above description the advantages of the temperature indicator device forming the subject of the present invention ion will be clear. In particular there are shown the possibilities of having an indication which is sufficiently precise for the purposes which it serves, of the achievement of the selected temperature, of the maintenance of this or a lower level of temperature during the preservation phase, of the indication of the exceeding of a maximum admissible limit, at a very low cost for a reliable device.It is clear that numerous variations are possible to the temperature indicator device described by way of example, without by this departing from the scope of the principles of novelty inherent in the inventive idea.
