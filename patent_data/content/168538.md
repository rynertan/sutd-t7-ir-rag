# Clarifier.

## Abstract
A clarifier for removing particulate matter from a liquid comprises a chamber 1 defined by a cylindrical wall 2 having a top plate 8 and a funnel shaped floor 3 , the latter terminating in a cylindrical receptable 5 equipped with an outlet pipe 7 . The liquid to be clarified is introduced into the chamber through an inlet 34 arranged to direct the liquid into an annular space formed between the chamber wall and a flow pattern controlling device, typically in the form of a hollow, truncated cone 21 . The flow pattern may be modified by a further hollow truncated cone 25 . Clari fied liquid passing up through the truncated cones is dis charged through the aperture defined by a cylindrical mem ber 9 set in the top plate, the liquid passing into a trough 11 and thence to a collection box 13 for discharge through a pipe 14 . Scum and other floatable solids are collected in a box 18 for discharge through a pipe 20 . A floc blanket may be established within the chamber as an aid to clarif ication. A flocculating agent may be introduced into the chamber along with the liquid.
