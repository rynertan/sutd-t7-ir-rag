# Servo write head and method of writing magnetic servo information.

## Abstract
A servo writing transducer is shown having transverse side surfaces 33, 34 of the pole pieces 7 adjoining the gap formed to optimize compression of the fringe field at one transverse side 33 to reduce the dead band intermediate servo tracks. The existence of a wider fringe field region at the opposite transverse side 34 is without consequence since the servo writing procedure is to first write the farthest track at the transducer side at which the compressed field occurs followed by each succeeding, adjoining servo track causing the information written in the wide fringe field to be overwritten by the next track.
