## Description
NOVEL PLASMID VECTOR Background of the Invention The transformation of information in the form of naturally occuring or artifically constructed DNk from an originatinq source into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell lies at the heart of qenetic engineering.Transformation may be defined as the general process of unidirectional transfer of qenetic information in which DNA originating in one cell is taken up and stably maintained by another cell. Such DNA transfers take several forms. Between bacteria, the naturally occurring transfer of information on plasmids is conjugation. Viral DNk may be stably integrated into the bacterial chromosome in lysogenic infection only to be released at a later time in response to a derepressing stimulus. Other naturally occurrina forms of transformation include the formation of crown gall tumors in dicotyledonous plants under the influence of tumor inducing Ti plasmids contained in the bacterium Aqrobacterium tumefaciens A.tumefaciens . The deliberate transformation of prokaraotic cells has quickly become routine. However, the transformation of eukaryotic cells remains a substantial challenge since the genetic fine structure of eukaryotic cells is less well known. It is highly desirable to expand the range of host organisms that may be transformed by placing exoqenous DNx into cells of the host. In particular, it is desirable to develop methods and vectors for the transformation of eukaryotic cells including plants and animal cells. Control of replication, transcription, and translation of exogenous DNk is critical to the expression of characteristics delivered into the host cell in the form of DNA. It is of crucial LTportance that all these functions be compatible with the enzyme system of the host cell.Thus, the DNk to be employed in transforminq the host should include control sequences for the replication of the DNA, control sequences for initiating and terminating the transcription of genes the expression of which are desired, and control sequences that allow the transcript to be translated and expressed. A nunber of reports have described the transformation of plant cells using the bacterium A. tumefaciens carrying plasmids qenerally known to induce the crown qall tumor. Such plasmids are generally designatedTi plasmids. In nature, only dicotyledonus plants may be infected withA. tumefaciens at the site of wounds in the plant s tissue infection occurs when A. tumefaciens is introduced. In a course of such infections, the plants cells are transformed so that they grow in the absence of certain plant hormones when cultured and may produce opine compourdb that are utilized by the infecting A. tumefaciens organism. A gall or plant tumor, cocooned of these altered cells, forms. It has been reported that the Ti plasmid has been isolated and marker DNA sequences such as antibiotic resistance characteristics have been inserted into the Ti plasmid. The altered Ti plasmid is replaced in the A. tumefaciens and plants are infected with the bacteria containing the altered Ti plasmid. tolls tME plants so infected have been found to express the antibiotic resistance carried by the altered Ti plasmid. The transformation of plant cells using A. tumefaciens carrying a modified Ti plasmid is limited, however, to dicotyledonous plants to which A. tumefaciens is infective. Furthermore, it is necessary to alter the Ti plasmid so that normal plants can be obtained fran the transformed cells. Summary of the Invention The inventor has constructed a novel recombinant plasmid vector that may be used to effect transformation of host cells in addition to those susceptible of A. tumefaciens infections. In general the novel recombinant plasmid vector comprises a plasmid adapted for transformation of the host in that it reproduces in the host cell. Inserted into the plasmid to form the vector is at least one nucleotide sequence coding for a structural gene and control sequences for the transcription and translation of these structural genes. The structural gene may code for any characteristic or product desired to be expressed.Such structural qenes may be, for example, without limitation, a complex of genes allowinq enhanced amino acid synthesis, a gene or complex of genes conferrinq resistance to various environmental hazards includinq toxins, infectious agents, herbicides or antibiotics, a qene or complex of genes codinq for a desired product not otherwise produced in the untransformed cell, such as hormones, pharmaceutical precursors, phannaceuticals, interferon, insecticidal toxins and the like. Structural qenes may also include certain characteristics that may be used to identify transformed cells.Such identification characteristics are known within the art as markers and may include specific neculeotide sequences, drug resistances includinq antibiotic resistance, the ability to synthesis specific growth factors, sensitivity to particular compounds and the like. Positive markers, which are markers that permit the transformed host to survive and grow under conditions that kill untransformed hosts may be used. Such positive markers include antibiotic and drug resistances. Examples of antibiotic resistance includes ampicillin, kanamycin and tetracycline resistance. Druq resistance is further exemplified by the structural genes coding for methotrexate resistant dihydrofoliate reductase which makes the host, particularly eukaryotic hosts, resistant to the metabolic poison methotrexate. Marker sequences may be used to positively select hosts that have been transformed to have characteristics that are themselves not readily selectable, such as enhanced amino acid synthesis or sensitivity to environmental agents. Thus, methotrexate resistance can be used to screen cells that have been transformed by structural genes inserted into the host along with the structural gene coding for the characteristics of methotrexate resistance. Control sequences, which are DNA sequences required for the proper transcription and translation of the nucleotide sequence coding for the structural gene are also included in the novel reoombinant plasmid.Control sequences include a promoter which includes, as used herein, anRNA polymerase recognition site generally having a nucleotide sequence of thymidine alternating with adenine to qive a repeating sequence of IAI etc., TRInA etc., TATTTAAA etc., cAT etc. and a CAP site which is believed to provide a site for the binding of RNA polymerase and or a site for initiation of RNA synthesis. See DeGreve, H. et al. J. Mol. and App.Gen., 1982 1 499 511 and Depicker, A. et al., J. Mol. and Apo. Gen. 1982 1 566 573. The CAP site is located in the 3 direction fran theTATA etc. sequence and is spaced some 35 nucleotides therefrom. It is particularly desirable that the promoter function in eukaryotic cells. Thus, the promoter may be derived fran a eukaryotic cell or it may be capable of functioning in a eukaryotic cell although it is derived fran a prokaryotic source. Alternatively, the promoter may be synthetic. In particular, promoters derived from the Ti plasmid, which are prokaryotic, are known to function in plant cells. Promoters derived fran plasmid pTiA6, pTiAch5 and pTiT37 may be usable as promoters in the recombinant plasmid vector Which is described herein. Promoters derived from pTiA6 are particularly preferred. Other control sequences include a sequence for terminatinq transcription. In eukaryotic cells these transcription terminating sequences are thought to be 5 AATAAA 3 or sane variation to this sequence. . Amcnq the variant sequences that have been described are 5 AATAAT 3 , 5 AATAAG 3 , 5 GATAA 3 and 5 ATTAAA 3 . See DeGreve, H. et al., J.Mol. and App. Gen. 1982 1 499 511 Depicker, A. et al., J. Mol. andGen. 1982 1 566 573 Fitzgerald, M., and Shenk, T. Cell 1981 24 251260 and Haqenbuchle, O., Cell 1980 21 179 187. Transcripticn terminating sequences are found about 20 nucleotides fran the end of all eukary otic mRNAs. The terminator control sequence whether it is derived from a eukaryotic or non eukaryotic source should also function in the host cell and in particular, it nust function in a eukaryotic cell if the host is eukaryotic. In particular, it is desirable that the terminator function in a plant cell. A terminator that may be used in the recoobinant plasmid described herein may also be derived from the plasmid pTiA6. In general, the structural gene and control sequences will be inserted into a plasmid vector adapted for the transformation of the particular host to be used. Plasmid vectors are plassids into which an exogenous DNA sequence has been inserted. Plasmids are covalently closed circular pieces of DNA. The plasmid vector is introduced into the host cell and thus is a vehicle for carrying the exogenous DNA into the host.In the present invention, the host to be used is a eukaryotic cell, in particular a plant cell, and more particularly a corn plant or tobacco plant cell. It has been discovered that pBR327, a plasmid well known as a vector for transformation of prokaryotic hosts, surprisinqly is capable of replication in plant cells. Thus, the plasmid vector pBR327 is utilized as the novel vector described herein. However, it should be emphasized that any plasmid vector that is capable of replication in the particular host to be used is considered to be a suitable vector. It is an object of the invention to provide a novel reccmbinant plasmid oomprisiny a plasmid vector adapted for transformation of a host into which a DNk sequence oomprisinq a structural gene and control sequences for transcription and translation thereof is inserted. It is a further object of the invention to provide a plasmid vector adapted for the transformation of eukaryotic hosts into which a DNk sequence e compris ing a structural gene and control sequences s for the transcription and translation thereof has been inserted.It is yet another object of the invention to provide a novel plasmid adapted for the transformation of plant cells, particularly corn plant or tobacco plant cells, into which a flNA sequence comprising a nucleotide sequence codinq for a structural gene and control sequences for the transcriptions and translation thereof have been inserted. It is a further object of the invention to provide a novel plasmid vector adapted for the transformation of plant cells, particularly corn or tobacco cells, into which a DNX sequence ce comprising a nucleotide sequence coding for a positive marker, particularly methotrexate resistant dihydrofolate reductase and control sequences for transcription and trans laticn thereof is then inserted.It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a novel plasmid vector adapated for the transformation of plant cells, particularly corn plant or tobacco plant cells into which a positive marker, particularly methotrexate resistant dihydrofoliate reductase and a promoter and transcript terminator sequence for the transcription and translation of said positive marker have been inserted. Description of the Drawinqs These and other objects of the invention will be better understood with reference to the following figures in which Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the steps leading to the construction of pR11021 ATCC 39398 Fiqures 2, 2a and 2B are schematic representations of the steps leading to the construction of PR112048 ATCC 39399 and Figure 3 is a schematic representation of the steps leading to the construction of PI11129 ATCC 39396 . EXAMPLES Plasmid pBR327 is known to be stably maintained in corn plant cells in culture. Plasmid pBR327 is isolated from Escherchia coli strainLE392 hereinafter referred to as IE392 into which it has been previously transformed. pBR327 was isolated from LE392 by the Birnboim cesium chloride method. Birnboim, H.C., Doly, J. 1979 Nucleic Acid Research, Vol.7, 1513 1523. The isolated pBR327 is suspended in 10 millimolar nM hydroxymethylaminomethane Tris and 0.1 it ethylenediaminotetraacet ic acid EDTA at pH 8.0 at a stock solution concentration of between 500 micro grams ug and 1000 ug of plasmid 1R per milliliter ml . Working solution concentrations of the plasmid pBR327 DNA are diluted to about 250 ug of plasmid DNA per ml of solution.About 50 ug of pBR327 was digested with Hind III restriction endonuclease and Barn HI restriction endonuclease in the buffer salt solution suggested by the manufacturer New EnqlandBiolabs, Beverly, Massachusetts, hereinafter referred to as NEB . Although the double digest is carried out simultaneously in this example, it can easily be accomplished by sequential digest using Hind III and Barn HI. The restriction endonuclease digest is incubated at 370C until all DNA appears to be hydrolyzed. The incubation is terminated by heat inactiva tion. The digested plasmid DNA is first concentrated and then the digested DNA fragments are separated on a 1.5 low meltinq temperature agarose gel using a buffer of 40 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA adjusted to pH 8 using glacial acetic acid. The fragments are resolved on the gel after running for 45 minutes at a voltage of between 75 and 100 volts. The Bam Hind III digested pBR327 yields a 2.9 kilobase kb fragment and a 0.346 kb fragment. The linear 2.9 kb fragment having one sticky Bam HI and one sticky Hind III end thus obtained is of suitable purity for use as a vector for cloning of a structural gene. The structral gene is a DNA sequence coding for nethotrexate resistant dihydrofolate reductase MtxrDHFR previously cloned into plasnid Rx4 ATCC 39276 on deposit with the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland. Pçproximately 1.0 ug of this plasmid is digested with Bam HI and Hind III using the same conditions described for the digestion of pBR327. Following concentration, the digested MTX4 DNA is resolved by electrophoresis under the same conditions as described above for pBR327.The Bam HI Hind III diqested MTX4 yields twb linear DNA fragments, one 0.37 to 0.38 kb and the other 10.5 to 10.7 kg, each having one Bam HI sticky end and one Hind III sticky end, the smaller of the two DNA fragments beinq the one having the MtxrDHER nucleotide sequence. The aqarose gel band contianing the linear 2.9 kb pBR327 vector having Bam HI and Hind III sticky ends and the agarose band containing the MtxrDHFR nucleotide sequence having Bam HI and Hind III sticky ends are cut out of the gel, placed in a test tube and melted at 65 C at which temperature the agarose liquifies without harming the DNA. The tempera ture is reduced to 370C and the solution is diluted with distilled water. Lipase buffer NEB adenosine triphosphate ATP 0.5 mM and T4 liqase NEB are added to the DNx mixture to form a liqaticn mixture. The final ligation mixture is in a volume of about 100 ul, a volume in which the agar concentration is less than 0.1 . Ligaticn is carried out for about 2 hours at room temperature at approximately 20 22 C.Transformation of LE392 Approximately 20 ul of the ligation mixture is mixed with 200 ul of E. coli strain LE392 containing aproximateley 107 cells which are previously rendered competent by treatment with calcium chloride in a concentration of between 50 to 100 mM using a method decribed in Cohen et al., P.N.A.S. USx, 69 2110 1972 . The cells and the liqation mixture are held at oec for approximately 1 hour followed by heat shock at 37 C for 3 minutes. The calcium chloride concentration is reduced to below 20 mM by diluting the cells with a non selective growth medium L broth . The cells are held for approximately 1 hour in these conditions after which they are plated on selection media comprised of L agar containing 100 ug per ml of ampicillin. A nunber of anpicillin resistant colonies that grow up are replated on Gagar plates containing ampicillin and also on L aqar containing tetracycline. Colonies displaying ampicillin resistance and tetracycline senstitivity are retained, grown up and the plasmid is isolated using the Brinboim cesium chloride method. The isolated plasmid is again doubly digested with Bam HI and Hind III using the method described previously. Following concentration, the digests are resolved on a 6 acrylamide gel to confirm fragment size. The fragments are run with known size standards for markers. Two bands are obtained which are of the size expected for the MtxrDHFR DNA sequence and the Bam Hind III digested pBR327.The plasmid thus obtained was desiqanted pR11021 ATCC 39398 .Preparation of Control Sequences Pranoter Plasmid pTi A6 from A. tumefaciens was diqested into various fragments as described in Cell March 1980 , Vol. 19 729, which is herein incorporated by reference. Plasmid pNW31c 8 1 was obtained as described in that article. ltW31c 8 1, which contains a 7.3 kb Bam HI restriction endonuclease fragment, was further digested with VaI, an isoschizomere ofSmaI, and BglII restriction endonucleases. The resulting mix ofXmaI BglII fragments was cloned into plasmid pEen 15 which had been previously digested with XmaI and BglII restriction endonuclease.Plasmid been 5 is both chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistant, but the XmaI BglII digestion renders pBen15 kanamycin sensitive. The resulting plasmids were transformed into LE392. The thus transformed LE392s were grown on selection medium containing chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicol resistant colonies were counter selected for kanamycin senstitivity. Those colonies displaying chloramphenicol resistance and kanamycin sensitivity were grown on selection media and the plasmids were obtained again by the Brinboim cesium chloride method. The plasmids thus obtained were digested with xmai and BglII and the fragments were resolved by agarose qel elecrophoresis as described above to confirm the size of the bands contained in the plasmid.A plasmid thus obtained containing a 2.0 kb XmaI BglII fraqment was designated pL5381 pL5381 was digested with Sau 3A 1 restriction endonuclease to yield a 1.3 ko fragment having Sau 3A 1 ends. The 1.3 kb fragment is derived from the XMAI BglII fraqment of yW3lC 8 1 that had been previous ly liqated into pL5381. This 1.3 kb fragment, having Sau 3A 1 ends, was ligated into pBR327, which had been previously digested with Barn HI to yield Bam HI sticky ends catpatible with Sau 3A 1 ends. The liqation was carried out with ligase salts NEB , ATP 0.5 mM and T4Ligase to form plasnid pR100736 ATCC 39400 .LE392 was transformed with PR100736 under the transforming conditions described above. Transformants were selected for urpicillin resistance and tetracycline sensitivity. Plasmids from ampicillin resistant, tetracycline sensitive colonies were isolated t the Birnboim cesium chloride method, digested with Bam HI and run on a 0.7 agarose gel. A plasmid having a 1.3 kb fragment was isolated con firming the identify of pR100736. The 1.3 kb Sau 3A1 fragment carried by pR100736 was used as the source of promoter sequences in the following manner. About 100 ug of pR100736 was digested with Sau 3A1 NEB in a buffer solution of 50 mM sodium chloride, 6 mM tris HCl pH 7.5 , 5 mM magnesium chloride MgCl2 , 100 ug per ml bovine serum albiun BSA . The digestion is carried out for about 3 hours at 30 C, followed by heat inactivation at 65 C for 3 minutes and quenching on ice. The digested fragments are purified by electrophoresis on a 1.5 agarose gel using a buffer of 40 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA adjusted to pH 8 using glacial acetic acid.Size standards of ThgI digested pBR322 NEB are run on the sane gel. The purified 1.3 kb Sau 3A1 fragment is electroeluted, yielding about 30 ug of DNA. After two phenol extractions, this DNA is concen trated by ethanol precipitation to about 200 ug ml. About 20 ug of the concentrated 1.3 kb fragment is resuspended in approximately 40 ul of a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 12 mM Tris HCl, 12 mM mg Cl2, 6 mM mercaptoethanol, 100 ug ml BSA and approximately 150 units of MnlI restriction endonuclease. The digestion was carried out for approximately 3 hours after which it was stopped by heat inactivation at 650C for 3 minutes followed by quenching on ice. The resulting fragments were resolved by electrophoresis cn a 2 agarose qel using a buffer of 40 mMTris, 1 mM EDrA adjusted to PB 8.2 using glacial acetic. The electrophor esis was carried out at 100 to 150 volts for a period of time sufficient to resolve the fraaitnts between 2 and 5 hours. A 270 base pair fraament 0.27 kb was obtained by electroelution. The electroeluted 270 base pair fragment was extracted by phenol twice and then concentrated by ethanol precipitation as described above. The nucleotide sequence of a portion of the 270 base pair MNLI fragment has been detennined. This portion includes 110 nucleotides com prising the 3 end of the 270 base pair sequence. The 110 nucleotides have the following sequence as determined by techniques well knows to those skilled in the art see Bethesda research Laboratories BRL , UserManual, M13 Cloning Dideoxy Sequencing Manualo 1980, BRL, Inc., Gaithersblurg, Maryland 20760 and Nu, N., and Messing, J., Gene 1982 17 271 77 . 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 5 AAGCTTGAAAATTAAGCCCCCCCCCGAAATCATCGCCACAGGTCGTCCCAGCCCGGCATCTATATATAGCHindIIIEMI10.1 80 90 100 110 120 130 140GCCAATATAGTTTGTCTTACACAAACACACCTCACATCAT 3 EMI10.2 The repeatinq nucleotide pair TA between the bracket is bleived to be theRNA polymerase recoqnition site and the region around the A indicated by the arrow is believed to be the CAP site. The nucleotide sequence of the region in the 5 direction fran the HIND III site has not been determined. Since the 270 base pair fragment obtained by MnlI digestion does not always yield blunt ends, blunt ends can be restored to the fragment by one of two methods. The fragment may be incubated with DNA polymerase I in 10 mM ss mercaptoethanol, 60 nM Tris chloride 0 7.5 , 8 mM magnesium chloride and 0.2 mM deoxyadenosine triphosphate dATP , deoxythymidine triphosphate dTTP , deoxyquanosine triphosphate dTGP , and deoxycytidine triphosphate dCTP By using this method, missing deoxyribonucleotides are added to the 270 base pair fragment to yield blunt ends. Alternately, Mung bean nuclease Biolabs may be used to trim back unpaired 3 and 5 ends of the 270 base pair fragment to yield blunt ends.Preparation of Plasmid pR11021 for Liqation with the 270 base pair MnlI Fragment Plasmid pR 11021 having therein the nucleotide sequence coding for MtxrDHFR is obtained by the Brinboim cesium chloride method. About 50 ug of pR11021 is digested with about 150 units 6f Hind III restriction endonuclease in about 25 ul of 60 mM NaCl, 7 IrM Tris, 7 mM MgCl2, pB of 7.5 at 37 C. The DNA is concentrated by precipitation with ethanol. At this point, the plasmid pR11021 is a linear molecule with Hind III sticky ends having unpaired terminal bases at both ends.To complement the terminal bases of the linear pR11021 molecule, the molecule is incubated with about 30 units of Klenow fragment enzyme Boerhinqer Manheim , of E. coli DNA polymerase I in the presence of 0.02 uM each of dATP, dCrP, dTTP and dGTP, 20 mM ss mercaptoethanol, 60 mM Tris chloride at pH 7.5 and 8 mM magnesium chloride. After 3 hours at 1 60C this mixture is heat inactivated at 650C for 10 12 minutes and the DNA concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The DNk is resuspended in sterile water.The libation of the linear pR11021 to the 270 base pair MnlI fragment is accomplished in a buffer containing 0.4 mM ATP, 30 mM Tris chloride at pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Na2Cl, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, and 100 g ml BSA and aproxi mately 200 units T4 DNA ligase is added. The ligation is conducted for approximately 24 hours at 20 22 C. The resulting liqation mixture contains a variety of free DNA species as well as partial and complete ligation products. At least one of the complete ligation products is prised of the 270 base pair Mnl I fragment liqated into pR11021 to form a covalently closed ciruclar DE plasmid vector designated PR112048.Transformation of E. coli with the pR112048 liqation products 100 ul of resuspended competent E. coli cells are added to all of the previously obtained pR112048 ligation mixture in a sterile glass tube. Transformation is conducted at 0 C for approximately 1 hour. The cells are then heat shocked at 370C for 3 minutes, resuspended in 1.5 ml of L broth and allowed to incubate at 37 C for approximately 1 hour after which the culture is plated out on L agar medium plates containinq 100 well ampicillin. Plates are incubated for a period of time sufficient to allow ampicillin resistant colonies to grow.Colonies containing plasmid pR112048 are determined by replicate plating and colony filter hybridization analysis using the 270 base pair MnlI fragment labeled with 32P by nick translation as a probe, essentially as described by Grunstein, M. andHogness, D.S., 1979 P.N.A.S., USA, 72 3961 1971 Riqby, P.W. et al., 1977 , Mol. Biol. 13 237. Hybridization of the orobe was detected by autoradiography on Kodak X OMAT AR 5 film. Determination of Orientation of the Mnll Fragment Colonies hybridizing to the 32P labeled 270 base pair MnlI probe are cultured on Gagar with 100 ug ml ampicillin and the plasnid is isolated by the Brinboim cesium chloride method. To determine the orientation of the 270 base pair MnlI fragment in pR112048, the purified pR1 12048 is alternately digested with EcoRI and Hind III and Sall andBam HI. The MnlI fragment is known to have a Hind III site approximately 160 base pairs fran the 5 end thereof and therefore 110 bases from the 3 end thereof. An EcoRI site is known to be located approximately 30 base pairs in the 5 direction from the 5 end of the MnlI fragment.A Sal I site is known to exist approximately 665 base pairs in the 3 direction fran the 3 terminus of the properly oriented MnlI fragment. Thus, the plasmid having the properly oriented Mri1I fragment will yield anEcorI Bam HI fragment of approximately 490 base pairs and a Sal I one Hind III fragment of approximately 766 base pairs. Improper orientation will be characterized by Sal lAlind III fragment of approxiaately 816 base pairs. Other enzymes that can be used to test the constructicn arePsti Hind III and Hind III am HI.These double digests are run on a 5 acrylimide gel for between 3 to 5 hours in an appropriate buffer at approximately pH 8.0 and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide and exposure to ultraviolet liqht. Cells containing the plasmid that yield the predicted restriction endonuclease digestion fraqments are grown up onL broth.Preparation of Nucleotide Sequence Containing Poly A Site for Liqation Plasmid pL5351 is concentrated by ethanol precipitation to a working concentration of approximately 200 ug ml and is suspended in TrisEUTA buffer at pH 8.0. Approximately 40 ul of plasmid pL5351 are digested with Smal and Hind III in a buffer of 20 mM SCl, 6 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 , 6 mM MgCl2, 6 mM ss mercaptoethanol, 100 ug ml BSA. After digestion for approximately 3 hours at 37 C, the digestion is terminated by heating to 65 C for 3 minutes followed by quenching on ice. The SmaIHind III diqest results in a 1.2 kb fragment that is resolved by electrophoresis in an agarose gel and removed by electroelution as described above. The 1.2 kb fragment is concentrated by ethanol precipitation and resuspended at a concentration of approximately 200 mg ml in a Tris, EDTA buffer at approximately pH 8.0. An aliquot of the 1.2 kb fragment is digested with Sau 3A1 in a buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 6 mM TrisklCl pH 7.5 , 5 mM MgCl2 and 100 mg ml BSA. The digestion is carried out at 300C to completion. The digestion of the 1.2 kb fragment yields 4 fragments upon purification on a 2 agarose qel using a buffer of 40 1 1 Tris, 1 mM EDTA adjusted to pH 8 using glacial acetic acid. The 4 fragments are approximately 550 base pairs, approximately 480 base pairs, approximately 180 base pairs and approximately 8 base pairs in size.The 550 base pair fragment is electroeluted and concentrated by ethanol precipitation as described hereinabove to approdximately 200 uqvfnl and is used as a source of the Poly A signal sequence as described below. The 480 base pair sequence is also known to possess promoterlike activity. This 480 base pair sequence which has one Hind III end and oneSau 3A1 end has the following nucleotide sequence 10 20 30 40 50 60 70AAGCTTGAAAATTAAGCCCCCCCCCGAAATCATCGCCACAGGTCGTCCCGCCCGGCATCTATATATAGC HindIII 80 90 100 110 120 130 140GCCAATATAGTTTGTCTTACACAAACACACCTCACATCATGAATTTCGCAGATACTCCTTGGCCTCCCTC 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320 330 340 350ACACCTCAAATTTAAGGAGAAGGAAGGATTATCCTTCACTACCATAAAGCCAGCTG 360 370 380 390 400 410 420CAAAGTGATTTAACTTATTATGTCGCCATTTTTCAAAGCAACTATTTCCTGTGCGTTTCAAATCCAGAGA 430 440 450 460 470 480TGCCATAATCGCCCATTTCTGTACCCCATAGTAGCCCATGGATCC.

The transformation is carried out at 0 C for about an hour followed by heat shock at 37 C for about 3 minutes. The transformation mixture is diluted out with a non selective growth medium until the cal ci Lit ion concentration is less than 20 mM.The cell colonies containing the 550 base pair fragment are identified by colony hybridization using 32p labeled 550 base pair fragment probes labeled by nick translation. Those colonies hybridizing to the 32p labeled 550 base pair fragments are plated out and the completed plasmid is isolated by the Brinboim cesium chloride gradient method described above. The isolated plasmids are digested with Sau 3A1 and the digest fragments are resolved on a 5 acrylamide gel.Alternate Preparation of Poly A Containing DNA Sequence and Ligation WithPlasmid Vector pR112048 The sNA containing the polyadenylation signals can also be obtained as follows. A 4.65 kb Barn HI fragment fran pTiA6 previously cloned into pBr322 to form plasmid pBam 19 as described in Thomashaw et al., Cell, 19 729 1980 is isolated by digestion with Bam HI and purified by electrophoresis.
