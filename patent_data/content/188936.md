## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ACOUSTIC DIPOLE SHEAR WAVE WELL LOGGING BACKGROUND The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for dipole acoustic well logging and more particularly, to shear wave velocity logging in cased and uncased boreholes, with a dipole acoustic source. Furthermore, the invention relates to the determination of shear wave velocity logging in the presence of interfering acoustic borehole arrivals. An early and widely used technique of sonic logging measures the time required for compressional sound wave excited by a monopole axially symmetric source to traverse one foot of formation. This is known as the delta t measurement. See. e.g., Schlumberger Limited, The Sonic Log, Log Interpretation Volume 1,Principles, 1972. pp. 37 41. The velocity of another type of well known wave, the shear wave. also was found to be useful. and can be obtained from the conventional monopole sonic logging tool under certain circumstances. In conventional sonic logging, the shear wave is excited when the energy from the monopole source is mode converted and critically refracted at the borehole wall.Unfortunately, the shear velocity is not consistently available. For example, the shear velocity cannot be obtained directly in a relatively unconsolidated formation in which the shear velocity is less than or equal to the borehole fluid velocity. Under these circumstances, energy traveling at the shear velocity cannot be critically d refracted, so that no shear energy propagates along the borehole wall. Moreover, under some circumstances the shear energy is highly attenuated and obscured by the compressional arrival. As early as 1967, J.E. White proposed a tool for logging a whole family of wave types, including the shear wave, without relying on refraction. J.E. White, The HulaLog A Proposed Acoustic Tool, Paper 1, Transactions SPWLA,Eighth Annual Logging Symposium, 1967. The tool, which included four point force pad mounted transducers in contact with the borehole wall, was said to be capable of exciting four borehole modes the radial mode, the axial mode, the torsional mode, and the flexural mode. The radial and axial modes, illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, were considered similar to the source characteristics of conventional logging tools.The torsional mode, illustrated in Figure 3, was said to consist entirely of shear waves. The flexural mode, illustrated in Figure 4, was said to consist of shear waves coupled with substantial motion of the borehole wall. The vector lines in Figures 1 4 indicate the direction of the applied point force. Equal magnitudes are represented. Since the torsional and flexural modes of operation directly excite shear waves, shear events would be expected to be observable even in slow formations where critical refraction cannot occur. For the flexural mode, however, White found only a weak shear event from the slow shale formation. Since White, other contact or direct excitation transducers have been proposed. See, e.g., United StatesPatent Number 4,394,754, issued July 19, 1983 to Waters United States Patent Number 4,380,806, issued April 19, 1983 to Waters et al. and United States Patent Number 3,354,983, issued November 28, 1967 to Erickson et al. Contact apparatus of this type are generally undesirable in commercial applications, because they seriously limit the speed at which the well can be logged. White also proposed, for the flexural node, a logging tool having a source for providing a doublet or dipole type of excitation, effected indirectly through the borehole fluid rather than directly through contact of the transducer with the borehole wall. Each of the transmitter and receiver transducers comprise split half cylinders of barium titanate.Consider the transmitter, for example the half cylinders of the transmitter are driven by opposite polarity voltage, whereby one half cylinder emits a positive pressure pulse and the other emits a negative pressure pulse. See United StatesPatent No. 3,593,255, issued July 13, 1971 to White. Other types of logging systems employing indirect dipole excitation sources have been proposed for shear wave logging. Kitsunezaki proposed a dipole source having a coildriven bobbin. The movement of the bobbin ejected a volume of water in direction perpendicular to the borehole axis, while sucking an equivalent volume of water from the opposite direction. See United States Patent Number 4,207,961, issuedJune 17, 1980 to Kitsunezaki see also United States PatentNumber 4,383,591, issued May 17, 1983 to Ogura. Other transducer designs for providing indirect excitation dipoles incorporate bender type elements. The design described in European Patent Application PublicationNumber 31,989, published July 15, 1981 and naming Angona andZemanek as coinventors, includes two disc like piezoelectric elements bonded together and encased in a plastic potting compound. See also United States Patent Number 4,383,308, issued May 10, 1983 to Caldwell. Several theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the physics of the acoustic energy generated by the indirect excitation dipole transducer. White s analysis of a tool similar to that disclosed in United States Patent No.3,593,255, supra, assuming a source frequency of 12.5 kHz, did not suggest that a large shear event would occur hence, White did not conclude that the method looked promising. See 3. . White, The Hula Log A Proposed Acoustic Tool, supra.Kitsunezaki ignored the borehole except for transducerborehole coupling, reasoning that the wave length of the acoustic energy is sufficiently longer than the borehole diameter. See C. Kltsunezaki, A New Method of Shear WaveLogging , Geophysics, Volume 41, Number 10, October 1980, pp.1489 1506. He treated the wave field by approximating the environment as an infinite homogeneous solid medium, and predicted that the source pulse would propagate nondispersively in the axial direction at the shear velocity of the formation. The flexural mode has bee theoretically studied in the literature for the case of an empty borehole. See A.Bostrom A. Burden, Propagation of Elastic Surface WavesAlong a Cylindrical Cavity and Their Expiation by a PointForce, J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 72, No. 3, September 1982, pp. 998 1004 and for a fluid filled borehole, see W. Roever,J. Rosenbaum, T. Vining, Acoustic Waves from an ImpulsiveSource in a Fluid Filled Borehole, J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 55, No. 6, June 1974, pp. 1144 57 R. Kumar E S. Ram, Flexural Vibrations of a Fluid Filled Cylindrical Cavity in an Infinite Solid Medium, Acoustica, Vol. 22, 1969 70, pp.163 71. Yet, the flexural mode remains poorly understood, especially in contrast with the familiar tube mode. Studies based on actual data also have been performed. The OYO Corporation in Japan has pursuedKitsunezaki s shear logging method using his dipole source.See K. Ogura, wDevelopment of a Suspension Type S Wave LogSystem, Report No. 1, OYO Technical Note TN 34, OYOCorporation, Urawa Research Institute, Japan, November 1979 K. Ogura, S. Nakanishi, and K. Morita, Development of aSuspension Type S Wave Log System, Report No. 2, OYO Technical Note TN 39, OYO Corporation, Urawa ResearchInstitute, Japan, November 1980. A phenomena not predicted by Kitsune aki1s theory was noted specifically, the frequency content of the direct shear wave was found to be strongly dependent upon the shear speed itself formations with slow shear speeds produced a lower frequency direct shear wave than formations with faster shear speeds. The selection of frequency characteristics of dipole sources used in well logging applications has been considered to some extent. It is known generally that the frequency of a dipole source influences the efficacy of shear wave excitation and detection. The frequency range of the transmitter transducer disclosed in the Angona et al. application is about 1 to 6 KHz, with a predominant frequency of about 3 KHz. Despite these accomplishments, it is believed that the measurement of shear velocity using dipole and multi pole sources remains imprecise under certain conditions commonly encountered in borehole logging. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to improve the precision of the dipole shear wave measurement. It is another object of the present invention to avoid the effect of interfering acoustic borehole arrivals on a dipole shear wave measurement. It is another object of the present invention to obtain an accurate acoustic dipole shear wave log in the presence of a significant flexural mode arrival. These and other objects are achieved by a method and apparatus for directly obtaining the shear velocity of a formation traversed by an open or cased well. A plurality of waveforms are obtained from a dipole acoustic investigation of the formation relative to a common location in the borehole. In this investigation, the bandwidth of the waveforms is substantially bounded by an upper frequency fu at and below which energy traveling at the shear velocity is dominant. Moreover, the bandwidth of the waveforms is concentrated near the frequency fu. The shear velocity of said earth formation and or the flexural mode phase velocity as a function of frequency are determined from these waveforms. In one embodiment, the waveforms obtained from a broadband dipole acoustic investigation are low pass filtered, and an interim shear velocity vs is determined from the filtered waveforms. The filtering and determining of vs are done first for an initial fcut, and subsequently for additional decreasing values of fcut, until a preselected relationship between fcut and vs is satisfied. The last determined v5 is the shear velocity. In another embodiment, a set of waveforms limited by an upper bound source frequency fux is obtained from the dipole acoustic investigation, and an interim shear velocity vs is determined from the waveforms. The obtaining of waveforms and the determining of v5 is done first for an initial fux, and subsequently for additional decreasing values of fux, until a preselected relationship between fux and v, is satisfied. The last determined v is the shear velocity. In yet another embodiment, the set of waveforms is obtained from a band limited dipole acoustic investigation, limited by an upper bound source frequency. In yet another embodiment, a plurality of sets of waveforms limited by respective upper bound source frequencies fux are obtained from the dipole acoustic investigation. Respective interim shear velocities vs are determined from the sets of wÅaveforms, and the interim vs is identified for which a preselected relationship between the value thereof and the corresponding fux is satisfied. The identified vs is the shear velocity. In another embodiment, and where there is present a significant flexural mode arrival, if a low frequency asymptote is identifiable from the flexural mode phase velocity, it is reported as the shear velocity. If a low frequency asymptote is not identifiable, however, a plurality of additional curves of the flexural mode phase velocity as a function of frequency are theoretically determined, based on respective estimated shear velocities. These theoretically determined curves are respectively fitted to the curve determined from the waveforms, until a satisfactory least error fit is achieved. The last estimated shear velocity is reported as the shear velocity of the formation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A borehole logging system in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally in Figure 5. A fluid filled borehole 10 is shown traversing earth formation 20. A dipole acoustic logging tool 50, a mandrel device adapted for movement in the borehole 10, is connected to surface equipment and instrumentation 40 by an armored multiconductor cable 30. The cable 30 is used to raise and lower the tool 50 through borehole 10, and to this end passes over a sheave wheel 32 to a suitable drum and winch mechanism not shown , an element of the surface equipment 40. Surface equipment 40 also includes a suitable measuring wheel mechanism not shown , which rotates as a function of the movement of the cable 30 to measure the depth of the tool 50 in the borehole 10. The tool 50 includes dipole transmitter 56, spaced apart from dipole receivers 58 and 59 in transducer cartridge 54. Two receivers are preferred, although the present invention also contemplates the use of only a single receiver or the use of more than two receivers. Transducers 56, 58 and 59 preferably are of the indirect excitation type, such as disclosed in the aforementioned European patent applicationPublication Number 31,989, which is incorporated herein by reference, or in UK Patent Application Publication Number 2,124,337, published February 15, 1984 and naming Winbow andChen as coinventors, which is incorporated herein by reference.Downhole circuits for controlling the excitation of the transmitter 56, the reception of signals through receivers 58 and 59, communications, other functions of tool 50, and possibly some signal processing, are contained in electronics cartridge 52. The cartridge 52 is coupled to surface instrumentation 40 via the conductors in cable 30.Surface instrumentation 40 includes other circuits for communications, power distribution, and signal processing.The signal processing functions may be performed by dedicated circuits or one or more general purpose processors or microprocessors, as desired. The electrical systems of tool 50 and surface instrumentation 40 are shown in greater detail in Figure 6, it being understood that the selection and integration of elements shown in Figure 6 are illustrative only, and that other arrangements are possible. The firing of transmitter 56 is effected through amplifier 64 by pulse former 62, under the control of microprocessor 80 through transmitter interface 60.The resulting acoustic waves are detected by receivers 58 and 59, the outputs of which are amplified by gated amplifiers 72 and 73 respectively, and applied to analog to digital converters 74 and 75 respectively. Amplifiers are gated under the control of microprocessor 80, through receiver interface 70. The digitized waveforms are provided to microprocessor 80, wherein they are stored for transmission to the surface and or for downhole processing, as desired. Control signals and data are exchanged between downhole electronics 52 and surface instrumentation 40 via downhole telemetry systems 90 and 92 respectively. Downhole telemetry 90 is coupled to microprocessor 80, while uphole telemetry is coupled to processor 94. Microprocessor 80 is any suitable custom or general purpose microprocessor.Processor 94 is any suitable general purpose minicomputer for controlling the logging operation and analyzing downhole data.Also communicating with processor 94 are a field engineer s control console 96, various other I O devices 97 such as mass storage units and film recorders, and a tool depth indicator 98. The present invention may be better understood through a theoretical analysis of waveforms attributable to a dipole source operating in both slow and fast formations, along with a comparison of the dipole source waveforms with waveforms attributable to the well known monopole source operating in both slow and fast formations. As used herein, the term slow format ion1 means a formation having a shear velocity less than the mud velocity, and the term fast formation means a formation having a shear velocity greater than the mud velocity. Waveforms associated with the well known monopole source include a compressional wave, a shear wave, a tube mode also referred to as the low frequency Stoneley wave and normal modes. The normal modes only exist in fast formations, and each normal mode has a low frequency cutoff. In a slow formation, the shear wave is small relative to other arrivals, and is essentially absent ih the waveforms. At low frequencies, the tube mode dominates all other arrivals in both slow and fast formations. Waveforms associated with a dipole source have been found to include a compressional wave, a shear wave, a flexural mode, and normal modes. The compressional and shear waves and the normal modes excited by the dipole are similar to those excited by the monopole. The normal modes are similar in that they exist in fast formations and always have a low frequency cutoff. As used hereinafter, the term flexural mode in a physical sense refers to a bending vibration supported by the borehole. The propagation of this bending, or flexing, is analogous to the propagation of the vibration of a string when it is plucked. A dipole source in effect, plucks the hole by pushing it sideways at some point along the hole. This disturbance then propagates axially. It is a mode in the sense that different frequencies are excited by different amounts and travel at different speeds. The term flexural mode has been used differently in the art. For instance,White s usage of the term included all waves excited by the so called shaker source, including shear waves, the flexural mode as used hereinafter, and normal modes. The flexural mode is unlike the tube mode in most respects. While neither mode has a cutoff, the flexural mode weakens with decreasing frequency, relative to other arrivals and particularly relative to the shear. The tube mode strengthens with decreasing frequency, relative to other arrivals. Hence, below a certain frequency, the shear wave will dominate the flexural mode. This result is in distinct contrast to the monopole case, and explains why a dipole source tool can log shear waves in both slow and fast formations. The pressure field on the axis of the hole due to a dipole source is, in principle, identically zero. Thus, an array of isotropic pressure sensors placed uphole will detect no signal. In order to sense the dipole field, an array of dipole receiving elements was used. Dipole receivers sense the horizontal component of particle acceleration, velocity, displacement, or pressure gradient, in the same direction in which the source is pointed. Each of these field quantities is non zero on the axis. In the following analysis, the measuring of particle acceleration, which is proportional to the horizontal pressure gradient across the axis, was assumed.An array of monopole receivers was used to sense the monopole field. The analysis proceeds with reference to Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10, each of which consists of three sets of four waveforms. Within each set, the four waveforms correspond to receivers placed at spacings of 4, 8, 12 and 16 feet from the source. The arrows placed on the time axis of each waveform mark the theoretical arrival time of the compressional C , shear S and fluid F energy, as predicted by ray theory. Note that from waveform to waveform the moveout of the compressional, shear and fluid arrival times is linear. The three sets of waveforms in each figure correspond to the use of a source pulse with a different center frequency. In each figure, the first set corresponds to a 1 kflz source, the second to a 5 kHz source, and the last to a 10 kHz source.Figure 7 corresponds to the monopole in a fast formation Figure 8 corresponds to the dipole in a fast formation Figure 9 corresponds to the monopole in a slow formation and Figure 10 corresponds to the dipole in a slow formation. The model parameters which describe the fast and slow formations are given in the following table. TABLE 1 Parameter Fast Slow Formation Formation density ratio 2.0 2.0 borehole radius cm 10.0 10.0 Poisson s ratio 0.25 0.25 fluid speed km s 1.50 1.50 shear speed km s 2.0 1.20 compressional speed km s 3.464 2.078 The fast formation monopole case is illustrated inFigure 7. With a 1 kHz source pulse waveforms 100, 102, 104 and 106 , the tube mode is seen to dominate the waveforms.All other events are orders of magnitude smaller and cannot be seen. Note also that the velocity of the tube mode is not equal to the shear velocity. With a 5 kNz source pulse waveforms 110, 112, 114 and 116 , the tube mode is much smaller relative to faint compressional arrivals and strong shear arrivals. With a 10 kHz source pulse waveforms 120, 122, 124 and 126 , compressional and shear arrivals are evident. Normal modes, which were cut off when lower frequency sources were used, are evident. The fast formation dipole case is illustrated inFigure 8. With the 1 kHz source pulse waveforms 130, 132, 134, and 136 , a bundle of energy is seen to propagate at the shear speed of the formation. This bundle has been found to be a combination of the shear wave and the low frequency portion of the flexural mode. With the 5 kllz source pulse waveforms 140, 142, 144, and 146 , the flexural mode is seen to be the dominant event in the waveforms, traveling slower than the shear speed. The compressional wave is not visible on this scale. With the 10 kNz source pulse waveforms 150, 152, 154, and 156 , the normal modes are strongly excited.These are the higher frequency waves which begin to arrive at the shear arrival time. The flexural mode is much lower in frequency and can be seen as the last event in the waveform. Compressional and shear waves are visible. In summary, from the standpoint of shear logging in a fast formation, the dipole source gives a sizeable shear event for all source frequencies. Furthermore, the waveform is particularly simple at lower frequencies where the only event in the waveform is traveling at the shear speed. Nonetheless, the compressional arrival is apparent only at the higher frequencies. The slow formation monopole case is illustrated inFigure 9. With the 1 kHz source pulse waveforms 160, 162, 164 and 166 , a strong tube wave is obtained, much as in the fast formation instance. With the 5 kHz and 10 kHz source pulses waveforms 170, 172, 174 and 176, and waveforms 180, 182, 184 and 186 respectively , the slow and fast formations cases are greatly contrasting. In the slow formation case, the waveforms consist of a compressional wave and a tube mode.The shear event is not visible, and no modal arrivals are found. This result is predicted by ray theory, and has been observed in field waveforms. The slow formation dipole case is illustrated inFigure 10. The results obtained with the 1 kHz source waveforms 190, 192, 194 and 196 are of great interest, in that the energy in the waveforms is seen to travel at the shear velocity of the formation. With the 5 kHz and 10 kllz source pulses waveforms 200, 202, 204 and 206, and waveforms 210, 212, 214, and 216 respectively , the slow formation dipole case is analogous to the slow formation monopole case, insofar as only the compressional wave and the flexural mode are significant arrivals. It has been discovered that the energy in the waveforms 190, 192, 194 and 196 which travels at the shear velocity of the formation, is a combination of two phenomena, the flexural mode and the shear wave. In principle, shear velocity can be obtained at low frequency, since the shear wave dominates at low frequency. In practice, dipole shear logging preferably is conducted not outside of a range of frequencies. An excessively low frequency will not sufficiently excite the shear wave, while an excessively high frequency will excite interfering waves. It also has been discovered that while use of frequencies greater than the upper bound frequency results in waveforms dominated by the flexural mode for example, as with the 5 kHz pulse , the shear velocity may be determined from the flexural mode.This is because the propagation characteristics of the flexural mode are controlled primarily by the shear speed of the formation. Moreover, it has been discovered that compressional wave dipole logging can be achieved at or above the upper bound shear logging frequency. Hence, dipole shear logging either below the upper bound frequency or derived from the flexural mode are powerful and robust logging techniques, capable of providing continuous and accurate shear velocity measurements in slow and fast formations alike. Direct Shear Velocity Dipole Logging It has been discovered that direct shear velocity logging with a dipole source should be performed over a range of frequencies bounded at the upper end by the frequency fu, the frequency at and below which acoustic energy propagates at the formation shear speed, and above which energy does not propagate at the formation shear speed. Moreover, it has been discovered that preferably, frequencies at or just below f u should be used, because significant amplitude reduction of the shear wave occurs as frequency decreases. The frequency f u depends upon the borehole radius, which is generally a known quantity, and upon the formation shear velocity, the value of which is to be determined. The existence of the upper frequency is evident from a perusal of curve groups 220, 230, and 240 of Figure 11, which show the dispersion and excitation of the flexural mode for several fast and slow formations and of curve groups 250, 260, and 270 of Figure 12, which show the tradeoff between the shear wave and the flexural mode for three different formation models. In Figure 11, the 6 curves of each curve group 220, 230 and 240 correspond to respective formations having shear speeds of 1 km s, 1.2 km s, 1.4 km s, 1.6 km s, 1.8 km s, and 2 km s. Poisson s ratio for each formation was taken to be 1 4. All other model parameters are the same as in Table 1 above. The curves of group 220 show phase velocity of the flexural mode as a function of frequency. The velocity has been normalized by the shear speed of the formation. Note that, in all the formations, the phase velocity of the flexural mode tends to the shear speed of the formation at low frequencies. At high frequencies, the phase velocity curve for any particular formation is seen to asymptotically approach a final value, given by the velocity of a Stoneley mode on a planar liquid solid interface. This Stoneley speed is different for different formations. The curves of group 230 show group velocity of the flexural mode as a function of frequency, in the same format as the curves of group 220. As in the case of the phase velocity, the group velocity tends to the shear speed at low frequencies, and to the Stoneley mode speed at high frequencies. The curves of group 240 show the magnitude in dB of the residue of the flexural mode pole as a function of frequency, in the same format as the curves of group 220. The curves of group 240 reflect the degree to which the mode is excited at each frequency. Note that the flexural mode is resonant in nature in that It drops off considerably at both low and high frequencies. The mode becomes more r.esonant and smaller in amplitude as the formation becomes slower. Note also that the frequency where the mode peaks is roughly the frequency where the group velocity is a minimum. This means that most of the energy will arrive toward the end of the flexural mode arrival. In Figure 12, the formations have shear speeds of 1 km s curve group 250 , 1.4 km s curve group 260 and 1.8 km s curve group 270 . As before, all other model parameters are as in Table 1. Each of the curve groups 250, 260 and 270 show the excitation of the flexural mode, which is the same at all offsets from the source, and the excitation of the shear wave for source offsets of 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 feet. The shear wave is resonant in nature, similar to the flexural mode, particularly in the slower formations. The amplitude of the shear wave decreases with offset due to geometrical spreading , however, and can be either larger than or smaller than the flexural mode. At higher frequencies, the flexural mode dominates the shear event, while the reverse is true at lower frequencies. From curve group 250, it is apparent that at lower frequencies, the shear wave is larger than the flexural mode. The reverse is true at higher frequencies, however. Moreover, at the frequency where the flexural mode is strongest, the mode is 20 db factor of 10 larger than the shear wave at a receiver offset of 3 feet, and 40 db factor of 100 larger than the shear wave at a receiver offset of 15 feet.The frequency at which the shear wave and flexural mode are of equal amplitude depends weakly upon the source to receiver offset, and is referred to as the crossover frequency. The crossover frequency at larger offsets is lower than that at shorter offsets. Curve groups 260 and 270 are similar in character to group 250, and illustrate the effect of changing the formation properties. While the curves of group 250 correspond to a slow formation, the curves of group 270 correspond to a fast formation1 and the curves of group 260 correspond to a formation between slow and fast.The commentary associated with curve group 250 applies equally well to curve groups 260 and 270. Note that the crossover frequency tends to increase as the formation shear speed increases. The quantitative determination of the upper frequency f can be achieved in three different ways. The frequency u may be set equal to the frequency at which the phase velocity of the flexural mode is within a selected percentage, for example one percent, of the formation shear speed. The frequency u may be set equal to the frequency at which the group velocity of the flexural mode is within a selected percentage, for example one percent, of the formation shear speed. The frequency fu may be set equal to the frequency at which the amplitude of the formation shear speed is equal to that of the formation flexural mode i.e. the crossover frequency . A determination of the upper frequency using each of these three methods follows. The frequency at which the phase velocity of the flexural mode is 99 of the formation shear speed is given by vs fu t 1 a where c ranges from 0.154 in the fastest to 0.178 in the slowest of the formations represented by group 220. The frequency at which the group velocity of the flexural mode is 99 of the formation shear speed is given by v5 fu t 2 a where c ranges from 0.117 in the fastest to 0.126 in the slowest of the formations represented by group 230. The crossover frequency is obtained from curve groups 250, 260 and 270. The crossover frequency depends upon the source to receiver offset. Since the crossover frequency decreases with increasing offset, we use the crossover frequency at the largest anticipated offset as our standard, which in this case is 15 feet. Using the crossover frequency associated with the largest offset insures that at all shorter offsets, the shear wave will dominate the flexural mode. From curve groups 250, 260 and 270, then, the crossover frequency at fifteen feet offset is given by v5 f c 3 where C ranges from 0.128 in the fastest to 0.137 in the slowest of the formations represented by groups 250, 260 and 270. Each of these three different approaches for quantitatively determining the upper frequency are reasonable, yet the upper frequency fu predicted from group velocity is less than that predicted from amplitude crossover, which in turn is less than that predicted from phase velocity.Fortunately, the upper frequencies computed using these three approaches are not dramatically different. In the preferred embodiments to follow, the upper frequency fu is defined as the frequency at which the phase velocity of the flexural mode is 99 of the shear speed of the formation. The choice is based on the use in the preferred embodiments of such velocity estimation techniques such asSlowness Time Coherence, see C.V. Kimball and T.L. Marzetta, Semblance Processing of Borehole Acoustic Array Data, Geophysics, Vol. 49, No. 3, March 1984, pp. 274 81 UnitedStates Patent Application Serial Number 593,932, filed March 27, 1984 Kimball et al., sonic Well Logging1 , which are incorporated herein by reference.When applied to an array of recorded borehole waveforms, the velocity estimation techniques produce estimates of the phase velocity of the arrivals, provided that the arrivals are nondispersive or dispersive but narrowband. It is preferable, but not necessary, that the selected velocity estimation technique and the definition of u involve the same parameter. In this way, below the upper frequency the Slowness Time Coherence technique will produce the shear speed of the formation to within 18 accuracy. With the phase velocity criterion selected for defining the upper frequency, the scale factor c can vary from 0.154 in fast formations to 0.178 in slow formations. The value of c may be simplified to a constant nominal value for all formations of interest, provided the selected value will not predict upper frequencies that are excessively high. The value 0.15 is suitable. Nonetheless, the choice is not overly sensitive, and values of 4 varying from 0.12 to 0.18, for example, will not dramatically degrade performance. Hence, the upper frequency f, u is defined for practical purposes as v5 fu 0.15 4 a The range over which fu can be expected to vary in practice is limited. The large majority of boreholes drilled for oil and gas exploration and production range in radius from 7.62 cm to 13.33 cm, while shear velocities in earth formations vary from 0.5 km s to 4 km s. Based on the largest likely shear speed of 4 km s and the smallest likely hole size of 7.62 cm, the highest upper frequency likely to occur is about 8 kHz. Based on the lowest shear speed of 500 m s and the largest hole size of 13.33 cm, the lowest upper frequency likely to occur is about 500 Hz. Although the range over which u can be expected to vary is limited, it is preferable to log at the highest possible frequencies without exceeding the u for the formation and borehole in question. The reason is that amplitude reduces as the square of frequency. Specifically, according to A.L.Kurkjian, Radiation from a Low FrequencyHorizontal Acoustic Point Force in a Fluid Filled Borehole, Expanded Abstracts, 54th Annual International SEG Meeting,Borehole Geophysics I, December 1984, pp. 5 7, which is incorporated herein by reference, the amplitude of the dipole shear wave at low frequencies behaves as f2 vs V 22 for f 0.05 and z 5 v5 z a f According to expression 5 , the shear wave amplitude decreases with decreasing frequency, increasing offset z, increasing density , and quickening formation shear velocity wvS. This result assumes that the transmitter applies a specified force, and that the receiver senses particle acceleration. The importance of logging with frequencies at or near the upper frequency is well illustrated by curve groups 250, 260 and 270 of Figure 12. For example, assume ignorance of the property that the upper frequency increases with increasing shear speed, and suppose that a 1 kHz narrowband source has been randomly selected. Group 250 illustrates that fortuitously, the source frequency is quite near the crossover frequency fc fc and the received signals would be expected to contain a dominating shear wave. On the other hand, groups 260 and 270 illustrate that a significantly weaker shear wave would be obtained.Although the 1 kHz narrowband source would have been appropriate for logging the formation to which group 250 relates, a 1.5 kHz narrowband source would have been significantly better for logging the formation to which group 260 relates, and a 2 kHz narrowband source would have been better for logging the formation to which group 270 relates. In summary, direct shear wave logging using a dipole source should be conducted with frequencies limited at the upper end by the frequency flu. u The lower limit of the preferred frequency range is relatively unimportant, but acoustic energy is wasted if the source spectrum is not concentrated near the frequency fu A preferred method for dynamically determining the optimal dipole shear logging frequency is illustrated inFigure 13. The method of Figure 13 requires that the transducers 56, 58 and 59 have a broadband frequency response for well logging purposes, rich in frequencies over the range of 500 Hz to 8 kHz, as illustrated by curve 290 in Figure 14.In accordance with the analysis above, this bandwidth is suitable for most formation types and hole sizes likely to be encountered in practice. The waveforms are obtained in step 400 by energizing transmitter 56 with a suitable pulse supplied by pulse former 62 and amplified by amplifier 64.The timing of the pulse is directed by microprocessor 80, through transmitter interface 60. Propagating acoustic energy is detected by receivers 58 and 59, the outputs of which are amplified by gated amplifiers 72 and 73 under control of microprocessor 80 through receiver interface 70. Waveform data is digitized by converters 74 and 75, and provided to microprocessor 80. In step 402, the borehole radius a at the given depth is obtained, either from mechanical or ultrasonic caliper measurements taken by well known techniques or from an assumed nominal value, and supplied not shown to microprocessor 80. The detected waveforms for a given depth step 400 will include energy traveling at the shear velocity of the formation, but quite likely also will include energy traveling slower than the shear speed at frequencies above the upper frequency. The slower traveling energy is removed by low pass filtering the detected waveforms. Since the upper frequency fu is not initially known, a suitable low pass filter cannot be selected a priori. Nonetheless, an initial low pass filter can be applied to the waveforms, and the result tested to determine whether the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter was low enough. Accordingly, an initial estimate for the cutoff frequency f cut is selected at step 404. An initial value of 8 kHz is suitable, since as explained above, it is the greatest upper frequency that would be expected to be encountered in practice. The detected waveforms are filtered at step 406 with a low pass filter characterized by the selected fcut. The filter may be implemented digitally on microprocessor 80, or may be implemented digitally on processor 94 microprocessor 80 acting as a buffer for the digitized waveforms , or may be implemented by well known analog filter circuits before being supplied to converters 74 and 75. A velocity v5 then is determined from the filtered waveforms at step 408, either by microprocessor 80 or processor 94, using such known techniques as the Slowness Time Coherence, for example, which is discussed above. A determination Is made at step 410 as to whether cut is suitable low. A frequency f is computed in accordance with the expression f 0.15 vs a 6 and t is compared to fcut. If fcut is too high, then v5 will be too low because of the flexural wave and the condition fcut t will not be satisfied. The frequency fcut is reduced by some suitable amount at step 412, and steps 406, 408, 410 and 412 executed iteratively until the condition at step 410 is satisfied. The amount by which f cut is reduced preferably is inversely proportional to fcut f 7 In this way, if fcut and f are far apart, then a large reduction in f cut is achieved in the next iteration, whereas if fcut and f are not far apart, then a small reduction in fcut is achieved in the next iteration.Alternatively, the current value of t may be substituted as the next value of cut On the other hand, if fcut is at or below fu, the preferred upper bound frequency, then v5 will be correct and f will be greater than or equal to fast. The condition cut f having been satisfied, v5 will be reported as the shear velocity at step 414. Alternatively, the frequency of the transmitter transducer 56 may be electronically adjusted to the optimal frequency, as illustrated in Figure 15. In step 420, initial parameter values for pulse former 62 are selected, such that the upper bound frequency fux of the transmitter 56 initially is 8 kHz, as discussed above. The borehole radius a is obtained in step 422, essentially as described supra with reference to Figure 16. The transmitter 56 is excited and waveforms obtained at step 424, as described above with reference to Figure 13. A value for vs is determined either by microprocessor 80 or processor 94 at step 426, and tested for accuracy at step 428, essentially as described above with reference to Figure 13.If the test is not satisfied, fux is lowered at step 430, and steps 424, 426, 428 and 430 are executed iteratively until test 428 is satisfied. The value of v5 then is reported as the direct shear measurement at step 432. A simple but less adaptable technique for measuring shear velocity requires that transducers 56, 58 and 59 be selected with a narrow bandwidth and an upper frequency f ux satisfying the condition Vs min fux 0.15 8 amax where amax is the maximum borehole radius of interest and s mi n is the slowest shear velocity of interest. For example, if amax 13.33 cm and vS min 0.5 km sec, then f 500Hz. Yet another simple technique requires that a logging tool be provided with several groups of transmitter and receiver transducers, such that the transducers of each group have common frequency characteristics different that the frequency characteristics of the other groups. The measurement provided by the highest frequency group satisfying the condition fcut f described above is selected as the proper shear velocity measurement. The techniques described above generally are applicable to a cased borehole as well, although additional considerations are present. These considerations lead to frequency criterion for a reduced effect of the flexural and casing modes, by which the dominant signal in the receiver waveforms will be the formation shear wave. The analysis proceeds with reference to Figure 16. A group of curves 450 illustrates flexural mode phase slowness the inverse of modal phase velocity and another group 460 illustrates flexural mode residue a quantity indicating the strength of the mode being excited by a dipole source in the borehole for three cases of interest an unbonded cased hole at 452 and 462, a well bonded cased hole at 454 and 464, and an open hole at 456 and 46. The formation is fast, i.e. the formation shear speed is faster than the speed of the acoustic waves in the borehole mud. The slowness curves of group 450 all approach the formation shear slowness at low frequencies, although the frequencies at which the flexural mode approaches the shear slowness is higher than in the open hole. One reason for this is the small diameter of the cased hole.The residues illustrated by the curves of group 460 indicate that the flexural mode in cased holes is excited at higher frequencies. Hence, the upper frequency selected for open hole logging in accordance. with expression 4 will suffice for logging cased holes as well. Moreover, an upper frequency for cased hole logging can be selected in accordance with expression 4 , with a being the radius of the casing.Similarly, the methods of Figures 13 and 15 and others discussed above apply to cased holes, with waw being the radius of the casing. In selecting an upper frequency for cased hole logging, however, the effect of the casing mode also must be considered. Casing modes arise in unbonded and poorly bonded casings. The modal phase slowness group 470 , attenuation group 480 , and residue group 490 of the casing mode is illustrated in Figure 17 for three different kinds of formations, having the following compressional and shear slownesses 50 and 85 microseconds foot respectively, curves 472, 482 and 492 100 and 170 microseconds foot respectively, curves 474, 484, and 494 and 150 and 255 microseconds foot, curves 476, 486 and 496. It has been discovered that the casing mode cuts off in this example at about 6 kHz, and that the cutoff frequency is insensitive to the rock formation outside of the cement layer. The casing mode has a very fast phase velocity near the cutoff frequency group 470 .The mode attenuates above the cutoff frequency group 480 , and its strength of excitation drops off near the cutoff frequency group 490 . Hence, dipole logging in a cased hole should be conducted below the cutoff frequency of the casing mode. The casing mode cutoff frequency fcmc is determined from the dimensions of the casing, in accordance with the expression vcasing fcmc 0.16 9 rcasing where vcasing is the shear speed of the casing material in cm sec, casing is the mean radius of the casing in centimeters, and fo, is the casing mode cutoff frequency in hertz. The cutoff frequency is relatively insensitive to the casing thickness. For most commonly encountered cased wells, the casing mode cutoff fcmc is higher than the flexural mode cutoff fu, and presents no danger if the upper frequency u is selected based on either the open hole direct shear criterion or the cased hole direct shear criterion.When the shear from flexural technique, which is described below, is being practiced in the cased hole in accordance with either open hole or cased hole criteria, care should be taken not to exceed the casing cutoff frequency. Shear Derived from the Flexural Mode It has been discovered that the frequency content, amplitude and velocity of the flexural mode is sensitive to the shear speed of the formation. The present invention may be better understood from a consideration of the basis for this discovery, followed by a description of an embodiment of the present invention. The dispersion and excitation of the flexural mode for several fast and slow formations is shown in Figure 1l, which was discussed above in detail. From that discussion, the curves of groups 220, 230, and 240 can be seen to support the discovery that the flexural mode is sensitive to the shear speed of the formation. Moreover, it has been discovered that changes in the Poisson s ratio, the fluid velocity and the density ratio all have a relatively small influence on these curves. Changes in the borehole radius has the effect of scaling the frequency axis. Hence, where borehole radius is known, the flexural mode is controlled primarily by the shear speed of the formation. A method for determining shear velocity from the flexural mode is illustrated in Figure 18. Waveforms are obtained for each borehole depth at step 300 by energizing dipole transmitter 56 with a suitable pulse supplied by pulse former 62 and amplified by amplifier 64. The timing of the pulse is directed by microprocessor 80, through transmitter interface 60. Propagating acoustic energy is detected by an array of detectors such as, for example, dipole detectors 59 and 59, and amplified by gated amplifiers 72 end 73, under control of microprocessor 80 through receiver interface 70.The detected acoustic signals are respectively digitized by converters 74 and 75, and the waveform data furnished to microprocessor 80. Waveform dbta is stored by microprocessor 80, and then transmitted to the surface processor 94. Subsequent processing may be performed either by microprocessor 80 or processor 94. First,a digital representation of the curve Vfl f , the phase velocity of the flexural mode as a function of frequency, is obtained at step 302 by applying such techniques as the maximum likelihood method or Prony s method to the received waveforms. The maximum likelihood method and its application are described in X. Hsu, 1Application of the Maximum Likelihood Method to SonicVelocity Logging, Extended Abstracts, 54th AnnualInternational SEG Meeting, Borehole Geophysics Sessions,December 1984, pp. 1 3, which is incorporated herein by reference. Prony s method and its application are described in T.W. Parks, J.H. McClellan, and C.F.Morris, tAlgorithms for Full Waveform Sonic Logging, Transactions, IEEE ASSPWorkshop on Spectral Estimation, November 1982, which is incorporated herein by reference. At step 304, a test is made to determine whether the velocity information includes low frequency data. If so, then the shear velocity is the low frequency asymptote of the flexural mode phase velocity. This low frequency asymptote is reported at step 306. A visual representation appears inFigure 19, wherein vfl f is represented by curve 308 and the low frequency asymptote by line 309. If the frequency information does not include a low frequency asymptote, as shown by curve 310 in Figure 20, further processing is required. The goal of this further processing is to find a value for v5 such that vfl f , a theoretical curve of the flexural mode velocity as a function of frequency, fitsVfl f . Additional information is required to generate vfl f , however. Using conventional borehole logging tools and conventional techniques, the following parameters are measured at step 320 a, the borehole radius , the density of the formation mud the density of the borehole mud vc the velocity of the compressional wave and vmud the fluid velocity. An initial estimate for vs, the shear velocity, also is required and is performed at step 322. In most logging situations of practical interest, vfl f is slower than the formation shear velocity, and a suitable initial estimate is vs 1 1.1 vfl fp . Essentially, the low frequency flexural mode velocity merely is increased by a suitable percentage, such as 10 . The frequency p is defined as the frequency at which energy is maximum, and is determined on the basis of standard spectral analysis techniques. Specifically, as illustrated by curve 313 pf Figure 20, the energy content of the signal is determined as a function of frequency from aFourier transform of the signal.The frequency fp is identified at the energy peak E p A second boundary condition is that the shear velocity must be less than 0.707 of the compressional velocity, vc, since Poisson s ratio is greater than 0 for materials encountered in logging. Hence, the estimate of v5 is bounded as vS l min 0.707vc, l.lvfl fp 10 Having values for all required parameters, vfl f is determined for the given vs at step 324, as follows. The following equation is solved for kz.a11 a22 a33a44 a43a34 a23 a32a44 a42a34 a24 a32a43 a 42a33 a21 a12 a33a44 a43a34 a13 a32a44 a42a34 11 a14 a32a43 a42a33 0Expressions for a11, ..., a44 are as follows a11 jn Yf 12 a21 f pxs2Jn Yf 13 a12 Hn 1 Yc 14 EMI32.1 a32 2x 2Hn 1 Yc 16 EMI33.1 a13 Hn 1 Ys 18 a14 nHn 1 Ys 19 EMI33.2 a33 xz2 Ys2 Hn 1 Ys 22 a34 nxz2 Hn 1 Ys 23 EMI33.3 whereEMI34.1 xz kza 29 xs ksa 30 kmud vmud kc vc ks vs and 2 f , and where n is taken equal to unity, p denotes the density of the formation, f denotes the density of the fluid mud in the hole, Hn 1 denotes a Hankel function of order n and type 1, n denotes a Bessel function of order n, and the primes are shorthand notation for aa aa for example, Jn gamma f a Jn gamma f a nJn gamma f gamma fJn 1 gamma f 31 The curve vfl f is generated beginning at frequency fmax. Specifically, at f fmaxt equation 11 is evaluated repeatedly, each time using a different value of kz. Perhaps 100 values of k are tried in a range associated with physically reasonable sound velocities.The value of kz which comes closest to satisfying equation 11 is selected as an initial guess of the kz associated with the flexural mode at f fmax. Following this, the Newton Raphson method is used to locate the value of kz more accurately. The method and its application are discussed in R.W. Hamming, Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers, Second Ed., 1962, pp. 68 70, which is incorporated herein by reference. Frequency then is lowered by f, selected on the basis of temporal allaying. Specifically, if the time duration of the flexural mode arrival is denoted by T seconds , then af Hertz should be chosen less than or equal to 1 T. The initial guess for k at f f f is given by f af k f f k f 32 fUsing this initial guess, the Newton Raphson method is again applied to equation 11 to find kz f af . The frequency is reduced incrementally and the sequence repeated until the curve vfl f is generated. Having obtained vfl f , a test is made at step 326 to determine if vfl f fits vfl f in the frequency band between fl and f2. This frequency band would have been determined earlier, in step 322 for example, while determining fp using standard spectral analysis techniques. The frequencies fl and f2 are defined as frequencies for which the energy is some selected amount lower than the energy peak. The amount preferably is a factor of 10, i.e., if the energy peak is Epr and occurs as fp, then fl and f2 are the frequencies at which the energy is equal to Ep lO These relationships are illustrated by curve 313 of Figure 20. The curve fitting problem can be expressed in two ways. Find vs such that EMI35.1 is minimum, subject to Vf1 f V5 0.707vc Find vs, such that EMI36.1 is minimum, subject to Vfl f vs 0.707vc.The approach to solving these problems need not be described, since it is well known in general. See, e.g., Hamming, supra at 427 29 least squares and at 478 mini max . At step 326, a determination is made of the error of the fit between vfl f and Vfl f . In Figure 20, for example, the fit between curves 310 and 312 is poor, while the fit between curves 310 and 311 is good. Denoting the initial estimate of vs as vs0 and the associated error as computed from expression 33 or expression 34 as 0, a second vs, denoted as vI, is computed using vS 1.05v5. The error associated with the second v5 is E . Subsequent estimates of v5 are computed using the relationshipEMI36.2 for k 2,3,.. 35 and the process is continued until the vsk are no longer changing, indicating that the iterations have converged. One suitable test, for example, is vsk vsk 1 vsk 0.01 A preferred method involves computing the error using expression 33 or expression 34 for a variety of values ranging from 0.5 km sec to 4 km sec steps 330, 326 and 328 iteratively , and reporting the value of v5 that results in the least error step 332 . While the present invention has been described with reference to several particular embodiments, it will be appreciated that the embodiments are illustrative only, in that the invention is not intended to be limited to the disclosed embodiments. Variations and combinations within the spirit and scope of the invention may occur to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, these variations are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention, as defined by the following claims.
