# APPARATUS FOR X RAY ABSORPTION FINE STRUCTURE SPECTROSCOPY

## Abstract
Apparatus 10 for obtaining EXAFS data of a material 11 . A lens 12 directs a pulse of radiant energy 13 from a laser 14 onto a metal target 15 to produce X rays 16 of a selected spectrum and intensity at the target 15 . A baffle 17 directs X rays 16 from the target 15 onto a spectral disper sive monochromator 18 which directs the spectrally resol ved X rays 16R therefrom onto a photographic film 20. A film of material 11 is located in the path 22 of only a portion 16L of the X rays 16 throughout a selected spectral band, and the resolved X rays 16R directed onto the photographic film 20 form two separate images thereon comprising a reference spectrum 26R representative of a portion of the X rays 16U throughout the selected band that was not affected by the film of material 11 and an absorption spec trum 26A representative of a portion of the X rays 16L throughout the selected band that was modified by transmis sion through the film of material 11 . The laser pulse 13 , typically has a width of less than about 10 nanoseconds, and the material 11 may be in a highly transient state.
