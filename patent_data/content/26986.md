## Description
Polymerisation Catalysts This invention relates to metal compositions in which an organometallic compound and a transition metal organometallic compound are chemically bonded to a substantially inert matrix material, and to processes for the polymerisation of olefinically unsaturated monomers using such compositions as initiators. Transition metal compositions in which an organometallic compound of a transition metal of GroupsIVA to VIA of the Periodic Table of Elements is chemically bonded to a substantially inert matrix material are described and claimed in our British Patent No 1,314,828. Further in our British Patent No 1,475,184 there is described a process for the polymerisation of ethylene and propylene and the copolymerisation of ethylene with mono a olefins, especially butene l and hexene l, using a catalyst comprising a Group IVA transition metal hydrocarbyl compound supported on particulate alumina in which the group IVA metal compound is of a very high degree of purity, so as to increase the degree of incorporation of the said other olefin in the product copolymer. The Group IVA metal hydrocarbyl compounds useful in the practice of the invention claimed in British Patent Nos.1,314,828 and 1,475,184 are commonly produced by reacting a Group IVA metal compound, e.g. the halide, with a hydrocarbyl compound of a Group I to III metal. The term very high degree of purity means that the ratio of the amount of Group IVA metal to the amount of Group I to III metal in Group IVA metal hydrocarbyl compounds is at least 100 1, each expressed in gram atoms. We have now found that when the matrix material is reacted with a Group IA, IIA or IIB metal hydrocarbyl compound and then reacted with the Group IVA metal hydrocarbyl compound stable chemical entities are produced which may be used as initiators for the polymerisation of olefinically unsaturated monomers and certain of which may have higher activities than the corresponding GroupIVA transition metal compositions disclosed in BritishPatent No 1,314,828. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides a metal composition which is the product of reacting a particulate support material, preferably having a reactive surface as hereinafter defined which is free from water with firstly an organometallic compound of the general formulaEMI2.1 and secondly a transition metal organometallic compound of the general formulaEMI2.2 wherein M is a metal of Groups IA, IIA or IIB of the Periodic Table,T is a transition metal of Group IVA of the PeriodicTable,R1 and R2 are hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl groups,X, when present, is a singly charged anionic ligand or a monodentante ligand, m is 1 or 2 depending on whether the metal is in GroupIA or in Group IIA or IIB and p is 0, 1 or 2. All references to the Periodic Table are to the version of the Periodic Table of the Elements shown in Advanced Inorganic Chemistry by F A Cotton andG Wilkinson, 3rd Edition, Interscience Publishers, 1976. Hydrocarbyl groups of different types may be associated with a single metal atom. The hydrocarbyl group RÚ preferably is an alkyl group containing less than 20 carbon atoms and more pre ferably an alkyl group containing 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The metal M is preferably lithium, magnesium or zinc. A preferred class of Group IA, IIA or IIB metal hydrocarbyl compounds are those which are soluble in a liquid hydrocarbon, e.g. toluene, hexane. Examples of Group IA, IIA or IIB metal hydrocarbyl compounds include n butyl lithium, t butyl lithium, neopentyl lithium, dialkyl magnesiums such as dibutyl magnesium and diethyl zinc. Preferred organometallic compounds R4êTXR are p those in which the transition metal T is zirconium, or hafnium. The monovalent ligand X, where it is present, is preferably a halogen. Suitable hydrocarbyl groups R2 include straight chain and cyclic alkyl groups and substituted derivatives thereof and alkenyl groups including w alkenyl groups such as n allyl and substituted derivatives thereof, e.g. tetrakis s allyl zirconium or hafnium, tetrakis methylallyl zirconium or hafnium and zirconium tris n allyl bromide. The hydrocarbyl group R2 is preferably a substituted alkyl group of general formulaEMI4.1 which is a bonded to the Group IVA transition metal T through the carbon atom as indicated. Preferably all the groups R2 have general formula III, but it is possible for some of them to comprise other hydrocarbyl groups. Suitable substituent groups Y include aromatic and polyaromatic groups such as phenyl and naphthyl, giving rise in general formula III to the alkaryl ligands benzyl and l methylene l naphthyl and ring substituted derivatives thereof, for example p methyl benzyl. Y may also be a cycloalkenyl group, such as a cyclo octenyl group. Y may also comprise a group of general formulaEMI4.2 where Z represents carbon, silicon, germanium, tin or lead, and R3 which may be the same or different, represents a hydrocarbyl group, for example alkyl especially methyl or aryl especially phenyl . The group R3 3 of formula IV preferably contains a mixture of alkyl especially methyl and aryl especially phenyl groups, for example when R3 3 is dimethylphenyl. Examples of this preferred class of Group IVA transition metal compounds R4TXp include zirconium and hafnium tetra benzyl , zirconium tetrakis p methyl benzyl , zirconium and hafnium tetrakis l methylene lnaphthyl , zirconium tetrakis trimethylsilylmethylene , zirconium tetrakis neopentyl and zirconium tetrakis neophyl . Examples of preferred Group IVA transition metal compounds R4TXp containing monovalent ligands X include tris r allyl zirconium chloride, bromide or iodide and the equivalent s methallyl and benzyl compounds. By reactive surface we mean a plurality of sites on, and preferably attached to, the surface of the substantially inert particulate support material, which sites are capable of abstracting, e.g. a magnesium hydrocarbyl from a solution thereof. Preferably the said sites are OH groups chemically bonded to the surface of the particulate support material and the particulate support material is an inorganic material. Where surfaceOH groups are present they are capable of acting as a proton source, that is they have an acidic function.Such a material will be substantially inert in that, whereas the said OH groups are capable of reacting with, say, the Group IA, IIA and IIB metal organometallic compounds and the Group IVA transition metal organometallic compounds the bulk of the support material is chemically inert. Particularly good examples of such support materials are silica and alumina or mixtures thereof. These comprise a matrix of silicon or aluminium and oxygen atoms, to the surface of which OH groups are attached, the hydrogen atoms of said groups having an acidic function. However, apart from the presence of these OH groups, silica and alumina are generally regarded as chemically inert. Within the terms silica and alumina we include silica and alumina based materials containing small amounts of other suitable inorganic oxides, such as magnesium oxide and zinc oxide. The preferred support material is alumina. It is essential that the support material is freed from adsorbed water, as this would merely react with and destroy the organometallic compounds. The support materials may be readily freed from such adsorbed water, by, for example, a simple thermal treatment. The reaction between the support material andGroup IA, IIA or IIB organometallic compound or Group IVA transition metal organometallic compound comprises displacement of one or more of the hydrocarbyl groups by the hydrogen atom of an OH group or groups of the support material, with liberation of the corresponding free hydrocarbon. When the Groups IA, IIA or IIB organometallic compounds are reacted, we have found that the hydrocarbyl group of the Group IA organometallic compound or one of both hydrocarbyl groups of the Group IIA or IIB organometallic compounds may at least in part be displaced by OH groups of the support material, with liberation of the corresponding free hydrocarbon. However, the GroupIA, IIA or IIB metal hydrocarbyl compounds may additionally react with the support material without liberation of the corresponding free hydrocarbon. When the Group IVA transition metal organometallic compounds are reacted, all except one of the hydrocarbyl groups of the organometallic compound may be displaced by OH groups of the support material, so that there is at least always one hydrocarbyl group attached to the transition metal in the product. This appears to be independent of the number of reactable hydroxylic groups present on the surface of the support material. The number of reactable hydroxylic groups, that is, the number available for reaction with Group IA, IIA and IIB organometallic compounds and Group IVA transition metal organometallic compounds will depend on the nature and condition of the support material. For example, in some materials, because of their molecular configuration, some of the hydroxylic groups present are not reactive under our conditions. The progress of the reaction with the Group IA,IIA, IIB organometallic compounds is most conveniently followed by analysis of the supernatant solutions.Reaction of the Group IVA transition metal organometallic compounds occurs in substantially the same way as disclosed in our British Patent No 1,314,828. The number of reactive hydroxylic groups present in a given weight of support material will depend upon its nature for example, whether it is silica or alumina and its condition for example, its surface area and the treatment it has received to remove absorbed water . Thus the precise composition of metal compositions according to our invention may vary from one batch or sample to another of the same support material but successive portions of the same material prepared under identical conditions will give products having the same composition. The ratio of gram atoms of Group IA, IIA or IIB metal to gram atoms of Group IVA transition metal in the metal compositions of the present invention may be varied within wide limits. Typically the ratio is between 0.05 1 and 100 1, preferably 0.1 1 to 25 1, although higher ratios are not deleterious to catalytic activity. The proportion of Group IVA transition metal organometallic compound in the metal compositions of the present invention is suitably in the range 0.01 to 1.0 millimole g, and preferably in the range 0.05 to 0.5 millimole g. Compositions according to the present invention may be prepared by first contacting a solution of theGroup IA IIA or IIB organometallic compound with a suitable support material, in the absence of free or adsorbed water. The solvents used for the compounds should be dry and inert hydrocarbon solvents are preferred. The support material is then contacted with aGroup IVA transition metal organometallic compound.Since many of the transition metal organometallic compounds which may be used in our process are thermally unstable, the reaction temperature must be maintained low enough to avoid decomposition of the compounds. With some compounds, temperatures below OOC are required. An alternative method for preparing metal compositions according to our invention comprises, first, adding excess of either a Group IVA transition metal organometallic compound or a Grignard reagent magnesium hydrocarbyl compound to the support material, determining the number of molecules of hydrocarbon liberated, and then adding to a further sample of the support material GroupIA, IIA or IIB metal organometallic and Group IVA transition metal organometallic compound which in combination are up to the amount required to liberate an equivalent amount of hydrocarbon. For example, a sample of the support material may be suspended in a solvent and excess of a Group IVA transition metal benzyl added. The amount of toluene produced is measured and related to the weight of support material.A second sample of the support material is then taken and a Group IA, IIA or IIB metal hydrocarbyl is added, followed by a Group IVA transition metal hydrocarbyl. It is also possible to add an excess of the transition metal organometallic compound after adding less than a complete titre of the Group IA, IIA or IIB organometallic compound, but when excess is used, it will remain in the reaction medium when the composition is separated. The compositIons defined above can be used as initiators for the polymerisation of olefinically unsaturated monomers. In this specification we intend the term polymerisation to mean the formation of high molecular weight polymers and we also intend the term to exclude oligomerisation to low molecular weight materials. According to a second aspect of the present invention olefinically unsaturated monomers are polymerised by means of an initiator which comprises a transition metal composition which is the product of reacting a particulate support material, preferably having a reactive surface as hereinbefore defined which is free from water with firstly an organometallic compound of the general formulaEMI9.1 and secondly a transition metal organometallic compound of the general formulaEMI9.2 wherein M is a metal of Groups IA, IIA or IIB of thePeriodic Table, T is a transition metal of Group IVA of the Periodic Table and R1 and R2 are hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl groups as hereinbefore defined,X, when present, is a singly charged anionic ligand or a monodentate ligand, m is 1 or 2, depending on whether the metal is in Group IA, or in Group IIA or IIB, and p is 0, 1 or 2. The term olefinically unsaturated monomer is intended to include mono olefins such as ethylene, propylene and 4 methylpentene l. Our compositions may also be used to initiate the copolymerisation of two or more olefinically unsaturated monomers. For example, ethylene may be copolymerised with propylene, butene, hexene or decene, butadiene or styrene. Polymerisation processes according to our invention may be carried out by techniques generally used for free radical initiated polymerisation or for polymerisation processes of the type using Ziegler catalysts. The choice of conditions of pressure and temperature will vary with factors such as the nature of the monomer and initiator, and whether liquid, e.g. bulk or diluent, or gas phase polymerisation is used. For example, when ethylene is polymerised, pressures from sub atmospheric to several thousand atmospheres may be used. Low pressure say from 0.1 to 30 atomospheres and intermediate pressure say from 30 to 300 atmospheres polymerisations may be carried out using conventional equipment but very high pressure polymerisation must be performed using suitable specialised reactors and pumping equipment. However, since, generally speaking, the higher the pressure the higher the activity, the use of such techniques may be justified. If very high pressures are used, it is preferred that conditions are such that the ethylene feed and polyethylene produced are maintained in a single fluid phase, i.e. the pressure should exceed 500 Kg cm2, preferably 1000 to 3000 Kg cm2, and the temperature should be greater than 1250C, say 140 3000C.This type of process is usually operated in a continuous manner. A wide range of temperatures may be used, but in general low and intermediate pressure ethylene polymerisations are carried out at temperatures in the range 50 160 C. When the process of our invention is used to polymerise propylene, it is preferred to operate under conditions commonly used for the polymerisation of propylene. However, polymerisation of propylene under other conditions e.g. high pressure, is not excluded. It is also within the scope of our invention to use our compositions to initiate the copolymerisation of ethylene and propylene together and or with other olefinically unsaturated monomers. The polymerisation process of the present invention may be carried out in the liquid or gaseous phase i.e. in the essential absence of a liquid medium and preferably in the gaseous phase. Where polymerisation is effected in the liquid phase, and the monomer is not liquid under the polymerisation conditions, the monomer may be dissolved in a suitable solvent. Examples of suitable solvents are aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons for instance pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene and mixtures thereof. Polymerisation may be effected either in a batch manner or a continuous basis. Preferably, however, the polymerisation process of the present invention is effected as a continuous gas phase process such as a fluid bed process. A fluid bed reactor for use in the process of the present invention typically comprises a reaction zone and a so called velocity reduction zone.The reaction zone comprises a bed of growing polymer particles, formed polymer particles and a minor amount of initiator particles fluidised by the continuous flow of the gaseous monomer, and gaseous diluent to remove heat of polymerisation through the reaction zone. A suitable rate of gas flow may be readily determined by simple experiment. Make up of gaseous monomer to the circulating gas stream is at a rate equal to the rate at which particulate polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and the composition of the gas passing through the reactor is adjusted to maintain an essentially steady state gaseous composition within the reaction zone. The gas leaving the reaction zone is passed to the velocity reduction zone where entrained particles are removed. Finer entrained particles and dust may be removed in a cyclone and or fine filter. The said gas is compressed in a compressor and passed through a heat exchanger wherein it is stripped of the heat of polymerisation and then returned to the reaction zone. Chain transfer agents may be used in a polymerisation process according to our invention, and when ethylene is polymerised their use is normally desirable as the polyethylene produced is of very high molecular weight. Hydrogen may be conveniently used in accordance with usual practice. However, some solvents may act as chain transfer agents. Our process is preferably effected under an atmosphere free of oxygen, for example under an atmosphere of an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen, or of the monomer to be polymerised. It is also preferred to effect the process using apparatus and solvents which have been carefully freed from impurities, such as oxygen, water and other substances which would otherwise react with the initiators. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples. In the examples hexane and iso octane were purified by passage through R3 ll copper catalyst and 5A molecular sieve and finally by sparging with pure nitrogen immediately before use. Ethylene and butene were purified by passage through R3 11 copper catalyst and 5A molecular sieve.Hydrogen was purified by passage through a catalytic deoxygenation unit and 5A molecular sieve. Melt FlowIndex MFI2.16 was measured under the conditions ofASTM D 1238, condition E at 190 C and reported as grams per 10 minutes.Polymerisation of EthyleneExample 1A particulate support material, KETJEN Registered Trade Mark Grade B alumina supplied by Koninklijke Zwavelzurfabrieken v h Ketjen NV was dried and converted to the gamma phase by heating at 5O00C for 2 hours under a flow of dry nitrogen. 13.68 g of the alumina was slurried in 187 ml toluene in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. 8.3 ml of a 1.65 M solution of n butyl lithium in hexane was added dropwise to the slurry of alumina with vigorous stirring over a period of 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour. 10 ml of a 0.0684 M solution of tetrabenzylzirconium solution in toluene was then added dropwise to the resultant slurry with vigorous stirring over 10 minutes, and the reaction mixture was stirred for a further hour. The slurry was allowed to settle and 137 ml of solution removed to give a slurry concentration of 5 ml g alumina 1. The catalyst thus obtained con tained 1.0 mA.g milliatom per gram alumina of lithium and 0.05 mA.g 1 of zirconium. The polymerisation of ethylene was carried out as follows. A commercial hydrogenator Hydrogenation ControlUnit from Electrosound Supplies Ltd was adapted to deliver ethylene to a 500 ml vessel containing 200 ml iso octane at 8O0C. The vessel was stirred with a VIBRO MIXER El supplied by ORME Scientific Ltd . 0.2 ml of the catalyst slurry was injected through a septum cap. The activity over the first hour was found to be 514g polyethylene milliatom zirconium transition metal 1bar1hr1. The results are set out inTable 1.

The catalyst was injected as a slurry containing 0.13 mA of zirconium into the aforesaid polymerisation apparatus to give 8.98 g of polypropylene after 2 hours, corresponding to an activity of 37.42 g mA bar l hr1 over 2 hours.Comparative Example JThe general procedure of Example 11 was repeated except that only tetrabenzylzirconium was added to the y alumina catalyst. The quantities of reagents used to prepare the catalyst were as follows 15.2 g y alumina 266 ml toluene 38 ml tetrabenzylzirconium 0.2 m solution in toluene The catalyst contained 0.5 mA.g l zirconium The catalyst was injected as a slurry containing 0.13 mA of zirconium into the polymerisation apparatus to give 1.58 g of polypropylene after 2 hours, corresponding to an activity of 7.2 gmA 1 bar l hr 1 over 2 hours, thereby illustrating the lower activity obtained as compared with the activity in Example 11.Copolymerisation of Ethylene and Butene lExample 12The catalyst containing 0.50 mA.g lmagnesium and 0.10 mA.g 1 zirconium was prepared as described in Example 6. The polymerisation procedure was as follows A one US gallon stainless steel pressure vessel was prepared by heating it to 100C and evacuating with an efficient vacuum pump. The vessel was cooled to 60 0C and 2 litres of purified hexane added. The vessel was then sparged at reaction pressure with about 2001 of pure ethylene over a period of 30 minutes to remove any residual moisture and oxygen, after which it was vented and iniator was injected as a slurry containing 0.05 mA of zirconium against a stream of ethylene. The vessel was then sealed and pressurised with 200 l hr ethylene, 50 l hr hydrogen and 160 ml hr butene l. When full reaction pressure 3 kg cm2g was reached the vessel was stirred at 1000 rpm and polymerisation commenced.Reaction was allowed to continue for 2 hours at 80 C, excess gases being held from the vessel through a pressure control valve and gas meter so that the reaction rate could be followed, after which the gas supplies were stopped and the vessel cooled and vented. The copolymer slurry was removed from the autoclave and to this was added 1 litre of de ionised water and 0.02 wt vol of sodium di ethylhexyl sulphosuccinate Aerosol OT calculated on polymer slurry, i.e. diluent, as a wetting agent. Steam at 1000C was then passed into the stirred vessel at about 25 g per minute and the mixture distilled at a temperature of about 600C, distillation being continued until no more organic material separated from the distillate. The copolymer product, which was granular in form, was then filtered from the aqueous slurry remaining in the distillation vessel, washed with water and dried under vacuum at approximately 60 C. 330 g of copolymer product, containing 2.3 molar per cent of butene l, were obtained. The melt flow index M.F.I. of the copolymer was 1.44 as measured by the method of ASTM 1238 62T using a 2.16 kg weight at 1900C. The mole comonomer incorporation was obtained from the IR analysis of the total methyl group count of the copolymer. The total methyl count, i.e. both methyl groups which are at ends of molecules and those which are at ends of side branches, was measured using a mathematical comparison, by computer, of the absorbance curve from 13101430 cm1 with two standard polyethylenes of known methyl count. A correction was then made for those methyl groups which are ends of molecules by subtracting the methyl count of a linear polyethylene prepared using the same catalyst and having a similar MFI. The corrected methyl count was then taken to be the side group content and expressed as mole co monomer incorporation. Comparative Example KThe polymerisation procedure described in Example 12 was repeated using the catalyst containing 0.10 mA.g lzirconium prepared as described in Comparative Example F 27 g of copolymer product, containing 2.7 molar per cent of butene l was obtained. The melt flow index M.F.I. of the copolymer was 0.008. This example illustrates the lower activity obtained as compared with the activity obtained in Example 12.Comparative Example LThe procedure of Example 12 was repeated using the following quantity of reagents to prepare the catalyst.7.96 g y alumina 106 g toluene 3.21 ml dibutyl magnesium 0.62 M solution in Isopar E 9.95 ml impure tetrabenzylzirconium 0.2 M in zirconium, solution in toluene prepared as described below.0.22 ml benzyl magnesium chloride 0.90 M solution in diethyl ether was evaporated to dryness and tetrabenzyl zirconium 0.2 M solution in toluene added. The magnesium dissolved on shaking to give a solution 0.2 M in zirconium and 0.02 M in magnesium. The catalyst contained 0.28 mA. 1 magnesium 0.25 mA.g 1 zirconium. The polymerisation procedure described inExample 12 was used with 0.2 mA zirconium 200 l hr ethylene 200 l hr hydrogen 200 ml hr liquid butene 5 kg cm2g full reactor pressure 148 g of copolymer product, containing 0.19 molar per cent of butene l was obtained. The M.F.I. was 0.026.This Example illustrates the lower activity obtained when using an impure transition metal component as compared with Example 12. It also illustrates the desirability of using a transition metal component of high purity as described in the aforementioned British PatentNo 1,47.5,184. What we claim is
