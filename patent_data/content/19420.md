# Cycle gear crank.

## Abstract
A gear crank for a cycle comprising a crank shaft 1 , a pair of crank arms 6 supported at opposite ends of said crank shaft 1 , a chain wheel support means 11 mounted in proximity to one end of the crank shaft 1 , said ends of said crank shaft 1 having support means 5 with generally circular outer peripheries for mounting of said crank arms 6 , said crank arms having elongate arm bodies 62 with bosses 60 at one end, said bosses having generally circular bores 61 for fitting onto said crank shaft support means 5 , and coupling means for holding said crank arm bores 61 and support means 5 against relative rotation therebetween. In order to permit adjustment of the effective length of the crank arms 6 the central axes O₁ of the support means 5, 30 around which the generally circular peripheries of said suport means 5, 30 extend are spaced from the rotational axis O₂ of the crank shaft 1 about which said crank shaft 1 rotates in use of the gear crank, and that said coupling means 8, 9 are formed and arranged for holding said crank arms 6 on said crank shaft in any one of a plurality of different predetermined angular dispositions, so as to provide a plurality of different spacings L₁,L₂ between the distal end of the crank arms 6 and the rotational axis O₂ of the crank shaft 1 .
