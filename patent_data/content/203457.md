# Fluoroelastomer composition and heat shrinkable articles comprising same.

## Abstract
A fluoroelastomer composition is disclosed, which com prises a mixture of 100 parts by weight of a tetrafluoroethy lene propylene copolymer, not smaller than 1 part by weight and smaller than 100 parts by weight of a vinylidene fluoride fluoroolefin copolymer having a fluoroolefin content of 1 to 20 mol , and a cross linking agent, said mixture being cross linked by irradiation with electron beams. The fluoro elastomer composition has a high mechanical strenght and im proved low temperature characteristics. When the content of the vinylidene fluoride fluoroolefin copolymer is not smaller than 10 parts by weight and smaller than 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the tetrafluoroethylene propylene copolymer the fluoroelastomer composition is suitable as a material for producing heat shrinkable tubes.
