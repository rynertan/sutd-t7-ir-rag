## Description
ANT I PLAQUE DENTURE CLEANSING TABLET Field of the Invention This invention relates to a two phase denture cleansing tablet possessing anti plaque activity as well as good cleansing, bleaching, disinfecting and antibacterial properties. Background of the Invention Known compositions for cleaning dentures are generally of two types a. alkaline compositions containing an oxidising agent which is effective in bleaching the stains and films which form on dentures but which do not readily dissolve tartar deposits b. acidic compositions which are effective in removing tartar deposits but which, if not properly rinsed, tend to leave an acidic after taste on the dentures and may cause corrosion in exposed metallic parts. It has also been proposed, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,997,459 of K. Bogie et al to provide a solid denture cleaning composition comprising a tartar dissolving amount of an acidic component which dis solves to provide an acidic solution when the compo sition is mixed with water and a neutralizing compo sition is mixed with water and a neutralizing co nent having a protective coating, in an amount such that, when the composition is mixed with water the protective coating is so affected that the neutralizing component is released over a period of time to adjust the initially acidic solution to a pH of more than 5.5. Also in German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,357,720 and U.S. Patent 4,256,599 of Werner Krisp et al there are disclosed two layered denture cleansing tablets with different dissolution rates for improved cleaning of dentures. Each layer of such tablets provides a pH in solution upon dissolution of the layers of about 6.5 to 7.0. While each of the above mentioned denture cleansing tablets provides denture cleansing properties sufficient for the cleansing of dentures, none of said tablets provides anti plaque properties nor has there been any denture cleansing tablet made available with anti plaque activity. It has also been known that cetylpyridinium chloride has anti plaque activity in mouthwash compositions, such as for example, as disclosed by A.R.Volpe et al., J. Dental Research, 48, 832 841 1969 J.K. Lem et al., Caries Research, 440 442 1982 andJ.D. Holbecke et al., Australian Dental Journal, 23 4 , 328 331, August 1978. Although cetylpyridinium chloride was found to possess anti plaque activi ty in mouthwashes attempts to obtain anti plaque activity for cetylpyridinium chloride in solid foras, such as lozenges, have not been successful. For example, G.P. Barnes et al, J.Preventive Dentistry, 2 5 2 4, 6 Sept. Oct., 1975 reported that neither the use of one cetylpyridinium chloride lozenge nor the use of three such lozenges per day resulted in a significant change in clinical plaque scores and that the different dosage levels of cetylpyridinium chloride used in the study were equally ineffective in reducing existing plaque accumulations and in inhibiting new plaque formation. Thus it has not heretofore been considered possible to obtain the antiplaque properties of cetylpyridinium chloride in solid dosage form and particularly in a denture cleansing tablet. It is therefore highly desirable that a denture cleansing composition be provided such that a denture cleansing tablet possessing anti plaque activity as well as good cleansing, bleaching, disinfecting and antibacterial activity be provided. Attempts to do so before applicants invention have not proved successful. Summary of the Invention It has now been discovered that a denture cleansing tablet possessing good anti plaque activity as well as good cleansing, bleaching, disinfecting and antibacterial activity can be obtained by providing a two layered denture cleansing tablet having a first, fast dissolution, alkaline layer providing in solution Q pH of about 9 and a second, slower dissolution, acid layer containing a quaternary ammonium anti plaque compound such as cetylpyridinium chloride as an anti plaque agent and providing a pH of about 3.0 0.5.With such a two phase tablet the first phase cleanses and disinfects under alkaline conditions for a period of up to about two minutes and the second phase cleanses under acidic conditions and removes some calcified deposits tartar on the dentures as well as further disinfecting and coating the dentures with an anti plaque effective amount of the anti plaque agent cetylpyridinum chloride. Generally the total dissolution time for the two layers would preferably be less than about nine minutes. Detailed Description of the Invention A two phase tablet is provided which in use produces a cleansing solution initially producing a pH of about 9.0 and which then swings to a pH of about 3.owt 0.5 upon dissolution of the second, acid layer of the tablet. The denture cleansing tablet producing such a pH swing is provided by a twolayered tablet having different dissolution rates for the two layers which is accomplished by the selection of ingredients in each layer and by adjustment of the hardness of the tablet to a hardness of between about 6 and 10 kp 58.86 and 98.1 N . The composition of the first, faster dissolution, alkaline layer of a tablet of the invention comprises on a dry weight basis, based on 100 weight percent total dry weight first layer, from about 10 to about 25 sodium bicarbonate, about 4 to about 15 sodium tripolyphosphate, about 5 to about 40 sodium perborate and about 10 to about 50 potassium monoper sulphate. The composition of the second, slower dissolution, acid layer of a tablet of this invention comprises on a dry weight basis, based on 100 weight percent total dry weight second layer, from about 10 to about 60 sulphamic acid, about 10 to about 90 potassium monopersulphate and or citric acid, and up to about 10 quaternary ammonium anti plaque compound such as cetylpyridinium chloride.A mixture of potassium monopersulphate or citric acid may also be used including other acids such as biulphate, Such tablets are useful for the self acting cleansing of dentures in an aqueous medium whereby the dentures are cleaned, bleached and disinfected at a pH of about 9 from the alkaline layer and upon dissolution of the second acid layer the pH of the solution swings to about 3.0 and tartar is removed and cetylpyridinium chloride is deposited on the dentures and this deposition inhibits build up of plaque on the dentures. The monopersulphate employed in the invention is preferably a 50 active form known as Caroat commat and sold by E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co. and is a 2 1 1 mixture of monopersulphate, potassium sulphate and potassium bisulphate. This mixture has an active oxygen content of approximately 4.5 . The first, faster dissolution alkaline layer evidences maximum decomposition at about pH 9, that is, a decomposition reaction of the monopersulphate and perborate ingredients to give off active oxygen to bleach and disinfect the dentures as well as providing a cleansing action. This decomposition reaction stops when pH of the solution is acidic. At this high pH the perborate is most active by providing a hydrogen peroxide source active oxygen for bleaching and disinfecting the dentures. The sodium tripolyphosphate component is a water softener sequestering agent as well as a detergent which dissolves rapidly and removes loose plaque and food debris from the dentures. The sodium bicarbonate component is present to react with the potassium bisulphate which is present in the commercial grade of potassium monopersulphate to improve effervescence due to carbon dioxide pro duction and hence increase the rate of dissolution of the layer. Sodium carbonate may optionally be present in the composition in an amount of from 0 to about 15 dry weight basis. The sodium bicarbonate and sodium tripolyphosphate ingredients are responsible for giving the high alkaline pH during the two minute dissolution of the alkaline layer. Too much phosphate and carbonate with a corresponding decrease in the bicarbonate content would give an unacceptably high pH.The rate of effervescence and dissolution would decrees , particularly if levels of perborate and monopersulphate are reduced as well to accomodate the increase in the alkaline ingredients. The presence of sodium carbonate also is useful in improving the stability of the product. If the bicarbonate content is increased significantly so as to improve the tabletting properties at the expense of carbonate and tripolyphosphate which are more difficult to tablet then the pH swing and final pH would be dramatically affected, for example, pH will not rise to 8 or 9 and the final pH would be significantly lower than the desired pH of 3.owt 0.5. Of course other optional ingredients can be present in the first, alkaline layer provided the ingredients are not detrimental to the overall activity of the two phase tablet and do not materially affect the required pH swing of from about 9 to about 3.owt 0.5. For example, a complexing agent for a softening and demineralizing effect as well as a tartar dissolving effect and detergency action can be employed. Any suitable complexing agent, such as for example, an ethylene diamine tetraacetate, such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid or its sodium salts, can be employed. Such an agent also improves the stability of any dye or colorant present but since it has poor tabletting properties its concentration is kept to a minimum, for example, from about o to about 5 dry weight basis, preferably about 3 . Binding agents to stop lamination and or capping of the tablet may be employed, such as for example, powdered nonionic surfactants, such as polyethanoxy alkyl ether sold as EMPILAN Q s50 and the like, or anionic surfactants such as dodecylbenzene sulphate, sodium lauryl sulphate or the like. The agents also improve the foaming properties and the dispersion of any precipitate formed in the solution. Selection of these ingredients, which are also detergents, must consider their effect on sticking on tablet punches and on the hardness of the tablet which could increase causing a decrease in the rate of dissolution.The amount of such agents will generally be from about 0 to about 5 dry weight basis, preferably about 1 . Especially preferred for use in this connection is ricinylmonoethanolamide sulphosuccinate disodium salt sold under the trademark REWO DERMS1333 from the firm REWO, Federal Republic of Germany and a mixture of hardened triglycerides material being available in the Federal Republic of Germany under the trademark BOESON commat VP 60. Polyethylene gly col, such as for example, PEG 20,000 may also be employed. Generally up to about 3 dry weight basis of the sulfosuccinate and up to about 5 hardened triglyceride may be employed, preferably about 1 of each. Flavoring agents such as peppermint or other aromatics may be added in an amount of from 0 to about 1.5 , preferably about 0.3 . While any suitable dye or colorant could be added, it is preferred that the alkaline layer be white and that a suitable dye or colorant be employed in the acid layer to evidence the dissolution of the acid layer and the pH swing of the cleansing solution. The second, slower dissolution, acid layer generally dissolves in about 6 to about 8 minutes and this phase interacts with the alkaline phase to give a final solution pH of about 3.0 0.5. This is important since it has been found that deposition of cetylpyridinium chloride and hence antiplaque activity is maximized under acidic conditions. Moreover, any significant increase in the final pH will also decrease the removal of calcium deposit and any acid cleansing properties. In the second acid layer sulphamic acid and potassium monopersulphate Caroat R are the main in gredients used to achieve the low pH required for acid cleansing and deposition of cetylpyridinium chloride onto the dentures. Additionally it is possible to employ some sodium bisulphate for this acid lowering function since it is easier to tablet than sulphamic acid. However, sodium bisulphate is notorious for its corrosive and hygroscopic properties. Moreover, increasing the sodium bisulphate content to improve the tabletting properties decreases the stability of the acid layer. Thus sodium bisulphate can be employed in the acid layer in an amount of from about 0 to about 20 , preferably about 5 , on a dry weight basis, along with sulphamic acid. The potassium monopersulphate present in the acid phase provides bleaching and antibacterial properties, maintains acidity and acts as a tabletting aid. In addition to its anti plaque activity cetylpyridinium chloride also has antibacterial properties in the tablet of this invention. Although the perferred quaternary ammonium antiplaque compound is cetyl pyridinium chloride, other such quaternary compounds can be employed in the tablets of this invention, such as for example, the following exemplary quaternary compounds tetradecyl trimethylammonium bromide 1 hexadecyl pyridinium chloride benzyl dimethyl 2 2 f4 1,1 ,3,3 tetra methyl butyl phenoxylethoxy ethy1 ammonium chloride a mixture of alkyl benzyl dimethylammonium chlorides dodecyl dimethyl 2 phenoxyethyl ammonium bromide 1, 1 decamethylene bis 4 amino 2 methyl quinolinium chloride dimethyl tetradecyl benzyl ammonium chloride and the like. Other optional or desirable ingredients may also be added to the second acid layer provided they are not detrimental to the overall activity of the twophase tablet and do not materially affect the required pH swing of from about 9 to about 3.0 0.5.For example, as in the first layer, a complexing agent for a softening and demineralizing efect as well as a tartar dissolving effect and detergency action can be employed. The same suitable complexing agents as in the alkaline layer may be employed, preferably the tetrasodium salts of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, in an amount of from about 0 to about 10 , dry weight basis, preferably about 2 . As with the alkaline layer, sodium carbonate in an amount of from about 0 to about 10 , preferably about 2 , dry weight basis can be employed for the same general reasons as employed in the alkaline phase. However, the amount of carbonate in the acid layer is low so as to reduce the rate of effervescence and hence dissolution of this layer. Disodium pyrophosphate employed in the acid phase has softening and cleansing properties similar to the tripolyphosphate in the alkaline phase. Raising or lowering the amount of the ingredient does not affect the pH profile because of its neutral pH and it is therefore employed as an excipient for adjusting the formulation in an amount of from about 0 to about 15 dry weight basis. A further preferred embodiment of the inventive cleansing tablet is distinguished by virtue of the fact that the second layer contains about 0.1 to about 38, preferably about 0.5 , by weight on a dry weight basis, silicone dioxide which has been manufactured by means of the pyrolysis of silicon tetrachloride in an oxyhydrogen flame. It is through this silicone dioxide which is available commercially under the trade name Aerosil commat r that an effective protection of the composition of the second layer against hygroscopicity is achieved. The silicone dioxide has lubricating properties and maintains the free flowing properties of the powder. Binding agents to stop lamination and or capping of the tablet may be employed, such as, for example, powdered nonionic surfactants such as, polyethanoxy alkyl ether, sold as EMPILAN R3 450, and the like or anionic surfactants such as dodecylbenzene sulphate, sodium lauryl sulphate or the like. The agents also improve the foaming properties and the dispersion of any precipitate formed in the solution. Selection of these ingredients, which are also detergents, must consider their effect on sticking on tablet punches and on the hardness of the tablet which could increase causing a decrease in the rate of dissolution.The amount of such agents will generally be from about 0 to about 5 dry weight basis, preferably about 1 . Especially preferred for use in this connection is ricinylmonoethanolamide. sulphosuccinate disodium salt sold under the trademarkREWO DERM S1333 from the firm REWO, Federal Republic of Germany and a mixture of hardened triglycerides material being available in the Federal Republic of Germany under the trademark BOESON R VP 60. Polyethylene gly col, such as for example, PEG 20,000 may also be employed. Generally up to about 3 and preferably about 0.5 , dry weight basis, of the sulfosuccinate acid up to about 5 and preferably about 3 , hardened triglyceride may be employed.However, it is important that the amounts of these ingredients be carefully controlled because the acid layer has a tendency to stick on the tablet punches because of the nature of the sulphamic acid and sodium bisulphate. It is also desirable to employ an anti dusting agent to reduce the dust which develops during the manufacture of the bulk powder and during tabletting.An amount of antidusting agent up to about 1 , preferably about 0.1 to about 1 and most preferably about 0.4 by weight. A suitable anti dusting agent is, for example, light liquid paraffin. However, too high a level of such agent causes a darkening of the color, poor flow properties and reduces binding hence softening tablets with possible capping. The rate of effervescence and dissolution of the acid layer can also be reduced by the incorporation of magnesium stearate in an amount up to about 1 , dry weight basis, generally about 0.1 to 1 , preferably about 0.38. The magnesium stearate also acts as a lubricating agent to reduce the sticking of the acid layer. Flavoring agents such as peppermint or other aromatics may be added in an amount of from 0 to about 1.5 , preferably about 0.2 . While any suitable dye or colorant could be added in the acid layer it is necessary that a stable dye be employed because of the high level of bleaching agents present in the cleansing solution. The acid layer can, for example, be a green color and this can be accomplished by employing Blue No. 1 Lake and Yellow Tartrazine Lake, for example, in an amount of about 0.15 Blue Lake and 0.2 yellow dye. When different colorings of the two layers is employed whereby for example the first layer is white, and the second layer green, it is possible to optically follow the chronological succession of the two cleansing stages.When a tablet of this type is placed in a glass, or the like, filled with water as a cleansing bath, one can observe that, at the beginning of a cleansing operation, only the first, for example, white layer dissolves rapidly in the cleansing bath with an accompanying turbulent gas formation without the water being colored thereby. There subsequently follows the dissolution of the second, for example, green layer, connected with a strong but not turbulent gas formation. The onset of the second cleansing stage is indicated by a clearly evident coloring or tinting of the cleansing bath brought about by the dye additive. Generally the alkaline layer of the two phase tablet will comprise about 36 of the total weight and the acid layer about 64 although this may vary within the scope of the invention. A suitable tablet may, for example, comprises an alkaline layer of about 1.4 grams and an acid layer of about 2.5 grams.

Subjects The panel was comprised of 6 senior citizens all of whom had a full set of acrylic dentures. The age of the dentures varied from 2 years to 30 years. They were given no special instructions on treatment of their dentures prior to the trial.2. Product Cetylpyridinium chloride tablet of this inven tion as described above.3. Test Regime The top sets of dentures were rinsed with water and then vigorously brushed for 5 minutes with commercial cleanser containing a solution of 6 hydrochloric acid. The dentures were then rinsed with water and disclosed with 5 erythro sine for 10 sec. Excess dye was rinsed off and the plaque coverage was assessed by 4 indepen dent observers. After assessment, the dentures were photographed, using Barfen commat CR100 slide film, on the top fitting surface and on both sides, under controlled lighting conditions. The objective of this treatment was to obtain a baseline measurement of plaque density, as close to zero as possible, against which the effectiveness of subsequent treatments in preventing plaque build up could be measured.Residual traces of erythrosine were removed from the dentures by brushing with a 50 50 mixture of sodium lauryl sulphate and sodium perborate.This vigorous treatment was necessary, since the residual plaque stained strongly and the dye proved difficult to remove. After the dye was removed, the dentures were cleansed with the cetylpyridinium chloride CPC tablet in pots containing 150 ml of tap water at 37 C for 15 min. The CPC tablets were placed in the water with the white surface uppermost.The six subjects were given CPC tablets to use between visits. They were asked to clean their dentures every morning and were provided with pots for this purpose. They were also asked to avoid brushing their dentures and the use of any other cleansers. They were permitted to wear their dentures at night if they so desired, but if they chose to soak them, to u se only water. On day 5 the subjects returned and the plaque was assessed, as before, but this time without 6 hydrochlorid acid pre treatment.4. Assessment of Plaque Four observers assessed the plaque according to the area of denture covered, and assigned scores as follows 0 no plaque 1 light plaque 1 25 area covered 2 moderate plaque 26 50 area covered 3 heavy plaque 51 75 area covered 4 very heavy plaque 76. 100 area covered They were asked to visually bisect the top fitting surface of the dentures, horizontally and vertically, and to score the 4 areas separ ately. Similarly, they bisected each side of the dentures, giving 8 separate areas in total. Thus, the maximum possible score for each den ture was 32. RESULTS Table 1 Total Plaque Scores Sum of ScorreXs from 4 Assessors Subject Baseline Treated Diff. 3 53 44 9 4 44 57 13 6 31 29 2 9 61 38 23 11 42 53 11 12 35 41 6Total 266 262 4Table 1 shows the combined plaque scores of all 4 assessors for each subject. Since the dentures were cleansed with 6 hydrochloric acid solution on the first visit, and only disclosed on the second visit, we would expect to see an increase in the plaque score over the 4 day treatment period. This should give a measure of the build up of soft plaque and thus a comparison of the inhibiting effect of these formulations.In the case of the CPC tablet, the build up of plaque was suppressed, with some subjects actually showing a decrease in plaque index when compared with baseline scores. the overall plaque index was similar afterCPC tablet treatment, to the baseline figures. The results show that the CPC containing tablet of this invention is an effective anti plaque agent.
