# Roll fuser apparatus.

## Abstract
Heat and pressure fusing apparatus 38 for fixing toner images to copy substrates comprising a first fusing system 61 consisting of a pair of nip forming rolls 64, 72 , one of which 64 is provided with a conformable outer surface 70 and a second fusing system 62 con sisting of a pair of nip forming rolls 78, 84 , one of which 78 has a rigid outer surface. Copy substrates 34 are passed sequentially through the nips 74, 90 of the first and second fusing systems 61, 62 , in that order, such that the toner images sequentially contact the conformable outer surface and then the rigid outer surface.
