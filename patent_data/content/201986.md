# INTERMODULATION SUPPRESSING CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An intermodulation suppressing circuit is to be con nected in the input stage of a frequency processing circuit 1a, 1b using non linear elements. It is designed to allow the passage therethrough of beat wave signals fb produced as a result of intermodulation of the wanted signal fl with an interference signal fn whose frequency is different from the frequency of the wanted signal, thereby reducing the intermodulation effect on the frequency processing circuit.
