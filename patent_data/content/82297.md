# Dot matrix character printing using constrained memory.

## Abstract
In a wire matrix printer control system, some characters from a finite alphabet are locally stored as compressed dot matrix objects reflectively symmetric about at least one axis. Upon being referenced and ascertained as a compressed object, the bits are applied to the printhead in column major order up to the axis of symmetry and then applied in reverse column major order. For uncompressed objects, the bits are applied only in column major order.
