# Surface acoustic wave transducer.

## Abstract
A single phase unidirectional surface acoustic wave transducer comprising a piezoelectric substrate and a trans ducer having localized symmetry and constructed for estab lishing a predetermined separation between the centers of acoustic wave reflection and transduction on said substrate by selectively orienting the transducer on a specific cut of said substrate to achieve a separation between said centers in a continuum of achievable phase angles of 0 360 .
