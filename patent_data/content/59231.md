## Description
PREPARATION OF ALKENYL AROMATIC MONOMER BUTADIENE RUBBER AND PREPARATION OF IMPACT RESISTANT RESIN THEREFROM Solution polymerized butadiene polymers such as polybutadiene, styrene butadiene polymer and like rubbery butadiene polymers prepa red with a lithium based catalyst have been recognized as having highly desirable physical properties for a number of applications. The polymerization of butadiene polymers with lithium based catalyst is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,317,918. One end use for such butadiene polymer is in the reinforcement of styrene polymers and the preparation of impact resistant rubber reinforced molding and extrusion compositions as described in U.S . Patents 3,264,374 and 3,976,721. Such butadiene polymers have been prepared by a variety of methods However, for many purposes the lithium based catalyst provides a preferred product.The block polymerization of 1,3 butadiene is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,970,607 which employs a 1,2 diene as a reaction regulator to prevent excessive exotherm during polymerization. Often such lithium initiated or solution polymerized rubbery butadiene polymers are available in the form of a solidlike rubbery mass or an extremely viscous liquid. In the preparation of a rubber reinforced alkenyl aromatic polymer such as polystyrene, they are dissolved in the styrene monomer and the resultant rubber solution, with or without diluent, is subsequently polymerized either by mass polymerization technique or mass suspension polymerization technique to give the desired impact resistant styrene polymer.The preparation of the alkenyl aromatic monomer rubber solution requires substantial equipment, labor and elapsed time to obtain a uniform solution of rubber in monomer. The monomer rubber solution is often filtered and subsequently subjected to polymerization conditions. It would be desirable if there were available an improved method for the preparation of rubbery butadiene polymer, particularly as a solution using alkenyl aromatic monomer as solvent to avoid handling of undissolved rubber. These advantages are achieved in a process for the preparation of an alkenyl aromatic butadiene rubbery polymer, comprising 1 providing a solution comprising 80 to 30 parts by weight of alkenyl aromatic monomer, 20 to 70 parts by weight of butadiene advantageously from 75 to 35 parts by weight alkenyl aromatic monomer and 30 to 60 parts by weight butadiene and up to 50 weight percent based on the total weight of the solution of a solvent which is generally inert under conditions of polymerization, 2 initiating polymerization with a lithium based polymerization initiator until about 5 to about 30 weight percent of the combined weight of alkenyl aromatic monomer and butadiene has been converted to form a rubbery alkenyl aromatic monomer butadiene polymer, and 3 terminating the polymerization and separating unreacted butadiene therefrom.Advantageously, the process includes the further steps of 4 subsequently initiating polymerization to induce polymerization of alkenyl aromatic monomer, or alkenyl aromatic monomer with a comonomer such as acrylonitrile, until the desired quantity of the alkenyl aromatic monomer, or alkenyl aromatic monomer and comonomer has been converted to alkenyl aromatic polymer, and then 5 isolating from the reaction mixture an alkenyl aromatic polymer reinforced with a rubbery alkenyl aromatic monomer butadiene polymer. By the term 11alkenyl aromatic monomer is meant an alkenyl aromatic compound having the formulaEMI3.1 R2 R4 R3 wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl and R2, R3, R4 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl radicals containing up to 10 carbon atoms with the further limitation that the total number of carbon atoms in R2, R3, and R4 is not greater than 10. Examples of such alkenyl aromatic monomers are styrene, vinyltoluene all isomers, the para isomer being preferred , a methylstyrene, para tertiary butyl styrene, 3,4 dimethylstyrene, 2 ethylhexylstyrene all isomers , n decylstyrene all isomers , and n butyl styrene. Butadiene and alkyl aromatic monomer used in the present invention should be generally free of active hydrogen compounds which would deactivate a lithium based catalyst. Lithium based catalysts suitable for the practice of the present invention are set forth at length in U.S. Patent 3,317,918. Generally, from a standpoint of availability and convenience of handling, n butyllithium is preferred. Polymerization to form the rubbery alkenyl aromatic butadiene polymer of the present invention is advantageously conducted at a temperature between about 100C and 700C and preferably 300C to 500C. Desirably such polymerization is conducted in a vessel equipped with an agitator and a condenser which permits reflux of the butadiene as a heat transfer agent. On polymerization in accordance with the present invention, it is essential that only relatively low conversion of the butadiene to rubbery polymer be permitted. The kinetics of polymerization are such that if the major portion of the butadiene is polymerized, the polymer is no longer rubbery because of excessive alkenyl aromatic monomer content. Also, if the conversion of butadiene exceeds about 30 percent by weight of the butadiene, the possibility of thermal runaway, that is, uncontrolled rapid pozymerization of the alkenyl aromatic monomer becomes very great. As the conversion of butadiene to polymer increases, so does the percentage of alkenyl aromatic monomer in the polymer increase, and the rubbery characteristics desired for reinforcement are lost. Termination of the lithium induced polymerization is readily accomplished by the addition of compounds which will donate a proton. Typically terminating compounds include water, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, acetic acid, and propionic acid. Once the anionic polymerization has been terminated, unreacted butadiene is removed from the system, generally by distillation with or without reduced pressure. The butadiene is readily condensed and may be used again. Butadiene rubbers prepared in accordance with the present invention have molecular weights from about 30,000 to 700,000 grams per mole and contain about 1 to 40 weight percent alkenyl aromatic monomer copolymerized therein. Advantageously, the rubbers contain from about 2 to 25 weight percent alkenyl aromatic monomer and preferably from 5 to 15 weight percent styrene when being used for reinforcing a styrene polymer matrix such as polystyrene or styrene acrylonitrile copolymer. After the removal of the butadiene, free radical polymerization of the alkenyl aromatic monomer can be started either by the use of conventional free radical initiators such as peroxy compounds, azo compounds or combination of peroxy and azo compounds, or alternatively free radical polymerization can be initiated thermally. Generally, the free radical polymerization is conducted at a temperature of from about 600C to 1700C.Peroxy initiated free radical polymerization is generally conducted in the range of 60 C to 1700C while thermal initiation is generally employed in the temperature range of from about 1100C to 1700C. During at least the initial portion of the polymerization of alkenyl aromatic monomer, agitation is desirable to obtain the preferred impact resistant polymers. Suitable equipment for such polymerization is set forth in U.S. Patent 3,243,481. When polymerization of the alkenyl aromatic monomer has occurred to the desired degree, residual monomer is removed by heating the reaction mixture at about 1800C to 2500C under a pressure of from about 0.10 to 100 millimeters of mercury and exposing as much surface of the reaction mixture as possible in a devolatilizing chamber, and subsequently cooling the polymer.Such polymer is generally useful for extrusion and injection molding. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples Example 1 A one liter round bottom flask is equipped with a dry ice cooled reflux condenser and an agitator.The vessel is provided with a nitrogen atmosphere and charged with 318 grams of purified styrene and 170 grams of purified butadiene. The contents of the flask were at ambient temperature about 220C . The polymerization was initiated by the addition of 2 milliliters of a 0.523 normal solution of n butyllithium in hexane. The polymerization temperature in the flask varied from about 140C to 240C governed by the reflux rate of the butadiene. The polymerization was terminated 5 hours after the addition of the n butyllithium by the addition of about 0.2 milliliters of n propanol. The polymer was recovered by precipitation with methanol to yield 45.5 grams of a rubbery styrene butadiene polymer a yield of 9.3 weight percent based on weight of initial monomers. Gel permeation chromatography was employed to determine the molecular weight using both an ultraviolet and refractive index detectors. The molecular weight was 187,000 grams per mole and the polymer contained 14.9 weight percent styrene and 85.1 weight percent butadiene. Employing the reactivity ratios reported by Hsieh and Glaze Rubber Chem. Tech., 43, 22, 1970 , wherein the reactivity ratio for styrene was taken at 0.1 and that for butadiene as 12.5, the calculated composition was 14.5 percent styrene and 85.5 percent butadiene.Example 2 A. A two liter reactor with agitator was flushed with nitrogen and charged with 554 grams of.purified styrene and 677 grams of purified butadiene.Polymerization was initiated with 12.5 milliliters of 0.55 normal n butyllithium in hexane solution. The reaction mixture was heated to 450C with dry ice placed on the top of the reactor to condense butadiene vapors and maintain the temperature of the contents below 500C. One hour and 45 minutes after the addition of the n butyllithium, polymerization was terminated by addition of 5 milliliters of one normal ethylbenzene solution of n propanol. The reaction mixture was sampled and had a solids content of 21.6 weight percent. The molecular weight of the polymer determined using the apparatus ofExample 1 was 322,000 grams per mole and it contained 6.8 weight percent styrene, the remainder being butadiene. The reaction mixture was then admixed with 2 liters of styrene and the excess butadiene monomer removed by agitating the solution and applying vacuum to give 1123 grams of a mixture consisting of 84 grams of styrene butadiene rubber polymer and 1039 grams of styrene. B. This mixture was further diluted with an additional 228.5 grams of styrene. To this mixture was added 150 grams of ethylbenzene, 3.75 grams of mineral oil, 2.25 grams of stabilizer commercially available under the trade designation of Irganox 1076, 1.05 grams of alphamethylstyrene dimer and 3 grams of a 25 weight percent active solution of l,1 di tertiarybutylperoxy cyclohexane in ethylbenzene. Then 1200 grams of the mixture was added to an agitated batch polymerization reactor and the temperature was raised from 1100C to 1600C over a period of 7 hours. After 4 hours an additional 200 grams of the feed mixture was added. At the end of 7 hours heating was discontinued and the mixture containing 72.1 weight percent solids was poured into shallow pans and placed in a vacuum oven at about 2000C for 90 minutes. The devolatilized polymer was removed from the pans and ground to particulate form. Samples were subsequently compression molded for physical property determinations. The tensile strength at yield of the polymer was 2840 pounds per square inch 19.6 MPa tensile strength at break 2965 pounds per square inch 20.4 MPa with 28.1 percent elongation at break. The notched Izod impact strength was 1.4 foot pounds per inch 75 J m of notch and the Vicat heat distortion temperature was 2120F. These are typical properties for conventional impact resistant polystyrene of like rubber content. Example 3 A plurality of rubbers were prepared employing the general procedure of Example 1 wherein the styrene butadiene monomer ratio by weight was 65 35, using varying quantities of toluene as a diluent and initial temperature, n butyllithium concentration and polymerization time as stated.
