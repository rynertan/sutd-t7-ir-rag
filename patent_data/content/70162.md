# Continuous carbon filament fiber bundles.

## Abstract
A bundle of continuous carbon filament fibers is treated with a sizing agent containing as an active component a water dispersible resin composition consisting of about 65 to 95 by weight of a water dispersible urethane compound having at least one epoxy group and at least one quaternary ammonium group and about 5 to 35 by weight of an epoxy resin. The bundle has an excellent fretting resistance, is extremely handleable, and produces a carbon fiber reinforced composite material having excellent physical properties.
