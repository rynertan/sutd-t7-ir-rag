# Tobacco treatment.

## Abstract
A process for maximizing reduction of gas phase compo nents during combution of tobacco products is disclosed. The process comprises contacting tobacco material with an aque ous solution to form a tobacco extract. After separating the extract from the fibrous tobacco portion, the extract is treated to remove potassium nitrate by ion exchange, electrodialysis, crystallization techniques or the like. Thereafter, potassium ions in the form of a potassium salt other than potassium nitrate are restored to the potassium depleted tobacco and or extract to a level approximating that originally present in the tobacco prior to extraction.
