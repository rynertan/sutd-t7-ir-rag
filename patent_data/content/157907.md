# Drilling mud compositions.

## Abstract
Dispersants useful in aqueous drilling mud formulations employed in the drilling of subterranean wells where high temperature and high pressure environments are encoun tered are disclosed. The dispersants, when used in amounts of about 0.05 11.34 kg. per 159 1. 0.1 25 lb. per 42 gal. provide muds containing colloidal material suspended in an aqueous medium with improved high temperature and high pressure stability. The dispersants are water soluble sulfon ated vinyl toluene maleic anhydride copolymers which have a molar ratio of vinyl toluene to maleic anhydride of 1 1 to less than about 2 1, a molecular weight of 1,000 to 25,000 and at least about 0.7 sulfonic acid groups per vinyl toluene unit.
