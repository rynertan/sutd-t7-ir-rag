# Head depression type dispenser.

## Abstract
A head depression type dispenser 10 comprises a cylinder 26 formed of an elastic material such as rubber. The cylinder 26 is arranged between a head 16 and a cap 14 , and is constructed to operate as a piston for sucking and pressurizing liquid by means of axial deformation of the cylinder 26 upon movement of the head 16 . When the depressing force applied to its head 16 is removed after the cylinder 26 is deformed, the cylinder will return to the original shape by its own elasticity. In addition, a sealing 30 piece extends from the cylinder 26 into the passage 20 of the head 16 , thereby closely contacting the inner wall of the passage 20 to form a secondary valve. The sealing piece 30 becomes isolated from the inner wall of the passage 20 when the hydraulic pressure in the cylinder 26 exceeds the elasticity of the sealing piece 30 , allowing the flow of the compressed liquid through the passage 20 , and closely contacts the inner wall of the passage 20 by the elasticity of the sealing piece 30 when the hydraulic pressure becomes lower than the elasticity of the sealing piece.
