## Description
Background And Summary The invention relates to a junction field effect transistor JFET affording vertical bidirectional current flow. Gate structure is provided for eliminating the need to commutate a single gate between alternating polarity main terminals for bidirectional current control. A double gate structure enables a first gate to be dedicated and referenced to the first main terminal, and a second gate to be dedicated and referenced to the second main terminal. In preferred form, a first set of regions in a semiconductor body defines a first set of channels therebetween substantially coplanar along a first horizontal plane. A second set of regions defines a second set of channels therebetween substantially coplanar along a second horizontal plane vertically spaced from the first horizontal plane. The JFET has an ON state conducting bidirectional current vertically through the first and second sets of channels. The JFET has an OFF state blocking current flow through the channels due to horizontal depletion spreading pinch off. Brief Description Of The DrawingsPrior Art FIGS. 1 4 schematically illustrate aSchockley gridistor and the sequential processing steps therefor. FIGS. 5 8 schematically illustrate a static induction transistor SIT and sequential processing steps therefor. Present Invention FIG. 9 schematically illustrates a verticalJFET constructed in accordance with the invention. Description Of Prior Art FIG. 1 shows a Schockley gridistor 2 including a semiconductor body 4 of one conductivity type having a plurality of opposite conductivity type regions such as 6 defining a plurality of channels such as 8 therebetween. Schockley gridistor 2 has an ON state conducting bidirectional current vertically through channels 8 between first and second main terminals T1 and T2. Schockley gridistor 2 has an OFF state blocking current flow through channels 8 due to depletion region spreading from the junctions such as 10 and 12 between body 4 and regions 6. In the OFF state, the depletion regions from junctions 10 and 12 spread toward and meet each other as shown at dashed line 14 to thus pinch off channel 8 and block conduction. In the ON state, depletion region shrinking back toward the junctions, as shown at dashed lines 16 and 18, opens a conduction path of width 20 through channel 8, enabling current flow therethrough. Depletion region spreading from junctions 10 and 12 is controlled by the relative bias potential on gate G. Forward biasing of junctions 10 and 12 shrinks the depletion region back toward the junctions, whereas reversed biasing of junctions 10 and 12 spreads the depletion regions away from the junctions and toward each other to effect pinch off. Schockley gridistor 2 is either normally ON or normally OFF , depending on doping concentrations, which determine the extent of depletion region spreading in the absence of biasing gate potential. If gridistor 2 is normally OFF, then gate terminal G must be positively biased to forward bias junctions 10 and 12 and thus shrink the depletion regions and open a conductive channel as at 20.If gridistor 2 is normally ON, then gate terminal G must be negatively biased to reverse bias junctions 10 and 12 and thus spread the depletion regions and close or pinch off the conduction channel as at 14. In AC implementations, there is alternating polarity between main terminals T1 and T2, which in turn requires that the reference for the gate voltage be commutated between the alternating polarity main terminals T1 and T2. For example, for a normally OFF gridistor 2, when T1 is positive with respect to T2, the biasing potential for gate terminal G is referenced to T2 and made positive relative thereto to turn ON gridistor 2. During the other half cycle, when T2 is positive with respect to T1, the gate voltage is referenced to T1 and made positive relative thereto.The commutation of single gate G for a normally ON gridistor 2 is comparable, with the reference for single gate terminal G being commutated between and made negative relative to alternating polarity main terminals T1 and T2, to turn gridistor 2 OFF. The processing steps for gridistor 2 are sequentially illustrated in FIGS. 1 4. A semiconductor body 4, FIG. 2, of one conductivity type such as n type has an epitaxial layer 22 of opposite conductivity type such as p type grown thereon, followed by a masked etch to yield p regions 6, FIG. 3. FIG. 4 isometrically illustrates the front end of the structure of FIG. 3, with finger like p regions 6 joined at front end 24 for gate connection. An n deposition is then performed to yield the upper portion 26, FIG. 1, of the semiconductor body and the channels 8 between p regions 6. FIG. 5 schematically illustrates a static induction transistor SIT 30, also known as a stepped electrode transistor SET . N type semiconductor body 32 has a plurality of p type semiconductor regions 34 defining channels such as 36 therebetween. SIT 30 has an ON state conducting bidirectional current vertically through channels 36 between main terminals T1 and T2, and has an OFF state blocking current flow through the channels due to depletion region pinch off. Depletion region spreading is controlled by the biasing of junctions such as 38 and 40 between p regions 34 and body 32, as in gridistor 2. The reference for gate biasing potential for terminal G, FIG. 5. is commutated between T1 and T2 inAC applications. This is necessary to provide the desired forward biasing or reverse biasing of junctions 38 and 40 as the polarity between main terminals T1 andT2 alternates. FIGS. 5 8 illustrate the sequential processing steps for SIT 30. Beginning with a semiconductor body 32, FIG. 6, of one conductivity type such as n type, a plurality of notches 42 are anisotropically etched therein, followed by a shallow p type ion implantation in the notches and drive in diffusion to yield p regions 34, FIG. 7. FIG. 8 isometrically il lustrates the back end of the structure of FIG. 7, wherein during the etching step for notches 42, a transverse notch at 44 is formed for receiving p type material 46 during the p implant and diffusion step, for gate connection. An n deposition is then performed yielding the upper portion 48 of semiconductor body 32. Description Of The Invention FIG. 9 illustrates a vertical JPET 50 constructed in accordance with the invention. JFET 50 includes a semiconductor body 52 of one conductivity type, such as n type. A first set of semiconductor regions 54 in the body defines a first set of channels 56 therebetween. A second set of semiconductor regions 58 defines a second set of channels 60 therebetween.The first and second sets of regions 54 and 58 are of the other conductivity type, such as p type. In preferred form, the first set of channels 56 is substantially coplanar along a first horizontal plane. The second set of channels 60 is substantially coplanar along a second horizontal plane vertically spaced from the first horizontal plane. P regions 54 may or may not be vertically aligned with p regions 58. JFET 50 has an ON state conducting bidirectional current vertically through the first and second sets of channels 56 and 60. JFET 50 has an OFF state blocking current flow through the channels due to horizontal depletion region spreading and pinch off. First gate terminal means G1 is connected to the first set of p regions 54 for controlling conduction through the first set of channels 56. Second gate terminal meansG2 is connected to the second set of p regions 58 for controlling conduction through the second set of channels 60. Depletion region spreading from the junctions 62 between body 52 and the first and second sets of p regions 54 and 58 causes the pinch off OFF state. Depletion region shrinking towards junctions 62 enables the ON state. First main terminal means T1 is connected to the top of semiconductor body 52 by metalization 64, such as deposited aluminum. Second main terminal means T2 is connected to the bottom of semiconductor body 52 by metalization 66. The first gate terminal G1 is referenced to the first main terminal T1, and the second gate terminal G2 is referenced to the second main terminal T2. The gate reference for JFET 50 thus does not have to be commutated between main terminals T1 and T2 for bidirectional current control. In the preferred implementation, JFET 50 is normally OFF. The depletion regions from the first and second sets of p regions 54 and 58 normally extend toward and meet each other in channels 56 and 60 in the absence of bias on gate terminals G1 and G2, such that the channels are normally pinched OFF. JFET 50 is turned ON by biasing first and second gate terminals G1 and G2 to shrink the depletion regions back toward junctions 62 and open the conductive channels therebetween such that current can flow between main terminals T1 and T2.The main terminals are connected in anAC load line including AC power source 68 and load 70. with switches 72 and 74 in their upward position, gate terminals G1 and G2 are biased positively by respective gating voltage sources 76 and 78 relative to respectively referenced main terminals T1 and T2. Alternatively, JFET 50 may be normally ON, with the depletion regions from first and second sets of p regions 54 and 58 normally extending only partially towards each other to leave open the conductive channels therebetween such that current can flow between main terminals T1 and T2. JFET 50 is turned OFF by biasing first and second gates G1 and G2 to spread the depletion regions and pinch off channels 56 and 60. with switches 72 and 74 in their downward position, junctions 62 are reverse biased by the negative gate potential applied respectively at G1 and G2 relative to respectively referenced main terminals T1 andT2. JFET 50 is preferably formed from a combination of the known processing steps for Schockley gridistor 2, FIG. 1, and SIT 30, FIG. 5. The initial processing steps are those of FIGS. 1 4, with upper and lower body portions 26 and 4 of FIG. 1 corresponding to body portions 52 and 80 of FIG. 9. The processing steps of FIGS. 5 8 are then performed, using body portion 52 of FIG. 9 as the starting semiconductor body portion 32 of FIGS. 5 8. Upper body portion 82 of FIG. 9 corresponds to upper body portion 48 of FIG. 5. This fabrication method for the structure of FIG. 9 is preferred because it utilizes known processing steps. The resulting structure provides in combination a Schockley gridistor vertically integrated with a static induction transistor to provide a double gate JFET eliminating the need to commutate a single gate reference between alternating polarity main terminals for bidirectional current control. It is recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the appended claims.
