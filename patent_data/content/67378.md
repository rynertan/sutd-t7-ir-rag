# Constrained adaptive equalizer.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a constrained adaptive equalizer 10 for use in a digital communication system receiver combining transversal and decision feedback equalization techniques. The constrained adaptive equalizer 10 uses a constraint on the taps of the transversal section 13 of the equalizer which has both leading and lagging taps. These constraints force the transversal equalizer 13 to correct only the leading echoes of a received digital signal 12 in a communication system and treat them as if they resulted only from phase distortion. The constrained adaptive equalizer 10 provides a means for equalization that minimizes noise amplification while reducing inter symbol interference. The transversal segment 13 of the constrained adaptive equalizer 10 approximate the phase equalizer by constraining its multi plying coefficients in accordance with the symmetry of the differential delay characteristic of the transmission medium around a signal carrier frequency. This constrained transver sal decision feedback equalizer combination can be used for either passband or baseband equalization and for either complex signals, such as QAM signals, or real signals, such as baseband single side band signal.
