## Description
TITLE Improved Hot Melt Adhesive Comnosition DESCRIPTIONTechnical Field This invention relates to hot melt adhesive and sealant compositions which can be used, for example, as sealants for double glazing units to be used as windows, as adhesives for automobile windows, as architectural glass sealants, as sealants in solar collectors, as load bearing sealants in automotive, appliance, or aerospace applications, or as jet apron sealants.In particular, this invention relates to such adhesive and sealant compositions which are based on alkali metal ionomers of random copolymers prepared from ethylene, methyl acrylate, and at least one carboxylated unsaturated monomer, and the improvement of viscosity stability of such compositions, particularly when such compositions are subjected to high temperature, such as just prior to and during application of the adhesive.Background Art U.S. Patent No. 4,031,058, granted June 21, 1977 to Cella, discloses certain hot melt adhesive and sealant compositions based on sodium or potassium ionomers of random ethylene methyl acrylate monoethyl maleate terpolymers. The compositions of Cella are representative of compositions improved by the present invention. Similar compositions can be prepared from related terpolymers wherein the monoethyl maleate is replaced by other carboxylated monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and maleic acid. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention relates to hot melt adhesive and sealant compositions which are based on alkali metal ionomers of random copolymers of ethylene, methyl acrylate and at least one carboxylated monomer, to the improvement of the viscosity stability of such compositions, particularly at high temperature, by including in such compositions 0.05 10 preferably 0.1 10 parts 100 parts of copolymer of ammonium polyphosphate, and to masterbatch compositions useful in the preparation of such improved adhesive and sealant compositions.In addition to the improved viscosity stability, such adhesive and sealant compositions offer the following noteworthy characteristics 1. ligh mechanical strength and dead load creep resistance extending. up to 1000C while still allowing pumping at 150 2000C. 2. Low temperature flexibility down to 600C. 3. Outstanding oil and jet fuel resistance. 4. Excellent weathering and ultra violet resistance. 5. Good adhesion to many substrates, including glass and metals, without priming. As described in greater detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,031,058, one type of random copolymer which can be improved by the present invention contains about 50 to 60 wt. polymerized methyl acrylate units, about 3 to 5 wt. z polymerized maleic acid monoethyl ester mono ethyl maleate units and about 35 to 47 wt. polymer ized units of ethylene. Suitable copolymers may contain other carboxylated unsaturated termonomers in place of the monoethyl maleate, and may also contain minor amounts of other polymeric units such as those listed in U.S. Patent No. 3,264,272, granted August 2, 1966 to Rees.Useful carboxylated unsaturated ter monomers include those represented by the general formulaEMI2.1 where X is g COOH or COOR, where R is Cl to C6 alkyl and where Y is B or CX3 . C Preferred termonomers are monoethyl maleate, acrylic acid and maleic acid. Between about 5 and about 60 of the carboxylic acid groups in the copolymer are neutralized with an alkali metal, preferably sodium and or potassium ions. Processes for the neutrali ation of acid groups in random ethylene copolymers are taught in U.S. Patent No. 3,404,134, granted October 1, 1968 to Rees.Preferably, the copolymer prior to neutralization has a molecular weight such that the melt index of the copolymer is within the range of about 1 to 30 g per 10 minutes, ASTM D 1238, 190or, 2160 g weight. The adhesive and sealant compositions of the present invention will generally contain, in addition to the terpolymer ionomer and the ammonium poly phosphateione or more of the following tackifying resin, plasticizer and filler. The masterbatch compositions of the present invention will contain the terpolymer monomer, the ammonium polyphosphate, and at least one, but generally not all, of the additives described hereinafter. Preferably, the masterbatch compositions contain only the terpolymer monomer, the ammonium polyphosphate, and an inorganic filler, generally carbon black. The base terpolymer ionomer is difficult to isolate in the raw state, and carbon black provides an unusually strong reinforcing interaction with the ionic groupings, which greatly enhances sealant strength.In preparing the novel adhesive and sealant compositions of this invention, one can also use a conventional masterbatch free of ammonium polyphosphate and add the polyphosphate during adhesive or sealant preparation. It should be noted that during preparation of the masterbatch, temperature control is important to provide efficient mixing while avoiding thermal degradation of the polymer. A preferred procedure comprises mixing the masterbatch, materials in an internal mixer at 70 2050C, preferably 80 1600C, and extruding the resulting blend at 100 2050C, preferably 130 1950C. If temperatures in excess of those specified are used, the resulting masterbatch will produce hot melt sealants which have a tendency to increase in viscosity, particularly in the absence of ammonium polyphosphate, or even undergo gelation. While this undesirable instability can be substantially overcome or even eliminated by the presence of ammonium polyphosphate, it is still recommended that masterbatch preparation be performed within the suggested temperature ranges. It should be further noted that during preparation of the masterbatch from the terpolymer, interaction of the terpolymer with the basic alkali metal compound to form the ionomer should be substantially completed before the ammonium polyphosphate is added. The amount of ammonium polyphosphate use is relatively small thus it may be convenient to add it in the form of a blend with a minor portion of the carbon blade and or a minor portion of the random copolymer. Tackifiers suitable for use in the compositions of the present invention include commercially available resins such as a Picco 6110 resin sold by Hercules Incorporated, which is a highly aromatic hydrocarbon resin, petroleum based, with a softening point, R B, of 108 1120C and a density at 2000C of 1060 kg m3 b Picco 6140 resin sold by Hercules Incorporated, which is a highly aromatic hydrocarbon resin, petroleum based, with a softening point, R B, of 140 144 C and a density at 250C of 1070 kg m3 c Piccovar AP 10 sold by Hercules Incorporated, which is an alkyl aromatic product that is soluble in aliphatic hydro carbons, with a color range on the coal tar scale of 4 6, a softening point of 10 C, a maximum acid number of 1, a maximum saponi fication number of 1, a specific gravity of 0.93 and a melt viscosity of 0.1 Pa s at 85 C, 1.0 Pa s at 630C and 10 Pa s at 400cut and d Piccoumaron 10 sold by Hercules Incorporated, which is a polyindene type polymer with a color range on the coal tar scale of 3 5, a softening point of lO0C, a maximum acid number of I, a maximum saponification number of 1, a specific gravity of 1.04, and a melt viscosity of 0.1 Pas at 9SOC, 1.0 Pa.s at 550C, and 10 Pa.s at 400C.Other tackifying resins can also be used, see, e.g.,U.S. Patent No. 3,573,240, issued March 30, 1971 toFlanagan. The amount of tackifying resin in the hot melt adhesive of the present invention is between about 0 parts by wt. to about 250 parts by wt. per 100 parts by wt. of the random copolymer of ethylene, methyl acrylate and at least one carboxylated unsaturated monomer. Mixtures of tackifiers can also be used. Selection of tackifiers, as well as selection of the other compounding additives, is dictated by compatibility as well as by the properties desired in the sealant. Tackifying resins are considered incompatible either if they are difficult to incorporate into the rubber or if phase separation blooming occurs on standing. Compatibility can be readily determined using a pressed slab of 50 50 tackifier masterbatch composition. Most common types of tackifier are compat ible, but the results summarized in Table I below will offer an additional guidance.

Inorganic fillers suitable for use in the adhesive and sealant compositions of the present invention should be present in the adhesive in the amount of about 5 parts by wt. to about 200 parts by wt. per 100 parts by wt. of the copolymer of ethylene, methyl acrylate, and at least one carboxylated unsaturated monomer. Suitable inorganic fillers include carbon black, calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide, talcs, clays, mica, alumina and silica. Mixtures of fillers can also be used. Carbon black can be used as a filler in the compositions of the present invention to increase mechanical strength and hardness and to decrease the raw materials cost, but it can also reduce adhesion.Mineral fillers such as calcium carbonate or talcs can also be added, but because the terpolymer is only partially neutralized, caution must be exercised when incorporating such materials containing metal ions to prevent an excess of ionomeric crosslinking. Thus, certain types of whiting e.g., Super ultifex will cause the polymer to become nervy, while others e.g., Atomite act as inert fillers. This reactivity can be taken advantage of to increase the degree of ionic cross linking in a controlled manner if desired bv adding up to about 2 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the copolymer of ethylene, methyl acrylate, and at least one carboxylated unsaturated monomer of a reactive base or salt such as potassium hydroxide, sodium acetate or sodium carbonate decahydrate. Additives containing monovalent cations are preferred.Addition of white fillers may also induce blowing at iao0c or above. Plasticizers suitable for use in the adhesive and sealant compositions of the present invention should be present in the adhesive in an amount of about 10 parts by weight to about 150 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the copolymer of ethylene, methyl acrylate, and at least one carboxylated unsat urated monomer. Suitable plasticizers include the chlorinated paraffins, such as Chlorowax 40, sold by Diamond Shamrock Corporation, which is a 408 chlori nated paraffin and has a Brookfield viscosity of 32 poises. Polyester plasticizers such as Harflex 330, sold by Wallace and Tiernan Inc., a polymeric plas ticizer of 1,3 butylene glycol and adipic acid, having a viscosity of 2340 centipoises at 100OF are also suitable. Preferred plasticizers include tri 2 ethylhexyl trimellitate di 2 ethylhexyl sebacatet Plastolein 9772, sold by Emery Industries, which is a polymeric polyester plasticizer with a solidification point of 90C, a specific gravity 250 250C of 1.04, an acid number of less than 3.0 and a hydroxyl number of about 15 and Plastolein 9734, sold by Emery Industries, which is a polymeric polyester plasticizer with a solidification point of 130C, a specific gravity 250 250C of 1.04, an acid number greater than 3.0 and a hydroxyl number of about 17. The terpolymer used in the compositions of the present invention possesses high oil resistance and is not generally compatible with hydrocarbon oils.However, it is compatible with most other common types of plasticizers, including esters and chlorinated compounds. In general, car should be exercised in using phosphate ester plasticizers because variable results have been obtained when they are used in the compositions of this invention. Adhesive and sealant compositions intended for pertain uses must not contain components which will slowly bleed out and deposit on the substrate surfaces fogging . The fog resistance of various tackifiers and plasticizers can be readily evaluated by heating them with a sunlamp to 700C in a container covered high a re frigerated plate at 150C and examining the plate for resides after periods up to one week.Data for fog resistance of common plasticiers and tackifiers are given in Tables 2 and 3 below TABLE 2 FOG RESISTANCE OF SOMEPLASTICIZERS FOR ETHYLENE ACRYLIC ESTER IONOMER Fog 1 Trade Same Chemical Name ResistanceBenzoflex 9 88SG Dipropylene Glycol Dibenzoate EBenzoflex S5i2 Pentaerythritol Tetrabenzoate EChlorowax 40 Chlorinated Hydrocarbon FChlorowax 70 Chlorinated Hydrocarbon FCitroflex A 4 Acetyltributyl Citrate FDibutoxyethyl Phthalate Dibutoxyethyl Phthalate PDioctyl Adipate Dioctyl Adipate EDioctyl Phthalate Dioctyl Phthalate PDioctyl Sebacate Dioctyl Sebacate E Flexol 3GH Triethylene Glycol Di 2 Ethylbutyrate PFlexol 4GO Polyethylene Glycol Dioctoate G Flexol 10 10 Didecyl Phthalate E Flexol TOF Tri 2 Ethylhexyl Phosphate GHatcol TOTS Trioctyl Trimellitate G Kenplast G Aromatic Hydrocarbon PKenplast LT Aromatic Hydrocarbon P Monoplex S 70 Monomeric Epoxy Ester PMonoplex S 73 Monomeric Epoxy Ester PMonoplex S 75 Epoxy Ester PParaplex G 25 High Molecular Weight Polyester F Parables G 40 High Molecular Weight Polyester G Parables G 41 High Molecular Weight Polyester P Paraplex G 62 High Molecular Weight Soybean Oil Epozide FPlastolein 9734 Polyester EPX 119 Mixed Isoalkyl Phthalate E Px 126 Ditridecyl Phthalate EPX 220 RTI ID 10.19 Diisodecyl Adipate EPX 318 Mixed Normal Alkyl Phthalate E PX 337 Trtisooctyl Trimallitate F ÚE Excelle G Good F Fair P Poor TABLE 2 Continued FoglTrade Name Chemical Name ResistanceSanticizer 409 Dibasic Acid and Glycol Polymeric PTP 90B Di Butoxy Ethoxy Ethyl Formal PTP 95 Di Butoxy Ethoxy Ethyl Adipate P Trdbutyl Phosphate Tributyl Phosphate PTricresylPhosphate Tricresyl Phosphate EUniflex 330 Polyester lE t Excellent G Good F Fair P s Poor TABLE 3 FOG RESISTANCE OF SOME TACKIFYING RESINSTrade Name Softening Point.

Flow properties, dead load creep resistance and high temperature strength can often be improved by adding small quantities, up to 30 phr and preferably 2 to 25,phr of reinforcing resins. Preferred reinforcing resins include a Emery 1540 polyamide resin, sold by Emery Industries, which is a dimer acid based polyamide resin, with a softening point of 105 1150C, an amine number of 4, an acid number of 4, and a specific gravity 25 250C of 0.98 b Versamid 900, sold by General Mills Chemicals, which is a polyamide resin, fatty acid based, with a softening point of 170 1900C, and an amine value of 40 50 c Vitel 4709A, sold by Goodyear, which is a polyester resin, with a melting point of 1300C, an inherent viscosity of 0.65, a density of 1295 kg m , and a carboxyl content eq 106g of less than 45 d Styron 666U, sold by Dow Chemical, which is a polystyrene resin of s.g. 1.04, melt flow rate ASTM D1278 7.5 g 10 minutes and Vicat softening point 100JC and e Kraton G 1652, styrene ethylene block copolymer sold as crump by Shell Chemical Company density 910 kg m3 hardness Shore A 75. Up to about 2 parts by weight of silane or polymethyl hydrogen siloxane per 100 parts of the terpolymer can be added to impart high resistance to loss of adhesion to glass in hot water soak or highly humid environments without adverse effect on other properties. Involatile silanes such as vinyl tris 2methoxyethoxy silane and a methacryloxypropyl trimeth oxy silane, or polymethyl hydrogen siloxanes such asDow Corning 1107 Fluid, are suitable. Silanes containing amino or epoxy groups should be avoided since they may induce crosslinking. As mentioned above, the viscosity stability, particularly at high temperatures, of hot melt adhesive and sealant compositions which are based on alkali metal ionomers of random copolymers of ethylene, methyl acrylate and at least one carboxylated unsaturated monomer is significantly improved by including in such compositions 0.05 10 preferably 0.1 10 phr of ammonium polyphosphate. The amount of ammonium polyphosphate required to significantly improve sealant stability is generally smaller when the polyphosphate is added to the masterbatch, rather than to the sealant composition. As little as 0.05 phr of ammonium polyphosphate will effect a significant stability increase when added to the masterbatch. When added to the sealant composition, a minimum of 0.5 phr of ammonium polyphosphate is suggested. A particularly suitable ammonium polyphosphate is Phos Chek P 30 fire retardant, sold by MonsantoCompany, which is an ammonium polyphosphate with a phosphorus weight percent of 32, an insolubility in water at 250C of 92 based upon 10 grams slurried in 100 grams of water for one hour , and has a particle size distribution such that 90 weight will pass through a 325 mesh screen. In addition, suitable ammonium polyphosphates are those described in U.S.Patent No. 3,562,197, granted February 9, 1971 toSears and Vandersall. In particular, suitable ammonium polyphosphates include those water insoluble compounds having a P O P linkage and having the general formula H ETHL mP O n m 2 4 m n 3n l wherein n is an integer having an average value greater than 10, m n has an average value between about 0.7 and about 1.1 and m has a maximum value equal to n 2. These polymeric polyphosphates can be either straight chain structures or branched chain structures.It should be noted that substantially all of the nitrogen in these polyphosphates is present as the ammoniacal nitrogen and there is substantially no nuclear nitrogen present in the polyphosphates. In addition, when these polyphosphates are characterized as being substantially water insoluble it is intended to mean that the solubility of a slurry of 10 grams of solids 100 cc. of water at 250C for 60 minutes is about 5 grams 100 cc. of water or less. Starting with the ionomer masterbatch described hereinbefore, the adhesive and sealant compositions of the present invention can be prepared in aSigma mixer, kneader extruder, or similar equipment.The mixing time is 45 90 minutes at 120 1600C depending on the compounding ingredients employed. The most preferred procedure is to melt the tackifying resins in the mixer and add part of the filler, if used. The masterbatch and remaining filler is then gradually added while keeping the viscosity as high as possible to maximize shear by adding only enough plasticizer to allow the mixer to operate. The remaining plasticizer is added towards the end of the mix followed by any other resins used. Silane is preferably added only a few minutes before the mixing is stopped. If ammonium polyphosphate has not been added in the preparation of the masterbatch, it may be added during preparation of the adhesive or sealant composition. If no additional reactive base is to be added to adjust the degree of ionic cross linking of the terpolymer, it should be added as early in the mixing process as possible and preferably added to the tackifying resin first placed in the mixer before the addition of the masterbatch. If a reactive base is to be added to adjust the level of crosslinking, the ammonium polyphosphate should be added only after this base has interacted with the terpolymer, but in any case before the addition of a reinforcing resin such as a polyamide. The following examples identify various specific adhesive and sealant compositions of the present invention and demonstrate the superior viscosity stability of such compositions as compared with compositions without ammonium polyphosphate but which are otherwise equivalent.

The Ammonium polyphosphate, if used, and about a tenth of the total amount of plasticizer was next added and the mixer turned on to partially soften the resins. TheMixture A was then added and mixed for about 15 minutes until the entire mass was uniform.The Suzorite mica and Styron 666 U or Kraton G 1652 were then added and mixed for about 10 minutes, after which the remainder of the plasticizer was added. Mixing was then continued to give a total mixing time of 45 60 minutes to produce a smooth, uniform mass of the sealant. The vinyl tris 2 methoxyethoxy silane was added about 5 10 minutes before mixing was completed. The thermal stabilities of these formulations were determined by viscosity measurements at 205 C using the procedure of Example 1.

In addition, these compositions can be extruded into tapes suitable for cold manual application. These compositions can be used, for example, as sealants for double glazing units to be used as windows, as adhesives for automobile windows, as architectural glass sealants, as sealants in solar collectors, as load bearing sealants for automotive, appliance and aerospace applications, or as jet apron sealants. These compositions can be used as adhesives for a variety of substrates including glass, aluminum, steel, copper, zinc, brass, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, and fiber reinforced plastics. Best Mode Although the best mode of the present invention, i.e., the single most preferred adhesive and sealant composition of the present invention, will depend on the particular desired end use and the specific requisite combination of properties for that use, the single most preferred composition for the widest variety of possible end uses will generally conform to the composition described in Example 7B.
