# Apparatus and method for providing electron beam patterns using expanded beam array.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for forming scanned electron beam patterns which finds particular use in multiple beam cathode ray tubes. Instead of using the vertical line array of electron beam sources which is used in conventional multiple beam tubes, a two dimensional expanded beam array 30, 31, 32, 74 is provided. The expanded array is such that no two electron beams in the array are disposed in the same scan line and it is of a geometric shape having comparable length and width dimensions. In order to form characters or other pat terns logic circuitry 80 120 is provided to control each beam of the expanded array at respective scanning positions as the array is deflected or scanned across the screen of the cathode ray tube.
