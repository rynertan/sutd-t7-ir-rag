# A process for preparing glucagon or derivatives thereof in a transformed yeast strain.

## Abstract
Glucagon or fragments or derivatives thereof are pre pared by cultivation of a yeast strain transformed with a replicable expression vehicle comprising a gene encoding the expression of such products. Synthetic genes encoding glucagon or derivatives thereof have been constructed. Also provided are replicable expression vehicles comprising a replication system for providing stable maintenance in yeast and a DNA sequence encluding glucagon or fragments or derivatives thereof and transformant yeast strains containing such expression vehicles.
