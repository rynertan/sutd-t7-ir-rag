# Process for manufacturing sacks, bags, and the like.

## Abstract
In a process for manufacturing sacks of sheet material, flat tubes 4 are fed one by one in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction thereof, while the tubes are over lapped by a predetermined distance. The tubes 4 are wound one by one on a reel core 10a with the help of a tape 9 , which is connected at one end thereof to the reel core 10a and continuously supplied with the rotation of the reel core. The tubes are secured on the reel core by pressure supplied by the tape to form a tube wound reel 10b having a desired diameter. After a certain time period and immediately before the subsequent bottom closing process, the tubes are unwound from the reel core by pulling the tape to rotate the reel. The overlapped tubes are then separated from each other and supplied one by one to a bottom closing station.
