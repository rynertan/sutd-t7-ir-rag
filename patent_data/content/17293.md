## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING COMPLEX SUSPENSION FERTILIZERS The invention relates to a process for preparing complex suspension fertilizers by ammoniation of a liquid obtained by digestion of phosphate rock with nitric acid and complete or substantial removal of the calcium. Such a process is known from the Dutch Applications Laid Open ToPublic Inspection Nos. 6.610.521 and 6.818.164. In the process described in the Dutch Application Laid Open To Public Inspection, No, 6.610.521, a large part of the calcium is crystallized out from the digestion liquor as calcium nitrate tetrahydrate by cooling, upon which the crystals are separated and, with firm stirring, the remaining mother liquor is put in an already neutralized solution together with ammonia, while a pH of 6 8 is maintained at a temperature of 10 70 C.In the process described in the Dutch Application Laid Open to PublicInspection, no. 6.818.164, the phosphate rock is digested with nitric acid in the presence of ammonium bisulphate so that the calcium precipitates as calcium sulphate dihydrate. The mixture is filtered and the filtrate is ammoniated. A drawback in these known processes is that in a one step ammoniation of the digestion liquor to a product of a pH of 6 it will be difficult to control the crystallization process. There will be a strong formation Of coarse crystals1 resulting in a product suspension which shows little homogeneity and which is therefore less stable. This phenomenon will be stronger as the ammonium nitrate content of the mixture is greater. Another draw back in the known processes is that the impurities in the digestion liquor originating from the phosphate rock may give rise to the formation of gel like compounds, which will result in a strong increase in the viscosity of the product.Moreover, when applying some kinds of rock phosphate, a greater or smaller quantity of citrate insoluble tricalcium phosphate and or fluor apatite is formed in the ammoniation by the calcium still present, which means a loss of nutrient phosphate. Finally, the known processes also have the drawback that in a one step ammoniation to a pH 6 there will be a strong temperature increase, resulting in a escape of relatively large quantities of ammonia. Now, the invention provides a process which makes it possible for the liquid obtained in a digestion of phosphate rock with nitric acid, with all or much of the calcium removed from it, to be converted into stable, concentrated suspension fertilizers, and in which the above mentioned drawbacks occure hardly or not at all. This is achieved, according to the invention, by ammoniation of the digestion liquid in at least three neutralization steps, in which process the temperature in each neutralization step is lower than the temperature in the proceding step and the reaction liquid is quickly cooled between the second and the third neutralization step with formation of a suspension. The digestion liquid to be applied in the process according to the invention may have been obtained in various ways, known as such, for instance, as described above, by substantial crystallization of the calcium as calcium nitrate tetrahydrate effected by cooling a digestion mixture of rock phosphate with nitric acid, and or by precipitation of the calcium as calcium sulphate dihydrate, effected by addition of a sulphate containing reagent, particularly ammonium sulphate. The liquid thus obtained mainly consists of phosphoric acid, ammonium nitrate, possibly free nitric acid, and a quantity of calcium nitrate. According to the invention, the digestion liquid thus formed is ammoniated in at least three neutralization steps. Preferably the ammoniation is effected in three steps and in such a manner that in the final step a product of a pH of between 6.5 and 7.5 is obtained. As ammonia source, gaseous ammonia can be used in the first place, but liquid ammonia can be used as well. Optionally, an aquous ammonia solution can also be applied, which is less attractive, however, because it will cause a decrease in the nutrient content of the product. Preferably, the ammoniation in the first step is effected at a relatively high temperature, but in such a manner that the reaction liquid does not boil. To this end a temperature of between 90 OC and the boiling point of the liquid is applied. Depending on the composition of the reaction liquid, this boiling point is about 100 120 OC It is particularly advantageous to choose in the first neutralization step a reaction temperature of between 95 and 105 OC because optimum use will then be made of the heat of reaction. In this case the ammoniation is continued until a pH of the reaction liquid of between 1.5 and 5.0, more particularly between 3.5 and 4.5 has been reached. Ammoniation to higher pH values is undesirable, because there will then be rather heavy ammonia losses. Wherever in this application mention is made of a particular pH, it is understood to mean the measured pH of a solution obtained by diluting one part of product with four parts of water. The residence time of the liquid in the first neutraliztion step is preferably more than 10 minutes1 particularly about 20 minutes.Longer residence times can be applied without any objection, but do not bring any extra advantagas. A residence time shorter than 10 minutes is less desirable,because the end product has been found in that case to show a rather strong increase in viscosity. In the second neutralization step the ammoniation is effected at a lower temperature than that of the first step. Preferably a temperature of between 65 and 90 C, more specifically of between 75 and 85 C, is applied here. Preferably, this temperature is controlled by means of a return flow of cooled reaction mixture from the coolercrystallizer installed behind this second step.The ammoniation in this second step is preferably continued till a pH of the reaction liquid of between 5.5 and 6.5, more specifically of between 5.5 and 6.0, has been reached. Ammoniation to a lower pF will result in an undesired formation of monoammonium phosphate. Amiamoniation to 2 higher pH will result in the formation of diammonium phosphate, however in the form of crystals platelets that are too thick, causing a strong decline in the stability of the end product. The residence time in this second step is not critical but is preferably chosen between 10 and 30 minutes. The reaction liquid from the second neutralization reactor is passed to a cooler and quickly cooled there, in tnich process a suspension of very many very fine crystals is forme. It has appeared that in order to obtain a qualitatively good suspension rapid cooling of the liquid to a temperature of below 40 OC is necessary. Preferably the cooling is effected within less than 5 seconds. ost preferably the liquid is cooled practically instantaneously to a temperature of 35 oC or lower. After the cooler the suspension is further ammoniated to a product of the required p. This ammoniation can be effected in one or more steps. Preferably this final ammoniation is effected in one step.The temperature in this final neutralization step is kept rather low, particularly below 40 C. The ammoniation is preferably continued untill a pH of the suspension of between 6.5 and 7.5 has been reached. The residence time of the suspension in this these ammoniation step s is not critical. but is preferably chosen between 10 and 30 minutes. Preferably care is taken that the product from the final neutralization step contains a stabilizing agent for the suspension formed. I9 phosphate rock of a high clay content is started from, the resulting suspension may contain so much clay as to make the addition of a stabilizing agent superfluous. Mostly, however, it is necessary to add to the suspension in the final neutralization step a quantity of stabilizing agent. As it has proved to be very difficult to disperse the stabilizing agent in dry form in the medium containing ammonium nitrate, the stabilizing agent is preferably added in the form of a suspension in a liquid medium, which is prepared beforehand. Ag stabilizing agent various stabilizing agents, known as such, can be used, for instance atapulgite or bentonite. Preferably attapulgite clay is used. The stabilizing agent is then suspended beforehand in a liquid medium, such as water, to which a surface active substance, for instance tetrasodium pyrophosphate, has been added if so desired. Specifically, a 20 30 weight suspension of a clay in water is added. The quantity of stabilizing agent depends on the nature .of the agent applied and on the concentration and composition of the suspension to be stabilized. When a clay is used as stabilizing agent, preference is given to the use of 0.5 3 by weight of clay, calculated as solid in relation to the quantity by weight of suspension. In the preparation of complex suspension fertilizers it is desirable for the product to have a high nutrient content. As in applying the process according to the invention a rather large quantity of water may be brought into the system by the reaction components, for instance the nitric acid used or the digestion and the sulphate added for the precipitation of gypsum, the resulting product will sometimes be of a relatively high water content and consequently of a lower nutrient content. It may then be advantageous to incorporate between the first and the second neutralization step an evaporation step. In this evaporation step the reaction liquid is evaporated to a water content of between 20 and 30 by weight, more specifically 22 26 by weight, preferably at a temperature of about 120 C at most.An evaporation temperature of more than about 120 C is not desirable, because it has appeared that the end product will then become very viscous. During this evaporation process foaming may occur to a greater or less degree, depending on the quantity of impurities in the reaction liquid. In order to reduce this, a quantity of anti foaming agent may be added to the liquid in the evaporator, if desired. As such various agents, known as such, for instance alkali salts of sulphonated higher fatty acids, can be used. The suspension formed in applying the process according to the invention can as such be used as suspension fertilizer. Depending on the composition of the digestion liquid and,the degree of ammoniation and optionally evaporation, products of different nutrient content can be prepared, for instance of an N content and a P205 content of 22 11 and 19 16. The suspensions formed show little viscosity and are very stable and can be kept for a long time, for instance for more than 6 months, without deterioration in quality. It has appeared that, during storage, deposits of large ammonium nitrate crystals may be formed on the boundary surface between the clear liquid layer and the suspension.This phenomenon will be stronger as the ammonium nitrate content of the suspension is higher. It may then be important periodically to agitate the suspension during the storage. This may be done by regularly, for instance once to 3 times a week, homogenizing the suspension in a manner known as such, for instance by passing air through it. It is also possible to mix the resulting suspension with other nutrient components and or to add to the suspension one or more biocides, such as herbicides, and or pesticides. Nutrient components which may be used are, for instance, ammonium phosphates, optionally in the form of a suspension, urea, urea ammonium nitrate solutions, potassium salts, such as potassium chloride or potassium sulphate. The use of urea as a nutrient component proves to have an extra advantage, because the urea dissolves in the liquid phase of the suspension, resulting in a product containing more liquid phase, which is less viscous particularly on storage at low temperature e.g. O OC Apart from the addition of nutrient components to the finished suspension, it is also possible for one or more nutrient components to be added during the preparation of the suspension, for instance to the digestion liquid or in one of the neutralization steps. If, for instance, a suspension fertilizer of a lower N P205 ratio is desired a quantity of phosphoric acid may be added before or during the neutralization. Also the suspensions thus obtained show excellent storage qualities. The invention will be elucidated by means of the annexed flow sheet. A reactor A is fed, from ammonia line 1 via line 2, with ammonia, ánd viaoaine 5 with a liquid obtained in a phosphate digestion notshown Via line 6 the reaction liquid is optionally passed to an evaporator B, to which is supplied, via line 15, an anti foaming agent. The evaporated water is discharged via line 14. The evaporated liquor is passed, via line 7, to a reactor C, to which ammonia is supplied via line 3 and, optionally cooled suspension via line 13. The reactor liquid flows via line 8 to the cooler D, which can be cooled by cooled suspension supplied via lines 11 and 12. The suspension formed in cooler D is passed, via line 9, to reactor E, to which ammonia is supplied via. line 4 and a suspension of a stabilizing agent via line 19.Via line 10 product suspension is discharged. To the mixing vessel F a stabilizing agent is supplied via line 16, water via line 17, and a surfactant via line 18. The resulting suspension of stabilizing agent is fed, via line 19, to the reactor E.Example 1 A rock phosphate mixture of Khouribga and Kola phosphate ratio 4 1 was treated 57 st nitric acid in a slight excess in relation to the quantity required stoichiometrically for the digestion to phosphoric acid and calcium nitrate. The resulting liquid reaction mixture was cooled to about 5 OC in which process a large part of the calcium crystallized as calcium nitrate tetrahydrate. After removal of these crystals by centrifugation, a mother liquor of a molar CaO P205 ratio of about 0.5 and a water content of about 25 by weight resulted. This mother liquor was passed continuously in to a stainless steel reactor of a capacity of 1 litre provided with an stirrer, at a throughput rate of about 3.5 kg per hour. Hence, the residence of the mother liquor in the reactor was about 20 minutes. The reactor was also continuously fed with gaseous ammonia, in such a quantity that the pH of the reaction mixture in the reactor was about 4.5.Owing to the released heat of reaction the temperature in the reactor was about 100 OC. The liquid reaction mixture formed in this first reactor was passed continuously to a second similar reactor, which was also continuously fed with gaseous ammonia in such a quantity that the pH of the reaction mixture rose to about 6.0. The temperature in this second reactor was kept at about 80 C by means of a continuous flow of cooled product obtained in a cooler placed behind this reactor. The liquid reaction mixture formed in the second reactor was fed to the said cooler and virtually instantaneously cooled there to about 30 35 C by mixing with a very large quantity of already cooled liquid. In this process a suspension was formed of very fine crystals mainly consisting of diammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrate. As already indicated above, a part of this cooled suspension was recirculated to the second reactor. The rest of the suspension was passed to a third stainless steel reactor, which was continuously fed with gaseous ammonia in such a quantity that the pH of the resulting suspension was 6.9 7.0. The temperature in this third reactor was kept at 30 35 C. To this third reactor attapulgite clay was also supplied, in a quantity of 1.5 by weight, calculated as clay in relation to the quantity by weight of suspension. This supply consisted of a 25 wt suspension in water, to which had beed added, as a surface active substance, 2 by weight of tetrasodium pyrophosphate, calculated in relation to the quantity by weight of clay. From this third reactor a suspension of a nutrient content of about 19 16 0, expressed as N, P205 and K20, respectively, and a water content of about 23 by weight was continuously discharged as product. The finished suspension was passed into a receiving tank and periodically once to 3 times a week homogenized herein by passing air through it. After storage for more than 6 months the suspension still showed no settling of crystals and could, without further treatment, still be used immediately as fertilizer suspension. Example 2 a A part of the 19 16 0 suspension obtained in example 1 was mixed with prill shaped urea in a weight ratio of 83 17. A suspension of a composition of 24 12 0 was obtained, which, on storage for 6 months, again.proved to be very stable. b In the same way 75 parts by weight of the 19 16 0 suspension were mixed with 20 parts by weight of finely divided potassium chloride K20 content 62 and 5 parts by weight of water.A stable suspension of a composition of 14 12 12 was obtained. c In the same way 61 parts by weight of the 19 16 0 suspension were mixed with 33 parts by weight of finely divided potassium sulphate K20 content 54 and 6 parts by weight of water.A stable suspension of a composition of 11 9 17 was obtained.Example 3 A rock phosphate mixture of Khouribga and Kola phosphate ratio 4 1 was treated with a quantity of 57 wt nitric acid stoichiometrically required for the digestion to phosphoric acid and calcium nitrate. To the resulting liquid mixture a solution containing ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate was added, in which process a precipitate of calcium sulphate dihydrate was formed.This precipitate was filtered off, resulting in a filtrate of a molarCaO P205 ratio of 0.5 and a water content of about 50 by weight. This filtrate was ammoniated in a first reactor with gaseous ammonia at a temperature of 95 C until a pH of 4.0 was reached. The liquid reaction mixture formed was passed to an evaporator, where the mixture was heated for about 30 minutes at a temperature of 118 120 OC In this process about 25 by weight of the liquid fed in was evaporated as water. During the evaporation a very small quantity of anti ioaming agent sodium oleyl sulphonate was added to the liquid. The liquid mixture formed was subsequently treated in a second reactor with gaseous ammonia to a pH of 5.7. The temperature in this second reactor was kept at about 85 C by means of a flow of cooled product from the cooler. The reaction mixture was passed to a cooler and virtually instantaneously cooled to about 35 C, in which process a suspension of very fine crystals was formed. A part of this suspension was recirculated as cooling stream to the second reactor. The rest of the suspension was passed to a third reactor, treated there at 35 C with gaseous ammonia to a ph of 6.8, while feeding in a suspension of 25 wt attapulgite in water, in a quantity of 1.5 by weight of attapulgite, calculated to the quantity by weight of suspension. The product discharged from this third reactor was an N P suspension of a nutrient content of 22 11 0 and a water content of 24 by weight. The suspension was stored in the same way as in example 1 and contained no settled crystals after more than 6 months.Example 4 a Of the suspension obtained in example 3, 67 parts by weight were mixed with 33 parts by weight of a urea ammonium nitrate solution nitrogen content 32 . A stable suspension of a composition of 25 7 0 was obtained. b In the same way 50 parts by weight of the suspension obtained in example 3 were mixed with 50 parts by weight of an ammonium phosphate suspension of a composition of 13 38 0. A stable suspension of a composition of 17 24 0 was obtained. c In the same way 82 parts by weight of the suspension obtained in example 3 were mixed with 15 parts by weight of finely divided potassium chloride K20 content 62 3 and 3 parts by weight of water. A stable suspension of a composition of 18 9 9 was obtained. d In the same way 40 parts by weight of the suspension obtained in example 3 were mixed with t0 parts by weight of an ammonium phosphate suspension 13 38 0 and 20 parts by weight of a urea ammonium nitrate solution 32 0 0 . A stable suspension of a composition of 20 20 0 was obtained. e In the same way 67 parts by weight of the suspension obtained in example 3 are mixed with 14 parts by weight of finely divided potassium sulphate K90.content 54 and i9 parts by weight of water. A stable suspension of a composition of l5 7.5 75 was obtained. Example 5 To the filtrate obtained in example 3 after filtering off calcium sulphate dihydrate, phosphoric acid of a P205 content of 2S by weight was added in a weight ratio of about 10 7. The resulting liquid mixture was ammoniated in the same way as in example 3 in a first reactor at 100 C to a pH of 4.5, subsequently evaporated at 115 C, ammoniated in a second reactor at 80 C to a pH of 6.0, cooled to 35 OC and, with addition of an attapulgite suspension, ammoniated in a third reactor at 38 39 OC to a pH of 7.0. The product obtained was a stable suspension of a nutrient content of 17 24 0 and a water content of 23 by weight.
