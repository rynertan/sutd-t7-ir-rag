## Description
Coil for nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus. The invention relates to an excitation and or maasureeent coil for a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus for producing a radio frequency electranagnetic field in a measurement space and for detecting nuclear magnetic resonance signals to be generated by an object under examination in the measurement space. Such a radio frequency coil is known from European PatentApplication EP 0086560 and is indicated therein as an element F or 28. In the case of the saddle coil described therein, which is the most suitable type of coil for many applications in nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus, disadvantages occur in practice. Thus, such a coil often leads to patients suffering a feeling of discomfort due to the fact that the space inside it is copparatively restricted. Furtheucore, the Q value of known coils for use at the usual measurement frequencies, is comparatively low and frequently depends rather closely on the quantity of substance present in the measurement coil, as a result of which the coil has to be retuned in accordance with the object to be measured. Moreover, a re alignment of such a coil can often be effected only with comparatively great difficulty, while in the measurement arrange t the space for treating a patient can became insufficient. The invention has for its object to obviate these disadvantages and according to the invention a radiofrequency coil of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is for this purpose characterized in that the coil is composed of a single self supporting conductor having a carparatively low electrical resistance, whose shape is adapted to the shape of objects to be measured, and in that the coil can be ztc 2nted in the measurement space of a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus so as to be displaceable as a whole. Due to the fact that the coil according to the invention is made so as to be antirely self supporting, it can be readily displaced in a measurement space, as a result of which, if desired, before each image exposure the position can be adapted to the object to be measured. In a preferred esEcdiment, the current conductor has a slightly triangular form at the area at which it extends in a cross sectional plane with respect to the main magnet of a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus, as a result of which fewer problems cxxur when a patient is introduced into the measurement space, and a coil having a higher Q value and a higher it asur t sensitivity is provided. In a further preferred embodiment, the supply leads, viewed in the rotation symmetrical magnetic field, are arranged radially beside one an other, as a result of which less disturbance occurs in situ to the radio frequency field and therefore also to the measurement signal. In a further embodiment, the current conductor consists entirely of a single preferably tubular conductor. Preferably, an electrical screen is arranged to surround the current conductor with the interposition of spacer rings. A few preferred embodiments according to the invention will nok be described more fully with reference to the drawing. In the drawing Figure 1 shows a coil according to the invention catposed of a single tubular electrical conductor, and Figure 2 shows a schematic circuit diagram for tuning and feeding such a coil. A nsumrement detection coil of the kind shown in Figure 1 comprises a first half formed by a saddle coil 1, a second half formed by a saddle coil 2, supply leads 3 and 4 and a control adjust ment device 5. When mounting the coil in a measurement measurement space space within a main magnet for producing a uniform magnetic field parallel to an axis of rotation 7 of the system, straight portions 6 of the coil turns usually also extend parallel to the direction of the main magnetic field Ho. Each of the end conductor portions 8 of similar shape has, as a departure fran the uasual arcuate form, a slightly triangular form, as a result of which a larger amount of free space is provided for patients in a plane through the four apices of the triangles.In an optimized embodSment, the conductor consists of a circular tube having an outer diameter of, for example, 25 itrn and a wall thickness of 1 to 2 mm. As a result, a lower electrical resistance is provided by a readily deformable and satisfactorily self supporting conductor. The conductors can be deformed by the methods commonly used for this purpose. It should then be ensured that no irregularities or cracks occur in the tube material. For safety considerations it is desirable to screen the conductor from the coil by an electrical screen 10 shown in part, while it should be ensured that the screening material could not make contact with the conductor. It is therefore generally favour able to arrange the screening around the conductor with an interstice 11, which can be realized, for example, by means of a few supporting space rings. Measurements have shown that with such a coil loaded by 5011 for usual frequencies up to, for example. 6 MHz a Q value to, for example, 200 can be obtained, as a result of which an im proverrent of the signal to noise ratio in the measurement signals is achieved. In the unloaded condition, the coil yields for the said frequency a g value of 400. Due to the self supporting character of the coil, the coils can be made simple to exchange, as a result if which the coil can be adapted to the patient or to the body part of the patient to be examined or to another object to be examined or to the frequency to be used, while furthermore some treatment can be applied to a patient arranged in the coil. Figure 2 shows a schematic circuit diagram of a connecting circuit for the coil for the purpose of tuning, feeding and signal detection. A supply generator or a signal detector can be connected to the terminals 15 and 16. Two capacitors 18 and 19 are connected parallel to the coil, which in this case is indicated as an inductor 17, while a capacitor 20 is connected in series therewith. The inductance of the coil is, for example, about 1.5 uH the capacitance values of the capacitor 18 and of the capacitors 19 and 20 are about 300 pF and, for example, 120 pF, respectively. The tuning and matching capacitances are arranged in parallel for the resonance frequency in the given example, the overall capacitance becomes 300 120 120 540 pF, which together with the inductance L 1.5 ,uH leads to a resonance frequency of about 6 MHz. The capacitance values of the capacitors 19 and 20 are adjustable. Each of these capacitors can be independently adjustable, but it is also possible for th m to be simultaneously adjustable, in which event for an optimum adjustment the capacitor 18 can also be controlled. A more symmetrical form of tuning can be provided by connecting an additional capacitor between the capacitor 19 and the oonneotion terminal 16, which is adjustable simultaneously with the capacitors 19 and 20 in a manner such that the sum of the capacitances 19 and 20 is constant. A symmetrical form of construction can also be provided by connecting the terminal 16 to a tapping point on the coil, the capacitors 18 and 19 being ocrrYM bei across the coil 17.
