# RETARGETABLE CODE GENERATOR USING UP DOWN PARSING

## Abstract
A compiler for generating an assembly language listing of instructions for a programmable data processor from a high level programming language has elements for generating from the high level programming language input, an intermediate representation of the programming language input and for generating from the intermediate representation, an assembly language representation of the high level programming lan guage input. The compiler operates generally in accordance with the Glanville Graham method which enables the compiler to be used with different machines. The resulting retargetable compiler is improved by employing an up down parsing meth od in the code generator portion which removes significant re strictions found when LR parsing is employed. The parsing method allows preprocessing of the prefix grammer represent ing the input intermediate representation for producing, for use by the code generator parsing element, a state table, an ex tended state table, and a state transition table.
