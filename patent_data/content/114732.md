# BLOOD OXYGENATOR HEAT EXCHANGER

## Abstract
A blood oxygenator 200 for oxygenating venous blood thereby producing oxygenated arterial blood. The blood oxygenator includes a heat exchanger 218 for transferring heat with the blood, preferably the venous blood, prior to, or in conjunction with, oxygenation, the heat exchanger being of a coiled bellows configuration including a plurality of individual smooth rounded surface ribs 219 spaced apart by smaller diameter sections 220 . Preferably, inner 110 and outer 114 scalloped members engage opposed por tions of the bellows ribs providing a spiral, gently undulating blood flow path along adjacent windings of the heat exchanger coil.
