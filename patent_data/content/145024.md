# Tubular core for a shirred casing article.

## Abstract
A tubular core for use in fabricating a cored casing article, the core having its aft end portion provided with a plurality of spaced ramp shaped elements which extend about the periphery of the aft end portion. The elements permit one way loading of a shirred casing stick over the aft end and onto the core while resisting the axial growth of the casing stick in an aft direction.
