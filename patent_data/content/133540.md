# Receptor assays using labeled monoclonal anti idiotypic antibodies.

## Abstract
Labeled, monoclonal, anti idiotypic antibodies capable of binding to preselected biospecific cellular receptors are contacted with peripheral blood cells. The amount of label biospecifically adsorbed to the cells is a measure of the receptor level on the cell. This receptor level measurement can be used as an alternative to tissue biopsy.
