## Description
PROCESS FOR TRANSPORTING PARTICUL TE MATERIAL The invention relates to a process for transporting particulate material fram a low pressure zone to an elevated pressure zone, characterized in that 1 the material is passed from the low pressure zone to the top of the first one of a series of at least two vertical oblong vessels 2 the material is passed as a moving bed fram the top of each vessel to the bottom thereof by gravity 3 the material is transported fram the bottam of each vessel to the top of the subsequent vessel 4 the gas pressure at the top of the first vessel is kept relatively low, while the gas pressure at the top of each successive vessel kept kept substantially equal to then gas pressure prevailing at the bottan of the preceding vessel 5 at the bottom of each vessel a gas pressure is applied higher than the gas pressure at the top of that vessel, such that practically no gas escapes from the top 6 the high gas pressure is applied at the bottom of the last vessel 7 the material at the bottom of the last vessel is discharged to the elevated pressure zone. The transport of particulate material fran a relatively low pressure zone to a relatively high pressure zone is usually done by means of a lock hopper system. By opening a first valve the material is transferred fran a storage vessel to a lock hopper.The valve is closed and the lock whopper is brought to an elevated gas pressure. A second valve, connecting the lock hopper to a vessel at elevated pressure, is then opened and the material is fed into this latter vessel and fran there to the elevated pressure zone. The second valve is then closed and the gas pressure in the lock hopper is reduced. Opening the first valve marks the beginning of a new cycle. This process is discontinuous. Moreover, the valves connecting the vessels become badly worn by the abrasive effect of the material in coibination with the frequent opening and closing. The necessitates regular replacement of these valves. The process according to the invention has the advantage that it is ccntinucus and no valves are used which would be subjected to abrasion by the material. In the process according to the invention the gas pressure is built up stagewise in a number of vessels arranged in series. The gas pressure applied at the cotton of each vessel is such that the pressure difference between the bottan and the top is too small to cause fluidi ration. This ensures that no gas, or almost no gas, escapes fran the top of the vessel, which neans that no gas, or almost no gas, needs to be supplied to the battan of the vessels in order to maintain the higher gas pressure.The stagewise pressure build up according b the invention enables relatively large pressure differences to be overcome with relatively low vessels. The material can be transported to the top of each of the vessels either pneumatically or mechanically. If it is transported pneumatically to a vessel by a carrier gas, this carrier gas itust flow continously to each vessel, which entails a high gas ccrsx3mption. The carrier gas has to be separated in the vessel from the material. This can be dcne by means of, for example, a cyclone or a filter. These problems are not present with mechanical transport. It is therefore preferable to transport the material mechanically to each of the vessels.A variety of mechanical devices can be used, such as screw conveyors, vibration conveyors or elevators. Preferably, the material is transported to the first vessel by means of an elevator. As regards the transport of the material to each of the subsequent vessels, consideration should be given to a regular discharge fram the bottam of the preceding vessel. Discharge can be regulated by means of a star valve or by a screw conveyor. Preferably, the material is discharged from the bottam of a vessel by a screw conveyor which transports the material to an elevator which in turn carries it to the top of the next vessel. It is therefore advantageous to transport the material from the bottom of each vessel to the top of the next one by means of a screw conveyor and an elevator. The discharge fram the last vessel is done mechanically or pneumatically. Which is preferable depends on the purpose for which the material is being transported to the high pressure zone. Coal powder is preferably carried to a high pressure gasifier by means of an inert carrier gas. In this case it is preferable to transport the coal powder pneumatically fran the last vessel to the gasifier. There are therefore cases in which it is preferable to discharge the material pneumatically fran the bottom of the last vessel. During the transport of the material from the top to the bottam the material particles in each of the vessels can adhere to one another and cause bridging so that the transport becomes irregular or even stops altogether. This is particularly likely to happen with fine cohesive substances. s. For this reason the material in each vessel is preferably subjected to vibration. To this end, one or more vibrators can be installed in each vessel, preferably in the side wall. The vibrators can operate continuously or intermittently. Bridging can also be prevented by keeping the material in notion in other ways, for example by means of a stirring installation or gas injection. Due to the fact that the gas pressure at the bottom of each vessel is higher than that at the top of the vessel, the gas tends to flow from the bottam to the top. This is opposed by the downward flowing material particles. It is preferable to carry out the process according to the invention such that the gas pressure at the bottan of each vessel is maintained without gas escaping fram the top and without gas being entrained with the material particles. If gas is entrained with the material, it ends up at the bottom of the last vessel and is carried away with the material to the high pressure zone. This may sometimes be undesirable.The material is therefore preferably passed to the bottom of each vessel at such a velocity that the velocity with which the material passes a certain horizontal cross section of the vessel is equal to the upward velocity of the gas relative to the material at that cross section. The gas velocity is influenced by the pressure difference over the material bed nad the height of the bed. Care is preferably taken, therefore, by maintaining the correct rate of material supply with the aid of, for example, the elevator, to ensure that the bed height of the material does not fall. To secure the pressure build up, the gas pressure in each vessel can be advantageously regulated with the aid of a ccmman pressurized gas system To this end the vessels are each connected to a Frezzurized gas line. Reducing valves enable gas at the correct pressure to be introduced into each vessel if the pressure in the vessel falls too low. In additions each vessel has a gas outlet via which gas is discharged to, for example, a gas ra processing plant if the pressure in the vessel becomes too high. Preferably, the gas lines are laid near the top of each vessel above the material bed, since gas lines located here, not being in contact with solid material, will not become polluted with solid material, even without special precautions, such as filters. It is also possible to connect just the top of the last vessel to a pressurized gas line and to connect the otter vessels to one anotber at their tops by weans of lines containing reducing valves. If the gas pressure at the top of a vessel becomes too high, gas can be led via a line and a reducing valve to the previous vessel. If the gas pressure at the top of a vessel becomes too low, gas is fed via another line with reducing valve fram the next vessel. If the material at the bottom of the last vessel is discharged by a carrier gas, a similar gas can be used in the pressurized gas system Incidentally, only a small quantity of gas will be consumed if the installation works normally, since according to the invention practically no gas escapes fram the top of each vessel. Although the process according to the invention can be used for transporting material fram a zone at any low pressure, the low pressure will generally be atmospheric. Material with a wide particle size distribution can be used in the present process.The mean particle size is not critical either. Preferably, the material has a mean particle size of 0.005 to 1.0 urn and a particle size distribution of 0.001 to 3.0 urn. An important field of application of the present invention is high pressure gasification of a solid fuel such as coal, brown coal, peat, wood, etc. Preferably, the process is applied when the material is a solid fuel and the fuel is transported at a pressure of 3,5 to 50 bar fran the last vessel to a gasification reactor where it is advantageously gasified at a pressure of 3 to 40 bar with the aid of an oxygen containing gas and or steam to synthesis gas containing mainly carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The fuel can be transported to the reactor pneumatically, e.g. by an inert gas such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide or purified synthesis gas acting as carrier gas. A gas of this sort can also be used in the pressurized gas system, if present. If the process according to the invention is used with the gasification of a fuel, air rmxst be prevented fran being carried along with the fuel fran the last vessel to the gasification reactor. This can be done by bringing the fuel fran a bunker with an inert gas atmosphere. Alternatively, the gas pressure at the bottan of the first vessel can be made so high by an inert gas that no air flows downwards and so all the air around the fuel is displaced by inert gas. In the process for transporting fuel to a high pressure gasification reactor use is preferably made of 2 to 9 vessels. At the bottan of each vessel a gas pressure is advantageously applied which is 2 to 6 bar higher than the gas pressure at the top of that vessel. The height of the vessels is preferably between 30 and 100 m. The invention also relates to a process for transporting particulate material frcm a low pressure zone to an elevated pressure zone, in which the following steps are applied 1 the material is passed fran the low pressure zone to the tap of the first one of a series of at least two vertical oblong vessels 2 the material is passed as a moving bed from the top of each vessel to the wotan thereof by gravity 3 the material is transported fran the bottom of each vessel to the top of the subsequent vessel pneumatically by means of a carrier gas 4 the gas pressure at the top of the first vessel is kept relatively low, while the gas pressure at the top of each successive vessel is kept substantially equal to the gas pressure prevailing at the bottom of the preceding vessel 5 at the bottan of each vessel a gas pressure is applied higher than the gas pressure at the top of that vessel, such that practically no gas escapes fram the top 6 the elevated gas pressure is applied at the bottam of the last vessel 7 the material at the bottan of the last vessel is discharged to the elevated pressure zone 8 the carrier gas is separated fran the material at the top of each vessel 9 the carrier gas separated fran the top of a vessel is re cycled to the bottan of an earlier vessel than the diately preceding vessel in the series. The material is transported to the top of each of the vessels pneumatically by means of a carrier gas, preferably of an inert nature such as N2 or C02. If particulate coal has to be pressurized in order to introduce it into a gasification reactor clean synthesis gas may be used as a carrier gas. This carrier gas flows continuously fran an outlet for the particulate material at the bottom of each vessel to the top of the following vessel, which could entail a high gas consumption. The carrier gas is separated at the top of the vessel fram the material. This can be done by any suitable loans, preferably by means of a cyclone and or a filter.If the separated carrier gas is vented directly into the atmosphere the volume of spent carrier gas is very great, hence the compression costs are high. Therefore separated carrier gas should be recycled as far possible. If carrier gas, separated at the top of a vessel A is recycled to the bottan of the vessel B, directly preceding vessel A, the carrier gas has to be compressed again because the pressure at the bottom of vesselB is somewhat higher than that at the top of the subsequent vessel A. In order to save compression costs the carrier gas, separated at the top of a vessel A is not recycled to the bottom of a vessel B, but to the bottom of a vessel C, which preceeds vessel B.The pressure at the bottom of vessel C is lower than that at the top of vessel A. Therefore, according to the present invention, the carrier gas separated fran the top of a vessel is recycled to the bottom of an earlier vessel than the immediately preceding vessel in the series. Preferably carrier gas fran the top s of one or more vessels is recycled to the bottom of the penultimate preceding vessel or the respective penultimate preceding vessels in the series. As regards the transport of the material to each of the suk sequent vessels, consideration should be given to a regular discharge form the bottan of the preceding vessel. Discharge can be regulated by means of a star valve or by a screw conveyor. The invention will now be explained in greater detail with reference to the schematic figures 1 and 2, to which the invention, by no means is limited. Ancillary apparatus, such as valves, compressors and purrs, is in general not shown in the figures. According to figure 1 an elevator 1 transports a particulate material continuously to the top of a vessel 2. The material flows as a moving bed to the bottom, fran which it is transported by a screw conveyor 3 to an elevator 5. The elevator 5 is housed in a closed pipe 4 which connects the vessel 2 gas tightly to a vessel 6. The material fed by the elevator 5 to the top of the vessel 6 passes down to the bottom of the vessel 6. kom there a screw conveyor 7 transports the material to an elevator 9. The elevator 9 is surrounded by a pipe 8 which connects the vessel 6 gas tightly to a vessel 10.In the same way as in vessels 2 and 6 the material in the vessel 10, brought by the elevator 9, is passed to a screw conveyor 11 in the bottom and fran there to an elevator 13. By ireans of the elevator 13 which is surrounded by a pipe 12 which connects the vessel 10 gas tightly to a vessel 14, the material is transported to the top of the vessel 14. It is passed down and at the bottom it is discharged pneumatically via a pipe 15. The carrier gas for the pneumatic transport cares via a line 16. The pressure build up is achieved and regulated with the aid of a compressed gas systeme. The carrier gas, coming via the line 16, is at the desired elevated pressure. Via a line 17 and possibly a reducing valve a pressure is applied to the top of vessel 14 such that the pressure difference between the top and bottom of vessel 14 is smaller than the pseudo hydrostatic pressure of the solid material in the vessel 14. By an appropriate choice of the downward velocity of the material it can be ensured that almost no gas flows fran the bottom to the top. Since the top of the vessel 14 is connected gas tightly by the pipe 12 to the bottom of vessel 10, the pressure prevailing there is also almost the same as at the top of vessel 14. The tops of the vessels 10 and 14 are connected to each other by a gas line 19. A reducing valve 20 in the line 19 is adjusted such that the difference between the pressure at the bottan and the pressure at the top is less than the pseudo hydrostatic pressure of the material in the vessel 10. Functioning similarly to the line 19 is a line 21 with a reducing valve 22 between the tops of vessels 6 and 10. The pressure at the bottom of the vessel 6 is almost the same as that at the top of the vessel 10 on account of the gas tight connection by the pipe 8.Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of vessel 2 is almost the same as that at the top of the vessel 6. The pressure build up is regulated with the aid of this pressurized gas system. If the pressure at the top of one of the vessels becomes too high, the pressure is vented to the set value via the line connecting the vessel with the preceding one. If this happens in vessel 6 the excess gas is discharged to a gas re processing plant not shown in the figure . If the pressure at the top of a vessel becomes too low, gas at a higher pressure is supplied via the line ccnnecting the vessel in question to the top of the next one until the pressure in the vessel has reached the correct value. According to figure 2 pressurized gas supplied through a line 1 transports a particulate material which is supplied via a rotary gas lock feeder 2 continuously fran a storage vessel 3 via a riser 4 to the top of a vessel 5. The material is first separated from the gas in a cyclone separator 6 and flows then as a moving bed to the bottom of the vessel 5, from which it is transported by a gas supplied through a line 7 to a vessel 8 via a riser 9. The gas, separated fran the material in the cyclone separator 6, is vented via a line 10, a filter 11 and a line 12.The material which has been pneumatically supplied to the top of the vessel 8 is separated fran the conveying gas in a cyclone separator 13. The separated gas is recycled via the line 1 to the connection of the riser 4 with the rotary gas lock feeder 2. The separated material flows as a moving bed to the bottan of the vessel 8, from which it is transported by a conveying gas supplied through a line 14 to the top of a vessel 15 via a riser 16. At the top of the vessel 15 the material is separated fran the conveying gas in a cyclone separator 17. The separated conveying gas is recycled from the cyclone separator 17 via the line 7 to the outlet at the bottom of the vessel 5. The separated material flows as a moving bed to the bottom of the vessel 15, frau which it is transported by a fresh high pressure conveying gas, supplied through a line 18, to the top of an ultimate vessel 19 via a riser 20. The conveying gas is separated fram the material in a cyclone separator 21 at the top of the vessel 19, and recycled via the line 14 to the outlet at the bottohn of the vessel 8.The separated material flows down as a moving bed from the top to the bottom of the vessel 19 and at the bottom it is diseharsed pneumatinally via a pipe 22. The carrier gas for the pneumatic transport comes via a line 23. The pressure build up is achieved and regulated with the aid of carpressed gas system. The carrier gas, caning via the line 23, is at the desired elevated pressure. Via the line 20 and possibly a reducing valve a pressure is applied to the top of vessel 19 such that the pressure difference between the top and bottan of vessel 19 is smaller than the pseudb hydrostatic pressure of the solid material in the vessel 19. By an appro priate choice of the downward velocity of the material it can be ensured that almost no gas flows from the bottom to the top. Since the top of the vessel 19 is connected gas tightly by the pipe 14 to the bottom of vessel 8, the pressure prevailing there is slightly lower than the pressure at the top of vessel 19.The pressure at the cotton of the vessel 5 is slightly lower than the pressure at the top of the vessel 15 on account of the gas tight connection by the pipe 7. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of vessel 3 is almost the same as that at the top of the vessel 8. The pressure build up is regulated with the aid of this pressurized gas system. If the pressure at the top of one of the vessels becomes too high, the pressure is vented to the set value via the line connecting the vessel with the penultimate preceding one. If this happens in vessel 5, the excess gas is discharged to a gas reprocessing plant not shown in the figure . If the pressure at the top of a vessel becomes too low, gas at a higher pressure is supplied via the line connecting the vessel in question to the top of the vessel following the next one until the pressure in the vessel has reached the correct value. EXAMPLE 1 In an installation, basically as described in the description of the figure, 10000 kg h of coal powder in a series of 4 vessels was brought to a pressure of 21 bar. The vessels were 85 m thigh and had a diameter of 0.56 m. Coal powder was added continuously via the elevators at a sufficient rate to maintain the height of the coal powder beds at 78.4 in. The velocity at which the coal powder was carried downwards amounted to 1.81 m s.The pressure at the bottoms of vessels 2, 6, 10 and 14 was 6, 11, 16 and 21 bar respectively.

The vessels were 85 m high and had a diameter of 0.56 m. Coal powder was added continuously via the pneumatic risers at a sufficient rate to maintain the height of the coal powder beds at 78.4 m. The velocity at which the coal powder was carried downwards amounted to 1.81 m s. The pressure at the bottoms of vessels 5, 8, 15 and 19 was 6, 11, 16 and 21 bar respectively.
