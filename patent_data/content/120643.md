# Post support.

## Abstract
A post support comprises an elongate ground engaging portion, preferably a cruciform cross section, capable of being driven vertically into the ground, and a post engaging portion attached to the ground engaging portion and in the form of a hollow box section for receiving one end of a post to be supported in a vertical position and with its axis substantially parallel to the axis of the ground engaging portion, wherein the hollow box section is formed with means, integral there with, other than means for adjusting the size of the box sec tion, for enabling an undersized post to be rigidly supported in the box section and or for removing excess post material from an oversized post. Means for removing excess material from an oversized post may comprise a bevelled edge formed on the top surface of at least one wall of the box section to present a chisel edge to a post being driven into the box section. Means for enabling an undersized post to be rigidly supported in the box section preferably comprise an upstand ing projection or plurality of projections on the inner surface of at least one wall of the box section whereby the interior dimensions of the box section are effectively reduced. Prefer ably the projections comprise vertical flanges produced by punching out a section of the wall of the box section and bending the punched section inwardly of the box section.
