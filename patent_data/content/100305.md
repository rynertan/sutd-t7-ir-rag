# A weft reservoir for fluid jet looms.

## Abstract
On a drum type weft reservoir 1 for fluid jet looms, a sin gle control pin P used for control of reservation and delivery of weft is kept, without any detection of unwind of weft under delivery, away from engagement with weft on a reservoir drum over a period of a length necessary for delivery of weft for one cycle of weft insertion, preferably in combinating with an ex pedient for barring accidental slip out of weft under delivery.
