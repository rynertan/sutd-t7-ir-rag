# ROTOR FOR ELECTRIC MOTOR

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a rotor for a permanent mag net electric motor, including a stack of rotor laminations, the stack being generally cylindrical and adapted to be secured to a rotor shaft. A plurality of arcuate permanent magnets are positioned on the peripheral surface of the stack, the mag nets being circumferentially spaced to form gaps between the adjacent side edges of the magnets. Interconnecting an chors between the laminations and the side edges are provided to secure the magnets to the stack of laminations. The rotor is made by utilizing parts that are normally discarded during the construction of the motor stator. The stator includes a stack of stator laminations, each lamination having the centerpiece thereof removed by a stamping operation for the rotor cavity. The removed centerpieces, which are normally discarded, have the rotor laminations stamped from it. After the latter stamping operation, the rotor laminations are stacked, secured to permanent magnets and mounted on a rotor shaft.
