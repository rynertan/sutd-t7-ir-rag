# Improvements in or relating to magnetic assemblies.

## Abstract
The invention comprises a magnet assembly consisting of a plurality of permanent magnets 1 each of which is wound around by a solenoid winding 4 which in use produces a field to force the permanent magnet 1 into positive or negative satu ration in dependence on the direction of the solenoid current. Thus the overall magnetic moment of the assembly can be varied stepwise. Each permanent magnet 1 comprises a bundle of rods 2, made from a magnetic material such as chromium steel. The assembly is enclosed in a casing 3 of glass reinforced plastic to make the magnet assembly buoyant but not affect the magnetic fields produced. The magnet assembly can be constructed in the form of a 3 axis magnet to produce orthogo nal magnetic fields. A number of the magnet assemblies can be connected in series to form a variable permanent magnet system producing a controllable magnetic field.
