# Labyrinth seals.

## Abstract
A bearing assembly has two relatively rotatable members 10, 12 formed with annular tongues 26, 27, 36, 37 which are interleaved to form a labyrinth passageway seal between the two members 10, 12 . At least a portion of the passageway is defined by frusto conical surfaces on the annular tongues 26, 27, 36, 37 arranged to exert centrifugal force on any foreign matter in the passageway upon relative rotation between the two members 10, 12 so as to urge the foreign matter towards the outer end of the passageway. The labyrinth passageway may comprise portions 53 which are flared in the direction to wards the outer end of the passageway, and the annular tongues 26, 27, 36, 37 on one of the members arranged ec centric or non circular so that the two members 10, 12 exert a pumping action on any foreign matter in the flared portions 53 of the labyrinth passageway upon relative rotation be tween the two members 10, 12 .
