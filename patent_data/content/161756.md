# Titanium nitride dispersion strengthened alloys.

## Abstract
To increase the creep strength of a titanium containing alloy which also contains chromium, the alloy powder is heated in the presence of ammonia at a temperature of the order of 700 C so as to form a layer of chromium nitride s on the particles and is then heated further in an inert atmosphere at a temperature between 1000 C and 1150 C to dissociate the chromium nitride s thereby effecting nitriding of the titanium to titanium nitride which affords dispersion strengthening of the alloy.
