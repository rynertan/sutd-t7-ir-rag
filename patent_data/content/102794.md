# A ONE PIECE FLEXIBLE COUPLING

## Abstract
A one piece flexible coupling for resiliently connecting coaxial driving and driven shafts 17, 18 is formed entirely from a homogeneous high temperature resistant polyurethane to provide an axially elongated body having radially enlarged axial end portions 11, 12 and a coaxial radially reduced axially extending intermediate portion 13 . A tunnel 14 extends coaxially through the body and is formed at its ends to provide splined sockets 15, 16 in said radially enlarged end portions for receiving splined ends of the driving and driven shafts respectively. The polyurethane is sufficiently hard and resistant to resilient deformation to provide essentially inelastic driving and driven engagement between the splined sockets in the radially enlarged end portions and splined ends of the driving and driven shafts. The intermediate portion is reduced radially to enable sufficient resilient yieldability to accommodate torsional shock during operation.
