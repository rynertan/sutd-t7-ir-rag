# Growth of single crystal 2PbO Fe203.

## Abstract
Single crystal 2PbO.Fe₂O₃ is grown from a fluxed melt having a selected concentration ratio of boron oxide to lead oxide and a selected concentration of iron oxide sufficient to cause 2PbO.Fe₂O₃ to crystallize yet not so much iron oxide as will cause other phases to crystallize.
