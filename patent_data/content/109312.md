# WASTE DISPOSAL APPARATUS

## Abstract
Apparatus for waste disposal comprises an inclined chute 26 for guiding waste through a wall 12 to drop into a bag 20 suspended below the chute. The bag 20 is suspended on a rim 23 by means of a resilient collar assembly 44 which grips the mouth of the bag against the rim. A cover 14 covers the bag 20, the support 22 for the bag and the end 30 of the chute, which projects beyond the wall. The cover 14 comprises a hood 16 and a body 18 and can be opened for removal of the bag and for cleaning, the bag 20 being supported in the body 18 when released from the support 22 and then slid out past the support. The upper end of the chute 26 accomodates a backless drawer 42 having a flap 38 in its front face.
