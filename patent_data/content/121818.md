# Method and device for metallizing the internal surface of a hollow object.

## Abstract
A coating of metallic material is deposited on the internal surface of a hollow object. An elongate member comprising two electrical conductors extending side by side from end to end of the member has one end inside the hollow object and its opposite end outside the object. A filament has its two ends connected to the conductors respectively at the one end of the elongate member, and a crucible containing metal to be depo sited is supported above the filament and in spaced relation ship thereto. By supplying current to the filament by way of the conductors for the filament is heated to achieve thermonic emission. The filament and the crucible are connected to nega tive and positive terminals respectively of a potential source so that electrons emitted by the filament are accelerated towards the crucible and cause the crucible to be heated by electron bombardment.
