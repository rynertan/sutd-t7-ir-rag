# Feed mechanism for elongate flexible article.

## Abstract
A feed mechanism 20 for an elongate flexible article 21 includes a pair of parallel grippers 24 , 24 reciproca ble between a first position and a second position for advancing the article 21 along a longitudinal path. The grippers 24 , 24 are closed at the first position to grip the article 21 on a pair of spaced leading end portions 21a , 21a thereof, and are opened at the second position to release the article 21 . A removal lever 30 , which has a first and a second leg 30a , 30b , is disposed adjacent to the second position and is pivotable, in response to the arrival of the grippers 24 , 24 at the second position, to project with the first leg 30a through a space between the pair of grippers 24 , 24 to kick down the article 21 from the grippers while the latter are opened.
