# ACID STABLE ALPHA AMYLASE COMPOSITION, PREPARATION AND USE THEREOF

## Abstract
A novel acid stable alpha amylase enzyme preparation comprising an Aspergillus derived alpha amylase culture medium concentrate without amyloglucosidase and transferase activities. The alpha amylase concentrate is produced by cul tivating an Aspergillus niger strain mutated to block its capability to produce amyloglucosidase and transferase whilst retaining its ability to produce alpha amylase.
