# Zinc silicate phosphors and methods for making them.

## Abstract
Improved zinc silicate phosphor particles are made by using silicic acid particles 11 of a size in the range from 0.7 to 10 micrometres coated with Mn₂O₃ xH₂O 12 and then a layer of ZnO particles 13 of a size about an order of magnitude smaller. The particles 10 are fired to form the phosphors. The particle size is held within the range prefer red and preferably is even narrower. The particles are not milled or mechanically crushed. Instead, the ZnO powder prevents agglomeration during firing. Baths are provided for formation of the particles prior to firing. Brightness and persistence are improved over conventional phosphors.
