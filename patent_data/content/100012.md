# DEVICE FOR POST DETECTION CANCELLING OF ERRONEOUS RADAR ECHOS

## Abstract
Device for cancelling false spureous radar echoes with Doppler filtering method and temporal correlations. The device allows a frequency selectivity with a memory on a plurality of antenna rotations, which is capable to distin guish false echoes from useful echoes, operating on a selective attenuation in the space of the frequency and of the time.
