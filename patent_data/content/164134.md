# COATING MATERIAL

## Abstract
There is provided a coating material made of a saponifica tion product of a modified ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer containing a cross linkable olefinically unsaturated monomer. The saponification product is characterized by its intrinsic vis cosity not greater than 0.7 dl g which is measured at 20 C using phenol containing 15 wt of water as a solvent. This polymer is readily soluble in solvents, and the resulting solution can have concentration as high as 20 to 50 wt and provide coating film which is as strong as that obtained from the con ventional EVOH having a high degree of polymerization.
