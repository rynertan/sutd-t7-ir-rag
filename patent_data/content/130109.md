## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONDERIVATIVES OF THIOPHENESULFONAMIDE, THEIR PREPARATIONAND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION FOR THE TOPICAL TREATMENTOF ELEVATED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel derivatives of phenylsulfonyl sulfinyl or carbonyl thiophene sulfonamides which are useful in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure. More particularly this invention relates to derivatives having the structural formula EMI1.1 wherein X isEMI1.2 and R1is as hereinafter defined, and the ophthalmologically acceptable salts thereof. This invention also relates to ophthalmic compositions that are employed in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure, especially when accompanied by pathological damage such as in the disease known as glaucoma.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Glaucoma is an ocular disorder associated with elevated ocular pressures which are too high for normal function and may result in irreversible loss of visual function. If untreated, glaucoma may eventually lead to blindness. Ocular hypertension, i.e., the condition of elevated intraocular pressure without optic nerve head damage or characteristic glaucomatous visual field defects, is now believed by many ophthalmologists to represent the earliest phase of glaucoma. Many of the drugs formerly used to treat glaucoma proved not entirely satisfactory. Indeed, few advances were made in the treatment of glaucoma since pilocarpine and physostigmine were introduced.Only recently have clinicians noted that many ss adrenergic blocking agents are effective in reducing intraocular pressure. While many of these agents are effective in reducing intraocular pressure, they also have other characteristics, e.g. membrane stabilizing activity, that are not acceptable for chronic ocular use. S l tert butylamino 3 4 morpholino 1,2,5 thiadiazol 3 yl oxy 2 propanol, a ss adrenergic blocking agent, was found to reduce intraocular pressure and to be devoid of many unwanted side effects associated with pilocarpine and, in addition, to possess advantages over many other ss adrenergic blocking agents, e.g. to be devoid of local anesthetic properties, to have a long duration of activity, and to display minimal tolerance. Although pilocarpine, physostigmine and B blocking agents reduce intraocular pressure, none of these drugs manifests its action by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase and, thereby, impeding the contribution made by the carbonic anhydrase pathway to aqueous humor formation. Agents referred to as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, block or impede this inflow pathway by inhibiting the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase. While such carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are now used to treat intraocular pressure by oral, intravenous or other systemic routes, they thereby have the distinct disadvantage of inhibiting carbonic anhydrase throughout the entire body. Such a gross disruption of a basic enzyme system is justified only during an acute attack of alarmingly elevated intraocular pressure, or when no other agent is effective.Despite the desireability of directing the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor only to the desired ophthalmic target tissue, no topically effective carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are available for clinical use. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A preferred embodiment of the novel compounds of this invention has structural formula EMI4.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, whereinX isEMI4.2 R1is HO only when X isEMI4.3 wherein n is 0 or 1 R is 1 C1 18alkyl, either straight or branched chain, 2 C1 18 haloalkyl, wherein halo is chloro, bromo, or fluoro, 3 R1,R2N C alkyl, wherein R1 and Rê and R ê are independently hydrogen or C1 3alkyl, or R1 and R2 are joined together to form a heterocycle selected from piperidinyl, morpholinyl, or pyrrolidinyl, 4 C1 3alkoxycarbonyl C1 5alkyl, 5 C3 6cycloalkyl, 6 C3 6cycloalkyl cl 3alkylt 7 C1 3alkyl C3 6cycloalkyl, 8 aryl, wherein aryl is a carbocycle or heterocycle such as phenyl, naphthyl, pyridinyl, furanyl, thienyl, or the like, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of C1 3alkyl, halo or C1 3alkoxy, 9 aryl C13alkyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of halo, Cl 3alkyl or C1 3alkoxy, 10 C26alkenyl, 11 C2 6alkynyl, 12 aryl C26alkenyl, 3 13 NR3 piperidinyl, wherein R is C1 3alkyl or C2 5alkanoyl, or 14 C13alkoxy C15alkyl. Representative novel compounds of this invention include those wherein the substituent group,EMI5.1 is in the 3 or 4 position of the phenyl group and R represents phenyl, ethyl, propyl, l,l dimethylethyl, heptyl, undecanyl, 4,4 dimethylcyclohexyl 2 chloro l, 1 dimethylethyl 4 methylphenyl 4 chlorophenyl 4 methoxyphenyl 4 chlorobenzyl 3 4 ethylphenyl ethyl allyl 2 propynyl 3 phenylallyl cyclopentylmethyl benzyl cyclohexyl methyl l,l dimethyl 2 dimethylaminoethyl 2 methoxycarbonyl ethyl 4 l acetylpiperidinyl and 3 pyridyl. Especially preferred are the compounds wherein XEMI6.1 R is C1 18 alkyl and moat particularly preferred are those compounds where R is C15 alkyl, either straight or branched chain.Another preferred compound is that therein R1 is OH and X isEMI6.2 It is also preferred that the hydroxy or acyloxy group be in the 4 position of the phenyl.

The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide, pyridine, acetone, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran or benzene and the like with at least an equimolar amount of a hydrohalide acceptor. Bases such as triethylamine, pyridine and the like may be employed for this purpose.

For use in treatment of conditions relieved by the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, the active compound can be administered either systemically, or, in the treatment of the eye, topically. The dose administered can be from as little as 0.1 to 25 mg or more per day, singly, or preferably on a 2 to 4 dose per day regimen although a single dose is satisfactory. When administered for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure or glaucoma, the active compound is most desireably administered topically to the eye, although systemic treatment is also satisfactory. When given systemically, the drug can be given by any route, although the oral route is preferred. In oral administration the drug can be employed in any of the usual dosage forms such as tablets or capsules, either in a contemporaneous delivery or sustained release form. Any number of the usual excipients or tableting aids can likewise be included. When given by the topical route, the active drug or an ophthalmologically acceptable salt thereof such as the sodium or potassium salt is formulated into an ophthalmic preparation. In such formulations, from 0.18 to 15 by weight can be employed. The objective is to administer a dose of from 0.1 to 10 mg per eye per day to the patient, with treatment continuing so long as the condition persists. Thus, in an ophthalmic solution, insert, ointment or suspension for topical delivery, or a tablet, intramuscular, or intravenous composition for systemic delivery, the active medicament or an equivalent amount of a salt thereof is employed, the remainder being carrier, excipients, preservatives and the like as are customarily used in such compositions. In the form of an ophthalmic solution, the active drug can be employed as ophthalmologically acceptable salts such as the sodium and potassium salts obtained by neutralizing an equivalent of the sulfonamide with an equivalent of a suitable base such as, for example, an alkali metal hydroxide. The active drug of this invention is most suitably administered in the form of ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions adapted for topical administration to the eye such as a suspension, ointment, or as a solid insert. Formulations of these compounds may contain from 0.01 to 15 and especially 0.5 to 2 of medicament. Higher dosages as, for example, about 10 , or lower dosages can be employed provided the dose is effective in reducing or controlling elevated intraocular pressure. As a unit dosage from between 0.001 to 10.0 mg, preferably 0.005 to 2.0 mg, and especially 0.1 to 1.0 mg of the compound is generally applied to the human eye, generally on a daily basis in single or divided doses so long as the condition being treated exists. These hereinbefore described dosage values are believed accurate for human patients and are based on the known and presently understood pharmacology of the compounds, and the action of other similar entities in the human eye. They reflect the best mode known. As with all medications, dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized on the basis of the disease and the response of the patient. The pharmaceutical preparation which contains the active compound may be conveniently admixed with a non toxic pharmaceutical organic carrier, or with a non toxic pharmaceutical inorganic carrier. Typical of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are, for example, water, mixtures of water and water miscible solvents such as lower alkanols or aralkanols, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, petroleum based jelly, ethyl cellulose, ethyl oleate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, isopropyl myristate and other conventionally employed acceptable carriers.The pharmaceutical preparation may also contain non toxic auxiliary substances such as emulsifying, preserving, wetting agents, bodying agents and the like, as for example1 polyethylene glycols 200, 300, 400 and 600, carbowaxes 1,000, 1,500, 4,000, 6,000 and 10,000, antibacterial components such as quaternary ammonium compounds, phenylmercuric salts known to have cold sterilizing properties and which are non injurious in use, thimerosal, methyl and propyl paraben, benzyl alcohol, phenylethanol, buffering ingredients such as sodium chloride, sodium borate, sodium acetates, gluconate buffers, and other conventional ingredients such as sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine, oleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitylate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, monothioglycerol, thiosorbitol, ethylenediamine tetracetic acid, and the like.Additionally, suitable ophthalmic vehicles can be used as carrier media for the present purpose including conventional phosphate buffer vehicle systems, isotonic boric acid vehicles, isotonic sodium chloride vehicles, isotonic sodium borate vehicles and the like. The pharmaceutical preparation may also be in the form of a solid insert. While many patients find liquid medication to be entirely satisfactory, others may prefer a solid medicament that is topically applied to the eye, for example, a solid dosage form that is suitable for insertion into the cul de sac. To this end the carbonic anhydrase inhibiting agent can be included with a non bioerodible insert, i.e. one which after dispensing the drug remains essentially intact, or a bioerodible insert, i.e. one that either is soluble in lacrimal fluids, or otherwise disintegrates. While the insert employed is not critical and those disclosed in 3,630,200 Higuchi 3,811,444 Heller et al. 4,177,256 Michaels et al. 3,868,445 Ryde et al. 3,845,201 Haddad 3,981,303Higuchi and 3,867,519 Michaels, are satisfactory in general, however, the insert described below is found preferable. For example, one may use a solid water soluble polymer as the carrier for the medicament.The polymer used to form the insert may be any water soluble non toxic polymer, for example, cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, or a hydroxy lower alkyl cellulose such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and the like acrylates such as polyacrylic acid salts, ethyl acrylates, polyacrylamides natural products such as gelatin, alginates, pectins, tragacanth, karaya, chondrus, agar, acacia the starch derivatives such as starch acetate, hydroxyethyl starch ethers, hydroxypropyl starch, as well as other synthetic derivatives such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl methyl ether, polyethylene oxide, neutralized carbopol and xanthan gum, and mixtures of said polymer. Preferably the solid insert is prepared from cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose or from other synthetic materials such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene oxide or polyvinyl methylether. Hydroxypropyl cellulose, one of the preferred polymers for the preparation of the insert, is available in several polymeric forms, all of which are suitable in the preparation of these inserts.Thus, the product sold by Hercules, Inc. ofWilmington, Delaware, under the name KLUCEL such asKLUCEL HF, HWF, MF, GF, JF, LF and EF which are intended for food or pharmaceutical use, are particularly useful. The molecular weight of these polymers useful for the purposes described herein may be at least 30,000 to about 1,000,000 or more.

Each insert is placed into a vial, which is then placed in a humidity cabinet 88 R. H. at 300C for two to four days. After removal from the humidity cabinet, the vials are stoppered and then capped. The vials containing the hydrated insert are then autoclaved at 2500F for one half hour. It is highly preferred that the solid inserts of this invention are available for use by the patient in a pathogen free condition. Thus, it is preferred to sterilize the inserts and so as insure against recontamination, the sterilization is preferably conducted after packaging. The best mode of sterilizing is to employ ionizing irradiation including irradiation emanating from Cobalt 60 or high energy electron beams. After packaging a convenient quantity of inserts, usually a single dose, the package is exposed to a sterilizing quantity of radiation. The preferred packaging employs sealing the inserts between layers of film or foil and then sealing or laminating the layers together about the edges. The techniques for performing the sterilization are well known and accepted, for example, as outlined inInternational Atomic Energy Commission, Code ofPractice for Radiosterilization of Medical Products, 1967, pp. 423 431 and Block, Disinfection,Sterilization and Preservation, 2nd Ed., Lea BR Febiger, Philadelphia, 1977, pp. 542 561. The required quantity of irradiation can be determined experimentally by testing irradiated inserts for viable bacteria. Generally, the amount of irradiation desired to achieve sterilization is defined by the D10 value. The D10 value is the radiation dose that will reduce a given population of organisms by a factor of 10. Based on D10 values, experimentally obtained for Bacillus pumilus, and presterilization contamination levels, a dose of 1.36 megarads is effective in obtaining a sterile product.
