# Hydraulic actuator control.

## Abstract
The flow of fluid to a hydraulic load 18 is controlled by controlling a bleed off path 31,32 by means of a main valve 20 responsively to the difference between a first input force produced by a force motor 52 and a second hydraulic feedback force produced by a flow sensor 74 in the passage 33 leading to the load 18 . The pressure difference across the flow sensor is applied by lines 75,76 and 71,70 to opposed feed back chambers 56,55 to act on the pilot spool 40 upon which the force motor 52 acts.
