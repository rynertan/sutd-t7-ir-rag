## Description
Description of the invention entitled PROCEDURE AND DEVICE WITll TWO STEPS OF SPEED FOR THE ATTACR MENT OF YARNS TO TUBES FITTED ONTO A TAKE UP SHAFT In the name of OFFICINE SAVIO S.p.A. at PordenoneThis invention concerns a procedure for strinping up yarn with two steps of speed and for forming a double tail of reserve yarn on the tubes at the beginning of the winding operation on a machine taking up synthetic yarns coming from .a spinneret. This invention also concerns a device able to carry out said procedure for stringinpup yarn and forming tails of re serve yard with two stepsof take up speed. The words tail of reserve yarn mean a tract or lap of yarn wound on a tube outside the yarn package, whereby said .tract of yarn serves to connect the final end of a finished yarn package to the starting end of another new yarn package without stopping the machine or the process being carried out. The words double tail of reserve yarn according to .the invention mean two tails of reserve yarn each of which Is formed at the beginning of the yarn package near each end of the tube of the yarn package, said tails being connected .to each other advantageously by a layer of yarn wound on said tube. The words stringing up the yarn mean the initial at ..tachment of yarns coming from the spinneret onto the tubes intended to take up packages of yarn. It is known that on modern winding machines which take.up synthetic yarns at a high speed it is hard to string up .or attach the yarn at once to the relative tube fitted onto the take up shaft revolving at a high working speed. To overcome this drawback the yarn is strung up with the shaft revolving at a speed much lower than the working speed, and the shaft has to keep to said lower speed during.the time needed to form the tail of reserve yarn. The tract of yarn taken up at the lower speed, however, has a yarn count substantially different from that of the yarn wound at the working speed. Said tract of yarn, there fore, represents a loss of production which has an unfavour able effect on the overall yield of the take up cycle. Various devices for forming the tail of reserve yarn .are also known. Most of the known devices, however, are suitable for .forming one or more tails of yarn in one or more circumfer . ential grooves provided outside the zone of formation of the yarn package on the surface of the tube on which the yarn package is wound. Said tails of yarn are normally arranged near an end of the yarn package, as In utility model FR A 2.370.409 and in invention FR A 2. 356,590. Devices also exist which form an initial tail of reserve .yarn at one end of the tube at the beginning of winding the. yarn package and another tail at the end of formation of the package either directly on the yarn package or at the oppos .ite end of the tube. De vices of this latter type are described in patents FR A 2.Iee.5e9 and DE A I.760.243. The Initial tails of reserve yarn thus formed are often ruined during carriage and handling of the finished yarn pa. ckages. In certain cases said tails of yarn actually become lost or are detached from the tube and form a mass of tang les yarn, so that it becomes hard to find the end of the yarn quickly during the phase of connection to the next yarn package. A R first purpose of this invention is to obtain an init lal double tail formed in one single two stage operation on the two ends of the tube bearing the yarn package, whereby said double tail is well arranged on its tube so as to eli minate the risk of said double tail becoming detached or tan gled during carriage and handling. another purpose of this invention is to obtain at the same time an immediate attachment of the yarn in a safe and effective way. It is an advantage that one single operation at the be ginning of winding provides both the stringing up of the yarn and also one tail positioned on one end of the tube and con nected by a layer of coils of the same yarn to another tail .on the other end of the tube in such a way that the interme diate layer of coils is kept firmly on the tube by the yarn package wound thereafter. This enables the tails to be reciprocally anchored to the tube and has the result that, if one tail is lacking, it Is still possible to use the remaining tail. In that case the two tails thus formed also act as a reserve for each other even if in actual practice the second tall alone consists of yarn having the same count as the yarn wound in the package. Another advantage is that the end of the yarn of the second tall can be readily seen and Identified. A A further advantage is that the attachment of the yarn takes place substantially with the first strlngipg up. Yet another advantage is that, starting from the being ning of the second tail, a well defined tract of reserve yarn Is obtained which can be used and has a count substant tally the same as the yarn in the yarn package, whereby the tract taken up at a low speed forms the first tail, while the intermediate layer between the two tails is employed advantageously to anchor said second tail to the tube. According to the invention the second tail forms the actual reserve yarn. This is obtained according to the prov cedure of the invention by the execution of the attachment of the yarn and the production of the double tail of yarn in separate phases. To be more specific, the powered roller and the shaft bearing the tubes are driven at a constant speed lower than the working speed while the yarn is being. attached to one end of the relative tube and the formation. of the first tail is being started. The winding speed is then increased progressively and at the same time the formation of the first layer of the yarn package begins with the working of the traversing de vice.. then the working speed is reached, the sideways dtspla cement of the yarn to form the second tail of reserve yarn ls stopped temporarily by cutting out the traversing system. In the next phase the yarn is displaced in the opposite direction and the formation of the yarn package is begun wlth the working of the traversing device in the pre set zone According to the invention the tract of yarn constitut ing the second tail, which is formed at the constant working speed, advantageously has a count substantially the same as that of the yarn in the yarn package. This invention, therefore, consists of a procedure to attach the yarn to tubes on which yarn packages are formed. with a double tail, stid procedure being characterized by . Including the following phases actuation of the shaft bearing the tubes and the powered. roller cooperating therewith at a speed lower than the working speed stringing up of the yarn and formation of the first tail at one end of the tube progressive increase from said lower speed until the work ing speed is reached, and sideways displacement due to the working of the traversing device during the increase in the speed of the yarn being fed along the tube the maintaining of said working speed reached on arrival near the other end of the tube, and the inversion of dis placement of the yarn after a short dwell for formation of the second tail the beginning of formation of the yarn package in the pre set zone of the tube by means of the working of the traversing device.The invention is also embodied in a device for the strinping up of yarn and the formation of a double tail of yarn on the tube, whereby said device can be fitted to a take up machine which comprises a powered tube bearing shaft, a apowered roller, means to string up the yarn, a traversing device, means to govern the speed of the shaft and the po wered roller, and also a flyer which can be driven and which is anchored to an axle lying lengthwise above the tube bearing winding shaft, said flyer being capable of being displaced along said lengthwise axle, drive means to rotate said flyer around said lengthwise axle, thrust means able to move said flyer in said lengthwise . direction, on. a first plurality of yarn guide means provided on the free edge of said flyer so as to correspond with a groove made on each tube inserted onto said winding shaft, a first tail of reserve yarn being formed in said groove, and . a second plurality of yarn guide means provided downstream from said first plurality of yarn guide means on said free edge of said flyer, whereby said second plurality of yarn guide means is able to guide the yarn onto the tube in a position near the other end of the tube during formation. of a second tail of reserve yarn, and whereby means are also included for governing the speed of the powered rol ler and take up shaft at two steps of speed. According to a preferential embodiment of this invent ion said drivable flyer has a plurality of said first yarn guide means corresponding in number to the number of tubes . borne by the winding shaft and also has a like plurality of said second yarn guide means, of which each is located in the neighbourhood of one of said first yarn guide means. The means to govern speed keep the peripheral speed of . the yarn package in formation constant by varying constantly . the winding speed as the diameter of said package varies, .and also enable the mutual transfer of power between power .ed roller and take up shaft to be reduced as much as possi .ble. . The powered roller is driven by a synchronous or asyn .chronous motor with encoder in such a way that its periphe .ral speed is strictly constant and is controlled by an in . verter. Said inverter, which can control several or only one powered roller, links the powered rollers to each other strictly In such a way that, if several take up units are . lined up together side by side, there are no problems as re . gards differences in speed. Said shaft that has the task of taking up the yarn pro ducked, of which the peripheral winding speed has to be con. stant, has to reduce the number of its revolutions as the diameter of the yarn package increases. So as to carry out the above, the shaft is driven by . an asynchronous motor plus encoder or by a D.C. motor the . speed of which is regulated by an inverter or D.C. actuator receiving its control from electronic speed control means. Said means to control speed serve to regulate speed and to keep to a minimum the exchange of power between po . we red roller and shaft. In particular said means to control speed are able to control both the powered roller and the take up shaft at variable or constant speeds. be shall describe hereafter a preferential embodiment of the invention as a non restrictive example and shall re fer to the tables, wherein Fig.I gives a front view of the device of the invention Fig.2 gives a rear view of the drivable flyer of the in Invention Fig.3 shows a section along the line A A of FIg.I so as to illustrate the means which rotate said drivable flyer Fig.4 shows a section along the line B B of Fig.I so as to illustrate a part of the means which thrust the drivable flyer. In the figures the same parts or parts performing the same functions bear the same reference numbers. Rhe figures give the following 100 is the winding ma chine or take up group 12 is the device to form the double tail of reserve yarn on the tubes of the yarn packages and forms the subject on this invention 14 is a part of the .winding machine IOO on which is fixed the device I2 of the invention 15 is the powered tube bearing shaft of the wind .ing machine 100 115 is the powered roller. . The electronic means which control the speed of the shaft 15 and powered roller 115 are not shown nor is the . stringing up device shown since said device is known and does not enter into the scope of this invention. Said shaft 15 arranges for the winding of the yarns on . .to their respective tubes 116. 16 is the plurality of tubes inserted onto the tube bearing shaft of the winding machine, .the relative yarns 216 being wound onto said tubes to form..the yarn packages 116. 20 is a drivable flyer which is anchored at one edge . to to the shaft 21 with screws. 21 is a rotating shaft lying parallel to and above the. .tube bearing shaft 15 of the winding machine 100. . Said shaft 21 can move along its own axis, being driven .by thrust means 27 which enable it to run inside a group .that rotates the flyer 22, and inside the support 28. Said shaft 21 can also be revolved around its own axis by means which cause rotation and are located in the group ..22. Said group 22 causing rotation comprises a support 122. within which the shaft 21 runs. and also means 23 which act .uate the rotation of the shaft 21 around its own axis. Said means 23 consist, in our example, of a double .acting pneumatic jack of which the stem 24 is equipped with..a rack 25 that acts on the pinton 26 machined on the end of. the shaft 21. Said jack 23 is fed through the ducts I23 223. In said support 122 are machined the cylinder 222 in . which the piston 23 runs, and also the lengthwise bore 225 for the stem 25 and the crosswise bore I26 in which the group oved portion 26 of the shaft 21 runs. Said pinion 26 is machined on the shaft 21 over a length greater than that of the maximum travel of the shaft 21 so . as to permit coupling with the rack 25 at any time during the traversing of the shaft 21. The group 22 is fixed to the element 14 with screws, which in our example are two cheese headed screws with a hexagonal socket. 27 are the thrust means which drive the shaft 21 along. Its axis. Said thrust means consist here of a pneumatic jack 127. Said pneumatic jack 127 in our example is secured to .the element 14 with said support 28 and is provided with a stem 29 connected at its end to the shaft 21 by means of an attachment 30 which allows said shaft 21 to revolve. Said support 28 has the shape of an angle bracket. The. horizontal wing of the support 28 is anchored to the element .14 with screws, whereas the uprIght wing provides for the clamping of the jack 27. . 32 is the plurality of yarn guide seatings machined .like a U shaped notch in the free edge of the flyer 20. At the beginning of the travel of the shaft 21 said .yarn guide seatings 32 lie in a position corresponding to . that of the relative grooves 62 made on the tubes 16 insert .ed onto the tube bearing shaft 15 of the winding machine 100. Said seatings 32 guide the yarns during formation of the first tails 162 of yarn on the tubes 16 of the yarn pa ..cages 116. Inducting slopes 132 134 respectively are provided near each yarn guide seating 32 24 on the free edge of the flyer..20 and are able to constrain the relative yarn 216 to enter.the relative neighbouring seating. 34 Is the plurality of yarn guide seatings machined like a step shaped notch on the free edge of the flyer 20. At the end of the travel of the shaft 21 said yarn puide seatings 34 lie in a position corresponding to that of the relative positions 64 provided for the formation of the second relative tails 164 of yarn on the tubes 16 insert ed onto the tube bearing shaft 15 of the winding machine IQO. Said seatings 34 guide the yarns during formation of said second tails 164 of yarn on the tubes 16. With further. reference to the figures, 114 is a traversing device and is equipped with one yarn guide block 214 for each tube, there by said block 214, by means of the crosswise movement impos ed on it between the two ends of the relative tubes, deter mines the sideways displacement of the yarn 216 along the . tract of tube 16 on which it is wished to form the yarn package 116. Let us now look at the method of functioning. She device I2 of the invention which forms the tails of yarn only works during the starting phases of winding the yarn . onto the tubes 16 and after the stringing up or attachment. of the yarns to the relative tubes. First of all, the winding machine is started up. The . electronic control means govern the take up shaft 15 and .powered roller 115 to an initial stringing up speed slower. than the working speed. At this point the stringing up device is actuated and arranges for the fixture of the ends of the yarns 216 onto. their relative tubes 16. After the ends of the yarns have been secured on their.respective tubes 16 revolving at a slow speed, the device . I2 of the Invention is started by actuating the piston 23 . of the group 22 that rotates the flyer 22 said piston 23 . causes an interaction between the rack 25 and the pinion 26 of the shaft 2I said interaction causes rotation of said shaft 21 and therefore the raising of the flyer 20. As a result of the raising of the flyer 20 the yarns 216 going down onto their relative tubes 16 come into con . tact with the free edge of the flyer 20 and slide into the. yarn guide seatings 32 owing to the effect of an inducting. slope 132 located on the edge of the flyer 20 near each yarn guide seating 32. Said yarn guide seatings 32 now lie in a position corresponding to that of the grooves 62 provided on the tubes. 16 inserted onto the tube bearing shaft 15 and in this way, after about 0.7 0.8 of a second, a first tail of yarn of the yarn package is formed on each tube 16. At the end of formation of the first tail the electronic control means intervene to increase the speed of the tube bearing shaft 15 and the speed of the powered roller 115 at the same time. This Increase takes place advantageously In a gradual. manner so as not to break the yarns, which, at the beginning of the increase in speed, are moved from the flyer 20 into. the traversing zone and are delivered, when said flyer 20 ts lowered by the pneumatic means 23, to the relative yarn guides 214 of the traversing device 114, which proceeds to.form the. intermediate tract of yarn on the tubes. then the working speed has been reached and is then .maintained by the electronic control means, the pneumatic . means 23 are actuated once more and cause a new rotation of the shaft 21 and therefore a new raising of the flyer 20 and a new release of the yarns from the relative yarn guide s of the traversing device 114. Then, without any interruption of the winding, the thrust means 27 are actuated once again to make the flyer . 20 slide lengthwise. then said sliding has ended, said yarn guide seatings 34 located on the edge of the flyer 20 lie in positions cor responding to the relative positions 64 provided on the tu . bes 16 inserted onto the tube bearing shaft 15.After about 0.7 0.8 of a second the second tail 164 . of yarn of the yarn package is formed on each tube 16. then the second tail has been formed, there will be a sideways movement in the opposite direction until the traver sing device starts then the lowering of the flyer 20, the . delivery of the yarns to the relative yarn guides 214 of the traversing system 114 and the return of the flyer 20 to its. position of rest, as at the beginning of the cycle, will lead to the actual formation of the yarn packages 116 with the help of the traversing system 114 equipped with yarn guide blocks 214. . To sum up, after the stringing up of the yarns and du ring the whole working cycle of the device IS of this invent ion the winding of yarn on the tubes 16 is never stopped. Owing to the guiding action of the device of this in Invention said winding causes the formation of a first tail 162 of yarn in an appropriate groove 62 on one end of each tube 16, said tail 162 being formed at a slow take up speed as compared to the working speed. . Then, with a sequence of movements during the accelerat ion of the take up means, the device of the invention perm its the formation of an intermediate tract of yarn on each tube and, after the working speed has been reached, the for mation of a second tail of yarn on the other end of each tube 16 at an appropriate position 64 which lodges the coils forming said second tail 164. . Lastly, the device 12 returns to its position of rest while formation of the actual yarn package goes on with the .help of the traversing system. The yarn composing the second tail is wound at the constant working speed and therefore has a count the same as that of the yarn package and thus constitutes the actual. reserve of yarn. We have described here a procedure and a preferential .but not restrictive embodiment for carrying out said proce .dure, but variants are possible for a technician in this field. Thus the shape, proportions and sizes can be changed . and it is possible to envisage only one set of yarn guide seatings and therefore to accomplish the displacement of the yarn from one end to the other with only one movement .it is possible to provide the device for any desired number of simultaneous yarn feeds it is possible to replace the pneumatic means with hydraulic, mechanical or other means. These and other variants are possible without departing thereby from the scope of the invention.
