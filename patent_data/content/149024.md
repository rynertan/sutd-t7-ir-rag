# Surface coated wear resistant member of cermet and process for producing same.

## Abstract
A surface coated wear resistant member of cermet which includes a substrate of cermet and a hard coating vapor deposited on a surface of the substrate. The coating is composed of at least one titanium compound selected from the group consisting of titanium carbide, titanium nitride, carbo nitride of titanium, oxy carbide of titanium, oxy nitride of titanium and oxy carbo nitride of titanium. An atomic ratio of one of carbon, nitrogen, carbon plus nitrogen, carbon plus oxygen, nitrogen plus oxygen and carbon plus nitrogen plus oxygen to titanium Ti in the coating is in the range of between 0.3 and 0.8. The coating contains a compound of TiX and a compound of Ti₂X wherein X is one of carbon and nitrogen or at least two of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. The coating may further includes titanium metal. The coating having an average thickness of 1 to 10 µm. There is also disclosed a process for producing such a surface coated wear resistant member.
