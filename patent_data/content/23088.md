# Process for the interconversion of crystalline forms of ethylene bis stearamide.

## Abstract
A process for preparing alpha and beta crystalline forms of N, N ethylene bis stearamide EBS . Heating of EBS at temperatures of 120 C 160 C to melt the EBS results in formation of 95 alpha which when cooled to 40 C or less remains in the alpha state, but upon reheating to about 80 C results in 95 conversion to the beta crystalline form. Heating of the alpha crystalline form at temperatures ranging from about 45 90 C for selected periods of time results in mixtures of alpha and beta.
