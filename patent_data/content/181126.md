# Signal synthesiser.

## Abstract
A signal synthesiser is provided for producing pulses simulating characteristics of echo pulses generated during ultrasonic scanning so that the simulated pulses can be used in the calibration of equipment for processing the outputs of ultrasonic transducers. The synthesiser produces an en velope signal of selectively variable amplitude 51 and rise 50 and fall 52 time and multiplies this envelope respectively with a high frequency pulse train and a substan tially zero amplitude signal in a dual matched multiplier 66 so that the subtractively combined outputs of the multiplier are free of unwanted feed through components introduced by the multiplier. Means provided for effecting phase shift of pulse train with respect to envelope.
