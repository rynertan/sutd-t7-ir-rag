# Dimensionally heat recoverable article.

## Abstract
A dimensionally heat recoverable article 1 carrying a thermoplastic polymeric material 5 and a heat softenable adhesive 4 of smaller thickness and lower softening or melting point than the polymeric material 5 is used to encapsulate objects such as joints in cables. The heat softenable adhesive 4 allows low installation temperature while the polymeric material 5 allows excellent cycling performance to be maintained. The article may be in the form of a wrap around sleeve.
