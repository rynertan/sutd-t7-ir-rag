# Semiconductor lasers.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser 30 is provided with an external reflector 35 on a differential expansion mount 32, 34 to compensate temperature dependence so as to provide single mode operation over a restricted temperature range, operation over a wider temperature range with mode hop ping restricted to single jumps, operation at constant fre quency over a more restricted temperature range, or opera tion over an extended temperature range without mode hopping.
