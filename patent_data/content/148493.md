# Thermoplastic modified epoxy compositions.

## Abstract
Described herein is a composition which contains bis 2,3 epoxycyclopentyl ether, a specific group of hardeners and a specific group of thermoplastics. When cured, these compositions have improved tensile properties as compared to similar compositions which do not contain thermoplastics.
