# A releasable lock mechanism.

## Abstract
A releasable lock mechanism is provided in combination with a stationary first member 11 and a second member 14 , the latter being adapted to assume various selected positions of rotary adjustment with respect to the first member 11 . The lock mechanism includes a first lock component 15 carried by one of the members and a complemental pivotally adjust able second lock component 17 carried by the other member. The second member 14 is disposed at a selected position of rotary adjustment with respect to the first member 11 , and retains the second member 14 in the selected posi tion. The second lock component 17 is adapted to be manu ally shiftable relative to its pivotal axis and away from the peripheral pocket of the first lock component 15 to effect unlocking of the lock components 15,17 . The locking mechanism is particularly suitable for locking the rear end of a truck or similar vehicle to a loading dock during loading and unloading.
