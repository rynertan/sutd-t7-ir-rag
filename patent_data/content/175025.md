# Decaffeination process.

## Abstract
The process described herein improves the decaffeina tion of both wet and dry green coffee beans with a liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide extractant by dissolving di methyl sulfoxide in the extractant prior to contact with the beans. Rates of extraction are greatly improved, especially in the preferred mode where the dimethyl sulfoxide is em ployed at near saturation levels.
