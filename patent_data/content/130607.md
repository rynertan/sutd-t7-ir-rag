# Use of alkylaluminum compounds and hydroxyl containing compounds to initiate polymerization of ethylene with chromium oxide catalysts.

## Abstract
A method for smoothly and reliably initiating polymer ization of ethylene with a supported chromium oxide cata lyst, with smaller amounts of catalyst and in substantially shorter periods of time then heretofore required, by adding an alkylaluminium compound and a hydroxyl containing compound to the reactor of a polymerization reaction sys tem prior to the commencement of polymerization and sub jecting said alkylaluminium compound and hydroxyl con taining compound to suitable conditions of temperature and pressure for a time sufficient for said alkylaluminium com pound to react completely with the moisture present in said reactor and said hydroxyl containing compound.
