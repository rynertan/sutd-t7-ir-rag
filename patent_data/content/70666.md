# OPTICAL INSPECTION SYSTEM

## Abstract
An optical inspection system for the inspection of circular workpieces 1 includes an electronic camera 6 having an optical system 21 for focusing an image of a circular workpiece 1 on an electronically active image receiving surface 23 , means 16 to move the circular workpiece 1 into a predetermined position in the field of view of the optical system 21 of the camera 6 . When a conventional electronic camera is used to inspect circular workpieces it is very difficult to analyse the output signal from the camera since it corresponds to chords taken across the workpiece 1 . To overcome this the present inspection system includes means 7 for scanning the image receiving surface in directions extending substantially radially across the image receiving surface to produce an output signal, and a signal analyser 12 arranged to monitor the output signal corresponding to each radial scan to detect the presence of any irregularity in the workpiece.
