# Speed detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A counter 12 is provided to count an output pulse which a pulse generator 5 generates each time a vehicle moves by a predetermined distance. A microprocessor 2 is provided to actuate a timer 11 in synchronism with the leading edges of the output pulse from the pulse generator 5 . The timer 11 is set to a constant time interval during which the speed of the vehicle is to be detected. The microprocessor 2 calculates the speed of the vehicle from the count of the counter 12 which count is a value during the time interval from when the timer 11 starts to operate to when the pulse generator 5 generates a pulse just before or after the end point of the set time interval. Thus, the speed of the vehicle can be detected with good resolution and precision.
