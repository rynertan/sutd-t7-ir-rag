# Gas line sealing method utilizing penetrating flexible sealant.

## Abstract
A method of sealing leaking gas pipe joints by injecting a catalyzed acrylic monomer composition into the leaking joint and curing the composition in the joint to seal the leak is characterized in that the composition when cured has a glass transition temperature which is no more than 0 C and is at least about 5 C below the minimum pipe joint operating temperature. Suitable sealants are mixture of long chain monoacrylic esters, hydroxy functional acrylic esters, acid monomers, plasticizers and polyfunctional acrylic esters.
