# Coating composition containing polymeric surfactant.

## Abstract
A coating composition comprising a A graft copolymer, having surfactant properties, comprising the reaction product of i a vinyl copolymer comprising vinyl chloride, a vinyl carbo xylate ester, and a source of hydroxyl groups, such that the hy droxyl content prior to reaction is about 0.5 to about 8 by weght of the vinyl copolymer and of which about 1 to about 75 of said hydroxyl groups have been reacted with ii an an hydride copolymer comprising the reaction product of an aro matic monomer and a dicarboxylic acid anhydride, such that the graft copolymer has a molecular weight of about 2,000 to about 30,000, and a vinyl copolymer anhydride copolymer weight ratio of about 20 to about 2, of which a sufficient num ber of carboxyl groups have been hydrolyzed to produce sur factant properties b a dispersible powder, c optionally, other hard resins, d optionally, a rubbery polymer, e optionally, a supplemental surfactant, all mixed in an organic solvent.
