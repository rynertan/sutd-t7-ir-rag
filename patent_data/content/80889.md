The compounds useful in the compositions and method of the present invention have been evaluated for herbicidal activity but, depending on concentration and rate of application, it is contemplated that these compounds and their compositions will also find utility as plant growth regulators. The liquid herbicidal compositions of this invention, including concentrates which require dilution prior to application to the plants, typically contain from about 2 to about 98 parts by weight of at least one active ingredient of this invention, that is, a phosphonoalkanoic acid or ester or salt thereof, and from 0 to about 50parts by weight, preferably 0 to about 25 parts by weight, and more preferably 0 to about 5 parts by weight of an inert adjuvant in liquid or solid form, for example, a wetting agent, emulsifying agent, dispersant or any combination thereof, and from about 4.5 to about 94.5 parts by weight of inert liquid extender, e.g., water, all parts being by weight of the total composition. Where required, from about 0.1 to about 2 parts by weight of the inert liquid extender can be replaced by a corrosion inhibitor or antifoaming agent, or both.Lower or higher levels of active ingredient and adjuvant can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Water dispersible powder compositions can be made containing one or more active ingredients, an inert solid extender and an inert adjuvant, for example, one or more wetting and dispersing agents. The inert solid extenders are typically of mineral origin such as the natural clays, diatomaceous earth and synthetic minerals derived from silica and the like. Examples of such extenders include kaolinites, attapulgite clay and synthetic magnesium silicate. The water dispersible powders of this invention typically contain from about 2 to about 98 parts by weight of at least one active ingredient of this invention, fromO to about 25 parts, preferably 0 to about 5 parts, by weight of wetting agent, from about 0.25 to about 25 parts by weight of dispersant and from about 4.5 to about 94.5 parts by weight of inert solid extender, all parts being by weight of the total composition.Where required, from about 0.1 to about 2 parts by weight of the solid inert extender can be replaced by a corrosion inhibitor or anti foaming agent or both. Aqueous suspensions can be prepared by mixing together and grinding an aqueous slurry of a water insoluble active ingredient of this invention in the presence of dispersing agents adjuvants to obtain a concentrated slurry of very finely divided particles. The resulting concentrated aqueous suspension is characterized by its extremely small particle size, so that when diluted with an inert liquid extender and sprayed, coverage is very uniform. Emulsifiable oils are typically solutions of active ingredient in water immiscible or partially waterimmiscible solvents together with an inert adjuvant which is typically a surface active agent. Suitable solvents for the active ingredient of this invention include hydrocarbons and water immiscible ethers, esters or ketones.Emulsifiable oil compositions typically contain from about 2 to about 98 parts active ingredient, about 1 to about 50 parts surface active agent and about 4 to about 94 parts solvent, all parts being by weight based on the total weight of emulsifiable oil. The herbicidal compositions of this invention, particularly the liquids and soluble powders, preferably contain as an inert adjuvant, one or more surface active agents in amounts sufficient to render a given composition readily dispersible in water or in oil. The incorporation of a surface active agent into the compositions greatly enhances their efficacy. By the term surface active agent it is understood that wetting agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents and emulsifying agents are included therein. Anionic, cationic and nonionic agents can be used with equal facility.It has been observed by those skilled in the art that increased degrees of pene tration of the plant leaves are experienced with increasing concentrations of surfactant in the compositions and thus higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Preferred wetting agents are alkyl benzene and alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sulfated fatty alcohols, amines or acid amides, long chain acid esters of sodium isothionate, esters of sodium sulfosuccinate, sulfated or sufonated fatty acid esters, petroleum sulfonates, sulfonated vegetable oils, polyoxyethylene derivatives of phenols and alkylphenols particularly isooctylphenol and nonylphenol and polyoxyethylene derivatives of the nonhigher fatty acid esters of hexitol anhydrides e.g., sorbitan . Preferred dispersants are methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium lignin sulfonates, polymeric alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthalene sulfonate, polymethylene bisnaphthalenesulfonate and sodium N methylN long chain acyl taurates. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, N.Y. The denser diluents are preferred to dust. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide , 2nd Edn.,Interscience, New York 1950. Solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at OOC, McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , AlluredPubl. Corp., Ridegwood, N.J., as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chemical Publ.Co., Inc. New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. The compositions are prepared by admixing the active ingredient with an adjuvant including diluents, extenders, carriers and conditioning agents to provide compositions in the form of finely divided particulate solids, pellets, solutions, dispersions or emulsions.From the viewpoint of economy and convenience, water is the preferred diluent. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, and the like. Granules and pellets may be made by spraying The active material upon preformed granulacarriers or by agglomeration techniques.See J. E. Browning, Agglomeration , Chemical Engineering, Dec. 4, 1967, pp. 147 170, and Perry s Chemical Engineer s Handbook, 4th Edn., McGraw Hill, N.Y., 1963, pp. 8 59 through 8 61. For further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example G. C. Klingman, Weed Control as a Science , John Wiley Sons, Inc., New York, 1961, pp. 81 96 J. D. Fryer and S. A. Evans, Weed Control Handbook , 5th Edn. Blackwell Scientific Publications,Oxford, 1968, pp. 101 103. Although compositions of this invention can also contain other additaments, for example, fertilizers, phytotoxicants and plant growth regulants, pesticides and the like used as adjuvants or in combination with any of the above described adjuvants, it is preferred to employ the compositions of this invention alone with sequential treatments with the phytotoxicants, fertilizers and the like for maximum effect. For example, the field could be sprayed with a composition of this invention either before or after being treated with fertilizers, phytotoxicants and the like. The compositions of this invention can also be admixed with the other materials, e.g., fertilizers, phytotoxicants, and the like, and applied in a single application. Chemicals useful either simultaneously or sequentially in combination with the active ingredients of this invention include, for example, triazines, ureas, carbamates, acetamides, acetanilides, uracils, phenols, thiolcarbamates, triazoles, benzoic acids, nitriles and the like. Fertilizers useful in combination with the active ingredients include, for example, ammonium nitrate, urea, potash, and superphosphate. In accordance with the method of the present invention, effective amounts of the compounds of the pre sent invention are applied to above ground portions of plants. The application of liquid and particulate solid herbicidal compositions to above ground portions of plants can be carried out by conventional methods, e.g., rope wicks, power dusters, boom and hand sprayers and spray dusters The term plant as used herein means terrestrial plants. The term terrestrial plant is inclusive of germinating seeds, emerging seedlings and herbaceous vegetation including the roots and above ground portions, as well as established woody plants. The application of an effective amount of the compounds of this invention to the plant is essential and critical for the practice of the present invention. The exact amount of active ingredient to be employed is dependent upon the response desired in the plant as well as such other factors as the plant species and stage of development thereof, and the amount of rainfall as well as the specific compound employed. In foliar treatment for the control of vegetative growth, the active ingredients are applied in amounts from about 1 to about 50 or more pounds per acre, preferably about 2 to about 30 pounds per acre. An effective amount for herbicidal control is that amount necessary for overall or selective control, i.e., a herbicidal amount. It is believed that one skilled in the art can readily determine from the teachings of this specification, including examples, the approximate application rate. Although the invention is described with respect to specific embodiments the details thereof are not to be construed as limitations except to the extent indicated in the following claims.
