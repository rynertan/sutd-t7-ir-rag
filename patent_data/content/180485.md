# Black corrosion resistant coating.

## Abstract
A black corrosion resistant coating composition which is applied to a metal substrate as a wet film and heated to dry and initiate curing to provide a protective coating tenaciously bonded to the substrate. The composition has a corrosion inhibiting powdered metal, a black pigment of manganese dioxide and a primary bonding titanate polymer which, when heated, undergoes a hydrolysis reaction producing an inor ganic titanium dioxide bonding of the coating to the sub strate. Improved film integrity and adhesion of the wet coat ing prior to the hydrolysis reaction is provided by a secon dary organic resin. Preferably the coating composition also has thixotropic, metal suspension and hygroscopic agents. All of the constituents are dispersed in a vehicle of active and inactive solvents.
