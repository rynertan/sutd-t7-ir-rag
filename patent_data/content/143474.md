# Apparatus for reading an optically readable record carrier.

## Abstract
A compact disc digital audio player may be adapted to read optical audio discs in which digital information is stor ed by controlling the time base correction circuit in this player by means of a clock signal whose frequency is not a constant reference frequency but a frequency which is lock ed to the time base of the signal being read. As a result of this both the data signal and the subcode will have the same time base without the necessity of modifying the integrated circuits available for the compact disc digital audio player.
