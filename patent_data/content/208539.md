## Description
FOLDING DISULFIDE CROSS LINKABLE PROTEINS This invention relates to a process for folding proteins, to give folded proteins containing disulfide cross links, in vitro. A critical feature of a biologically active protein is its conformation. When proteins are synthetised in vitro, they do not have the structure characteristic of the native, folded protein. Finding the correct native conformation is to a degree a matter of trial and error however, the relatively rapid folding of proteins in vivo implies that there is a pathway of folding involving only relatively few intermediate species. Overall, the folding process is driven by the greater thermodynamic stability of the native form. Under normal conditions in vivo, folding occurs very rapidly. In bacteria, refolding typically occurs in a few minutes. The recent developments of recombinant technologies permit considerable amplification of the amount of specific proteins synthetised, but the folding of proteins can be slow. This often results in inclusion bodies containing unfolded, or partially folded, protein. For proteins containing disulfide crosslinks disulfide proteins this problem is particularly severe since bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, which are commonly used as a recombinant host, are not adapted to the processes of sulfhydryl oxidation to the disulfide form. A number of studies of refolding of disulfide proteins have clarified the folding process as one of the successive formation i.e., disulfide interchange of specific disulfides. Kinetically, the efficiency of the overall process is limited by this interchange step. Several studies using low molecular weight thiols to catalyze this process i.e., cysteine, glutathione have defined optimal concentrations of oxidized and reduced thiol compounds. Rates observed are greatly improved relative to air oxidation, but such conditions still leave much to be desired for industrial scale processes. Such processes require obtaining adequate yields at reasonable times and protein concentrations. Thus, the goal in a protein folding process is to effectively fold the protein by not only increasing the rate of the reaction, but also by using greater protein concentrations without sacrificing yields. Perhaps the most commercially important protein containing disulfide bonds is insulin. U.S. Patent 4,421,685 discloses a process for producing insulin wherein the S sulfonated form of the A chain and the S sulfonated form of the B chain are reacted with a thiol reducing agent under specific conditions to form insulin. Thiol reducing agents disclosed therein are dithiothreitol DTT and dithioerythritol DTE . The use of S sulfonated proteins in the refolding of recombinant proteins is a common industrial process. See U.S. Patent 4,421,685. The use of sulfonated proteins allows for greater solubility and protects sulfhydryl groups during protein purification. In the presence of a limited amount of reductant, refolding is efficient with the protein thiosulfonate acting as a mixed disulfide intermediate. Most of the described processes use DTT, glutathione, or beta mercaptoethanol as the reductant. Brief Summary of the Invention The subject invention concerns an improved process for folding proteins containing disulfide crosslinks. The process has particular utility in recombinant DNA processes wherein proteins, or portions thereof, are produced by constructed microbes. The invention process comprises reacting an unfolded and reduced protein with an effective protein folding amount of oxidized thioredoxin, or an oxidized thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptide, alone, or in combination with oxygen, or a thioredoxin reductase regenerating system, to produce folded protein.The invention process also comprises reacting a scrambled protein where incorrect disulfide bonds have been formed i.e., the protein is folded but in the wrong conformation, with only a fraction being active with an effective concentration of oxidized and reduced thioredoxin, or oxidized thioredoxin and a chemical reducing agent such as dithiothreitol. Detailed Disclosure of the Invention Unfolded protein containing disulfide crosslinks can be efficiently folded by reacting the unfolded and reduced protein with an effective protein folding amount of oxidized thioredoxin, or an oxidized thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptide, alone, or in combination with oxygen or a thioredoxin reductase regenerating system. Scrambled proteins can be correctly folded by reacting them with an effective protein folding amount of reduced thioredoxin or a reduced thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptide, alone, or in combination with oxidized thioredoxin or an oxidized thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptide. The unfolded or scrambled protein can be in a crude cell extract, or partially purified from a crude cell extract, for example, from a recombinant organism. The concentration of thioredoxin or one of the thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptides which can be used in the invention process ranges from about 5 to about 500 mu M. The optimal concentration for oxidized intact bacterial thioredoxin appears to be at least 500 mu M and 10 mu M for reduced thioredoxin. It should be recognized that the precise level of thioredoxin or thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptide can be readily ascertained for a particular protein by a person skilled in the protein art having possession of the subject invention. Thioredoxin at a concentration of 5 500 mu M catalyzes the refolding of denatured and reduced bovine pancreatic RNase 22 160 mu M to give quantitative recovery of enzymatic activity. The rate of refolding was approximately fifteen fold greater than air oxidation. With thioredoxin, 50 activity was recovered after 30 hr with 100 mu M and 8 hr with 500 mu M compared to 120 hr required using air oxidation. Thioredoxin was 1000 times more effective than oxidized dithiothreitol. Thioredoxin at mu M concentrations resulted in the same kinetics of refolding as mM concentrations of oxidized DTT. When DTT 20 mM and various concentrations of thioredoxin were added to the sample, there was an additional increase in the appearance of activity. This increase was constant for all thioredoxin concentrations, suggesting that the effects are synergistic. The time required for 50 reactivation of RNase T1 2 in the presence of 100 mu M thioredoxin was decreased three fold with the addition of oxygen. The T1 2 for 100 mu M thioredoxin and air was 23 hr. With the addition of oxygen the T1 2 was lowered to 8 hr. This is comparable to the T1 2 of 500 mu M thioredoxin in the presence of air. The effective concentration of thioredoxin can be reduced by a factor of five with the addition of oxygen. The oxygen effect does not occur in the absence of thioredoxin. There is an initial increase in the rate of refolding without thioredoxin, but the recovered activity levels off at 12 after 5 hr. In the presence of a regenerating system of thioredoxin reductase and a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide derivative, for example, NADP oxidized form , there was an increase in the rate of refolding of RNase with 100 mu M thioredoxin. The T1 2 was decreased from 23 hr to 5 6 hr with thioredoxin reductase and either 0.1 or 1.0 mM NADP . Thioredoxin efficiently catalyzes the rearrangement of disulfide bonds in scrambled, inactive RNase at pH 7.4 to yield a quantitative recovery of active enzyme. Reduced thioredoxin at a concentration of 10 mu M had a T1 2 of 8 hr. Optimal conditions for reactivating scrambled RNase consisted of a mixture of oxidized and reduced thioredoxin at a ratio of 10 1, respectively. The T1 2 values for 100 mu M, 150 mu M and 200 mu M thioredoxin at a ratio of 10 1 oxidized to reduced were 5, 2 and 1.5 hr, respectively. Neither air norDTT alone were effective in reactivating scrambled RNase, with a recovery of less than 30 activity. Thioredoxins are low molecular weight dithiol proteins that have the ability to reduce disulfides in typical organic compounds such as Elman s reagent or disulfides as they exist naturally in a variety of proteins Holmgren, A. 1981 Trends in Biochemical Science, 6, 26 39 . Thioredoxin and thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptides within the scope of the subject invention are exemplified by the following compounds 1 thioredoxin isolated from Escherichia coli Laurent, T.C., Moore, E.C., and Reichard, P. 1964 J. Biol. Chem., 239, 3436 3445 2 thioredoxins isolated from other sources, e.g., thioredoxin isolated from yeast Porque, G.P., Baldesten, A., and Reichard, P. 1970 J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci.USA, 75, 5827 5830 3 thioredoxin derived dithiol peptides representing peptides produced by cleavage of intact thioredoxins, as described in Example 2, infra. One such example of this class of thioredoxin derived peptides is the fragment containing residues 1 through 37 i.e., T1 37 produced by cyanogen bromide cleavage of thioredoxin from E. coli. The important feature of these thioredoxin derived, and thioredoxin like, dithiol peptides is that they contain the redox active peptide sequence, Cys X Y Cys Lys, wherein X and Y can be any of the 20 amino acids. For example, the redox active peptide sequence from E. coli thioredoxin is Cys Gly Pro Cys Lys Cys cysteine, Gly glycine, Pro proline, Lys lysine and 4 thioredoxin like dithiol peptides that have the intrinsic ability to catalyze the reduction of protein disulfides.These thioredoxin like dithiol peptides will generally have the characteristic of containing a pair of cysteine residues which form a redox active disulfide. This example includes peptides, derived from natural sources or constructed synthetically, that include the same redox active peptide sequence disclosed above, for example, as in E. coli thioredoxin, Cys Gly Pro Cys Lys, or analogous sequences from other thioredoxins such as that encoded for by T4 bacteriophage, Cys Val Tyr Cys Cys cysteine, Val valine, Tyr tyrosine Soderberg, B O, Sjoberg, B M, Sonnerstam, U., and Branden, C I 1978 Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci. USA, 75, 5827 5830 .Other thioredoxin like peptides include the class of seed proteins called purothionins that have intrinsic thioredoxin like activity Wada, K. and Buchanan, B.B. 1983 in Thioredoxins, Structure and Function Gadal, P., ed , Editions du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique . Examples of proteins containing disulfide crosslinks are insulin, proinsulin, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease RNase , lysozyme, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, interferon, rennin, plasminogen activator, prolactin, human alpha 1 trypsin inhibitor, Factor VIII, and the like. The above proteins, and others containing disulfide crosslinks, can be used in their S sulfonated form as starting material in the invention disclosed herein. When the S sulfonated form of the protein is used, reduced thioredoxin is added to the folding process. Materials and Methods used in the examples disclosed infra are as follows Materials Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A RNase , cytidine 2 3 cylcic monophosphate and oxidized and reduced dithiothreitol DTT were obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, MO. 3 N morpholine propane sulfonic acid MOPS sodium salt, was the Ultrol grade from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. Sephadex G 25 40 was also obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals used were reagent grade. Thioredoxin is purified either from a commercial source of E. coli, strain B Grain Processing Corp., Minneapolis, MN or from any of a number of common strains of E. coli grown by standard procedures Pigiet, V. and Conley, R.R. 1977 J. Biol. Chem., 252, 6367 6372 . The protein is purified using standard procedures including chromatography on ion exchange and molecular seive columns Williams, C. H., Zanetti, G., Arscott, L.D., and McAllister, J.K. 1967 J. Biol. Chem. 242, 5226 5231 McEvoy, M., Lantz, C., Lunn, C.A., and Pigiet, V. 1981 J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6646 6650 . Thioredoxin protein is assayed immunologically using quantitative rocket immunoelectrophoresis as described in McEvoy et al., supra. Concentration and Activity of RNase A Enzyme concentration of native RNase was determined using an extinction coefficient of 9800m 1 cm 1 measured at 277.5 nm Hantgan, R.R., Hammes, G.G. and Scheraga, H.A. 1974 Biochemistry 13 3421 3431 . The concentration of the fully reduced enzyme was determined at 275 nm using an extinction coefficient of 9200M 1 cm 1 Anfinsen, C.B., Haber, E., Sela, M. and White, F.H., Jr. 1961 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 47 1309 1315 . The activity of RNase A was determined according to the procedure of Crook et al. Crook, E.M., Mathias, A.P. and Rabin, B.R. 1960 Biochem. J. 74 234 238 . The final assay mixture consisted of 0.1M MOPS, pH 7.0, 7mM cytidine 2 3 cyclic monophosphate and 10 30 mu g ml RNase A. The increase of the absorbance at 291 nm upon the hydrolysis of cytidine 2 3 cyclic monophosphate at 25 DEG C was monitored. Following are examples which illustrate the process of the invention, including the best mode. These examples should not be construed as limiting. All solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted. Example 1 Denaturation and Refolding. Reduction and denaturation of RNase was performed by incubating overnight 30 mg of the native enzyme in 1.5 ml of 0.1M Tris HCl, pH 8.6 containing 0.15M DTT and 6M guanidine.HCl. The reduced RNase was separated from excess DTT and guanadine.HCl by column chromatography using a 1 cm x 24 cm Sephadex G 25 superfine column equilibrated and developed with 0.01N HCl. Rudolph, R. and Fuchs, I. 1983 Hoppe Seyler s Z. Physiol. Chem. 364, 813 820. Fractions of 0.3 ml were collected and the absorbance at 280 nm was monitored. Those fractions containing RNase A were pooled, the concentration determined, and the material stored under argon frozen at 20 DEG C. Reoxidation of RNase A was initiated by diluting the reduced enzyme in 0.1M Tris, pH 7.4 with 1 mM EDTA containing various amounts of thioredoxin and or oxidized DTT. At various times aliquots were assayed and the percentage of refolding calculated. The results were as follows Thioredoxin, oxidized DTT, and a mixture of both increased the rate of refolding of RNase as compared to air oxidation. The time required to obtain 50 reactivation T1 2 of RNase 310 mu g ml was decreased approximately 15 fold as compared to air oxidation. For air oxidation the T1 2 was 120 hr compared to 55 hr for 20 mu M thioredoxin, 45 hr for 50 mu M, 35 hr for 100 mu M and 8 hr for 500 mu M. With thioredoxin, 100 of RNase activity was recovered after 30 90 hr while air oxidation would require at least 200 hr. At lower concentrations of thioredoxin there was a lag in the reactivation of RNase between 10 20 hr. This lag was not observed in the presence of oxidized DTT. The most likely explanation is that DTT was more effective in some early kinetic step, perhaps an oxidation of disulfides inaccessible to the much larger thioredoxin molecule. When oxidized DTT was used as the oxidant, similar results were observed. The T1 2 for 20 mM DTT was 70 hr, while for 50 mM DTT it was 40 hr, and for 100 mM it was 30 hr. The values are comparable to those of thioredoxin at concentrations of 20, 50, and 100 mu M. Thioredoxin is therefore 1000 times more effective than oxidized DTT. There is no observed increase in the rate of refolding using oxidized DTT at concentrations greater than 80mM. At these concentrations oxidized DTT is not very soluble and the reaction mixture may be saturated. A mixture of thioredoxin and oxidized DTT was more effective than either component and no lag phase was observed. At a thioredoxin concentration of 20 mu M the T1 2 was lower by 15 hr with the addition of 20 mu M DTT. In summary, at low concentrations i.e., 20 mu M , thioredoxin is more effective than DTT. A mixture of both is more effective than either component alone. At all concentrations of thioredoxin, the T1 2 is decreased by an average of 10 hr with the addition of 20mM oxidized DTT. This suggests that DTT and thioredoxin may be influencing the oxidation of different disulfides. As the concentrations of either DTT or thioredoxin increase, the difference between the samples diminishes. Example 2 Use of Thioredoxin and Oxygen to Refold RNase. Renaturation of RNase was initiated by diluting the reduced enzyme in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5 with 1 mM EDTA to a final concentration of 340 mu g ml. Oxidized thioredoxin 100 mu M was added to half of the samples. All samples were stirred constantly at room temperature and a continuous stream of oxygen was run over the samples. The control samples were exposed to air. At various times aliquots were removed, assayed for RNase activity, and the percent of reactivation was calculated. The time required for 50 reactivation of RNase T1 2 in the presence of 100 mu M thioredoxin was decreased three fold with the addition of oxygen. The T1 2 for 100 mu M thioredoxin and air was 23 hr. With the addition of oxygen the T1 2 was lowered to 8 hr. This is comparable to the T1 2 of 500 mu M thioredoxin in the presence of air. The effective concentration of thioredoxin can be reduced by a factor of five with the addition of oxygen. The oxygen effect does not occur in the absence of thioredoxin. There is an initial increase in the rate of refolding without thioredoxin, but the recovered activity levels off at 12 after 5 hr. Example 3 Use of Thioredoxin and Thioredoxin Reductase to Refold RNase. Thioredoxin reductase was obtained from IMCO Stockholm, Sweden or isolated according to the procedure of Pigiet and Conley Pigiet, V. and Conley, R.R. 1977 J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6367 6372 . NADP was obtained from Sigma St. Louis, MO . Refolding of RNase was initiated by diluting the denatured RNase in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5 or 0.05 M Tris, pH 9.0, each containing 1 mM EDTA. The regenerating system consisted of a catalytic amount of thioredoxin reductase and an excess 1 to 10 mM of NADP . The thioredoxin concentration remained constant at 100 mu M. Aliquots were removed at various times and assayed for RNase activity. In the presence of the above regenerating system of thioredoxin reductase and NADP there was an increase in the rate of refolding of RNase with 100 mu M thioredoxin. The T1 2 was decreased from 23 hr to 5 6 hr with thioredoxin reductase and either theta .1 or 1.0 mM NADP . Example 4 Thioredoxin Fragments T1 37 and T19 36. a Production of T1 37 by Cyanogen Bromide Cleavage A sample of E. coli thioredoxin was dialyzed in water for 12 hr at 4 DEG C. Five ml was dried and resuspended in 70 formic acid. Cyanogen bromide Sigma Chemical was dissolved in 70 formic acid and added to thioredoxin in a 50 fold molar excess of methionine. The solution was purged with nitrogen and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 24 hr. At the completion of the cleavage reaction the solution was dried under nitrogen, resuspended in sodium acetate buffer and adjusted to pH 8.5 with ammonium hydroxide. Samples were loaded onto a Waters mu Bondapak C 18 column Trademark of Waters Associates, Inc., Milford, MA attached to a Beckman Model 421 system Trademark of Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA monitored at 214 nm. The solvent system employed was 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid Buffer A and 0.08 trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile Buffer B . A gradient from 0 to 60 B over 30 min was used to separate the peptides at a flow rate of 2 ml min. Thioredoxin was cleaved by CNBr into two fragments, T1 37 and T38 108, eluting at 44 and 51 buffer B, respectively. Amino acid analysis identified and confirmed the composition of both peptides. Holmgren, A. and Reichard, P. 1967 Eur. J. Biochem. 2, 187 196 . T1 37 contained the active site of the enzyme. The two peptides recovered accounted for 69 of the starting material. Unreacted thioredoxin accounted for 12 15 of the loss, while HPLC separation may be responsible for the additional losses. b Production of T19 36 by Trypsin Cleavage After HPLC separation, described above, T1 37 was pooled, dried, and resuspended in sodium acetate buffer and adjusted to pH 8.0 with NH4OH. An aliquot of trypsin Sigma Chemical was added to the incubation at 1 w w of peptide concentration. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 DEG C for 1 hr. Separation of trypsin fragments was done by HPLC as for the cyanogen bromide fragments. Trypsin digestion of the T1 37 peptide yielded two peptides, T4 18 and T19 36, which were resolved by HPLC, eluting at 31 and 45 in buffer B, respectively. Amino acid analysis revealed that the species eluting at 31 B contained 15 amino acids and corresponds to the active site peptide, T19 36. Incubation of 90 nmoles of T1 37 produced 80 nmoles T19 36 after separation by HPLC with a yield of 88 . Example 5 Upon substituting the thioredoxin in Examples 1, 2 and 3 with the thioredoxin fragments T1 37 or T19 36 obtained in Example 4, there is obtained essentially the same results. Example 6 Upon substituting oxidized thioredoxin or an oxidized thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptide, alone, or in combination with oxygen or a thioredoxin reductase regenerating system, for the DTT or DTE in the examples of U.S. Patent 4,421,685, there is obtained an improved yield of the desired insulin. Example 7 Upon substituting any disulfide protein or S sulfonated disulfide protein for the bovine pancreatic ribonuclease of Examples 1, or 2, or 3, or 5, there are obtained comparable beneficial protein folding results. Example 8 Upon reacting an unfolded protein whose disulfide crosslinks have been reduced, with a mixture comprising an effective protein folding amount of oxidized thioredoxin or an oxidized thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptide and a thiol reducing agent selected from the group consisting of dithiothreitol and dithioerythritol, there is obtained an enhanced folding of said protein. Example 9 Upon reacting an unfolded S sulfonated disulfide protein with a mixture comprising an effective protein folding amount of reduced thioredoxin or a reduced thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptide and a thiol reducing agent, for example, dithiothreitol or dithioerythritol, there is obtained an enhanced folding of said protein. Example 10 Use of Thioredoxin to Refold Scrambled RNase Scrambled RNase was produced by oxidation under denaturing conditions of the reduced and denatured RNase isolated as described above. The pooled fractions from the Sephadex G 25 column were made 6 M in guanidine.HCl and the pH adjusted to pH 8.6 with solid Tris. Oxygen was then bubbled through for several minutes and the sample was incubated at room temperature protected from light for 3 4 days. The amount of free thiol determined by the method of Ellman Ellman, G.L. 1959 Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 82 70 77 was less than 0.05 mole per mole of RNase. The activity was about 5 , indicating that the majority of refolded RNase was in an incorrect and inactive form. Reactivation of scrambled RNase was initiated by diluting the inactive RNase into 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4 with 1 mM EDTA containing various amounts of oxidized thioredoxin preincubated with reduced DTT 30 min prior to addition. At various times, aliquots were assayed, and the percentage of reactivation was calculated by comparison of the specific activity with native RNase as previously described. Thioredoxin efficiently catalyzes the rearrangement of disulfide bonds in scrambled, inactive RNase at pH 7.4 to yield a quantitative recovery of active enzyme. Pre reduction of oxidized thioredoxin with reduced DTT was required to stimulate reactivation using this oxidized substrate. At 100 mu M thioredoxin, the optimal level of DTT was 10 mu M. Higher levels of DTT inhibited reactivation probably by shifting the protein thiol disulfide balance toward the reduced form. The optimal oxidized thioredoxin to reduced DTT was 10 1. When this ratio remained constant and thioredoxin concentration was increased, an increase in the rate of reactivation was observed. The T1 2 values for 150 mu M and 200 mu M thioredoxin were 2 hr and 1.5 hr respectively compared to 5 hr for 100 mu M. The T1 2 using 100 mu M thioredoxin and 10 mu M DTT was 5 hr, compared to 27 hr using thioredoxin in the refolding of reduced RNase. Reduced thioredoxin at a concentration of 10 mu M was also effective in catalyzing the rearrangement of disulfide bonds in scrambled RNase with a T1 2 of 8 hr. Neither air or DTT alone were effective in this reactivation reaction with a recovery of only 15 activity with air and 30 activity with DTT after 10 hr, compared to 75 reactivation with thioredoxin in the same time period. The effective protein folding amount of reduced thioredoxin or a reduced thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like, dithiol peptide is about 5 to about 20 mu M. Also, the effective protein folding amount of reduced and oxidized thioredoxin is, advantageously, maintained at a ratio of reduced to oxidized forms of about 1 1 to about 1 20. Reduced thioredoxin is formed by preincubating oxidized thioredoxin and DTT in the folding mixture, as described above. Example 11 Refolding of Sulfonated RNase with Thioredoxin Thioredoxin efficiently catalyzed the refolding of sulfonated RNase at pH 8.0 to yield a quantitative recovery of active RNase. Sulfonated RNase was prepared by the method of Thannhauser and Scheraga Thannhouser, T.W. and Scheraga, H.A. 1985 Biochemistry 24 7681 7688 . Reduced thioredoxin was required and the optimal conditions were a 1 1 molar ratio of thioredoxin to the protein thiosulfonates 8 1 molar ratio thioredoxin to RNase . When the ratio was decreased to 1 2 thioredoxin to protein thiosulfonates, both the rate of reactivation and the final yield of RNase activity decreased. At a 1 1 ratio, the T1 2 time required for 50 recovery of activity was 3.5 hr and the final yield of RNase was 100 . When thioredoxin was decreased two fold, the T1 2 increased to 8 hr and the recovery of RNase activity was only 65 . At a ratio of 1 20 thioredoxin to protein thiosulfonates, no reactivation above control was observed. Example 12 Upon substituting the thioredoxin in Example 11 with the thioredoxin fragments T1 37 or T19 36 obtained in Example 4, or other thioredoxin derived, or thioredoxin like dithiol peptides in the reduced form, there is obtained essentially the same results.
