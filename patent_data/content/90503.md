# APPARATUS AND METHOD OF PACKAGING A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
A method of packaging a semiconductor device during which leads 312, 313 are lanced from a bar pad 3 7 of the lead frame 310 . The leads 312, 313 of the lead frame 310 remain within one plane and the bar pad 317 is displaced to a different plane in order to provide the neces sary separation between the ends of the leads 312, 313 and the bar pad 317 to prevent accidental connections. A region of reduced mechanical strength is provided laterally across each lead to allow the leads to be bent after the smiconductor device and the portions of the leads adjacent to the semiconductor device are encapsulated with a plastic enclosure. At least some leads have an enlarged area within the encapsulated portion of the leads to secure and anchor the leads within the plastic forming the encapsulating enclosure.
