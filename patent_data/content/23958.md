# Free rotor gas bearing gyroscope having electro magnetic rotor restraint and acceleration output signal and method of operating a gyroscope.

## Abstract
A two degree of freedom, free rotor, gas bearing gyro scope having greatly reduced sensitivity to acceleration induced and other disturbances. An electromagnetic forcer 42 acts on the rotor 22 to keep the axial component of bearing deflection negligible. Closed loop control circuitry for energizing the axial forcer responds to a linear displacement signal. The circuitry also provides an output signal propor tional to the component of acceleration along the spin axis. This signal may be used to replace an accelerometer output signal in navigation equipment. In addition to being func tional during normal operation, the control functions during start up and shutdown to center the rotor over the support ball 16 . The functions of forcer and torquer are combined in a single structure. A dual motor arrangement 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 and a dual forcer torquer arrangement provide cancellation of bias variations due to housing, shaft, and bearing deflections. The ball support shaft 18 has larger diameter and the gas fill pressure is lower than would be feasible in the absence of the electromagnetic axial forcing.
