# Tobacco smoke filter element with alkali ferrate supported on granular material.

## Abstract
Alkali, e.g. potassium, ferrates as impregnating substances for inert gas permeable granular support materials, e.g. polyethylene or a zeolite optionally admixed with activated carbon or activated alumina which may be impregnated, for instance, with sodium permanganate and a basic sodium compound , are disclosed the resulting impregnated materials may be used as additives for general use, especially treating fluids or fluid suspensions to selectively remove at least part of an undesirable constituent. One particular undesirable constituent which may be at least partly selectively removed from a fluid or fluid suspension by means of the impregnated materials is hydrogen cyanide and this is of special importance for treating, e.g., tabacco smoke.
