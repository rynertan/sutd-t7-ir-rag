## Description
This invention relates to a novel random copolymer comprising at least polymerized units from ethylene and polymerized units from a cycloolefin as monomers, and a process for production thereof. More specifically, it relates to a cycloolefin type random copolymer having excellent transparency, thermal resistance, heat aging resistance, chemical resistance, solvent resistance, dielectric properties and mechanical properties and a narrow molecular weight distribution. Polycarbonate, poly methyl methacrylate and poly ethylene terephthalate are known as synthetic resins having excellent transparency. The polycarbonate resin has excellent heat resistance, heat aging resistance and impact strength as well as excellent transparency, but have the defect of poor chemical resistance whereby it is readily attacked by strong alkalies. Poly methyl methacrylate has the defect that it is susceptible to attack by ethyl acetate, acetone and toluene, is swollen in ether, and has low heat resistance. Polyethylene terephthalate has excellent heat resistance and mechanical properties but has the defect of possessing weak resistance to strong acids or alkalies and being susceptible to hydrolysis. Many of polyolefins well known as general purpose resins have excellent chemical resistance, solvent resistance and mechanical properties, but have poor heat resistance. Furthermore, they have poor transparency because they are crystalline. The transparency of polyolefins is generally improved by adding a nucleating agent to render the crystal structure fine, or by performing quenching to stop the growth of crystals, but such measures have not proved to be entirely effective. Rather, the addition of a third component such as the nucleating agent is likely to impair the inherent excellent properties of the polyolefins. Furthermore, the quenching method requires large scale equipment, and is also likely to reduce heat resistance or rigidity with a decrease in crystallinity. On the other hand, methods have been proposed for producing polymers having superior transparency by copolymerizing ethylene with bulky comonomers. U.S. Patent 2,883,372 discloses a copolymer of ethylene with 2,3 dihydrodicyclopentadiene. This copolymer has a well balanced combination of rigidity and transparency but low heat resistance as shown by its glass transition temperature of about 100 C. Japanese Patent Publication No. 14,910 1971 discloses a process for producing a homo or co polymer having polymerized units represented by the following formula a Homo or co polymers comprising the 1,4,5,8 dimethano 1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a octahydronaphthalene as part or the whole of monomers and methods for production thereof are also disclosed in Japenese Laid Open Patent Publications Nos. 159,598 1975, 127,728 1983, 51,911 1984, 81,315 1984 and 81,316 1984 and U.S. Patent 4,178,424. The polymers disclosed in these prior art documents are ring opened polymers having polymerized units resulting from ring opening of monomers as in the polymerized units represented by formula a . As can be understood from the formula a , these ring opened polymers are structurally characterized by the fact that the main polymer chain contains an unsaturated vinyl linkage. Because of the presence of the unsaturated vinyl linkage, these polymers have poor heat aging resistance. All of the polymers described in the above prior art documents are ring opened polymers obtained by the ring scission of monomer. U.S. Patents 3,330,815 and 3,494,897 and Journal of Polymer Science Polymer Physics Edition, volume 12, 1607 1618 1974 describe polymers of the type obtained by the opening of the double bond of monomer without the ring scission of the bicyclohept 2 ene skeleton of the monomer.

Table II of this document shows a copolymer of ethylene containing 1 mole of polymerized units derived from the same compound as formula f named octahydrodimethanonaphthalene in this document . Table IV thereof states that this copolymer has a beta relaxation temperature of 15 C. The copolymers described in these prior art references which contain only 2 at the largest of octahydrodimethanonaphthalene have a glass transition temperature of about 15 C at the highest. They strongly exhibit a rubbery nature and have poor heat resistance and mechanical properties.

In formula I , R⁹ and R¹⁰ are identical or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbn atoms. Alternatively, R⁹ and R¹⁰ are bonded to each other to form a group of the following formula When n is 0 in formula I , the cycloolefin of formula I may be represented by the following formula I 1 Examples of the cycloolefin of formula I including formulae I 1 and I 2 include bicyclo 2,2,1 hept 2 ene, 6 methylbicyclo 2,2,1 hept 2 ene, 5,6 dimethylbicyclo 2,2,1 hept 2 ene, 1 methylbicyclo 2,2,1 hept 2 ene, 6 ethylbicyclo 2,2,1 hept 2 ene, 6 n butylbicyclo 2,2,1 hept 2 ene, 6 i butylbicyclo 2,2,1 hept 2 ene, 7 methylbicyclo 2,2,1 hept 2 ene, tricyclo 4,3,0,1 The compounds of formula I may be used singly or in combination. The compounds of formula I can be easily produced by condensing cyclopentadienes with the corresponding olefins by the Diels Alder reaction. According to the process of this invention, the cycloolefin of formula I is copolymerized continuously with ethylene in a hydrocarbon medium in the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst is one formed from a soluble vanadium compound and an organoaluminum compound. In the copolymerization reaction carried out continuously, the atomic ratio of aluminum atoms to vanadium atoms, Al V, is maintained at at least 2. The soluble vanadium compound used in this invention as a component of the catalyst is a vanadium compound soluble in the hydrocarbon medium in the polymerization reaction system. It may include vandium compounds represented by the general formula VO OR Compounds having at least one Al C bond in the molecule can be used as the organoaluminum compound as a catalyst component.

Among these, the alkyl aluminum halides, alkyl aluminum dihalides and mixtures of these are especially preferred. The copolymerization reaction in accordance with the process of this invention is carried out in a hydrocarbon medium. Examples of the solvent include aliphatic hydrocarbons having 5 to 15 carbon atoms such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane and kerosene alicyclic hydrocarbons having 5 to 15 carbon atoms such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and aromatic hydrocarbons having 6 to 15 carbon atoms such as benzene, toluene and xylene. These solvents may be used singly or in combination. In the process of this invention, the copolymerization reaction is carried out continuously. During the reaction, the ratio of aluminum atoms to vanadium atoms, Al V, is maintained at 2 or higher, preferably 2 to 50, especially preferably 3 to 20. The soluble vanadium compound and the organoaluminum compound are fed to the reaction system usually after dilution with the hydrocarbon medium. The concentration of the vanadium compound to be fed to the polymerization reaction system is usually not more than 10 times, preferably 7 to 1 times, more preferably 5 to 1 times, that in the polymerization reaction system. On the other hand, the organoaluminum compound may be fed to the polymerization system after its concentration is adjusted to not more than 50 times that in the polymerization system. In the process of this invention, the concentration of the soluble vanadium compound in the copolymerization reaction system is usually 0.01 to 5 gram atoms liter, preferably 0.05 to 3 gram atoms liter, as vanadium atoms. In the process of this invention for producing the cycloolefin random copolymer, the copolymerization reaction may be carried out in the copresence of an electron donor in the polymerization reaction system in addition to the soluble vanadium compound and the organoaluminum compound as catalyst ingredients. Examples of the electron donor include oxygen containing electron donors such as alcohols, phenols, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters of organoc acids or inorganic acids, ethers, acid amides, acid anhydrides and alkoxysilanes, and nitrogen containing electron donors such as ammonia, amines, nitriles and isocyanates. The copolymerization reaction is carried out usually at 50 to 100 C, preferably 30 to 80 C, more preferably 20 to 60 C. The average residence time in the copolymerization reaction differs depending upon the type of the polymerization material, the concentrations of the catalyst components, and the polymerization temperature. Usually it is 5 minutes to 5 hours, preferably 10 minutes to 3 hours. The pressure during the copolymerization reaction is usually more than 0 to 50 kg cm², preferably more than 0 to 20 kg cm². If desired, it is carried out in the presence of an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. To control the molecular weight of the copolymer, a molecular weight controlling agent such as hydrogen may be present in the reaction system. The polymerization reaction mixture after the copolymerization is treated in accordance with conventional methods to give the desired cycloolefin random copolymer. The mole ratio of ethylene cycloolefin fed to the copolymerization reaction system in the process of this invention is usually from 99 1 to 1 99, preferably 98 2 to 2 98. In this invention, the cycloolefin is copolymerized with ethylene. As required, another copolymerized unsaturated monomer within a range which does not impair the objects of the invention, for example in an amount of 50 mole , preferably 40 mole , based on the ethylene units in the copolymer may be copolymerized in addition to these two essential components. Specific examples of the other copolymerizable unsaturated monomer include alpha olefins having 3 to 20 carbon atoms such as propylene, 1 butene, 4 methyl 1 pentene, 1 hexene, 1 octene, 1 decene, 1 dodecene, 1 tetradecene, 1 hexadecene, 1 octadecene, 1 octadecene and 1 eicosane which are to be used in an amount of less than 1 mole per mole of the ethylene units in the resulting random copolymer and cycloolefins such as cyclopentene, cyclohexene, 3 methylcyclohexene, cyclooctene, 3a,5,6,7a tetrahydro 4,7 methano 1H indene, non conjugated dienes such as 1,4 hexadiene, 4 methyl 1,4 hexadiene, 5 methyl 1,4 hexadiene, 1,7 octadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene and 5 vinyl 2 norbornene, and norbornenes such as norbornene 2, 5 methylnorbornene 2, 5 ethylnorbornene 2, 5 isopropylnorbornene 2, 5 n butylnorbornene 2, 5 chloronorbornene 2, 2 fluoronorbornene 2, and 5,6 dichloronorbornene 2. The copolymerization reaction in accordance with this invention can be advantageously carried out by continuously feeding ethylene, the cycloolefin, and optionally the other copolymerizable component as materials to be polymerized, the soluble vanadium compound and organo aluminum compound as catalyst components, and the hydro carbon medium into the polymerization system, and continuously withdrawing the polymerization reaction mixture from the polymerization reaction system. According to the continuous process of this invention, a random copolymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution and good transparency can be produced. The resulting copolymer solution continuously withdrawn from the polymerization reaction system is a hydrocarbon medium solution of the random copolymer. The concentration of the random copolymer in the resulting copolymer solution is usually 2.0 to 20.0 by weight, preferably 2.0 to 10.0 by weight. Contacting the resulting copolymer solution with a ketone or alcohol gives a precipitate of the random copolymer. The precipitate is separated by such separating means as filtration or centrifugal separation to give the random copolymer of this invention. The proportion of the ketone or alcohol used is usually 200 to 1,000 parts by weight, preferably 300 to 500 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the resulting copolymer solution. Examples of the ketones are those having 3 to 7 carbon atoms such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, dipropyl ketone and acetylacetone. Examples of the alcohols are alcohols having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, sec butanol and tert butanol. The ketones or alcohols may contain a small amount of water. The use of a mixture of the ketone or alcohol with usually 0.1 to 10 by weight, preferably 1 to 5 by weight, of water is suitable since it gives a copolymer powder having low contents of the unreacted cycloolefin monomer and a low molecular weight polymer and high bulk density. Contacting of the resulting copolymer solution with the ketone or alcohol is carried out with stirring at a temperature of usually 0 to 100 C, preferably 10 to 70 C, especially preferably at a temperature near the boiling point of the ketone or alcohol. This is effected by using a vessel type mixer having agitating vanes such as turbine blades and comb blades. The rotating speed of the blades is usually 200 to 2,000 rpm, preferably 800 to 1,500 rpm. As a result of the after treatment described above, the random copolymer is precipitated usually in powder form to form a suspension. The suspension containing the copolymer is separated into the copolymer and the mother liquor by such a separating means as centrifugation or filtration. The separated copolymer is further extracted with a ketone to give a random copolymer having low contents of the unreacted cycloolefin monomer and a low molecular weight polymer, a narrow molecular weight distribution, a narrow composition distribution, and a high glass transition temperature. The proportion of the ketone used in the extraction is such that the concentration of the copolymer in the ketone is usually 10 to 100 g liter, preferably 30 to 60 g liter. The temperature at which the copolymer is contacted with the ketone is usually 10 to 85 C, preferably 15 to 80 C. The contacting treatment between the copolymer and the ketone is usually carried out with stirring using, for example, a vessel type mixer having agitating blades such as turbine blades and comb blades. The rotating speed of the blades at this time is usually 50 to 400 rpm, preferably 100 to 200 rpm. The time required for contacting is usually 1 to 8 hours, preferably 2 to 5 hours. Examples of the ketone may be the same as those exemplified for the ketone used for the precipitation treatment. The copolymer which has been contacted with the ketone may be separated by such separating means as centrifugation or filtration. As required, the separated copolymer is further washed with the ketone. The washing conditions may be the same as the ketone contacting treatment conditions described above. The random copolymer of this invention obtained by the above after treatment has a bulk density of usually 0.05 to 0.3, preferably 0.1 to 0.25, and is characterized by the ease of handling at the time of molding. Furthermore, since the copolymer of this invention have low contents of the unreacted cycloolefin monomer and a low molecular weight polymer, optical materials, particularly optical memory discs, molded from it permit reduction of noises caused by diffused reflection, etc. Thus, the present invention gives the random copolymer in which the mole ratio of polymerized units from ethylene is in the range of from 3 97 to 60 40. When n in formula I is 0, the above mole ratio is preferably from 10 90 to 60 40, more preferably from 15 85 to 50 50. When n in formula I is a positive integer, the mole ratio is preferably from 5 95 to 50 50. The cycloolefin of formula I is incorporated in the chain of the random copolymer of this invention as polymerized units of the following formula II The random copolymer of this invention has an intrinsic viscosity η , measured in decalin at 135 C, of 0.01 to 20 dl g, preferably 0.05 to 10 dl g. The random copolymer of this invention has a molecular weight distribution w n , measured by gel permeation chromatography GPC , of not more than 4, preferably not more than 3.5, especially preferably not more than 3. The random copolymer of this invention is characterized in that this molecular weight distribution is narrow. This means that the random copolymer of this invention has a low content of a low molecular weight polymer. Accordingly, when the random copolymer of this invention is molded into an optical material such as an optical memory disc or optical fibers, the optical material has good surface smoothness, low surface tack, or good mechanical properties and is suitable for optical applications. The random copolymer of this invention has a crystallinity, measured by X ray diffractometry, of 0 to 10 , preferably 0 to 8 , especially preferably 0 to 7 . The advantage of the copolymer having a crystallinity of 10 or below is that when it is molded into an optical material such as an optical memory disc or optical fibers, noises of the optical material caused by refraction, diffused reflection, etc. are reduced. Where n is 0 in formula I , the random copolymer of this invention has a glass transition temperature Tg of preferably 10 to 130 C, mor preferably 20 to 100 C. When n is a positive integer in formula I , the copolymer has a Tg of preferably 10 to 240 C, more preferably 20 to 200 C. The novel random copolymers in accordance with this invention are molded by known methods. For example, they can be extrusion molded, injection molded, blow molded, or rotationally molded by using, for example, a vent type extruder, a twin screw extruder, a conical twin screw extruder, a Cokneader, a plsticator, a mix truder, a twin conical screw extruder, a planetary screw extruder, a gear type extruder, a screwless extruder, etc. In the molding process, known additives such as heat stabilizers, light stabilizers, antistatic agents, slip agents, antiblocking agents, antihaze agents, lubricants, inorganic and organic fillers, dyes and pigments may be used as required.

Ethylene and 1,4,5,8 dimethano 1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a octahydronaphthalene Table 1, a abbreviated as DMON were copolmerized in a 2 liter polymerization reactor equipped with agitating blades. The polymerization reactor was continuously charged at its top with a cyclohexane solution of DMON at a rate of 0.4 liter hour so as to provide a DMON concentration of 60 g liter in the polymerization reactor, a cyclohexane solution of VO OC₂H₅ Cl₂ as a catalyst at a rate of 0.7 liter hour so as to provide a vanadium concentration of 0.7 mmole liter in the polymerization reactor the concentration of vanadium fed at this time was 2.86 times that in the polymerization reactor , a cyclohexane solution of ethyl aluminum sesquichloride as a catalyst at a rate of 0.4 liters hour so as to provide an aluminum concentration of 5.6 mmoles liter in the polymerization reactor, and 0.5 liters hr of cyclohexane. In the meantime, the polymerization mixture in the polymerization reactor was withdrawn continuously from the bottom of the polymerization reactor so that the amount of the polymerization mixture in the reactor was always kept at 1 liter. Furthermore, 80 liters hr of ethylene, 80 liters hr of nitrogen and 0.2 liter hr of hydrogen were fed from the top of the polymerization reactor. The copolymerization was carried out at 10 C by circulating a cooling medium into a jacket fitted to the exterior portion of the reactor. As a result of the copolymerization reaction under the above conditions, a polymerization reaction mixture containing the ethylene DMON random copolymer was obtained. A mixture of cyclohexane and isopropanol 1 1 was added to the polymer solution with drawn from the bottom of the polymerization reactor to stop the polymerization reactor. Thereafter, an aqueous solution composed of 1 liter of water and 5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and the polymer solution were contacted at a ratio of 1 1 with strong stirring by a homomixer to transfer the catalyst residue to the aqueous layer. The mixture was left to stand, and the water layer was removed. The residue was washed twice with distilled water to purify and separate the polymer solution. The polymer solution was contacted with 3 times its amount of acetone with strong stirring, and the solid portion was collected by filtration and fully washed with acetone. Thereafter, the resulting solid portion was put into acetone in a concentration of 40 g liter, and reacted at 60 C for 2 hours. The solid portion was then collected by filtration, and dried in a stream of nitrogen at 130 C and 350 mmHg for 24 hours. By the above procedure, the ethylene DMON copolymer was obtained at a rate of 94 g hr. The copolymer had an ethylene content of 61.3 mole , an intrinsic viscosity of 0.85, an w n, determined by GPC, of 2.50, a crystallinity, determined by X ray diffractometry, of 0 , and a glass transition temperature Tg of 143 C. The copolymer contained 0.4 by weight of volatile comonents and 0.13 by weight of the unreacted monomers. Example 1 was repeated except that the copolymerization conditions indicated in Table 2 were used. The properties of the resulting copolymers are shown in Table 3. Using a 2 liter glass polymerization reactor equipped with agitating blades, ethylene and 2 methyl 1,4,5,8 dimethano 1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a octahydronaphtahlene to be abbreviated as M DMON d of Table 1 were copolymerized continuously. Specifically, the reactor was charged at its top with 0.9 liter hr of a toluene solution of M DMON so as to provide an M DMON concentration in the reactor of 60 g liter, 0.7 liter hr of a toluene solution of VO OC₂H₅ Cl₂ as a catalyst so as to provide a vanadium concentration in the reactor of 0.5 mmole liter, and 0.4 liter hr of a toluene solution of ethyl aluminum sesquichloride as a catalyst so as to provide an aluminum concentration in the reactor of 2 mmoles liter. In the meantime, the polymer solution was continuously withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor so that the amount of the polymer solution in the reactor was maintained always at 1 liter. Furthermore, 35 liters hr of ethylene and 80 liters hr of nitrogen were fed from the top of the reactor. The copolymerization reaction was carried out at 10 C by circulating a cooling medium through a jacket fitted to the outside of the reactor. As a result of performing the copolymerization under the aforesaid conditions, a polymerization reaction mixture containing an ethylene M DMON random copolymer was obtained. A small amount of methanol was added to the polymer solution withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor to stop the copolymerization reaction. The polymer solution was then put into a large amount of acetone methanol to precipitate the resulting copolymer. The copolymer was fully washed with acetone and dried under reduced pressure for one day at 80 C. By the above operation, the ethylen M DMON random copolymer was obtained at a rate of 60 g hour. The copolymer was found to have an ethylene content of 63 mole . The copolymer had an intrinsic viscosity, measured in decalin at 135 C, of 0.92, an iodine number of 1.0, a crystallinity, determined by X ray diffractometry, of 0 , and a transparency, determined by a haze meter on a 1 mm sheet sample in accordance with ASTM D 1003 52, of 3.1 . The glass transition temperature Tg of the copolymer, determined from the peak temperature of the loss modulus E which was measured at a temperature elevation rate of 5 C min. by a dynamic mechanizal analyzer was 127 C. Its melting point Tm was measured within a temperature range of 120 to 400 C by DSC Du Pont 990 type at a temperature elevation rate of 10 C min. . No melting curve peak was observed. Example 15 was repeated except that the copolymerization conditions shown in Tables 4 and 5 were used. The properties of the resulting copolymers are shown in Table 5. In Example 22, a 1 1 mixture of toluene and cyclohexane was used as the polymerization solvent. Using a 2 liter polymerization reactor equipped with agitating blades, ethylene and 6 ethylbicyclo 2.2.1 hept 2 ene f of Table 6 to be abbreviated as MBH were continuously copolymerized. Specifically, the reactor was continuously charged at its top with 0.9 liter hr of a toluene solution of MBH so as to provide an MBH concentration in the reactor of 60 g liter, 0.7 liter hr of a toluene solution of VO OC₂H₅ Cl₂ as a solution so as to provide a vanadium concentration in the reactor of 1 mmole liter at this time, the concentration of vanadium fed was 2.86 times its concentration in the reactor , and a cyclohexane solution of ethyl aluminum sesquichloride as a catalyst to provide an aluminum concentration in the reactor of 4 mmoles liter. In the meantime, the polymer solution was continuously withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor so that the amount of the polymer solution in the reactor was always maintained at 1 liter. Furthermore, from the top of the reactor, 40 liters hr of ethylene and 80 liters hr of nitrogen were fed. The copolymerization was carried out at 10 C by circulating a cooling medium through a jacket fitted to the outside of the reactor. As a result of performing the copolymerization reaction under the above conditions, a polymerization reaction mixture containing an ethylene MBH random copolymer was obtained. A small amount of methanol was added to the polymer solution withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor to stop the polymerization. The polymer solution was put into a large amount of acetone methanol to precipitate the resulting copolymer. The copolymer was fully washed with acetone, and dried under reduced pressure at 80 C for one day. By the above operation, the ethylene MBH random copolymer was obtained at a rate of 50 g hr. The copolymer had an ethylene content of 62 mole , an intrinsic viscosity, measured in decalin at 135 C, of 1.79, an iodine number of 0.9, a crystallinity, determined by X ray diffractometry, of 0 , a transparency, meaused as in Example 15, of 3.4 , and a glass transition temperature Tg of 100 C. The melting point Tm of the copolymer was measured as in Example 15, but no melting curve peak was observed. Example 25 was repeated except that the copolymerization conditions shown in Table 7 were used. The properties of the resulting copolymers are shown in Table 8. A fully agitated 500 ml separable flask was fitted with agitating vanes, a gas blowing tube, a thermometer and a dropping funnel, and fully purged with nitrogen. Toluene 250 ml dehydrated and dried by molecular sieves was put into the flask. Under a nitrogen stream, the flask was charged with 7.5 g of a cycloolefin f in Table 6 and 1 mmole of ethyl aluminum sesquichloride, and 0.25 millimole of VO OC₂H₅ Cl₂ was added to the dropping funnel. A gaseous mixture composed of 10 liters hr of ethylene and 40 liters hr of nitrogen was passed via the gas blowing tube through the flask kept at 10 C for 10 minutes. VO OC₂H₅ Cl₂ was added dropwise from the dropping funnel, and the copolymerization was started. While the gaseous mixture was passed, the copolymerization reaction was carried out batchwise at 10 C for 30 minutes. Methanol 5 ml was then added to the polymer solution to stop the copolymerization reaction. The polymer solution was then put into a large amount of methanol acetone to precipitate the copolymer. The copolymer was washed with acetone, and dried under reduced pressure at 80 C for one day. By the above operation, 5.4 g of copolymer was obtained. The properties of the copolymers were measured as in Example 25, and the results are shown in Table 9. Comparative Example 4 was repeated except that the copolymerization conditions shown in Table 9 were used. The properties of the resulting copolymers are shown in Table 9. Fifty grams of the ethylene DMON random copolymer A obtained in Example 1 was dissolved in 500 ml of xylene at 125 C in a nitrogen atmosphere in a galss reactor.Then, a xylenee soilution of maleic anhydride abbreviafted as MAH 12 g 30 ml and a xylene solution of dicumyl peroxide abbreviated as DCP 0.27 g 30 ml were fed gradually over a period of 4 hours from separate lines into the reactor. Since MAH had low solubility in xylene, it was dissolved by heating with an infrared lamp, and the heating was continued until its feeding was terminated. After the feeding, the reaction was continued for 2 hours, and after the reaction, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature. The reaction solution was put into a large amount of acetone to precipitate the polymer. The resulting grafted ethylene DMON copolymer was filtered, repeatedly washed with acetone, and dried under reduced pressure at 80 C for 1 day to give the desired MAH grafted ethylene DMON copolymer. The amount of MAH grafted, measured by oxygen analysis of the modified copolymer was 1.13 by weight. The modified copolymer had an intrinsic viscosity, measured in decalin at 135 C, of 0.86 dl g, a density, determined in accordance with ASTM D 1505, of 1.025 g cm³, a glass transition temperature Tg of 145 C. Example 33 was repeated except that 50 g of each of the cycloolefin random copolymers indicated in Table 10 was used instead of the ethylene DMON random copolymer, and the grafting conditions were changed as in Table 10. The results are shown in Table 11. Example 33 was repeated except that the random copolymer, grafting monomer and the radical initiator were changed as shown in Table 12. The results are shown in Table 13.
