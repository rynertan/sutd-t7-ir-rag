# Digital bidirectional transmission system with echo cancellation.

## Abstract
A system is provided which allows simultaneous inter change of digital information between exchange and sub scribers on a single transmission line. Data flows are transmitted by packets separated by short silence intervals within which clock signals are extracted and echo canceller adjusting is attained. Use of an adaptive equalizer and a single sampling operation per sampling pe riod are possible.
