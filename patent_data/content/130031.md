# METHOD OF MAKING CERAMIC SUBSTRATES

## Abstract
A method of producing ceramic items which does not necessitate the use of high vapor pressure organic solvents, aqueous solvents, binders or plasticizers. A monomer is used as a vehicle for deflocculation of the ceramic powder and, after forming, is polymerized to form a matrix which binds the ceramic particles together.
