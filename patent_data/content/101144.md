# STOP ACTION DIAPER STACKER

## Abstract
Conveyor chains, from which diaper carrying paddles extend, translate at constant velocity on a pivotable accumu lator frame. A cam turning at uniform angular velocity acts on a follower that pivots the frame cyclically between upper and lower limits. During one phase of cam rotation the frame and conveyor chains are caused to rise at a constant velocity which equals the downward translational velocity of the chains so the net velocity of the chain and paddles is substantially zero. During this stop action phase a power driven stripper bar pushes a stack of diapers from the paddles.
