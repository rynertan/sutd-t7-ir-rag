# CONTROL APPARATUS FOR A DAZZLE FREE REFFLECTION MIRROR OF A VEHICLE

## Abstract
A control apparatus for a dazzle free reflection mirror of a vehicle is disclosed. The control apparatus is provided with a rear light sensor and a circuit for driving the reflection mirror into a dazzle free operation in accordance with the intensity of the rear light detected by the rear light sensor when a light switch is turned on. The control apparatus is further provided with a mirror adjusting device for adjusting the reflection angle of the reflection mirror and a detecting circuit for detecting the adjusting operation of the mirror adjusting device. When the detecting circuit detects the adjusting operation, the dazzle free operation of the reflec tion mirror is disabled even if intensive light is incident to the reflection mirror from the rear of the vehicle.
