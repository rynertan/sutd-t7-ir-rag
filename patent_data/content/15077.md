# Self crosslinking aqueous emulsion coating compositions and method of producing them.

## Abstract
This invention relates to self cross linking aqueous emul sion coating compositions comprising an emulsion polymer emulsified in water, and methods for their production. The emulsion polymer comprises copolymerised monomers including at least about 3 percent by weight of a C₂ C₈ satu rated alcohol ether of a monoethylenically unsaturated N methylol functional monomer. The monomers making up the emulsion copolymer are emulsified during copolymerisa tion by a polycarboxylic acid emulsifying agent which is par tially neutralised with a volatile base to provide a pH of at least about 4.
