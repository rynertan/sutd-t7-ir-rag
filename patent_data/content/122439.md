# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ENHANCING THE FLUX RATE OF CROSS FLOW FILTRATION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A method of increasing the time averaged cross flow filt ration flux of a liquid through a porous filter medium over the period of a filtration run, comprising the steps of a flowing the liquid transversely through the filter medium by establish ing a pressure differential across the filter medium and b maintaining the filtration flux rate through the filter medium at a preselected substantially constant value during the entire filtration run by applying a variable throttling pressure on the filtrate side of the filter medium and reducing the throttling pressure during the run to control the instantaneous value of the pressure differential as required to maintain the pre selected flux rate, such flux rate being greater than the equilibrium flux rate. Also, a method of increasing the time averaged cross flow filtration flux of a liquid through a porous filter medium, typically filter tubes, over the period of a filtration run, com prising the steps of flowing the liquid transversely through the filter medium by establishing a pressure differential across the filter medium, and commencing the filtration run by gradually increasing the flow rate of the filtrate from essen tially zero to the desired operational flow rate over a suffi ciently extended period of time to substantially prevent the intrusion of the particles of material being filtered out of the liquid into the filter medium per se. Further, a method of increasing the time averaged cross flow filtration flux of a liquid through a porous filter medium over the period of a filtration run, comprising the steps of flowing the liquid transversely through the filter medium by establishing a pressure differential across the filter medium, and cleaning the surface of the filter medium prior to com mencement of the filtration run by flowing a cleaning solution laterally over the surface of the filter medium while simul taneously temporarily eliminating the pressure differential across the filter medium. Also disclosed are combinations of, and apparatus for practicing, the above methods.
