## Description
This invention relates to a structure of a color liquid crystal display panel. More particularly, it relates to a color liquid crystal display panel wherein a light polarizing plate in which a color filter is integrated is used as a substrate. Color liquid crystal display panels are widely used for color displays such as watches, electric calculators, televisions, measuring instruments, automotive instruments, etc. and furthermore, they may be used for optical applications such as graphic displays, optical shutters, etc. The conventional color liquid crystal display panels are such as those shown, for example, in the accompanying FIG. 4 Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 180525 84 , wherein polarizers 411 and 412, protective films 421 424 for the polarizers, glass substrates 431 and 432, a color filter 440, transparent electrodes transparent conductive coating 451 and 452, a sealing material 460 and a twisted nematic liquid crystal layer 470. However, these color liquid crystal display panels have the following problems Another color liquid crystal display panel is proposed as shown in the accompanying FIG. 5 Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 180525 84 in order to solve some of the above problems. In FIG. 5, there are indicated polarizers 511 and 512, protective films 521 524 for the polarizers, glass substrates 531 and 532, a color filter 540, transparent electrodes 551 552, a sealing material 560, a twisted nematic liquid crystal layer 570 and an intermediate thin glass substrate 580. That is, this display panel is featured in that the color filter is separated from the liquid crystal layer by providing the color filter on one side of the intermediate thin glass substrate opposite the liquid crystal layer and the transparent electrode on the same side as the liquid crystal layer. In this panel, the above stated problems 1 , 3 and 4 are improved to some extent, but no improvement is seen on problems 2 and 5 . There is a limit in thickness of the intermediate thin glass substrate 580 and there is also a limit in thickness of liquid crystal cell due to the presence of glass substrates 531 and 532. Furthermore, it requires later steps such as bonding to the glass substrate, etc. Another multi color light polarizing plate is proposed where a color filter is provided on a protective film for the light polarizing plate as shown in the accompanying FIG. 6 Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. 60106 82 . In FIG. 6, there are shown a polarizer 610, protective films 621 and 622 for the polarizer 610 and a color filter layer 640. When a liquid crystal cell is made by bonding this multi color light polarizing plate to a glass substrate, the color filter can be separated from the color liquid crystal layer. Although there are improvements similar to those obtained by said Japanese Unexamined Publication No. 180525 84, they are not satisfactory yet. Furthermore, viewing angle is smaller, since the transparent electrode and the color filter are faced through the glass substrate. On the other hand, when this light polarizing plate is used as a substrate of a color liquid crystal display cell, the thickness of the liquid crystal cell can be made smaller and hence improvements may be attained in making the display brighter, widening the viewing angle and increasing the workability. However, there are still the following problems. That is, the color filter layer and the transparent electrode must be formed in contact with each other, and ions, molecules, etc. in dyes migrate into the transparent electrode to cause deterioration of performance since a transparent conductive coating electrode is formed on the color filter layer by evaporation, a problem arises in adherence and yield is reduced. The inventors have made intensive researches to solve these problems and completed this invention. This invention provides an improved color liquid crystal display panel in which two light polarising plates defined below are provided, as panel substrates, on opposite sides of a liquid crystal layer. One of said light polarizing plates is made, in the following order, from the light polarizing layer, a color filter layer formed on the outside surface of a protective film layer, the protective film layer of non rotatory polarization polymer and a transparent conductive film layer formed on the inside surface of the protective film layer. The other light polarizing plate is made, in the following order, from the light polarizing layer and a transparent conductive film layer. The other light polarizing plate is preferably made in the following order, from the light polarizing layer, a protective film layer of non rotatory polarizing polymer and a transparent conductive film layer formed on the inside surface of the protective layer. The two transparent conductive film layers are brought into contact with the opposite sides of the liquid crystal layer. Protective films mentioned above may further be provided on the outer surfaces of the present color liquid crystal display. The above five problems encountered in the conventional display panels are all removed in the color liquid crystal display panel of this invention. Especially, the display becomes brighter, the viewing angle is widened and workability is improved by reduction of fabricating steps. One of preferred embodiments of this invention will be explained referring to the accompanying drawings. In FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, there are shown polarizers 11 and 12, protective films 21 24 of non rotatory polarization polymer film, a color filter layer 40 formed on said protective film, transparent electrodes 51 and 52, a sealing material 60 and a liquid crystal layer 70. The polarizers 11 and 12 are made of iodine or dichromic dye adsorbed with orientation to polyvinyl alcohol, derivatives thereof, polyenes produced by heating polyvinyl alcohol containing a catalyst for dehydration, etc. As the protective films 21 24, there have been used cellulosic polymer films such as cellulose triacetate in the conventional light polarizing plates. In this invention, besides said cellulosic polymer films, there may be used uniaxially stretched non rotatory polarization thermal resistant polymer films such as polyethersulfone, polysulfone, etc., fluorine films such as tetrafluroethylene hexafluoropropylene copolymer, etc., polyolefin films such as polypropylene, etc., polyamide films such as nylon 12, nylon 66, etc., polyester films such as polyethylene terephthalate, etc. The protective films 21 24 should be made of thermally and mechanically stronger polymer films, in order to form the color filter and the transparent conductive film or electrode thereon. Especially, polyethersulfones having the following structural formula are preferred, because the color filter layer and the transparent electrode layers can be easily formed thereon, birefringence at film formation is small and light transmission is good and furthermore, they have suitable thermal resistance and mechanical strength. The color filter layer 40 is of three primary colours and is usually formed on the protective film by printing or photolithography with pigments or dyes. The transparent electrodes 51 and 52 are made of a thin film of stannic oxide, indium oxide or an appropriate mixture thereof, metals such as gold, palladium, rhodium, etc. and is usually formed by sputtering, vacuum evaporation, etc. As sealing material 60, suitable organic or inorganic sealing materials are used and epoxide resins are ordinarily used as organic sealing materials. The liquid crystal 70 is, for example, a twist nematic one which is twist oriented by rubbing or oblique evaporation of SiO₂, etc. after the substrate and the transparent conductive film are treated with a suitable orientation agent. The liquid crystal may be a guest host one. The present color liquid crystal display panel illustrated in FIGS. 1 3 above may be modified below. One of modifications is that transmission type as shown in FIG. 1 is changed to reflection type by adhering a reflection film such as of aluminum on and under the protective film 24 with an adhesive agent. Another modification is that the protective film 24 and or 21 may be omitted. The other modification is that the protection film 23 may be omitted and is provided transparent electrode 52 directly on the surface of the light polarizer 12. The other modification is to put a glass plate on the surface of protective film 21 or 24. The color liquid crystal display panel according to this invention is able to use for color displays using liquid crystal such as watches, electric calculators, televisions, measuring instruments, automotive instruments, etc. and besides for optical applications such as graphic displays, optical shutters, etc. The color liquid crystal display panel of this invention is above to be thinner by 0.5 2.0 mm than the conventional color liquid crystal display panels as in FIGS. 4 and 5 and is considerably brighter in its display and besides is markedly improved in viewing angle. In addition, the subsequent step of bonding the panel to a glass plate with adhesives can be omitted, the fabricating steps can be reduced and thus workability is highly improved.
