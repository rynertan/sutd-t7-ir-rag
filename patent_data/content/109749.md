# Energy absorbing steering column.

## Abstract
An energy absorbing steering column 10 includes a collapsible steering shaft assembly 30 incorporating a slide 62 provided with deforming balls 70 that roll tracks 76 and 78 in telescopic shaft members 44 and 50 so that the shaft members are positively interconnected in a rotational sense and the balls can roll in their tracks to permit relative sliding of the shaft members on the application of a low axial load.
