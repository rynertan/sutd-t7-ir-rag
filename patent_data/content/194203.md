## Abstract
An automotive passenger vehicle, full face styled wheel construction having a sheet metal disc 14 with an outer peripheral portion 60 formed to provide an outboard tire bead retaining flange for said wheel. The rim 12 part of the wheel includes an inboard tire bead retaining flange, an in board tire bead seat portion, a drop center well portion 24 and an outboard bead seat portion 28 . The outboard edge of the rim has a radially in turned flange portion 30 extend ing circumferentially continuously around the rim edge adja cent the rim outboard bead seat. The rim flange has a radially extending abutment surface 36 at the outboard extremity thereof. The disc outboard flange 60 also has a radially extending rim mating surface 61 disposed in abutment with the rim edge abutment surface 36 . The rim edge flange has a radially inwardly sloping surface 34 extending between the rim outboard bead seat and rim edge abutment surface which defines with the disc outboard flange a trench 34 vs. 61 disposed radially inwardly of the rim outboard bead seat. The rim and disc parts are permanently joined by a circum ferentially continuous weld 16 formed in the trench.
