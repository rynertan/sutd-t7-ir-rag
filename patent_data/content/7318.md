# Constant velocity universal joint.

## Abstract
The rolling contact universal joint rotatably transmits power from one shaft to another without variations in velocity, at relatively large angles of deflection between input and output shafts. A cluster of gear segments capable of transmitting comparatively high torques over a wide range of speeds are interposed between interdigitated forks. The relative motions between the load carrying elements are rolling contacts between gear segments. The conical shape of cooperating gear surfaces affords opportunity for adjustments to eliminate backlash in the assembly or to take up wear.

## Description
Constant velocity universal jointIn wide use and possessing various designs in power transmission machinery is the universal joint sometimes termed knuckle joint which has been long existant in the art of machine building. In its earlierst and simplest forms such is familiarly known as theHooke s or Cardan type, consisting essentially of two forks connected through an intermediate block straddled by the forks and journalled thereto at right angles to each other. The Hooke s Cardan type of joint has the virtue of simplicity combined with capability of accommodating high torques at very large angles of deflection between input and output shafts.However, the dynamic performance is not ideal, since there is a variation between the angular motions of the connected shafts, which has unacceptably severe inertial load consequences at high speeds, large deflection angles, or with substantial masses connected by the cooperating shafts. Elementary analysis shows that the angular variation characteristic of the Hooke s or Cardan joint is described by the relationship tan tan 4 sec A where q and ss are the angles of rotation of the input and output shafts and LI is the deflection angle between the shafts. A typical value of the variation is seen at 2 360 which is at the upper limit reached in most high speed applications such as automatic front wheel drives, axles and transmission shafts.At this deflection the output shaft will alternately be angularly advanced or retarded, each twice per shaft revolution, to peak values of 60. The corresponding varifr tion in velocity is 24 referred to the input speed.It is clear that such variations relative position would be awkward in precision control applications where it is important to maintain accuracy of motion from one point in a machine drive to another point via a universal joint used to change shaft direction. The substantially large cyclical variations in velocity create intolerable vibrations and acceleration loads where massive loads are being driven.Despite the undesirable characteristic of non uniformity in the Hooke s or Cardan joint, its simplicity has led to extensive application where speeds and inertial loads are low and demands for precision of position are minimal. But increasing areas of application are developing where the consequences of motion irregularity are unacceptAble for reasons of noise, excessive vibration, imprecision of control, or consequent wear. Numerous examples can be cited such as the automotive front heel drives, helicopter rotor drives, marine inboardoutboard propellor shafts, hydraulic pump swash plate drives, etc.Beginning with the era of abruptly higher machine and trensportats speeds circa the end of World War I, intensive efforts were made to find substitutes for the Hocl.ses Cardan type of joint which would have uniform velocity performance.A small number of successful joints have been found, notably the Rzeppa and Weiss rolling ball joints, and a variety of sliding block types of which the Tracta appears to be the most frequently used. In addition a number of kinematic models have appeared which are theoretical laboratory solutions of the problem of providing constant velocity angular transmission. However, regarding the latter, their practical value is question able for reasons of complexity, non compactness, or low load carrying ability.A fairly frequent solution is the use of two llooke s Cardan joints in series, so phased that the irregular ties of one are cancelled out by oppositely directed variations of the other. This is less than ideal because of the added space required by the second joint, the irregular motion of the intermediate member between the two, inability in many applications to ensure that each joint operates at the same angle as the other as well as other obvious disadvantages such as cost, noise vibration and wear to mention a few.The rolling ball joints invented almost fifty years ago have enjoyed the greatest success and are used currently as first choice where high performance is required. However, they have limitations in respect to high manufacturing cost, limited durability, and are subject to derating at high speeds and large deflection angles. They are not susceptible of adjustment to take up wear and therefore cannot be assembled to a true zero backlash condition in view of manufacturing tolerances without preloading which detracts from load carrying ability and economy of production.It may therefore be fairly said that much room for improvement remains in the evolution of the universal joint regarding economy, simplicity, durability and other factors.An object of the present invention is to provide a universal joint which eliminates the aforementioned disadvantages and drawbacks of prior art joints and which is capable of being mass produced economically, employing reasonable manufacturing tolerances to achieve precise uniform velocity operation.Another object is to provide a constant velocity universal joint of the foregoing type which is not only simple but capable of being produced at relatively lo cost compared to existing constant velocity universal joints while being competitive with non uniform velocity joints of the Hooke s Cardan types in general use.Still another object is to provide a universal joint of the foregoing type which may be manufactured to existing standards of gear tooth or cam profiles and by the us of current gear or cam production tools in manufacturing practices.A further object is to provide a universal joint of the foregoing type which is capable of being designed to accept torque loadings equal to or exceeding existing constant velocity universal joints with equivalent size proportions and speed ratings equal to or exceeding existing types as well as a joint capable of ope rating at deflection angles equal to or greater than existing types.A still further object is to provide a constant velocity universal joint which is adjustable as to operating clearance for the accommodation of generous manufacturing tolerances to achieve minimum backlash in the original assembly and which is adjustable during the useful operating life to take up wear and thereby minimize backlash throughout the term of use, which feature is not available in existing types.

Where desired or necessary, the hubs and associated forks with segments may be integral with each other, that is to say they may be machined out of one solid blank and thereby eliminate the need for fasteners. In the drawings, these parts are shown as separate elements in the accompanying illustrations only to isolate their individual functions.The bevel gear segments 30a, 30b, 32a, 32b, 34a, 34b, 36a and 36b may be considered to be segments of a complete circular bevel gear so situated that the axis of rotation of the teeth of a given segment is a line through the center of the joint, but at 450 with the plane of the fork on which the segment is located. Each bevel gear segment may be regarded as a slice of its parent gear cut out on a plane at 450 to the gear axis. The origins of the bevel gear segments and their essential orientation are illustrated in Figures 13 to 16.Bevel split compound pinion segments 38a and 38b, 40a and 40b, 42a and 42b, and 44a and 44b are portions of standard involute bevel pinions as mating members with the bevel gear segments of a standard bevel reduction gear set which in the illustrated embodiment has a tooth ratio of 2 1. It should be understood that this invention comtemplates utilization of ratiosThe split pinion segments are as divided at the exact center of the parent pinion see Figure 15 and then the split surfaces are formed into the toothed contours 38a , 38b , 40a , 40b , 42a 42b , 44a and 44b , respectively.These contours are derived from a cylindrical spur pinion form or blank which is revised by a slight tooth modification accomplished by supplementary gear cutting of the spur gear tooth spaces to greater depth E and at slight angle ss to the spur gear blank axis, as a function of the angle taken around the pitch circle from the center element designated as 0 0. The extra depth cutting produces pitch contours which depart slightly from a circular form and may be described generically as paraboloid.The paraboloid pitch contours have magnitudes proportional in size to the distance from the joint center in the same way as the bevel pinion teeth are proportioned in size from the center. The extra depth E and angle p are as tabulated in the following table with reference to Figures 11 and 12, as modifications to a spur pinion blank which has a pitch diameter of .625 as large as the pitch diameter of the large end of the associated bevel pinion and the angle ss is taken inwardly in the same sense as the angle of the pitch cone of the bevel pinion teeth. Obviously, the described modifications leading to the spur gear configuration will be different for other than the tooth ratio of the illustrated embodiment. p .0005 .10 .0000 .00 inches degrees degrees 0.0028 12 0.301 0.0100 24 0.970 o.0i68 36 1.678 o.ot86 48 2.328 0.0133 60 2.953 Applicable directly to Cp or circular pitch bevel for bevel gear and pinion teeth. For larger values of C decrease E proportionately to the pitch C . P OL and ss are unchanged.Tension rods 46 and 48 have threaded ends and in association with screw studs 14 and nuts 50 serve to tie together pairs of pinion segments which are diametrically opposite and which have been found to describe theoretically identical motions in all aspects of the joint action . The two rods 46 and 48 are trimmed near the center of their length in such a way as to permit them to cross at about 300 in the common plane which contains their longitudinal axes. The trimming also provides for them to turn relative to each other about their axes so that the rocking motion of the compound pinion segments 38a 42b is unimpeded. The radial ly outward thrust forces which are an inevitable consequence of forces on the bevel pinion teeth, are balanced by the tension rods.The tension rods 46 and 48 are associated with only two pairs of the compound split bevel pinion segments 38b and 42b, and 38a and 42a, respectively. The other two bevel pinion pairs are accommodated by two rings 52 and 54, which fit together as shown in Figure 4 each having opposed radially extending threaded studs 52a and 52b and 54a and 54b and associated nuts 50. The tension between diametrically opposite bevel pinion segments is assumed in each ring through these screw studs and nuts. The relationships among the interlocking tension members is shown more comprehensively in Figure 5. The stabilizing links 56 serve to keep aligned those bevel pinion segments 40b and 44b attached to the somas ler tension ring 52. These two gear segments have no other inner abutment against inward displacement except the taper of the teeth. It has been found that in dynamic operation, tooth friction forces may cause pr gressive inward creeping to cause jamming in the absence of a positive stop against such a tendency. Obviously, other alternative means may be adopted for positioning the bevel pinion segments in fixed relationship with each other. Suitable key arrangements not shown may be employed and shims not shown may be deployed so that the bevel pinion segments may be exactly positioned inwardly for optimum gear operating clearance backlash to minimize tooth friction and permit adequate film thickness for lubricant. Such shims provide opportunity for initial fitting of the assembly in view of manufacturing tolerances. The shims also allow take up for wear in the course of extended operation to provide essentially ideal fitting and minimized backlash conditions throughout a long useful life.Thus, a combination cluster of gears transmit torque by means of tangential pressure contacts carried around as near as possible to the outer periphery of the cluster where the load carrying surfaces have the greatest mechanical advantage and to establish contours for the gear pitch surfaces which will provide for their intimate contact in all relative positions of the input and output members in rotation and deflection. The compound bevel split pinions 38a, 38b, 42a and 42b act as idlers between the bevel gear segments 30b, 36b, and 32b, 34b to transmit by pressure through them the torque forces from one fork to the other.The compound pinion segments 38a, 38b, 42a and 42b may rock on each other in such a way that the space between opposing forks is always exactly filled when said opposing forks assume a relative angular at titude to each other as opposed to a mutually parallel relationship . As will be appreciated, the necessary condition for constant velocity transmission is simply that the input and output shafts must not turn with respect to the axis of deflection and there for with each other as shafts are deflected from a straight line through the joint center.An examination of Figures 13 16 will serve to make clear that for the condition of shaft rotation where the shaft forks are each oriented at 450 to the axis of deflection in this case the axis about which the deflection takes place is the ry axis a total joint deflection angle of a as shown in Figure 14 causes the bevel gear segments to take an angular attitude to each other and forces the associated split pinion segments to rock, and roll down in the figure moving into that unique position where they just fill the space between the gear segments. The spur gear pitch surface is so shaped that regardless of the angle taken by the gear segments there is only one position that it can take, since any other position would not allow enough room.In other words, the associated split pinion segments roll into a hallow and stay there. It should be noted that the same behavior is exhibited by the matching split pinion segments diametrically opposite beneath the plane of the drawing . The corresponding behavior of those elements 900 removed are shown in Figure 13. Here the fork mounted bevel gear segments perform a pure rotation about the axis of deflection YY, in opposite directions to each other. The associated split pinion segments act in this mode as though it were solid or unsplit and simply rotates on its axis XX, through an angle equal to a 2 multiplied by the gear to pinion ratio which in this case is two ,It should be obvious that under the total deflection A the rotation of the split pinion segments as a unit no rocking necessary since the opposing gears are parallel the input and output shafts do not rotate about their own axes they simply swing aboutYY as a pivot .Therefore under the conditions described above for the relationships in Figure 13 and 14, the necessary condition for constant velocity is satisfied. It can be shown that any other position of the joint deflection about XX creates the same conditions as for that about YY creates a condition which is a vector combination of Figures 13 and 14.For example if the shafts are deflected by h about a new 45 axis WW, half way between X and Y, the same effect can be obtained by first deflecting .707 about Yet, then .707 A about XX. The resulting final position is the same and all the split pinion segments have performed two functions as shown individually inFigures 13 and 14 but superimposed upon each in combination. The action for the component of deflection about YY is identical to that of Fig 14 AA except to a lesser degree and the component of deflection about XX is .707 of that shown in Figure 13. This latter is pure rotation of the associated split pinion segments.This supplementary rotation of the pinion is not quite ideal since it has been rocked into a slightly noncircular form by the other component of the deflection. However, it has been found mathematically that in the case of 360 total deflection iX the worst consequence is the introduction of one thousandth of the joint s outside radius as looseness during the rotation. Such degree of looseness is negligible as a practical consideration in view of necessary operating clearances.One complete revolution of the universal joint 28 will now be described with reference to the drawings. Assuming a relative disposition of the drive shaft 24 and driven shaft 26 turned 450 from their respective disposition illustrated in Fig. 3, the pinion segments 38a and 38b will be engaged as shown in Fig. 14.Pinion segments 42a and 42b on the opposite side hidden will be rocked to the same degree but in the opposite direction. pinion segments 40a and 40b and 44a and 44b on the opposite side and hidden will be disposed as shown in Fig. 13. Turning the shafts 90 in a clockwise direction from Figs. 13 and 14 will reserve the disposition of pinion segments from that illustrated in Figs. 13 and 14. Towards this end, pinion segments 38a and 38b together with 42a and 42b will be disposed in the manner depicted by 40a, 40b and 44a and 44b in Fig. 13. Pinion segments 40a and 40b will then be disposed as are 38a and 38b shown in Fig. 14 with pinion segments 44a and 44b rocked in the same manner but in the opposite direction.Upon further rotation of the shafts through another 900 or 2250 from Fig, 3, pinion segments 42a and 42b will be disposed in the manner depicted by 38a and 38b inFig. 14 with pinion segments 38a and 38b then becoming hidden, rocked to the same degree but in the opposite direction. Pinion segments 40a and 40b and 44a and 44b will again be disposed substantially as they are shown in Fig, 13, but with their locations reversed. When the shafts are turned another 900 or 3150 from Fig. 3 pinion segments 44a and 44b will be disposed substantially as 38a and 38b are shown inFig, 14 with pinion segments 40a and 40b then hidden below rocked to the same extent but in the opposite direction, At 3150 from Fig. 3 pinion segments 38a and 38b and 42a and 42b will be disposed substantially as 40a and 40b are shown in Fig, 13. At 450 intervals from the positions shown in Fig.s 13 and 14 the pinion segments will assume positions that would be a combination of rocking and turning substantially as shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 8,In the preferred embodiment of the invention shorn in the drawings, the rolling contact surfaces are tooth ed. However, in a somewhat less preferred embodiment, the same result can be obtained by substituting curved cam contact surfaces which duplicate the pitch surface contours of the illustrated gears and pinions supplemented by crossed belt metal strips interposed between the contacting rolling surfaces and so fasten ed as to prevent slippage. Thus the several aforenoted objects and advantages are most effectively attained. Although several somewhat preferred embodiments have been disclosed and described in detail herein, it should be understood that this invention is in no sense limited thereby and its scope is to be determined by that of the appended claims.
