# Barge carrying vessel.

## Abstract
A semi submersible, barge carrying coaster 1 has a flat bottomed hull, a main deck accessible from the sides and, in one embodiment, from the stern, selectively variable water ballast means whereby the draught of the vessel may be varied to allow barges 2 to be floated on or floated off the deck, retractable extendible stanchions for retaining the barges laterally of the coaster and pressure means urged against the ends of the barges to restrain the barges longitudinally of the coaster.
