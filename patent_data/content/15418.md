# Process for the separation of the two optical isomers of 1 o methoxyphenoxy 3 isopropylamino propan 2 ol, optical isomers obtained thereby and pharmaceutical compositions of the levorotatory antipode thereof.

## Abstract
A process for the separation of moprolol having formula I into its two optical antipodes, by salifying racemic moprolol with L glutamic acid treating the thus obtained mixture of diastereoisomeric salts with a water alcohol mixture, in this way separating the L glutamate insoluble salt of moprol ol treating the resultant mother liquors which contain in solu tion the L glutamate sart of moprolol with a base so as to separate the levorotatory isomer of crystalline moprolol, which finally undergoes a purification. Also a pharmaceutical composition containing said levo rotatory isomer of
