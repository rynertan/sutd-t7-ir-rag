# Method for rapid detection of microorganisms in clinical samples.

## Abstract
A method for rapid detection of microorganisms in a body fluid sample is provided. The microorganisms are detected by fluorescence after treatment of the sample with a lysing agent to dissolve sample components and staining with a fluorescent dye. The lysing agent may be part of a composition which includes a culture medium thereby providing simultaneous lysis and growth before staining.
