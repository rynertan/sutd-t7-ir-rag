## Description
HERBICIDAL MIXTURES COMPRISING BENAZOLIN This invention relates to herbicidal comoositions and to a method of selectively controlling weeds in crops. Benazolin is the common name for a herbicide having the chemical name 4 chloro 2 oxobenzothiazolin 3 ylacetis acid. In this specification this name is used to mean benazolin as the free acid or one of its salt, e.g. potassium salt or ester e.g. ethyl ester derivatives, acceptable in herbicidal applications. It has now been found that unexexpected advantages may be obtained by using benazolin in conjunction with 2,4 diamino 5 methylthio 6 chloropyrimidine. Thus according to the invention there is provided a herbicidal composition comprising benazolin and 2,4 diamino 5 methylthio 6 chloropyrimidine. The invention also provides a method of controlling weeds which comprises applying to the weeds or their locus, benazolin and 2,4 diamino 5 methylthio 6chlorpyrimidine, either together or in sequence. The invention is generally applicable in controlling weeds in the presence of p growing crops such as cereals, e.g. wheat and barleY, maize, peanuts, sunflowers, sorghum, soybeans, rice and cotton. Examples of weeds that may be controlled include mayweeds such as Matricaria recutita, chickweed Stellaria media , knotgrass Polygonum aviculare , speedwells Veronica spp. , cleavers Galium aparine , pigweeds Amaranthus spp. , fat hen Chenopodium album , black nightshade Solanum nigrum , barnyard grass Echinochloa crus galli , meadow grass Poa spp. , millets Panicum spp. , cocklebur Xanthium spp. , dimsonweed Datura stramonium , morning glory Ipomoea spp. , sicklepod Cassia obtusifolia and prickly sida Sida spinosa . The weight ratio of benazolin to 2,4 diamino 5methylthio 6 chloropyrimidine in the mixture of the invention is preferably within the range of from 2 1 to 1 10, more preferably 1 1 to 1 5, e.g . 1 2 to 1 5. As examples of the quantities that are most suitable, the rate of application of benazolin can be from 25 to 500 e.g. 100 400 g ha. The rate of application of 2,4 diamino 5 methylthio 6 chloropyrimidine is preferably from 25Q 2000, e.g. 500 1500 hectare, The ratios and quantities of benazolin are based on the weight of the free acid. If desired the compositions may include other s uitable herbiefdes e.g. to broaden the spectrum. Examples of such compounds include br omoxynil, usually in the form of its octanoate ester, ioxynil, usually as its octanoate ester or potassium salt, triazines such as atrazine, terbutryne and trietazine and isoproturon. The mixture of active herbicides can be applied by, for example a spray treatment in any form known in the art for the formulation of herbicidal compounds and preferably as a dispersion or emulsion As a dispersion, the mixture comprises the active components dispersed in a liquid medium, preferably water. The primary composition for a dispersion can be provided in a number of forms. For example it can be a dispersible solution which comprises the active components dissolved in a water miscible solvent with the addition of a dispersing agent or it can be a dispersible powder comprising the active components in powder form mixed with a dispersing agent usually a surfactant and generally a powder diluent such as kaolin. An emulsion comprises the active components dissolved in a water immiscible solvent which is formed into an emulsion with water in the presence of an emulsifying agent. An emulsion of the desired concentration can be formed from a primary composition of the following types a concentrated stoc k emulsion comprising the active components in combination with an emulsifying agent, water and water immiscible solvent, or an emulsifiable concentrate comprising a solution of the active components in a water immiscible solvent containing an emulsifying agent. The above herbicidal formulations a re to be regarded as part of the invention. The total concentration of the active components in a composition for direct application to the crop by conventional ground methods is preferably within the range of 0.02 to 1 per cent by weight, of the composition, but more concentrated compositions containing, for example up to 20 percent may be desirable. In a primary composition the total amount of active compound can vary widely, for example, from 5 to 95 percent by weight. The invention is illustrated in the following ExampleExample A field of barley infested with various weeds was divided into replicate areas and sprayed at various application rates with aqueous dispersi√≥ns of benazolin ethyl ester and 2,4 diamino 5 methylthio 6 chloropyrimidine hereinafter referred to as DMC . Good control of the broad leaved weeds present was achieved using mixtures containing benazolin at a rate of 0.2 and 0.3 kg hectare and 2,4 diarnino 5 methylthio 6 chloropyrimidine at rates of 0.6 and 0.9 kg hectare. Synergism was exhibited in the following instances. Assessments were made 14 weeks after spraying. The weights of benazolin ester are bases on the weighto f the free acid.
