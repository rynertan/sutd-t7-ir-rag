# METHOD FOR MONITORING DRILLING MATERIALS FOR GAMMA RAY ACTIVITY

## Abstract
Well drilling materials such as muds and additives therefor are monitored for their gamma ray activity before use, and the effects of the activity, on well logging measure ments at depth in a well, are calculated. Thus, accurate correction of well logging measurements to take account of the background effect of the materials is achieved. A test cell for measuring the activity of the materials comprises a pan 10 with an upstanding central pipe 12 for receiving a scintillometer probe 11. Material to be tested 13 is placed in the pan.
