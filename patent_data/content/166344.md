# MEANS FOR ALLEVIATING EMITTER CONTACT STRESS IN BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS

## Abstract
An emitter contact structure is disclosed for alleviating forward bias beta degradation in a bipolar transistor. The structure comprises an emitter contact metallurgy stripe 3 which travels over a dielectric insulating layer 9 having an area of increased thickness 10 adjacent to a contact opening 11 between the metallurgy stripe 3 and the emitter 1 .
