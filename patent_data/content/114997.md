# Magnetic read head.

## Abstract
A read head is formed from a magneto resistive element 14 extending coplanar with a magnetically permeable yoke member 15 . The yoke member includes leg portions 16, 17, 18 forming pole faces. A first pole face extends adjacent to one edge of the element. A second pole face extends adjacent to the element. In operation the read head is located so that the element extends perpendicular to a surface 11 formed with flux transitions to be detected. The first pole face is located on the edge of the element remote from the surface. The second pole face extends over at least one flux transition 19 adjacent to a flux transition 21 beneath the element.
