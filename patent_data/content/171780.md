## Description
A device for positioning radiators, radiator valves and pipe connections in central heating systemsCentral heating system contractors follow a general practice of first hanging radiators on brackets sunk into or screwed to the wall, following which, the radiators themselves can be used as a guide for the positioning of pipes and relative fittings making up the heating system In order to prevent disappearance of the radiators from an unguarded site, and to avoid their causing obstructions during final plastering and decoration, the radiators are then removed until the moment when they can be installed permanently on completion of other workZ Thus, when hung initially, the radiator serves simply as a template for the correct location of fittings control and on off valves and of pipe connections this being the case, its purchase prior to the moment of being put into service represents an unwarranted outlay of capital, and reflects an additional item of labour expenditure in view of the need for subsequent removal and refitmentSIn another method of installation, a few radiator panels only are employed together with a makeshift support, such as a length of pipe inserted into the bosses for alignment purposes, and offered thus in rudimental fashion to the wall brackets, which will already be fittedWith such a method, gross defects in position are often encountered when hanging the radiators ultimately, and in order to make plumbing connections to the two valves which screw into the radiator, the need arises for bending pipes out of shape, thereby weakening the pipe material itself, compromising the end result in professional terms, and costing the installer time and effortThe device disclosed permits of installing a heating system without the need for using either radiators or radiator panels as templates for location of the fittings which connect with the water pipes of the heating circuit neither does such a device require auxiliary checking and measuring equipment, simulating the radiator as it does in every respect without involving the relative expense and the dead weight, whatever might be the size or type, or the material used In construction cast irony pressed steel or light alloy 1 The device is hung directly on the wall brackets as already located for ultimate installation of the radiators,An embodiment of the device will now be described by way of example with the aid of the accompanying sheet of drawings, in which fig 1 is the front elevation of a radiator, illustrating certain dimensions which must be respected fig 2 is the elevation of fig 1 viewed from the left showing the type of radiator, in this case a pressed steel design, provided with a transverse rail at the rear which is hung from a pair of wall brackets fig 3 is a front elevation of the device disclosed herein, showing dimensions which cover the different ranges of radiator size, and reference dimensions used for positioning purposes, including those for radiators of the type illustrated in fig 2 fig 4 is the elevation of fig 3 viewed from the left,With reference to the drawing, B denotes half the depth of the radiator C, the width of the single radiator panel nC, the width of a radiator having n panels H, the vertical distance between centres of top and bottom threaded bosses M, the external diameter of the threaded boss and A, the vertical distance between centres of the top threaded bosses and the axis of the transverse hanging rail of a radiator as in fig 2. The two outer ends of the device are provided with pairs of transversely disposed sleeves haing female threads a top pair 1, a first bottom pair 2 covering the shorter range of centre distances denoted H, and a second bottom pair 3 covering the longer range H , The two radiator valves are screwed into respective top and bottom sleeves, according to the positions selected for ultimate plumbing into the circuit 4 and 5 denote slots provided with reference marks, fitted to the upper section of a pair of vertical mouldings 6 which also have a reference mark and are slidable relative to a pair of respective graduated uprights 7 in order to permit vertical extension of the frame of the device, The slots 4 or 5 upper or lower accomodate a pair of sliding depth gauges 8, which are graduated and exhibit a right angle profile, and can be locked into position by relative clamps see fig, 4 such that the graduated arm may adapt to variations in dimension B occurring from radiator to radiator, particularly in the type hung by the method illustrated in fig1 2. It will be observed that, with the depth gauges 8 inserted in the lower pair of slots 5, one has correspondence with the centre distance A between the axis of the top bosses and the axis of the rail as in fig 2, whereas inserted in the upper pair of slots 4, the gauges lie at a distance A from the threaded bosses witch is shorter than A, The transverse arm of each gauge 8, provided at its innermost end with a notch at the bottom edge see fig 3 which locates on the wall brackets designed to accept radiators with a transverse support rail, serves to establish the E dimension, which is equivalent to C fig 1 in the case of radiators not having the support rail1 9 denotes the clamp securing each slidable moulding 6 to its relative upright 7, denotes a pair of depth stops which ensure that the bottom end of the device rests against the wall without swinging back and forth dimension D in fig 4 is thus equal to B half the depth of the radiator plus clearance between the wall and the rear surface of the radiator n 11 denotes a pair of bosses fig 3 by which to hang the device in the case of a traditional radiator as in fig 1, generally in cast iron,The bosses, fitted to the top pair of sleeves 1 and coaxial therewith, are interchangeable, and serve to hang the frame on the pair of wall brackets each boss adjusts through the angular and longitudinal directions in order to obtain the hanging reference point, and is locked in position thus, F denotes a preset distance, which is equivalent either to C or to a multiple of C, from the outer edge of the sleeve 1 to the groove of the reference boss in which the wall bracket locates, 12 denotes a set of articulated parallelograms consisting of criss crossed struts, The bottom ends of the two anchor struts are hinged to the bottom of the relative uprights 7, whereas the top ends of the two floating struts are integral with pads which slide internally of the uprights Embodied thus, the set of parallelograms permits of opening out the device to match the width of the radiatorMaximum dimensions envisaged for the device when fully extended, are 1200 mm vertical by 1600 mm horizontal1
