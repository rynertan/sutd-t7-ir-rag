## Description
MOTOR WITH SPLIT BACK MAGNET ARRAY This case relates to disc drive arrangements and head actuators therefor, and more particularly to improvements in associated actuator motor means.BACKGROUND, PROBLEMS The present invention concerns magnetic disc drive DD assemblies and particularly the structure of voice coil motors f√≤r DD actuators. Workers in the art of making and using magnetic disc drives for storage of digital data for computer and other applications are attuned to today s thrust to make these more cost effective. The present invention relates to improvements in the actuator mechanism and, more particularly, in the voice coil motor portion thereof in order to enhance actuator efficiency and access time. Context of Invention, Disc Drive, VC Motor, FIGS. 1 3 FIG. 1 shows a very schematic side view of a disc drive DD module of improved construction. Of particular interest here is the head disc assembly HDA shown in more detail in FIG. 2, with the dual actuators therefor being driven by an associated voice coil motor VCM as workers in the art will understand. Both the HDA and VCM are mounted as part of a deck plate assembly as schematically indicated. The deck plate assembly will be understood as comprising a deck plate mounting the dual voice coil motor VCM , the drive blower motor, the drive belt and its cover, and the HDA mounting hardware. This HDA is characterized by a dual actuator mechanism, including a pair of actuators each capable of covering one half of the HDA storage area and being adapted, as workers will understand, to position and move a set preferably 16 of read write transducers across prescribed respective disc surfaces. The dual actuator assembly comprises two carriages, each carrying four head arm assemblies. Each head arm assembly carries four read write heads. The carriage is fitted with a voice coil which moves in the magnetic air gap of the VCM. Note that, preferably, each actuator here carries 16 thin film heads, one for servo use and the other 15 for read write functions. The actuators are separately addressable and also include a portion of the HDA electronics. Preferably this is a Winchester type HDA consisting of nine 14 magnetic discs installed on a common horizontal spindle with two actuators. The spindle will be rotated in a known fashion e.g., at a nominal 3600 rpm, as controlled by a drive blower motor , allowing the heads to fly slightly above disc surfaces when the discs are rotating, and also.insuring that the HDA is free of contaminating particles. This drive blower motor mounted on the deck plate as indicated is an integral part of both the HDA and the air flowfiltration system. The HDA should be sealed and include a set of crash stop assemblies for each actuator. The VCM itself see FIG. 3 is according to my invention made up of a ductile iron housing 31 , an aluminum flux collector spacer 33 , a ductile iron flux collector 35 , two pole pieces 3 P and 3 p of 1018 rolled steel, a top and bottom magnet m l, m 4 , two side magnets m 2, m 3 , and two back magnets 3 M, 3 M , each bonded to a respective back plate 3 B, 3 B . The magnets are magnetized in a direction indicated in FIG. 3 to concentrate the flux in the flux collector 35 and drive it through the air gap via the pole pieces. The magnet area and thickness are designed to ensure that the pole pieces are saturated i.e., the average magnetic induction in the pole pieces is greater than 18,000 gauss . This ensures that there is little or no change in the flux density in the gap due to the demagnetizing effects of operating temperature variation and or high voice coil currents. The Problem, FIGS 3, 5 The arrangement in FIG. 3 represents an efficientVC motor for such uses, one exhibiting superior efficiency and power and decreased access time . Here, workers will be surprised to see that the back magnet and associated mounting plate has been split . The more conventional approach for such a ceramic magnet array would be to use a single back magnet on a single mounting plate. FIG. 5 will be recognized as a Demagnetization curve, plotting coercive force H vs. flux density B for standard conditions e.g., 200C, etc. for such a VCM with single back magnet curve DM, assume a Barium ferrite magnet , with a typical associated open circuit load line OL having a slope permeance of 0.31. Note one must magnetize outside the VCM assembly. The operating VCM load line LL intersects curve DM at a flux density value of A this may be conceptualized as the flux density available to a conventional VCM assembly with a one piece back magnet. e.g., assumeBarium ferrite or like ceramic magnet, such as 8 byColt Industries, or 8 B for higher remanance. The intersection of load line OL FIG. 5 with the demagnetization curve for such a magnet, shows that when the back magnet assembly is bolted to theVCM assembly there will be a loss in flux density. Workers will recognize that a VCM arrangement of magnets and flux carriers like that of FIG. 3 implies the use of ceramic magnets e.g., as opposed to using an ALNICO magnet, involving higher cost, unstable Co sources, etc. Thus, the invention will be limited to instances employing such ceramic magnets. Splitting the back magnet, as here taught, will be seen to increase flux density in FIG. 5, to value B, the intersection of bperating load line LL with modified demagnetization curve DM associated with split magnets . Proposed Solution FIG. 4 It occurred that one might derive some advantage by subdividing the conventional single back magnet for instance, by halving it along a cutting line C C, as is indicated for a single back magnet BM on a single back plate BP in FIG. 4. It was further theorized that one might separate these severed magnet sections and mount each on its own separate back plate. Thus evolved the split magnet arrangement of FIG. 3, as further discussed in EX. I below. Brief Description of the Drawings These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be appreciated by workers as they become better understood by reference to the following detailed description of the present preferred embodiments which should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference symbols denote like elements FIG. 1 is a very schematic side view of an exemplary disc drive arrangement of the type contemplated while FIG. 2 is an enlarged side view of an associated disc file with dual actuator mechanism FIG. 3 is an enlarged, exploded view of a contemplated voice coil motor assembly for such an actuator FIG 4 illustrates a single back magnet in plan view as proposed for halving while FIG. 6 shows two such halves mounted together in end view, as in FIG. 3 whereas FIGS. 7A, 7B similarly illustrate cutting a back magnet into thirds and FIG. 5 is an exemplary Demagnetization curve indicating representative effects of such halving . Description of the Preferred Embodiments General description, background FIGS. 5, 3, 6, and EX. I schematically illustrate an actuator motor constructed according to principles of this invention. This, and other related motor and actuator means discussed herein, will generally be understood as constructed and operating as presently known in the art, except where otherwise specified.And, except as otherwise specified, all materials, methods and devices and apparatus herein will be understood as implemented by known expedients according to present good practice. EX. I FIGS. 3, 5, 6 EX. I will be understood as following the above indicated concept of subdividing the conventional, single back magnet cf. FIG. 4 , resulting in a split magnet array as in FIGS. 3, 6. A preferred mode of splitting is indicated in FIG. 6 where each magnet half 3 M, 3 M is mounted on its own respective, back plate 3 B, 3 B . The back plates are then abutted and fastened to their housing bolted , leaving magnets typically in virtual abutment separated by an infinitesimal spacing sp e.g., a few mils or less, as manufacturing tolerance . Preferably, the back plates are abutted together in precise alignment e.g., as indicated at the dovetail join line in FIG. 6. Each magnet is conventionally bonded to its back plate e.g., with epoxy .The plates may comprise 10 10 steel or any conventional low reluctance material. The back magnets are identical and comprise a good ferro magnetic ceramic, such as Barium ferrite e.g., ,8 B by Colt Industries . This design is optimized for such ceramic magnets e.g., in respect of thermal stability, with good flux saturation maintained as described above . Results One is pleased and surprised to discover that this halving operation results in an improved load line as indicated in FIG. 5 at OL , with improved slope of 0.47. This results in a flux meter reading in the working gap of the VCM of the order of 3.1 x 105 Maxwell turns, where before only about 2.6 x 105 Maxwell turns would be typical i.e., before halving the back magnets . As workers will understand, this means more actuator power and higher efficiency for a given VCM current value thus improving access time a most important feature. Further Improvements As workers in the art will doubtless appreciate, one may further subdivide such back magnets e.g., into thirds, quarters, etc. to get a prescribed improvement in magnetic characteristic better open circuit load line , consistent with acceptable increase in fabrication time and expense and with some sacrifice in structural rigidity. Thus, for example, one may also subdivide the back magnet into thirds as indicated in FIGS. 7A, 7B Compare FIGS 3, 4 and 6 . Here, a representative ceramic back magnet will be understood as subdivided into three 3 identical portions mm l, mm 2, mm 3 , each bonded to a respective back plate cf. PP1, PP2, and PP3, respectively as before, with the plates joined to abut as before to present a composite back plate PP mounting the resultant thirds in virtual abutment as a composite tri partite magnet MM. Other such magnets are obviously apt for such subdivision with like results. Conclusion It will be understood that the preferred embodiments described herein are only exemplary, and that the invention is capable of many modifications and variations in construction, arrangement and use without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, the means and methods disclosed herein are also applicable to related VC motors for other disc drives and other actuator systems and the like. Also, the invention is applicable in cerain aspects for improving other related motors and or for providing positioning motive means as required for other forms of recording and or reproducing systems, such as those in which data is recorded and reproduced optically. The above examples of possible variations of the present invention are merely illustrative. Accordingly, the present invention is to be considered as including all possible modifications and variations coming within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
