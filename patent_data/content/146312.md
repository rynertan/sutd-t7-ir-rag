# Rotary optical transducer.

## Abstract
The optical transducer is connected to a rotary shaft 71 for detecting the angular position thereof and generates cor responding electrical signals. The transducer comprises a cas ing formed by two casing halves 11, 12 which can be as sembled together by means of latch elements 62, 63 . Mounted on a first casing half 11 are three phototransistors 31, 32 for detecting the light emitted by a diode 58 mounted on the other casing half 12 . A shutter disc 64 which is pro vided with radial openings is mounted rotatably within the cas ing on the shaft 71 which is supported by a self aligning bush 19 which is mounted on a casing half. A flexible printed circuit 38 is disposed within the first casing half, parallel to the shut ter disc and is in contact with the three phototransistors. The printed circuit has a projecting portion 43 which is bent over inside the casing so as to contact the diode 58 and a project ing portion 39 which extends out of the casing to be con nected to an external connector. In another embodiment the second casing half also has a self aligning bush for the shaft.
