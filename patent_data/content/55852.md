# Method and apparatus for controlling combustion of gasified fuel.

## Abstract
In combustion of gasified fuel by gasifying a low quality fuel and combusting the gasified fuel in a combustor, combustion of gasified fuel is controlled by sampling the gasified fuel at a constant flow rate at the upstream side of the combustor, combusting the sampled gasified fuel, detecting an overall energy level of sensible heat and heating value possessed per unit weight of the gasified fuel on the basis of the combustion temperature of the sampled gasified fuel, and controlling the flow rate of gasified fuel to be led to the combustor in accordance with a fluctuation in the detected overall energy level. Unstable combustion due to a fluctuation in the heating value of the gasified fuel and blow out due to deficiency of the heating value can be prevented.
