# A tracer control apparatus.

## Abstract
A tracer control system which performs tracer control based on a displacement signal from a tracer head TR tracing the surface of a model and is equipped with the function of freely setting the infeed of a cutter CT for machining a workpiece. The tracer control system is pro vided with a first drive system DV1, M1 for feeding the tracer head TR in the Z axis direction, a second drive system DV2, M2 for feeding the cutter head CTH in the Z axis direction, first and second position detectors P1, P2 for detecting the positions of the tracer head TR and the cutter head CTH in the Z axis direction, and a superimpos ing circuit SUP for superimposing on each other a position detection signal from the first position detector P1 and an infeed command signal for setting the infeed of the cutter head CTH . The cutter head CTH is led by the second drive system DV2, M2 in the Z axis direction so that the difference between the output signals from the superimpos ing circuit SUP and the second position detector P2 may be reduced to zero.
