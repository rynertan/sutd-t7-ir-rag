# Solar collection system.

## Abstract
A sun position sensor including a plurality of solar sensors 24 sensing solar energy 26 arriving in a respective azimuth and elevational direction, data encoding means for a series of respective solar azimuth and elevational positions, each position corresponding to a respective solar sensor and wherein said data encoding means are coupled to the solar sensors to derive a sensed solar position, a solar collector 36 effective for receiving solar energy in a discrete direc tion, drive means 30, 32 positioning the solar collector and providing position data corresponding to the position of the solar collector, and comparator means comparing the collec tor position and the solar position and providing a drive signal until the two positions are equal. A geodesic dome portion 20 includes several facets 1 9 each of which contains a respective plurality of solar sensors 24 to provide an electrical output signal respresenting the amount of solar incidence 26 on a respective sensor dome facet.
