# Machine tool with automatic tool change function.

## Abstract
In a machine tool with an automatic tool change function, a rotatable tool spindle carries a movable key engageable with either of a pair of key ways formed on a tool. A tool changing arm, serving as a tool support device, friction rotatably supports at least one tool for selectively inserting and removing the same into and from the tool spindle. When a tool change operation is to be performed, rotation of the spindle is changed into a predetermined speed permitting key engagement. A first confirming device is provided for confirming that the spindle is reached at a first predetermined position during rotation thereof. The tool change arm is operated to remove the tool from the spindle in response to the first confirming device. A second confirming device is provided for confirming that the spindle is reached at a second predetermined position during rotation thereof. Prior to insertion of the tool into the spindle, the movable key is withdrawn, and in response to the second confirming device the movable key is moved outwardly into engagement with predetermined one of the key ways.
