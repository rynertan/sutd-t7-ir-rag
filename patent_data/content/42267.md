# A dental apparatus having at least one drilling instrument and an associated operator unit.

## Abstract
In a dental apparatus having at least one drilling instru ment 1 energized and controlled by means of an operator unit 13 having a control member 14 which is movable out of a home position, automatical drying of a cavity produced by means of the drilling instrument 1 is caused by generating an air blow through an air blowing device 3 provided on the dril ling instrument 1 and being energized by the operating unit 13 through an air blow energizing device 20 at the return of the control member 14 to the home position after having been moved out of this position. The air blow may consist of two separate blows of different duration such as a short blow for blowing away droplets of water from a coolant sprayed dur ing use of the drilling instrument 1 followed by a blow of lon ger duration for effective drying the produced cavity.
