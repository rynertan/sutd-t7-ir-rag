## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to an electrolysis apparatus and, in particular, to an electrode and a diaphragm arrangement for the synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen gases from an aqueous bath. 2. Description of the Prior Art It is a problem in electrolysis technology to maintain a high production of hydrogen and oxygen gases from water cheaply and efficiently. A number of both unipolar and bipolar electrode arrangements have been developed and tested. Unipolar electrodes are used in Stuart cells and are basically covered by U.S. Patent No. 1,941,816. They are exemplified by those commercially available from the ElectrolyzerCorporation of Canada. However, they are flat plates limited to a single planar expansion in height and width, wire connections to a single side of the electrode, electrolytic concentrations of 25 to 38 potassium hydroxide KOH by weight, a pressurized system, high ohmic resistance, utilization of only distilled feed water, massive permanent structures, and coolant water circulating at about sixty gallons per hour per one hundred cubic feet of gas production. A relatively thick electrode corrugated on only one side is known from U.S. Patent Nos. 4,056,452 and 4,057,479. However, this electrode is bipolar, requires high voltages, and is limited to the use of distilled or chlorinated water. Its only perceived advantage is an attempted increase of electrode surface in contact with the water being processed. Otherwise, this type of electrode has the same disadvantages as the Stuart cell electrode. An electrode having transverse undulations on both its side surfaces iS known from French Patent No. 987,879. However, this electrode is also bipolar and requires high voltages.There is only a demonstration of enhancing the internal circulation of the electrolyte in the housing compartment. Further more, there is no discussion of any parallel wiring arrangement.Likewise, the electrode plates are separated from each other and are arranged point to point so that there is no possibility that the undulations of one electrode may intermesh and be evenly spaced from the undulations of an adjacent electrode. A plurality of separators having undulations on both sides and being evenly spaced from each other is known from U.S Patent No. 3,384,568. However, the electrodes are specifically disclosed as cord like and there is no suggestion that they may be made in the same manner as the separators. In fact, making the electrodes in such an undulated manner would be contrary to the entire thrust of the invention which is believed to reside in the cord like shape of the electrodes. A plurality of electrodes having undulations on both sides and being evenly spaced from each other is known from West GermanOffenlegungsschrift No. 29 06 821. However, the electrodes are bipolar and again there is no discussion of any parallel wiring arrangement. Furthermore, the undulations are wavy and not marked by sharp folds and edges. Additionally, the separators are arranged so that the undulations of the electrodes are prevented from intermeshing from each other. Therefore, it remains a problem to develop and commercially exploit an electrolysis apparatus which is capable of maintaining a high production of hydrogen and oxygen gases by decomposing water both cheaply and efficiently. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an electrolysis apparatus which is capable of maintaining a high production of hydrogen and oxygen gases by decomposing water both cheaply and efficiently. A primary object of the present invention is to eliminate the need for excessively heavy and oversized housings for electrolysis apparatus. It is another primary object of the present invention to eliminate the need for electrodes made of precious metals. It is a further object of the present invention tb eliminate the need for high voltage cables and heavy gauge wiring. Such cables and wiring are utilized in series arrangements of electrodes and usually produce large amounts of waste heat. It is also an object of the present invention to reduce the percentage concentration of electrolyte in the aqueous bath. Since electrolytes are usually heated and pressurized before being forced into prior art devices, the elimination of the need for such heating and pressurizing is a concomitant object of the invention. It is also an object of the invention to eliminate the need for accessories, such as circulatory equipment for the electrolytic solution, coolant pumps, and fans. Likewise, it is an object of the invention to eliminate the need for an initial purging of the electrolysis apparatus by an inert gas and the need for an ihitial filtering of feed water to the apparatus. These objects and other advantages accomplished by the present invention will become clear from the following description of the various emboaiments of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIN,ENTS As shown in FIGURE 1, an outer housing or compartment 1 is constructed of non corrosive, low electroconductive, highly insulative material, such as one quarter inch thick plexiglas.The housing 1 is small, lightweight, and easily portable by only one person. A bus bar 2 may be made of any electroconduc tlve material such as steel, iron, copper, or aluminum, but must not be attached to any other conductive material. It is preferred to mount the bus bar 2 on a nonconductive backing sheet 3, made out of plexiglas or porceleinized material, which is attached or otherwise forms a part of the outer housing 1. The function of the bus bar 2 is to receive d.c. current from a power source or supply 4. The power source 4 may be any F device capable of producing d.c. current, such as a battery charger, a standard auto battery, a photovoltaic cell which takes sunlight and converts it into d.c. current, or a d.c.transformer like those manufactured by the Hewlitt PackardCorporation. An amp meter 18 and a volt meter 19 may be a part of the power source 4Jas shown in FIGURE 1, or may be separated therefrom. Theoretically, water at 300C 860F disassociates into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas when about 1.23 volts is applied to it. However, the practical range at which disassociation occurs has been found to be 1.9 to 2.6 volts. The applied voltage preferred for the present invention is a constant 2.0 volts. The preferred amperage is about 4.0 amps so that the wattage being applied per electrical field by the power source 4 is approximately 8.0 watts. One electrical field, of course, constitutes a positive and a negative electrode for producing oxygen and hydrogen gas, respectively. In prior art devices, it is necessary to purge oxygen out of the entire system before beginning operation because hydrogen produced in an oxygan laden environment is extremely volatile in such high temperature operations. Such purging is usually accomplished with a relatively expensive inert gas, such as argon.In the present invention, no purging is required because the device operates at room temperature and there is not sufficient heat generated to create a volatile atmosphere. A positive cable 5 leads from the power source 4 and is attached to a positive side 6 of the bus bar 2. A negative cable 7 also leads from the power source 4 but is attached to a negative side 8 of the bus bar 2. The bus bar 2 distributes d.c. current to a number of wires 9 leading eventually to a plurality of unipolar electrodes 10 aligned in a parallel array inside the housing 1. This wiring arrangement differs from prior art devices which are usually wired in series and which require separate power sources for each electrode. This parallel arrangement of the present invention allows the power source 4 to supply about two volts each to an unlimited number of unipolar electrodes 10. When sea or chlorinated water instead of distilled water is being decomposed, there is no production of deadly chlorine gas because the voltage input is not high enough to disassociate the salt dissolved in the water into chlorine gas molecules. Also, because of this low voltage which is constantly supplied by the power source 4, it is necessary to utilize only thin gauge wire for wires 9. There is no need for the heavy gauge, high voltage, insulated wires used in prior art devices. Such thin gauge wires 9 may be THHN, i.e., 19 strand, 12 gauge copper wire, similar to that used for auto ignition wiring and for high fidelity stereo wiring. As best shown in FIGURE 2, wires 9 are attached to both ends of flat tabs 17 along edges of unipolar electrodes 10 by soldering, by alligator clips, by bolting, or by standard electronic connectors llN and llP. As shown in FIGURE 1, connectors llN join wires 9 leading from the negative side 8 of the bus bar 2 to the tabs 17 shown in phantom lines for negative electrode plates 10. Likewise, connectors llP join wires 9 leading from the positive side 6 of bus bar 2 to the tabs 17 for positive electrode plates 10. The connection of wires S to tabs 17 of any elec trode 10 is made outside of housing 1 in order to avoid the possibility of arcing and or shorting which may be caused by the corrosive build up of either electrolyte or aqueous impurities around the connectors llN and llP if such connectors llN and llP were maintained constantly in the aqueous bath. Furthermore, such outside connections facilitate the installation, maintenance, and replacement of wires 9 and connectors llN and llP. One reason for the attachment of wires 9 to both ends of each unipolar electrode 10 is that a more even distribution of current is permitted throughout each electrode 10. Another reason for such attachment of wires 9 to each electrode 10 is that monitoring of each electrode 10 is allowed by an ohmic multi tester 12, such as the type manufactured by Simpson Industries. This monitoring is done in order to detect any defect in a single electrode 10 while the entire pro duction unit is operating. The monitoring is accomplished by having the multi tester 12 measure the ohmic resistance of each electrode 10 in order to determine if current is indeed capable of passing therethrough. Thus, a defective electrode will be detected because it carries a reduced or zero electrical charge. Therefore, the defective electrode or any other electrical connection thereto may be removed. A greater degree of quality control will thus be maintained.The monitoring is done by disconnecting wires 9 from both ends of an individual electrode 10 at the bus bar 2 and contacting probes 26 with wires 9 in order to ascertain that the individual electrode 10 is, in fact, capable of carrying a full electrical charge. In prior art devices, wire connections are made at only one end of an electrode or to a longitudinally folded metal current distributor. Such an arrangement does not permit the detection and segregation of a single defective electrode. In such prior art devices, it is necessary to stop total production of hydrogen and oxygen gases in order to detect, locate, and service the one defective electrode. This inconvenience occurs because the monitoring device can be attached only to the power source supplying current to the complete system of electrodes arranged in series and, therefore, it can only determine if the entire system is operating at full capacity. The electrodes 10 are unipolar. This means that, as best seen in FIGURE 3, there are positive electrode plates 13 for receiving a direct positive electrical charge and there are negative electrode plates 14 for receiving a direct negative electrical charge. To the contrary, in prior art devices, electrodes in electrolysis apparatus are bipolar and have one face which acts as an anode surface and an opposite face which acts as a cathode surface when an electric current is passed therethrough. See McGraw Hill Dictionary of Scientific andTechnical Terms 180 2d ed. 1978 . Such bipolar electrodes require high voltages in order to distribute electrical current from one to the other end of the electrode so that hydrogen and oxygen gases will be produced at opposite faces of the same electrode. Each electrode 10 of the present invention may be made of relatively inexpensive stainless steel or another noncorrosive alloy containing nickel chromium NiCr , such as a tool wrapping sheet being .002 millimeters thick. For the production of only hydrogen and oxygen gases from ordinary tap water, this tool wrapping is a very suitable material. However, for the production of minerals from sea water, a stainless steel alloy of high electroconductivity would be more suitable. In the electrolysis apparatus utilized to carry out the present invention, the housing 1 contains a plurality of electrodes 10. As best seen again in FIGURE 3, there may be a plurality of housings 1 arranged adjacent to each other. Each housing 1 preferably carries a group of three electrode plates.However, a group of more than three, for example, fifteen, electrode plates may be carried in a single housing 1. Two positive electrode plates 13 produce oxygen gas on both sides while an intermediate negative electrode plate 14 produces hydrogen gas on both sides. Each electrode plate 13 and 14 is folded and edged in order to allow the gas bubbles formed at the sides of the plates 13 and 14 to flow freely in an upward direction through the electrolytic solution. As shown back in FIGURE 1, after the gas bubbles break through the surface of the electrolytic solution, they eventually escape through the discharge portals or gas outlets 15 and 16 which lead to oxygen and hydrogen gas collector consumers 28 and 29, respectively. The decomposed water is replaced by water in the electrolytic solution from a supply source 30 which may contain a regulator 31 for controlling the feed of electrolytic solution to the housing 1 through inlet 40. The folding and edging of each electrode plate 13 and 14 is preferred to be done on a standard metal crimping machine.Ideally, the folding and edging of the electrode plates 13 and 14 should be syruz,e.tXcal. Such symmetrical folding and edging of the electrode plates 13 and 14 allows a large gas production area to be compacted into a small volume of space. According to Gauss s law which is one of the fundamental equations of electromagnetic theory, an excess electrical charge, if placed on an insulated conductor such as an electrode, resides entirely on its outer surface and, in particular, tends to concentrate on points and along sharp edges. See Halliday and Resnick, Physics at 594 608 lust ed. 1965 . Electrical charges flow as current with less ohmic resistance at such points and along such edges. Therefore, more points on and edges along an electrode cause easier and thus higher production of gases at the electrode surface than at the surface of a flat, substantially planar electrode plate. The large surface area resulting from the folding and edging of the electrode plates 13 and 14 on both sides causes the oxygen and hydrogen molecules to disassociate more quickly from the aqueous bath and to be attracted to their respective positive and negative electrode plates 13 and 14. Because there is a great intensification of electrical charge along the edges, the release of the gas molecules from the electrode surfaces is of shorter duration then from flat or otherwise non edged prior art electrode surfaces. Such folding and edging on both sides of electrode plates 13 and 14 also eliminates the need for high concentrations of electrolyte because the negative oxygen ions and the positive hydrogen ions have to travel only a relatively short distance to the oppositely charged wall surfaces of their respective positive and negative electrode plates 13 and 14. A plurality of these electrode plates 13 and 14 folded and edged on both sides are arrayed in parallel rows and are held very close to each other by thin electrode holders 20 shown inFIGURES 2 and 3. As best seen in FIGURE 3, each electrode plate 13 and 14 would be positioned so that protruding edges of one wall on plate 13 would intermesh with recessed edges of an oppositely charged adjacent wall on plate 14. The distance between such intermeshed protruding and recessed edges could be as little as .5 millimeters which is approximately twice the diameter of an oxygen gas bubble. In prior art devices, such a short spacing between electrodes was not possible because the high voltages required therefor would result in arcing across, shortcircuiting, and welding together of the electrodes. For the present invention, the production of gases at the surfaces of the electrode plates 13 and 14 is substantially instantaneous because of the small spacing between the electrode plates 13 and 14. Upward flow of the gases to the surface of the electrolytic solution is facilitated by the intermeshed protruding and recessed edges of the electrode plates 13 and 14 which edges act as channels for funneling the gases upwardly.In all known prior art devices, a period of time for warm up and pressurization of the electrolyte is required before any gases are produced. Such period of time for some prior art devices is usually two or more hours. Also, in prior art devices, more electrolyte, e.g., 25 38 by weight in solution, is required to disassociate the ions from the water being decomposed and to cÅarry the ions to the walls of the electrodes. The need for this much electrolyte requires a great flow.of amperage which causes a large amount of waste heat to be produced. This heat has to be removed from the electrolysis apparatus. Such waste heat removal is usually carried out by heat exchangers, fans or coolant pumps. In the present invention, because low wattage ís utilized, the electrolysis operation is carried out at substantially room temperature. Thus, little waste heat is produced and there is no need for heat removal accessories, such as heat exchangers, fans, and coolant pumps. As best shown in FIGURE 2, a separator 21 is a microporous membrane made of polyvinyl chloride PVC . Preferably, the separator 21 is symmetrically folded and edged. However, as shown from its top in FIGURE 3, it may be planar. The membrane allows water to flow freely there through. Its main purpose is to keep the oxygen molecules from mixing with the hydrogen molecules after separation. A preferable material for the separator 21 is the Duramac diaphragm manufactured by W.R. GraceCo., Spartanburg, South Carolina. Other materials, such as asbestos or woven cloth, may also be suitable for use. The separator 21 is about .002 inches thick and is contained between two thin separator holders 22 shown in the exploded view of FIGURE 2 and in the top view of FIGURE 3. Each separator 21 and it two holders 22 are fitted between two oppositely charged unipolar electrode plates 13 and 14. As shown in FIGURES 1 and 2, the end electrode holder 20 has an upwardly sloping ramp 24 for directing the free flow of gas to its appropriate outlet. In FIGURE 1, ramp 24 is shown directing hydrogen gas to outlet 16. In the processing of sea or waste water for mineral extraction as seen in FIGURES 4 6, a diverter plate 23 is arranged next to the end electrode holder 20. In FIGURES 4 and 5, the diverter plate 23 has an upwardly sloping ramp 25 for directing the free flow of oxygen gas laterally to the top of a collection tank 27 to which the gas outlet 15 is connected. In FIGURE 6, the diverter plate 23 is shown in its inverted position so that the ramp 25 is sloped downwardly in order to direct the free flow of minerals precipitating out of thewater laterally to collection tank 27. Tests by independenf chemical analysts, unaware of the squrce of the minerals, have determined that the minerals precipitated out of the sea water contain high concentrations of oxides of iron, magnesium, and sodium. Small concentrations of oxides of calcium, potassium, manganese, barium, copper, and zinc have also been obtained. Minute quantities of gold, lead, silver, and tin oxides have also been noted. The collection tanks 27 are arranged at the side of the housing 1 in order to avoid build up of the minerals at the bottom of the electrode plates 13 and 14. Such build up would cause shorting and corroding of the electrode plates 13 and 14 if the minerals were allowed to accumulate at the bottom thereof. The minerals may be removed from the collection tanks 27 by lines 32, shown in FIGURE 4, through which the minerals are drawn by a vacuum pump not shown . No prior art device is known to the inventors for continuously producing hydrogen gas and oxygen gas while simultaneously precipitating out and extracting minerals from sea and waste water. In those embodiments of the present invention in which only distilled or ordinary tap water is being decomposed, an electrolyte is necessary to aid the electrolysis process.The preferred electrolyte is potassium hydroxide KOH . However, any conventional electrolyte, such as sodium hydroxide NaOH , may be used. KOH is used in concentrations of only about 2.2 or less by weight of the electrolytic solution. In unipolar prior art devices, 25 38 concentrations of the electrolyte by weight are needed. This is necessary to carry the current charge from the water being decomposed to the walls of the electrode plates because of the relatively large spacing between adjacent electrode plates. In bipolar prior art devices, concentrations of the electrolyte in the amount of 15 35 by weight are necessary. Because of such large spacing between adjacent electrode plates and also because the prior art devices require a high wattage to produce gases, production thereof can be achieved only by using such high concentrations of electrolyte. Another advantage of the present invention .is that the electrolyte is utilized at about room temperature. In all known prior art devices, the electrolyte is heated to various degrees above room temperature. Also, in some prior art devices, the heated electrolyte is injected under pressure.This injection under pressure causes the electrolyte to circulate around the electrode plates and to maintain uniformity of concentration. Such injection under pressure, forced circulation, and maintenance of concentration uniformity are not necessary for the electrolyte used in the present invention because of its low concentration. It follows that there is no need for any electrolyte in the present invention when sea or waste water is being decomposed because the salts therein are in a concentration sufficient to carry the ionic charge to the walls of the electrode plates. In the third embodiment shown in the exploded view ofFIGURE 7 and the top plan view of FIGURE 8, the oxygen gas flows through outlet 35 while hydrogen gas flows through outlet 36. These gas outlets 35 and 36 differ from the corresponding gas outlets 15 and 16 of the first embodiment shown in FIGURES 1 3 in that outlets 35 and 36 are holes aligned and drilled so as to carry a single pipe 38, shown in FIGURE 8A, passing through all plates which comprise the electrolysis apparatus. This single pipe 38 is less cumbersome than the multiplicity of pipe fittings shown in FIGURE 3 for the first embodiment. There is also less chance of gas leakage with pipe 38 than with the pipe fittings utilized for outlets 15 and 16 because there are less connections to be made for pipe 38.Pipe 38, as well as the fittings for outlets 15 and 16, may be made out of steelS brass, copper or any other suitable plumbing fixture material. After the gases are produced at the walls of the electrode plates 13 and 14, they rise through the water and break through the surface thereof. The gases contact the upwardly sloping ramps 24 of the electrode holders 20 and are directed to the exits 37 shown in FIGURE 8A. End plates 39 shown in FIGURE 7 prevent the escape of the gases from the housing 1 except through the outlets 35 and 36. The gases pass through openings drilled in the underside of pipe 38 shown in FIGURES 8 and 8A and eventually flow to the respective collector consumers 28 and 29 for oxygen and hydrogen. Above the positive electrode plates 13, the oxygen gas flows through the outlet 35 shown in FIGURES 7 and 8 at a ratio of 2 1 to the hydrogen gas which is simultaneously produced at the negative electrode plate 14 and which flows through outlet 36. The gases flow at only slightly above atmospheric pressure because they are pushed along only by the gases that are being produced therebehind and that are breaking through the surface of the solution below.Thus, there is no need for external pressurization, as required in known prior art devices, either by internal pressurization of the electrolyte or by external vacuumization of the gases being produced The fourth embodiment shown in FIGURES 9 and 10 is similar to the second embodiment shown in FIGURES 4 6 for the electrolyzing of sea or waste water to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases and to precipitate out minerals. However, the fourth embodiment has the same arrangement of gas outlets 35 and 36 as the third embodiment rather than the arrangement of gas outlets 5 and 16 utilized in the second embodiment.Another difference between the second and fourth embodiments is that the fourth embodiment, as shown in the exploded view ofFIGURE 10, utilizes a single positively charged rod 41P, instead of a plurality of male femdle connectors llP shown inFIGURE 1, for connecting the wires 9 outside the housing 1 to the tabs 17 of the positive electrode plates 13. Likewise, a single negatively charged connector rod 41N, instead of a plurality of male female connectors 11N, is used for connecting the wires 9 outside the housing 1 to the tabs 17 of the negative electrode plates 14. There is a pair of connector rods 41N and 41P which pass through the upper corners on each side of all plates comprising the production unit. However, in order to avoid electrical interference, they are offset from each other. Likewise, the tabs 17 for the positive and negative electrodes plates 13 and 14 must be offset from each other and lengthened or shortened appropriately to make contact with the corresponding connector rod 41P and 41N, respec timely Utilizing the first and second embodiments shown in FIGURES 1 6, the operation of the invention will be briefly described.Initially, water to be decomposed is supplied to the production housing 1 from a supply source 30 containing the XOH electrolyte through the regulator 31 which controls the feed of the solution through the plurality of inlets 40. Each inlet 40 feeds the solution to a group of three electrodes shown in FIGURE 3. Alternatively there may be a single inlet 40, as shown inFIGURE 4. In both arrangements, the regulator 31 meters the inflow of the electrolytic aqueous solution in correspondence to the outflow of gases so that the solution level in the housing 1 remains substantially the same. The direct current power source 4 is then turned on to supply electricity to the housing 1. Positive electrons flow through cable 5 tothepositive side 6 of bus bar 2 which distributes the electrical wattage through wires 9 and connectors 11P to tabs 17 of positive electrode plates 13. Likewise, negative electrons flow through cable 7 to the negative side 8 of bus bar 2 which also distributes the electrical wattage through wires 9 and connectors llN to tabs 17 of negative electrode plates 14. The electrical charge is intensified along the sharp points and edges of the symmetrically folded electrode plates 13 and 14 so much that the after H2O molecules in the electrolytic solution disassociate into positive hydrogen H and negative oxygen O ions. Because of the small spacing between the plates 13 and 14, the positive hydrogen ions are very quickly attracted to the negative electrode plates 14 while the negative oxygen ions are simultaneously attracted to the positive electrode plates 13. The ions flow upwardly along the walls of the plates 13 and 14 in the channels formed between the protruding and recessed edges of the adjacent plates 13 and 14.Before breaking through the surface of the electrolytic solution, the positive hydrogen ions join with other positive hydrogen ions to form hydrogen H2 molecules and gas bubbles. Likewise, the negative oxygen ions join with other negative oxygen ions to form oxygen 02 molecules and gas bubbles. These gas bubbles break the surface of the electrolytic solution and rise upwardly until they contact the sloping ramp 24 of the electrode holder 20 shown in FIGURE 1 or the sloping ramp 25 of the diverter plate 23 as shown in FIGURE 4.These ramps 24 and 25 direct the oxygen gas molecules to the outlets 15 and the hydrogen gas molecules to the outlets 16.The outlets 15 and 16 direct the gases to collector consumers 28 and 29 for oxygen and hydrogen, respectively, Simultaneously, minerals are precipitated out of any sea or waste water being processed and are directed by ramps 25 of diverter plates 23 to collection tanks 27 at both sides of housing 1. The minerals are then removed through lines 32 for further processing. In all four embodiments, after the gases flow through the outlets 15 and 16 or 35 and 36, they reach the collector consumers 28 and 29 which schematically represent storage containers and operating devices. For certain further operations, the gases may have any remaining water vapor removed therefrom by conventional drying techniques. Such operating devices may be gas heaters, transportation vehicles, welding equipment, coolers, stationary engines, batteries, or chemical processors. The gas heaters may be residential, commercial, industrial, or any other type of burner which could be used for cooking, baking, etc. The transportation vehicles could be private automobiles, commercial trucks, buses, marine vessels, or aircraft. The coolers could be air conditioners or refrigerators. The stationary engines could be generators or the like.The chemical processors could be those utilized for annealing metals, making fertilizers, producing methane gas, generating ammonia, manufacturing glass, and a myriad of other applications. The theoretical power required to produce hydrogen gas and oxygen gas from liquid water is 79 kilowatts per 1,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas. See Hydrogen , Van Nostrand s ScientificAmericana 1313 1979 . In the present invention, the actual power required to produce hydrogen gas and oxygen gas from liquid water is about 85 kilowatts per 1,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas. This figure compares favorably with other known prior art devices. or example, one such highly touted device is m.anu factured by Teledyne Energy Systems Inc., Timonium, Maryland, and has an actual power requirement of 155 kilowatts per 1,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas. The theoretical electrical efficiency of an electrolysis apparatus approaches a maximum of nearly 120 according to VanNostrand, supra. However, in practice, such devices have an overall efficiency of only about 30 when the losses associated with the electricity utilized in the production of the gases are considered. See Groundwork for a hydrogen fueled economy ,Business Week, September 4, 1978. The overall electrical efficiency of the present invention is over 90 . One of the main reasons for obtaining such a high efficiency is that there is no need for most auxiliary equipment generally required for the production of the gases by known prior art devices. The purity required for the hydrogen and oxygen gases varies with the use to which the gas is to be put. For example, commercially marketable hydrogen and oxygen bottled gases are usually at least 99.97 pure. Tests have shown the present invention to produce 99.0 to 99.5 pure oxygen and 99.93 99.99 pure hydrogen. The application of conventional drying techniques to the gases after production and before bottling should bring them up to the desired level of purity. These embodiments of the present invention are considered to be illuStrative Only since other modifications will be readily discerned bv those skilled in the pertinent technology.In any event, the scope of the invention is intended to be covered by both the letter and the spirit of the claims appended hereto.
