## Description
A pipe section for connecting to the ferule of a water closet.The present invention relates to a pipe section for providing a connection between the closet ferule of a water closet and a subs cintial1y horizontal conduit in communication with a vertical a toe pipe, said pipe section having a vertical symmetry plane, in which said pipe section forms a substantially 90 short bend.Various pipe sections are known which connect the ferule of a water closet with a conduit in communication with a waste pipe, said conduit often forming an acute angle to the waste pipe. In order to place a water closet where desired on an individual deck of a block of flats, the conduit leading to ,ilr waste pipe must extend horizontally in the deck and for this reason the connection between the ferule and such a horizontal conduit must comprise a 90 bend. For this purpose a pipe section has been used with a so called long bend, i.e.pipe sections .hot have a vertical symmetry plane, the inner nor io1 of the lend of aid pipe section having a radius of curvature in the symmetry plane of the same dimensions as the diameter of the pipe section itself. However, pipe sections with a shorter bend have also been used. R common problem with such pipe sections is, however, that the pipe section at the bend has a tendency to retard the flow of sewage with waste material, and consequently the waste material has a tendency to form a plug in the passage immediately beyond the bend, often filling up the entire cross section of the pipe. During its continued movement the plug may prevent air from passing and therefore has a tendency to draw all the water out of the water closet.This problem becomes especially great if the conduit leading to the waste pipe extends backward and away from the water closet, since the out flowing sewage has a strong turbulent flow, which after passing the drain of the water closet will have a relatively small total velocity component in the bend that is directed forward under the water closet. This sewage must be given a direction of movement directly counteracting the forward directed velocity component. For this reason certain authorities do not allow the horizontal conduit between the pipe section in question and the waste pipe to extend backward and away from the water closet, but only endorse conduits that extend forward within an angle of 750 from their respective sides of the vertical symmetry plane of the water closet.The pipe section according to the invention is characterized in that the pipe section wall forming the outer portion of the bend is shaped so that most of the sewage from the water closet is r eci in horizontal direction directly towards the aste pipe.By this means a flow of sewage is achieved which does not sim 1y follow a slight curve, thus reducing he velocity of ne flow, hut is thrown bock at the bend in horizontal direction and andis thereby given such a great hori zontal velocity component, that clogging is prevented, even ji the horizontal conduit extends backwazdand away from the water closet.Tt is. especially preferred according to the invention that the wall comprising the outer portion of the bend be made of parts of two or more cylindrical surfaces or cylinder like surfaces, whose generatrices extend perpendicular to the symmetry plane of the pipe section.Furthermore according to the invention the pipe section wall comprising the outer portion of the bend may be made of parts of two cylindrical surfaces, the first cylindrical surface treing located nearest the horizontal part of the pipe section and havina a centre of curvature which coincides approximately with the centre of curvature of the inner portion of the bend, and the radius of curvature of the second cylindrical surface being substantially larger, preferably about twice as large as the radius of curvature of the first cylindrical surface. By this means a simply constructed pipe section i achieved hich fonctions extremely effectively and which is relatively ensy to manufacture. Moreover, according to the invention the outer portion of the bend may comprise a curve of intersec ion with the vertical symmetry plane, so that both the transition between the horizontal part of the pipe section and the first cylindrical surface and the transition between the first and the second cylindrical surfaces are tangential, thus preventing cavities or recesses which may retard the flow of sewage.The invention may be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of a pipe section according to the invention, which is co extensive with the symmetry plane of the pipe section Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along the line I I inFig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic view of a pipe section according to the invention, mounted and in communication with the drainage system of a water closet in a deck.The pipe section shown in Fig. 1 has a vertical symmetry plane, in which said pipe section forms a substantially 900 bend, and comprises a straight psrt 1 adapted to be mounted in vertical position and a straight part 2 adapted to be mounted in horizontal position. The inner portion 2 of the bend has a short radius of curvature, making he bend relcive short s riLL be seen from Figs. 1 and 2, the outer portion or the hack of the bend is made of parts of cylindrical surfaces, whose generatrices extend perpendicular to the symmetry plane.In this way the outer portion 3 consists of a first cylindrical surface 4 with, c centre of curvature A, that coincides approximately with the centre of curvature of the inner portion 2, and a second cylindrical surface 5, whose radius of curvature is twice as large as the radius of curvature of the first cylindrical surface.A commonly used pipe section has a part 1 with a diameter of 110 mm adapted to be mounted in vertical position and a part 2 with a diameter of 90 mm adapted to be mounted in horizontal position. In such a pipe section the first cylindrical surface may have an angle oc of approximately 40 and a radius of 95 mm whereas the second cylindrical surface has a radius of curvature of 188.9 mm. The transition between the part adapted to be mounted in horizontal position and the first cylindrical surface as well as the transition between the first and second cylindrical surfaces are tangential, i.e. when mounted, the first cylindrical surface extends in the symmetry plane from a point located vertically below its centre of curvature and the centre of curvature of the second cylindrical surface in the symmetry plane is located on an extension of the radius of curvature of the first cylindrical surface, said radius being located adjacent the second cylindrical surface. The transition between the two straight parts of the pipe section is preferably made as smooth as possible, so that the cores used to manufacture the pipe section may be easily removed.In Fig. 2 the pipe section according to the invention is mounted in communication with the drainage system of a water closet 6, the part 1 of the pipe section that is adapted to be mounted in vertical position, i.e. the vertical part of the pipe section, being connected to the ferule of the water closet, whereas the part 2 of the pipe section that is adapted to be mounted in horizontal position, i.e. the horizontal part of the pipe section, is connected through a connecting sleeve with a horizontal conduit 9, which in a deck 10 in a block of flats leads to a vertical waste pipe 11 in the wall of the building. The invention has been described with reference to a special embodiment. Many changes may be made without deviating from the spirit and the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. For example, the outer portion 3 of the bend may be made of parts of one or more other surfaces of revolution with generatrices, which are either straight lines or curves with a radius of curvature that is substantially larger than the radius of the pipe, and which extend perpendicular to the symmetry plane. The outer portion may possibly consist of absolutely plane surfaces. The area of flow within the bend may not be substantially narrower ian the adJacent parts of the pipe section.
