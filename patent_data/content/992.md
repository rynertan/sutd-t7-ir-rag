# Heat transfer elements and method for the manufacture of such elements.

## Abstract
A heat transfer panels 1 comprises a wire mesh core 2 of high thermal conductivity metal, for example copper or nickel, and a closure layer of plastics material 3 , for example a urethane. The wire mesh 2 extends to or substantially to an outer surface of the panel to conduct heat from the outer surface.
