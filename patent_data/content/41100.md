# Improved acoustical tone generator and printing system using said generator.

## Abstract
In an impact typewriter printer using a daisy wheel type font 19 a stepper motor 23 for rotating said daisy wheel for character selection purposes and microprocessor 51,53, 55 facilities for controlling said stepper motor, means are pro vided for generating tones signalling the occurrence of pre determined events to be brought to the attention of the typist. For that purpose, the microprocessor facilities are used to detect and identify the occurring event and then generate a tone of a predetermined frequency by moving said stepper motor back and forth at given rates whereby the daisy wheel typefont is made to vibrate the surrounding air fluid and generate the acoustical tone.
