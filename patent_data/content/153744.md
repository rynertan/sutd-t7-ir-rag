# Process for producing permanent magnets.

## Abstract
A process for producing permanent magnet materials, which comprises the steps of forming an alloy powder having a mean particle size of 0.3 80 microns and composed of, in atomic percentage, 8 30 R provided that R is at least one of rare earth elements including Y , 2 28 B, and the balance being Fe and inevitable impurities, sintering the formed body at a temperature of 900 1200 C, subjecting the sintered body to a primary heat treatment at a temperature of 750 1000 C, then cooling the resultant body to a temperature of no higher than 680 C at a cooling rate of 3 2000 C min, and further subjecting the thus cooled body to a secondary heat treatment at a temperature of 480 700 C. 35 MGOe, 40 MGOe or higher energy product can be obtained with specific compositions.
