A liquid display gun is disclosed wherein a spray pattern control valve assembly 32 is located internally of the gun. The spray pattern control valve assembly includes a two position air flow valve 102 movable between a first position wherein low air flow is supplied through the valve to a second position wherein high air flow is provided through the valve. The valve assembly has two adjustable stops 151, 154 operable to fix the low air flow and the high air flow positions of the valve. Manual pressure on the end of the shank 106 of the valve, controls movement between the two positions.
