# Method of producing an improved poly amide imide resin.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved poly amide imide resin, a process for its preparation and its use as a tempera ture resistant resin. According to the present invention, there is provided an improved method of producing a poly amide imide resin comprising the steps of 1 reacting a phenanthrene with formaldehyde or a formaldehyde donor in the presence of an acid catalyst to give a phenanthreneformaldehyde reaction product having sub stantially only methylene bridges 2 removing from the reaction product unreacted phenanthrene 3 treating the reaction product with formaldehyde or a formaldehyde donor in the presence of an acid catalyst to give a high molecular weight product having substantially only methylene bridges 4 oxidising the high molecular weight product to break the 9, 10 bond in the phenanthrene moieties to produce a polycarboxylated reaction product 5 reacting the polycarboxylated reaction product with an aromatic diamine to produce a poly amide imide resin. The resin would find use as a lamp capping cement, as a high temperature insulator, in copper clad high temperature printed circuits, in electrical heater panels, in transformers and in glass or asbestos laminates for use as compressor blades.
