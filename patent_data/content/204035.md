# Catheter provided with an additional outer canalization.

## Abstract
A catheter 1 made of an elastomeric silicone material and the like incorporates in its end sector operatively housed in the orifice 12 of the human organ 7 , and in particular on its outer contact surface, a canalization 10 adapted to cause an additional flow of physiological liquid in general in course of expulsion, with guarantee of continuity even in case of a reduced delivery thereof, and, moreover, with a movement in a direction coaxial to the catheter 14a , and namely of its main inner drainage 14 , in order to permit the axial escape of eventual bacterial colonies 6 , as a consequence of said exter nal movement of the liquid, which movement still results in being originated and ensured by the simple difference of the inner pressure in said orifice 13 relative to that of the sur rounding outer ambient 14 .
