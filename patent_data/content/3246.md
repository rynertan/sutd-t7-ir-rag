# Polyamides and their use.

## Abstract
The invention relates to novel polyamides substantially based on polycarboxylic acids, in particular polymerized fatty acids, and polyalkylene polyamines in which the recurring alkylene groups are of different carbon chain lengths and two or more different alkylene imine groups occur. These polyamides show amine values from 5 600, acid values below 2 and viscosities of 0.05 25 Pa s and are useful as curing catalysts for epoxy resins.
