# A process for the incorporation of foreign DNA into the genome of dicotyledonous plants a process for the production of Agrobacterium tumefaciens bacteria.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the incorporation of foreign DNA into the genome of dicotyledonous plants by infecting the plants or incubating plant protoplasts with Agrobacterium tumefaciens bacteria, which contain one or more Ti tumour inducing plasmids, wherein as Ti plasmid a stable cointegrate plasmid composed of the plasmid R772 and the plasmid pTiB6 with foreign DNA incorporated in the T region of the Ti component of the cointegrate plasmid is applied as well as to a cointegrate plasmid pAL969 and cointegrate plasmids derived from the cointegrate plasmid by the incorporation of foreign DNA into the T region of the Ti component.
