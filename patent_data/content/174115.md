# Method and apparatus for safer remotely controlled firing of ignition elements.

## Abstract
Low level remotely generated control signals are ampli fied at a local ignition site using a local power source and the amplified control signals are used to charge a local energy storage device. Thereafter firing control signals e.g., control led duration suppressions of the remotely generated control signals are detected and used to control discharge of the thus stored energy through an electrical ignition device.
