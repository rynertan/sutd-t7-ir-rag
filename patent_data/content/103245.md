# Pattern matching apparatus.

## Abstract
The pattern matching apparatus, particularly for speech recognition, comprises first means for developing a first quantity d i, j , along time axes, representing the distance be tween feature vectors at each time point i, j of first and sec ond patterns, each expressed by a time sequence of feature vectors, second means for developing a second quantity g i, j , which is an integration quantity of the first quantity at the time point i, j , on the basis of at least the first quantity at time points including the time point described above and a second quantity previous to at a plurality of predetermined time points before the time point i, j , and third means for comparing the length I of the first pattern with the length J of the second pat tern and producing a signal designating a plurality of predeter mined time points in the second means in accordance with the result of comparison. This apparatus can prevent unnatural matching in carrying out dynamic programming matching be tween two patterns and can reduce recognition errors due to unnatural matching between different words in carrying out pattern matching in speech recognition. Furthermore, the apparatus is able to recognize the dif ference between similar consonant portions in carrying out pattern matching in speech recognition and can thus reduce recognition errors.
