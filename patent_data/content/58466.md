## Description
CYCLIC PERFLUOROALIPHATIC ACID ANHYDRIDES AND AMIDE DERIVATIVES THEREOF Technical Field This invention relates to cyclic fluorocarbon anhydrides, amide derivatives thereof, and a process for their synthesis. In another aspect, this invention relates to curable compositions containing cationically sensitive monomers, such as epoxides, and said cyclic fluorocarbon anhydrides or amide derivatives thereof. In yet another aspect, this invention relates to a process for curing cationically sensitive monomers, utilizing as catalyst said cyclic fluorocarbon anhydrides or amide derivatives thereof. Background Art Processes of polymerizing and curing cationically sensitive monomers such as cyclic ethers e.g., epoxides ,.vinyl ethers, and N vinyl compounds, in the presence of catalysts, specifically Lewis acids, such as boron trifluoride, aluminum chloride, and the like, are well known. However, many of these catalysts are highly corrosive to various substrates such as metals. Other known catalysts for the polymerization and curing of cationically sensitive monomers are undesirably toxic.Further, many of these catalysts rapidly catalyze the polymerization of the monomers with which they are admixed and cannot be used where a definite or prolonged shelf life and or pot life is desired or required. Though some of these prior art catalysts can be used in a latent form, e.g., BF3NH2C2H5, their latency is affected by moisture and prolonged latency is difficult to achieve in addition, when these latent catalysts are activated, this gives rise to the aforementioned objectionable corrosiveness. Also, many known catalysts are not effective for polymerization of a broad range of cationically sensitive monomers, e.g., for polymerization of both epoxides and cyclic siloxanes. Various linear perfluoroaliphaticsulfonic acid anhydrides of the formula RSO2 2O, where R is perfluoroalkyl, are described in U.S. Patent No. 2,732,398. U.K.Patent specification No. 1,120,304 discloses the use of the anhydride of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as a catalyst for use in the polymerization of various cationicallysensitive monomers. The utility of linear fluorocarbon sulfonic acid anhydrides e.g., those derived from monofunctional perfluoroaliphaticsulfonic acids as perfluoroaliphaticsulfonylation or acylation agents is also known. Use of the anhydride CF3SO2 2O as a trifluoromethanesulfonylation agent for formation of trifluoromethanesulfonamides by reaction with ammonia or amines is disciosed in Chemical Reviews, 77, 69 92 1977 .T. R. Forbus and J. C. Martin, J. Org. Chem., 44, 313 1979 have disclosed the preparation of the mixed anhydride, CF3SO2OC O CF3, and its use as a trifluoroacetylation reagent for aromatic compounds. In these reactions, however, the above linear anhydrides prbduce not only the desired trifluoromethanesulfonylation or acylation product but also produce an equivalent amount of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or salt thereof as byproduct. For example, the reaction of CF3SO2 2O with ammonia provides equal portions of trifluoromethanesulfonamide and the ammonium salt of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as a by product. Such by product is undesirable because of unfavorable economics in the preparation of the desired product. Cyclic fluorocarbon acid anhydrides are highly desirable compositions since, in contrast to the above linear anhydrides, reaction of cyclic anhydrides with reagents such as ammonia or amines can produce useful difunctional products by ring opening reactions without formation of the above described by products. Very few such cyclic anhydrides are known, however, because of many factors such as ring instability, or decomposition, e.g.,, decarboxylation, during the process of ring formation, or because of the inability of many difunctional acids to undergo ring closure by dehydration. Cyclic anhydrides such as perfluorosuccinic acid anhydride are well known and provide useful products by ring opening reactions such as reaction with ammonia to produce ammonium salts of the perfluorocarboxylic acids containing terminal carboxamide CONH2 functional groups.However, such cyclic anhydrides or their amide derivative s do not exhibit the catalytic properties of the cyclic anhydrides or amide derivatives of the invention described below. The use of ammonia or amine salts of monofunctional perfluoroaliphaticsulfonic acids as latent catalysts for the polymerization of cationically sensitive monomers is well known, see U.S. Patent No. 3,842,019 andR. R. Alm, Modern Paint and Coatings, October, 1980, pages 88 92. However, the salts described in these references do not include a second functional group in the molecule e.g., a sulfonamido or carboxamido group as found in the ammonium or organo ammonium salts of this invention. In U.K. Published Patent Application Nos.2,051,831 A and 2,053,902 A the formation of the cyclized productEMI3.1 is reported. This cyclized product is an ether sulfone, not a cyclic anhydride. Said U.K. Published PatentApplications also disclose fluorinated cation exchange membranes which are prepared from certain intermediates.The intermediates have the formula FSO2 CF2 nY where Y is COyl or CN y1 is a halogen, hydrogen, NH2 , OM M is hydrogen, a metal or ammonium group , or OR3 R3 is an alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an aryl and n is an integer of 2 to 4. Disclosure of Invention The present invention provides, in one aspect, cyclic. anhydrides of perfluoroacids, characterized in that said perfluoroacids are selected from omega sulfoperfluoroaliphaticcarboxylic acids and perfluoroaliphaticdisulfonic acids, and said cyclic anhydrides have the formula EMI4.1 wherein Rf is perfluoroalkylene having 2 to 5 backbone or catenary carbon atoms or perfluorocycloalkylene having 4 to 7, preferably 6, ring atoms, Rf optionally being substituted by one or more, e.g., one to three, straight, branched, or cyclic perfluoroalkyl groups of 1 to 12, and preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, with Rf having a total of up to 14 carbon atoms, and X is a carbonyl or sulfonyl radical. Preferably Rf has the formula fCF2tm where m is 2 to 4. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation by ring formation of said cyclic anhydrides comprising the steps of a mixing omega sulfoperfluoroaliphaticcarboxylic acid or perfluoroaliphaticdisulfonic acid precursor with excess phosphorus pentoxide, b heating the resulting mixture to dehydrate and cyclize said acid precursor under anhydrous conditions, and c recovering said cyclic anhydride under anhydrous conditions from the resulting reacted mixture. The invention further provides carboxamide and sulfonamide derivatives of said cyclic anhydrides, which carboxamides and sulfonamides are useful as latent catalysts for the polymerization of cationically sensitive monomers. Said carboxamides and sulfonamides are prepared by reacting one or more of said cyclic anhydrides with. one or more protonic nitrogenous base having a pkb of less than about 13.2.The preferred amide catalysts comprise carboxamides, sulfonamides, and mixtures thereof having the formulae EMI5.1 wherein Rf is as defined above each R1 and R2 is independently hydrogen, or a monovalent organic radical preferably alkyl, alkyloxy, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aryloxy, having 1 to 10 carbon atoms which can be the same as or different from any other R1 or R2, or each R1 and R2 bonded to the same N atom can combine with one another to form a cyclic structure containing the N atom, and R1 and R2 can contain from to about 20 carbon atoms, can be straight chain, branched or cyclic, can be saturated, unsaturated or aromatic, can contain skeletal or catenary hetero atoms, i.e., atoms other than carbon e.g., oxygen or sulfur , and can be unsubstituted or substituted with non interfering moieties, i.e., moieties which do not interfere with the functioning of said amides as latent acid catalysts.Compounds of formulae II and IV above are especially preferred. This invention also provides curable compositions comprising cationically sensitive monomers and a catalytically effective amount of said cyclic anhydrides or said carboxamide or sulfonamide derivatives thereof. This invention also provides a process for the polymerization of cationically sensitive monomers, comprising the steps of a mixing with said monomers a catalytically effective amount of said cyclic anhydride or said carboxamide or sulfonamide derivative thereof, thereby forming a mixture, and b allowing said mixture to polymerize, or heating said mixture to effect polymerization thereof. In addition, this invention provides perfluoroaliphaticdisulfonyl fluorides of the formula Rf S02F 2, wherein Rf is as defined above, which are intermediates useful for the formation of said cyclic anhydrides of perfluoroaliphaticdisulfonic acids. Detailed Description In the practice of the present invention, said cyclic anhydrides are preferably prepared by the dehydration and cyclization of the precursor perfluoroacid hydrate, caused by heating the precursor acid in the presence of an excess of a suitable dehydrating agent, e.g., phosphorus pentoxide, as shown below in Equation 1 wherein the precursor perfluoroacid hydrate is an omegasulfoperfluoroaliphaticcarboxylic acid, V, and the product,VI, is a compound of formula I wherein X is a carbonyl radical and Equation 2 wherein the precursor perfluoroacid hydrate is a perfluoroaliphaticdisulfonic acid, VII, and the product, VIII, is a compound of formula I wherein X is a sulfonyl radical .The dehydration and cyclization reaction is desirably carried out at a temperature sufficient to provide efficient and controllable reaction between the precursor acid and phosphorus pentoxide. For the reaction of Equation 1, such temperature is preferably about 1000C to 3000C and most preferably is about 1500C to 2500C. For the reaction of Equation 2, such temperature is preferably about 1000 to 1800C. EMI7.1 Equation 1EMI7.2 Equation 2The resulting cyclic anhydride product is volatile and can be collected by distillation. The cyclic anhydride is prepared and stored under anhydrous conditions. The amount of phosphorus pentoxide can vary depending on the amount of water of hydration present in the precursor perfluoroacid hydrate. Generally, a one mole excess of phosphorus pentoxide is used with anhydrous precursor perfluoroacid, but greater amounts such as up to a ten mole excess or more can be used with hydrates of the precursor perfluoroacid. An inert diluent such as sand, glass beads, or a high boiling fluorinated organic liquid is usually employed in the dehydration and cyclization reaction. The use of inert, fluorinated organic liquid diluent having a boiling point which is substantially higher e.g., 500C than the boiling point of the desired cyclic anhydride product is preferred since such a diluent facilitates intimate contact of the reactants, efficient stirring, and good heat transfer, thus aiding in the rapid completion of the dehydration and cyclization reaction. When fluorinated diluent is used, the volatile cyclic anhydride products can be isolated most conveniently on a small scale by purging the heated reaction flask with nitrogen gas and condensing the anhydride in a receiver cooled with Dry Ice to 780C.Alternatively, the reaction mixture can be subjected to distillation. The crude cyclic anhydride, obtained by any of the above procedures, can be additionally purified by redistillation, or can be used directly as an intermediate in the preparation of said carboxamide and sulfonamide derivatives. Said carboxamide and sulfonamide derivatives will sometimes be collectively referred to hereafter as amide derivatives . The cyclic anhydride should be stored in a sealed dry vessel to avoid hydrolysis through contact with water or water vapor until it is needed for use as a catalyst or for the preparation of amide derivatives. The presence of water or water vapor can cause the cyclic anhydride to hydrolyze and form the precursor linear perfluoroacid hydrate. The omega sulfoperfluoroaliphaticcarboxylic acid precursors Formula V, above for the preparation of cyclic anhydrides of Formula VI, above, can be obtained by means of a series of reactions, starting with the conversion of hydrocarbon sultones or hydrocarbon omega fluorosulfonylaliphaticacyl fluorides to the corresponding omega fluorosulfonylperfluoroaliphaticacyl fluorides, FSO2RfCOF, by electrochemical fluorination in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride in accordance with the procedure described in U.S. Patent No. 2,732,398. Alkaline hydrolysis of said omega fluorosulfonylperfluoroaliphaticacyl fluoride is usually performed using aqueous alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium or potassium hydroxide. A convenient method for preparation of the sodium salt involves the gradual addition of said omega fluorosulfonylperfluoroaliphaticacyl fluoride to a stirred aqueous alcoholic solution e.g., 80 to 85 by volume methanol at room temperature, followed by neutralization with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The resulting neutralized mixture is filtered to remove insoluble sodium fluoride and the filtrate evaporated yielding the salt, NaSO3RfCOONa, which is further dried by heating to 100 C. The recovered metal salt, M1SO3RfCOOM1 where M1 is, for example, Na or K , is dissolved in water, and the resulting solution is placed on a column of cationic ion exchange resin in the acid form e.g., AmberliteIR 120, commercially available from Rohm Haas, Inc. .The column is eluted with distilled or deionized water, and the eluate is concentrated under reduced pressure at about 500C to constant weight to yield the desired perfluoroacid hydrate precursor for the preparation of said cyclic anhydrides of Formula VI, above. The perfluoroaliphaticdisulfonic acid precursors Formula VII, above for the preparation of cyclicanhydrides of Formula VIII, above, can be obtained by means of a series of reactions, starting with the conversion of aliphaticdisulfonyl fluorides, Rh SO2F 2 where Rh is the hydrocarbon analog of said Rf radical to the corresponding perfluoroaliphaticdisulfonyl fluorides, Rf SO2F 2, by electrochemical fluorination in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride in accordance with the procedure described in U.S. PatentNo. 2,732,398. Alkaline hydrolysis of said perfluoroaliphaticdisulfonyl fluoride is performed by gradual addition thereof to a stirred solution of aqueous metal base such as carbonate or hydroxide of a metal such as sodium or potassium.Stirring is continued until completion of the reaction, followed by collection of the resulting solid salt product, rinsing of the salt with a small amount of cold water, and drying. The recovered product, Rf SO3M2 2 where M2 is for example, Na or K , is dissolved in water, and the resulting solution is placed on a column of cationic ion exchange resin in the acid form e.g., Amberlite IR 120 . The column is eluted with distilled or deionized water, and the eluate is concentrated under reduced pressure at about 500C to constant weight to yield the desired acid hydrate precursor for the prepara tion of said cyclic anhydrides of Formula VIII, above. Representative cyclic omega sulfoperfluoroaliphaticcarboxylic acid anhydrides of this invention include the following compounds EMI10.1 m 2, 3, or 4EMI10.2 Representative cyclic perfluoroaliphaticdisulfonic acid anhydrides of this invention include the following compounds EMI10.3 p 2, 3, 4 and 5EMI10.4 EMI11.1 The amide derivatives of the cyclic anhydrides of the invention are obtained by reaction of the cyclic anhydride with a stoichiometric or excess amount of protonic nitrogenous base having a pkb less than about 13.2, such as ammonia, hydrazines, and organic amines containing at least one reactive hydrogen atom attached to nitrogen. The term hydrazine as used herein broadly includes hydrazine and hydrazine derivatives in which one or more hydrogen atoms bonded to nitrogen is replaced withR1 or R2 organic groups.Preferred nitrogenous bases have the formula HNR1R2, where R1 and R2 are as defined above.The cyclic anhydrides of this invention are reactive even with weakly basic amines such as diphenylamine which has a pkb of 13.12 . The reaction of the cyclic anhydride with the protonic nitrogenous base is carried out at a temperature which provides efficient and controlled reaction between the cyclic anhydride and nitrogenous base. Such temperature is generally about 300 to 1500C, depending on the reactivity of the nitrogenous base. The reaction usually occurs readily at room temperature, with cooling sometimes being desirable to control the exotherm. The reactants can be combined in any order but a preferred method of conducting the amide formation reaction is by the slow addition of ammonia or amine to a stirred, cold e.g., 0 to 10 C solution of the cyclic anhydride in an anhydrous inert solvent such as methylene chloride. Other suitable inert solvents include diethyl ether, isopropyl ether and acetonitrile.The amide derivative is a salt in the form of an oil, grease, or solid. The oily or greasy salts are purified by decanting or evaporation of solvent.The solid salts can be isolated by filtration and purified by crystallization from an appropriate solvent or solvent mixture. Preferred amide derivatives are obtained by the reaction of the cyclic anhydride with ammonia or a primary or secondary organic amine. When the cyclic anhydride is derived from omega sulfoperfluoroaliphaticcarboxylic acid, two products are formed. The major amide derivative formed is represented by Formula II above and can be referred to as the carboxamidoperfluoroal iphaticsulfonate. The minor amide derivative formed is represented by Formula III above and can be referred to as the sulfonamidoperfluoroaliphaticcarboxylate. Generally only small amounts of said sulfonamidoperfluoroaliphaticcarboxyate are obtained.However, when the protonic nitrogenous base used in the preparation of amide derivatives is ammonia, then a 1 1 mixture of compounds of Formulas II and III above is generally obtained. When the cyclic anhydride is derived from perfluoroaliphaticdisulfonic acid, a single sulfonamide derivative is formed. This sulfonamide derivative is represented by Formula IV above and can be referred to as the sulfonamidoperfluoroaliphaticsulfonate.

R1 and R2 together with N can be, for example, N piperidyl or N pyrrol idyl. Representative organic amines having a pkb of about 13.2 or less and the formula HNR1R2 are described in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics , 47th Edition, D 85 1966 1967 .

Such amines can contain substituent groups which are essentially non reactive or less reactive than the amino group of the organic amine, including halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, nitrile, carboxy and carboalkoxy. Other protonic nitrogenous bases containing more than one basic NH or NH2 group can afford amide derivatives of this invention which are useful as catalysts. Such derivatives are generally more complex than the products represented by Formulae II, III, and IV, and can be oligomers or polymers. Such nitrogenous bases include hydrazine, sym dimethylhydrazine, methylhydrazine, methylhydrazinecarboxylate, guanidine, aminoguanidine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, hexamethylenediamine, piperazine, polyethyleneimine, and the like.

Said amide derivatives of the cyclic anhydrides of this invention are latent catalysts, particularly with respect to epoxides. The term latent catalyst as used herein means a catalyst which does not exhibit or manifest any substantial curing or catalytic effect on monomer admixed therewith during normal storage or handling of such mixtures until the mixture is subjected to heat for the purpose of activation, though some small or otherwise tolerable or insignificant curing of the monomer may take place before activation, as evidenced by a slight increase in viscosity. Similarly, a composition which has latency or is characterized as being latently curable is one which during the period prior to being heated to effect cure, exhibits little if any gelling, polymerization, etc., though some small or otherwise tolerable or insignificant curing may take place during such period. The monomers that can be cured or polymerized with the compounds of this invention, using the latter in a catalytically effective amount, are those known to undergo cationic polymerization and include 1,2 , 1,3 , and 1,4 cyclic ethers also designated as 1,2 , 1,3 , and 1,4 epoxides , vinyl ethers, N vinyl compounds, ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbons, cyclic formals, and cyclic organosiloxanes. An extensive list of cationically polymerizable monomers which can be used in this invention is given in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,347,676 and 3,842,019. The cyclic ethers which can be polymerized in accordance with this invention include those described in Ring Opening Polymerizations, Vol. 2, by Frisch andReegan, Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1969 . Suitable 1,2 cyclic ethers are the monomeric and polymeric types of epoxides.They can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, or heterocyclic and will typically have an epoxy equivalency of from 1 to 6, preferably 1 to 3. Particularly useful are the aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and glycidyl ether type 1,2epoxides such as propylene oxide, epichlorohydrin, styrene oxide, vinylcyclohexene oxide, vinylcyclohexene dioxide, glycidol, butadiene oxide, glycidyl methacrylate, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, 3,4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3,4 epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate, 3,4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexylmethyl 3, 4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexanecarboxylate, bis 3,4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexylmethyl adipate, dipentene oxide, epoxidized polybutadiene, 1,4 butanediol diglycidyl ether, polyglycidyl ether of phenolformaldehyde resole or novolak resin, resorcinol diglycidyl ether, and epoxy silicones, e.g., dimethylsiloxanes having cycloaliphatic epoxide or glycidyl ether groups. A wide variety of commercial epoxy resins is available and listed in Handbook of Epoxy Resins by Lee and Neville, McGraw HillBook Company, New York 1967 and in Epoxy ResinTechnology by P.F. Bruins, John Wiley Sons, New York 1968 . Representative of the 1,3 and 1,4 cyclic ethers which can be polymerized in accordance with this invention are oxetane, 3,3 bis chloromethyl oxetane, and tetrahydrofuran. Another useful class of cationically sensitive monomers which can be polymerized in accordance with this invention is represented by the general formulaCH2 C Y XR , where X is O or NR where R is hydrogen or lower alkyl , R is hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbylcarbonyl, halohydrocarbyl, or hydroxyhydrocarbyl when X is oxygen, or R is hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbylcarbonyl, or hydrocarbylsulfonyl when X is nitrogen, and Y is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, or other hydrocarbyl, or R as hydrocarbylcarbonyl and R can be connected to form a 5 or 6 membered cyclic structure containing nitrogen as a hetero ring atom. The term hydrocarbyl is used herein in its usual sense to mean alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, alkaryl, arylalkyl, and the like. In general, monomers of this type contain a vinyl group and are typified by vinyl alkyl ethers, such as vinyl methyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl n butyl ether, vinyl 2 chloroethyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether, vinyl phenyl ether and vinyl 2 ethylhexyl ether, vinyl ethers of substituted aliphatic alcohols such as divinyl ether of butanediol, hydroxybutyl vinyl ether, and N vinyl compounds such as N vinyl N methyl octanesulfonamide andN vinylpyrrolidone. A description of vinyl monomers and their use in preparing polymers is set forth in Vinyl andRelated Polymers, by Schildknecht, published by JohnWiley Sons, Inc., New York 1952 . Other cationically sensitive monomers which can be polymerized in this invention include ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbons such as isobutylene, 1,3 buta diene, isoprene, styrene, and divinylbenzene, especially the vinyl benzenes, cyclic formals such as trioxane, 1,3 dioxolane, 2 vinyl 1,3 dioxolane and methyl l,3 dioxolane, and cyclic siloxanes which can contain various groups attached to the silicon atom such as a hydrocarbon radical alkyl, aryl, alkaryl , an alkenyl hydrocarbon radical vinyl, allyl or acryloyloxyalkyl , a halogenated hydrocarbon radical, a carboxy containing hydrocarbon radical or ester group, a cyanohydrocarbon radical, hydrogen, halogen or a hydroxy group.Representative cyclic siloxanes are hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, phenylheptamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, vinylheptamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, methacryloyloxymethylheptamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, bromomethylheptamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, 3 chloropropylheptamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, l,2,3 tris 3,3,3 trifluoro propyl 1,2,3 trimethylcyclotrisiloxane, acetoxymethylheptamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, cyanomethylheptamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, 1,2,3 trihydro ,1,2,3 trimethylcyclo trisiloxane, and chloroheptamethylcyclotetrasiloxane.Other known cyclic siloxanes are listed in Chemistry andTechnology of Silicones by Walter Noll, Academic Press,New York 1968 , Tables 41, 44 and 45. The cyclic siloxanes can also be polymerized in the presence of relatively low molecular weight linear siloxanes such as hexamethyldisiloxane, chloropentamethyldisiloxane and octamethyltrisiloxane which serve to terminate the growing chain and provide stable fluids or fluids having reactive end groups. There is a host of commercially available cationically sensitive monomers which can be used in this invention. In particular, cyclic ethers which are readily available include propylene oxide, oxetane, epichlorohydrin, tetrahydrofuran, styrene oxide, vinylcyclohexene oxide, glycidol, glycidyl methacrylate, octylene oxide, phenyl glycidyl ether, 1,2 butane oxide, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A e.g., Epon 828 and DER 331 , vinylcyclohexene dioxide e.g., ERL 4206 , 3, 4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3, 4 epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate e.g., ERL 4221 , 3,4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexylmethyl3,4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexanecarboxylate e.g., ERL 4201 , bis 3,4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexylmethyl adipate e.g., ERL 4289 , aliphatic epoxy modified with polypropylene glycol e.g., ERL 4050 and ERL 4052 , dipentene dioxide e.g., ERL 4269 , epoxidized polybutadiene e.g., Oxiron 2001 , silicone epoxy e.g., Syl Kem 90 , 1,4 butanediol diglycidyl ether e.g., Araldite RD 2 , polyglycidyl ether of phenolformaldehyde novolak e.g., DEN 431, Epi Rez 521 and DEN 438 , resorcinol diglycidyl ether e.g., Kopoxite , polyglycol diepoxide e.g., DER 736 , polyacrylate epoxide e.g., Epocryl U 14 , urethane modified epoxide e.g., QX3599 , polyfunctional flexible epoxides e.g., Flexibilizer 151 , and mixtures thereof as well as mixtures thereof with co curatives, curing agents, or hardeners which also are well known see Lee and Neville and Bruins, supra .Representative of the co curatives or hardeners which can be used are acid anhydrides such as nadic methyl anhydride,cyclopentanetetracarboxylic dianhydride, pyromellitic anhydride, cis l,2 cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride, and mixtures thereof. In general, the polymerization of cationicallysensitive monomers with the cyclic anhydrides of this invention can be carried out at room temperature for the majority of cationically sensitive monomers, although low temperature e.g., 100C or elevated temperatures e.g., 300 to 2000C, preferably 500 to 1000C , can be used to either subdue the exotherm of polymerization or to accelerate the polymerization. In the case of latent amide catalysts of this invention, temperatures generally in the range of 500 to 250 DC, preferably from 800 to 1500C, can be used. The temperature of polymerization and amount of catalyst will vary and be dependent on the particular cationically sensitive monomer used and the desired application of the polymerized or cured product. The amount of cyclic anhydride or amide derivative thereof to be used as a catalyst in this invention i.e., a catalytically effective amount should be sufficient to effect polymerization of the cationically sensitive monomer under the desired use conditions. Such amount generally will be in the range of about 0.01 to 20 weight percent, preferably 0.5 to 5 weight percent, and most preferably 1 to 2 weight percent, based on the weight of cationically sensitive monomer. Solvents can be used to assist in dissolution of the cyclic anhydride or amide derivative thereof in the cationically sensitive monomer, and are preferred for use with amide derivatives. Representative solvents include acetone, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, acetonitrile, p dioxane, and the dimethyl ether of ethylene glycol glyme . In general, in compositions containing cyclic anhydride catalysts, basic solvents or basic impurities in the monomer are avoided to prevent deactivation of the anhydride catalyst. The curable or polymerizable compositions of this invention, consisting of or consisting essentially of the cationically sensitive monomer s and said cyclic anhydride or amide derivative thereof as catalyst, can be used for applications like those cationically sensitive monomer systems cured with other catalysts, such as epoxides cured with BF3 or the complex of BF3 with diethyl ether. Also, curable compositions of the invention comprising cationically sensitive monomer s , said cyclic anhydride or amide derivative thereof as catalyst, and other adjuvants e.g., fillers, reinforcements, pigments, extenders, plasticizers and surface modifying agents can be prepared in the same manner as compositions containing cationically sensitive monomers, other catalysts, and adjuvants. For example, the curable compositions of this invention can be used as adhesives, caulking and sealing compounds, casting and molding Compounds, potting and encapsulating compounds, impregnating and coating compounds, etc., depending on the particular monomers and or catalyst used. Where the catalyst is used in its latent form, the curable composition can be used as a one component or cured in place system, such capability enhancing its use for the applications mentioned above.One particular application where such capability can be employed is in the electrical arts, where such latently curable compositions can be used to coat or impregnate for insulation or protective purposes electrical motor windings or coils, transformers, capacitors, electrical terminals, cables, and other electrical devices. The curable epoxy composition of this invention can be used to make shaped articles of self supporting, structural, filled or reinforced epoxy resin composites, such as glass fiber cloth reinforced epoxy resin composites, useful, for example, as repair materials. The various fillers, reinforcements, and other particulate materials to be mixed or coated with or dispersed in the curable compositions of this invention to make the composites of this invention, as well as methods of processing these materials in making the composites, and their applications, are those known to the art.

The objects and advantages of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples, but the particular materials and amounts thereof recited in these examples as well as other conditions and details should not be construed to unduly limit this invention. Examples 1 to 8 illustrate the preparation of cyclic anhydrides of this invention. EXAMPLE 1 To a stirred solution of 300 ml of methanol and 50 ml of water, cooled with an ice water bath, was slowly added 50.2 g of 4 fluorosulfonylperfluorobutyryl fluoride.An aqueous base solution containing about 23 g of sodium hydroxide and 23 ml of water was then added with cooling.Additional aqueous base solution was added until the reaction mixture was neutral to pH paper. The reaction mixture was stirred for two hours and filtered to remove sodium fluoride. The filtrate was distilled to remove volatiles and the residue dried on a steam bath giving 51.3 g of the disodium salt of 4 sulfoperfluorobutyric acid, in the form of a white solid. About 20 g of the sodium salt was dissolved in water and ion exchanged using AmberliteIR 120 ion exchange resin. The acidic aqueous solution was evaporated on a steam bath, yielding 16 g of the hydrate of 4 sulfoperfluorobutyric acid. 4 Sulfoperfluorobutyric acid 7.8 g, azoeotropically dried with toluene was mixed in a flask under nitrogen. with 15 g of phosphorus pentoxide. The flask was equipped for distillation under anhydrous conditions and heated with a sand bath to a temperature of 2600C, giving a distillate of 3.2 g of the cyclic anhydride of 4 sulfoperfluorobutyric acid, b.p. 76 780C. The identity of the anhydride was established by infrared, fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance Fnmr , and mass spectral analyses. The anhydride is highly reactive, e.g., reacts with moist air, and is stored under anhydrous conditions. EXAMPLE 2 In a 500 ml three necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, condenser and addition funnel, and containing a cooled solution of 84.9 g 1.52 mol of KOH dissolved in 84.9 g water, was added gradually over about 0.5 hour, at a rate so that the reaction temperature did not exceed about 350C, 69.3 g 0.30 mol of FO2SCF2CF2COF from the electrochemical fluorination ofEMI23.1 Stirring under ambient conditions was continued for about 0.5 hour. The temperature was next raised to about 1000C and stirring continued under these conditions for four hours. The reaction mixture was cooled and the solid crystalline product filtered, rinsed with 50 ml cold water, and the crystals dried under reduced pressure. The yield ofKO3SCF2CF2COOK salt was 52 g. Ten grams of KO3SCF2CF2COOK were dissolved in 30 ml warm water and placed in a 50 cm x 2.5 cm glass column containing a 20 cm bed of Amberlite IR 120 ion exchange resin in the acid H form, which had been previously prepared by treating the column with 6N hydrochloric acid and rinsing with distilled water. The column was eluted with distilled water. The first 150 ml of eluate was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the hydrate of 3 sulfoperfluoropropionic acid, HO3SCF2CF2COOH 8H2O. Tb a stirred mixture of 30 g of phosphorus pentoxide in 50 ml of tris perfluoroamyl amine in a 250 ml, three necked flask fitted with a thermometer, mechanical stirrer and anhydrous nitrogen gas inlet, and connected to a trap cooled to 780C with Dry Ice , was added 5.0 g of HO3SCF2CF2COOH 8H2O. The reaction mixture was heated over a 1.5 hour period to a maximum of 1650C while stirring and purging with a slow stream of nitrogen gas. Warming the 780C trap gave 3.2 g of a colorless liquid, b.p. 54 560C. The infrared spectrum of the liquid was consistent with the structure EMI23.2 EXAMPLE 3 Using the method of Example 1, 50 g of a mixture containing about 75 mol percent 4 fluorosulfonylperfluorobutyryl fluoride and about 25 mol percent of a mixture of 3 fluorÏsulfonyl 2 trifluoromethylperfluoropropionyl fluoride and 3 fluorosulfonyl 3 trifluoromethylperfluoropropionyl fluoride was hydrolyzed with aqueous sodium hydroxide, giving 52.3 g of dry sodium salt mixture.TheFnmr spectrum indicated the presence of a mixture of about 75 moi of the disodium salt of 4 sulfoperfluorobutyric acid and about 12 mol each of the disodium salts of the isomeric acids 3 sulfo 2 trifluoromethylperfluoropropionic acid and 3 sulfo 3 trifluoromethylperfluoropropionic acid. The sodium salt mixture 20 g was ion exchanged giving 16 g of a mixture of the hydrates of the above sulfoperfluoroalkanecarboxylic acids. Mixing of 8.3 g of the above acid hydrates and 17 g of phosphorus pentoxide in a flask followed by heating in a sand bath to a temperature of 2500C gave 3.5 g of distillate b.p., 70 750C which contained the cyclic anhydride of 4 sulfoperfluorobutyric acid as the major component along with about 10 mol each of the cyclic anhydrides of 3 sulfo 2 trifluoromethylperfluoropropionic acid and 3 sulfo 3 trifluoromethylperfluoropropionic acid.The structures of these latter two anhydride compunds are EMI24.1 EXAMPLE 4 To a 500 ml, three necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, condenser and addition funnel, and containing 54.7g 0.97 mole of KOH dissolved in 100 ml water, was added gradually over about 1 hour, with heating about 80DC and stirring, 63.2g 0.20 mole of hexafluoro 1,3 propanedisulfonyl fluoride,FO2SCF2CF2CF2SO2F. Heating and stirring were continued for about three more hours and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool overnight. The reaction product was filtered, washed with 25 ml of cold water, and allowed to air dry, yielding 78 g of fine, white crystals. Infrared analysis of the crystals was consistent with the structure hexafluoro 1,3 propanedisulfonic acid dipotassium salt, K03SCF2CF2CF2S03K . A 9.7g sample of the salt was dissolved in 50 ml of warm water and placed in a 50 cm x 2.5 cm glass column containing a 20 cm bed of ion exchange resin Amberlite IR 120 in the acid H form which had been previously prepared by treating the resin with 6N hydrochloric acid and rinsing with distilled water. The column was eluted with distilled water. The first 100 ml of eluate were concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 7.5g of clear liquid product. The identity of the product was established by infrared spectroscopy, fluorine NMR Fnmr analysis, and water determination, as the hexahydrate of hexafluoro 1,3 propanedisulfonic acid, HO3SCF2CF2CF2SO3H 6H2O. The acid hydrate partially crystallized on standing. A mixture of 11.3g 0.027 mole of the above disulfonic acid hydrate from another run and 30 g of phosphorus pentoxide was heated to 1300C under reduced pressure in a flask adapted for short path distillation. A total of 4.3g colorless liquid product was collected in a trap cooled with Dry Ice to 780C, The liquid product was redistilled, yielding a colorless, non fuming liquid with a boiling range of 109 1100C at atmospheric pressure, 22 n D 1.3562. The product is insoluble in water at room temperature, but hydrolyzes within a few minutes to give a homogeneous solution.Analytical data are consistent with the structure hexafluoro 1,3 propanedisulfonic acid anhydride, EMI26.1 EXAMPLE 5 This example illustrates another method for carrying out the dehydration and cyclization reaction ofEquation 2, above, utilizing an inert, high boiling, fluorinated organic diluent. To a stirred mixture of 30 g of phosphorus pentoxide in 75 ml of tris perfluoroamyl amine, C5F11 3N, in a 250 ml, three necked flask fitted with a thermometer, mechanical stirrer and nitrogen gas inlet, and connected to a trap cooled with Dry Ice to 780C, was added 5.0g of hexafluoro 1,3 propanedisulfonic acid hexahydrate. The resulting mixture was heated over a one hour period to a maximum of 1700C while stirring and purging with a slow stream of nitrogen. Warming the 780C trap gave a colorless liquid weighing 2.4 g 69 yield . The infrared spectrum was consistent with the desired cyclic hexafluoro 1,3 propanedisulfonic acid anhydride. EXAMPLE 6 Using the method of Example 4, cyclic tetrafluoro 1,2 ethanedisulfonic acid anhydride,EMI26.2 b.p. 100 C to 1010C, was prepared. The identity of the liquid anhydride product was established by infrared and Fnmr analysis. The anhydride fumes in moist air, hydrolyzing to form the disulfonic acid hydrate EXAMPLE 7 Using the method of Example 4, cyclic octafluoro 1,4 butanedisulfonic acid anhydride,EMI27.1 b.. 126.50 127.00C, was prepared. The dehydration and cyclization reaction was carried out using sand in the reaction vessel. EXAMPLE 8 Using the method of Example 4, cyclic decafluoro1,5 pentanedisulfonic acid anhydride,EMI27.2 was prepared. The dehydration and cyclization reaction was carried out using sand in the reaction vessel. The next six examples show the preparation of amide derivatives of cyclic anhydrides of this invention. EXAMPLE 9 Under anhydrous conditions, 1.9 g of the mixture of cyclic anhydrides of Example 3 was slowly added to a stirred solution of 1.9 g of diethylamine and 20 ml of diethyl ether in a 100 ml flask cooled with an ice water bath. Formation of a lower phase, insoluble product occurred immediately. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 hour and the ether distilled off. The residue was heated with warm water under reduced pressure giving 2.8 g of an amber oily residue. Analyses of the oil by infrared and Fnmr indicated the presence of a mixture of C2H5 2NC o CF2 3so3 H20 C2H5 2, C2Hs 2NC O CF CF3 CF2SO3 H2t C2Hs 2, and C2H5 2NC O CF2CF CF3 SO3 H2t C2H5 2. EXAMPLE 10 Using the method of Example 9, aniline 1.7 g in 25 ml of diethyl ether was allowed to react with the anhydride of 4 sulfoperfluorobutyric acid 1.1 g , giving a white solid product. After stirring the mixture for 1 hr, 1.0 g of solid product was isolated by filtration.Analyses indicated high purity C6H5NHC o CF2 3so3 H3C6H5. EXAMPLE 11 Under anhydrous conditions, 1.0 g of ammonia was slowly bubbled into a solution of the cyclic anhydride of 3 sulfoperfluoropropionic acid Example 2, 1.0 g which had been dissolved in acetonitrile. The resulting mixture was distilled under reduced pressure, giving 1.0 g of the ammonia reaction product which was a heavy grease soluble in acetone. Analyses by infrared and Fnmr indicated the presence of essentially a 1 1 mixture of NH2C O CF2 3SO3 H4 and NH2SO2 CF2 3CO2 tH4. EXAMPLE 12 About 1.0g of the cyclic hexafluoro 1,3 propanedisulfonic acid anhydride of Example 4 was added dropwise to a stirred 1.0g portion of piperidine which had been cooled to 100C. The dark crude solid product was recrystallized from an ethyl acetate diethyl ether mixture to yield gold colored crystals, m.p. 86 880C. The structure of the mixed sulfonamide sulfonate salt,EMI28.1 was established by infrared analysis. EXAMPLE 13 A reaction product with ammonia was prepared by the slow addition of excess ammonia gas to an anhydrous methylene chloride solution of the cyclic anhydride prepared in Example 4. The resulting solid product was crystallized from a mixture of diethyl ether and carbon tetrachloride to yield white crystals, m.p. 168.5 1690C. Elemental analysis, infrared analysis, and Fnmr spectra were consistent with the structure NH4 O3SCF2CF2CF2SO2NH2. EXAMPLE 14 A reaction product of the cyclic anhydride ofExample 7 with ammonia was prepared by the gradual addition of ammonia gas to a methylene chloride solution of the cyclic anhydride. The product was a white powder. The mixed sulfonamide ammonium salt structure, NH4 O3SCF2 CF2 CF2 CF2 SO2NH2, was established by infrared analysis and Fnmr spectra. The next ten examples show the use of cyclic anhydrides of this invention as catalysts for the polymerization of cationically sensitive monomers.

The flask contents were cooled to 40C with an ice bath, then 2.0g of hexafluoro 1,3 propanedisulfonic acid anhydride was added. A mildly exothermic polymerization reaction ensued, accompanied by increased viscosity of the reaction mixture.After one hour, the ice bath was removed. After three hours, stirring was very difficult. Additional cyclohexane 65g and 120 g of toluene were added to the reaction vessel and the resulting solution was mixed with 100 g of toluene which had been saturated with anhydrous ammonia.The resulting solution was stirred for one hour at room temperature with 16.7g of anion exchange resin AmberliteIRA 402 , then filtered to remove the resin particles. A sample of the NH2 terminated tetramethylene oxide polymer product, H2N C4H8O nC4H8NH2, was isolated from solution and characterized by gel permeation chromatography.

EXAMPLE 26 To a glass vial containing a solution of 0.04 g of the aniline reaction product of Example 10 and about 0.06 g of acetone was added 1.2 g of ERL 4221 epoxy resin. The vial was capped and the mixture heated at 500C for 1 minute giving a clear light yellow fluid. No evidence of polymerization was observed on storage of the fluid at room temperature for 20 hr, indicating latency of the catalyst.

The salt dissolved in the epoxide at room temperature. There was no apparent change in viscosity of the epoxide salt solution after 30 hours at room temperature, but on heating at 1300C for 10 minutes, a clear, nearly colorless brittle solid formed. EXAMPLE 28 In a glass vial was placed about 25 mg ofCH3NHSO2CF2CF2CF2SO3 H2NCH3 prepared using the method ofExample 13, but with CH3NH2 in place of NH3 and 1.0g of ERL 4221 epoxide.
