# FLAME RESISTANT ALKENYL AROMATIC COMPOUNDS AND POLYMERS CONTAINING CHEMICALLY BONDED PHOSPHORUS AND BLENDS WITH POLYPHENYLENE ETHER

## Abstract
Flame retardant alkenyl aromatic compounds which are vinylbenzyl diaryl phosphine oxides and a method for their preparation are described. They may be polymerized into higher molecular weight flame retardant materials which, in turn, may be admixed with polyphenylene ether resins to form thermoplastic flame resistant molding compositions. The present materials are more resistant to losses in the flame retardancy upon thermal processing. e.g., molding, because the active flame retardant agent, phosphorus is chemically bound to the polymeric matrix.
