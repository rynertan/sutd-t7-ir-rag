# Power transmission belts.

## Abstract
A plurality of V belt bodies disposed side by side are connected together over their radially outer surfaces by a tie band T which includes at least one ply of rubbered fabric 5 . The fabric 5 is formed from crimped nylon yarns 5a subjected to woolly treatment extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the belt interwoven with cotton yarns, nylon yarns or polyester yarns 5b extending at right angles to said longitudinal axis. This makes the tie band T and hence the whole belt relatively stretchable in the longitudinal direction but comparatively rigid in the lateral direction, ensuring good conformability of the belt to the pulley grooves in which it runs. In order to reduce the risk of the crimped nylon yarns 5a fraying out of the tie band T , the fabric can be arranged so that these yarns are inclined to the longitudinal axis of the belt at an angle between 0 and 40 . Each V belt body can be covered by a rubbered bias fabric 3 over the whole of its external surface, or only a radially inner surface thereof can be covered by the fabric 3 so that side surfaces thereof are exposed.

## Description
This invention relates to power transmission belts adapted to transmit power from one pulley to another.The invention is intended to overcome the difficulties inherent in so called multi V belts which are adapted to transmit large torques from a driving pulley to a driven pulley. These difficulties include vibration and turn over which are often caused during running of the belt. This invention also aims to eliminate power transmission loss due to the non uniformity in length of the belt elements forming the multi V belt, and to increase the service life of the belt. In a conventional multi V belt drive system, a plurality of belts are laid over pulleys having a plurality of pulley grooves in such a manner that each belt engages a respective one of the pulley grooves.In the case where the multi V belt system is employed for driving a machine such as a crusher or a compressor which generates a relatively great impact load, the belts are liable to be vibrated separately and to be brought into contact with one another. As a result the belts may be turned over or may come off the pulleys, and may be prematurely damaged. A V belt is driven through friction, and therefore it is necessary to apply a suitable tension to the belt before it is run. However, in the conventional multi V belt system the belts are liable to be non uniform in tension because their lengths are not uniform, and as a result the belts are vibrated and the service lives thereof are shortened. In order to overcome these difficulties, a power transmission belt has been proposed in which the upper surfaces of individual V belt bodies are connected with a tie band formed with a wide cross angle fabric. Because wide cross angle fabric is used, the belt is high in lengthwise stretchability because the angle in the widthwise direction is small. Accordingly, the belt cannot satisfactorily engage with the pulley, and the tie band is liable to peel off the belt. Thus, the proposed belt is still disadvantageous. A power transmission belt using a nylon cord fabric as its tie band is also known in the art. This belt has excellent stretchability in the longitudinal direction.However, when the belt is used with a small diameter pulley, the rubber interposed between the cords of the fabric is excessively stretched and accordingly is liable to become cracked. Since nylon cord fabric is used, the stretchability of the belt in the lateral direction is low, and therefore the belt cannot suitably engage the pulley, It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the above described difficulties accompanying conventional power transmission belts, and to provide a power transmission belt having a tie band which is stretchable only in the longitudinal direction. According to the invention , the tie band includes at least one layer of fabric composed of yarns high in stretchability which extend generally longitudinally of the belt interwoven with yarns high in rigidity which extend transversely of the belt. The yarns high in stretchability are preferably crimped nylon yarns subjected to woolly treatment, whereas the yarns high in rigidity can be cotton yarns, nylon yarns or polyester yarns. The yarns high in stretchability advantageously form an angle of between O and 40 with the longitudinal axis of the belt. The fabric can be a plain weave fabric or a twill weave fabric. The present invention will now be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 are perspective views, partly cut away, of two embodiments of a power transmission belt according to the present invention Figure 3 is a plan view of a fabric which forms part of a tie band of the belts shown in Figures 1 and 2 Figure 4 is a diagram indicating one way in which the fabric shown in Figure 3 can be woven Figures 5 and 6 illustrate one manner in which the fabric shown in Figure 3 can be produced Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the manner of production of an alternative form of fabric Figure 9 is a perspective view, partly cut away, of a third embodiment of a power transmission belt according to the present invention which utilises the fabric shown in Figures 7 and 8 Figure 10 is a plan view of a further aLternative form of fabric which can be used in the tie band and Figure 11 illustrates a method of winding the fabric shown in Figure 10 around V belt bodies of the power transmission belt. Referring first to Figure 1, the power transmission belt shown therein comprises a plurality of V belt bodies disposed side byside and whose radially outer surfaces are joined together by a tie band T. Each V belt body includes a layer 1 of tensile members made of a rope of fibres such as polyester fibres, nylon fibres, rayon fibres, or aromatic polyamide fibres Kevlar which are high in strength. A compression rubber layer 2 is provided inwardly of the layer 1, while a core rubber layer 2t is provided outwarly thereof. The external surface of each V belt body is covered by a rubbered bias fabric 3 made of cotton yarns. Thus, each V belt body takes the form of an ordinary wrapped V belt. The tie band T is obtained by covering the upper and lower surfaces of a stretchable fabric 5 with rubber 4 so as to form a unitary structure. More particularly, in order to improve its stretchability in the longitudinal direction and its rigidity inihe lateral direction of the belt, the tie band T is manufactured by weaving the fabric 5 from warps 5a comprising stretchable crimped nylon yarns subjected to woolly treatment and wefts 5b comprising cotton yarns, nylon yarns or polyester yarns.high in rigidity, the fabric 5 then being embedded in the flexible rubber 4 which is equal in quality to the rubber of the layers 2 and 2 in the V belt bodies. In the finished belt, the crimped nylon yarns subjected to woolly treatment extend parallel to the longitudinal axis of the belt, while the cotton yarns, nylon yarns or polyester yarns extend at right angles to said longitudinal axis. An ordinary plain weave fabric which is stretchable only in the longitudinal direction of the belt may be employed in the tie band T. However, it is preferred to employ a twill weave fabric for the following reason. In a twill weave fabric, the warps 5a and wefts 5b each have at least three yarns interlaced with one another to show diagonal lines on the surface. The warps 5 and wefts 5b form wavy cross points every two yarns, and therefore the number of wavy cross points in the twill weave fabric is much smaller than that in the ordinary plain weave fabric. Accordingly, it is possible to fill the spaces between the yarns at the cross points sufficietly with the rubber 4 and thereby prevent the warps 5a and the wefts 5b from coming into contact with one another when the belt is bent. This results in an improvement in the service life of the belt. Figures 3 and 4 show one example of a fabric which can be used in the tie band of the power transmission belt described above. In this fabric, warps 5a made of crimped nylon yarns made stretchable through woolly treatment and wefts 5b made of ordinary nylon yarns, cotton yarns or polyester yarns are woven in a twill weave pattern.As shown in Figure 4, in the woven pattern a first warp 1 appears over a weft F1, then disappears under the next two wefts F2 and F3, and then appears over the fourth weft F4. A second warp W2 next to the warp 1 disappears under the weft Fl appears over the next weft F2 and disappears under the wefts F3 and F4. A third warp kJ3 ne.t to the warp W2 disappears under the wefts Fl and F2 and then appears over the weft F3 and so forth.If this woven pattern is viewed from the point of the wefts, the weft Fl disappears under the warp W1 and then appears over the warps W2 and W3. The weft F2 appears over te warp W1, then disappears under the warp B2, and appears over the warps W3 and W4. he third weft F3 appears over the warps Jl and W2 and then disappears under the warps 3 and so forth. Since the warps and the wefts are interlaced with one another in this way, the positions of the visible warps and wefts move stepwise diagonally across the fabric.As a result a woven pattern having oblique lines running across the fabric is defined. Jith respect to the connection of the tie band T made of the fabric shown in Figures 3 and 4 to the V belt bodies, it is unnccessary to arrange for the tie band T to have a wide angle unlike in a conventional power transmission belt because the warps 52 which run generally longitudinally of te belt have been treated so as to be stretchable. That is, as shown in the eut away part of Figure 1, the relatively rigid wefts 5b form an angle of 90 C with the longitudinal axis of the belt. The tie band T may be bonded to the V belt bodies with an adhesive because the rubber 4 incorporating the stretchable fabric 5 is equal in guality to the rubbers 2 end 2 of the V belt bodies. owever, it is advisable for the tie band and the V belt bodies to be conibined together strongly as one unit in the process of vuleanisation. In addition, it is preferable that a U shaped thir groove 6 be formed between adjacent V belt bodies and in the radially inner surface of the tie band T. Figure 2 shows a second embodiment of a power transmission belt, in which the structure of the tie band T and the connection gthe tie band to the V belt bodies are similar to the belt shown in Figure 1.However, in the belt shown in Figure 2, only the radially inner surface of each V belt body is covered with a rubbered bias fabric 3 thus, the sides thereof are not covered with the fabric so that the rubber is exposed at these points. The power transmission belt shown inFigure 2 can thus be regarded as a plurality of raw edge type V belts connected together by a tie band. Since the side of the V belt bodies are not covered by the fabric 3, their coefficient of friction is higher than that of the wrapped V belt bodies shown in Figure 1, and accordingly the power transmission performance of the belt is higher. In the above described examples, only one ply of stretchable fabric 5 is employed in the tie band however, it should be noted that the invention is not limited thereto or thereby. That is, two or more plys of stretchable fabric can be used for forming the tie band depending on requirements of actual use. In summary, the power transmission belts described above comprise a plurality of V belt bodies connected together by a tie band which is obtained by embedding a particular fabric in rubber, the fabric being woven from warps of stretchable crimped yarn subjected to woolly cotton yarn, treatment and wefts of nylon yarn or polyester yarn,such that the number of cross points between the warps and wefts is small. The fabric is oriented so that the wefts form an angle of 900 with the longitudinal asis of the belt.Accordingly, when compared with a conventional multi V belt or a conventional multi rib belt obtained by connecting V belt bodies with a tie band, the stretchability of the power transmission belt according to the invention in the longitudinal direction is considerably high. With the power transmission belt according to the invention, problems such as vibration, turn over and removal which occur frequently with conventional power transmission belts can effectively be prevented, the belt life is increased, and the power transmission performance is improved. Power transmission belts are greatly affected by the conditions in which they are used, and especially by heat and water sometimes the width of the belt is changed by these factors, as a result of which the belt cannot satisfactorily engage the pulley.However, this difficulty is effectively eliminated by the power transmission belt of the invention, because the wefts 5b are cotton yarns, nylon yarns or polyester yarns high in rigidity. A method of producing the fabric for incorporation in the tie band T will now be described with reference to Fpres 5 and 6. As shown in Figure 5, a plain weave fabric or a twill weave fabric is initially produced by weaving wefts 5a made of crimped nylon yarn subjected to woolly treatment and warps 5b made of cotton yarn, nylon yarn or polyester yarn. The fabric 5 thus obtained is cut along lines L parallel to the wefts 5a into several pieces of equal width W, these pieces then being connected together along lines J as indicated inFigure 6 to form a long fabric. The wefts 5a of the original fabric now extend in the longitudinal direction and the warps 5b extend in the lateral direction of the fabric. The long fabric 5 thus obtained is embedded in the connecting rubber 4 of the tie band T in such a manner that the crimped nylon yarns 5a subjected to woolly treatment extend in the lengthwise direction of the belt, and the cotton yarns, nylon yarns or polyester yarns 5D extend in the widthwise direction of the belt. Accordingly, the stretchability in the longitudinal direction of the belt is improved, and changes in the widthwise dimension of the belt can to a certain extent be limited. The wefts 5b of the fabric embedded in the rubber a must be yarns such as cotton yarns, nylon yarns or polyester yarns which are low in stretchability but high in rigidity. If the yarns are excessively stretchable or cannot stretch at all, the belt cannot satisfactorily engage the pulley. Therefore, in order to permit the belt to engage the pulley sufficiently, the yarn must have a suitable stretchability. In view of this, the most suitable nylon yarns are thosewhich are stretched by a relatively large amount by heat generated during rurning of the belt. In both of the above described embodiments, the plain weave fabric or twill weave fabric is embedded in the rubber 4 of the tie band T in such a manner that the wefts 5b are at right angles to the lengthwise direction of the belt. That is, the warps 5 are exposed on the sides of the tie band T and are therefore liable to be frayed out of the sides thereof. This difficulty can be overcome by arranging the fabric 5 in such a manner that the direction of extent of the warps is oblique with respect to the longitudinal axis of the belt as indicated in Figure 9. Figures 7 and 8 illustrate one way in which the fabric 5 shown in Figure 9 can be produced. Referring to Figure 7, a plain weave or twill weave fabric is first obtained by weaving wefts 5a of crimped nylon arn and warps 5b of cotton yarn, nylon yarn or polyester yarn, similarly as in the case of Figure 5. The fabric is then cut along linesL which inclined at an angle e to the wefts 5a into several pieces of fabric having the same width W These pieces of fabric are connected together along lines J as shown inFigure 8 to form a long fabric in which the wefts 5a are inclined at an angle e to the lengthwise direction of the fabric.The long fabric thus formed is embedded in the rubber layer 4 of the tie band T, with the result that the wefts 5a which are made of stretchable nylon yarn subjected to woolly treatment form an angle e with the longitudinal axis of the belt. The angle e is in general arranged to be betweenO to 40 degrees. If the angle e is larger than 40 degrees, then the direction of extent of the stretchable wefts 5a approaches the widthwise direction of the belt. As a result, the stretchability in the lengthwise direction of the belt is decreased, and the width of the belt is subject to dimensional changes, thus making engagement of the belt with the pulley unsatisfactory. The modified long fabrics shown in Figures 6 and 8 are obtained by cutting an original woven fabric laterally or obliquely into several pieces, and joining these pieces of fabric together in a different arrangement. The places where these pieces are joined together i.e. along the linesJ or J are therefore thicker than the remainder of the fabric. Accordingly, when the long fabric is embedded in the rubber 4 of the tie band T, the thickness of the tie band T becomes non uniform, which may cause the belt to vibrate during running thereof. This difficulty can be eliminated by using a plain weave fabric or a twill weave fabric which is obtained by weaving warps 5a of crimped nylon yarn subjected to woolly treatment and wefts 5b of cotton yarn, nylon yarn or polyester yarn in the manner shown in Figure 10.Unlike the fabrics shown in Figures 6 and 8, it is unnecessary to cut the fabric into several pieces and to join these pieces together again.In other words, the fabric 5 can be used as it is. When only a single ply of fabric 5 is embedded in the rubber 4 of the tie band, no joints are created.In the case there at least two plys of fabric 5 are embedded in the tie band, if as shown in Figure 11 the fabric 5 with a thin rubber layer 4 bonded thereto is wound spirally around the radially outer surfaces of a plurality of V belt bodies 2 , then unlike the cases of Figures 6 and 8 no joints are created in the fabric. Therefore, if the fabric is spirally wound in succession in this manner, a belt having a uniform thickness can be obtained. As is apparent from the above description, power transmission belts according to the present invention are obtained by connecting together the radially outer surfaces of a plurality of V belt bodies using a tie band in which a fabric stretchable in the longitudinal direction and rigid in the lateral direction is embedded. The resulting power transmission belt has the following merits 1 Since a plain weave fabric or twill weave fabric is used in which crimped nylon yarns subjected to woolly treatment are employed as warps, the stretchability of the belt is excellent when compared with conventional multi Vbelts or conventional power transmission belts obtained by connecting V belt bodies with a tie band. It is possible to prevent the belt from vibrating, turning over, and coming off the pulley.In addition, the service life and the power transmission performance of the belt can be increased. 2 Since a plain weave fabric or twill weave fabric obtained by weaving warps of crimped nylon yarn subjected to woolly treatment and wefts of cotton yarn, nylon yarn or polyester yarn high in rigidity and low in stretchability is arranged in the tie band in such a manner that the stretchable warps extend in the lengthwise direction of the belt, the flexibility of the belt is increased in the longitudinal direction of the latter. The width of the belt does not change significantly under undesirable conditions such as the presence of heat or water, and therefore the belt can be satisfactorily engaged with the pulley at all times.
