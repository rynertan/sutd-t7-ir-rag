# Bottle cap.

## Abstract
A bottle cap of the tear off type, particularly an easy to open cap for wide mouth bottles, in which a central top wall which covers the top portion of the mouth of the bottle is connected to a lateral band which surrounds the opening of the neck of the bottle and is bent under the edge of the neck to grip the cap, and a tear off tab, bounded by one or more score lines, extends from the top wall through the lateral band and an angular sealing is interposed between the mouth of the bottle and the top wall and the lateral band. The angular sealing is bonded to the undersurface of the central top wall at a bond area inside the score line or lines, where by, when the cap is broken by lifting the central top wall by means of the tear tab, the angular sealing is lifted with the central top wall in one piece and slips off from underneath the lateral band thereby freeing or loosening the lateral band from the mouth of the bottle. The sealing can also be bonded to the tear tab at the area bounded by the score line or lines towards the lateral band, to make the lifting of the sealing itself along with the central top wall easier, without breaking it.
