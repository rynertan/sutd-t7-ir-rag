# Communications cables.

## Abstract
An improved metallic screen 20, 22 for use in electrical cable constructions 10 , such as communications cables, is provided wherein the metallic screen 20, 22 is coated with a protective coating which comprises a layer of a polymer selected for its properties of high flexural modulus, high tensile strength and high melting point and an adhesive layer comprising a random, block or graft copolymer of an olefin and a polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, acid anhydride, or derivative. Optionally, the adhesive layer may comprise a blend of the copolymer and a polyolefin.
