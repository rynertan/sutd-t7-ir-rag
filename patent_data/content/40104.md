## Description
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a crystalline aluminosilicate composition and a method for the production thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to mordenite having a high silica content and a novel method for the production thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a crystals line aluminosilicate composition having a high catalytic activity, acid resistance and thermal stability and also having a mordenite framework structure of a high silica alumina ratio. Mordenite, which is one of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites, has an alurninosilicate framework which is based on an infinitely extending threedimensional network of SiO4 and A104 tetrahedra linked to each other by sharing all of the oxygens. In mordenite, the main channels are al2 membered oxygen ring and the other channels are an 8 membered oxygen.ring generally having the following chemical formula Na20 A1203 lOSiO2 6H20 Like other minerals comprising crystalline aluminosilicate, mordenite releases its intercrystalline water without the breaking of the crystalline structure if it is heated to a temperature of about 300 4000C, thereby forming the main channels having dimension of 6 x 7 . Because of the existence of these channels, therefore, synthetic mordenite is used as catalyst and catalyst carrier for the cracking of various. hydrocarbons and also as an effective adsorbent like numerous other crystalline aluminosilicates. However, when synthetic mordenite is to be used for catalytic dewaxing, production of. aromatic compounds and production. of hydrocarbons by alcohol conversion, the activity thereof must be further improved by treating the same with a mineral acid to remove aluminum, thereby increasing the silica alumina ratio.However, the amount of aluminum which can be removed is limited from the viewpoint of thermal stability, acid strength and the maintenance of the crystal structure, since Si O Si bond in the mordenite crystalline structure is changed to Si O H by the dealumination reaction.Further, if the dealumination reaction is carried out in such a manner that silica alumina molar ratio is taken to above a certain level,the crystal structure is destroyed. Thus, in using mordenite as a catalyst, activity thereof has been limited in the prior art, though a higher activity has been required.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figs. 1 to 5 show X ray diffractio patterns of the synthetic, crystalline aluminosilicate compositions obtained by the process of the present invention. Fig. 6 shows carbon number distribution of a liquid hydrocarbon product according to gas chromatography. After intensive investigations and experiments, a method has been found for producing a crystalline aluminosilicate from substantially inorganic reaction materials having an SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of at least 15 and having a mordenite framewor structure which exhibits remarkable shape selectivity and catalyst performance. A main object of the present invention is to provide a crystalline aluminiosilicate composition of mordenite type having a high silica content, i.e. an SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of at least 15 and also having high thermal stability, acid resistance and catalytic activity. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for directly producing a crystalline, aluminosilicate of mordenite type having a high silica content and an SiO2 Al2 0 molar ratio of above about 15 in the aqueous reaction mixture in the hydrothermal reaction without necessitating acid treatment. According to the present invention, the above objects can be attained effectively. The present invention relates to a synthetic, crystalline aluminosilicate composition having the following chemical composition in terms of molar ratios of oxides 0.5 3.0M2 nO.Al2O3.15 30SiO30 50H2O wherein M is at least one metallic cation and n is a valence of the metallic cation and also having an X ray powder diffraction pattern having a d spacing as shown in Table 1.

Very Strong The above values were determined by standard techniques. The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper, and a scintillation counter spectrometer with a strip chart pen recorder was used. The peak heights,I and the positions as a function of 2 times theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart. The relative intensities, I Io, where I is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, 0 and d, the interplanar spacing in Angstrom units, corresponding to the recorded lines, were calculated. The crystalline aluminosilicate of the present invention has the highest relative intensity at an interplanar spacing of 9.15 A.From the X ray powder diffraction pattern, it is understood that the framework structure of the crystalline aluminosilicate of the present invention is the same as a framework structure of conventional mordenite. The present invention also relates to a method for producing the above crystalline aluninosilicate composition. More particularly, the present invention also provides a method for producing a crystalline aluminosilicate composition which comprises preparing an aqueous reaction mixture substantially comprising in organic reaction materials of the following molar ratios of oxides SiO2 A1203 16 50 Na2O SiO2 0.05 1.5 Na2O M2 nO 5i62 0 05 1.5 H2O Na2O M2 nO 100 1200 wherein M is at least one metallic cation and n is the valence of the metallic cation, and maintaining the mixture at a temperature in the range of about 150 200 C under an autogenous pressure for about 10 40 hours. A preferred composition of the aqueous reaction mixture is as follows molar ratios of oxides SiO2 A1203 16 35 Na2O SiO2 0.05 0.50 Na20 M2 nO SiO2 0.05 0.50 H2O Na2O M2 nO 100 1000 The most suitable range of the proportion of the components of the aqueous mixture is as follows molar ratios of oxides SiO2 Al2O3 16 30 Na2O M2 nO SiO2 0.08 0.25 H2O Na2O M2 nO 100 1000 wherein M is at least one metallic cation selected from the group consisting of Groups I and TI in the PeriodicTable, particularly, sodium, lithium, barium, calcium and strontium, most preferably lithium and n represents the valence of the metallic cation. M2 nO and Na2 0 are both in the free form.They are generally in the form of hydroxide or an extremely weak acid salt effective in the zeolite synthesis such as aluminate or silicate. Free Na2O can be controlled by the addiction of aluminum sulfate, sulfuric acid or nitric acid. The oxides of the above composition used in the preparation of the aqueous reaction mixture are those generally used in the preparation of synthetic zeolites. For example, silica sources are sodium silicate, silica gel, silicic acid, dissolved silica, aqueous colloidal silica sol, powdery silica and amorpnous silica.As alumina sources, there may be used various aluminum salts such as activated alumina, alumina, alumina trihydrate, sodiumaluminate and. aluminum chloride, nitrate and sulfate. The metal oxide of the formula M2 nO is added to the reaction mixture in the form of a watersoluble salt or hydroxide thereof. Na2O used as sodium cation source is added in the form of sodium hydroxide, sodium aluminate or sodium silicate. Li2 0 used as lithium cation source is added in the form of its hydroxide, halide, sulfate, nitrate, chlorate LiClO4 or the like.The aqueous reaction mixture is prepared by mixing the above silica source, alumina source, alkali source and water together Particularly preferred silica sources are sodium silicate, water glass and colloidal silica.Particularly preferred alumina sources are sodium aluminate and aluminum sulfate. In the production of the crystalline aluminosilicate having a high silica content of the present invention, water content of the aqueous reaction mixture is important. As described above1 the reaction mixture should contain at least 100 moles,. preferably at least 300 500 moles, of water per mole of Na2O M2 nC By controlling the water content in the above described range, the mixing and stirring of the gel reactants are facilitated. As described above, after mixing the reagents, the reaction mixture is maintained at a temperature in the range of about 150 2000C for about 10 40 hours under an autogenous pressure. The crystallinity of the crystallized product can be further improved and the formation of amorphous aluminosilicate can be prevented by adding a mineralizer to the aqueous reaction mixture in the crystallization.As the mineralizers, there may be used salts of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals such as NaCl, Na2CO3,Na2SO4, Na2SeO4, KC1, RBr, KF, Back2 and Babr2. The amount of the mineralizer is preferably such that molar ratio of X SiO2 wherein X represents an anion of the salt used as the mineralizer if the anion has a valence of n, one valence equivalent thereof is taken , is in the range of about 0.01 20. The resulting crystalline aluminosilicate is separated out of the solution by filtration, washed with water and dried. After drying, the product is calcined at a temperature of above 2000C in air or an inert gas atmosphere to remove intercrystalline water.Thus, the dehydrated product is useful as a catalyst for chemical reaction or catalyst carrier. Further, it is preferred to remove or to exchange at least a part of the cation in the product by thermal treatment and or ion exchange. The cation exchanged product is effective particularly as a catalyst for hydrocarbon conversion.A cation species used for the ion exchange may be selected depending upon the intended reaction. Among them, at least one cation selected from the group consisting of metals of Groups IIa, IIIa, IVa, Ib, IIb, IIIb, IVb and VIII is preferred. In addition, the cation in the product can be exchanged with hydrogen ion by the treatment with an acid or by the combination of the ion exchange with NH4 with the thermal treatment. Exchanging cations preferred for the cracking, isomerization and alkylation of hydrocarbons are hydrogen ion and cations of metals of Group VIII in the Periodic Table. The cation exchange may be effected by con tacting the crystallized product with salt s of desired exchanging cation s . In this step, various salts may be used. Particularly, chlorides, nitrates, sulfates and acetates are preferred. Framework aluminum can be removed and silica alumina ratio can be increased to above 30 by contacting the hydrogen ion exchanged crystalline aluminosilicate of the invention with an acid extraction. As a result, the acid strength and catalytic activity can be improved further. In the case of mordenite zeolite used in the prior art, it is difficult to attain a high silica alumina ratio by a conventional extraction treatment with an acid. Under the circumstances as above, specific processes such as a process wherein the combination of an acid extraction with steaming is employed or a process wherein multi stage extraction treatment with an acid have been proposed. However, when the crystalline aluminosilicate of mordenite type having a high silica content according to the present invention is used, the silica alumina ratio can be increased remarkably without destroying the crystalline structure as will be described below. As preferred acids used in the extraction treatment, there may be mentioned various mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid as well as organic acids such as acetic acid and formic acid. Among them, hydrochloric acid is particularly preferred. The concentration of the acid used is in the range of 1 to 12 N. The temperature in the process of the extraction with an acid ranges from room temperature to about 950C. The higher the temperature, the better. For example, by effecting the acid treatment with 3N hydrochloric acid at 900C for 4 hours, silica alumina molar ratio of the starting crystalline aluminosilicate mordenite type can be converted from 20 to 35. It has been found that after this treatment, crystallinity of the product was substantially unchanged as compared with that of the starting material.By the above described process, crystalline aluminosilicate having a silica alumina molar ratio of at least about 600 700 can be obtained. Thus, the present invention relates to a synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate composition having the following chemical composition in terms of molar ratios of oxides 0.5 3M2 n0.Al2O3.15 30SiO2.0 50H2O wherein M represents a metallic cation and n is the valence of the metallic cation and also having an X ray powder diffraction pattern having d spacing as shown inTable 1, and a process for the production of said composition.

The cracking reaction of n hexane was effected in a glass reactor. The new crystalline aluminosilicate HSM was ion exchanged with 5 NH4Cl solution at 800C for 1.5 hours. The ion exchange was repeated four times. Then1 the L H4 type HSM was calcined at 600 CC for 3 hours to obtain H type zeolite. Preparation of alumina binder A solution of 202g of sodium aluminate NaA102 in 264g of water H20 was added to an ion exchanged water 4800g kept at 700C. Then, a solution of 288g of aluminum sulfate A12 S04 3 17.8E20 in 507g of water H20 was added thereto and the whole was aged for one hour. Thereafter, the mixture was filtered and washed to obtain an aluminum hydrogel. reparation of pellets The new crystalline aluminosilicate HSM of H type obtained as above was mixed with the alumina binder in such as ratio that weight ratio of them after the calcination would be 7 3. The mixture was kneaded well together with water and then extrusion molded to obtain pellets of a diameter of l.5mm. The pellets were dried and then calcined at 6000C for 3 hours to obtain a catalyst. Evaluation of activity n Hexane cracking reaction was carried out as follows 3.2my. of the catalyst ground into 16 30 mesh was charged in a glass reactor. Then, 3.2my, of silica chips also ground into 16 30 mesh was placed over the catalyst bed to facilitate the diffusion and heating of the reactants. The catalyst bed was kept at 3000C. n Hexane was charged in a saturator kept at 100C. Nitrogen gas was introduced therein as a carrier gas so that n hexane concentration in the nitrogen gas would be 10 . After a certain period of time has passed after the introduction of the n hexane nitrogen mixture in the reactor, a residual amount of n hexane was measured by gas chromatograph. From the residual amount and the amount of n hexane in the feed, conversion was calculated. Thereafter, air was introduced in the reactor, and carbonaceous substances deposited on the catalyst were burnt at 500 C to recover the fresh condition of the catalyst. Space velocity was altered and the experiment was effected again. Conversions of n hexane at 300 C and 2750C were thus determined to obtain the results shown in Table 4.From the results, it is understood that the new crystalline aluminosilicate obtained in Example 1 had a high n hexane cracking activity.

The mixture was charged in a glass reactor. The catalyst bed was kept in nitrogen stream at 5000C for 2 hours. Then, the temperature was lowered to 3700C in the nitrogen stream and the whole was kept at that temperature. Then, the supply of nitrogen stream was stopped and methanol was introduced rapidly at a rate of 4.5m1. hr. in the reactor. After one hour, the methanol injection was stopped and nitrogen was introduced again therein to purge the reaction product and unreacted reactants from the reactor. The product discharge from the reactor was cooled with water at 200C to separate the same into a gaseous product and a liquid product mixture of water and hydrocarbons . The resulting liquid product had the following composition Hydrocarbons 0.5g Water 1.93g The theoretical quantity of water to be formed was 1.99g. Yield of water was thus 97, Carbon number distribution of the liquid hydro carbons according to gas chromatography is shown in Fig. 6. The composition of the gaseous product was as shown in Table 5.

The liquid product comprised substantially methanol and contained only a trace of hydrocarbons. From the above results, it is apparent that the synthetic, crystalline aluminosilicate HSM of the present invention has a high catalytic activity.
