## Description
NOVEL COMPOUNDS This invention relates to novel compounds having anti allergy activity, to a process for their preparation1 and to pharmaceutical compositions containing then. It is generally recognised that certain cells, eg mast cells are activated by antibody antigen com binations and release substances which mediate an allergic response. In European Patent Application No 79301318.6 Publication No 0007727 is disclosed a class of 9 oxo 1H,9H benzonyrano 2,3 d v triazole derivatives which inhibit this type of antigen induced response in marm,als, and are therefore of value in the prophylaxis of diseases in which the symptoms are con troll by mediators of the allergic response. Examples of such diseases include bronchial asthma, rhinitis, hayfever and allergic eczema. The compounds disclosed in the said EuropeanPatent Application have the formula A EMI1.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, whereinR1, R27 R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, represent hydrogen, halogen, nitro, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy, or any adjacent two of R1 to R4 taken together represent an alkylene group containing from 3 to 5 carbon atoms or a 1,4 buta 1,3 dienyZene group. A novel class of compounds structurally distinct from the compounds of formula A has no been discovered. These new compounds have anti allergy activity of the type described above for the compounds of the formula A . Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of the formula I EMI2.1 and pharaceutically acceptable salts thereof rein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above in relation to a compound of formula A ,n is 0, 1 or 2, and the S O bond represents a single dative bond when n is 1 and a double bond when n is 2. By lower alkyl and lower alkoxy we nean such groups containing up to six carbon atoms Examples of suitable lower alkyl groups whichR1 to R4 represent include methyl, ethyl and n propyl, more suitably methyl. Examples of suitable lower alkoxy groups whichR1 and R4 represent include methoxy, ethoxy and n propoxy. Examples of suitable halogens which R1 to R4 represent include fluorine and chlorine. Often R1, R2, R3 and R4 will be selected from hydrogen and lower alkyl. Where compounds of formula I are highly substituted, it is appreciated that substituents R1 to R are selected for steric compatability. 4 The triazole moiety of the compounds of formula I has an acidic hydrogen, and accordingly may form salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts falling.within the scope of this invention include the aluminium, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts such as the sodium, potassium and magnesium salts and salts with ammonia, organic bases and amino compounds Suitably in the compounds of the formula I at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is hydrocen. ore suitably in the co.nounds of the formula I at least two of R1, 92 R3 and i4 are hydrogen. Preferably in the compounds of the formula I R1 and R4 are hydrogen, and R2 and R3 are selected from methyl, ethyl and n and iso propyl. In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of the formula I wherein the triazole moiety is protected with a protecting group.These compounds are not pharmaceutically active, but are useful as intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of formula I . Suitable examples of protecting groups for the triazole moiety include labile benzyl groups such as C16 alkoxy substituted benzyl groups, for example, p methoxybenzyl groups. The invention further provides a process for preparing a compound of formula I which process comprises the intramolecular cyclisation of a compound of formula II EMI4.1 wherein R1 to R are as defined with reference to formula I above, the triazole moiety is optionally protected, and X is hydroxyl or an active substituent such that COX is an acylating derivative, in the presence of a cyclising agent, and thereafter where desired or necessary deprotecting the triazole moiety, oxidising the resultant protected compound wherein n is O to the corresponding compounds wherein n is 1 or 2 and then deprotecting the triazole moiety, and or salifying the product so obtained. When X is hydroxyl, the cyclisation is suitably carried out in the presence of polyphosphoric acid or phosphorous pentoxide and methane sulphonic acid. In the case of polyphosphoric acid a diluent such as acetic acid may be used, and a temperature of 80 10O0C is suitable. Examples of active substituents include halides ieX is halogen particularly the chloride and bromide.Where X is a halogen the cyclising agent is suitably aFriedel Crafts catalyst, examples of which include aluminium chloride and stannic chloride, and the reaction is suitably carried out at around 0 C. Where desired, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a solvent or diluent which is inert to the reagents and products. Where the cyclisation is carried out using Friedel Crafts catalyst, suitable solvents or diluents include chlorinated alkanes such as methylene chloride, ethylene chloride and chloroform. When the cyclisation is carried out with polyphosphoric acid or phosphorous pentoxide and methane sulphonic acid, it is generally unnecessary to add a diluent. As noted above, optionally the triazole moiety of the compound of formula II may be protected. We have found this particularly useful when a Friedel Crafts cyclisation reaction is used. Suitable examples of protecting groups for the triazole moiety are those mentioned above as suitable for protecting the compounds of formula I and include labile benzyl groups such as C 1 6 alkoxy substituted benzyl groups, for example pmethoxybenzyl groups. Such protecting groups may be removed after the cyclisation reaction in any convenient manner, for example by acid catalysis. It is preferable to use the p methoxybenzyl protecting group which is readily removed after the cyclisation reaction using trifluoroacetic acid, the course of the cleavage being followed by hplc or NMR spectroscopy. Suitable temperatures of around 40 700C can be used, with a suitable reaction time being around 2 8 hours. Other strong acids such as methane sulphonic acid behave similarly, but are less efficient. On occasions, it will be found that the reaction conditions for the cyclisation reaction will be sufficient to effect the necessary deprotection after cyclisation without a further, separate, reaction step being required. We would note that we have found it possible to use a benzyl protecting group, and to remove that group after the cyclisation reaction with sodium in liquid ammonia but we presently believe this route to be less preferred. The conpounds of formula I wherein n is 1 or 2 may be prepared from the corresponding N protected compounds of the formula IA EMI6.1 wherein R1 to R4 are as defined in formula I , n is O and Q is a protecting group, by oxidation, followed by deprotection. Preferably the protecting group is located at theN 3 atom on the triazole ring. The protection of the compound of formula I where n is 0 may be carried out by alkylating the said compound with a C16 alkoxybenzyl halide, preferably p methoxybenzyl chloride. The oxidation conditions may be chosen as appropriate so as to give a mixture of compounds of formula IA wherein n is 1 or 2, or the compound wherein n is 2 alone.The latter may be achieved be oxidation with potassium permanganate. The mixture may be obtained by using milder oxidation conditions, for example, by oxidation with an organic peracid, suitably in an organic medium. The proportions of the two compounds in the mixture may be adjusted by varying the concentrations of reactants and the reaction conditions. The mixture may be readily separated into its component compounds by conventional techniques such as liquid chromatography. It will be appreciated from the above that the compounds of formula IA wherein n is 2 may be prepared from the corresponding compounds of formula IA wherein n is 1, by oxidation. After the oxidation the protecting group may be removed in the manner described above to give the compound of formula I , preferably by using trifluoroacetic acid. It will be appreciated that certain compounds of the formula I with non symmetrical R1 to R4 substituents will give a mixture of isomers after the cyclisation step.Such isomers may, of course, be separated by conventional techniques, for example fractional recrystallisation and chromatography. Salts of the compounds of formula I may be prepared in the usual manner, which is to react the free acid form of the compound of the formula I with the appropriate free base. Compounds of formula II wherein COX is an acylating derivative may be prepared from the corresponding compound of the formula II wherein X is OH in any of the usual ways of making a conversion of this kind. For example oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride may be used to form an X is C1 compound. Compounds of the formula II wherein X is OH may be prepared by the alkaline hydrolysis of a compound of formula III , which like the compounds of formula II may optionally be protected EMI7.1 wherein R5 is C14 alkyl, such as ethyl. Such hydrolysis may suitably be achieved with aqueous sodium hydroxide at a temperature of, for example, 40 1000C. Compounds of the formula III may themselves be prepared by reacting a compound of formula IV EMI8.1 with a compound of formula V EMI8.2 wherein Y is a leaving group such as a nalo, for example chloro, and Q is a protecing group, such as those described previously and thereafter if the desired compound of formula III is unprotected, removing the protetinggroup 0. The reaction between compounds of formulae IV and V is suitably carried out by forming the anion of the compound of formula IV with a strong base such as sodium hydride, in N,N dimethylformamide. Suitably this reaction is carried out at around 800C for 6 24 hours. The compounds of formulae IV and V are either known compounds, or may be prepared in analogous manner to known compounds. The intermediates of formulae 11 and III , and protected derivatives thereof, are believed to be novel, and thus as useful intermediates form an important aspect of this invention. As noted hereinbefore, the compounds of the formula I and their salts may be used in the treatment of allergies, such as bronchial asthma, rhinitis, hayfever and allergic eczema. In order to use the compounds of the invention as medicinal agents in this way, they will be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with standard pharmaceutical procedure. The invention also includes a phar,maceutical corn position comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Compounds of formula I may be administered topically or systemically. Topical formulations for administration to the skin include lotions and creams. Topical formulations for administration to the respiratory tract include solutions for application via a nebulizer or as an aerosol, or as a snuff or a microfine insufflatable powder. The active ingredient in an insufflatable powder has a small particle size i.e. less than 50 microns and preferably less than 10 microns. The active material is co presented with a solid carrier such as lactose which has a particle size of less than 50 microns. Systemic administration may be achieved by rectal, oral or parenteral administration. A typical suppos i.or formulation comprises the active coocnd with a binding agent and or lubiricating agent such as gelatin or cocoa butter or other low melting vegetable waxes or fats. Typical parenteral compositions comprise a solution or suspension of the active material in a sterile aqueous carrier of parenterally acceptable oil. Compounds of formula I which are active when given orally may be compounded in the form of syrups, tablets, capsules and lozenges. A syrup formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound in a suitable liquid carrier such as ethyl alcohol, glycerine or water with a flavouring or colouring agent. Where the composition is in the form of a capsule, the solid in granular form optionally with a binding agent is encased in a gelatin shell.there the composition is in the form of a tablet, any suitable pharmaceutical carrier routinely used for preparing solid formulations may be used. Examples of such carriers include magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, glucose, sucrose, rice flour and chalk. Preferably the cc osition is in unit dose form such as a pill, capsule or metered aerosol so that the patient may administer to himself a single dose. there appropriate, small amounts of anti asthr.atics and bronchodilators for example sympathomir,etic amines such as isoprenaline, isoetharine, salbutamol, phenyl shrine and ephedrine xanthine derivatives such as theophylline and aminophylline and corticosteroids such as prednisolone and adrenal stimulants such as nC1H ray be included. As in cordon practice, the compositions will usually be accorpanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned, in this case as an anti allergic at for treament of, for example, asthma, hay fever or rhinitis. In any of the foregoing formulations, a suitable dosage unit might contain from 1 to 500 mg of active ingredient. The effective dose of compound of formula I depends on the particular compound employed, the condition of the patient and on the frequency and route of administration, but in general is in the range from 0.01 mg kg day to 50 mg kg day of the patient s body weight.

Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis PCA Serum containing heat labile homocytotropic antibody was raised in rats to crystallised ovalbumin Grade 3Sigma by the Method of I. Mota Immunology 7, 681 1964 using Bordetella pertussis vaccine 4 x 10 10 organisms mlBurroughs Welcome as adjuvant. Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis PCA was carried out by a method based on that of Ovary and Bier, Proc. Soc.Exp. Bio. Med., 81 584 1952 as modified by Goose andBlair Immunology, 16, 749 1969 Male Sprague Dawley rats 230 340 gm were given 0.1 ml of each of six two fold serial dilutions of pooled antiserum in 0.9 saline Polyfusor Boots injected intradermally into separate sites on their shaved backs. 72 Hours later the rats were challenged by intravenous injection of 0.3 ml of a 1 solution of ovalbumin in isotonic saline buffered with 0.05M, pH 7.2 Sorenson Buffer Bactohaemagglutination buffer Difco Laboratories , mixed with 0.2 ml of a 5 solution of Pontamine Sky Blue 6 BX C.1. 24410 Raymond ALamb in isotonic saline. The rats were killed after 20 minutes and the diameter of the blue wheals at the antibody injection sites was measured on the outer surface of the skin. The starting dilution of the serum was adjusted so that there was no response, after challenge, at the injection site of the highest dilution and a maximum response at the lowest dilutions. Typically, six twofold serial dilutions of the serum from 1 4 to 1 128 were used. Compounds were tested for their ability to reduce the diameter of the wheals at those intradermal sites which in control animals gave less than maximum response. Each dose of the compounds was administered to six rats at a measured time prior to intravenous challenge with ovalbumin. Control groups of six rats were given the same volume 0.2 ml 1009 of carrier fluid at the same time prior to the challenge. The results were calculated as follows S inhibition of PCA 100 1 a b where a the sum of the diameters of the wheals produced in the test animal at the sites of antibody dilutions as used in control groups and b the mean sum of the diameters of the wheals produced in the control group of animals at those antibody sites where at least five out of six of the animals gave less than maximum response.A typical variation in the control group of animals was SEM 6.
