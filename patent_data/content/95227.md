# A method for evaluating the quality of the bond between two members utilizing thermoacoustic microscopy.

## Abstract
Acoustic waves are excited in the two members 20, 30 by periodic localised heating, so as to excite plate mode resonances. Detection 50 of the waves produces a plate mode signature for comparison with a reference, taking advantage of the fact that the plate mode signature of a securely bonded die and substrate combination and a poorly bonded combination will be different. The signature may be represented by variation of detected signal as a function of frequency by varying the frequency of heating and or of position by scaning in two dimensions . The method is particularly suited for analysing the integrity of a bond between an integrated circuit die and a substrate.
