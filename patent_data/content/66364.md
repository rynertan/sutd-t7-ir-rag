# Sectioned cabinet for room air conditioning unit.

## Abstract
A cabinet for a vertical room air conditioning unit includes an upper section 12 and a separate lower section 13 having substantially similar cross sectional dimensions to permit mating of adjacent ends when the upper section 12 is stacked upon the lower section 13 in a use position. Securing means, including tabs 20 and screws 21 hold the sections together in the use position, and the upper section acts as a plenum or air duct for the unit. For shipment or storage, the upper section 12 telescopes down onto the lower section 13 after having been rotated 180 or also 90 in the preferred embodiment , to form a compact space saving package.
