# Valve assembly.

## Abstract
A valve assembly is disclosed for permitting relatively free flow in a first direction and for preventing flow in the path in a second, opposite direction. The assembly includes a resi lient flow regulator 54 including a pair of lips 56 arranged to define a normally closed slit 62 at the outer ends of the lips. An annular flange 66 extends outwardly about the opposite end of the regulator. A housing outlet portion 50 defines a housing interior having an outlet port and an open sealing end, with an annular collar 76 disposed outwardly about the sealing end. The regulator is disposed within the housing outlet portion with the flange contained within the collar. A cover plate 84 is attached to the collar for securing the regulator and for sealing the housing. The housing outlet portion defines a first sealing ring 78 and the cover plate defines a second sealing 96 such that the first and second sealing rings are disposed on opposite sides of the flange. At least one of the sealing rings includes a bevel, defined so that the flange 66 is compressed between the sealing rings 78, 96 to a greater degree along the portion of the flange adjacent the lip bases than the portion of the flange adjacent the collar. The beveled surfaces thereby center and align the regulator within the housing and prevent distortion in the flange region of the regulator from being transmitted to the outer ends of the lips.
