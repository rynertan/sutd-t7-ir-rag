# Training device for nuclear power plant operators.

## Abstract
A simulated nuclear energy power plant system with visi ble internal working components comprising a reactor 11 adapted to contain a liquid with heating elements 12 sub merged in the liquid and capable of heating the liquid to an ele vated temperature, a steam generator 22, 22A containing wa ter and a heat exchanger means 19, 19A to receive the liquid at an elevated temperature, transform the water to steam, and return the spent liquid to the reactor a steam turbine 29 re ceiving high energy steam to drive the turbine and discharging low energy steam to a condenser 27 where the low energy steam is condensed to water which is returned to the steam generator an electric generator 28 driven by the turbine in dicating means 15 to identify the physical status of the reac tor and its contents and manual and automatic controls 14 to selectively established normal or abnormal operating condi tions in the reactor, steam generator, pressurizer 24 , turbine, electric generator, condenser, and pumps 37, 37A and to be selectively adjusted to bring the reactor to acceptable operat ing condition after being placed in an abnormal operation. This device is particularly useful as an education device in demon strating nuclear reactor operations and in training operating personnel for nuclear reactor systems and also as a device for conducting research on various safety systems to improve the safety of nuclear power plants.
