# A FRAME STRIP FOR RECEIVING THE EDGE OF A SHEET MATERIAL

## Abstract
A frame strip 12 for use in window frames or other arrangements for securing the edge of either a flexible sheet 20 or a rigid sheet 25 provides a strip member incorporat ing a cavity having two sides 16, 17 . One side 16 is straight and the other side is generally parallel to the first side and incorporates a first portion 171 and a second portion 172 , the first portion being closer to the first side than the second portion and being interconnected by a curved section 174 . The space between the first portion 171 and the first side 16 is sufficient to receive the narrow side of a rectangular locking member 19 , the other side of which is shorter than the distance between the edge of the interconnecting portion 174 and the bottom of the cavity 173 and longer than the space between the second portion 172 and the first side 16 so that the locking member is prevented from rotation within the cavity to retain a flexible sheet wrapped therearound. A rigid sheet can also be supported by the same frame strip with the flexible sheet and locking member removed by the insertion into the cavity of a foam bead 26 . The strips 12 can be assembled into a rigid rectangular frame with corner members 80, 90 .
