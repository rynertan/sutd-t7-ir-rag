# Releasable locking device.

## Abstract
A device for retaining a parked vehicle against a loading dock or the like during loading or unloading thereof includes a pivotally mounted hook like member movable between operative and inoperative modes. The member is secured to the front side of the loading dock D by a carriage C having a first section 13 on which the hook like member is mounted, and a second section affixed to the dock front side 11 . The first section 13 is adjustable relative to the second section in a substantially vertical plane. The first section 13 is biased to normally assume a predetermined rest position which is at a maximum elevation with respect to the roadway R support ing the vehicle. Power means is mounted on the carriage first section 13 and actuates the hook like member between the operative and inoperative modes. When in an operative mode, the hook like member interlocklingly engages the parked vehicle. When in an inoperative mode, the hook like member assumes a vehicle release position. Manual control means are provided for regulating the operation of the power means. The carriage first section 13 includes an outwardly projecting cam segment 13a which is engaged by the vehicle when being maneuvered into a parked position and will cause the first section 13 to move vertically downwardly thereby enabling the member to interlockingly engage the vehicle in response to the manual adjustment of the control means.
