# A device for drying a web shaped material.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an arrangement in drying sections of the kind intended for drying material 2 , in the form of a web, which is arranged for movement through the drying section while supported by a plurality of air streams which impinge on the undersurface of the web and which extend parallel with, or substantially parallel with a plane allotted to the web, each of these air streams being given an exiting velocity and direction, via nozzle like exit apertures 11, 11a formed in a blow box 7 , such as to maintain the web 2 in a suspended state above the blow box 7 . Arranged in that end part 8 of a blow box through which a flow of supply air 7a is introduced thereinto is a means 20 operative in reducing and or eliminating and or over compensating the influence of the velocity vector 7a of the flow of supply air 7a on the direction in which the air streams exit from the blow box through nozzle like exit apertures 11, 11a formed therein and located adjacent the end part 8 of the blow box. The interior of the blow box is divided into two chambers, a first chamber 71 intended for receiving the incoming flow of supply air 7a and a second chamber 72 intended for receiving an air flow 7b, 7c separated from the incoming air flow, this separated air flow having a velocity vector which is considerably smaller than the velocity vector 7a of the air flow entering the first chamber 71 and preferably having a direction opposite to the firstmentioned velocity vector.
