# Filter for removing cancer causing compounds from exhaust fumes.

## Abstract
Industrial exhaust polyaromatic hydrocarbons are readily absorbed by flowing through a bed of dry porous pellets con sisting of a mixture of natural magnesium silicate selected from short chrysotile asbestos fibers, attapulgite and mixtures thereof with a cementitious clay binder, the latter representing from 1 to 20 by weight of the dry pellets, whereby substan tially all the particulate and gaseous pollutants present in the exhaust material are adsorbed by the dry porous pellets.
