# Operating mechanisms for electrical switches.

## Abstract
A latching mechanism 52 for a reciprocable actuating means 34 which has a short linear reciprocable stroke between two opposed positions at opposed ends of the actuating stroke. The actuating means is designed for op erating an electrical shunt switch 12 useful with electro chemical cells. The latching mechanism operates to main tain the switch contacts 14, 16 in either the open contact or closed contact positions until a positive unlatching force is applied to permit movement of the contacts.
