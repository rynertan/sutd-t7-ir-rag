# Cylinder block of internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A cylinder block 20 of internal combustion engine comprises bearing sections 42A, 42B for supporting a rotatable shaft disposed within a crankcase inner chamber 36 , the bearing sections being spaced from each other and from main bearing sections 40 for supporting a crankshaft 34 . The cylinder block includes generally cylindrical hollow beam members 44A, 44B, 44C each of which is interposed between the two opposite bearing sections in a manner to cover the rotatable shaft supported by the bearing sections 42A, 42B , the hollow beam members being aligned in the direction of the row of cylinder barrels 22 . The invention provides increasing the total rigidity of the cylinder block 20 while achieving engine weight lightening and lowering the noise level.
