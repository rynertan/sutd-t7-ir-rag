# APPARATUS FOR READING A LINE MARKING FIXED TO A CARRIER

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises an optical arrangement 23 which displays longitudinal extending short or long ele ments 14, 17 of a marking 12 in time sequence on a reading surface 28 . The surface 28 is divided into more than three consecutive sectors 35 to 44 and a pulse signal indicating an element of any length is produced if an element is displayed on at least one sector. A code signal indicating a long element is produced if an element is displayed simul taneously on at least two sectors which are separated from each other by at least one other sector.
