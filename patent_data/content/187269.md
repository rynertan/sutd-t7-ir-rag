The invention is concerned with a circular knitting machine incorporating a device for setting the work knitting cams, in particular for hose knitting. The device comprises a slide 4 movable in a substantially perpendicular direction to the axis of the needle cylinder 5 and being rigidly associ ated with a knitting cam 6 selectively engageable with the needle 8 butts 7 , and is characterized in that it comprises a step motor 9 actuated by an electronic machine control 50 . The step motor 9 is connected to a drive cam 14 which engages with a cam follower 18 carried on the cited slide 4 to produce a preset displacement of the knitting cam 6 with respect to the needle cylinder 5 on account of the knitting cam 6 engaging selectively the needle 8 butts 7 .
