# Brake slack adjuster.

## Abstract
Brake forces are transitted to the friction discs not shown of a multi disc brake by a thrust plate 11 via a two part plunger 14,15 . As known per se a frictional ring 21 movable between fixed abutments 18.20 limits retrac tion of the outer plunger part 14 relative to a fixed housing 13 . According to the invention load is transmitted between the plunger part 14,15 in all telescopic positions by a freely rotatable shank 41 biassed by a spring 27 so that its frusto conical end 24 is maintained in contact with a surface 23 of the outer plunger part 14 . Then shank 41 engages the inner plunger part 15 over screw threads 42 of high helix angle.
