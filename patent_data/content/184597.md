# Lens finishing apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for finishing or polishing a surface of a lens with a finishing tool. The apparatus includes a main frame 12 , a shaft 74 pivotally mounted on the main frame 12 , and eccentric drive means 68, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84 driving the shaft 74 in a predetermined orbital motion. Lens finishing means 126 are fixedly secured to one end of the shaft 74 . A lens carrier 182 is slidably mounted on the main frame 12 such as to be reciprocable along a path normal to the orbital axis of the shaft 74 . The lens is removably mounted on the carrier 182 and is biased by a biasing device 178, 180 against the lens finishing means 126 .
