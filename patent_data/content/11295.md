## Description
This invention relates to a new class of water insoluble yellow monoazo dyes. These dyes are confirming to formula k EMI1.1 wherein R1 and R2 are indifferently hydrogen atoms, alkyls having up to 4 carbon atoms, phenyls, also substituted X is an atom selected from amongst hydrogen, chlorine and bromine, or it is an alkyl group, an alkoxyl group, a carboxyl ester group having up to 4 carbon atoms, a carboxyl group, a group CF3, CN, N02, SO2CH3, a sulphonamide group, and n is an integer selected from among 1, 2 and 3. The present invention relates furthermore to the preparation of the dyes of formula I and the use of same. The dyes object of this invention are particularly suitable for dyeing and printing hydrophobic synthetic fibres, in particular polyester fibres, with yellow shades. These dyes, when applicated according to the usual dyeing and printing methods, provide on these materials dyeings and printings endowed with a high tinctorial strength and excellent general characteristics. In particular the dyes of the present invention exhibit a high stability to light, to wet treatments and to heat treatments. These dyes result also suitable for applications of the Thermosol type 190 2200C . The dyes of the present invention have furthermore exhibited an 62tellent behaviour in the dyeing and printing of polyester cotton blended fibres, according to known processes used at present, as they have all the main characteristics required for this application, i.e. a good affinity for polyester fibres, affinity for cotton in the presence of swelling agents, possibility of obtaining dyeings with very slight diffe rences of shades on the two fibres. As far as the Applicant knows, the class of dyes comprised in formula I and object of the present invention is neither known nor has been described so far. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new class of azo dyes having particularly interesting applications in Uhe fields specified hereinbefore. This and still further objects, which will more clearly appear to those skilled in the Art, can be achieved, according to this invention, by the class of compounds having formula I and by the process for preparing same, characterized in that a 1 phenyl 3 amino pyrazol of formula II EMI2.1 wherein fl1, R2, X and n have the meanings specified herein before, is diazotized at a temperature ranging from 0 to 50C approximately, and is then coupled with a compound of formula III EMI3.1 at a temperature ranging approximately from 50 to 200C.The coupling compound employed III permits to operate at pH values comprised between about 3 and 10. More in particular, and according to an embodiment of the present invention, the dyes forming the object of this invention are obtained by diazotizing, according to substantially conventional methods, the l phenyl 3 amino pyrazols of formula II as defined hereinbefore, and by successively coupling, in an acid to basic medium, the diazopyrazols obtained on 2 hydroxy dibenzofuran of formula III . According to another effective ambodiment, the dyes of the present invention can be also prepared by oxidative diazotization of l phenyl 3 amino pyrazolins having formula IV EMI3.2 wherein R1, R2, X and n have the meanings indicated herein above in this manner it is possible to obtain the corresponding diazopyrazols, which are then coupled on 2 hydroxy dibenzofuran of formula III , as explained hereinbefore. The abovesaid oxidative diazotation of the pyrazolins of formula IV is efficaciously conducted, for example, according to the method forming the object of Italian patent application No. 23725 A 78, according to which the amino pyrazolins of formula IV are treated with nitrous acid in a ratio of from 2 1 to 5 1 in respect ofamino py razolins IV , in an organic acid medium acetic or propionic acid or in an inorganic acid medium hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, etc. at a temperature in the range of from lO0C to 2O0C. The nitrous acid, in its turn, is prepared from alkaline or alkyl nitrites, or from nitrosyl sulphuric acid. The resulting acid solution is ready to be used for the coupling with compound III according to the first embodi ment described herein. Sphenyl 3 amino pyrazolins IV can be prepared by conventional methods. For example, l phenyl 3 amino pyrazolin of formula IV , where R R Xii ilfoid Lid., British 12 patent No. 679.678 , can be obtained by condensing phenylhydrazine with acrylonitrile in a basic medium. 1 phenyl 3 amino pyrazols II can be obtained, in their turn, by oxidizing the corresponding pyrazolins IV , for example with chloranil in xylene C. Alberti. Il Farmaco Ed. Sc. vol. XIX, issue 7, page 63 , or by flowing of air through an inert solvent alcohols, acetic acid, aceto nitrile in the presence of copper salts CuC1, CuCl2, acetate at about 20 C 40 C, as described in Belgian patcnt application No. 855,944 filed by the Applicant. Finally, 2 hydroxycdibenzofuran III can be prepared for example from 2 2 chlorophenyl hydroquinone by heating with NaOH or KOH US patent No. 2,172,572 .Among the l phenyl 3 amino pyrazols II and the 1 phenyl 3 amino pyrazolins IV employed for obtaining compounds I , the following may be cited 1 phenyl amino pyrazol, 1,5 diphenyl 3 amino pyrazol, l 3 tolyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 2 chlorophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 3 chlorophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 4 chlorophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 4 methoxyphenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 4 bromophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 2 ,4 dichlorophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 2 ,5 dichlorophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 3 ,4 dichlorophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 2 ,4 ,5 trichlorophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 3 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 3 carboxymethylesterphenyl 3 amino pyrazol, l phenyl 3 amino 4 methyl pyrazol, 1 3 chlorophenyl 3 amino 5 phenyl pyrazol, 1 3 nitrophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 4 nitrophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 3 cyanophenyl 3 amino pyrazol, 1 4 sulphpmethylphenyl 3 amino pyrazol, l phenyl 3 amino 5 methyl pyrazolin, 1 3 tolyl 3 amino 4 methyl pyrazoline, l 4 ethoxyphenyl 3 amino pyrazolin, 1 3 bromophenyl 3 amino pyrazolin, 1 2 ,6 dichlorophenyl 3 amino pyrazolin, 1 2 ,5 dibromophenyl 3 amino pyrazolin, l 3 ,4 dibromophenyl 3 amino pyrazolin, 1 3 ,4 ,5 tribromophenyl 3 amino pyrazolin, 1 2 ,4 dinitrophenyl 3 amino pyrazolin, 1 4 cyanophenyl 3 amino pyrazolin, 1 3 ,5 dimethoxyphenyl 3 amino pyrazolin, 1 4 chlorophenyl 3 amino 5 phenyl pyrazolin, l 4 sulphamidophenyl 3 amino pyrazolin.
