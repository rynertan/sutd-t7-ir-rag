## Description
RECORD DISC REPRODUCING APPARATUSField of the Invention This invention relates to a record disc reproducing apparatus, and more particularly, to a digital audio disc player which is able to stably track a track formed on a disc.Background of the Invention There have recently been provided digital record discs for recording data signals such as audio signals or image signals and record disc reproducing apparatus for reproducing the recorded data. The digital record disc of such a type is so arranged that digital data intended for high density recording are recorded in the form of a spiral bit string on one side thereon and reproduced through reading the bit string by means of an optical pickup using laser beams.Moreover, the record disc reproducing apparatus is used to read the recorded data by making the optical pickup follow the bit string recorded to the track of the digital record disc by a tracking control system and to process the read out signal in a predetermined manner so as to convert the signal into the original analogue form signal before recording, for example, an audio or video signal as an output. As well known, the digital data accompanied by an address data indicating the address of the digital data is written to the program area of the digital record disc. For instance, in aCD compact disc type digital record disc hereinafter called simply a disc , digital data as audio signals in a digital farm and their digital data track numbers, indexes and addresses, and address data indicating absolute time after the reproduction of the disc is started are recorded. A record disc reproducing apparatus for the CD type disc is provided with a high speed pickup carrying function performing a fast forward or fast reverse operation mode to reproduce a desired digital data readily and selectively, and an address search function performing the automatic retrieval of the desired address data within the enormous amount of the data on the disc. The above described high speed pickup carrying function works so that, when it detects that the fast forward or fast reverse operation button or key has been operated, the pickup is correspondingly moved in the positive or opposite radial direction of the disc at high speed by, for instance, a pickup carriage motor. Then the high speed pickup carrying function is performed. When the search operation button or key has been operated to cause the fast forwarding or fast reversing of the pickup to be automat ca1Iy tarried out, so that the desired address is retrieved. On the other hand, to ensure that the search function can be quickly made only by designatinj the track number and the index on the disc, Table Of Contents data hereinafter called TOC data indicating the digital data on the starting addresses that is, absolute time of the digital data to which ech of the track numbers is allotted are recorded in the read ln area thereof. In other words, the record disc reproducing apparatus is so arranged that it stores the TOC data in the lead in area and that it makes the search function by automatically ering to the starting address corresponding to the track number designated. As a result, the digital data can readily be reproduced with ease. AS for the digital data recorded on the CD type disc, the prescribed number of frames constitutes one data block, and are accompanied by the prescribed units of subcodes in addition to the data converted from audio signals in the form of PCM pulse code moduration . Among them, c subcode Q is an address data and the like for the recorded data and has a format shown inFig. 1. One unit of the subcode Q reproduced in the program area is, as shown, formed with the data reproduced in the order of the following items 1 Sot Sls 2 bits synchronous pattern data section indicatiang the start of the subcode O 2 CNT 4 bits control data section distinguishing between two channel program and four channel program, and indicating a presence or an absence of pre emphasis and a permission or a prohibition of copying O 0 x O s 2 ch., emphasis OFF I o x 0 s 4 ch., emphasis ON O O x 1 2 ch., emphasis OFF 1 o x 1 s 4 ch,, emphasis ON x x o x prohibition of copying x x 1 x permission of copying 3 ADR 4 bits mode data section indicating the data mode of the subcode 0 Mode 1 BCD 1 s Address Mode Mode 2 BCD 2 Disc Catalogue Number Mode Mode 3 BCD 3 2 Special Information Mode 4 MNR 8 bits 2 figures in BCD program number index data section 5 X 8 bits sub index data section of the program 6 MIN 8 bits first, minate data section indicating the order of minute within the time elapsed since the reproduction of the presecribed program number was commenced hereinafter referred as relative time 7 SEC 8 bits first second data section indicating the order of second within the relative time 8 FRAME 8 bits first decimal place of second data section indicating the order of decimal of second , dividing one second with prescribed digit number, e.g. 75, withy the relative time 9 ZERO Section composed of 8 bits digital 0 10 AMIN 8 bits second minute data soction indicating the order of minites within the time elapsed since the reproductlon were started from the read in area hereinafter referred as absolute time , which represents the location or the address of the prescribed data 11 ASEC 8 bits second second data section indicating .the order of seconds within the absolute time 12 AFRAME 8 bits second decimal place of second data section indicating the order of decimal place of e ond , dividing one second with the prescribed digit number, e.g. 75, within the absolute time and 13 CRC s 16 bits error check code data sec Mgn1ft e subcode Qs The subcode Q formed with the above format is extracted by the record disc reproducing apparatus and not only the state in which each data of, for instance, MNR, X, MIN, SEC is being reproduced but also the state in which the pickup is being fast fed are displayed by the display unit of the record disc reproducing apparatus, so that the desired address can readily be retrieved. However, since the pickup of the record disc reproducing apparatus thus constructed is not allowed to come in contact with the disc1 it is necessary to arrango the pickup in such a manner as to perform servo operation, assuring that it always eaPrles o thwacking on the track. Moreover, the spot of the light beam radiated by the pickup on the disc is about 1 m or less in size and easily affected by the dust and scratches thereon and this forms one of the reasons for which the servo operation is readily disturbed. In other words, when the record disc reproducing apparatus carries out tracking on the disc with dust and scratches, it tends to jump across tracks and fail to satisfactorily perform the reproduction of the disc. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a superior record disc reproducing apparatus capable of the reproducing data stably out of a disc wearing some dust and scratches without track interlacing. This and other objects of the present invention are achieved in the record disc reproducing apparatus for use in reproduction data by moving a pickup along the radial direction of a disc for recording digital data associated with digital data indicating the addresses of the digital data is characterised by first means for putting a record disc reproducting system in a playback state when a playback operation key or button is operated and sequentially producing reference addresses being recorded on the disc, second means for comparing the address with the reproduction address on the disc obtrained by produced from the pickup and third means for controlling the movement of the pickup so that the address of the digital data conforming to the reference address can be produced accoring to the results of comparison made by the second means. Additional objects, advantages, and features of the present invention will further become appararent to persons skilled in the art from a study of the following descriptt on and of the accompanying drawings, in which BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a diagram illustrating the format of a subcode 0 being recorded to a disc Fig. 2 is a circuit block diagram illustrating one embodiment of the record disc reproducing apparatus in accordance with the present invention Figs 3 a , b are diagrams, each is explanatory of a kick pulse and another with opposite polarity Fig. 4 is a flowchart explanatory of the featured operation of the record disc reproducing apparatus of Fig 2 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFE EMBODIMENTS Referring now to the drawingS an exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described. Fig. 2 shows a disc record reproducing apparatus in accordance with the present invention, wherein a record disc reproducing system 10 is so controlled as to establish a preselected state by operating switches 12, 14, 161 18 and 20 as operation keys for respectively playback operation, stop operation, fast forward operation, fast reverse operation and search operation through a microprocessor 22 connected thereto through an interface circuit not shown . In other words, when the microprocessor 22 in the record disc reproducing system 10 operates to drive a disc drive motor 24 connected to an output port Pt1 thereof, digital data stored in a disc 26 are reproduced as an RF signal by a pickup 28.The reproduced RF signal is sent to an RF signal detection circuit 30. The RF signal detection circuit 30 separates a pickup servo signal to be supplied to a servo circuit 32 from another to be supplied to a detnodulating circuit 34. The servo circuit 32 sends various signals to the pickup 28 for servo controlling purposes, including focusing and tracking control. The demodulating circuit 34 separates an address signal component for detecting address data from the reproduced signal and supplies the address signal component to an address detector 36, whereas the demodulating circuit 34 generates a demodulated signal EFM signal and supplies the signal to a D A Digital to Analog converter 38. The address data detected from the address detector 36 is allied to an input port Pt2 of the microprocessor 22. If the address data is the aforementioned TOC data reproduced from the disc 26 during the reproduction of the lead in area of the disc 26, the microprocessor 22 stores the TOC data into a RAM RandomAccess Memory 40 so that the TOC data is used to perform the control function necessary for making a search operationWhile, if the address data detected from the address detector 36 is the data reproduced from the disc 26 during the reproduction of the program area of the disc 30, the microprocessor 22 transmits the address data to a display unit 42. The reproduced digtal data reset in the form of an analog signal by the D A converter 38 is subjected to the necessary error correction and memory interleaving and used to drive and sound a loudspeaker 44. The microprocessor 22 is so arranged that it is driven by a prescribed operation program stored in a ROM Read Only Memory 46. For instance, when the fast forward operation key 16 is operated with the operation program of the ROM 46, the microprocessor 22 generates a three states kick pulse KPa consisting of positive and negative pulses at the fore and rear parts thereof as shown in Fig. 3 and sends the kick pulse KPa to a pickup carriage motor 48 from another output port Pt3 thereof. The kick pulse KPa is applied to the pickup carriage motor 48 through an output control circuit 50 which is discribed in detail later. Accordingly the pickup 28 is carried in the outward direction of the disc 26 at high speed while the positive pulse of the kick pulse KPa is applied through the output control circuit 50 and then the energizing force for the pickup 28 is attenuated while the negative pulse of the kick pulse KPa is applied. As a result, a laser beam of the pickup 28 is made to move at high speed in the outward direction of the disc 26 whenever the kick pulse KPa is supplied and the record disc reproducing apparatus is caused to perform the fast forward operation. On the other hand, when the fast reverse operation key 18 is operated, the microprocessor 22 supplies another three states kick pulse KPb consisting of negative and positive pulses at the fore and rear parts thereof as shown in Fig. 3 in opposite to the kick pulse KPa, from the output port Pt3 to the pickup carriage motor 48 through the output control circuit 50.Consequently the laser beam of the pickup 28 is moved to the inward direction of the disc 26 whenever the kick pulse KPb is WtpUtt s that the record dust repro uc iny appara u performs the fast reverse operation. Simultaneously when the search operation key 20 is operated, the microprocessor 22 keeps performing the fast forward operation or fast reverse operation according to the difference between an address obtainable by the address detector 36 thereinafter called a reproduction address Ap and another which should be retrieved until the reproduction address Apconforms to the one which sould be retrieved. Moreover, when the stop operation key 14 is operated, the microprocessor 22 stops the pickup carriage motor 48 to carry the pickup 28 by a stop signal generated from an output port Pt4 of the microprocessor 22. While the microprocessor 22 also stops the disc drive motor 24 to rotate the disc 26 so as to bring the record disc reproducing system 10 to a standstill, thus making the disc 26 attachable and detachable to and from the apparatus. When the playback operation key 12 is operated, the microprocessor 22 first places the record disc reproducing system 10 in a playback state and presets a reference address generator 52 c nncted to rsn output port Ptf thereof with the reproduction address Ap supplied from the address detector 36.The reference address generator 52 is so arranged, for instance, conventionally comprised of a presettable counter and an oscillator, to generate a reference address Ar which is equivalent to the reproduction address Ap but which is generated independently of the reproduction address Ap after the preset of the reference address generator 52. The reference address Ar generated from the reference address generator 52 is applied to one of the inputs of an address comparator 54 comprised of a conventional digital comparator while the reproduction addressAp from the address detector 36 is applied to another input of the address comparator 54. The address comparator 54 is so arranged to compare the reproduction address Ap from the address detector 36 with the reference address Ar from the reference address generator 52 and then generates a compared result signal varying in correspondence to the difference between the reproduction address Ap and the reference address Ar. The compared result signal is applied to another input port Pt6 of the microprocessor 22. The microprocessor 22 generates at the output port Pt3 the kick pulse KPa or KPb in accordance to the polarity of the compared result signal applied to the input portPt6. That is, for instance, the address comparator 54 produces a positive signal when the reproduction address Ap from the address detector 36 is smaller than the reference address Ar from the reference address generator 52.While Mt address comparator 54 produces a negative signal when the reproduction address Ap is larger than the reference address Ar. Then the microprocessor 22 generates the kick pulse KPa or KPb in accordance to the positive or the negative compared result signal. The kick pulse KPa or KPb generated in the playback operation has a pulse width shorter than that generated in the search operation. On the other hand, the output control circuit 50 is so arranged to dlsting the pulse width of the kick pulse KPa or KPb being longer or shorter than the prescribed value and deliver the kick pulse KPa or KPb to the pickup carriage motor 48 or the pickup 28, according to the pulse width of the kick pulse KPa or KPb being longer or shorter than the prescribed value. Thus, the kick pulse KPa or KPb generated in the search operation and having relatively long pulse width is controlled to be applied to the pickup carriage motor 48 by the output control circuit 50. While the kick pulse KPa or KPb generated in the playback operation and having relatively short pulse width is controlled to be applied to the pickup 28.The positive or negative pulse at the forepart of the kick pulse KPa or KPb applied to the pickup 28 drives a tracking actuator not shown in the pickup 28 so that the laser beam moves in outward or inward direction of the disc 26 for the pulse will 7 Pk positive or negative forepart pulse. During the application of the forepart pulse of the kick pulse KPa or KPb to the tracking actuator, the servo circuit 32 drives the pickup carriage motor 48 in outward or inward direction of the disc 26 according to the tracking error signal caused by the movement of the tracking actuat r so as to compensate the tracking error. The rearpart pulse of the kick pulse SPa or KPb is set to have the pulse width of a half of the forepart pulse by the microprocessor 22 80 that the rearpart pulse drives the tracking actuator to be quickly restored without overdriving the tracking actuator in the opposite direction. Further, the kick pulse KPa or KPb is controlled its pulse width in accordance to the compared result signal, in other words, the difference between the reproduction address Ap and the reference address Ar. When the difference between the reproduction and reference addresses Ap and Ar corresponds to an address value indicating one or two or three tracks divergence, etc., the microprocessor 22 generates the kick pulse KPa or KPb with one or two or three units length s pulse width, etc.Therefore, the pickup 28 jumps on the different track of the disc 26 apart from the present tracing track by one or two or three tracks, etc., according to the respective pulse widths of the kick pulse KPa or KPb. The operation of the record disc reproducing apparatus according to the present invention is illustrated in Fig. 4.When the playback operation key 12 is operated as shown by the process Psl, the microprocessor 22 places the disc reproducing system 10 in the playback operatIon msd Next, the microprocessor 22 presets the reference address generator 52 with the reproduction address Ap and then drives the reference address generator 52 to cause it to generate the reference address Ar as shown by the process Ps2. Subsequently, the address comparator 54 compares the reproduction address Ap with the reference address Ar and determines whether they conform to each other as shown by the process Pa3. When the reproduction address Ap conforms to the reference address Ar, the disc reproducing system 10 continues the playback operation as it is without applying the kick pulse to the pickup 28 as shown by the process Ps4. The above state means that the pickup 2B is tracing the right track of the disc 26.When the reproduction address Ap differs to the reference address Ar, on the contrary, the microprocessor 22 moves the pickup 28 by predetermined tracks so the reproduction address Ap detected after the pickup 22 moveS to conform to the reference address Ar as shown by the process Pus5. This state means that the pickup 28 is located on the right track, if the pickup 22 ài1e to trace the prescribed track causal by any trouble, for instance, signal dropouts due to dusts or damaged parts on the disc 26 or a foreign mechanical force for the pickup 28. However, the processes Ps4 and Ps, are carried out as if they were going round the process Ps3 at high speed, while the pickup carriage motcr 48 is operated on a real time basis to make the reproduction address Ap always conform to the reference address Ar. There is now described another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the microprocessor 22 is programmed to generate the kick pulse SPa or KPb with a prescribed unit length s pulse width when the address comparator 54 detects the difference between the reproduction address Ap and the reference address Ar, in spite of the value of the difference. While the the pulse width of the kick pulse SPa orKPb is set so as the pickup 28 to move by one track when the kick pulse KPa or KPb is applied to the pickup 28. In this arrangement, the pickup 28 is moved one track step by step by checking the difference between the reproduction address Ap and the reference address Ar in every step until the reproduction address Ap conforms to the reference address Ar. There is now described a further embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the microprocessor 22 is programmed to generate the kick pulse KPa or KPb with the yreserited unit length a pulse width both in the faet forward or the fast reverse operation and the playback operation.Therefore, the output control circuit 50 can be eliminated. Accordingly, the apparatus shown in Fig. 2 will operate to reproduce the reproduction address Ap recorded with the digital data at the program area of the disc 26 in conformity with the reference address Ar even if there occurs track interlacing due to dust and scratches on the disc 26 and this makes possible the always stable playback operation of the usdisc reproducing apparatus. Moreover, by raising the accuracy of the reference address generator 52 up to the order of the AFRAME portion of the address absolute time , the limit of the detection of track interlacing can be more improved and this is advantgageous. By making the frequency of the oscillator of the reference address generator 52 variable, the tracing speed of the pickup 2B or the reproduction speed of the disc can readily be controlled and furthermore a controller for special use in fast forwarding and fast reversing can also be omitted. In other words, each of the playback, fast forward and fast reverse operations can be realized with the roughly same arrangement by changing the intervals at which the reference address Ar of the reference address generator 52. In addition, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific e hndimpnts t.h rpnf anA that vnrioiiii changes in the shape and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit of the invention. As above described, the present invention makes it possible to provide a superior disc record reproducing apparatus capable of reproducing digital data recorded on a disc having dust and scratches, for instance, stably without causing track interlacing.
