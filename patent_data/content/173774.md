# Gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
A high efficiency, compact gas turbine engine of medium power output comprises at least two compressor stages including one front centrifugal compressor stage 34 all mounted on a common shaft 28 for compressing inlet air 24 , a combustion chamber 64 for burning fuel in mixture with the compressed air to provide hot gases 56 , output power generating means 78 operated responsive to the hot gases, an axial compressor turbine 44 driven by the hot gases exiting from the combustion chamber for driving the compressor stages including an axial compressor stage 42 integral with the axial compressor turbine 44 , and a heat exchanger 68 intercalated between this integral compressor compressor turbine 42, 44 and the output power generating means 78 . Cool air in the compressor stage 42 serves to cool the integral compressor turbine 44 blades, and subsequently reaches the combustion means 64 . The position of the heat exchanger gives greater thermodynamic efficiency, and the whole configuration gives greater compactness, than hitherto.
