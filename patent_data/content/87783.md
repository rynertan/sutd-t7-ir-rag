# Method and apparatus for winding strands of glass fibers.

## Abstract
An apparatus for winding strands 2b of glass fiber filaments 2 is disclosed. The apparatus comprises at least one primary winding means e.g. a takeup collet 6 on which a strand 2b of glass fiber filaments is wound, a guiding mechanism 15 for guiding and end portion of the strand which has started being drawn off from a spinning bushing 1 to a predetermined position below the spinning bushing preferably on a stream of fluid e.g. water, and an auxiliary winder mechanism 7, 8 rotatable for catching and winding the guided end portion of the strand. The auxiliary winder 7, 8 is moved toward said takeup collet 6 when the end portion of the strand is under a condition capable of being transferred onto the takeup collet 6 for bringing the strand into contact with the takeup collet within a winding zone thereof. An associated method therefor is also disclosed.
