## Description
Pharmaceutical Formulations, Heterocyclic Compounds, the Preparation of the Formulations and Compounds and their Use in Medicine This invention relates to topical formulations comprising heterocyclic compounds, their preparation, to their use in medicine in a mammal, including man, as anti inflammatories, and to certain novel heterocyclic compounds which exhibit a particularly useful pharmacological profile. The heterocyclic compounds referred to herein are of formula 1 EMI1.1 wherein, Ar is selected from pyridyl or phenyl, each of which may be optionally substituted in one or two positions in the ring by the same or a different substituent, said substituent being selected from trifluoromethyf, fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo R1 is selected from hydrogen and acyl having from 1 to 4 carbons atoms and R4 and R5 are the same or different and each is selected from hydrogen and alkyl having frnm 1 to 4 carbon atoms and acid addition salts thereof. The heterocyclic compounds of formula I are members of a class of compounds encompassed within UK patent specification No. 1 324 687 and alleged to have anti spasmodic activity. Certain of the heterocyclic compounds of formula I are known as chemical intermediates in UK patent specification Nos. 1 515 500, 679678 and 679677. In Biochem. Pharmacol. 1979 , 28, 1959 1961 it is disclosed that one such heterocyclic compound of formula 1 , namely 3 amino l m trifluoromethylphenyl pyrazol 2 ine, has been shown to have anti inflammatory activity in the rat when administered orally in the carrageenin induced oedema assay.Related I alkyl 3 amino 5 arylpyrazol 2 ines are disclosed in UK patent specification No. 1 294 03S as having anti inflammatory, analgesic or antipyretic activity. It has now been found that the heterocyclic compounds of formula I exhibit a potent anti inflammatory action in mammals when administered topically and that such activity can be achieved at doses which do not provide the side effects associated either with their systemic e.g. oral administration or the administration of certain other topical anti inflammatories.In comparison comparison with the compounds disclosed in UK Patent No. 1 294 035, the heterocyclic compounds of formula I exhibit more potent anti inflammatory activity and some heterocyclic compounds of formula I are more selective in inhibiting the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism than 3 amino 1 m trifluoromethylphenyl pyrazol 2 ine. The antiinflammatory activity of the heterocyclic compounds of formula I on topical administration is surprising in view of the teaching of the antispasmodic activity claimed for them in UK Patent No. 1 324 687.None of the antispasmodic agents described in The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 5th Edition, by Goodman and Gilman, pages 514 to 532 Macmillan, 1975 have anti inflammatory activity. It is even more suprising since it has been found that the heterocyclic compounds referred to herein have aspirin like i.e. peripheral not central analgesic activity. Preferred heterocyclic compounds of formula I are those wherein, Ar is selected from 3 substituted phenyl, 4 substituted phenyl3,4 disubstituted phenyl and 5 substituted pyridyl R1 is selected from hydrogen and acetyl and and RS are the same or different and each is selected from hydrogen and methyl. Where Ar is substituted phenyl, it is preferred that Ar is 3 or 4 trifluoroniethylphenyl or plienyl substituted by one or more of fluoro, chloro or bromo in the 3 , 4 or 3,4 positions. More preferred heterocyclic compounds of formula I are those wherein Ar is selected from phenyl substituted by one or two substituent s selected from 4 fluoro, 4 chloro, 4 bromo and 3 trifluoromethyl, and pyridyl substituted by one substituent selected from 5 chloro, 5 bromo and 5 iodo, such as 3 amino I m trifluoromethylphenyl 2 pyrazoline 3 araino 1 m trifluoromethyl p chlorophenyl 2 pyrazo line 3 amino 1 p fluorophenyl 2 pyrazoline 3 amino l m trifluoromethyl p bromophenyl 2 pyrazoline 3 amino 1 5 chloro 2 pyridyl 2 py razoline 3 amino 1 5 bromo 2 pyridyl 2 pyrazoline 3 amino I 5 iodo 2 pyridyl 2 pyrazoline and 3 N acetylamino l rn trifluoromeshylphenyl 2 pyrazo√≠ine. Particularly preferred are the heterocyclic compounds of formula I wherein R and R are each hydrogen such as 3 amino 1 m trifluoromethylphenyl 2 pyrazoline 3 amino 1 m trifluoromethyl p chlorophenyl 2 pyrazoline and 3 amino l p fluorophenyl 2 pyrazoline Especially preferred heterocyclic compounds of formula I are those wherein, one of R4 and R5 is methyl, such as 3 amino 1 p fluorophenyl 4 methyl 2 pyrazoline and 3 amino 1 p fluorophenyl 5 methyl 2 pyrazoline. When used in medicine, the acid addition salts of a heterocyclic compound of formula I should be both pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, but non acceptable salts may be conveniently used to prepare the bases of such acceptable salts and are not excluded from the scope of this invention. Acceptable salts may be derived from organic acids, particularly dicarboxylic acids.Such pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those prepared from the following acids hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phos phoric, oxalic, fumaric, maleic, glycolic, salicyclic, succinic , toluene p sulphonic, tartaric, acetic, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene2 sulphonic and benzene sulphonic. The heterocyclic compounds of formula I may be prepared by any method known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure. Suitable methods of preparing the compounds of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen include reacting a compound of formula 11 Ar NH.NH2 Il with an acrylonitrile of formula Ill R5 CH C R4 .CN Ill wherein Ar, R4 and R5 are as defined in formula I hereinabove. The reaction may be carried out by standard techniques knovvn in the art, conveniently in a polar solvent such as alkanol for example ethanol, in the presence of a base such as sodium in ethanol or sodium hydroxide, with or without heating or cooling and optionally in a nitrogen atmosphere. Suitable methods of preparing the compounds of formula I whereinR1 is acyl as defined hereinabove include acylating a compound of formula I whereinR1 is hydrogen and Ar, R4 and R5 are as defined in formula 1 hereinbefore. The acylation may be effected by standard methods which include reaction with the appropriate acid anhydride for example acetic anhydride, acid halide for example acetyl chloride, or mixed anhydride such as acetic anhydride in formic acid. The reaction may be effected in an unreactive solvent such as chloroform and at an elevated temperature 60 80 where necessary or without a solvent when lower temperatures are preferable.Acylation may also be effected by reaction with butyl lithium followed by reaction with the appropriate carboxylic acid ester, for example ethyl butyrate. Alternatively, the heterocyclic compounds of formula 1 wherein Ar is phenyl or substituted phenyl may be prepared according to the method of G.F.Duffin and J.D. Kendall in 3. Chem. Soc. 1954 , 411 412. For example by reduction of a compound of formula it EMI6.1 wherein one of X or Y is N NAr and when X is N NAr, Y is hydrogen and when Y is N NAr, X is NHR1 and Ar, R4, R5 and 1 1 are as defined, with a reducing agent such as zinc and a carboxylic acid such as acetic acid or stannous chloride and a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid in a unreactive polar solvent such as an alkanol, for example, ethanol. Alternatively, the heterocyclic compounds of formula 1 may be prepared according to the methods described in UK patent specification No. 1 324 687 such as mild hydrolysis of a 1,2,4 oxadiazole of formula V with, for example, sodium ethylate EMI6.2 wherein Ar, R4 and R5 are as defined in formula I to produce a compound of formula I wherein R1 is acyl.Further hydrolysis using, for example, sodium hydroxide would produce the compound wherein R1 is hydrogen. Or they may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VI EMI7.1 with a reagent such as toluenesulphonyl chloride in a solvent such as pyridine.The heterocyclic compound of formula I prepared by any of these methods may be optionally interconverted to any other desired compound of formula I . For example, a compound of formula I wherein R1 is acyl may be converted to the corresponding compound whereinR1 is hydrogen or vice versa.The heterocyclic compounds of formula I may be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of inflammation in a mammal, including man, and may be administered topically in the relief of rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, ostearthritis, gouty arthritis, adjuvant arthritis and other arthritic conditions, inflamed joints, eczema, psoriasis or other inflammatory skin conditions such as sunburn inflammatory eye conditions including conjunctivitis pyresis, pain and other conditions associated with inflammation.By topical administration is meant non systemic administration and includes the application of a heterocyclic compound of formula I externally to the epidermis, to the buccal cavity and instillation of such a compound into the ear, eye and nose, and where the compound does not significantly enter the blood stream. By systemic administration is meant oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration. The amount required of a compound of formula I hereinafter referred to as the active ingredient for therapeutic effect will, of course, vary with the compound chosen, the nature and severity of the inflammatory condition and the mammal undergoing treatment and is ultimately at the discretion of the physician.A suitable anti inflammatory dose of an active ingredient is 1 ng to 500 mg of base per kilogram bodyweight, the most preferred dosage being 10 ng to 5 mg kg of mammal bodyweight, for example 0.1 to 2,ug kg adminstered at four hourly intervals, as required. For application to the skin, from Ijig to several mg of the active ingredient may be applied per application, preferably from 10 to lOOyug per application. While it is possible for an active ingredient to be topically administered alone as the raw chernical, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation. The active ingredient may comprise from 0.001 to 109b by weight of the formulation conveniently, not in excess of 5 w w and preferably from 0.1 to 1 w w of the formulation. The balance of the formulation comprises one or more acceptable carriers therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.The carrier s must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient therefor. Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semiliquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of inflammation such as liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear or nose. Drops according to the present invention may comprise sterile a eOtlS or oily soiutions or suspensions and may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a suitable aqueous solution of a bactericidal and or fungicidal agent and or any other suitable preservative, and preferably including a surface active agent. The resulting solution may then be clarified by filtration, transferred to a suitable container which is then sealed and sterilised by autoclaving or maintaining at 98 1000C for half an hour. Alternatively, the solution may be sterilised by filtration and transferred to the container by an aseptic technique. Examples of bactericidal and fungicidal agents suitable for inclusion in the drops are phenylmercuric nitrate or acetate 0.002 , benzalkonium chloride 0.01 and chlorhexidine acetate 0.01 .Suitable solvents for the preparation of an oily solution include glycerol, diluted alcohol and prnpylene glycol. Lotions according to the present invention include those suitable for application to the skin or eye. An eye lotion may comprise a sterile aqueous solution optionally containing a bactericide and may be prepared by methods similar to those for the preparation of drops. Lotions or liniments for application to the skin may also include an agent to hasten drying and to cool the skin, such as an alcohol or acetone, and or a moisturiser such as glycerol or an oil such as castor oil or arachis oil. Creams, ointments or pastes according to the present invention are semisolid formulations of the active ingredient for external application. They may be made by mixing the active ingredient in finely divided or powdered form alone or in solution or suspension in an aqueous or non aqueous fluid, with the aid of suitable machinery, with a greasy or non greasy basis. The basis may comprise hydrocarbons such as hard, soft or liquid paraffin, glycerol, beeswax, a metallic soap a mucilage, an oil of natural origin such as almond, corn, arachis, castor or olive oil, wool fat or its derivatives, or a fatty acid such as stearic or oleic acid together with an alcohol such as propylene glycol or macrogols. The formulation may incorporate any suitable surface active agent such as an anionic, cationic or non ionic surfactant such as sorbitan esters or polyoxyethylene derivatives thereof.Suspending agents such as natural gums, cellulose derivatives or inorganic materials such as silicaceous silicas and other ingredients such as Janolin may also be included.According to the present invention there are therefore provided a a novel heterocyclic compounds of formula I and acid addition salts thereof b a method of preparing the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore described c pharmaceutical formulations suitable for topical administration, comprising a non toxic, effective anti inflammatory amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor d a method for preparing such formulations e a heterocyclic compound of formula I as an active agent for use in the treatment or prophy laxis of inflammation in a mammal f a heterocyclic compound of formula I whenever administered topically to a mammal in need thereof g a method for the prophylaxis or treatment of in flammation in a mammal, including man, comprising the topical administration to said mammal of a non toxic, effective, anti inflammatory amount of a compound of formula I .The following Examples are provided by way of an illustration of the present invention and should in no way be construed as a limitation thereof.
