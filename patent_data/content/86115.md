# Process and apparatus for the continuous electrolytic treatment of a metal strip using horizontal electrodes.

## Abstract
Electrolytic treatment of a metal strip with an electrolytic treating liquid carried out using an apparatus comprising a device for feeding the metal strip a device for delivering the metal strip, which device is arranged downstream the feeding device in such a manner that a horizontal path of movement of the steel strip is provided between the feeding and delivering devices a pair of electrode devices spaced from and facing each other through the horizontal path of the metal strip and each extending in parallel to the horizontal path, each electrode device having an electrode and static pressure liquid pad located in the electrode, each static pressure liquid pad being provided with a slit nozzle for ejecting an electrolytic treating liquid toward the correspond ing metal strip surface under conditions adequate for producing a static pressure of the electrolytic treating liquid ejected therethrough between each electrode device and the corresponding metal strip surface to an extent that the metal strip is supported in the horizontal path thereof a source for supplying the electrolytic treating liquid to each slit nozzle, and a device for applying voltage between the electrodes and metal strip. The apparatus is characterized in that an additional slit nozzle is arranged at each of the entrance ends and the exit ends of the pair of electrode devices, each additional slit nozzle being directed to the corresponding metal strip surface and being connected to said electrolyte supplying source, whereby streams of the electrolytic treat ing liquid ejected through the slit nozzles are confirmed in the spaces between the electrode devices and the metal strip by the streams of the electrolytic treating liquid ejected through the additional slit nozzles.
