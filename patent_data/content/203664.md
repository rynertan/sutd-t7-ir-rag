A printer having a guide for an insertable cassette, in which is provided a receipt strip displaceable with respect to a printing head, the cassette being pro vided with at least one window for the entry into the cas sette of transport means for said strip, characterized in that a lock releasable by an initial translation of the cassette in the printer releases a cylindrical transport roller which is pivotable about a fixed shaft and, after a further translation of the cassette performs a pivotal movement into a window of the cassette at a first side of the cassette and consequently comes into pressure contact with the printing head at a second side of the cassette located opposite the first side, the receipt strip being clamped during printing between the transport roller and the printing head.

## Description
The invention relates to a printer having a guide for an insertable cassette, in which is provided a receipt strip displaceable with respect to a printing head, the cassette being provided with at least one window for the entry into the cassette of transport means for said strip. In a printer of the above kind arranged in a video camera cf. US PS 4,161,749 , the cassette is provided with a curved guide for the receipt strip and a colour transfer strip projecting from a supply part. This guide follows the periphery of a transport roller for the receipt strip arranged outside the cassette and extends as far as the area at which the printing head is situated. Before a leaf shaped receipt strip can be printed, the two strips have to be introduced into the curved guide by means of the manuallyoperated transport means passed into entry windows of the cassette. Subsequently, the transport of the data strip is taken over by the said transport roller. During printing, the colour transfer strip is situated in a fixed position with respect to the printing head and the trans port roller. The known printer for a video camera is a colour printer having a receipt strip and a colour transfer strip on which the different base colours are present. A disadvantage of the known colour printer is that various transport means are necessary for carrying the colour transfer strip and the data strip outside the cassette for preparing the printing and the transport of the data strip during printing. Furthermore, there is a risk that during transport from the cassette to the curved guide not one but several data strips are carried along. The invention has for its object to provide a colour printer suitable both for black and white and colour printing, in which the above disadvantages are avoided and by which the transport of the data strip or of the data strip and the colour transfer strip is mechanized to a comparatively large extent. The invention is for this purpose characterized in that a lock releasable by an initial translation of the cassette in the printer releases a cylindrical transport roller which is pivotable about a fixed shaft and, after a further translation of the cassette, performs a pivotal movement into a window of the casssette at a first side of the cassette and consequently comes into pressure contact with the printing head at a second side of the cassette lo cated opposite the first side, the data strip being clamped during printing between the transport roller and the prin ting head. It should be noted that European Patent Applica tion 0086661 discloses a colour printer in which both the transport of the colour transfer strip and that of the data strip take place automatically. The transport mecha nism for the strips are completely separate here, however also the transport does not take place in a cassette in which both a colour transfer strip and a data strip can be transported. This not only leads to the need for addi tional transport means but also results in the step of introducing the strip being comparatively laborious and having to be effected with an opened colour printer. British Patent Application 2100673 discloses a colour printer in which the transport of the colour trans fer strip is also fully completely separate from the trans port of the data strip. The transport of the colour trans fer strip takes place in the cassette, whereas the trans port of the data strip takes place entirely outside the cassette. In this case also, additional transport means are therefore required. A particular embodiment of the printer, according to the invention, in which a single electric motor is used for driving a data strip and a transfer strip arranged in the cassette, is further characterized in that the cassette is provided with a data strip and a transfer strip which, when the transport roller is pivoted, are both clamped be tween the transport roller and the printing head, andin that an electric motor arranged in the printer is coupled A further embodiment of the printer, in which the transfer strip can be transported at an invariably con stant speed, is characterized in that a gear wheel forming part of the first gear wheel train is coupled by means of a frictional coupling to a gear wheel forming part of the se cond gear wheel train. A still further embodiment of the printer, in which both the position of the cassette with respect to the printing head is defined and a suitable pressure force of the printing head against the data carrier is profuced by means of a function disk, is further characterized in that the printer is provided with a rotatable function disk having first and second cam grooves, the first cam groove being engaged by a first follower pin which is coupled to a first lever system for pivoting a pair of pressure rollers against the transport roller and for positioning the cassette with respect to the printing head, and the second cam groove being engaged by a second follower pin which is coupled to a se cond lever system for pivoting a pressure plate into press ing engagement with the printing head. Another embodiment of the printer, in which the possibility of the symbols to be printed being smeared is comparatively small, is characterized in that the first and second gear wheel trains are coupled by means of a stepping mechanism to the electric motor. A preferred embodiment of the printer having a comparatively simple and reliable drive for stepwise trans port of the data strip and the data strip and the colour transfer strip, respectively, is further characterized in that the stepping mechanism comprises a first gear wheel which can be continuously rotated by the electric motor and a stepwise rotatable second gear wheel, while the con tinuously rotatable first gear wheel can be coupled by means of a unidirectional coupling to, and can be disengaged from, a cam disk which is engaged by a cam follower secured to the printing head, the stepwise rotatable second gear wheel meshing with a gear wheel which forms part of both the first and the second gear wheel train. A preferred embodiment of a cassette for a printer according to the invention in which a single electric motor is used for driving the transport roller arranged in the printer and for transporting a transfer strip arranged in the cassette, is characterized in that the cassette has a supply reel for a transfer strip rotatable about a first shaft and a take up reel for the transferstrip rotatable about a second shaft parallel to the first shaft, the take up reel being provided with a driving member which can be coupled to an external motor drive arranged in the printer. A further embodiment of the cassette, in which the transfer strip is permanently kept under tensile stress in a simple manner, is characterized in that the first shaft is provided with a frictional coupling, which during printing, when the first shaft and the second shaft are rotated in a direction corresponding to the transport direction of the data strip or transfer strip, exerts a continuous frictional force on the first shaft and after printing, when the second shaft is stationary, causes the first shaft to be rotated briefly in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of thefirst shaft during printing. A still further embodiment of a cassette having a frictional coupling which is comparatively inexpensive in mass production, is characterized in that the frictional coupling comprises a helical spring which surrounds the first shaft and has a first end bearing on a wall in the cassette and a free second end, a first part of the helical spring engaging on its inner side a part of the first shaft having a comparatively large diameter, whi le a second part of the helical spring is arranged so as to be free from a part of the first shaft having a comparatively small dia meter. A still further embodiment of the cassette, in which the data strip is protected against undesired trans port when the cassette is removed from the printer, is characterized in that the cassette is provided with a brake for the data strip, which brake is inoperative during prin ting and is operative before and after printing to exert a braking force on the data strip. The invention will be described more fully with reference to the drawings, in which The preferred embodiment of a printer 1 shown in Fig. 1 is a colour printer having a data strip and a colour transfer strip with different body colours yellow, magenta, cyan in successive fields. The printer comprises a housing with a bottom 3 and two parallel side walls 5 and 7 arranged at right angles to the bottom 3. For strengthening the housing, the side walls 5 and 7 are interconnected by a con nection bar 9 of L shaped cross section and a connection plate 11. To the side walls 5 and 7 are secured parallel horizontal rails 13, 15 and 16, respectively see Figs. 4 and 7 for guiding a cassette 17. The plate shaped cassette 17 can be fully inserted into the housing of the colour printer 1 along the rails 13, 15 and 16. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the printer 1 is provided with a printing head 19 which is movable in a reciprocatory manner in a horizontal plane a direction at right angles to the direction of in sertion of the cassette 17. The plate shaped printing head 19 has on its lower side a row of known thermal printing elements 20 shown in the side elevation of Fig. 2 , which have to be brought into pressure contact with the colour transfer strip and the data carrier, which will be explained more fully hereinafter. On the connection bar 9 are formed two L shaped lugs 21 and 23, whose upright walls 25 and 27, lying in a vertical plane, form guides for two loose disk shaped rollers 29 and 31. The printing head 19 is provided with two substantially rectangular windows 33 and 35 having edges 37 and 39 which also form guides for the rollers 29 and 31. By means of a tension spring 41, which is hooked at one end into the connection bar 9 and at its other end into a lug 43 on the printing head 19, the rollers 29 and 31 are kept pressed against the wall 25 and the edge 37 and against the wall 27 and the edge 39, respectively. A third roller 47 is secured on a shaft 45 journalled in two lugs 49 and 51 which are formed on the printing head 19 cf. Fig. 2 . The third roller 47 is guided during printing on the horizontal surface of the L shaped connection bar 9. On a laterally projecting portion 53 of the printing head 19 are journalled two rotatable rollers 55 and 57, which serve as cam followers. The cam followers 55 and 57 roll on a rota table cam disk 59, which is driven by means of a D.C. motor 61 As shown in Fig. 5, the printer is provided with a cylindrical transport roller 65 comprising a rubber sleeve 67 freely rotatable about a core 66. The longitudinal axis of the transport roller 65 lies in a horizontal plane and extends in a direction at right angles to the direction of transport of the cassette 17. By means of stub shafts 69 and 71, which form part of the core 66, and bearings 73 and 75, the transport roller 65 is rotatably supported in levers 77 and 79. The lever 77 is rotatable about a shaft 81, which is secured in the side wall 5, while the lever 79 is rotatable about a shaft 83 which is secured in a frame plate 85. The shaft 83 fits in a bore 87 in a com paratively thick shaft 89, on one end of which are teeth forming a gear wheel 91 and on the other end of which is fixed a gear wheel 93. The shaft 89 is journalled in the side wall 7 and can also rotate about the shaft 83. The gear wheel 91 meshes with a gear wheel 95, which is rota table about a shaft 97 secured in the lever 79 and is in tegral with a further gear wheel 99 which is also rota table about the shaft 97. A gear wheel 103, which meshes with the gear wheel 99, is rotatable about a shaft 101 secured in the lever 79. A gear wheel 105 is integral with the gear wheel 103 and rotates wtith it about the shaft 101. The gear wheel 105 meshes with a gear wheel 107 fixedly secured on the stub shaft 71. A gear wheel 109 is also ro tatable about the shaft 97 and this gear wheel is driven by the gear wheel 95 On the output shaft of the motor 61 is fixed a pinion 113 see Figs. 3 and 4 which meshes with the gear wheel 63 see Figs. 1, 5 and 6 . As shown in Fig. 5, the gear wheel 63 is provided with a pin 115, by means of which a star wheel 117 of a Geneva mechanism is driven in a step wise manner. On the star wheel 117 is secured a gear wheel 119, which rotates with the star wheel 117 in a stepwise manner about a shaft 121 mounted in the sidewall 7. The gear wheel 63 is further coupled by a freewheel coupling to the cam disk 59. The gear wheel 119 meshes with the gear wheel 93. The freewheel coupling shown diagrammatically in Fig. 8 comprises a first coupling half 123 integral with the gear wheel 63 and a second coupling half 127 which is ro tatable about a shaft 125 secured in the side wall 7 and is integral with the cam disk 59. The freewheel coupling fur ther comprises a wire spring 129 having a first orthogonally bent end 131 which fits in a hole 133 in the first coupling half 123 and a second orthogonally bent end 135 which ex tends through two slots 137 only one slot 137 is shown in Fig. 8 which are formed in lugs 139 and 141. The lugs 139 and 141 project from the first coupling half 123 at right angles to the plane thereof and bound a gap into which extends an arcuate ridge 143 with a ramp surface formed on the second coupling half 127. Upon rotation of the first coupling half 123 in the freewheel direction, the end 135 of the spring 129 follows the ramp surface of the ridge 143 from a given instant. The spring 129 is deflected as the end 135 is simultaneously displaced in the slots 137. Upon further rotation of the first coupling half 123, the end 135 of the spring 129 springs down behind a shoulder 145 at the end of the ridge 143 and the spring is relieved. When the direction of rotation of the first coupling half 123 is then reversed reverse direction ,the end 135 of the spring 129 will engage the shoulder 145 and rotate the second coupling half 127 and hence the cam disk 59 in the reverse direction. The cam disk 59 is provided with a cam track 147, which can be defined mathematically with a poly nomial of the fifth order. The rollers 55 and 57 see Fig. 2 follow the cam track 147 so that a reciprocatory trans lational movement is imparted to the printing head 19. The transport roller 65 has two extreme positions, namely, a first extreme position in which the cassette 17 is removed and a second extreme position in which the cassette 17 is inserted. In the first extreme position, the transport roller 65 is locked in a position in which it lies below the guiding level of the rails 13 and 15, as shown in Figs. 1, 3 and 14. The transport roller 65 is locked by means of a lock which is releasable by an initial trans lation of the cassette 17 along the rails 13 and 15, which lock comprises two levers 153 and 155 rotatable about shafts 149 and 151, respectively see also Figs. 4, 6, 7 . The shaft 149 is journalled in the side wall 5 Figs. 1, 6 and 7 , while the shaft 151 is journalled in a lug 157 which is stamped out of the bottom 3 see Figs. 3 and 4 . The levers 153 and 155 are loaded by wire springs 159 and 161 wound around the shafts 149 Fig. 1 and 151 Fig. 4 , respective ly. For this purpose, the ends of the springs 159 and 161 are hooked on the one hand into the side wall 5 and the lug 157 and on the other hand into the levers 153 and 155 not shown , respectively. The loading direction of the springs is such that in the first extreme position of the levers 153 and 155, lugs 163 and 165 formed on the levers 153 and 155 are pressed against the levers 77 and 79. Only the lug 163 of the levers 153 is shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 14. The levers 77 and 79 carrying the transport roller 65 are spring loaded in a manner not shown similar to the levers 153 and 155. In this case, the loading the res pective wire springs is directed so that, after being re leased by the cassette 17, the transport roller 65 is pivoted upwards with the levers 77 and 79. It should be noted that the moments of the spring loading on the levers 153 and 155 at the area of engagement with the levers 77 and 79 must be larger than the spring loading moments on the levers 77 and 79 in the case in which the pressure points are located above or below the shafts 81 and 83. In the embodiment described, these pressure points are at the same vertical level as the shafts 81 and 83 so that the ratio of the spring loading forces is not critical. As can be seen from Figs. 3 and 14, the levers 153 and 155 are pressed backwards against their spring loading by the front side of the cassette during initial translation of the cas sette 17 along the rails 13 and 15 in the printer, so that the locking of the levers 77 and 79 is released. The levers 77 and 79 are now pivoted under spring force to raise the transport rollers 65. The cassette 17 is provided with a funnel shaped window 167, which, when the translation of the cassette continues, lies just above the transport roller 65 when the latter reaches the level of the rails 13 and 15. The levers 77 and 79 are now automatically pivoted into the position shown in Fig. 15, in which the transport roller 65 projects just above the cassette 17. In this position, a gear wheel 169, which meshes with the gear wheel 109, comes into mesh with a gear wheel 171 in the cassette 17 which is coupled to a take up roller 191 for the colour transfer strip. The gear wheel 171 is shown in Figs. 9, 11, 14, 15 and 16, while the gear wheel 169 is shown only in Fig. 15. The gear wheel 169 is rotatably journalled on the lever 79. In the present case, thecassette 17 is provided with a data strip 175 normal paper and a colour transfer strip 177. The colour transfer strip 177 is of a usual kind comprising three fields of wax of different body colours, The transport roller 65 is now locked against displacement parallel to the direction of insertion of the cassette in the extreme position occupied during printing by means of a first driven lever system. This first lever system comprises As shown in Figs. 1 and 6, the function disk 235 is further provided with a second cam groove 245 in which one end of a second follower pin 247 is guided. The second follower pin 247 forms part of a second lever system comprising a lever 249 which is rotatable about the shaft 193. A pressure plate 251 which is located above the prin ting head 19 and in which a pressure roller 253 is jour nalled has a laterally extending portion 255 and a downward ly extending portion 257. The pressure plate 251 is rota table about the shaft 193 and is locked against displacement in a direction parallel to the direction of insertion of the cassette 17 by means of two wire springs 263 and 265 supported by the shaft 193 and by lugs 259 and 261. The down wardly extending portion 257 of the pressure plate is pro vided with three stamped out lugs 267, 269 and 271, between which is mounted a leaf spring 273. A tapering end 275 of the leaf spring 273 resiliently engages the follower pin 247. When the function disk 235 is rotated, the point of engagement between the follower pin 247 and the leaf spring 273 is displaced, as a result of which the pressure plate 251 performs a pivotal movement directed towards the prin ting head 19. The pressure roller 253 then engages the printing head 19 with the force required for printing. The printing head 19 is therefore pressed with the desired force against the colour transfer strip 177 surrounding the trans port roller 65. Both when the cassette 17 is located outside the printer 1 and when the cassette is inserted into the printer, the colour transfer strip 177 is kept taut by means of a frictional coupling. For this purpose, in a manner not shown, a short shaft 279 is secured to a shaft 277 of the supply reel 189 see Fig. 11 by means of a pin system. The shaft 279 has a part 291 of comparatively large diameter and a part 283 of comparatively small diameter. The shaft 279 is surrounded by a helical spring 285 having a diameter which is constant throughout the length of the spring in the relaxed state. The helical spring 285 is mounted in the relaxed state with a loose sliding fit on the comparatively thick part 281 of the shaft 279 and is arranged so as to be free from the comparatively thin part 283. When during printing a pulling force is exerted by the transport roller 65 on the colour transfer strip 177, a part 287 of the spring 285 is effectively wound onto the part 281 of the shaft 279 and thereby tightened on this part of the shaft, as a result of which a light gripping action the part 287 of the spring 285 on the part 281 of the shaft 279 is ob tained. The diameter of the part 287 of the spring 285 is consequently slightly reduced, while the diameter of a part 289 of the spring 285 which freely surrounds the part 283 of the shaft 279 remains constant. During this tightening of the part 287 of the spring 285, one end 291 thereof engages a wall 293 of the cassette 17. The other end 295 of the spring 285 remains free. When the part 287 of the spring 285 is tightened, the latter exerts a frictional force on the part 281 of the shaft 279 so that a constant braking force is exerted on the supply reel 189 and the colour transfer strip 177 is kept taut. When the rotation of the transport roller 65 is then stopped and the cassette 17 is removed from the printer 1, the reviling force in the spring 285 is sufficient to tauten the bulge produced by the transport roller 65 in the colour transfer strip 177. The take up reel 191 is locked against backward rotation by a leaf spring pawl 297 arrangedin the cassette 17 see Figs. 14 and 15 , which pawl is in engagement with the teeth of a ratchet wheel 303 fixed on a shaft 301 of thetake up reel 191. The spring 285 is locked against displacement along the shaft 279 by a locking chip 305 which is located in a groove 307 in the shaft 279. In the lower half 179 of the cassette 17, near either side thereof, is a chamber 309, 311 respectively, in which a brake is provided for the data strip 175, which is wider than the colour transfer strip 177 see Figs. 11, 12 and 13 . The operation of the brake in the chamber 309 is described with reference to Fig. 18. The brake in the chamber 311 is identical to that in the chamber 309. The chamber 309 accommodates a slide 313 which is displaceable against the force of a spring 315, which, when the cassette is removed from the printer, is unloaded. The slide 313 is guided along the walls of the chamber 309. The slide 313 has secured to it a rubber coated pin 317 which is guided along a slope 319 on the edge of a partition wall 321 in the cassette 17. The forks 199 and 201 at the ends of the levers 195 and 197 are constructed so that the rear side of the respective fork presses, after a pivotal movement of the levers 195 and 197, against the slide 313 in the direction of an arrow 329 in Fig. 18. The pin 317 then occupies its lowermost position on the slope319 so that the data strip 175 is free from the pin 317 during printing. When the cassette 17 is removed from the printer 1, the spring 315 is relieved so that the pin 317 will occupy its uppermost position on the slope 319. In the latter position the pin 317 presses the data strip 175 against the lower side of the upper half 181 of the cassette 17 and thereby acts as a brake. The data strip 175 is thus prevented from being unintentionally displaced by the exertion of a pulling force on the part of the strip projecting from the cassette 17. A part of the data strip 175 in fact always projects from the cassette 17 through the cassette window 167. Due to the braking force on the data strip 175, this strip can also be torn off in a simple manner. It should be noted that the forks 199 and 201 have a threefold function, namely positioning the cassette 17 with respect to the printing head 19, positioning the transport roller 65 with respect to the printing head 19, releasing the brake on the data strip 175. The operation of the printer 1 will now be des cribed, it being assumed that the cassette 17 has been inserted and is positioned by the forks 199 and 201 and that the pressure plate 251 is keeping the rpinting head 19 pressed against the data strip 175 and colour transfer strip 177 arranged around the transport roller 65. As shown in Fig. 7, the function disk 235 is provided with a third cam groove 325, which forms a guide for a third follower pin 327 which is secured to a lever 330 which is journalled in the side wall 7 for rotation about a shaft 329. The cam groove 325 is formed in the side of the function disk 235 facing the side wall 7. The lever 330 has secured to it an ejector pin 331 which is guided in a slot 333 in the side wall 7. When the cassette 17 is inserted, the ejector pin331 engages the front side of the cassette not shown in the Figures . Consequently, when the function disk 235 is rotated, the cassette 17 can be moved over a given length out of the printer by means of the lever 330 through the ejector pin 331. The cassette can then be removed by hand. To the side wall 7 of the printer are secured two micro switches 335 and 337, actuating fingers 339 and 341 of which engage a cam 343 on the function disc 235. The switches 335 and 337 serve to limit the rotations of the function disk 235 in both directions of rotation. Whilst maintaining the principle of a pivotable transport roller for the tansport of the data strip des cribed hereinbefore with referenc eto a particular embodi ment of the printer, a number of alternatives are possible. In fact, the printer and cassette described are mult propose. This means that the printer and the cassette are suitable both for black and white printing and for colour printing. In the case of black and white printing, there are two possibilities, namely printing with a combination of a data strip and a transfer strip only comprising the colour black, printing solely with a data strip. In both cases, it is no longer necessary to transport the data strip back. If only a data strip is used, the cassette of course contains only a data strip. The latter may consist of heat sensitive paper if the printing head 19 comprises thermal printing elements 20, as in the present case. However, the printing head 19 may be of a quite different type. For example, suitable printing heads are electrostatic printing heads,printing heads with im pact elements, such as printing pins, printing heads opera ting with ink drop generators, magnetic printing heads and optical printing heads operating with a photosensitive layer on the data strip. Such printing heads and the data strips used therewith are known Although the printer has been described with reference to a printing principle whereby the dots of dif ferent body colours are printed over each other, other configurations of the dots in different body colours may also be chosen. The dots may be printed both in a triangular configuration and in a line configuration. Such configura tions are known
