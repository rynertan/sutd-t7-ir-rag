# Optical information storage based on polymeric dyes.

## Abstract
An optical recording medium of thermoplastic, radia tion absorbing material comprises at least one polymeric dye which is capable of selective radiation absorption in the wavelength range 300 1000 nm so as to allow thermoplastic deformation of the material by a focused beam of radiation.
