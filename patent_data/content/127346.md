# Peristaltic pumps.

## Abstract
Control apparatus for a stepping motor 1 driving a peris taltic pump comprises a presettable downcounter 15 for supplying drive pulses to the stepping motor 1 at different repetition rates so as to regulate the speed of rotation of the motor, processing means 6 for controlling the downcounter 15 so that the motor is normally operated to drive the pump at a predetermined pumping rate, and a sensor 18 for detect ing indexing marks 19 at spaced positions about the pump head, the processing means 6 being responsive to the sen sor 18 detecting the index marks 19 to alter the count in the downcounter 15 so as to increase the motor speed for a predetermined number of motor steps upon detection of each index mark. After the predetermined number of steps at increased speed, the processing means 6 resets the down counter 15 to its normal setting, so that the motor operates at the required pumping rate for a further predetermined number of motor steps and until detection of the next succes sive index mark 19 of the head. Hence, the drive motor rotates or skips more rapidly during alternate periods corres ponding to dwell periods of the peristaltic pump when reduced or no fluid flow would normally occur and, conse quently, the pump delivers fluid at a more constant flow rate.
