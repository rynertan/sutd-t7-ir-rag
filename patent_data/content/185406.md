# Magnetic head having core parts of an amorphous ferromagnetic metal.

## Abstract
A magnetic head 14 having a core of a magnetizable material around a part of which a coil is provided. A transducing gap 20 is formed between two core parts 17, 18 of a magnetically anisotropic, amorphous ferromagnetic metal. The core parts of a magnetically anisotropic, amor phous ferromagnetic material have a magnetic anisotropy direction 21, 22 induced by a thermal treatment in a magnetic field which is in the plane of the core parts and encloses an angle α with the direction in which magnetic flux traverses the core parts during operation. α preferably is equal to 90 . By these means an increased permeability in the MHz range is reached in combination with a minimum loss component.
