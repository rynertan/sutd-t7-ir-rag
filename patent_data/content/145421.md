# Improvements in or relating to the manufacture of rotary drill bits.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing by a powder metallurgy process a rotary drill bit including a bit body having a plurality of cutting elements mounted on the outer surface thereof comprises the steps of forming a hollow mould 18 for moulding at least a portion of the bid body, packing the mould with powdered matrix material, and infiltrating the material with a metal alloy in a furnace to form a matrix. Before packing the mould with powdered matrix material, there are positioned in spaced locations on the interior surface of the mould a plurality of cutting elements, each of which is formed of a material, such as a polycrystalline diamond material, which is thermally stable at the tem perature necessary to form the matrix. Also positioned in the mould, adjacent the rearward side of each cutting ele ment, is a support material 22 such that, at least after formation of the matrix, the support material has a higher modulus of elasticity than the matrix.
