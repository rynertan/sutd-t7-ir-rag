# Security transfer arrangements.

## Abstract
A security transfer unit includes a hollow box structure 1 that has open ends 10 and 11 on opposite sides of a security barrier 2 and is supported from side frames 4 and 5 with a clearance underneath. A rolling shutter 12 encir cles the box structure 1 to block access at either end 10 and 11 to the chamber 3 through openings 7 and 9 in the unit casing 6 . The shutter 12 is driven to bring an aper ture 19 therein into register with the openings 7 and 9 in turn so that access to the chamber 3 can be gained through only one of them at a time. Drive is in one direction only and is interrupted with the shutter 12 blocking both openings 7 and 9 when the aperture 19 is located in register with an aperture 22 in the box structure 1 , so as to enable viewing of the contents of the transfer chamber 3 through a window 23 above.
