# OPTICAL CONDUCTOR TUBE AND ITS CONNECTING MEMBER

## Abstract
Optical conductor tubes preferable for use in connecting with each other, in order, on the rooftop of a building or the like and for hanging downward, and a connecting member capable of surely or reliably connecting those optical conduc tor tubes with each other. The optical conductor tube is made up of an optical con ductor rod and the protecting tube for protecting it. The pro tecting tube is made thickly and has a threaded portion on its outer circumferential surface at one edge portion thereof, and has another threaded portion on its outer circumferential sur face at another edge portion thereof, and further a groove is formed along the axis of its inner circumferential surface. The connecting member is made up of a sleeve being tightly inserted into the space between the optical conductor rod and the protecting tube and has a projection engaged with the groove on the outer circumferential portion thereof, a nut member engaged with the threaded portion at another edge portion of the protecting tube, and a coupling member having threaded portions on the inner circumferential surfaces of both edge portions thereof which engages with the threaded portions of it at the thickly formed portion of the protecting tubes.
