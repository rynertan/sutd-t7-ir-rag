# Convergence unit for in line colour cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
A convergence unit for an in line colour cathode ray tube consists of 4 E cores 5 located around the neck 1 of the CRT. Each E core, preferably consisting of strip shaped soft magnetic material such as mumetal or permalloy, car ries two coils 7, 8 connected so that the net magnetic field at the central beam 3 is zero. The E cores 5 are arranged in pairs with the resultant fields at the nearer electron beam due to each individual E core being substantially orthogonal to one another.
