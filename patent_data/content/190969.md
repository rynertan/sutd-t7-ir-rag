# Lipid osmotic pump.

## Abstract
The instant invention is directed to a lipid osmotic pump, comprising A a core, comprising i a beneficial amount of at least one substantially water insoluble active agent which is lipid soluble and or lipid wettable ii a sufficient amount of at least one water immiscible lipid carrier, which is liquid at the temperature of intended use, to dissolve and or suspend said active agent and iii a sufficient amount of at least one osmotic agent to ensure release of said lipid carrier from the pump and B surrounded by a water insoluble wall i having a thickness of about 1 to 1000 microns ii which is preferentially wetted by said lipid carrier over an aqueous solution of said osmotic agent iii having a water permeability of about 1 x 10 ¹⁸ to 4 x 10 ¹⁵ cm³ sec g iv prepared from at least one polymer permeable to water but substantially impermeable to said osmotic agent and v having a means for said active agent and lipid carrier to be released through said water insoluble wall.
