# A disposable preselected volume capillary pipet device and method of preparing a liquid sample for testing.

## Abstract
A disposable preselected volume capillary pipet device comprises a capillary tube having an admitting emitting end for liquids and a vent end for passing air from the tube as the liquid is being drawn into the tube by capillary action, a port at the admitting emitting end for admitting and emitting liquids to the capillary tube, a port at the vent end of the tube for passing air freely from the tube, a barrier plug for passing air and stopping the passage of liquid through the tube, with the barrier plug being positioned in the tube at a preselected dis tance from the admitting emitting port to define a liquid chamber of preselected volume, and a plunger for pushing the barrier plug from the vent end to push the preselected volume of liquid out of the liquid chamber. The barrier plug may be mounted in the tube or in the head of the plunger. The method includes admitting a volume of liquid to be tested into the capillary tube by capillary action, venting the air in the tube through the barrier plug and the vent end during the admitting of the liquid into the capillary tube by capillary ac tion, stopping the admitting of the liquid when the liquid con tacts and wets the barrier plug to obtain a preselected volume of liquid in the chamber, and discharging the liquid from the chamber by pushing the barrier plug through the chamber.
