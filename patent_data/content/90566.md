# Semiconductor device package.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device having a hermetically sealed pack age comprises a package substrate 1 having a gold layer 2 , an integrated circuit chip 5 attached to the gold layer, a metal terminal chip 6 attached to the gold layer to ground it. Bonding wires 10, 12 connect the integrated circuit chip 5 and the metal terminal chip 6 to leads 4 . The package is completed by a cap 13 , and glass layers 3, 14 which seal it. The metal terminal chip 6 has a lower coating layer 9 made of a gold silicon type of alloy for bonding to the gold layer 2 and an upper layer 8 of aluminium silicon alloy to enable the bonding wires 10, 12 to be bonded onto it. The bond strength of such a metal terminal chip 6 does not decrease when it is subject to a heat treatment when the package is sealed.
