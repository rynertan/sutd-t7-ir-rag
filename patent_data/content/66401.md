# Non linear amplifiers utilizing positive feedback.

## Abstract
In order to provide a constant current driven, diode controlled logarithamic amplifier with a logarithmic re sponse at very small input current values, the amplifier stage 12 has a feedback network 18, 24 which provides positive feedback only at low input current values.
