# Process for preparing polyurethane compositions emitting reduced amounts of toxic fumes on burning.

## Abstract
A process of forming polyurethane compositions which emit reduced amounts of toxic smoke on burning is described. The process comprises reacting a mixture of an organic compound having two or more active hydrogen atoms, an organic polyfunctional isocyanate, a catalyst and at least one metal salt of an aliphatic or alicyclic mono carboxylic acid wherein the metal is cobalt, copper, nickel or manganese. The metal salt is added to the mixture in an amount which is sufficient to reduce the formation of toxic substances when the polyurethane is ignited.
