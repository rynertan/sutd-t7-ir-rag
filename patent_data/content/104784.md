## Description
VEHICLE PERFORMANCE ADVISORY SYSTEM The present invention relates to an advisory system which displays instructions to the operator of a vehicle, which aid the operator to operate the vehicle in an efficient manner. The invention relates in particular to a performance advisory system for a powered vehicle having a multi ratio transmission, comprising an electronic control unit responsive to engine torque to indicate when the driver can shift to a higher gear. The productivity and fuel consumption of a tractor depend upon the operator s judgement in adjusting the tractor controls during field operation. In the past, it has been suggested to provide vehicles with monitors so that the operator can be informed of the status of various operating parameters of the vehicle.For example, vehicle monitors have monitored vehicle parameters, such as engine rpm, wheel slip, ground speed, drawbar pull and power, fuel consumption, engine power output and efficiency. However, with these monitoring systems, the operator must still rely on his own judgement to determine what control adjustments are needed to optimize the operating parameters of the vehicle. A system has been proposed Emerging Problems Energy,Environmental Protection H F B Goehlich, AgriculturalEngineering, June 1979, pp 25, 26 according to which drive torque is measured to indicate engine load and the operator is signalled to shift to a higher gear when the engine load drops below a certain level. Another system US 4 150 497 signals when to shift up and down in dependence upon engine speed. Such known systems are not able to indicate the most efficient points at which to change gear, particularly having regard to the non uniform spacing of the gears in a typical multi gear vehicle such as an agricultural tractor. The object of the present invention is to provide an improved system which overcomes this problem. The invention is characterised in that the control unit responds to engine speed and engine torque to calculate in accordance with the gear ratios of the transmission the highest gear which will maintain the existing ground speed without the engine torque exceeding a predetermined maximum torque and without the engine speed falling below a predetermined minimum speed, and by display means which display the calculated gear and the corresponding engine speed. The control unit can contain, in memory, data corresponding to an engine torque speed characteristic of the engine and data relating to the gear ratios. Since the optimum gear setting and reduced engine speed are displayed to the operator, the transmission may be shifted to the optimum gear setting and the engine speed may be adjusted via a conventional throttle or engine speed control to the reduced engine speed.This optimum setting moves the engine inato a more efficient operating range, resulting in reduced fuel consumption for the same productivity. In this manner, fuel economy may be obtained while maintaining a desired productivity or travel speed when operating under light draft conditions, such as when the tractor is pulling a planter. The e invention will be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig 1 is a schematic illustration of a tractor and implement system including the present invention. Fig 2 is a flow chart illustrating an algorithm which is executed during operation of the present invention. Fig 3 is a graphical illustration of an engine torque, speed and fuel characteristic of a typical diesel engine. A conventional agricultural vehicle, such as a tractor 10, includes a conventional multi ratio transmission not shown powered by a conventional engine not shown . An implement requiring less than full power of a tractor, such as the planter 12, may be pulled by the tractor 10. The transmission is controlled in the conventional manner by manipulation of shift levers 14. A gear ratio transducer 16, such as a conventional rotary potentiometer, provides a signal which represents the actual gear ratio of the transmission. An engine speed sensor 18, such as a conventional tachometer, provides a signal which represents the speed of the engine.The gear ratios and engine speed signals are communicated to a control unit 20 which may include conventional analog to digital converters, multiplexers, memory and computational components, such as a conventional microprocessor. The control unit processes the gear ratio and engine speed signals and generates information therefrom for display on a conventional alpha numeric display 22 which may be located in a suitable location in the tractor operator s compartment. The control unit 20 executes the algorithm 100 which is shown in Fig 2. First, at 101, an index or integer i is set to a ralue representing the current gear setting of thetransmission. For example, if the transmission is in fourth gear, then F will be set equal to 4. Next, at 102, the current value Ni of the engine rpm is obtained from sensor 18. Then, at 104, the current engine speed value Ni is compared to a rated engine speed value Nr .The rated engine speed value Nr and the data contained in the graph of engine torque vs. engine speed , shown in Fig 3, are contained in a data array in memory, such as a look up table, for use in the algorithm leo0. If the sensed engine speed Ni is not greater than then rated engine speed Nr t, then the routine proceeds to step 126 where the index is set equal to the index i .Then, at 128, the present gear and the present engine rpm are displayed on display 22 so that the operator will know that the present gear ratio and engine speed are appropriate. however, if the sensed engine speed Ni is greater than nor , then step 104 directs the algorithm to step 106 where the gear ratio GR L of the present gear is obtained from a lookup table, also contained in memory. Then, at 108, the present torque Ti of the engine is determined from the equation Ti Tm Nf Ni Nf Nr where Tm is a maximum torque value from the engine characteristic shown in Fig 3 and Nf is a fast idle engine speed value at maximum govenor setting. Alternatively, the engine torque value Ti could be determined by using commercially available torque sensing devices. Then, at step 110, integer j is set equal to the integer i representing the present gear setting. Then, at 112, the integer j is increased by 1. Next, at 114, the gear ratio GR j, corresponding to the next highest or jth gear setting, is obtained from memory. Then, at 116, the engine speed value, Nj which would maintain the same travel speed at the higher gear ratio, GR j, is calculated from the equation Nj Nix GR i GR j Next, at 118, the torque, Tj , corresponding to engine speed, Nj , is calculated from the equation Tj Ti x NiX Then, step 120 directs the algorithm to step 124 if the calculated torque value ITi is greater than the maximum torque value Tm otherwise, the algorithm proceed to step 122.Step 122 directs the algorithm back to step 112 for further incrementing of the integer n if the calculated engine speed value Nj is not less than the minimum engine speed value Nmin otherwise, step 122 directs the algorithm to step 124.The minimum engine speed value Nmin is contained in memory and is the engine speed corresponding to the lowest permissible speed established for the engine. Step 124 decreases index j by 1. Then, step 128 causes display 22 to display to the operator the gear setting and the engine speed corresponding to the value of index n, After step 128, the algorithm returns to step 101 for re execution o the algorithm 100. In short, the algorithm 100 repetitively increments index j and recalculations the new engina speed and torque values which would result if the same travel speed were maintained at the higher jth gear. This process is repeated until the calculated torque T exceeds the maximum torque Tm or until the calculated engine speed Nj falls below the minimum engine speed Nmin . If these conditions are obtained, then index j is decreases by 1 so that step 128 will cause the display 22 to display to the operator the highest gear and the corresponding engine speed at which the tractor 10 can be driven without exceeding the maximum torque value Tm and without falling below the minimum engine speed Nmin . By shifting up to this higher displayed gear, the operator can reduce engine speed to the displayed value while operating at the same productivity travel speed . This conserves fuel because the entire torque speed characteristic moves to the left viewing Fig 3 along curves of constant horsepower 200 into more fuel efficient operating ranges and toward curves of lower constant brake specific fuel consumption, BSFC, 210. Conversion of the above described flow chart into a standard language for implementing the algorithm described by the flow chart in a digital data processor, such as a microprocessor, will be evident to those skilled in the art.
