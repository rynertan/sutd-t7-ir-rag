# Polypropylene membranes.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a substantially skinless microporous polypropylene membrane characterized by having a a bubble point in the range of from 25 to 50 psi b a thickness in the range of from 3 to 7 mils c a nitrogen flow rate of at least 0.5 liters per square centimeter minute d a burst strength of at least 10 psi and e an S value of about 15, or less. There is also disclosed a method of preparing a micro porous polypropylene membrane comprising heating a mixture of about 30 percent polypropylene and about 70 percent, N,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl tallowamine, by weight, to a temperature and for a time sufficient to form a homogeneous solution, casting or extruding said solution at a thickness in the range of from 3 to 7 mils, onto a chill roll maintained at a temperature in the range of from 50 to 80 C, allowing the solution to solidify on the chill roll to form a solid sheet, removing the solid sheet from the chill roll and removing at least a substantial portion of the liquid from the sheet to form the microporous polypropylene membrane.
