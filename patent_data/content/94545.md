# Deposition rate monitoring method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A conductive film deposition rate monitoring method for measuring the real time deposition rate of a metallic deposition process particularly an electroless plating bath 3 , including the steps of positioning an eddy current proximity detector 11 within a predetermined distance of a test surface where the deposition is to be deposited, and the step of monitoring the output of the detector, The apparatus comprises an eddy current proximity sensor 11 and a non metallic housing 13 for the sensor, having a non conductive wall of predetermined thickness between the sensor and the surface of the wall distant from the sensor, the distant wall being immersed in the deposition environ ment, such as a plating bath, so that a deposit takes place on the distant surface, and measuring means 17 25 connected to the output of the sensor for measuring the amplitude and rate of change of the output of the sensor.
