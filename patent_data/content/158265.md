R4 is preferably C1 7 alkyl, most preferably methyl.The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula I include acid addition salts with conventional acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, boric, phosphoric, sulphuric acids and pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids such as acetic, tartaric, maleic, citric, succinic, benzoic, ascorbic, methanesulphonic, a keto glutaric, a glycerophosphoric, and glucose l phosphoric acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula I are usually acid addition salts with acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, citric, tartaric, lactic and acetic acid.Preferably the acid addition salt is the hydrochloride salt.Examples of quaternary derivatives of the compounds of formula I include the compounds quaternised by compounds such as Rg Q wherein R8 is C16 alkyl, phenyl C1 6 alkyl or Cg 7 cycloalkyl, and Q is a radical corresponding to an anion of an acid. Suitable examples of R5 include methyl, ethyl and n and iso propyl and benzyl and phenethyl. Suitable examples of Q include halide such as chloride, bromide and iodide.The compounds of formula I may also form pharmaceutically acceptable N oxides.The compounds of the formula I , their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, quaternary derivatives and N oxides may also form pharmaceutically acceptable solvates.It will of course be realised that the compounds of the formula I have chiral or prochiral centres, and thus are capable of existing in a number of stereoisomeric forms, including enantiomers. The invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms, and to mixtures thereof including racemates . The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated or resolved one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. A group of compounds of formula I is of formula II whereinEMI5.1 Rll is halo or C1 6 alkoxy R21 is hydrogen or C1 6 alkoxy R31 is halo or C1 6 alkoxy andR4 is as defined in formula I .Examples and preferred values of the variables are as so described for corresponding variables under formula I .The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate of any of the foregoing, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula III EMI5.2 with a compound of formula IV EMI6.1 wherein one of G and L is COQ1 where Q1 is a group displaceable by a nucleophile, and the other is NH2 and the remaining variables are as hereinbefore defined and thereafter optionally converting any R1, R2, R3 or R4 group to another R1, R2, R3 or R4 group respectively, and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the resultant compound of formula I . Examples of groups Q1 displaceable by a nucleophile include halogen such as chloro and bromo, hydroxy, carboxylic acyloxy such as C14 alkanoyloxy or C1 4 alkoxycarbonyloxy and activated hydrocarbyloxy such as pentachlorophenoxy.If a group Q1 is a halide, then the reaction is preferably carried out at non extreme temperatures in an inert non hydroxylic solvent, such as benzene, dichloromethane, toluene, diethyl ether, THF or DMF.It is also preferably carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as an organic base, in particular a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine or picoline, some of which can also function as the solvent. Alternatively, the acid acceptor can be inorganic, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. Temperatures of Oo 100oC, in particular 10 80 C are suitable.If a group Q1 is hydroxy, then the reaction is generally carried out in an inert non hydroxylic solvent, such as dichloromethane, THF or DMF optionally in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst, such as a carbodiimide, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.When Y is CO the compound of formula IV is preferably in the form of an acid addition salt, such as the hydrobalide, for example the hydrochloride. The reaction may be carried out at any non extreme temperature, such as 10 to 1000C, for example, 0 to sooc. Generally, higher reaction temperatures are employed with less active compounds whereas lower temperatures are employed with the more active compounds.If a group Q1 is carboxylic acyloxy, then the reaction is preferably carried in substantially the same manner as the reaction when Q1 is halide. Suitable examples of acyloxy leaving groups include C14 alkanoyloxy andC1 4 alkoxycarbonyloxy, in which case the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent, such as methylene chloride, at a non extreme temperature for example ambient temperatures in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as triethylamine. C14 alkoxycarbonyloxy leaving groups may be generated in situ by treatment of the corresponding compound wherein Q1 is hydroxy with a C14 alkyl chloroformate.If a group Ol is activated hydrocarbyloxy then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide. It is also preferred that the activated hydrocarbyloxy group is a pentachlorophenyl ester and that the reaction is carried out at ambient temperature.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention may be formed conventionally.The salts may be formed for example by reaction of the base compound of formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic acid.It will be apparent that compounds of the formula I containing an R1, R2, R3 or R4 group which is convertible to another R1, R2, R3 or R4 group are useful novel intermediates. A number of such conversions is possible not only for the end compounds of formula I , but also for their intermediates.For example an R11 R2 or R3 hydrogen substituent is convertible to a halogen substituent by halogenation with a conventional halogenating agent.R4 optionally substituted benzyl as hereinbefore defined may be replaced by other R4. Such R4 benzyl groups may, for example, be removed, when R1, R2 or R3 is not halogen, by conventional transition metal catalysed hydrogenolysis to give compounds of the formula X EMI8.1 wherein the variables are as defined in formula I .This invention also provides a second process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I which comprises N alkylating a compound of formula V , and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, quaternary derivative or N oxide of the resulting compound of the formula I .In this second process of the invention N alkylation comprises the substitution of the N atom depicted in formula V by any group R4 as hereinbefore defined.This may be achieved by reaction of the compound of formula V with a compound R4Q2 wherein R4 is as hereinbefore defined and Q2 is a leaving group.Suitable values for Q2 include groups displaced by nucleophiles such as C1, Br, I, OS02CH3 or OSO2C6H4pCH3. Favoured values for Q2 include C1, Br and I.The reaction may be carried out under conventional alkylation conditions for example in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of an acid acceptor such as potassium carbonate. Generally the reaction is carried out at non extreme temperature such as at ambient or slightly above.Alternatively, N alkylation may be effected under conventional reductive alkylation conditions when the final group R4 in the compound of formula I contains a methylene group adjacent to the N atom in the bicycle. Interconverting R4 in the compound of the formula IV before coupling with the compound of the formula III is also possible. Such interconversions are effected conveniently under the above conditions. It is desirable to protect any amine function in the compound of formula IV with a group readily removable by acidolysis such as a C27 alkanoyl group, before R4 interconversion.The same reductive alkylation route may be applied for the preparation of relevant intermediates of formula IV , and reference to the preparation of such intermediates hereinafter should be read to include the preparation of the corresponding N acyl intermediates.The substituents in the phenyl ring when R4 is phenylC1 2 alkyl in a compound of formula I , in particular the substituted C14 alkyl substituents, are interconvertible. A number of such interconversions are possible not only for the end compounds of formula I , but also for their intermediates as follows i a carboxy C14 alkyl substituent is convertible to an esterified carboxy C1 4 alkyl substituent by esterification ii an esterified carboxy C14 alkyl substituent is convertible to a carboxy C14 alkyl substituent by de esterification iii an C14 alkoxy C14 alkyl substituent or an in vivo hydrolysable C2 4 acyloxy C1 4 alkyl substituent is convertible to an hydroxy C1 4 alkyl substituent by de etherification iv a hydroxy C1 4 alkyl substituent is convertible to C1 4 alkoxy C1 4 alkyl by O alkylation or to in vivo hydrolysable C1 4 acyloxy C1 4 alkyl by O acylation.Conversions i to iv are only exemplary arid are not exhaustive of the possibilities.In regard to i and ii , the esterification and deesterification reactions are carried out in conventional manner.In regard to iii , a C14 alkoxy C14 alkyl substituent is convertible to an hydroxy C1 4 alkyl substituent by conventional methods, soch as warming with aqueous hydrobromic acid or by treatment with pyridine hydrochloride, boron tribromide, boron triiodide or iodotrimethylsilane. An in vivo hydrolysable C2r4 acyloxy C1 4 alkyl substituent is convertible to an hydroxy C14 alkyl substituent by acid or base hydrolysis.In regard to iv , O alkylation is carried out under conventional conditions in an inert solvent at a nonextreme temperature such as ambient temperature or slightly above or at reflux temperature. The C14 alkylating agent has a leaving group that is readily displaceable by a nucleophile. Examples of leaving groups include halide, such as chloride, bromide or iodide, or labile acyloxy groups, such as mesyl and tosyl.O acylation is carried out under conventional conditions with an acylating agent which has an acyl group capable of forming an in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy group and leaving group, such as halide, for example chloride and bromide, and hydroxy. When halide is the leaving group, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a base. When hydroxy is the leaving group, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in an inert solvent at non extreme temperature, such as ambient temperature or slightly above, or reflux temperature.Before carrying out any of these conversions, the effect, if any, on other substituents should be considered, and such reagents as are appropriate should be selected together with the adoption of such precautionary measures as are necessary. For example,O alkylation and 0 acylation may also produceN alkylated and Nacylated products respectivelyunless the nitrogen atom s is are previously protected. This may be conveniently achieved by carrying out the alkylation or acylation reaction in a strong acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, which protonates, and thereby protects, the nitrogen atom s .The compounds of formula III and IV are known or are preparable analogously to, or routinely from, known compounds, such as those described in European PatentPublication No.13138 and US Patent No. 4336259.As mentioned hereinbefore te compounds of formula I exist in a number of stereoisomeric forms, in particular the moiety X,Y as hereinbefore defined can be in the axial or the equatorial orientation to the bicyclic ring system. A mixture of such isomers can.be obtained by a non stereospecific process and then the desired isomer separated conventionally from the mixture by, for example, chromatography. Compounds of the formula It therein L is NH2, or their ring N acyl analogues as appropriate as discussed hereinbefore, may be prepared nonstereospecifically from known compounds by the processes illustrated in the US and European Patents mentioned hereinbefore.The compounds of the present invention are 5HT antagonists and it is thus believed may generally be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of migraine, cluster headaches and trigeminal neuralgia.The compounds of the present invention also have anti emetic activity in particular that of preventing vomiting and nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy.The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention, in particular a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate of either of the foregoing and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Such compositions are prepared by admixture and are suitably adapted for oral or parenteral administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions or suppositories.
