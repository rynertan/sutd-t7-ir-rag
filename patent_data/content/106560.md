# Storable, crosslinkable, pressure sensitive adhesive tape.

## Abstract
Pressure sensitive adhesive tape, the adhesive layer of which is a copolymer of alkyl acrylate e.g., isooctyl acrylate and acid e.g., acrylic acid and which differs from the prior art by the inclusion of a small amount of loweralkoxylated amino formaldehyde condensate as a latent crosslinking agent. The adhesive does not become crosslinked until it is heated. After the tape has been applied and heated to cross link the adhesive, it exhibits excellent resistance to common organic solvents and also exceptional resistance to shear failure, especially at elevated temperatures. The adhesive has excellent electrical insulating properties.
