## Description
Polyolefin Compositions Having Improved Impact Strength BACXGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates generally to the field of polyolefin compositions and, more particularly, this invention relates to polyolefin compositions containing inorganic fillers which have high impact strength.Description of the Prior Art Inorganic fillers, such as Group IIa metal carbonates, may be used to modify the solid state mechanical properties of polyolefins, such as by increasing the stiffness, by increasing the upper use temperature, and by improving the dimensional stability of finished products. Economies resulting from replacement of polyolefin by less costly fillers are often additional considerations. Although prior inorganic filler polyolefin compositions exhibit high part rigidity compared to the unfilled polymers, the impact and tensile strengths of such materials are reduced by the presence of the filler. Compatiblizing agents have been incorporated into prior filler polyolefin compositions to improve their properties. Previous attempts to compatiblizeGroup IIa metal carbonates in such compositions have centered on the use of low molecular weight additives such as stearic acid, fatty acid salts, organic borates see U.S. Patent No. 4,073,766, for example , phosphonic acids and phosphonic acid esters see U.S. Patent No.4,098,758 , organofunctional silanes, and the like. Organofunctional silane treatment of Group Ila metal carbonates does little to improve the physical properties of polymer compositions. The other above identified additives often are used to coat carbonates to aid in dispersion and to reduce viscosity.They may also increase the elongation at break and the impact strength. However, the impact improvement is not as large as would be desirable and the tensile strength may actually decrease. It is known that the addition of certain third components, such as an elastomer or plasticizer, to Group Ila metal carbonate polyolefin composites can increase the impact strength and tensile elongation of highly filled resins. The use of polyethylene oxide is described by B. M. Badran et al., J. Appl. Polym. Sci..Vol. 27, at 3669 1982 . These methods detrimentally affect stiffness and tensile strength. Polyolefins grafted with carboxylic acids or anhydrides have been used as compatiblizers for some inorganic filler polyolefin compositions. Wu et al U.S.Patent No. 3,873,643 March 25, 1975 discloses that these graft copolymers retain good tensile strength and elongation even when highly filled. However, these grafted copolymers are soft and relatively expensive to use when compared to ungrafted polyolefins. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to overcome one or more of the problems described above. In accordance with the invention, Group IIa metal carbonate filled polyolefin compositions are provided with a compatiblizing agent to improve impact strength and tensile strength while maintaining stiffness. The compatiblizing agent comprises one or more polyolefins grafted with carboxylic acids or anhydrides. The Group IIa metal carbonate filler may be present in amounts up to about 80 wt. based on the total weight of the composite. The graft copolymer compatiblizer should be present in amounts ranging from about 1 wt. to about 50 wt. based on the weight of the carbonate filler. The compositions of the present invention have increased rigidity compared to unfilled polyolefins and also improved impact strength and tensile strength properties compared to prior Group IIa metal carbonate filled polyolefins with compatiblizers. Surprisingly, small amounts of these grafted copolymers, when blended into polyolefins in the presence of filler, cause large increases in impact strength.When the graft copolymer concentration is increased beyond a small amount, the impact strength levels off or is reduced while the stiffness drops rapidly. These effects were not anticipated, taught or disclosed by Wu et al U.S. Patent No. 3,873,643. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the appended claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Inorganic fillers have been used with polyolefins to increase the stiffness of finished products.Usually, increased stiffness is obtained at the expense of decreased impact strength and tensile strength.According to the present invention, Group IIa metal carbonate fillers are blended with one or more polyolefins and one or more polyolefins grafted with unsaturated carboxylic acids or anhydrides as compatiblizers. It has been found that the presence of a relatively small amount of the compatiblizer results in a product which retains stiffness and has increased tensile and impact strengths compared to the uncompatiblized product or previous compatiblized products. The term polyolefin as used herein with respect to the unfilled polymer or matrix resin includes homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene, propylene, butenes and other unsaturated olefinic hydrocarbons. The term polyolefin as used herein with respect to the compatiblizer refers to the backbone polymer which is grafted with a suitable monomer. Such backbone polymers include homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene, propylene, butenes and other unsaturated olefinic hydrocarbons. Especially preferable in this invention are linear ethylene homopolymers or copolymers. The polyethylenes in both cases preferably have a density of between about 0.910 and 0.965 g cc. The density is preferably at least about 0.940 a high density is generally preferred because of the resulting stiffness of the product. Although the use of high density polyolefin matrix resins and graft copolymer backbones is preferred, lower density polyolefins, such as low density polyethylene LDPE or linear low density polyethylene LLDPE a copolymer of ethylene and a 1 olefin may be used if desired for particular applications, although stiffness generally decreases with decreases in density. The invention is effective independent of the type of matrix resin used. Density and stiffness both increase with increases in the concentration of filler.Increases in the proportion of compatiblizer result in a slight decrease in stiffness. The backbone of the graft copolymers includes homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene with up to 40 wt. of such higher olefins as propylene, 1butene and l hexene and may contain di or triolefins as are used commercially in ethylene propylene terpolymers such as ethylidene norbornene, methylenenorbornene, 1,4 hexadiene and vinylnorbornene. Also, it is preferable sometimes to graft blends of two or more of the above homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers. While the above polymers are useful in preferred embodiments of the invention, they should not be regarded as limiting in any way. The unsaturated carboxylic acids or acid anhydrides used as the grafting monomers include compounds such as fumaric acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, 4 methyl cyclohex 4 ene 1,2 dicarboxylic acid anhydride, bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid anhydride, 1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10 octahydronaphthalene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid anhydride, 2 oxa 1,3 diketospiro 4.4 non 7 ene, bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid anhydride, maleopimaric acid, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, x methylbicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid anhydride, x methylnorborn 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid anhydride, norborn 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid anhydride,Nadic anhydride, methyl Nadic anhydride, Himic anhydride, methyl Himic anhydride and other fused ring monomers described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,873,643 and 3,882,194, both of which are assigned to the assignee hereof, and the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Cografting monomers as described in U.S. Patent 3,882,194 are also useful for preparing graft copolymers useful in the invention. Included among the conjugated unsaturated esters suitable for cografting are dialkyl maleates, dialkyl fumarates, dialkyl itaconates, dialkyl mesaconates, dialkyl citraconates, alkyl acrylates, alkyl crotonates, alkyl tiglates and alkyl methacrylates where alkyl represents aliphatic, aryl aliphatic and cycloaliphatic groups containing 1 12 carbon atoms.Esters particularly useful in the cografted copolymers of this invention are dibutyl maleate, diethyl fumarate and dimethyl itaconate. Among the acids and acid anhydrides particularly useful in the cografted copolymers of this invention are maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, x methyl bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid anhydride and bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid anhydride. It is often desirable to use more than one monomer in either or both classes of monomers in order to control the physical properties of the final products. Graft copolymers suitable for use in this invention may be made by any suitable means, including the methods disclosed in Wu et al U.S. Patent No. 3,873,643, and U.S. Patent No. 3,882,194. Graft or cograft copolymers useful as the compatiblizers of this invention generally comprise about 70 99.999 wt. of polyolefin backbone and about 30 0.001 wt. of the unsaturated carboxylic acid and or carboxylic acid anhydride or mixtures. Especially preferred are graft or cograft copolymers comprising about 70 99.5 of polyolefin backbone and, correspondingly, about 30 0,5 wt.E of the unsaturated carboxylic acid and or carboxylic acid anhydride or mixtures. The Group IIa metal carbonate filler may be present in amounts up to 80 wt. of the total weight of the composition. Preferably, the filler should not be present in amounts greater than about 50 wt .E of the composition. The graft copolymer should be present in amounts ranging from about 1 wt. to about 50 wt. of the weight of the filler, and very preferably no more than about 25 wt. of the weight of the filler. Stiffnesses above certain desired values are unattainable without a relatively high proportion of filler, and the invention finds its greatest utility in such compositions. The tensile impact strength of the inventive compositions tends to peak as the percentage of compatiblizer is increased. Beyond this peak value little improvement in tensile impact strength is made by increasing the proportion of compatiblizer in the compositions. Further increases in compatiblizer content will decrease the stiffness and increase the product cost while having at best only a marginal beneficial effect on tensile impact strength. The Group IIa metal carbonate particle size is selected as an optimization process. Small particles, below about one micron, result in higher tensile impact strengths in the filled product, but the stiffness suffers and more compatiblizer is needed. If larger particles are used, better stiffness is obtained and lower amounts of compatiblizer are required for a lower composite cost , but the tensile impact strength peaks at a lower value. The amount of compatiblizer required to reach a given impact range is proportional to the filler concentration. Particle size should then be selected according to an optimization of desired tensile impact strength, stiffness, and cost of the product. The composite material can be assembled by a number of techniques in which the graft copolymer comes into direct contact with the filler particles. The filler may be precontacted with the graft copolymer either in solution with mixing and subsequent evaporation of the solvent, or by melting the compatiblizer with mixing in the presence of the filler. Then the coated filler can be melt compounded into the matrix polymer.It is also possible to melt blend the compatiblizer in the matrix polymer and then incorporate the filler. The compositions of this invention can be prepared by using a high shear mixing device such as a two roll mill, an intensive mixer e.g. Banbury , single or twin screw extruders, kneaders or other suitable mixers. The preferred method is to combine all constituents, i.e., polyolefin, filler and compatiblizer, in either a twin screw extruder or intensive mixer and work the mixture for a few minutes to achieve a substantially homogeneous composition in which all polymeric components are in the molten state. Precompounding of the three components at higher filler loadings than the intended final use concentrations i.e., in a masterbatch can then be used with additional matrix polyolefin in a second compounding or extrusion to meet the desired final composition. Other ingredients can also be added to the compositions of the present invention in order to improve processing, chemical or physical properties. Among these are antioxidants, heat and W stabilizers, antistatic agents, foaming agents, flame retardant agents, coloring pigments, etc. which are widely used. The filler is preferably dispersed substantially uniformly throughout the blend. Also, it is prefered that the polyolefin matrix resin be non elastomeric in nature. The blend is preferably homogeneous and, although microphases may be present in the blend, it is highly preferable that macrophase behavior be avoided. Articles of use made from the thermoplastic compositions of this invention can be produced by suitable methods of extrusion and or molding and forming techniques known to those skilled in the art. Among these methods are blow molding, injection molding, rotational molding, sheet and film extrusion, pipe extrusion, thermofoaming, lamination and extrusion coating. The composites of the present invention are thermoplastic in nature, and therefore, can be recycled after processing. Although we do not wish to be held to the following mechanism, it is felt that the excellent stiffness strength balance obtained in molded or extruded articles is achieved because very few polar groups are required to form a physical chemical interaction with the filler. The remainder of the graft copolymer is a long chain polyolefin having a structure similar to that of the matrix polymer. This permits good dispersion to be developed and maintained in the molten polymer state and permits the olefin portion of the graft molecules to participate in the solid structure of matrix polymer providing the reinforcement effect. EXAMPLES The following Examples illustrate the compositions of the invention and the methods by which they are made, but are not to be considered as limiting the scope of the invention.Examples 1 3 To a Brabender Plasticorder mixer maintained at 2040C are charged 40 parts by weight CaCO3 Huber H White which is a ground product with a median particle diameter of 2.5 microns , 55 parts by weight high density polyethylene and 5 parts by weight of XMNA graft copoly mer. The polyethylene matrix resin is Chemplex ProductNo. 6009, a 0.85 g 10 min. melt index resin with a density of 0.96 g cc in powder form. XMNA graft copolymer is made by reacting x methyl bicyclo 2.2.l hept 5 ene 2, 3 dicarboxylic acid anhydride XMNA with a high density polyethylene homopolymer whose high load melt index is 3 g 10 min. and whose density is 0.96 g cc to give a grafted material containing 1.5 weight percent XMNA and a melt index of 1.5 gZl0 min. The composition is mixed for 5 minutes at 120 rpm with a roller blade configuration. Example 2, a control, was prepared under identical conditions as the composition of Example 1, but no graft copolymer compatiblizer was used i.e. 40 partsCaCO3 and 60 parts high density polyethylene . A corresponding unfilled control, Example 3, contained 100 parts of the high density polyethylene HDPE and was subjected to the same processing conditions as Example 1. Compression molded plaques were made and their tensile impact strengths were measured according to ASTMD1822 79 on die cut, type L specimens. The flexural moduli 1 secant modulus were measured according toASTM D790 80. The data given in Table I below show the expected boost in flexural modulus for the 40 CaCO3 filled examples over the unfilled control. The impact strength of the filled HDPE without compatiblizer is substantially reduced from the HDPE control without filler. The filled HDPE with compatiblizer retains substantially more of the impact strength of the unfilledHDPE control.

Five compositions were prepared as in Example 1 with the concentration of XMNA graft copolymer fixed at 5 wt. of the total composition with varying concentrations of CaCO3 and the remainder of the composition being HDPE.Five comparative compositions corresponding to these and varying the amount of CaCO3 but containing no compatiblizer were prepared as in Example 2. The impact strengths and percent improvement of the inventive compositions over the corresponding comparative compositions without the graft copolymer compatiblizer are given in Table II.

The composition of Example 9 contains 40 parts by weight of a ground uncoated CaCO3 median particle diameter d 1.8 microns , 4 parts by weight ofHDPE based XMNA graft copolymer and 56 parts by weight ofHDPE homopolymer. The composition was prepared as inExample 1. Example 10 also contains 40 parts by weight of the ground uncoated CaCO3 with 60 parts of the HDPE, but no graft copolymer. Example 11 is identical to Example 9 except that the CaCO3 is the corresponding stearic acid coated version. Example 12 also contains 40 parts by weight of the stearic acid coated CaCO3, 60 parts HDPE but no graft copolymer. Stearic acid contains 0.00352 moles of carboxylic acid per gram of material, whereas XMNA HDPE graft copolymer contains only 0.000084 moles of anhydride per gram. The impact strengths of Examples 9 12 are given in Table III, below. The data show that in the absence of compatiblizer the impact strength of the stearic acid coated CaCO3 composite Example 12 is slightly higher than that of the composite made with uncoated CaCO3 Example 10 . However, in the presence of the graft copolymer compatiblizer of this invention, the impact strengths of the composites Examples 9 and 11 are double those of composites without compatiblizer and more than 20 times as effective on a molar basis.

The coating was done by dissolving 5 grams of the organosilicone compound Union Carbide s Y96023 in 100 cc methanol and 8 cc water with stirring.This solution was added to 100 g CaCO3 with stirring. The mixture was dried in a vacuum oven at 1000C for two hours before blending with the HDPE in a Brabender mixer. The composition of Example 14 comprises 2 parts by weight of a titanate coupling agent Kenrich s KRTTS, isopropyl triisostearoyl titanate , 40 parts of groundCaCO3 d 2.5 microns and 60 parts HDPE prepared by the method of Example 2. The KRTTS contains 0.00113 moles of reactive groups per gram of material. The composition of Example 15 comprises 2 parts by weight of an oxidized oil Chemtall s Dimer C36 18, a 1800 molecular weight, 36 acid number material , 40 parts of ground CaCO3 d 2.5 microns and 58 parts of HDPE prepared by the method of Example 2. Dimer C36 18 contains approximately 0.0011 moles of carboxylic acid per gram of material. The impact strength of Examples 13 15 using the identified commercially available, conventional treatments are listed in Table IV and compared to Example 1.None of them are as effective as the novel compatiblizer of the invention in enhancing the impact strength of theCaCO3 composition. Even though the graft copolymer is present at 5 by weight versus 1 to 2 of the low molecular weight agents, the graft copolymer contains only 0.000084 moles of anhydride groups per gram of material.Thus, this unique compatiblizer has less than one tenth the number of functional groups per gram as compared to the low molecular weight agents, but shows substantially better impact strength.

The compositions of Examples 16 19 were prepared in a Stewart Bolling 35 ib. mixer Banbury at 120RPM in a 4.5 minute cycle. The composition of Example 16 comprised of 100 parts by weight of the HDPE described inExample 1. The composition of Example 17 comprised 30 parts of ground CaCO3 d 2.5 microns and 70 parts ofHDPE. The material of Example 18 comprised 5 parts XMNA graft copolymer described in Example 1, 30 parts CaCO3 and 65 parts HDPE. The composition of Example 19 comprised 5 parts XMNA graft copolymer, 40 parts CaCO3 and 55 parts HDPE. These pelletized compositions were a compression molded for physical property tests and b blown into 16 oz. Boston Round bottles 25 g. weight on an Impco A13 reciprocating screw, blow molding machine. The test properties are given in Table V. Example 17 shows the brittle behavior of CaCO3 HDPE compositions in the absence of the graft copolymer. With the graft copolymer present Examples 18 and 19 the objectives of the present invention of increased stiffness and higher heat deflection without sacrificing tensile strength compared to HDPE are achieved. At the same time, the bottle impact strength of the compatiblized composite is four times greater than that of bottles made with CaCO3 and no compatiblizer Examples 17 and 18 .

Example 21 illustrates a composition containing 50 parts of the polypropylene homopolymer and 40 parts of the CaCO3 of Example 20 plus 10 parts of theHDPE based XMNA graft copolymer. The materials of bothExamples were prepared in a Brabender mixer at 4000F. Examples 22 and 23 are identical to Examples 20 and 21 except the polypropylene matrix resin used was a copolymer Hercules 7623, a 2.0 melt flow rate, 5 ethylene block copolymer . Example 24 shows a composition with 60 parts of a low density polyethylene homopolymer Chemplex 3503 with a 0.925 g cc. density and a melt index of 0.3 and 40 parts of a ground CaCO3 1.8 micron diameter .

In the following Examples 28 39, the effect of filler particle size on impact strength is examined.Examples 28 39 In these Examples the concentration of CaCO3 is fixed at 40 by weight. The graft copolymer, the HDPE and the method of preparation are identical to Example 1.Examples 28 31 employed a ground CaCO3 with d 5.5 microns. Examples 32 35 used a ground CaCO3 with a d 2.5 microns. Examples 36 39 used a ground CaCO3 with d 1.8 microns. The compositions and their tensile impact strengths are given in Table VIII. Note that less compatiblizer by weight is required to show the onset of impact reinforcement and to reach the impact plateau when the particle size is larger. Conversely, the plateau impact range increases as the particle size decreases.Obviously, the amount of compatiblizer required to reach the plateau impact range for a given filler is proportional to the filler concentration.

The data given in Table IX show little additional improvement in impact strength beyond about 12.5 compatiblizer based on the weight of CaCO3. However, the stiffness flexural modulus decreases with further additions of compatiblizer while the composition cost increases.

Using this consideration and other factors described above, namely that the concentration of graft copolymer compatiblizer depends upon the filler concentration, filler particle size and the concentration of grafted anhydride groups, the preferred compatiblizer concentration range is from about 1 to 25 by weight based upon the weight of Group IIa metal carbonates. All parts and percentages herein are by weight unless indicated otherwise. The foregoing detailed description is given for clearness of understanding only, and no unnecessary limitations are to be inferred therefrom, as modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
