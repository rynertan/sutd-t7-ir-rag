## Description
PREPARATION OF AROMATIC POLYESTERS BY DIRECTPOLYCONDENSATION The present invention relates to a process for preparing melt processable aromatic polyesters via the direct condensation of aromatic hydroxy acids, optionally together with aromatic diols and aromatic diacids. Wholly aromatic polyester resins, with the aromatic polyester being considered to be wholly aromatic in the sense that each moiety present contributes at least one aromatic ring to the polymer backbone, have long been known. For instance, 4 hydroxybenzoic acid homopolymer and copolymers have been provided in the past and are commercially available. Those wholly aromatic polyesters normally encountered in the prior art have tended to be somewhat intractable in nature and to present substantial difficulties if one attempts to melt process the same while employing conventional melt processing procedures.Such polymers commonly are crystalline in nature, relatively high melting or possess a decomposition temperature which is below the melting point, and when molten frequently exhibit an isotropic melt phase.Moulding techniques such as compression moulding or sintering may be utilized with such materials however, injection moulding, melt spinning, etc, commonly have not been viable alternatives or when attempted commonly have been accomplished with difficulty. Wholly aromatic polyester resins and in particular such resins which exhibit melt anisotropy are now well known. For example, United States Patent No. 4 161 470 discloses a polyester of 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid and para hydroxybenzoic acid. United States Patent No.4 219 461 discloses a polyester of 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, para hydroxybenzoic acid, aromatic diol, and aromatic acid. United States Patent No. 4 256 624 discloses a polyester of 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, an aromatic diol and an aromatic diacid. Each of these polyesters exhibits an anisotropic melt phase and is capable of readily undergoing melt processing to form quality fibres, moulded articles, etc. An established procedure for preparing aromatic polyesters of fibre forming molecular weight is by thermally reacting acetates with carboxylic acids. In other words, the aromatic hydroxy groups are acetylated.The use of acetylated reactants has been of utmost importance when preparing a polyester of an aromatic hydroxy acid since curtain aromatic hydroxy acid compounds tend to decarboxylate upon direct esterification. For example, para hydroxybenzoic acid is notorious for severe decarboxylation upon attempted direct esterification.Decarboxylation adversely effects the yield of the process, the nature and composition of the final product, and the economic viability of the process. A reaction involving acetylated reactants, however, liberates acetic acid which is corrosive and thus requires the use of special corrosion resistant equipment. A further disadvantage is that the esterified or acetylated reactants are more costly than the unesterified reactants.Accordingly, a polyesterification involving an aromatic hydroxy acid wherein all hydroxy and acid moieties are efficiently and effectively reacted directly would be of advantage since the high cost of using esterified products would be avoided and by product water presents far less of a disposal problem than the acetic acid involved with ester reactants. The polycondensation of a phenolic moiety with an aromatic carboxylic acid moiety, in general, has been found to be impracticable or simply not to work. However, some limited success has been achieved. For example, United States Patent No. 4 093 595 discloses a catalytic procedure for the preparation of polyesters from 1 dihydric phenols and 2 aromatic dicarboxylic acids by direct polymerisation in the presence of an antimony, tin or titanium catalyst. The patent does not, however, address the problem of aromatic hydroxy acid decarboxylation upon direct esterification, nor suggests any method for the direct formation of polyesters such as those disclosed in the aforenotedUnited States Patent No. 4 161 470. Dihydric phenols and aromatic dicarboxylic acids are the only reactants used. William W Lowrance, Jr, in Tetahedron Letters, No.37, pp. 3453 3454 1971 , discloses that phenol esters such as phenyl benzoates can be prepared by direct esterification upon refluxing a solution containing phenol, benzoic acid and catalytic amounts of boric and sulphuric acids. The article does not pertain to the preparation of polyesters or to the direct reaction of aromatic hydroxy acids. Higashi et al in Journal of Polymer Science PolymerLetters Edition, Volume 18, 385 388 1980 , disclose that aromatic polyesters can be prepared directly from aromatic hydroxy acids such a p and m hydroxybenzoic acids, as well as a combination of dicarboxylic acids and bisphenols, by conducting the polycondensation in the presence of hexachlorocyclotriphosphatriazene in pyridine.The use of such a promoter, however, has many disadvantages, e.g. cost. Thus, an easy and economically attractive process for preparing melt processable, aromatic hydroxy acid containing polyesters via the direct polycondensation thereof is heretofore unknown to the prior art. It has now surprisingly and unexpectedly been found that wholly aromatic polyesters of aromatic hydroxy acids can be effectively prepared by direct polycondensation. According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a wholly aromatic polyester comprising reacting in the presence of a catalytic amount of a metallic compound selected from the group consisting of Group IV and Group V metal compounds at least one hydroxynaphthoic acid together with either a at least one hydroxybenzoic acid, or b at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid and at least one aromatic diol under reaction conditions which result in the formation of the aromatic polyester.Preferably the temperature of reaction is sufficient to maintain at least one reactant and the resulting polyester in a molten condition. By the process of the invention the hydroxynaphthoic acid has been found not to decarboxylate. An effective and efficient process of direct polycondensation is thereby achieved. The direct polycondensation of the reactants is accomplished in the presence of a catalytic amount of a metal catalyst, wherein the metal is selected from the group consisting of the metals of Groups IV and V of thePeriodic Table. Preferably, the catalyst is a salt, oxide or organo metallic derivative of either antimony, titanium, tin or germanium, with tin compounds being the most preferred for reasons of catalyst activity. Representative examples of suitable catalysts, without being limited thereto, include the dialkyl tin oxides such as dibutyl and dimethyl tin oxide, diaryl tin oxides such as diphenyl tin oxide, dialkyl tin esters such as dibutyl tin diacetate, stannous sulphate, stannous oxalate, n butyl stannoic acid, dimethoxy tin, titanium dioxide, titanium alkoxides, tetrabutyl titanate, tetraisopropyl titanate, tetraphenyl titanate, dicyclopentadienyldiphenyl titanium, antimony trioxide and germanium dioxide. Dialkyl tin diacetate is the most preferred catalyst. The amount of catalyst employed is a catalytically effective amount, which is an amount sufficient to increase the rate of polymerisation, which can be measured by conventional means such as the inherent viscosity of the resulting polyester. The quantity of catalyst utilized is typically in the range of from about 0.001 to about 5 weight percent based upon the total monomer reactant weight, with from 0.01 to about 1.0 weight percent being preferred, and from 0.05 to about 0.5 weight percent being most preferred. The hydroxynaphthoic acid and hydroxybenzoic acid reactants of the instant invention may have some additional substitution on the aromatic rings beside the hydroxy and carboxyl moieties. Such optional substitution may be with substituents inert in the polymerisation reaction, e.g. alkyl, alkoxy, aryl, halo and mixtures thereof. When the substituent is an alkyl or alkoxy, it preferably contains from 1 to about 4 carbons.When the. substituent is an aryl, it preferably contains from 6 to 10 darbons e.g. phenyl . When the substituent is a halogen, it may be fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The presence of such ring substituents can tend to modify to some extent the physical properties of the resulting polyester polymer, e.g. the polymer may soften at a lower temperature, its impact strength may be improved, and the crystallinity of the solid polymer formed may be decreased. The specific properties desired in the polyester product will influence the choice of substituents on the hydroxy naphthoic acid reactant. In a preferred embodiment, 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid without any further ring substitution is employed in order to provide a polyester of optimum crystallinity in the solid state. Representative examples of substituted hydroxy naphthoic acid reactants include 6 hydroxy 5 chloro 2 naphthoic acid, 6 hydroxy 5 methyl 2 naphthoic acid, 7hydroxy 5 methoxy 2 naphthoic acid, 6 hydroxy 7 chloro 2naphthoic acid, 6 hydroxy 4,7 dichloro 2 naphthoic acid, etc, and mixtures thereof. The amount of hydroxynaphthoic acid employed can vary greatly, but is generally within the range of from about 10 to 90 mole percent of the total monomer reactants.When the hydroxynaphthoic acid is used in conjunction with a hydroxybenzoic acid it is preferred to use from about 15 to 35 mole percent, and most preferably in the range from about 20 to 30 mole percent, e.g. approximately 25 mole percent of the hydroxy naphthoic acid. When the hydroxynaphthoic acid is used in conjunction with aromatic diacids and aromatic diols it is preferred to use from about 20 to 80 mole percent, more preferably about 60 to 80 mole percent of the hydroxynaphthoic acid. If desired, a mixture of hydroxynaphthoic acids may be employed. Although it is preferred to use unsubstituted p hydroxybenzoic acid in order to provide a resulting polyester of optimum crystallinity in the solid state then hydroxybenzoic acids can be used. Representative examples of other suitable hydroxybenzoic acid reactants include 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 2 chloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,3 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 3 ,5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 3 bromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 3 methyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 6 dimethyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 3 methoxy 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,5dimethoxy 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, etc. The amount of hydroxybenzoic acid employed in conjunction with the hydroxynaphthoic acid can vary greatly, but is generally within the range of from about 10 to 90 mole percent of the total monomer reactants, more preferably in the range from about 65 to 85 mole percent, and most preferably in the range from about 70 to 80 mole percent, e.g approximately 75 mole percent. If desired, a mixture of hydroxybenzoic acids may be employed, for example, a mixture of a p hydroxybenzoic acid and m hydroxybenzoic acid. The aromatic dicarboxylic acid or aromatic diol reactants of the instant invention can contain one or more aromatic rings, with the carboxyl groups being attached to the same or different ringsv When the aromatic compounds contain more than one aromatic ring, the rings may be fused, e.g. as in a naphthalene or anthracene moiety or connected by a bond or a divalent radial such as an alkyl, oxy, thio or thionyl or suiphonyl radical. The dicarboxylic acid or diol is preferably symmetrical in the sense that the carboxyl or hydroxyl groups are symmetrically disposed, e.g. para to each other when on one aromatic ring or diagonally disposed, i.e. 2 and 6 positions, when present on a naphthalene ring.If desired, the aromatic ring or rings may bear one or more substituents, such as an alkyl, halo, alkoxy or aryl substituent, which is inert in the polymerisation reaction. When the substituent is an alkyl or alkoxy, it preferably contains from 1 to about 4 carbons. When the substituent is an aryl, it preferably contains from 6 to 10 carbons e.g phenyl , and when the substituent is a halogen, it may be fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine The amounts of aromatic dicarboxylic acid or aromatic diol, when employed, can vary greatly and will depend upon the type of properties the polyester product is to possess.In forming an anisotropic, melt processable polyester, however, it is preferred that the amount of aromatic dicarboxylic acid or aromatic diol used is from about 5 to about 45 mole percent of the total monomer reactants, more preferably from about 10 to about 40 mole percent, and most preferably from about 10 to about 20 mole percent. A slight excess of aromatic diol can be used to compensate for any loss by volatilisation or sublimation. Representative examples of suitable aromatic dicarboxylic acids for purposes of the instant invention include terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 2,6 and 2,7naphthalene dicarboxylic acids , 4,41 biphenyldicarboxylic acid, 4,4 p oxydibenzoic acid, 4,4 p thiodibenzoic acid, 4,41 p thionydibenzoic acid, and mixtures thereof.A particularly preferred aromatic dicarboxylic acid is terephthalic acid Representative examples of suitable aromatic diols include hydroquinone, resorcinol, methylhydroquinone, chlorohydroquinone, bromohydroquinone, phenylhydroquinone, 4,4 biphenol, 4,4 p oxybiphenol, 4,4t p methylbiphenol, 4,4 1 sulphonylbiphenol, 2 ,6 d ihydroxynaphthalene, etc, and mixtures thereof A particularly preferred aromatic diol is hydroquinone. In general, it is preferred to conduct the reaction of the instant invention under conventional conditions for melt polymerisation, with the reaction being conducted in the presence of a catalytic amount of a suitable metal catalyst. The time, temperature and pressure conditions to be employed for optimum results depends on the specific reactants used and on the specifically selected catalyst. It is important, however, that the reactants and the resulting polymer suffer no substantial degradation under the polymerisation conditions. The temperature must be at least high enough so that melt polymerisation may be carried out, i.e. so that at least one of the reactants and the aromatic polyester polymer product is in a melt phase. Temperatures in the range of from about 250at to about 3600C can generally be employed, with a temperature in the range from about 2600C to about 3500C being preferred, and a temperature in the range from about 2700C to about 340at being most preferred. However, the temperature should ordinarily not be so great as to cause degradation of the polymer as may be observed from undue darkening of the polymer. If desired, a vacuum can be applied at a suitable place in the polymerisation to rapidly remove water and to hasten the polymerisation after sufficient reaction has taken place so that the loss of reactants through sublimation or other means is minimised. Other than during the vacuum cycle, the reaction is conducted generally at atmospheric pressure, although this may vary if desired Also, to minimise oxidation, the reaction ispreferably carried out in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon. Other polymerisation techniques, however, e.g. a slurry polymerisation, such as that described in commonly assigned United States Patent No. 4 067 852 of Gordon WCalundann, entitled Melt Processable Thermotropic WhollyAromatic Polyester Containing Polyoxybenzoyl Moiety where the solid product is suspended in a heat exchange medium, may also be employed. The disclosure of the Calundann patent is herein expressly incorporated by reference. The reaction is generally conducted until the desired molecular weight for example, for fibre forming has been reached. Preferably, the wholly aromatic polyesters of the present invention would have a weight average molecular weight in the range from about 2000 to about 200,000, more preferably from about 10,000 to about 50,000, and most preferably from about 20,000 to about 25,000. The molecular weight may be determined by standard techniques not involving the solutioning of the polymer, e.g. by end group determination via infra red spectroscopy on compression moulded films. Alternatively, light scattering techniques in a pentafluorophenol solution can be employed to determine the molecular weight. The inherent viscosity i.e. IV of the polyester can also be measured, and is preferably at least 2.5, and more preferably at least about 3.5, e.g. from 3.5 to 7.5, when dissolved in pentafluorophenol at a concentration of 0.1 percent by weight at 600C. The polyester formed by the process of the present invention is easily melt processable. Unlike the aromatic polyesters commonly encountered in much of the prior art, the wholly aromatic polyester formed is not intractable and forms an anisotropic melt phase whereby an atypical degree of order is manifest in the molten polymer. The resultant polyester readily forms liquid crystals in the melt phase and accordingly exhibits a high tendency for the polymer chains to orient in the shear direction. Such anisotropic properties are manifest at a temperature which is amenable for melt processing to form shaped articles. Such order in the melt may be confirmed by conventional polarised light techniques whereby crossed polarisers. are utilised.More specifically, the anisotropic melt phase may conveniently be confirmed by the use of a Leitz polarising microscope at a magnification of 40X with the sample on a Leitz hot stage and under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer melt is optically anisotropic, i.e. it transmits light when examined between crossed polarisers. The amount of light transmitted increases when the sample is sheared i.e. is made to flow , however, the sample is optically anisotropic even in the static state. The present invention provides one with a more economically attractive and direct, yet efficient, method for preparing such wholly aromatic melt processable polyesters than has previously been known. The use of acetylated reactants and the disadvantages thereof are avoided by the process of the instant invention. The present invention, therefore, allows one to prepare said valuable polyesters of aromatic hydroxy acids e.g. a hydroxynaphthoic acid and a hydroxybenzoic acid much more cheaply and easily so that their advantages may be more readily exploited. The following examples are given as specific illustrations of the claimed invention. It should be understood, however, that the specific details set forth in the examples are merely illustrative and in no way limit ing.. All parts and percentages in the examples and the remainder of the specification are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates the preparation of a wholly aromatic copolyester from 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 6hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid. A 300 ml 3 neck flask was fitted with a sealed glass paddle stirrer, a gas inlet and distillation head plus condenser and a graduated receiver. The flask was charged with 27.6 gm of 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 0.2 mole and 56.4 gm of 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid 0.3 mole .Catalyst as indicated in Table 1 below was added in various amounts based on the total charge. The flask was sparged with argon, then heated at 3000C for one hour in an oil bath under a slow stream of argon. Initially, the melt was clear and straw coloured, but water rapidly distilled out and the melt went first cloudy, then opaque. The water steadily distilled over, and the temperature was raised to 3200C for 90 minutes by which time the melt was quite viscous. Vacuum 0.5 mm was then applied for one hour. A total of 13 to 14 mls 7277 of theory of water generally collected in the receiver, accompanied by a small amount of phenol. The polymer colour was pale cream through yellow, depending on the particular catalyst used. Strong stiff fibres with a characteristic woody fracture could be drawn from the melt The polymer was broken from the flask, ground in a Wiley Mill and extracted with acetone for two hours in aSoxhlet apparatus to remove low molecular weight materials4. The physical properties are set out inTable 1. The polymer was then micro melt spun through a single 0.007 inch hole spinneret, with fibre properties then being measured The spinning conditions and fibre properties are set out in Table 2.

Dibutyl tin diacetate 1800 ppm on total charge was used as a catalyst. The polymerisation was heated via an oil bath at 2600C for 30 min, 2800C for 30 min, 2900C for 30 min, 3000C for 30 min, and 3200C for 30 min. A vacuum 0.5 mm was then applied for 20 minutes at 3200C. The melt was opaque, creamy and very viscous. Strong fibres could be drawn from the melt. A total of 15 ml water 83 theory distilled out. The polymer was isolated as previously described in Example l. The polymer had a Tm of 2900C determined by DSC and an IV of 4.6. The ratio of hydroxybenzoic acid to hydroxynaphthoic acid units was determined to be roughly 40 60 by FTIR. The polymer was then melt spun at 3450C at 0.42 g min through a 0.007 inch hole and wound up at 75 m min. The as spun properties were determined to be tenacity 8.6 g d elongation 2.2 percent modulus 593 g d After a heat treatment in a relaxed state at 3000C for 4 hours, the properties were tenacity 15.3 g d elongation 3 percent modulus 510 g d EXAMPLE 3 A wholly aromatic copolymer or hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxynaphthoic acid was prepared by reacting 48.3 g 0.35 mole of 4 hydroxybenzoic acid with 28.2 g 0.15 mole of 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid. Dibutyl tin diacetate was used as the catalyst 1800 ppm on total charge .The reaction mixture was heated for 1 1 2 hours at 300 C and at 3200C for 30 minutes, by which time it was very viscous. Strong fibres were pulled from the melt.The total yield of water was 17 ml, 94 theory . The isolated polymer had a Tm of 2400C, an IV of 6.7 and theFTIR analysis showed a hydroxybenzoic acid hydroxynaphthoic acid ratio of approximately 65 35. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A A copolymer of hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxynaphthoic acid was prepared in accordance with the procedure of Example 1, but in the absence of a catalyst.The reaction was heated from 260 C to 3100C in increments of 100C over 3 hours, and was concluded at 3200C under vacuum for 15 minutes. A total of 14 ml of distillate was collected, but this contained much phenol. The polymer was very dark in colour. No fibres could be drawn. The resulting polymer had an IV of 1.86, and the FTIR showed that the hydroxybenzoic acid to hydroxynaphthoic acid ratio was only 20 80, In other words, a very large proportion of the hydroxybenzoic acid had been lost by means of decarboxylation into phenol and carbon dioxide in the absence of a catalyst as employed in accordance with the instant invention. EXAMPLE 4 A 300 ml 3 neck flask was fitted with a sealed glass paddles stirrer, a gas inlet tube and a still head and condenser. The flask was charged with 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid 46.4 gm, 0.3 mole Hydroquinone 12.0 gm, 0.11 mole Terephthalxc acid 16.6 gm, 0.10 mole Dibutyl tin d.iacetate 0.2 gm catalyst The system was purged by evacuation and flushed with argon three times, and then heated in an oil bath and stirred under a slow stream of argon at 280 C. Water slowly began to distil out of the melt. After one hour, a total of 2.6 mls of water 29 theory had collected.The temperature was raised to 3000C for 30 minutes, then to 3200C for 30 minutes and finally to 3400C for 30 minutes.A total of 5 mls 56 of water was collected. During the later stages of the reaction, sublimated solid was melted back into the reaction mixture with the aid of a hot air blower applied to the upper part of the still head. A vacuum 0.5 torr was then slowly applied and the mixture was heated and stirred under vacuum at 3400C for a total of 95 minutes. The opaque melt grew more viscous until at the end of the vacuum cycle it was beginning to climb up the stirrer shaft. The vacuum was then released with argon and the stirrer being withdrawn from the tan coloured, opalescent melt. Long, stiff fibres could be drawn from the molten polymer attached to the stirrer blades The rest of the polymer was allowed to cool under argon, and then broken out of the flask and separated.Its inherent viscosity as a 0.1 solution in pentafluorophenol at 6aOC was 3c15. When subjected to differential scanning calorimetry DSC , it showed a Tm endotherm at 2750C. The polymer was then ground in a Wiley Mill. The powdered polymer was melt spun through a single 0.007 inch spinneret hole at 300QC at a throughput of 0.14 gmfainute and was wound up at 101 metres minute. The as spun yarn had a tenacity of 6.1 grams per denier elongation of 1.1 percent modulus of 664 grams per denier, and a denier of 9 6. The physical properties of the as spun fibres may be further enhanced by heating in an inert, such as nitrogen, atmosphere, e.g. at about 3000C for about four hours.
