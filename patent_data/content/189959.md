## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF POLYSACCHARIDE AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a polysaccharide aqueous solutions, rtore particularly aqueous solutions of polysaccharides of the succino glucan type. A polysaccharide of the succino glucan type may be defined as a heteropolysaccharide comprising glucose and for each 7 moles of glucose, 0.9 to 1.2 moles of galactose and 0.65 to 1.1 moles of pyruvate, together with succinate and acetate in molar proportions for each 7 moles of glucose between 0 and 2.Microorganisms which produce such polysaccharides are herein referred to as polysacccaride producing microorganisms of the succino glucan type . Fran EP A 40445, Applicants ref K 1480 , a process is described for the production of a polysaccharide of the succino glucan type which comprises cultivating a slime forming species of Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Alcaligenes orAgrobacterium, e.g. Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 11264, Pseudernonas sp.NCIB 11592 or mutants thereof, under aerobic conditions in an aqueous nutrient medium and recovering the polysaccharide from the polysaccharide containing medium. In EP A 138255 Applicant s ref K 1924 , there is described an improved process for the production of a polysaccharide of the succinooglucan type, involving the cultivation of Agrobacterium radiobacter NCIB 11883. Products which are attained fran the processes of EP A 40445 orEP A 138255 have been found to require prefiltration if they are to pass through a cellulase a acetate filter of pore filter 1.2 m e.g. a 1.2 m Millipore filter Minipore is a trademark . Ability of a polysecchazide solution to pass through such filter is a useful indication that the polyvaccharide will function satisfactorily in enhanced oil recovery operations, in that the injection of the polysaccharide oontaining aqueous displacement formulation into the oil or gas bearing rock formation will not be hindered by material which can cause plugging of the snail pores of the rock formation. US Patent 4,416,990 describes the use of Basidiomycete cellulase to treat an aqueous dispersion of a xanthan gum containing bacteria cell residues and microgels as impurities in order to improve the injectability and filterability of the xanthan gum in oil formations and thus improving the recovery of crude oil. GB 2065688B describes a treatment of a polysaccharide with an endoen2yme capable of hydrolysing at least one of the linkages between sugar units of the polysaccharide, in order to enhance the ability of a polysaccharide in an aqueous solution to flow through a porous medium. A process has now been found for improving injectability and filterability of polysaocharides of the succino glucan type. The present invention prodes a process for the preparation of a polysaccharide aqueous solution, wfiich comprises aerobically fermenting an assimilable carbohydrate source with a polysaccharide producing microorganism of the succino glucan type in an aqueous nutrient medium characterised by adding cellulase to the fermentation broth. The amount of cellulase which is added to the fermentation broth depends, inter alia, on the level of activity of the enzyme and the concentration of microorganisms. However, in general cellulase may conveniently be added at a rate in the range 0.01 to 0.2gl 1, preferably 0.05 to 0.2gl 1. The term cellulase refers to any enzyme able to break down theA l4 link of cellulose. Examples of commercially available enzyme preparations possessing cellulase activity include Cellulase CP ex SturgeLtd, Cellulase AC ex Miles Biochemicals, Cellulosin AP exMiles Biochemicals, Xylanase ex Miles Biochemicals, Celluclast ex Novo, and cellulase ex. Gist Brocades B.V. Preferred suitable polysaccharide producing microorganisms comprise the group consisting of Rhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium trifolii, Alcaligenes faecalis var. myxogenes, Agobacterium tumefaciens, Agrobacterium radiobacter, Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Pseudomonas spp. and mutants thereof. Particularly preferred are the species Agrobacterium radiobacter NCIB 11883,Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 11264, and Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 11592. The polysaccharides products which can be obtained with the present process e.g. aqueous polysaccharide solutions, can conveniently find employment as water thickeners which are used in oil and gas exploration and prcducticn operations. Possible applications of polysaccharides in this field of technology can be expected in completion , work over , drilling and fluid displacement formulations. However since the present process is in particular an excellent method for removing potential plugging particulates fran the polysaccharide formulation, the polysaccharide aqueous solutions abstained with the present process find advantageous application as thickeners in aqueous fluid displacement solutions in enhanced oil recovery operations. The present invention will be further understood fran the following Examples. Example I A batch fermentation with Agrobacterium radiobacter strainNCIB 11883 was carried out at a pH of 7 and a temperature of 360C in the following medium. KH2PO4 0.68gl 1MgSO4 7H2O 0.49 gl 1MnSO4 4H2O 0.44mgl 1ZnSO4 7H2O 0.57mgl 1H3BO3 0.06mgl 1Na2MoO4 2H2O 0.24mgl 1 NH4 2SO4 0.79gl 1CaCl2 2H2O 7.35mgl 1CuSO4 5H2O 0.25mgl 1CoCl2 6H2O 0.23mgl 1KI 0.16mgl 1FeSO4 7H2O 13.9mgl 1Glucose 25gl 1Broth samples were taken at the end of cell growth 7 hours, determined by optical density measurement end of growth marked by constant value , and at glucose exhaustion a further 70 hrurs, determined by analysis of fermentation broth . A similar fermentation was carried out, except that cellulase 0.2gl 1 was added with the iuoculum of NCIB 11883.Samples were taken as above. Samples 80ml were diluted x 13 v v by addition of 12 volumes of aqueous 15 w v Naci 1.5 w v CaC12, mixed for 2 minutes using an Ultraturrax trade mark mixer , and filterability was tested by measuring the rate of flow through a 1.2 m, 47mm diameter Millipore trade mark filter, at 30 C, with 40 psi overpressure. Figure 1 gives the results. Curve A is for the untreated broth end growth and curve B for untreated broth glucose exhaustion . Curve C is for the cellulase treated broth end growth and curve D is for the cellulase treated broth glucose exhaustion . Filterability of the treated broth is in both cases markedly superior. Example II A batch fermentation with Agrobacterium radiobacter strainNCIB 11883 was carried out as in Example I. At the end of cell growth, cellulase 0.2gl 1 was added to the broth, and the fermentation allowed to proceed to glucose exhaustion. Filterability of the broth diluted x 10 was tested as in Example 1. Figure 2 shows the result for this broth curve A catpared to broth where no cellulase is added curve B .Filterability of the treated broth is markedly superior. Example III A batch fermentation with Agrobacterium radiobacter strainNCIB 11883 was carried out as in Example I. At glucose exhaustion, the broth pH was adjusted to 5.5, and cellulase was added to 0.1, 0.05 or 0.019gl 1. Broth was incubated at 40 C, and harvested after 1.8 hours. Filterability was measured as in Example I. Results are in Figure 3. Treatment with O.lgl curve A , 0.05gl 1 curve B or 0.019 gl 1 curve C cellulase gave a large improvement over the untreated broth curve D .Example IV A batch fermentation with Agrobacterium radiobacterium strainNCIB 11883 was carried out as in Example I. At glucose exhaustion, the broth pH was adjusted to 5.5, and one of a number of commercially available cellulase preparations was added 0.2gl . After 5.75 hours incubation at 400C, broth filterability was tested as in Example I x10 dilution .Results are in Figure 4. Addition of 0.2gl 1 Cellulase CP Sturge Ltd. curve A , cellulase Gist Brocades curve B , Cellulase AC Miles Biochemicals curve C , Cellulosin AP Miles Biochemicals curve D , Xylanase Miles Biochemicals curve E or 0.2ml.1 Celluclast vvvo curve F gave a dramatic improvement in filterability compared to the untreated broth curve G . EcpxpleV A batch fermEntation with Agrobacterium radisbaeter strainNCIB 11883 was carried out as in Example I. A sample of broth was taken at glucose exhaustion, and the remainder of the broth treated with cellulase 0.2gl 1 for 7 hours at PB 5.5 and 400C. Filterability was measured as in Example 1 x 10 dilution .Results are given in Figure 5. Cellulase treated broth curveA had excellent filterability. Non treated broth filtered poorly curve B . If 500ml of solution prepared from cellulase treated with was followed by non cellulase treated solution, blocking occurred rapidly after the change of solution curveC . If cellulase was added to a nonotreated product immediately prior to filtration, blocking occurred rapidly curve D . Ihese results demonstrate that the above results are due to action of cellulase on the microbial broth, and not on the cellulose acetate of the Millipore trademark filter.
