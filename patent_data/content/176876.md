# Method of calcining carbonaceous bodies, in particular electrodes, in either continuous or intermittent furnaces, and a containment structure for the implementation thereof.

## Abstract
A method of calcining carbonaceous bodies, in particu lar electrodes such as those employed in the production of aluminum or steel, in either continuous or intermittent furnaces with the use of containment structures whereinto carbonaceous bodies 9 to be calcined are placed and then covered at least laterally with a carbonaceous powder 8 , is characterized in that the structure walls are caused to collapse from the sides outwards on the occurrence of the expansion whereto the carbonaceous bodies are subjected during calcination. The containment structure which affords implementation of the method comprises a base frame 1 , refractory supports 2 placed on said frame 1 and carrying refractory plates 3 forming the loading platform, and a sideway complying edge 20 formation on expansion of the carbonaceous bodies.
