# Single stage autophage rocket.

## Abstract
An autophage rocket has its casing 12 , which stores liquid propellant 14 , in the form of a single wall of a material which is itself combustible. As the propellant 14 is consumed during flight, the casing 12 is combusted. A plurality of rocket motors 24, 26, 28, 30 are fed with the liquid propellant 14 and combustion products from the liquid propellant 14 and the casing 12 pass through an expansion nozzle 36 . The distance between the front 16 of the rocket casing and the motors is progressively reduced as the casing burns.
