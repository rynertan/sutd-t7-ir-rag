# Imaging sensing and processing apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Image sensing and processing apparatus in which the different colours of a subject 12 are sensed by a linear image sensor 20 to provide a high resolution electrical colour separation signal and a low resolution electrical colour separation signal which is stored in a memory 42 . An enhanced high resolution electrical colour separation signal is thereafter provided as a function of the colour matrixing of the low resolution electrical colour separation signals with the high resolution electrical colour separation signals.
