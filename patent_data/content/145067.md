The most preferred compounds is d , alpha iminobis methylene bis 3,4 dihydro 2H l benzopyran 2 methanol r a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof. In order to simplify the structural representations of the compounds I and of a number of starting materials and intermediates used in the preparation thereof, the radical EMI4.1 will hereinafter be represented by the symbol D1 while the radicalEMI4.2 will hereinafter be represented by the symbol D2. The compounds of formula I may generally be prepared by N alkylating an amine of formula II a or II b with an intermediate of formula III a respectively III b following art known N alkylating procedures.EMI4.3 In III a and III b W represents an appropriate reactive leaving group such as, for example, halo, e.g., chloro, bromo or iodo, or a sulfonyloxy group, e.g. methylsulfonyloxy or 4 methylphenylsulfonyloxy. It is evident from the structure of the intermediates of formulae III a and III b that in the particular case where R respectively R is hydrogen the said reagents may previously be converted into the corresponding oxiranes having the formulaEMI5.1 or that the said oxiranes as such are used as intermediates. The alkylation reactions are conveniently conducted in an inert organic solvent such as, for example, an aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g., benzeneimethylbenzene, dimethylbenzene, and he like a lower alkanol, e.g., methanol, ethanol, l butanol and the like a ketone, e.g., 2 propanone, 4 methyl 2 pentanone and the like and ether, e.g., 1,4 dioxane, l,l oxybisethane, tetrahydrofuran and the like N,N dimethylformamide DMF N,N dimethylacetamide DMA nitrobenzene l methyl 2pyrrolidinone and the like. The addition of an appropriate base such as, for example, an alkali metal carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, sodium hydride or an organic base such as, for example, N,N diethylethanamine or N 1 methylethyl 2 propanamine may be utilized to pick up the acid which is liberated during the course of the reaction. In some circumstances the addition of an iodide salt, preferably an alkali metal iodide, is appropriate. Somewhat elevated temperatures may enhance the rate of the reaction. The compounds of formula I can also be converted into each other following art known procedures of functional grouptransformation. Some examples will be cited hereinafter. The compounds of formula I having a nitro substituent can be converted into their corresponding amines by stirring and, if desired, heating the starting nitro compounds in a hydrogen containing medium in the presence of a suitable amount of an appropriate catalyst such as, for example, platinum on charcoal, palladium on charcoal, Paney nickel and the like catalysts. Suitable solvents are, for example, alcohols, e.g., methanol, ethanol and the like. The compounds of formula I wherein RÚ is a phenylmethyl radical can be converted into the compounds of formula I wherein R is hydrogen following art known hydrogenolysis procedures. The compounds of formula I wherein R and or p3 is are hydrogen may be converted into the corresponding compounds of formula I wherein R2 and or R3 is are C1 12 alkylcarbonyl or arylcarbonyl by reacting the former compounds with an appropriate carboxylic acid or a suitable functional derivative thereof. In all of the foregoing and in the following preparations, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction mixture and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art. The compounds of formula I have basic properties and, consequently, they may be converted to their therapeutically active non toxic acid addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids, such as hydrohalic acid, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic and the like, and sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like or organic acids, such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, 2 hydroxypropanoic, 2 oxopropanoic, ethanedioic, propanedioic, butanedioic, Z 2 butenedioic, E 2 butenedioic, 2 hydroxybutanedioic, 2, 3 dihydroxybutanedioic, 2 hydroxy 1,2,3 propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, 4 methylbenzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, 2 hydroxybenzoic, 4 amino 2 hydroxybenzoic and the like acids.Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form. From formula I it is evident that the compounds of this invention may have several asymmetric carbon atoms in their structure. Each of these chiral centers may be present in a R and a S configuration, this R and S notation being in correspondence with the rules described in J. Org. Chem. 35 9 , 2849 2867 1970 . Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula I may be obtained by the application of art known procedures.Diastereoisomers may be separated by physical separation methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g., counter current distribution, and enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. It is evident that the stereochemically isomeric forms may be further resolved into their optical isomers, and by the application of methodologies known to those skilled in the art.Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula I are naturally intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention. In many compounds and starting materials the stereochemical configuration is not experimentally determined. In those cases it is conventionally agreed to designate the stereochemically isomeric form which is first isolated as A and the second as B , without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. For the most preferred compound, , iminobis methy1ene Jbis 3,4 dihydro 2H 1 benzopyran 2 methanol , it has experimentally been determined that the A form corresponds with the RS or SR configuration at the chiral centers 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 while the B form corresponds with the SS or RR configuration at the said chiral centers.EMI7.1 A number of intermediates and starting materials in the foregoing preparations are known compounds which may be prepared according to art known methodologies of preparing said or similar compounds. A number of such preparation methods will be described hereinafter in more detail. The intermediates of formulae II a and II b may generally be prepared by reacting an amine of formula IV with a reagent of formula III b respectively Ill a following the same procedure as previously described herein for the preparation of the compounds of formula I .EMI8.1 In a number of particular cases the reaction of IV with III b or II1 a and the consequent reactions of the thus formed II a or II b with a reagent III a or III b , thus yielding the desired compound of formula I , may be conducted during the same N alkylation reaction procedure. As it is described for the preparation of the compounds of formula I the intermediates of formula III a and III b may also previously be converted into the corresponding oxiranes having the formulae III a l and III b l or said oxiranes may be used as such as intermediates. The intermediates of formulae III a and III b may be prepared following art known procedures for preparing oxiranes, e.g. by epoxidizing a corresponding alkene or by reacting an appropriate aldehyde with a suitable reagens, such as a trimethylsulfoxonium halide or a trimethylsulfonium halide. The intermediates of formulae III a l and III b l are new and as useful intermediates in the preparations of the compounds of formula I they constitute an additional feature of the present invention. The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and stereochemically isomeric forms possess strong ss adrenergic receptor blocking activity and as such they can be used in the treatment and prevention of disorders of the coronary vascular system. Due to their useful ss adrenergic receptor blocking activity and, more particularly, in view of their selective Bl adrenergic receptor blocking activity, combined with their vasodilating properties, resulting in a useful antihypertensive activity, the compounds of formula I , the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof are useful agents in the treatment and the prevention of disorders of the coronary vascular system. In view of their useful properties in the treatment and the prevention of disorders caused by the coronary vascular system the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention an effective amount of the particular compound or compounds, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingre diet, is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, said amount being an amount which is effective to normalize irregular cardial rhythms. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally or by parenteral injection.For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Acid addition salts of I , due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets including scored or coated tablets , capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. The amount of active ingredient per dosage unit is from about 0.25 mg to about 1000 mg and, preferably from about 0.5 to about 500 mg. In view of the usefulness of the subject compounds in the treatment and the prevention of disorders of the coronary vascular system it is evident that the present invention provides a method of treating and or preventing disorders caused by the coronary system in vertebrates by the systemic administration of an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I , an acid addition salt or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof in admixture with a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The following examples are intented to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the present invention. Unless otherwise stated all parts therein are by weight. EXPERIMENTAL PARTA.

Guinea pig right atrium Spontaneously beating right atria were dissected from guinea pigs 400 50 g . A triangular strip of atrium, including the sinoatrial node was excised together with the anterior vena cava.The vena was fixed to a glass muscle holder and the opposite atrial muscle was connected to a Grass isometric transducer. Atria were suspended at optimal preload in a 100 ml Krebs Henseleit solution, containing 2 g l glucose, at 37.50C and aerated with 95 2 and 5 C02. Heart rate and contractile force were recorded by means of aGrass FT03C isometric transducer. Output signals amplified by an isometric transducer amplifier J.S.I. via a cardiotachometer J.S.I. were recorded on Honeywell XYY recorder.After a stabilisation period of 45 min. isoprenaline was infused in linearily increased doses for a period of 7 min. This produced a dose related increase in heart rate a . After washing out isoprenaline a stabilisation period of 15 min. was allowed. A drug was then added to the bath fluid for 30 min. During this incubation period possible direct chronotropic and inotropic effects of the drug were determined.Following this, a second dose response curvetfor isoprenaline was produced by infusion during 10 minutes b . The slope of the increase in rate was graphically estimated for each period of isoprenaline addition and the ratio b a was calculated. Based on solvent experiments a ratio of less than 0.70 was considered as the criterion of inhibitory activity. ED 50 values were estimated graphically.2. Guinea pig tracheal ring B2 . The trachea was dissected from guinea pigs 400 50 g . Four rings, approximately 8 mm. in width, were then cut from each trachea.Cartilaginous parts of the tracheal ring were mounted horizontally between two metal rods, one of which was attached to a glass organholder, the other rod being connected to a Grass isometric transducer. Using such a technique the tracheal smooth muscle is suspended optimally i.e. midway between the cartilaginous parts. The prepared rings were suspended in a 100 ml organ chamber filled withTyrode solution, maintained at 350C and aerated with 958 2 and 5 C02. The preparation was maintained at tension of 1.5 g throughout the experiment. Tension changes recorded were thus an expression of contraction or relaxation. After a stabilisation period of 30 min. contraction was induced by adding methacholine lpg ml to the bath for a 10 min. period. Addition of isoprenaline 0.08 pg ml for 4 min.in the presence of methacholine induced a relaxation of the tracheal ring. This procedure was repeated twice before adding the drug t 33 t 19 and once 30 min. after addition of the drug. During the incubation period any direct effects of the drug were measured. A 50 inhibition of the agonist induced response was used as the criterion of effectiveness and ED50 values with fiducial limits were determined by probit analysis. The ratio of the ED values obtained in respectively the 50 tracheal ring test ss2 and in the right atrium test ssl may be considered as an index of the cardioselectivity of the test drug.Typical results obtained in the above experiments with a number of the compounds of formula I are given in the following table I which is only intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the invention.
