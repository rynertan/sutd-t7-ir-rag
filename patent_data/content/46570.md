# Respiration monitoring apparatus.

## Abstract
A respiration monitoring apparatus which comprises meters 22, 26 for determining the flow rate of air flow and the airway pressure of the living body fitted with an artificial respirator 18 a monitor 44 for displaying the waveforms of output signals from the meters 22, 26 . The apparatus further comprises a signal processing circuit 28 which detects the end of the respective expiratory periods from the marks indicated by the output signals from the meters 22, 26 which denote the flow rate of breathed air flow, stores the average value of the airway pressures determined at the end of the respective expiratory periods, and, where the mea sured airway pressure determined falls below the stored average value, issues a detection signal denoting this condition, thereby changing a display pattern on the monitor 44 .
