# Method and apparatus for producing monocellular layers of cell containing biological fluid.

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus are provided for producing monocellular layers of cell containing biological fluid, such as blood, by spinning a sample slide bearing a sample to be analyzed. In the practice of the improved method and use of the improved apparatus, the slide is positioned with the sample bearing surface thereof facing downwardly so that the force of gravity aids, rather than hinders, monocel lular layer formation. Such layer formation is further facili tated by spinning of the slide in a holder provided with integral wall means shielding the sample from the buffeting effect of circumambient air to thereby avoid premature drying of the sample, minimize cell distortion and prevent aerosol formation.
