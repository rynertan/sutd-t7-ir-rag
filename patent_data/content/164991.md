# METAL DISINTEGRATION MACHINING APPARATUS

## Abstract
In the replacement of old split pin assemblies of a guide tube of a nuclear reactor by new split pin assemblies, each old split pin assembly is severed into readily removable fragments by metal disintegration machining apparatus. This apparatus includes an insulating block, e.g., of glass and a metal disintegration electrode which is axially perfo rated, water under pressure is injected into the arc region through the perforation. Also disclosed is a pick and put tool, and a crimping tool for crimping a locking cap to the nut of a replaced new split pin assembly.
