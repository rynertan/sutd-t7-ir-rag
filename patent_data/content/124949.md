# Mixer arrangement comprising first and second quadrature mixer stages.

## Abstract
Mixer arrangement M comprising first and second quadrature mixer stages M, resp. M₂ to which quadrature mixing signals are applied from an oscillator circuit F₀ , these two mixer stages M₁ and M₂ being coupled to a superposi tion circuit S₀ . To suppress interferences occurring in the output signal of the superposition circuit due to oscillator crosstalk or leakage and or a d.c. offset of the mixer stages M₁ and M₂ which are supplied with mixing signals by the oscillator circuit F₀, the quadrature components of these inter ferences being in phase with the quadrature mixing signals are measured by means of first and second synchronous detectors SD₁ resp. SD₂ to which detection carriers are applied in an in phase or an anti phase relationship with respect to the quadrature mixing signals. After sign inversion these quadrature components are fed back to the inputs of the two mixer stages M₁ and M₂ , resulting in an interference negative feedback.
