# Data processing system with improved interrupt handling.

## Abstract
Certain device interrupts, distinguished at XVCT interrupts, are handled using four regions on main memory. The interrupt code is held in two locations LOC 1,2 in the first region and the code in the first location LOC 1 enables an XVCT interrupt to be recognised. The contents of the second location LOC 2 are then used as a displacement to point to a location in the second region which is an XVCT table with an entry for each interrupting device. These entries in turn point to areas within the third region, a device control table DCT . Each such area contains firstly a pointer to the interrupt routine in the fourth memory region for the device in question, secondly a MASKcode which identifies the other devices which are prevented from interrupting while the device in question is serviced and a processor status register word PSR which determines whether or not a fixed point overflow condition is to be enabled. Execution of the selected interrupt routine is preceded by a conventional stack save PUSH operation and followed by a restore POP operation.
