# Pattern forming apparatus and product orientor therefor.

## Abstract
An in line pattern forming apparatus includes a windowed endless roller conveyor disposed in a longitudinal system path for sequentially receiving sets of articles. A friction shoe shifts the set of articles through the conveyor window to an underly ing turntable which is rotatable for selectively reorienting the set, whereupon the lead roller at the end of the window pushes the set off the turntable to a staging support which sequentially receives a plurality of sets to form a pattern. The pattern is then swept as a unit from the staging support to a container loader or other associated apparatus in the system path. Means may be provided for selectively shifting sets of articles on the stag ing support laterally of the path to facilitate formation of certain patterns.
