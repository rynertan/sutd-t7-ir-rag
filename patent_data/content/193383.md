# Power transfer device for four wheel drive.

## Abstract
In combination with a power transmission, a power transfer device comprises a transfer casing 16 detachably secured to a transmission casing 13 , a first differential 20 rotatable within the transmission casing and having an input gear casing driven by an output gear of the transmission, a second differential 30 coaxial with the first differential having an input gear casing integral with an output element of the first differential and rotatable within the input gear casing of the first differential, a carrier member 43 rotatably mounted within the transfer casing and arranged coaxially with the first and second differentials, a first axle 41 connected with an output element of the second differential and extending outwardly from the transmission casing, a second axle 42 connected with another output element of the second differential and extending outwardly from the transfer casing through the carrier member, a hollow shaft 23a in surrounding relationship with the second axle and connected at its opposite ends with another output element of the first differential and the carrier member, and a clutch sleeve 46 axially slidably mounted on the hollow shaft to be selectively engaged with the input gear casing of the first differential. The clutch sleeve is arranged to be axially slidably coupled with the carrier member and to be posi tioned by engagement with the carrier member in a circum ferential direction.
