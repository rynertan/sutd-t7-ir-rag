# Friction open end spinning apparatus.

## Abstract
A friction spinning apparatus and process use at least one perforated roller 2 enclosing a suction sleeve 4 having the static pressure applied along its suction slot 5, 6, 7 changing between a tip end of the fibre bundle forming the yarn and a downstream location of the fibre bundle whereby the tip end is subjected to a weaker suction effect holding it against the surface 2 than is the stronger downstream part of the fibre bundle.
