## Description
This invention relates to new pyrazole derivatives which are useful as the herbicidal agent, processes of producing these pyrazole derivatives and also uses of these pyrazole derivatives. More particularly, this invention relates to a new N arylpyrazole derivative represented by the general formula I given hereinafter, as well as a herbicidal composition comprising said N aryl pyrazole derivative as active ingredient. This invention further relates to processes for the production of said new N arylpyrazole derivatives. Certain kinds of pyrazole derivatives are already known to exhibit such physiological activities utilizable as agricultural chemicals. For instance, Japanese patent publication No. 19958 65 discloses that a class of N phenylpyrazole derivatives represented by the formula wherein R₁ is a hydrogen atom or phenyl group, R₂ is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, R₃ is a hydrogen atom, nitro group or cyano group and R₄ is a lower alkyl group, amino group or a lower alkoxy group shows herbicidal activity. Besides, Japanese patent publication No. 14833 67 discloses that an N nitro substituted phenyl pyrazole derivative or an N chloro nitro substituted phenyl pyrazole derivative represented by the general formula wherein X is Cl or H exhibits fungicidal activity and is useful to control fungicidal infections in crop plants such as tomato, rice and kidney bean. Nonetheless, such N phenylpyrazole derivatives of which the phenyl nucleus is bearing halogen atoms at the 2 and 4 positions and a hydroxy group or substituted hydroxy group at the 5 position in accordance with this invention, as be seen with the new compounds of this invention, have never been known before our invention, as far as we are aware of. Additional herbicidal pyrazole derivatives are described in DE A 3402308, EP A 171 544 and EP A 138 527.

With the above mentioned attempt, we have synthetized a number of pyrazole derivatives and researched the utilities of the pyrazole derivatives so synthetized. As result, we have now found that a class of N phenyl pyrazole derivatives represented by the general formula I as given hereinafter is new compounds which have never been disclosed in any literatures and that these new N phenyl pyrazole derivatives of the general formula I exhibit significantly high herbicidal activity and are useful as a herbicidal agent in practice.

The reaction may proceed at room temperatures, but is preferably carried out at a higher temperature up to the refluxing temperature of the solvent used, under heating. After the completion of the reaction, the solvent may be removed from the reaction mixture by distillation to recover the desired reaction product. Alternatively, the desired product may be recovered by extracting the reaction mixture with water and an organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform and distilling off the solvent from the extract to obtain the desired product. Process A is illustrated in Examples 1 to 5 hereinlater given. This process is applicable to the preparation of compounds I B , i.e. those of general formula I where R The hydrolysis may be effected simply by heating compound I C together with water or in an aqueous organic solvent, but usually carried out in the presence of one equivalent or more of a basic compound. As the base, there may be used typically an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. The reaction may proceed either at room temperatures or under heating.

After the completion of the reaction, the reaction solution is made acidic with the addition of an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid and then extracted with an organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform. The removal of solvent from the extract by distillation yields the desired compound of formula I B . Process B is illustrated hereinlater in Examples 6 to 8. This process is applicable to the preparation of compounds I D i.e. those of general formula I where R This substitution reaction may usually be conducted in an organic solvent in the presence of an acid binding agent.

The reaction temperature may be appropriately chosen from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent used. After the completion of the reaction, the desired product may be isolated in many cases by distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture. If necessary, however, water and an organic solvent may be added to the reaction mixture to extract the desired compound and the solvent may be distilled off from the extract to afford the desired compound of formula I F .

This process is applicable to the preparation of compound I H , i.e. those of general formula I where at least one of R wherein R₁ is as explained above but except hydrogen, and R₂, X and Y are as defined above The nitration reaction may usually be effected in a solvent, for example,an inorganic acid such as sulfuric acid an organic acid such as acetic acid water or a mixture of an acid and water. As the nitrating agent, there may be used usually nitric acid and fuming nitric acid. The reaction temperature may be appropriately chosen from a temperature under cooling with ice water to the refluxing temperature of the solvent used. After the completion of the reaction, the desired compound may be recovered, for example, by adding water to the reaction mixture, extracting the desired compound with an organic solvent such as benzene toluene, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform and distilling off the organic solvent from the extract to leave the desired compound. Process E is illustrated by way of Example 18. This process is applicable to the preparation of compounds I J , i.e. those of general formula I where at least one of R where R₁ is as explained above but except hydrogen and R₂, X, Y, The reduction may be effected, in general, using iron or tin or nascent hydrogen as reducing agent. Usually, water is used as solvent. In most cases, the addition of a small amount of hydrochloric acid to the water can promote the reaction intended. The reaction temperature may be appropriately chosen from a temperature under cooling with ice water to the refluxing temperature of water. Warming up of the reaction mixture may promote the reaction, shortening the reaction time. After the completion of the reaction, the desired compound may be recovered by extracting the reaction mixture with an organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform and distilling off the solvent from the extract to leave the desired compound. Process F is illustrated by way of Example 19. This process is applicable to the preparation of acylamino substituted compounds I K , i.e. those of general formula I where at least one of R where R₁, R₂, X, Y, In cases where the acyl group of the acylating agent to be used in this process G is a lower alkylcarbonyl, a lower alkoxycarbonyl or a di lower alkylaminocarbonyl group, the acylation reaction may be carried out using as acylating agent a lower alkanoic acid chloride a lower alkyl chloroformate or a di lower alkylcarbamoyl chloride, respectively, in an organic solvent such as benzene, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, acetone and acetonitrile in the presence of an organic or inorganic acid binding agent, including an organic base such as triethylamine and pyridine and an inorganic base such as anhydrous sodium carbonate and anhydrous potassium carbonate. The reaction temperature may be properly chosen from a temperature under ice water cooling to the refluxing temperature of the solvent used. After the completion of the reaction, the desired compound may be recovered from the reaction mixture by adding thereto water and an organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform, separating the organic layer thus formed and distilling off the organic solvent to leave the desired compound. In cases where the acyl group of the acylating agent to be used in this process G is a mono lower alkylaminocarbonyl group, the acylation reaction may be conducted by using a lower alkyl isocyanate in an inert solvent such as benzene, ether, tetrahydrofuran and acetone at a temperature ranging from room temperature to the refluxing temperature of the solvent used. The reaction may be accelerated by adding a catalytic amount of a tertiary amine such as triethyl amine or an organotin compound such as dibutyltin diacetate. After the completion of the reaction, the desired compound may be isolated by distilling off the solvent used from the reaction mixture. Process G is illustrated by way of Example 20. Now, referring back to process A , the substituted phenylhydrazine compounds of formula II A which is to be used as starting compound are also new compounds. The phenylhydrazine compounds of formula II A where R₂ is sulfonyl or a substituted sulfonyl group may be prepared by process H given below which starts from a corresponding substituted phenol of formula V . where R is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or aryl group. Intermediate compounds VI , VII and VIII given above are also novel compounds. In process H , substituted phenol V is first reacted with a sulfonyl halide RSO₂Cl or RSO₂Br to cause sulfonylation of the phenolic hydroxyl group to form sulfonyloxy compound VI . The sulfonylation is preferably carried out in pyridine which may serve not only as solvent but also as the acid binding agent. Usually, this reaction is effected in such a manner that a sulfonyl halide is added dropwise to a mixture of a dihalophenol and pyridine under cooling with ice cold water, followed by stirring the reaction mixture at room temperature. If a long time is required for the completion of the reaction, heating to a suitable temperature which may be up to the boiling point of pyridine makes it possible to significantly shorten the reaction time. After the reaction, pyridine salt thus deposited is filtered off and the pyridine solvent is distilled off to leave sulfonyloxy compound VI . This compound may also be obtained from the reaction mixture above by adding water and an organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform to extract the compound intended, VI , washing the extract with a dilute hydrochloric acid to remove pyridine and distilling off the solvent used. Nitro compound VII may be prepared by nitrating sulfonyloxy compound VI with nitric acid. The nitration may be carried out under such mixed acid condition as usual. Thus, to a mixture of 95 sulfonic acid and sulfonyloxy compound VI , is added dropwise a mixture of an equivalent amount of concentrated nitric acid and 95 sulfuric acid under ice water cooling,followed by stirring the reaction mixture at room temperature until the nitration reaction becomes complete. Thereafter, the reaction mixture is added to ice pieces for dilution, to which an organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform is added to extract the desired nitro compound. Then, the solvent is distilled off from the extract to isolate the nitro compound. Nitro compound VII is then reduced by iron to give amino compound VIII . The reduction may usually be conducted in water as solvent with the addition of a small amount of hydrochloric acid to promote the reaction. Heating the reaction mixture to a temperature of 50 100 C is preferred to shorten the reaction time. After the completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is extracted with an organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform. The removal of the solvent from the extract by distillation yields sulfonyloxyamino compound VIII . Subsequent diazotization of amino compound VIII followed by reduction with stannous chloride and hydrochloric acid results in the formation of hydrazino compound II A . The diazotiazation may be effected by adding amino compound VIII to aqueous hydrochloric acid, followed by adding an equivalent amount of aqueous sodium nitrite solution dropwise to the resulting mixture at about 20 C. The subsequent reduction may be achieved by adding the resulting diazonium salt solution to an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid and stannous chloride under ice cooling, followed by stirring the mixture at room temperature. After the completion of the reaction, the mixture is made weakly alkaline with the addition of an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, then extracted with an organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform. The removal of the solvent from the extract by distillation affords hydrazino compound II A . The preparation of the hydrazine compound II A according to process H is illustrated later in Example 22.
