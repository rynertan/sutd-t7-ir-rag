# Production of semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
Onto the surface of an initial semiconductor structure 1, 2, 3, 4 is deposited a layer of an organic material 5 having a window 9. Layers 6 , 7 , and 8 are deposited on the exposed surface of the semiconductor, of which 8 is an ion beam resisting material. Corresponding layers 6, 7, and 8 are deposited on the organic material. The organic material is then lifted off together with layers 6. 7 and 8. Ion beam milling of the semiconductor material to either side of 8 followed by removal of any remnant of 8 results in a structure having an elevated semiconductor portion carrying an electrode 6 , 7 . Preferred materials are gallium arsenide for layers 1 and 3, gallium aluminium arsenides for layers 2 and 4, titanium for layers 6 and 8 , and gold for layer 7 . The invention can be applied to the production of rib waveguide electrooptic devices, including phase modula tors.
