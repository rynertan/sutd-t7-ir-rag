# Tape spool.

## Abstract
Tape spool 10 in the passage, that opens through the tape winding surface 16, 18 , pinches the leader 42 only in a region remote from the opening 48 through the tape winding surface 16, 18 , so that if the leader 42 is accidentally crimped or off center, it would tend to straighten out before emerging from the opening 48 .
