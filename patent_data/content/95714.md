# Expandable thermoplastic polymer particles and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
Disclosed are expandable thermoplastic polymer parti cles and process for preparing the same. Expandable thermoplastic polymer particles superior in processability as well as expansion are prepared by controlling an amount of inside moisture contained in said particles coat ed or impregnated with a blowing agent to not more than 1 by weight based on polymer, immediately after prepared.
