## Description
Heterocyclic Derivatives This invention relates to novel heterocyclic derivatives having action on histamine receptors, to processes for the preparation thereof, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and two their use in therapeutics. Certain novel heterocyclic derivatives have now been found which have potent activity as H2 antagonists. These compounds, which are more particularly described below, for example show inhibition of the secretion of gastric acid when this is stimulated via histamine receptors Ash and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmacol. Chemother, 1966, 27, 427 . Their ability to do so can be demonstrated in the perfused rat stomach using the method described in British Patent Specification Number 1565966, modified by the use of sodium pentobarbitone 50 mg kg as anaesthetic instead of urethane, and in conscious dogs equipped with Heidenhain pouches using the method described by Black et al, Nature 1972 236, 385Furthermore, the compounds antagonise the effect of histamine on the contraction frequency of isolated guinea pig right atrium. Compounds with histamine 112 blocking activity may be used in the treatment of conditions where there is an advantage in lowering gastric acidity, particularly in gastric and peptic ulceration, as a prophylactic measure in surgical procedures, and in the treatr nt of allergic and inflammatory conditions where histamine is a known mediator. Thus they may be used for exarele, either alone or in combination with other active ingrenients in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin.

Particularly useful salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulphates, methanesulphonates, acetates maleates, succinates, citrates, tartrates, fumarates and benzoates. The compounds of formula I and their salts may also form hydrates, which hydrates are also to be considered as part of the invention. The compounds cf formula I can exhibit tautomerism and the formula is intended to cover all tautomers. Where optical isomers may exist the formula is intended to cover all diastereoisomers and optical enantiomers.The term bioprecursnrs as used nerein means compounds which have a structure different to that of the compounds or formula I but which, upsn administration to the animal or human being are converted in the body into a compound of formula I . The compounds according to the invention preferably in the form of a salt may be formulated for administration in any convenient way and the invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound according to the invention adapted for use in human or veterinary medicine. Such compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.

It will be appreciated that in the methods of the preparation of compounds of formula I given below, for certain reaction steps it may be necessary to protect various reactive substituents in the starting materials for a particular reaction artd subsequently to remove the protecting group. Such protection and subsequent deprotection may be particularly pertinent where R1 and orR2 in intermediates used to prepare compounds of formula I are hydrogen atoms and or when R3 in intermediates is an alkyl group bearing a hydroxy substituent and or whenR7 in certain intermediates is an alkyl group bearing a hydroxy or primary or secondary amino substituent and or when R5 in intermediates is a hydrogen atom. Standard protection and deprotection procedures can be empolyed.For example an amino group may be protected by formation of a phthalimide which may subsequently be cleaved by treatment with a hydrazine e.g. hydrazine hydrate or a primary amine, for example methylamine or by formation of a benzyl derivative which may subsequcntly be cleaved by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a catalyst e.g.palladium. When A and B both represent N and R3 is hydrogen, this may be protected by formation of a Nalkoxyalkyl e.g. ethoxymethyX derivative which may subsequently be cleaved by treatment with dilute acid.The hydroxyl group OR5 where R5 is hydrogen may be protected, for example as an acyloxy grt or as an ether group such as trialkylsilyl e.g. trimethylsilyl, aralkyl such as benzyl, benzhydryl or trityl, tetrahydropyranyl or alkoxymethyl, e.g methoxymethyl ethers.Such protecting groups may be removed by conventional procedures cf JFW McOmie. For example, benzyl and benzhydryl ether groups may be removed by catalytic hydroqenolysis with for example hydrogen and a palladium catalyst, and trityl, tetrahydropyranyl, alkoxymethyl and trialkylsilyl ether groups may be removed by acid hydrolysis. In describing the processes which may be used for preparing the compounds of formula I or intermediates useful in the preparation thereof, any of R1 to R24 Alk, Q, Z, p, n and mare as defined in formula I unless otherwise stated. Compounds of formula I may be prepared by cyclisation of an appropriate intermediate. Thus, compounds of formula I in which R5 represents hydrogen and Z represents the groupEMI12.1 where either A represents CR7 and B represents N or A represents N and B represents CR7, and R7 is other than acyloxyalkyl, alkoxy, nitro, CH2 gN CRl,Rl6, SQ2Rl7, COR20 where R20 is hydrogen, aryl or aralkyl orCR23 NR24, or when A represents CR7 and B reprezents N then R3 and R7 may not represent the group fCH CHt2 or CH2 4 may be prepared by cyclising a compound of formula III EMI12.2 in which R25 is as defined for R3., V isEMI13.1 or NCN andY is hydrogen where V is oxygen or sulphur and R7 is a group as defined for R7 or a group convertible thereto under the conditions of the cyclisation reaction or R7 represents halogen or alkoxy or V is NR3, R25 is hydrogen and Y isEMI13.2 where.Y is sulphur, oxygen or NH. Thus for example in one embodiment of the cyclisation process a compound of formula I in which A isN and B is the group CR7 may be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of formula IV EMI13.3 in which V is NCN or NC V R7 where R7 is as defined above, V represents sulphur or more preferably oxygen andU represents two hydrogen atoms, in the absence or, presence of a solvent, e.g. acetone or water, and optionally with heating. It may be convenient to prepare in situ compounds of formula IV in which U represents two hydrogen atoms by treating a compound of formula IV where U represents a divalent protecting group which can readily be removed to yield two hydrogen atoms, for example a benzylidene group, with an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, optionally in the presence of an additional solventr e.g. toluene and conveniently at a temperature of 10 500C. Under such conditions cyclisation to give thc orresponding compound of formula I will normally occur. In general the intermediate of formula IV may be prepared from the appropriate diamines by methods analogous to those described in British Patent SpecificationsNumbers 2047238A, 2023133A and 2075007A. In another embodiment of the cyclisation process compounds bf formula I in which A is e group CR7 and B is N may be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of formula V EMI14.1 in which Y .is oxygen. The cyclisation may be carried out in the absence or presence of a solvent e.g. dimethylformamide , at elevated temperatures e.g. within the range 80 3500 optionally in the presence of a base e.g. aqueous potassium hydroxide. In a convenient embodiment of the cyclisation process the intermediate V may be formed in situ by reacting an aminoguanidine of formula VI EMI14.2 with cyanogen bromide or with an acid R7CO2H or an activated derivative thereof, such as an acid halide e.g. R7COCl or a trialkylorthoester e.g. R7C OEt 3 .The reaction may be carried out by heating the acid and the aminoguanidine VI under which conditions cyclisation of the intermediate V takes place directly to give a compound of formula I . In the case of an activated derivative an aprotic solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran may be used at temperatures from ambient to reflux.When using an acyl chloride as the activated derivative the reaction may also be carried out in the presence of a base, e.g. a tertiary amine such as pyridine, which may also be used as the solvent. The reaction with cyanogen bromide may be carried out with heating, optionally in the presence of a solvent such as an alkanol e.g methanol. The aminoguanidine VI may be prepared, for example by reacting a diamine of formula VII EMI15.1 with a compound of formula VIII EMI15.2 where L is a leaving group suchas throalkyl, e.g.thiomethyl. Compounds of formula I in which R5 is hydrogen and Z is as defined in formula I except C X NHR8 and except that when A or B represents the group CR7 then R7 represents nitro or when A represents CR7 then R3 and R7 together represents the groupEMI15.3 may be prepared by heating the diamine VII in which R5 represents hydrogen with a compound of formula IX or X EMI15.4 in which R3 is the group R3 or a group convertible thereto, andP and P are leaving groups. Examples of the leaving group P are halogen e.g. bromine and P are nitroamino and alkylthio e.g. methylthio. The reaction may be carried out iri the absence or presence of a solvent such as acetonitrile, water or an alcohol e.g. ethanol at for example 80 1500C, and optionally in a sealed vessel. In a particular embodiment of the process, triazoles in which R7 is NO2, i.e q is zero and R6 is NO2, may be prepared by heating a diamine of formula VII with a triazole of formula IX in which R7 is NO2. Compounds of formula IX in which A is N andB is CR7 or in which A is CR7 and B is N and P is bromine may be prepared from the corresponding triazole IX in which P is hydrogen by treatment with bromine.Compounds of formula IX in which A and B are both N are either known compounds or may be prepared by methods analogous to those described in British Patent SpecificationNo. 1364917 and G.B. Barlin, J. Chem. Soc. B 1967, 641. Compounds of formula I where Z representsEMI16.1 and R5 represents hydrogen, may he made by reacting an amine of the formula XI R26NH2 XI with a compound of general formula XII EMI16.2 wherein one of the groups R26 and R27 represents the groupEMI16.3 and the other represehts the group R81 , and L is a leaving group such as halogen, thioalkyl preferably thiomethyl or alkoxy. Compounds of formula XII may be prepared by reacting the amine XI with a compound nf formula XIII EMI16.4 where L is as defined in formula XII . The above reaction may be effected in the absence or presence of a solvent e.g ethanol or water at a temperature from ambient to reflux preferably at room temperature. In the absence of a solvent the reaction may be carried out by heating a mixture of the reactants at for example 100 120 C. Compounds of formula I in which R5 represents hydrogen, A represents N and B represents CR7 or A represents CR7 and B represents N, where R7 is the group CH2 qR6 where R6 is NR10COR13, NR10SO2R12,CH2NHC X NHR9 or N CR15R16 may be prepared by treating an aminoalkyltriazole of formula XIV ,EMI17.1 in which R1, R2 and R3 are as defined in formula I or are groups readily convertible thereto, A representsN and B represents CR28 or A represents CR28 and B represents N, where R28 is the group CH2 qNHR10, the group CH2 q 1NH2 or the group CH2 qNH2, with a compound capable of replacing the hydrogen atom in the group NHR10 by the group COR13 or SO2R12 or a HYDROGEN atom in the group NH2 of the group CH2 q11NH2 by the group C X NHR9 or both hydrogen atoms in the groupNH2 of the group CH2 qNH2 by the group CR15R16. Thus for example the aminoalkylthiazole XIV in which R28 is the group CH2 qNHR10 may be reacted with an isocyanate R14 NCO in which R14 has any of the meanings defined for R14 in formula I except hydrogen or represents an alkali metal atcm such as potassium or sodium, or with an activated derivative of either a carboxylic acid R13COOH in Which R13 is other than the group NHR14 or a sulphonic acid R,2SO3H to give a compound of formula I in which R6 is respectively the group NR10CONHR14, NR10COR13 in which R13 is other thanNHR14 , or NR10SO2R12 Suitable activated derivatives include acid halides e.g. acid chlorides, alkylchloroformates, acid anhydrides including mixed anhydrides e.g. acetic formic anhydride , esters such as alkyl esters, ortho esters and tl alkyl 2 pyridinyl esters. The reaction with an acid halide is preferably carried out in the presence of a base e.g an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide or an organic base such as triethylamine or pyridine. The redaction with an alkylchloroformate is preferably carried out in the presence of a base, e.g. potassium carbonate or triethylamine, in a solvent such as dimethylformamide. The reaction with an acid anhydride may be carried out in the absence or presence of solvent such as pyridine. In the reaction with an isocyanate, compounds of formula I in which R14 is other than hydrogen are conveniently prepared by carrying out the reaction in a solvent such as acetonitrile at temperatures from ambient to reflux. Compounds of formula I in which R14 is hydrogen may be prepared by heating a salt e.g. hydrochloride.of the aminotriazole XIV with an aqueous solution of an appropriate cyanate, e.g. potassium cyanate. As a further embodiment of this process an amino alkyltriazole XIV in which R28 is the group CH q lNH2 may be treated with a compound of forms LC X NHR9 where L1 is a leaving group e.g. methylthio to give a compound of formula I in which R6 is CH2NHC X NHR9.The reactants may for example be mixed in an aqueous solution at room temperature. In yet another embodiment of this process an aminoalkyltriazole XIV in which R28 is the group CH2 qNH2 is treated with an appropriate aromatic aldehyde, e.g. benzaldehyde, or a ketone R15R16CO to give a product in which R6 is N CR15R16. The reaction may conveniently be carried out in.the presence of a solvent e.g. benzene, preferably with heating e.g. at reflux. Compounds of formula I in which R5 is hydrogen and R7 is the group CH2 qR6 in which R6 is COR20 whereR20 is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl or aralkyl , or S02R17 may be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding compound in which R7 is the group CH2 qCHR20OH, CH2 qSR17 whereR17 is other than hydroxy or CH2 SH. Thus aldehydes and ketones of formula I in whichR5 is hydrogen and R7 is the group CH2 qCOR20 where R20 is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl or aralkyl may be prepared by oxidising the corresponding hydroxyalkyl compound in whichR7 is CH2 qCHR20OH using for example oxalyl chloride and dimethylsulphoxyde, or activ ated manganese dioxide in a solvent such as dichloromethane. Compounds of formula I in which R5 is hydrogen and R7 is the group CH2 qSO2R17 may be prepared by oxidising the corresponding compound in which R7 is either CH2 qSR17 where R17 is other than hydroxy or CH2 qSH with for example peracetic acid. The reaction may be carried out in a. solvent such as acetic acid, at room temperature. The starting material in which R, is CH2 qSH where q is other than zero may be obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of the corresponding isothiourea, which may in turn be prepared by alkylating thio with an appropriate compound of formula I in ch R6 is a leaving group e.g. halo. The thiol starting material in which R7 is SH may be prepared by diazotisation of the corresponding aminotriazole followed by treatment with an alkali metal e.g. potassium salt of ethyl xanthate to give a xanthate in which R7 is the group SC S OEt, which is subsequently hydrolysed for example by heating with ethanol potassium hydroxide to give the starting thiol in which R7 is the group SH. The above oxidation process is particularly applicable to the preparation of compounds of formula I in which there is no unsaturation within the groupsR1 and R3. Compounds of formula I in which R5 is hydrogen and R7 is CH2 qCR23 NR24 may be prepared by reacting the corresponding carbonyl compound i.e. compound of formula I in which R7 is CH2 qCOR23, with an appropri ate reagent H2NR in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, 24 optionally with heating. Compounds of formula I in which R5 is hydrogen, R7 is CH R where R6 is SO2NR18Rl9 or CONR21R22 may be prepared by reacting an activated derivative of the corresponding carboxylic acid or sulphonic acid, i.e. compounds of formula I in which R7 is CH2 qR6 where R6 is CO2H or SO3H, with ammonia or an appropriate amine HNR18Rl9 or HNR21R22 Suitable activated derivatives include those referred to previously e.g. acid chlorides and esters. Compounds of formula I in which R7 is an acyloxyalkyl group and or R5 is acyl may be prepared by treating the corresponding compound of formula I in which R7 is a hydroxyalkyl group and or R5 represents hydrogen with either an appropriate aciz or an activated derivative thereof e g. an acid anhydride or acid chloride . The reaction may be carried t at room temperature optionally in the presence of a solvent e.g. pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, acetone or dimethylformamide , and preferably in the presence of a base e.g. pyridine, triethylamine or an alkali metal carbonate such as potassium carbonate . Compounds of formula I in which R5 is hydrogen and A is CR7 and B is N, and R3 and R7 together represent CH2 4 may be prepared by reduction of the corresponding compound in which R3 and R7 together represent fCH CHt2 using for example hydrogen and a metal catalyst e.g.platinum in a solvent such as ethanol. Compound s of formula I in which Z isEMI21.1 Alk is CH2 and R5 is hydrogen may be prepared by treating an aldehyde of formula XV EMI21.2 with an amine R1R2NH in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or an alkanol, e.g. methanol, followed by reduction using for example a hydride reducing agent such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal borohydride e.g. sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride , or hydrogen and a metal catalyst such as palladium or platinum.The reactions may be carried out at a temperature of 0 to 300C. The intermediates of formula X1 may be prepared from compounds of formula XVIa EMI21.3 in which W represents a protected aldehtrle group, e.g.a cyclic acetal such as an ethylene acetl, by methods analogous to those described herein for r eparing compounds of formula I from the amine of formula VII . Compounds of formula I in which R5 is hydrogen and R6 is tetrahydropyranyloxy may be prepared by reacting the corresponding hydroxyalkyltriazole of formula I with dihydropyran. The reaction maybe carried out in a solvent, e.g. dichloromethane or dimethylformamide, at low temperature e.g. 100 to 0 C, in the presence df a catalyst, e.g. paratoluenesulphonic acid. In the above discussion of the processes available for the production of compounds according to the invention reference has been made to the primary amines of formula VII . These amines are novel compounds and the invention includes such compounds. These intermediates may be made by a number of processes which are described below. Diamines of formula VII in which R5 is. hydrogen and n is 1 may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula XVII R1R2NAlkQOH XVII with an epoxide of formula XVIII EMI22.1 to produce a diamine of formula XIX EMI22.2 The reaction may be carried out in the absence or Presence of a solvent such as dimethylformamide, preferably at elevated temperature, and optionally in the presence of a base, e.g. sodium hydride or potassium butoxide. The protecting group may be removed from the compound of formula XIX by reaction with a hydrazine, e.g. hydrazine hydrate, or a primary amine, e.g. methylamine. Diamines of formula VII in which R5 is hydrogen and m is 1 may be prepared by reacting an epoxide of formula XX EMI23.1 with an azide, e.g. sodium azide to produce a compound of formula XXI EMI23.2 which may be reduced to produce a diamine of formula VII where m is 1. The reaction with the azide may be carried out in a suitable solvent, e.g. aqueous ethanol in the presence of ammonium chloride, preferably at reflux temperature. Reduction of the compound of formula XXI may be carried out for example, with lithium aluminium hydride in a suitable solvent, e.g.tetrahydrofuran, or catalytically using for example platinum oxide or palladium oxide as catalyst. Diamines of formula VII in which R5 is hdyrogen and m is 2 may be prepared by reacting the epoxide of formula XX with a cyanide, e.g. sodir cyanide, to produce a compound of formula XXII EMI23.3 which may be reduced produce a compound cf formula VII in which m is 2. The reaction wir,i the cyanide may be carried out in a suitable solvent, e.g. aqueous ethanol preferably at reflux temperature. Reduction of the compound of formula XXII may be carried out, for example with lithium aluminium hydride in a suitable solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran. Alternatively the epoxide of formula XX may be reacted with nitromethane to produce a compound of formula XXIII EMI24.1 which may be reduced to produce a compound of formula VII in which m is 2.The reaction with nitromethane may be carried out in a suitable solvent, e.g. dimethyl formamide, preferably in the presence of a base, e.g.sodium hydride. Reduction of the compound of formula XXIII may be carried out for example as described above for reduction of the compound of formula XXII or using hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. The intermediate oxides of formula XX may be prepared by alkylation of an appropriate alkali metal phenolate, e.g. sodium phenolate with a halohydrin X, IV EMI24.2 The intermediate epoxide of formula XVIII may b prepared by alkylation of an alkali metal, phthalimide, e.g. potassium phthalimide with a halohydrin XXV EMI24.3 Where the pro ict of any of title cve processes is a ree base and a alt is required, the salt may be formed in conventional manner.Thus, for example, a generally convenient method of forming the salts is to mix appropriate quantities of the free base and the acid in an appropriate solvent s e.g. an a1 iol such as or an ester such as ethyl aceto The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples.

Injections w v Active ingredient 0.5 Water for injection B.P. to 100.0 Sodium chloride may be added to adjust the tonicity of the solution and the pH may be adjusted to that of maximum stability using dilute acid or alkali or by the addition of suitable buffer salts. The solution is prepared, clarified and filled into appropriate sized ampoules sealed by fusion of the glass. The injection is sterilised by heating in an autoclave using one of the acceptable cycles. Alternatively the solution may be sterilised by filtration and filled in sterile ampoules under aseptic conditions. The solution may be packed nder an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or other suitable gas. The ability of the compounds to inhibit histamine induced gastric acid secretion was demonstrated in the perfused rat stomach test preferred to above For example the compounds of Examples 1 to 9 a have ED50 values within the range of 0,05 0,74 mg kg in the perfused rat stomach test. The compounds of the invention have in general low toxicity at doses at which they effectively inhibit gastric acid secretion. Thus for example the compound of Example 4 produced no toxic effects when administered intravenously to anaesthetised rats at a dose of at least 4 times its ED50 value.
