# Method for making a high performance transistor integrated circuit and the resulting integrated circuit.

## Abstract
A high performance NPN bipolar transistor functioning in a current switch logic circuit is formed within an isolated region of a monocrystalline silicon body 10 wherein the transistor includes an N subcollector 12 , an N collector reach through 20 which connects the subcollector to a major surface of the silicon body, a P base region 22 above the subcollector and adjacent to the reach through region, an N emitter region 30 within the base region and extending from the major surface. The base region 22 includes intrinsic base region located below the emitter region 30 and an extrinsic region 34 located extending from the major surface and adjacent to the emitter region. The extrinsic base preferably completely surrounds or rings the emitter region. Using a mask 32 with openings 24 only in the areas of the extrinsic base regions a P type region 34 is formed by ion implanting with a P type dopant to a depth of less than the depth of the N emitter region 30 followed by a short thermal anneal to activate the P dopant. By the independent control of the intrinsic and extrinsic base resistances the performance of bipolar transistor integrated circuits for current switch logic applications is substantially increased.
