# Priming means for liquid ink writing apparatus.

## Abstract
A system for priming liquid ink writing instruments such as ink jet writers and capillary ink pens is disclosed. A source of ink 12 is pressurized to force ink through the ink jet or other pen 10 so that a small droplet is formed at the jet or pen outlet. As the drop forms at the jet or pen 10 , it is eventually drawn away into an adjacent orifice in a collector ring 30 by capillary action. An integrated priming pump 26 serves both to pressurize the ink source 12 to form the ink droplet, and to apply a vacuum to a collector bottle 32 which is coupled via a flow control element 38 to the orifice to remove the ink drawn away into collector ring 30 by capillary action. The priming pump 26 includes a pressure relief valve to ensure that the ink jet or pen is not overpressurized during priming. In ink jet writer applications, the drop removal orifice is formed as a portion of the droplet charging ring.
