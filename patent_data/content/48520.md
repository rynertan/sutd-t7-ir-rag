## Description
Short title Method and device for drying and grading according to grain size a powdery or granular raw material to prepare a powdery or granular substance substance The invention relates to a method of drying and grading according to grain size a powdery and or granular raw material for preparing a powdery or granular substance and to Ã…a device for carrying out said method. In a known method of the kind set forth separation may be carried out by sieving by means of a mesh screen or in an air flow after drying. This method requires two consecutive operations, each of which requires its own equipment and consumes comparatively much energy. In a further, known method in which the powdery or granular substance is used as a filler, for example, for road constructions, the moist raw material is mixed with moist lime marl to be ground after drying, the mixture being dried and subsequently ground so that the raw material with all its impurities is ground which has a highly detrimental effect on the properties of the raw material. The invention has for its object to obviate the disadvantages of the prior art and provides to this end a method of the kind mentioned in the preamble in which the raw material is passed through a hot gas stream and graded by a gas stream. It is preferred to use a method in which the same gas stream is employed for drying and grading. For constructing asphalt roads amongst other filler containing material is used.This filler has to satisfy the requirements imposed by the public works ministry with respect to road construction materials. These requirements for fillers, as far as being relevant in the scope of this invention are as follows 1 the filler for asphalt mixtures should consist of a homogeneous powder obtained, as the case may be, by mixing two or more constituents 2 the filler should be free of lumps and must not contain parts exceeding 2 mms or foreign ingredients 3 the loss of weight by heating to 1509C may at the most be 1.5 by weight, which means that at any rate the filling substance must be dry 4 the bitumen absorption capacity, to be termed strength of the filler hereinafter in the case of very weak filler , weak filler and medium filler has to satisfy the relevant requirements according to which the absorption capacity for medium filler is higher than for weak filler and again higher for weak filler than for very weak filler.The filler is termed stronger the higher is the bitumen absorption capacity.The filler termed strong stronger than medium filler has vanished from the set of requirements of the public works ministry for construction material, probably because this strong filler is only used for preparing medium filler by mixing with weak or very weak filler. It is therefore sufficient to impose the requirements for medium filler. A very satisfactorily usable and adequately obtainable filling substance is fly ash which contains a sufficient amount of combustible constituents to bind more, preferably much more bitumen than is prescribed for medium filler. It has been found that there is an intimate correlation between the amount of combustible constituents of fly ash and the capacity of binding bitumen. As a result of the improved firing techniques the amount of combustible constituents of fly ash of all fly ash producing industries has decreased to an extent such that modern fly ash is no longer suitable for preparing medium filler by mixing it as a strong filler with a weak filler. However, in the past large quantities of fly ash have been stored, for example, in pits, which contain sufficient amounts of combustible constituents to be suitable for preparing medium filler. However, this fly ash is wet and has, therefore, to be dried. Moreover, the fly ash contains many impurities, for example lumps, earth, stones, pieces of metal, glass, ceramic, larger ash particles and so on. The invention is particularly directed to a method of preparing a filler for road construction material, in which moist fly ash is used as a raw material in accordance with the invention. In one embodiment a device according to the invention is characterized by 1 a horizontal or sloping, rotatable drum communicating at one end with a bunker for the raw material and at the other being provided with means for delivering at least part thereof 2 a device for heating the raw material and 3 a separator connected with the drum and operating by a gas stream.It is preferred to use a variant in which the drum is at the same time the separator and which comprises a device for passing a gas stream through the drum. In this case. one end of the drum may be connected with a suction duct including at least one cyclone. Moreover, a burner may be disposed in the air feed. Further features and particularities of the invention will be mentioned and explained with reference to the accompanying drawing. The drawing shows an elevational view, partly broken away, of a device embodying the invention. This device according to the invention comprises various parts to be mentioned hereinbelow. A bunker 1 for moist fly ash and an inclined rotatably drivable drum 2 adjoining at its higher end i.e. on the left hand side in the drawing through a supply tube 3 the bunker 1 are provided. Near the outlet opening of the bunker 1 is provided a spring loaded flap 16 preventing random suction of raw material. The supply tube 3 opens out in the drum 2 in the region of its open end. The other end of the drum is also largely open and has a plurality of spokes 4. The spokes 4 are connected at one end with the jacket of the drum and at the other end with a ring 5, through which a burner 6 opens out in the interior of the drum. The spokes 4 are furthermore rigidly coupled with a coaxial sleeve 7, which serves to hold by a bearing 8 a tube 9 of the rotatable drum 12. The sleeve has furthermore a toothed crown 10, which serves for rotatably driving the drum 2 by means of a motor 11. The higher open end of the drum 2 is carried by supporting rollers 12. The housing 9 adjoins in substantially sealing relationship a suction duct 13, through the wall of which is passed the supply tube 3. In the suction duct 13 is included a cyclone 14 for removing the smaller particles, as well as a suction ventilator 15. The inner wall of the drum 2 is provided with at least substantially radially extending blades 17. The device shown in the drawing operates as follows The motor 11 rotatably drives the drum 2. The burner 6 is operating the suction ventilator 15 produces a continual gas stream through the drum. Through the sprin loaded flap 16 moist fly ash is admitted through the supply tube 3 into the drum 2. Owing to the presence of hot gases in the drum 2 by the action of the burner 6 the moist fly ash is dried, but it is in a partly fluidized, partly floating state dependent upon the grain size. The lighter particles i.e. having a smaller grain size are conducted away through the suction duct 13, whereas the heavier particles are gradually conveyed downwards via the rotating drum wall and finally they are transferred along the spokes 4 to a conveyor belt 18 through a coarse particle outlet 19 having a swinging flap 22 in the housing 9.The finer fly ash particles sucked away through the duct 13 are collected by the cyclone and can be periodically removed by actuating a flap 20 through a fine particle outlet 21. It will be obvious that in the present embodiment in which the fly ash is dried and graded according to grain size the useful smaller particles can be collected from the outlet opening 21. By manipulating the suction force of the suction ventilator 15 grading according to grain size can be adjusted to a desired value, for example, to a grain size of about 2 mms. The invention is not limited to the embodiment described above. For example, the burner may be disposed at a different place in the air supply and instead of using a suction ventilator there may be employed a blowing ventilator on the other side of the system. As a matter of course, the application of the invention is not limited to fly ash. The invention encompasses also an embodiment in which the heavier particles at the opening 19 constitute the main constituent.
