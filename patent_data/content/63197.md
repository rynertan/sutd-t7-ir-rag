# Method and composition for treating aqueous mediums.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method and a composition for controlling the deposition of scale imparting precipitates on structural parts of a system exposed to an aqueous medium containing scale imparting precipitates, under scale impart ing conditions, are disclosed. Specifically, these precipitates are either calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, calcium phos phate or mixtures thereof. The method and composition are also efficacious in dispersing inorganic and organic matter, which may exist within a cooling system, boiler system, or the like. The composition comprises an acrylic acid lower alkyl hydroxylated acrylate copolymer 1 which is adminis tered to the system in combination with an ester of an aliphatic sulphodicarboxylic acid II . Preferred esters include the dioctylester of sodium sulphosuccinic acid, the diisobutylester of sodium sulphosuccinic acid, the dihexyles ter of sodium sulphosuccinic acid. The method comprises administering an effective amount of the compounds I and II to the aqueous system to be treated.
