## Description
GRATE WITH INCORPORATED ALARM SYSTEMThe present invention realizes a metal grate, usually made of steel, which contains a series of incorporated devices, which, in the case of tampering, will activate the alarm system which is connected to them.One is reminded that grates usually built of steel and in different shapes are barriers which are secured in the openings of the walls, such as windows, or transition areas between one room and the next, in order to permanently prevent people from entering into reserved or forbidden rooms, or, as in the case of jails, in order to prevent escapes through the openings which are protected by these grates.The grates are firmly secured in the walls by means of cementing or by means of similar systems and they constitute in themselves a barrier of the passive type, that is, they oppose their structure and their type of anchorage to possible tamperings or to attempted force.On the contrary, the present invention realizes a grate, which, besides being a barrier of the passive type, is also an active means which prevents, because of its constitution, any type of tampering, whether represented by the cutting of the bars, which constitute it, by their being forced apart, or by the tearing of the grate away from the anchoring wall.This goal is achieved by the realization of a grate, constituted by tubes or by structural shapes, made of steel or of similar material, which are hollow inside and in which is located a network of electrical wires with a significant electrical resistance, forming one or more circuits, which are connected to an alarm station through the interposition of an appropriate balancing circuit, which intercepts any resistance variation occurring in the circuit. In actuality one. or more pairs of highly resistant, insulated electrical wires are introduced into the hollow structure of the grate and they are even made to go through several times along all the longitudinal and the transversal sections of the grate itself, including the anchorage sections which secure the grate to the wall or to the frame supporting the grate.Each pair of wires is electrically connected on one side with an endof the line resistance, which is located, for example, in an anchorage and, on the other side, with a balancing electronic circuit which, as has been said, intercepts any variation of resistance in the circuit. Therefore, whenever there is a tampering in any point of the grate which may consist in the sawing of the bars, in the drilling, in the flame cutting, in the tearing from the wall or from the anchoring frame, in the forcing apart a variation of resistance occurs, which may be due, for example, to a short cir cuit or an interruption of the circuit this variation, intercepted by a balancing circuit of the resistance,which is applied to it, will cause in the circuit itself the opening of a relay which is connected to the burglaralarm station and, therefore, will activate the alarm.In order to increase the reliability of the functioning of the grate circuits, it was deemed advisable to introduce into it at least two circuits, one independent from the other, with equivalent functions and based on the same functional principle and on the same construction method. Particular attention has been paid to the solution of the problem concerning the tearing of the grate, that is, to the complete removal of the same from the anchoring wall or frame. For this reason at least one pair of anchorages and a pivot, preferably in a diagonal position, which goes completely through the wall and is anchored by means of an iron loop or cross on the other side of the grate, have been introduced.The head of this pivot is provided with a loop, through which the wires of the electrical circuit or circuits are strung, so that a possible removal from the wall of the anchorage in which the pivot is inserted will also cause the tearing of the elecrical circuit, with the ensuing activation of the alarm.Another interesting aspect of the grate being discussed is that, because of the way in which it activates the alarm, false alarms due to accidental causes are practically impossible in fact, if there is no alteration of the electrical circuit in the grate, caused by the above described causes, there will be no alarm.These and other characteristics and construction details will be better illustrated in the description of a preferred form of execution of the grate, which is given by way of indication, but which is not limiting and which is illustrated in the enclosed drawings, in which pict. 1 shows the grate strung with the electrical circuits pict. 2 shows the anchorage, in which there is the entrance of the wires of the electrical circuits introduced in the grate pict. 3 illustrates the anti tear system of the anchorage with a pivot provided with a loop pict. 4 shows the type of anchorage in which the wires of the circuit are wound once, in order to continue toward other areas pict. 5 shows an anchorage containing the end of the line resistance of one of the circuits pict. 6 sketches with a circuit in blocks the connection of the grate circuits with the alarm station.With reference to pict. 1, grate 1 is built of structural shapes made of steel, soldered and hollow inside, so as to allow the passage of two pairs of elctrical wires 2, 3 and 4, 5, each of which constitutes a closed circuit on a resistance, as shown in 6.Pict. 1 shows the route of the wires, which can be strung in iny direction, even going through the same section several times, although it should be kept in mind, that no area, including the anchorages, should be left without wiring.In the case under examination there are 4 anchorages and each of them con tains circuit structures and characteristics, which are different from one another.With reference to anchorage 7, pict. 2, tube 8, made of plastic material, is placed inside of it this tube goes all the way through the wall and serves as a channel for the introduction in the grate of the conductors connected to the alarm station. It is blocked inside anchorage 7 by block 9, made of a gummy plastic material, which contrasts with the inside walls of the above mentioned anchorage.In pict. 3, anchorage 10 holds inside pivot 11, made of iron, which goes all the way through the wall and which presents its threaded end 12 protruding from the anchorage. Plate type 13 is screwed to protruding end 12 and then cemented in the wall. Pivot 11 is provided at the other end with loop 14, through which the electric conductors are strung. Two bolts, 15 and 16, prevent the rotation of pivot 11 while plate 13 is being screwed. The anti tear function of the pivot is obvious in fact, in the case of an attempt to tear anchorage 10 from the wall, one also tears the conductors which are strung through the loop.In pict. 4, inside anchorage 17, there is a block 18, made of plastic material which allows conductors 2, 3 and 4, 5 to wind around and continue to spread themselves in the horizontal and vertical sections of the grate. In pict. 5, the inside of anchorage 19 also holds asiXock, made of plastic material,for the reversing of the direction of the circuit wires, but inside it there is also the load resistance of one of the two circuits. Conductors 2, 3 and 4, 5 are normal, insulated electric conductors, but with a very small section, so that, because of their length, they constitute in themselves a resistive load, in addition to the load resistance. Each circuit is fed with low tension 12 Volts , so that possible contacts between the grate and the conductors may not be dangerous to people.Pict. 6 is a sketch of the circuit in blocks which connects the conductors contained in the grate to the alarm station. Resistances R1 and R2 represent respectively the resistive load of the two circuits 2, 3 and 4,5. Each of the two resistances is connected with a balancing circuit of a known type, which includes trimmer 20, which has the task of balancing the connected load resistance, so that a transistorized circuit maintains relay 21 normally closed. Each variation of the value of resistance R1 or R2 is felt by the balancing circuit which, consequently, causes the opening of relay 21, which is connected to alarm station 22. The electric opening of relay 21 will cause the activation of the alarm. In the specific case being described, two circuits have been foreseen. They are introduced into the grate, are independent from one another and are represented by resistances R1 and R2, but it is obvious that a single circuit is sufficient for the functioning of the alarm system on the other hand, it is also possible, for security reasons, to increase the number of circuits beyond 2.
