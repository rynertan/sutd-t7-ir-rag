## Description
XANTHANASE ENZYME AND ITS PRODUCTION This invention relates to a process for the microbial production of an enzyme which depolymerises xanthan gum, the enzyme thereby produced and the application of that enzyme in the depolymerisation of xanthan gum. Xanthan gum, and other polysaccharides such as carboxymethyl cellulose and tragacanth are used in a variety of commercial applications, for example xanthan gum is used in the commercial extraction of oil where they may be used to increase the viscosity of drilling muds and secondary extraction fluids. However, the increased viscosity can often make subsequent processing more difficult, and it would therefore be advantageous if, after use, the xanthan or other polysaccharide could be depolymerised, thereby reducing its viscosity. The Applicants have now discovered that such a depolymerisation can be achieved by a new enzyme produced by a novel strain of Corynebacterium. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of a xanthan gum depolymerising enzyme hereinafter termed xanthanase1, which comprises culturing Corynebacterium strain 20 122 deposited with NCIB under accession number 11535 under aerobic conditions in a liquid growth medium comprising assimilable sources of nitrogen and essential mineral salts and, as the sole carbon source, xanthan gum, separating the bacterial cells from the reaction mass and recovering the xanthanase from the resultant spent growth medium. The Corynebacterium 20 122 was isolated by inoculating with soil samples a series of sterile liquid enrichment culture media having the composition shown in Table I below TABLE I Component Concentration l 1 Xanthan 1.0 g Na2HPOh 3.0 g KX2P04 3.0 g NH4 2SO4 0.3 g MgSO.7H20 0.2 g FeCI3. 6H 0 16.7 mg 2 CaCl2.2H2O . 2H20 0.66 mg Znso.7H2o 0.18 mg CuS0.5H20 0.16 mg MnS04. 4X20 0.15 mg CoCl2. 6H2O 0.18 mg H3303 0.10 mg Na2MoO.2H20 0.30 mg If the complete medium was sterilised by autoclaving, degradation of the xanthan gum occurred, as judged by loss of viscosity.Thus, in practice separate solutions of the xanthan and of the salts, made up at double the final strength, were autoclaved separately and equal volumes of the sterile solutions mixed to give the complete medium. The xanthan solution was autoclaved at 100 C for 25 minutes and the salts solution at 1100C for 25 minutes. Inoculated growth medium was incubated at 30 C on a rotary shaker until the medium had lost its viscosity and microbial growth was apparent. The bacterium was isolated and purified from this culture using conventional microbiological techniques by streaking onto agar plates containing the same medium solidified with 1.2 o agar. In practice, it was found that even the modified procedure adopted to autoclave the enrichment medium for the inoculum was not sufficient to guarantee sterility. Consequently, in order to prevent contaminated cultures, a streptomycin resistant mutant of the initially isolated organism was obtained by streaking that organism onto agar plates of the above medium containing 100 sg ml of streptomycin sulphate. One of the resulting organisms that grew on these plates was designated Corynebacterium 20 122, and has been deposited with NCIB under accession number 11535.All further work was carried out with this mutant strain and streptomycin sulphate at 100 g ml was always included in the growth medium. The antibiotic was included with the xanthan solution during the autoclaving procedure. Corynebacterium 20 122 has the characteristics shown in TableII below. These were determined by standard test methods described in Cowan and Steel s Manual for the Identification of MedicalBacteria second edition 1974 . Comparison of these characteristics with those listed in Bergy s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology,Eighth Edition reveals that the organism belongs to the genusCorynebacterium but insufficient data are available to ascribe it to a particular species hence the designation, Corynebacterium 20 122.

The liquid growth medium used in the process of the invention comprises a nitrogen containing compound which may, for example, be ammonia, urea, an ammonium salt such as a sulphate or chloride, or a nitrate, for example an alkali metal nitrate. The compound is suitably present in a concentration from 1 50 g l. Other elements which should desirably be present in the medium are phosphorus, sulphur, magnesium and iron. The phosphorus source is preferably one or more phosphates, for example K2HP04, KH2P04, Na2HP04 or NH 2HPO4, or phosphoric acid, preferably present in a concentration from 1 20 g l. The sulphur source may be sulphuric acid or a sulphate such as NH4 2 SO4 suitably in a concentration from 0.1 5.0 g l. The two metals are provided as one of their salts, for example MgSO4.7H20 in a concentration from 0.1 2.0 g l and FeC13.6H2O in a concentration from 5 50 mg l. The medium may also contain trace amounts of other elements in the form of suitable salts, for example calcium, manganese, zinc, cobalt, molybdenum and boron. The incubation of the inoculated culture is conveniently carried out by shaking under temperature and pH conditions controlled to produce the desired xanthanase with maximum yield, namely at a temperature between 250 400C, preferably 300, and a pH between 5 and 8, preferably between 6.0 and 7.0. The incubation was continued until the protein concentration in the growth medium had reached a maximum, which normally was achieved after 40 48 hours. The bacterial cells were then removed, suitably by centrifugation, and the xanthanase recovered from the spent growth medium, suitably by precipation with, for example, ammonium sulphate or ethanol.The precipitate could then be redissolved in a small volume of water suitably 100 ml of water per litre of original culture and residual precipitating agent removed by dialysis against distilled water, followed by final concentration by freeze drying. Alternatively, the xanthanase could be recovered by freeze drying the spent growth medium from which the cells had been removed. The invention includes also the xanthanase enzyme produced by the foregoing process, which enzyme has been characterised by the reaction products derived from the enzymic depolymerisation of deacetylated xanthan gum. There are 4 major products, which have Rf values of 0.55, 0.50, 0.14 and 0.05 when resolved by chromatography on cellulose thin layer plates using, as solvent, ethyl acetate pyridine glacial acetic acid water 5 5 1 3 by volume , and detected with standard silver nitrate sodium hydroxide spray reagent.The four products were further identified by sugar analysis as being, in order of decreasing Rf value, mannose, mannose ketal linked to pyruvate, an oligosaccharide containing glucose, mannose and uronic acid in the proportions 1.0 0.5 0.34 respectively, and an oligosaccharide containing glucose, mannose and uronic acid in the proportions 1.0 0.84 0.55. The invention further includes a process for the depolymerisation of xanthan gum or carboxymethyl cellulose CMC , in which an aqueous solution of the gum or OMO is reacted with the xanthanase produced as defined above at a temperature between 250C and 7000, preferably 300C, and a pE between 5 and 7, preferably pH 5.6. The invention is further illustrated in the following Examples.Example 1 Corynebacterium 20 122 was inoculated into 200 ml of medium contained in a 1 1 flask. The medium was as defined in Table 1 above, with the addition of 100 rg ml streptomycin sulphate, and had a pH of 6.8. The inoculated medium was incubated at 300C on a reciprocating shaker, and growth of the bacteria was monitored by optical density measurements at 625 nm and by following the decrease in viscosity of 1 ml samples of. the broth in a WellsBrookfield microviscometer. After 48 hours the concentration of xanthanase enzyme protein in the growth medium had reached its maximum as determined by enzyme activity see below , and the cells then removed by centrifugation and filtration of the clear supernatant through 0.22 P Millipore filters. The xanthanase enzyme was then recovered from the resulting cell free spent growth medium by the addition, with stirring, of solid, recrystallised ammonium sulphate in an amount sufficient to give a final ammonium sulphate concentration of 70 complete saturation. Alternatively, ethanol can be added to give a final concentration of 60 . The precipitate was collected by centrifugation filtration being an alternative procedure , redissolved in a small volume of water approx. 100 ml per litre of original culture , and residual ammonium sulphate or ethanol removed by dialysis against three changes of distilled water at 40C. Final concentration of the xanthanase enzyme was then achieved by freezedrying, to yield a product whose activity could be demonstrated either by following the loss of viscosity over a 10 minute period at 400C of 1 ml samples of a 1 g l solution of xanthan gum In water following addition of 0.1 ml enzyme solution, using a WellsBrookfield LVT microviscometer, or by the release cf reducing sugars over a 10 minute interval at 300C from a mixture containing, enzyme and 1 mg of xanthan gum, in 2 ml of 25 millimolar acetate buffer pH5.6. Reducing sugar was measured by the method ofNelson Journal of Biological Chemistry 153, 375 1944 . The enzyme has been established as being stable for at least 3 months in distilled water at O C. Its activity is optimal at pH5.6, and a temperature of 700C. However, the activity diminishes at elevated temperature over a one hour period, 30 of activity is lost at 300C, 50 lost at 450C, and 100 i.e. total inactivation at 5O0C. Example 2 200 mg of xanthan gum in 200 ml of distilled water were incubated at 30 C with 0.5 mg of the xanthanase enzyme produced according to Example 1 above for a period of 15 hours with shaking.A few drops of chloroform were added to the mixture to prevent microbial growth. Under these conditions the viscosity of the solution as measured with 1 ml samples in a Wells Brookfield microviscometer rapidly decreased, thereby establishing the degradation or depolymerisation of the xanthan gum. Similar experiments carried out with carboxymethyl cellulose established that the xanthanase enzyme was also effective in depolymerising that material, its activity being 22 times greater than its activity with xanthan gum. In the case of other commercial polysaccharide gums such as tragacanth and carrageenan, the enzyme showed a rapid initial activity, but this soon diminished before a significant extent of depolymerisation had been achieved. Example 3 The end products from the xanthan gum depolymerisation described in Example 2 above, and of similar treatment of a deacetylated xanthan gum, were subjected to thin layer chromatography and sugar analysis in order to identify their structure and thence the mode of action of the xanthanase enzyme. The depolymerised end product of Example 2 was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at 400C and the residue dissolved in water. The products of the reaction in this solution were resolved by chromatography on cellulose thin layer plates using, as solvent, ethyl acetate pyridine glacial acetic acid water 5 5 1 3 by volume , being detected on the chromatograms with a silver nitrate sodium hydroxide spray reagent Data for Biochemical Research, Editors R. Dawson, D. Elliott,W. Elliott, K. Jones second edition, Oxford at the ClarendonPress, 1969, p.541 . At least nine reaction products were obtained from xanthan gum using this procedure. However, if the xanthan was first deacetylated by treatment under a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 hours at room temperature with 25 millimolar potassium hydroxide in the presence of 1 potassium chloride, and then depolymerised by the procedure of Example 2, only 4 major sugar containing reaction products were obtained. Several other materials that react with the silver nitrate spray are also seen on the chromatograms but only occurred in small quantities and were not further characterised.The Rf values of the major products in the above thin layer chromatography system were 0.05, 0.14, 0.50 and 0.55. The four products from deacetylated xanthan gum were separated, purified and characterised. Separation was obtained by chromatography on paper as described above and the 4 components were purified by gel permeation and ion exchange chromatography using established procedures. They have been designated P1, P2, P3 and P4 on the basis of increasing Rf values in the above thin layer chromatography system. These four products were then characterised with respect to their constituent sugars. Neutral sugars were determined after hydrolysis of the materials by gas chromatography after conversion to their aldononitrile acetate derivatives. The products 0.5 mg were hydrolysed with 0.25 molar sulphuric acid 0.2 ml at 95 C for 20 hours. The mixture of sugars produced was neutralised with an ion exchange resin Bio Rad AG1 X2, bicarbonate form and evaporated to dryness with a stream of nitrogen. The sugars were converted to the aldononitrile acetates and analysed by gas chromatography as described by R. Varma and R.S. Varma Journal of Chromatography 128, 45 52 1976 . Uronic acids in the purified enzyme reaction products were determined by the carbazole reaction T. Bitter and H.M. Muir 1962 Analytical Biochemistry 4, 330 334 using glucuronic acid as a reference standard. The enzyme product P4 was shown to be mannose by comparison with the authentic sugar by gas chromatography as the aldononitrile acetate in the system mentioned above and by thin layer chromatography on cellulose layers in the following solvents 1. ethyl acetate pyridine glacial acetic acid water 5 5 1 3 by volume .2. propan 2 ol ethyl acetate water 6 1 3 by volume . Detection on the thin layer plates was by silver nitrate sodium hydroxide and gave Rf values of 0.51 and 0.62 respectively. Authentic mannose behaved identically in both t.l.c. systems and by g.l.c. The enzyme product P3 was hydrolysed and the only sugar released was shown to be mannose. When P3 was hydrolysed for 40 minutes at 1000C with 2 molar HC1 and the hydrolysate neutralised to pH7.0 with sodium hydroxide, pyruvic acid was shown to be present. The acid was identified and determined by the use of lactate dehydrogenase as described by Bergmeyer Methods of Enzymatic Analysis 1965 Academic Press, New York London pp. 253 259 . Approximately equimolar amounts of pyruvate and mannose were found in hydrolysates of P3.In view of the determined structure of xanthan gum Jannson,Kenne and Lindberg 1975 Carbohydrate Research 45, 275 282 Melton, Mindt, Rees and Sanderson 1976 Carbohydrate Research 46, 245 257 , the analysis of P3 indicates that it Is derived from the terminal residue of the trisaccharide side chain in which pyruvate is lirsked as a ketal to mannose. P3 may therefore be 4.6 0 l carboxyethylidene mannose. The enzyme product P2 was shown, after hydrolysis, to contain glucose and mannose in the molar ratio 1 0.50. Uronic acid was also detected by the carbazole test, the molar ratio of glucose to uronic acid as glucuronic acid being 1 0.34. However, the absorption spectrum of P2 showed a strong band at 232 nm and P2 also reacted strongly in the thiobarbituric acid test of Weissbai and Hurwltz Journal of Biological Cehmistry, 234, 705 709 1959 indicating that the uronic acid was present as the unsaturated A 4,5 derivative, presumably as unsaturated ss 4,5 glucuronic acid.The previous report that glucuronic acid and its 4,5 unsaturated derivative give the same colour yield in the carbazole test has not been confirmed as no authentic sample of the unsaturated material was available. Hence it is not clear if the molar ratio of glucose to uronic acid in P2 of 1.0 0.34, as determined by the carbazole reaction using glucuronic acid as a standard, is precisely correct. Further information on the structure of P2 was obtained by methylation analysis using the method of Hakomori as described byLindberg Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 28B, pp. 178 195 1972 . Methylat ion analysis involves the replacement of all exposed hydroxyl groups in the oligosaccharide by methoxyl groups. When the modified oligosaccharide is subsequently hydrolysed to its constituent methylated sugars, the newly exposed hydroxyl groups are derived from the breakage of the linkages between the sugar residues.Hence, analysis of the partially methylated sugars to determine the positions of the hydroxyl groups, indicates the positions in the sugar molecules involved in the linkages between sugars in the oligosaccharide. Analysis is carried out by combined gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The results with P2 showed that the methylation procedure resulted in only trimethyl derivatives of sugars, namely 3,4,6 2,4,6 and 2,3,6 trimethyl hexoses. This indicates that P2 is an unbranched oligosaccharide as no dimethyl sugars are formed and that, as expected, the non reducing terminal of the molecule is occupied by the unsaturated uronic acid residue as no tetramethyl derivatives are formed and uronic acid derivatives are not recovered in this procedure . Hence, considering the published structure of xanthan gum, it appears that P2 is a tetrasaccharide having the molecular structure shown in formula I below EMI10.1 This structure would require a glucose mannose uronic acid molar ratio of 1.0 0.5 0.5 as opposed to the 1.0 0.5 0.34 determined. P2 contains no pyruvic acid. The enzyme product P1 was shown after hydrolysis to contain glucose, mannose and uronic acid in the molar ratio 1.00 0.84 0.55 P1 did not react in the thiobarbituric acid test nor did it absorb at 232 nm and therefore does not contain an unsaturated uronic acid. Methylation analysis indicated the formation of the same three trimethyl hexoses as in P2 and, in addition, 2,3,4,6 tetra methyl hexose was obtained. The tetramethyl derivative is derived from the non reducing terminal of the oligosaccharide. Dimethyl sugars were again absent. Hence, P1 is believed to be an unbranched oligosaccharide having the molecular structure shown in formula II below EMI11.1 This structure would require a glucose mannose uronic acid molar ratio of 1.0 1.0 0.50.
