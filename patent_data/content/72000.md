# Motor vehicle diagnostic monitoring system.

## Abstract
A diagnostic monitoring system detects and dis plays a malfunction occured in various engine opera tion control computers 4 which include a microcom puter, actuators and sensors. Each of the engine opera tion control computers performs a diagnosis program as a part of the control programs and produces an ab normal signal when a malfunction is detected. A cen tralized supervisory system 6 receives such abnormal signals from the engine operation control computers and stores separately for individual control computers. A display unit 7 displays the content of the abnormal signal in response to the instruction from the central supervisory system.
