# METHOD AND DEVICE FOR REGISTERING PRINTING PRESS

## Abstract
Disclosed in this specification are 1 a registering method for a printing press comprising the steps for magnify ing a pattern of a printed medium and displaying it on a display device inputting the coordinates of a position of each color pattern for a predetermined element of the magnified and dis played image by coordinate input means determining a regis tration error between respective colors based on the coordi nates of each color position and the magnification of the im age calculating a quantity required for adjustment of the posi tion of a plate cylinder based on said registration error and ef fecting the registering of the printing press depending upon the results of this calculation 2 a device for inputting a pat tern of a printed medium on a printing press, displaying the pattern on enlarged scale on the screen of a display device, in putting the coordinates of the position of each color pattern for a predetermined element within the magnified and displayed image by coordinate input means, determining a registration error between respective colors from the coordinates of the position of each color and the magnification of the image, cal culating a quantity required for the adjustment of the position of a plate cylinder based on said registration error and effect ing the registering of the printing press in response to the re sults of this calculation and 3 a device for displaying a pat tern of a printed medium on enlarged scale on the screen of a display device, inputting the coordinates of the position of each color pattern by a friction input means by utilizing a predetermined element within the magnified and displayed im age and determining a registration error between respective colors from the coordinates of the position of each color and the magnification of the image.
