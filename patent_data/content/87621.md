# Air flow meter for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
The air flowing in through an air cleaner is passed through a main passage and sucked into an internal combustion engine. A part of the air flowing through the main passage 16 flows in a by pass passage 18 . An air flow sensor 20 is provided in the by pass passage. In this case, the length 1 of the bypass passage is substantially three or more times longer than that of a part L of the main passage corresponding thereto. Accordingly, even when the internal combustion engine is operated with a throttle nearly totally open and the air in the main passage is pulsated, the average flow rate in the by pass passage increases owing to the inertial lag effect obtained by lengthening the by pass passage, so that it is possible to prevent the output of the flow sensor from undesirably lowering.
