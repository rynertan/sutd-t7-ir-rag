# Apparatus for emergency cooling of a steam generator of a nuclear power plant.

## Abstract
In apparatus for emergency cooling of a steam generator unit 1 of a nuclear power plant wherein blow off steam is condensed in a closed circuit and the resulting condensate is returned to the steam generator as feed water, the steam is passed through a blow off pipe 11 into a closed vessel 14 comprising a water space 12 and a gas space 13 . A bundle of heat exchanger tubes 15 extends through the vessel 14 . An end part of the blow off pipe 11 extending into the water space 12 is angularly bent and is designed as a steam distributor nozzle 18 which is arranged opposite to the bundle of heat exchanger tubes 15 . The thermo syphon effect and hence the efficiency of the apparatus are increased with this arrangement so that the amount of steam blown off can be taken up in a relatively small vessel.
