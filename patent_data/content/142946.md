## Abstract
A fluid pump 1 in which reciprocation of a plunger 6 within a housing 2 causes fluid 8 to be drawn through an internal passage 7 in the plunger 6 towards an outlet 4 , and at the same time causes fluid to pass between the outside of the plunger and the inside of the housing to be dispersed from said outlet and or to lubricate and provide a seal between the plunger 6 and the housing 2 .
