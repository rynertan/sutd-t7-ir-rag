# Surface acoustic wave device.

## Abstract
A withdrawal transducer structure is employed in a nar row band surface acoustic wave device requiring many pairs of interdigital transducer fingers 1a 1c, 2a 2c or in a high frequency surface acoustic wave device in which the thickness of interdigital transducer fingers is large relative to the wave length L of the surtace acoustic wave, so that the interdigital transducer fingers may not severely adversely affect the char acteristics of the device. The interdigital transducer fingers in the input and output piezoelectric transducers are suitably partly withdrawn to leave some of them 13a 13b, 14a 14b or dummy fingers 11a 11d are additionally provided to eliminate the adverse effect of the interdigital transducer fingers on the characteristics of the device, so that the narrow band or high frequency surface acoustic wave device can operate with im proved performance without making any unnecessary fre quency response.
