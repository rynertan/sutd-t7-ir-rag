## Abstract
A system for use in the treatment of paralyzed muscles is disclosed. The system makes use of a set of transcutaneous electrodes 15a, 15b, 15c which are placed upon the skin of the subject over muscles which are to be stimulated. A computer controlled stimulator 50 generates a pair of alternately pulsed stimulation signals which are applied across different pairs of stimulation electrodes 15a, 15c and 15b, 15c to produce controlled muscle contraction. Muscle movement is resisted by a dynamic load 27 , and a position sensor 17 provides a feedback signal indicating the movement actually achivied. The computer 13 uses the feedback signal for modifying the control signal applied to the stimulator.
