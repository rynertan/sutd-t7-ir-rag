# Liquid spraying devices.

## Abstract
A liquid spraying device comprises a nozzle 2 formed with an outlet orifice 10 through which the water exits as a jet flowing parallel to the axis of the nozzle 2 , a cup member 12 supported close to and overlying the outlet orifice 10 so as to be impinged by the jet and to reflect it back towards the nozzle 2 , and a deflector surface in the path of the reflected back liquid, which deflector surface is formed with at least one channel 40 extending generally radially of the nozzle 2 and effective to deflect the reflected back liquid and to channel it to form at least one jet issuing laterally of the nozzle 2 . Described are a static type device in which the deflector sur face is formed in the face 24 of the nozzle 2 having the outlet orifice 10 , and rotary type devices in which the deflector surface is formed in a rotor mounted between the cup member and the face of the nozzle having the outlet orifice.
