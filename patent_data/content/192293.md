# Cathode ray tube provided with a luminescent indium orthoborate.

## Abstract
A cathode ray tube provided with a luminescent screen comprisng a luminescent indium orthoborate activated by trivalent chromium. The tube yields an efficient emission in the near infrared part of the spectrum. If the borate further comprises Eu as an activator, an efficient EuÂ³ emission is obtained in addition to the Cr emission.
