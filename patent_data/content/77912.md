# FET adder circuit.

## Abstract
A digital field effect transistor FET adder circuit is disclosed which employs non DC current configurations to significantly reduce power, device count, and delay in performing binary addition. The circuit features a carry propagate transfer FET device whose gate is controlled by a carry propagate control circuit which selectively gates on the transfer FET device at a particular adder bit stage when the carry in binary bit is to be transferred as the carry out binary bit when the augend input bit and addend input bit at that stage are not equal. The circuit additionally features a carry generate control circuit which is connected to the carry out node of the FET transfer device, which selectively connects that node to either a drain potential when both inputs are unity or to ground potential when both inputs are zero, thereby efficiently generating the carry out bit without regard for the state of the carry in bit. When the input bits are not equal, the carry generate control circuit has a high impedance state so that it will not affect the propagation of the carry in bit through the FET transfer device. A resultant adder circuit has a reduced power dissipation, a reduced signal delay, and a reduced device count when compared with other prior art FET adder circuits.
