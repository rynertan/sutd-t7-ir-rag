# SERVO CONTROLLED SPINDLE DRIVE SYSTEM

## Abstract
An improved spindle drive train for rotatably driving the spindle of a machine tool comprises a frame fastened to which is a motor whose shaft extends into the frame. Keyed on that portion of the motor shaft extending into the frame is a pinion gear which is in meshing engagement with one of the gear members of a cluster gear journaled in the frame for rotation about and transverse movement along an axis parallel to the motor shaft. Journaled into the frame parallel to the cluster gear is the tool carrying spindle which has a shaft extending coaxially therefrom within the frame. The spindle shaft carries a plurality of gear thereon, each dimensioned to meshingly engage a corresponding cluster gear member, and each is aligned with one another so that when the spindle is at a predetermined angular orientation, the teeth on each of the gears line up permitting axial shifting of the cluster gear. The gears on the spindle shaft are spaced apart such that as the cluster gear is biased along its axis, one of the gears on the spindle shaft and its complementary cluster gear member engage just as another gear and its complementary cluster gear member disengage, assuring constant synchronism between the spindle and the motor. Motor shaft position is obtained by a resolver fastened directly to the motor shaft, thereby preventing excessive resolver back lash.
