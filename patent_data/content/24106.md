# Method of heat treating ferrous workpieces.

## Abstract
A method of gas heat treating ferrous materials com prises mixing air in a predetermined proportion with a hyd rocarbon gas such as methane or propane and slowly intro ducing the mixture to a treating chamber which is held at a temperature of 1500 2000 F 816 1093 C , so that the gas atmosphere is similar in composition to an independently generated endothermic gas base atmosphere. The flow through the furnace chamber of the gas atmosphere is con trolled to be low so that preferably the ratio of furnace chamber volume cubic feet to flow rate cubic feet hour is always at least 0.2 hours. This carburizing process can also be run in a mode in which the atmosphere composition is auto matically controlled. In carrying out the process, it is preferred that a constant flow of air be introduced into the furnace chamber and the hydrocarbon flow be regulated to maintain a constant value of furnace atmosphere COâ‚‚ content or oxygen potential.
