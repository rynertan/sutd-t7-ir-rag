# Release and alignment mechanism for jet propelled projectiles.

## Abstract
A projectile release mechanism is disclosed for facilitat ing launching a jet propelled projectile in the form of a spheri cal spin stabilized missile. The mechanism includes a nozzle 48 extending from the projectile 10 , including fusible joint means 54 for heating by high temperature exhaust gases expelled by the projectile to release the projectile. A projectile support includes a open ended receptacle 28 generally coax ial with the nozzle for receiving the nozzle 48 and thereby supporting the projectile 10 . Forwardly and rearwardly fac ing shoulders 61, 62 on the receptacle 28 engage com plementary rearwardly and forwardly facing shoulders 64, 68 on the nozzle 48 for retaining the nozzle in the receptacle and permitting fore and aft sections 50, 52 of the nozzle to move out of the open ends 44, 46 of the receptacle 28 on fusing and separation of the fusible joint means 54 . The forwardly facing shoulder 61 on the receptacle 28 and the rearwardly facing shoulder 64 on the nozzle 48 comprise conical sections generally concentric with the axis of the noz zle. Springs 72 are operatively associated with the nozzle 48 and are effective to maintain the shoulder portions in engagement until complete separation of the fusibie joint 54 , thereby accommodating any thermal expansion of the nozzle.
