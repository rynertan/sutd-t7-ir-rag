# Winding system for flexible conduits and cables.

## Abstract
A cable winding system carried by a vehicle for extending and retracting cable 14 responsive to vehicle movement. The cable 14 frictional y engages a controll ably powered sheave 52 and is guided into a horizontally disposed coil by a cylindrical guide arm 22 having a ver tically directed opening adjacent the sheave 52 and a downwardly, radially and circumferentially directed open ing adjacent the coil. The guide arm 22 is freely rotatable about a vertical axis so that as cable 14 is extended and retracted the guide arm 22 rotates to guide the cable between the coil and sheave 52 . The powered sheave 52 directs cable 14 from the vehicle through an instrumented fairlead 20 which, through a control system, controls the operation of the sheave 52 . The fairlead 20 is pivotally mounted about a horizontal pivot axis 46 so that the head pivots in one direction as the cable is tensioned and in the opposite direction as the cable tension is relieved. The con trol system measures the angle of the fairlead 20 and may also measure the vehicle speed to cause the sheave 52 to extend cable 14 as the fairlead 20 moves rear wardly and or the velocity of the forward vehicle is increased and to retract cable 14 as the fairlead 20 moves forwardly and or the forward velocity of the vehicle is reduced. Also included is a failsafe system for applying the brakes of the vehicle when the supply of cable 14 in the coil falls to a predetermined value or when the fairlead 20 pivots to a point indicative of excessive cable tension and the rotational velocity of the powered sheave 52 is below a predetermined value.
