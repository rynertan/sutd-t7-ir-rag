## Description
POWER OPERATED DEFENSIVE DEVICEBackground of the Invention In security operations or in general police work there is a great need for an instrument or device which can rapidly deliver incapacitating blows to the body of an attacker. Heretofore, the person being attacked could defend with a weapon such as a handgun or could attempt to subdue the attacker with a nightstick or billyclub. Handguns, or indeed guns of any kind are often lethal and in many situations result in the use of excessive force with respect to a given situation.The nightstick in trained hands can be fairly adequate, but particularly in close quarters and where extremely quick reaction is required, the nightstick may be inadequate. Although it may be used to jab at an opponent defensively, the blow delivered depends upon the strength and quickness of the individual wielding the nightstick, and in any case, the defensive range of such a blow is quite limited. Alternatively, a heavy blow must be delivered by swinging the club which oftentimes may require more time or space than is available. Clearly, what is needed in such operations is a weapon which combines some of the attributes of the handgun quickness of response, ability to operate at close quarters and adequate force independent of the physical capability of the user and of the nightstick the ability to incapacitate without lethal effect . The device of the present invention provides such an instrument. It consists essentially of a compact side arm having an elongated member which is linearly extensible by controlled high pressure pneumatic power. The extensible member can, for example, be made to deliver a blow at a distance of two feet or at an even greater distance if this is desired, and the device is constructed to deliver one blow with non lethal but effective restraining force or a succession of rapid, hammering blows as the operator may see fit.By this means, it is entirely feasible for a security guard to ward off and to incapacitate a physically much stronger or larger opponent or an opponent who may be armed with a knife or club. The device has obvious applications in riot control where large numbers of people may be attacking a small number of police and where for reASons already mentioned the use of handguns would be out of the question and the use of nightsticks inadequate.Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, a device is illustrated and disclosed which is adapted to deliver a number of linear blows to an object or adversary, the device comprising an outer casing which defines an elongated barrel for the reception of a shaft slidably movable therein. Means are provided for forming a pressure seal between at least the base of the shaft and the interior of the barrel, and linear bearing means for the shaft are located intermediate the shaft and the interior of the barrel to support relative sliding movement of the shaft within the barrel. The casing further uses pneumatic pressure means and means for releasing the pneumatic pressure to an area behind the base of the shaft to cause the shaft to move from an initial position within the barrel to a position partially extended from the barrel.Movement of the shaft to its fully extended position is limited by stop means which includes a coiled spring adapted to receive a member carried by the shaft in its outward travel, such member causing compression of the spring to effect reverse movement of the member against the base of the shaft to return the shaft to its initial position within the barrel. The device further includes means for delivering a single blow and means for delivering a plurality of rapid blows and means for cushioning the recoil of the shaft upon its return movement within the barrel of the device.Brief Description of the Drawing Figs.la ld are collectively and compositely vertical cross sections of the device of the present invention Fig. 2 is a view taken from the rear of the device looking forwardly along the barrel thereof Fig. 3 is a vertical section taken in the direction of arrows 3 3 of Fig. la Fig. 4 is avertical section taken in the direction of arrows 4 4 of Fig. lc Fig. 5 is a vertical section taken in the direction of arrows 5 5 of Fig. id Fig. 6 is a vertical section taken in the direction of arrows 6 6 of Fig. td and Figs. 7 9 are partial vertical cross sections of the device illustrating the internal movement of the extensible shaft and various internal members related to the support of such movement and to the return of the shaft to its initial position within the barrel of the device.Description of a Particular Embodiment Referring how to the drawing and initially toFigs. la, ib, ic and id thereof, a pneumatic, power operated stun device 10 has been illustrated which is capable of delivering one or a succession of blows to the body of a person against whom the device is directed.Figs. lc and id encompass the power initiating and generating portions of the device 10 which includes an outer casing 11 defining a cylindrical cavity open at one end within which is received a barrel 12. The barrel 12 is rigidly attached to casing 11 by being threaded internally at 12a to the casing 11. The base of the casing 11 defines a cylindrical cavity 13 for the reception of a high pressure container or capsule 14 which may be charged, for example, with air under extremely high pressure, e.g. 3,000 to 5,000 psi. The cavity 13 receives at its open end a plug 16 which is joined to the surrounding casing 11 by a bayonet type joint 16a. Seals 16b provide sealing between the plug 16 and the cylindrical sides of passageway 13. The plug 16 defines high pressure passages 17a and 17b, passage 17a being in coaxial relation with respect to the axis of the capsule 14, and O ring 18 seals the sides of the internal end of plug 16 adjacent to the end 14a of the capsule 14. The end of the capsule 14a is equipped with a spring biased valve not shown which may be displaced by depression of a plunger 14b, the end of which is in contact with pin 19.The latter is a unitary part of a screw 20 which may be threaded into the axial passageway 21 in the plug 16 to cause longitudinal axial displacement of the plunger 146 this to release the compressed air within capsule 14. Screw 20 is sealed with respect to the passage 21 by an O ring 22. Casing 11 further defines passages gila, lib, llc, 11d and lle. Passages 11a and lib directly connect with passages 17a and 17b for the transmission of high pressure air from the capsule 14. In the position of the elements of the device as shown in Fig. Id, passage 11b is sealed by a spool valve 23 which may slide within the passageway 24 defined by casing 11. At its rearward end, spool valve 23 is connected to a pin 26 which is received and is slidable within passageway 27 coaxial with the axis of the spool valve 23. Valve 23 is formed to have major diameter portions 23a and 23b and a recessed section 23c. At the rear of valve 23 a spring 28 biases the valve 23 towards the forward toward the left as viewed in the Figures portion of the device. At its forward end, the valve 23 is in contact with trigger rod 29 which has a conventional trigger 29a to effect sliding reciprocal movement of the trigger rod 29 and consequent reciprocal movement of the valve 23. Rod 29 defines a recess 29b adapter to receive the end of a safety plunger 30 which isspringbiased in the downward or safety off position.A safety catch 31 may be rotated by lever 31a clockwise to cause plunger 30 to be moved against its spring and to cause the end of the plunger 30 to fit within the recess 29b. Catch 31 further defines detent recess 31b which receives spring loaded ball detent 32 when the catch 31 is in a horizontal position. Consequently, when the safety catch 31 is in the horizontal position, the trigger rod 29 will be prevented from rearward movement and the valve 23 will be fixed in the position of Fig.lb however, when the safety catch is in the position shown in Fig. id, the rod 29 can be moved rearwardly by the operator by pulling on the trigger 29a. When the trigger 29a is pulled against stop 33, the valve 23 will be displaced sufficiently to align the recessed section 23c thereof with passageway lib, and consequently, high pressure air in passageway lib may proceed past the valve 23. In this rearward position, valve 23 will block passage lib since the large diameter thereof will have been moved transversely across this passageway. Lying within the barrel 12 is a shaft 35 having a circular base 36. The shaft 35 and its base 36 are slidable within the barrel 12 from an initial position as shown in Figs. la ld to positions where the shaft 35 extends from the barrel 12 Figs. 7 9 . In the illustrated embodiment, the shaft and its base are preferably of steel and a disc shaped magnet 25 attached to casing 11 will retain the shaft and its base in the initial or rearward position. Base 36 is equipped with circumferential sealing member 36a which forms a high pressure, air tight seal between the perimeter of base 36 and the internal diameter of barrel 12, and thus high pressure air discharged against the rear face of base 36 will effect longitudinal movement of shaft 35. Surrounding the rearward end of shaft 35 are two linear bearings 37 and 38. Bearing 37 is free to slide along shaft 35, whereas, bearing 38 is secured to shaft 35 adjacent to base 36 and will move with shaft 35. Barrel 12 defines elongated blast ports 12b and smaller damper ports 12c. Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 6, linear bearing 37 has been provided with a plurality of semicircular grooves 37a. Surrounding the forward end of shaft 35 and within barrel 12 is a third linear bearing 39. Bearing 39 is rigidly secured between retainers 40 and 41 which are anchored to the barrel 12. Spring retention member 42 is secured immediately to the rear of retainer 41 and is secured in this position by means of a screw 43 which passes through the tube 12 and into the retention member. The retention member holds the helical recoil spring 44 in position. The forward end of shaft 35 is threaded into a cylindrical rubber member 45 which is affixed to the end of shaft 35 by a set screw 46. Attached to the rubber member 45 is a hollow, collapsible cylindrical member 47 of suitable resilient material which acts as a connector between the member 45 and the buffer end 48 of the device. The latter is of rubber and is hollow as is the connector 47. The spring 49 will return these parts to the position shown after impact upon the body of an attacker. Parallel to passageway 11c and in communication with the rear face of base 35 is the passageway 11f which is sealed by a valve 50 lying positioned within passageway 11g and lying across passageway llf. Sealing is effected by means of O ring 51. Valve 50 is biased in the sealed position by spring 52 which abuts spring retainer 53. The latter has a central orifice 53a to permit the passage of air from passageway 11f through passageway 11g when the valve 50 is unseated as will be described. The force of the spring 52 will be suffi cient to maintain the valve 50 in its seated position against the air pressure from capsule 14 which is released and directed against the rear face of base member 36.A screw 54 can be adjusted to regulate the flow of air through passage lif. The operation of the device 10 will now be described. Assuming that capsule 14 is fully charged with high pressure air and that the pin 19 has been removed inwardly sufficiently to release air from the capsule into passageways 17a, 17b and gila, llb, the operator of the device after moving safety catch 31 to its off position may pull the trigger 29a rearward to effect operation of the device. When this is done, trigger rod 29 will cause spool valve 23 to move to its full rearward position within cavity 24, thus bringing into alignment the recessed portion 23c and the passageway lib, while causing the greater diameter section 23a to lie across and seal passageway lid.The full pressure within capsule 14 will thereby be felt across the entire rearward surface of base member 36 and the base member carrying with it shaft 35 and linear bearings 37 and 38 will move rapidly to the left as viewed in the figures. Shaft 35 will be extended outwardly from the barrel 12 and the end 48 thereof and related adjacent parts will thereby be capable of delivering a blow upon an attacker. During the forward outward movement of shaft 35, bearing 37 will be carried by base member 35 and bearing 38 into contact with spring 44. This will be so even if the outward movement of shaft 35 is interrupted before its full extension. Thus bearing 37 shall move forwardly to contact and compress due to its momentum spring 44, and will also move past blast ports 12b in the barrel 12.Linear bearing 37 is permitted to move unimpeded in this forward direction because air ahead of its movement has been permitted to escape through ports 12b and because bearing 37 has been provided with peripheral grooves 37a. Having compressed the spring 44, the latter will cause the linear bearing 37 to return rapidly where it will strike the linear bearing 38 attached to base member 36. The energy imparted by this rearward movement of the bearing 37 against bearing 38 and base member 36 is sufficient to return the base member and shaft 35 to its rearward most position assuming the trigger 29a has been released and is in its forward position. During the rearward movement of base member 36, air is permitted to escape from the casing 11 through passageways lic and isle. Fig. 7 illustrates the operation of the device where the shaft 35 and the end thereof 48 have been stopped by hitting a solid object, for example, the body of an attacker. When the outward movement of shaft 35 is stopped before it has been fully extended, the momentum of linear bearing 37 will still move it forward at high speed to cause compression of spring 44 and return movement of bearing 37, shaft 35, etc .However, linear bearing 37 will not have travelled beyond exhaust apertures 12b so that if the trigger 29a and thus valve 23 are held in their rearward position, high pressure air will continue to act against the rear face of base member 36. Linear bearing 37 will be returned against bearing 38 at high velocity to cause partial rearward movement of the base member 36, but immediately the base member will be caused to move in the opposite direction by the air pressure behind it. Thus a series of rapid blows will be delivered against the object in the path of the shaft 35 and the end 48 thereof. In this mode, since high pressure air remains behind base member 36 and passage lic and ile will be blocked by valve 23, the effect of the hammering return action by bearing 37 will be to cause a sharp increase in pressure behind base 36. Valve 50 and its spring 52 will be set to relieve this higher pressure and together with flow restricting screw 54, will cause a damped recoil with respect to the oscillating shaft 35. Figs. 8 and 9 illustrate respectively nearly full stroke action of the device and full stroke action where base 36 has moved past blast ports 12b and therefore pressure behind base 35 has been relieved. When base 35 has moved this far forward, ports 12c at the forward end of barrel 12 provide a dampening action and permit air to escape from the barrel while spring 44 is being compressed. Recoil action through spring 44 and bearing 37 is the same as described. It will be understood that the foregoing description has been of a particular embodiment of the invention and is therefore representative. In order to understand more fully the scope of the invention, reference should be made to the appended claims.
