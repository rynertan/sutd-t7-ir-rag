# WINDING AND INSULATION INSERT DEVICE

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for inserting field windings in axial flux electric machines. Pref erably each field winding 11 is wound in the form of a spiral 38 of wire on an elongate former 20, 140 . The former is then reduced in external dimensions and a press member 32 moves along the former 20, 40 to push the turns 38 into a pair of slots 12 . Apparatus for forming and inserting both insulating sleeve members 15 for the slots 12 and insulating wedges 17 to maintain the windings 11 in position in the slots 12 , is also disclosed.
