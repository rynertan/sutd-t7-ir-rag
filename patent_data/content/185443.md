# Shaft mounted valve position sensor.

## Abstract
In a throttle body fuel injection assembly 10 , a rotor 28 of a throttle position sensor 26 is mounted directly on a throttle shaft 18 and the sensor housing 30 is supported on the rotor 28 , thereby providing a compact sensor construction. A spring 42 in the sensor 26 tends to impart relative rotation between the rotor 28 and the housing 30 , biasing the housing 30 towards engagement with the throttle body 16 . With this invention, the housing 30 rotates with the rotor 28 away from engagement with the throttle body 16 if the spring 42 does not impart relative rotation between the housing 30 and the rotor 28 .
