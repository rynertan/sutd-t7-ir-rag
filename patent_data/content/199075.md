## Abstract
A unit cell is formed by a plurality of sub unit cells as a result of dividing each of the electrodes 2A, 2K and electrolytic plate 1 into a plurality of parts. That is, the electrodes and the eletrolytic plate are each divided into two parts by electrolytic plate support portions 5A, 5K 6A, 6K projected from the surfaces of separators 3A, 3K . The support portions are pressed in contact with the end portions of the electrolytic plate so as to support the electrolytic plate and seal the reaction gas, preventing it from leaking. The electrolyte support portions of the separators can be pro vided with electrolyte supply paths 7 50 , through which the electrolyte is supplied and impregnated into the electrolytic plate. The electrolyte can be supplied via the apertures 8 provided in the separators, to the electrolyte supply paths.
