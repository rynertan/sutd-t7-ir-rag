# Bending fixtures for laying pipes.

## Abstract
A three dimensionally curved configuration is imparted to a straight elongate element by removably retaining one end of the element with its axis coincident with a reference axis, partially pre bending the element away from the reference axis into conformity with a two dimensional first guide path, and thereafter bending the element into confor mity with a three dimensional helical second guide path.
