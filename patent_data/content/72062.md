# EXTERNALLY ACTUATED LIGHT SHIELDING CURTAINS HOUSED IN THE SEALED SPACE OF DOUBLE GLAZINGS

## Abstract
A curtain for shielding light is made from a thin sheet of an easily deformable material, which is totally or partially opaque according to the requirements it is contained in the sealed space of a double glazing and can be operated at will be means of the reciprocal magnetic attraction existing between two mobile parts, the first one being also contained in said sealed space and mechanically connected with said douser, while the second mobile part is outside said sealed space and can be moved by an operator. In an alternative embodiment, the said curtain is operated by means of electrostatic instead of magnetic attraction, and said electrostatic attraction takes place between two electric plates being carried respectively by said curtain, in the form of a metallic or metallized layer, and by the inner face of one of the two glass plates, making up the double glazing, in the form of a layer of a conductive or semiconductive, but in any case at least partly transparent material deposited there upon. A previously impressed tension or deformation will help the said douser to recoil in an orderly manner whenever its extension is less than maximum.
