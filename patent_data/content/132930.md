# Improvements relating to strain gauge assemblies.

## Abstract
Strain gauge transducers 15 are fitted to the leading and trailing faces of a vehicle axle between each wheel 14 and the adjacent suspension 13 . They have strain gauges 6, 7, 8, 9 in balanced bridge formation and their orientation is such that their outputs can be combined in one circuit 16, 17, 18 to produce an indication of axle loading and in another circuit to produce an indication 26 of torsion, these signals not being influenced by irrelevant strains. The information from the transducers can be combined to indicate individual axle load ing, and total loading, and the torsional signal can be used in an anti skid braking system.
