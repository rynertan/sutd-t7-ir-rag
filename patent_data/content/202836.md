# Air supply pump.

## Abstract
A piezoelectrically driven air pump 20 in which a diaphragm 38 comprises a disc 38 and two piezoelectric elements 40, 42 is clamped between two halves 44a,44b of a pump housing 44 to define two chamber portions 94, 96 . During vibration of the diaphragm 38 , air pulses are alternately expelled through outlet passage portions 86, 74 positioned on opposite sides of the diaphragm 38 . The air pulses are collected in a rectifying device 100 , carried by the housing 44 , for delivery to a fluidic device or system.
