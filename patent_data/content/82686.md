# Load sensor, e.g. for sensing a vehicle draft load.

## Abstract
An open frame 10 consists of two limbs with parallel central portions 18 and 20 . The limbs are joined at their ends for attachment in a hitch to measure a draft load, which pulls the central portions 18 and 20 slightly together. This movement is measured by an inductive transducer 26 fitted between the limbs. The transducer comprises a base 28 and a cap 36 carrying the transducer coils 54 and slidable core 56 respectively. To facilitate mounting and removal, the cap and body can be pressed in together against a spring 62 to engage or disengage end projections 30 and 51 in holes 24 and 22 in the two limb portions 18 and 20 respectively. portions 18 and 20 respectively.
