# Microtome.

## Abstract
Device in a microtome in which a knife 1 and a specimen 2 are displaceable with respect to one another in two perpendicular planes, one of which is parallel to the cutting surface and the other is parallel to the knife edge, for obtaining a cutting movement or a feeding movement in the microtome, the device being used for obtaining at least one of these movements, the device consisting of at least one spring link 30 in which the moveable part 5 is suspended whereby the link consists of at least two in said plane located crossed leaf springs 27, 28, 29 and driving means 7, 8 arranged between the moveable part 5 and the casing of the microtome 3 so as to achieve said displacement.
