# A method for separating T cells from leukocytes.

## Abstract
The use of a hydrophobic, water insoluble, granular porous organic polymer having an average pore diameter of 500 to below 5,000Ã… has been found to be extremely effective for separating T cells from leukocytes when the latter is contacted with the porous organic polymer in the presence of an animal serum protein.
