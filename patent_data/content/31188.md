# Homokinetic coupling.

## Abstract
The improvement concerns the retaining of the flat tened balls as applied in this type of homokinetic joints wherein this type of balls are applied. Instead of applying retaining member for every ball a specific cage 20 providec with pockets 24 for fixing the balls 3 is applied. Its perfor mance however is completely different from the existing Rzeppa CV joint cage according to which this cage forms a steering member. Due to the self positioning feature of the flattened balls 3 the improved cage 20 therefore is resi lient e.g. can be made of a plastic, but preferable of plasto lub or the like oil exuding compositions.
