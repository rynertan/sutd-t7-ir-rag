# Magnetization arrangement for transformers.

## Abstract
In a transformer having a primary winding 11 which is connectable to an a.c. voltage source 13 via switch means 14 which opens and closes at a controllable frequency, there is connected in parallel with the primary or secondary winding 11, 12 of the transformer 10 a circuit 21 which for at least a part of the time during which the switch means 14 opens maintains magnetization of the transformer 10 in a direction opposite to the direction of the magnetization caused by the subsequent closing of the switch means 14 .
