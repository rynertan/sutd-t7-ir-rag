# MECHANISED STORE USABLE IN A TRANSFER LINE TO ACCUMULATE PIECES BEING TRANSFERRED ALONG THE LINE

## Abstract
A mechanised store usable in a transfer line 2 to accumulate pieces 3 being transferred along the line, comprises a fixed structure 4 arranged adjacent the transfer line 2 and including a plurality of supports 5 for the storage of pieces 3 , superimposed in several adjacent vertical rows, and an elevator assembly 7 located on the side of the fixed structure 4 away from the transfer line 2 . The elevator assembly comprises a fixed framework, a platform movable vertically relative to the fixed framework, a carriage movable horizontally on the platform, and a telesco pic fork device carried by the carriage and arranged to locate and take up pieces 3 respectively on and from the supports 5 of the said fixed structure 4 . The mechanised store further includes a transfer device 27 located at the base of each vertical row of supports 5 of the said fixed structure 4 for taking up pieces from the transfer line and transferring them with a stepwise movement into a position in which they are taken up by the telescopic fork device of the elevator assembly 7 , or vice versa, after the fork device has first been positioned at the height of the transfer line.
