# Pressure sensitive conductive rubber material.

## Abstract
A pressure sensitive conductive rubber material which comprises an inorganic filler of at least one type selected from a group consisting of conductive carbon black, short fiber of nonmetailic inorganic material, powder and whisker dis persed in a rubber matrix at least in rubber having electric insulation. Thus, the rubber material can improve the prop erties of the rubber material in which a conductive member is dispersed in an insulating rubber matrix, gradually reduce its resistance value as a pressing force increases, can obtain a wide range of relationship between the pressing force and the resistance value with large varying width of its resistance value, and has characteristics as a pressure sensor having excellent fatigue creep resistances.
