# Improvements in and relating to data error detection.

## Abstract
A system is described for recognising a data word in a serially presented data stream by comparing the currently presented data with a predetermined datum word. The bits of the presented data are fed into the stages A to L of a shift register 6 which correspond to respective bits of the datum word. A monitoring unit 16 monitors the states of only those stages stages D,G,I and K corresponding to positions where changes in the value of the datum word occur, together with the start stage A and the final stage M. Merely monitoring these particular stages enables the unit 16 to measure the actual change in error between the presented data word and the datum word which will occur in response to the next data shift. An error counting unit 14 algebraically sums the error change values received on line 20 with an initialised count value corresponding to a predetermined initial state of the register 6 to produce a total error signal on line 22. A comparator 24 compares this with a minimum acceptable error threshold on a line 26 so as to produce a recognition output on line 28.

## Description
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to arrangements for detecting errors in data, specifically digital data.Embodiments of the invention to be described in more detail below are for use in recognising a received data word comprising a plurality of data bits . Such a data word may be a preamble to a stream of data and needs to be recognised so as to place the receiving apparatus in a state of readiness such as by synchronising it. Ideally of course, the recognition would be arranged to take place only when the received data word was exactly correct that is, there were no errors between it and the predetermined form of the word. In a practical case, however, noise will be present and it may be unrealistic only to allow recognition when there are no errors at all. It is therefore known to measure the amount of error and to permit recognition when the amount of error is less than a predetermined threshold. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccording to the invention there is provided a method of monitoring presented digital data in order to recognise a digital data word by comparison with a datum word, comprising the steps of determining, at each presentation of the digital data, the change in the number of errors between the presented digital data and the datum word as compared with the last presentation of the digital data, and accumulating the values of the said changes until the accumulated value indicates recognition.According to the invention there is also provided a system responsive to presented digital data so as to recognise a digital data word by comparing the presented digital data with a datum word, comprising a plurality of storage locations respectively corresponding to the digits of the datum word, means for respectively storing the digits of the presented digital data in the said storage locations, means for shifting the digital data between the storage locations so that in response to each shift each digit moves to the next succeeding storage location, a fresh digit enters the first storage location and the digit in the storage location corresponding to the last digit in the datum word exits therefrom, monitoring means for monitoring the values of the digits in only those particular storage locations corresponding to positions in the datum word where changes in its digit values occur whereby to produce error change outputs corresponding to the changes in error between the presented digital data and the datum word resulting from the data shifts, and accumulating means for accumulating the values of the error change outputs whereby to recognise when the total error between the presented digital word and the datum word is less than a predetermined value. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSData recognition systems and methods according to the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which Figure 1 is a block diagram showing one form of the system Figure 2 is a more detailed block diagram of part of a modified form of the system Figure 3 is a block diagram of another form of the system and Figure 4 is a block diagram of part of a further form of the system. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSAs shown in Figure 1, the system is intended to recognise an incoming data word which arrives on a line 5 connected to the input of a shift register 6.In this example, the shift register has thirteen stages A,B...M. The predetermined data word to be recognised referred to below as the datum word has twelve data bits in this example and has the binary form 000111001100 , as shown in Figure 1 immediately above the shift register 6.When the system is set into operation, it is first initialised by an initialising unit 8. By means of a line 10, this sets the stages of the shift register 6 to be predetermined states. For example, it could set all stages of the shift register to binary 1. There will thus be a predetermined and known number of errors between the datum data word and the actual data word the stream of binary 1 s in the example being assumed in the shift register 6, and, by means of a line 12, the initialising unit 8 sets the value of this initial error seven, in fact into an error counting unit 14. In a manner to be described in more detail below, certain of the stages of the shift register 6 are connected to an error change detecting unit 16 by means of a data link shown generally at 18. By means of these lines, the unit 16 monitors certain of the stages of the shift register 6 each time a new data bit enters from the line 5 and consequently shifts all the data bits in the shift register by one stage to the right , and in a manner to be explained determines whether there has been an increase in the error between the data word currently in the shift register and the datum word, a decrease in such error, or no change. Data representing this determination is fed to the unit 14 on a line 20 and alters the error count in that unit accordingly. The process is repeated each time a new bit enters the shift register 6 from the line 5.In this way, therefore, the error counting unit 14 contians continuously updated data representing the number of errors between the actual data word in the shift register 6 and the datum word, and data representing the value of this error count is output on a line 22 to one input of a comparator 24. The other input receives an error threshold value on a line 26. When the actual error count falls below the threshold value, the comparator produces a recognition signal on a line 28, indicating that the incoming data word has been recognised that is, it has not more than a predetermined relatively small number of errors as compared with the datum word.Therefore, the system monitors only the actual change in number of errors, each time a new data bit arrives.It does not carry out a measurement of the total number of errors each time the data word in the shift register changes. In a manner to be explained, this means that only a certain number of the stages of the shift register 6 need to be monitored, resulting in simplified construction and increased speed of operation.Figure 2 illustrates part of the system of Figure 1 in more detail, and items in Figure 2 corresponding to those in Figure 1 are correspondingly referenced. In particular, Figure 2 illustrates the data links 18 between the shift register 6 and the error change detecting unit 16 of Figure 1.As shown, the data links 18 comprise links from certain of the stages only, of the shift register 6, these stages being stages, A,D,G,I,K and M, these links being referenced 30,32,34,36,38 and 40 respectively and each being connected to a respective monitoring unit 42,44,46,48,50 and 52. In the manner to be explained, each of these units 42 to 52 produces an output on a respective output line 54,56,58,60,62,64, each time there is a shift of data, each of these outputs representing part of the total change in the error between the actual data word in the shift register and the datum data word. The lines 54 to 64 are connected to an adding unit 70 which determines the algebraic sum of all the inputs on the lines 54 to 64 so as to produce the required total error change output on line 20 see Fig. 1 . The operation of the monitoring units 42 to 52 will now be considered in more detail.It will be noted that these units only monitor those stages of the register 6 corresponding to the positions where the state of the datum word changes from one binary value to the other in addition, the stages A and M are monitored for a purpose to be explained . Thus, stage D corresponds to the position where the datum word changes from 0 to 1, stage G corresponds to the position where the datum word changes from 1 to 0, stage 1 corresponds to the position where the datum word changes from 0 to 1, and stage K corresponds to the position where the datum word changes from 1 to 0.The system monitors only those stages indicated above because it is only data shifts from those stages and into stages A and M which can result in changes in the total error count.Consider, first, position C. This is a stage where the expected data bit is 0, that is, this is the bit in the corresponding position of the datum word. If the actual data bit in stage C is in fact 0, it will contribute zero to the total error count. However, when that data bit 0 shifts into stage D it will shift into a position where the expected data bit is 1 and will therefore increase the total error count by one. However, if the actual data bit in stage C is binary 1, the opposite applies. Thus, when this data bit is present in stage C it will be contributing one to the total error count. However, when that data bit shifts into stage D, it will there contribute zero to the total error count. In other words, there will be a decrease in the total error count of one.Therefore, the rule which applies to those stages of the shift register 6 stages D and I in this example where the datum word changes from binary 0 to binary 1, when each data shift occurs, can be stated thus TABLE 1EMI9.1 Data SEP bit SEP Change SEP in SEP total SEP no, tb SEP of SEP errors tb SEP 1 SEP decrease SEP by SEP one tb SEP 0 SEP increase SEP by SEP one tb It is believed to be clear by analogy from the foregoing that the rule which applies for the positions in the shift register stages G and K in this example where the corresponding bit of the datum word changes from binary 1 to binary 0 can be status thus TABLE 2EMI10.1 tb Date SEP bit SEP Change SEP in SEP total SEP no. tb SEP of SEP errors tb SEP 1 SEP increase SEP by SEP one tb SEP decrease SEP SEP by SEP one tb The effect of data shifts at the beginning and end of the shift regiter needs special consideration. Thus, for all the other stages considered above, a data shift will either result in an increase in the total error or a decrease it is not possible for there to be no change in the error.However, for stage A, it is possible for there to be no change in the total error or an increase in the error when a data shift ito this stage occurs thus, if a binary 0 enters stage A, there will be no change n the error count, whereas entry of a binary 1 will increase the total error count and of course if the bit of the data word corresponding to stage A were binary 1 instead of binary 0, entry of a binary 1 would result in no change in the error count and entry of a binary 0 would again result in an increase of the error. At the end of shift register 6, there can either be no change in the error count or a decrease in the error count when data shifts out of stage L.Thus, if in the present example the data bit in stage L is binary 0, its shift into stage M will result in no change in the total error count, while if it were a binary 1, its shift into stage M would decrease the total error count by one correspondingly, if the bit in the data word corresponding to stage L were binary 1 instead of binary 0, the reverse would apply that is, shift of a binary 1 from stage L to stage M would result in no change in the error count whereas shift of the binary 0 from stage L to stage M would result in a decrease of one in the total error count.Therefore, the rule which applies to data shifts into the start stage, stage A, of the shift register can be summarised thus TABLE R EMI12.1 tb Expected SEP start SEP Actual SEP Change SEP in SEP total SEP no. tb data SEP bit SEP data SEP bit SEP of SEP errors tb SEP 0 SEP O SEP no SEP change tb SEP 0 SEP 1 SEP increase SEP by SEP one tb SEP 1 SEP O SEP SEP increase SEP by SEP one tb SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP no SEP change tb The rule which applies to data shifts out of the stage stage L corresponding to the last bit in the datum word can be summarised thus TABLE 4EMI12.2 tb Expected SEP end SEP Actual SEP data SEP Change SEP in SEP total SEP no tb data SEP bit SEP bitin SEP stage SEP M SEP of SEP errors tb SEP Q SEP SEP O SEP no SEP change tb SEP 0 SEP 1 SEP decrease SEP by SEP one tb SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP decrease SEP by SEP one tb SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP no SEP change tb The foregoing explains why it is necessary for the shift register 6 to have one more stage than the number of bits In the datum word, Each of the .units 4.2 to to 52 operates according to one of the rules defined by TABLES 1 to 4 above. Thus, each of these units receives the value of the data bit currently in the corresponding stage of the shift register 6 and monitors that value.Each of the units 42 to 52 is controlled by signals received on a line 74 which control the clocking of data into the shift register 6. Therefore, each time there is a shift of data, each of the units 42 to 52 produces an appropriate output on the corresponding one of the output lines 54 to 64 in accordance with the actual value of the data bit in the corresponding stage of the shift register and in accordance with the particular rule determined by the corresponding one of the TABLES above . Therefore, lines 56,58,60 and 62 will each carry a signal representing either an increase by one or a decrease by one in the total error count, line 54 will carry a signal representing either no change in the error count or an increase by one, while line 64 will carry a signal representing either no change in the error count or a decrease by one.The unit 70 therefore sums all the individual error ehange signals received on lines 54 to 64 and the resultant total is output on line 20.The units 42 to 52 can be implemented as parts of a look up table and so can the adder unit 70. In fact, it is clearly possible to implement the units 42 to 52 and the adder unit 70 by means of a single look up table with the lines 30 to 40 being connected to respective and predetermined addresses. This follows because, for any given combination of data bits on the lines 30 to 40, there will clearly be a single corresponding output on line 20. It will be apparent that the system described requires in this example only six of the stages of a thirteen stage shift register to be monitored. As a generality, it is found that systems of the type described require on average slightly more than half the total number of shift register stages to be monitored as compared with other systems which measure the total number of errors each time there is a data shift such other systems clearly require each shift register stage to be monitored. Obviously, the saving in the number of shift register stages which has to be monitored depends on the format of the datum word the greater the number of data changes shici, it contains, the greater will be the number of shift register stages which have to be monitored.The saving in the number of shift register stages which has to be monitored considerably reduces the complexity of the required circuitry and also considerably increases the speed of operation.In practice, the datum word may contain a considerably greater number of data bits than the twelve assumed in this example. Therefore, even though the number of shift register stages which has to be monitored is very considerably reduced, there may still be a relatively large number to be monitored. However, a simplification of the circuitry can be achieved by multiplexing the operation as will now be described with reference to Figure 3 in which parts corresponding to those in the other Figures are correspondingly referenced.As shown in Figure 3, the output lines 30 to 40 of the shift register 6 are connected into a multiplexer 80 which has an output channel 82 connected to a look up table 84 which performs the functions of the monitoring units 42 to 52 and the adding unit 70 ofFigure 2. The look up table 84 produces a resultant change in error count, after each data shift, on the line 20. This is fed into an accumulator 86 which, together with a feedback connected latch 88, carries out the function of the error counting unit 14 ofFigure 1.The multiplexer 80 is controlled by a multiplexcontrol unit 90. This is synchronised with the data shift signals received on line 74 and operates by connecting each of the lines 30 to 40 in turn to the look up table 84 via the data channel 82, this control being exerted by means of a control line 92. In a practical example, the multiplexer 80 might not connect the lines 30 to 40 individually to the data output channel 82 but in groups.Clearly, the TABLES above show that the rules which apply to the processing of the data received on the lines 30 to 40 are not all the same. As explained, the rules vary according to whether the relevant shift register stage is at the start or end of the shift register or is an intermediate stage. The look up table 84 cannot therefore correctly process the data received on the channel 82 unless it is aware of b origin of that data. The look up table 84 therefore has to be controlled by control signals on a line 94 so that the data recei ve d on channel 82 is fed to the correct addresses in the look up table, according to whether it has originated from the start or end stages of the shift register or from an intermediate stage.The accumulator 86 clearly has to carry out its accumulating function in a series of sequential steps corresponding to the multiplexing process. Thus, for a given state of the shift register 6, the multiplexer 80 carries out a sequence of steps during which the lines 30 to 40 are successively monitored either individually or in groups . At the end of each such step, an output is produced on line 20 representing part of the total error change detected and this is fed into the accumulator 86 where it is added to the data currently being fed into the accumulator from the latch 88 via the feedback channel 89. The latch 88 carries data representing the previous state of the accumulator 86. It is assumed that the accumulator 86 has been initialised in the manner explained with reference to Figure 1.At the end of the sequence of steps corresponding to a single state of the shift register 6, the accumulator produces an output on line 22 corresponding to the actual number of errors between the data actually in the shift register 6 and the datum word.The accumulator 86 may itself be in the form of a look up table because the data inputs which it receives via channels 20 and 89 always correspond to a unique total error count on line 22. In fact, if the accumulator 86 is in the form of a look up table, it may be arranged not simply to produce an output corresponding to the total error but in fact to produce an output indicating whether or not the word currently in the shift register 6 corresponds within the predetermined error limit with the datum word.In this way, therefore, the look up table can carry out the function not only of the error counting unit 14 of Figure 1 but also the function of the comparator 24 as well.In such a case, the look up table constituting the unit 86 can also be programmed to produce a warning signal when the total error count has reached such a value to indicate that a fault has occurred examples of this are a negative error or an error greater than the total length of the shift register 6. Such a warning signal could be used to reset the system.In the system illustrated in Figure 3, the initialising unit 8 would carry out the initialising process by holding the latch 88 in a predetermined state for a complete sequence of multiplexing steps.The arrangement shown in Figure 3 is complicated by the fact that the look up table 84 has to be controlled, by the control signals on the line 94, in dependence on the origin of the signals on the data channel 82 because of the different rules which apply to the data bits in the start , end and intermediate stages of the shift register 6. In other words, the look up table cannot simply operate by sensing the value of the data received on the line 82 but must take into account where it has come from.Figure 4 shows a modified arrangement which can be used in certain circumstances and which avoids this problem. In Figure 4, parts corresponding to those in other Figures are similarly referenced. The arrangement to be described with reference to Figure 4 is only feasible where the total number of shift register stages to be monitored is the product of the number of inputs to the look up table and the number of ways of multiplexing those inputs. In the particular example to be described with reference toFigure 4, the shift register 6 is assumed to have 63 stages, plus an endn stage corresponding to stage M of the embodiments previously described . The form of the datum word is such that thirty three of the total number of shift register stages have to be monitored. The look up table 84 has eleven inputs and the multiplexing arrangement to be described can multiplex these eleven inputs in three ways, thus therefore requiring a sequence of three multiplexing steps to inspect all thirty three relevant stages of the shift register 6.As shown in Figure 4, lines 100 and 102 respectively connect the start and end stages of the shift register 6 to a converting unit 104, together with a line 106 which comes from one of the intermediate stages of the shift register to be monitored. A second converting unit 107 has three inputs which are respectively connected to three intermediate stages of the shift register, and a third converting unit 108 likewise has three inputs connected to three other intermediate stages of the shift register respectively.A further nine intermeiate stages of the shift register are connected to a multiplexing unit 112, these nine stages being stages for which the rule inTABLE 1 applies. The remaining fifteen of the thirty three monitored stages are connected to a further multiplexer 114, these stages being stages for which the rule in TABLE 2 applies.To avoid complexity, the intermediate stages are not actually shown connected to the shift register.Multiplexer 112 has three output lines 116,118 and 120 which are connected to the look up table 84. The multiplexer 112 operates by connecting its nine input lines to the three output lines, three at a time.The multiplexer 114 has five output lines 122,124,126,128 and 130 and operates by connecting its fifteen input lines to the five output lines, five at a time. It will be appreciated that each of the lines 116 to 130 carries either a binary 0 or a binary 1 signal, according to the value of the data bits in the corresponding stage of the shift register 6.The converting units 104, 107 and 108 operate by converting the binary data which they receive which simply represent the values of the bits in the corresponding stages of the shift register into a different form. As will be explained, this is done to take account of the fact that the rules which apply to data from the start and end stages of the shift register are different from the rule which applies to data from the intermediate stages.It will be apparent from TABLE 3 that the data presented on line 100 from the start stage of the shift register can contribute either zero or plus one to the total error count, while, from TABLE 4, the data received on line 102 from the end stage can contribute zero or minus one to the total error count.The data presented on line 106 will either contribute plus one or minus one to the total error count seeTABLES 1 and 2 . Therefore, the total error change produced by the data on the three lines 100,102 and 106 will have one of the following decimal values 2, 1,0, 1, 2.Each of the three input lines to the converting unit 107 can contribute either plus one or minus one to the total error change from TABLES 1 and 2 and the same applies to the three input lines to the converting unit 110. The contribution of all three input lines of converting unit 107 to the total error change can therefore have any one of the following decimal values 3 1, 1, 3 and the same applies for the input lines to the converting unit 108.Each converting unit 104,107,108 therefore converts the data received on its three input lines into data on three output lines which respectively represent the sign of the combined error change represented by the three inputs to that converting unit, the value of the most significant bit MSB in the binary representation of the decimal value of that combined error change and the value of the least significant bit LSB of that decimal value. Thus, for converting unit 104, line 140 carries a bit representing the sign, line 142 carries a bit representing the MSB value and line 144 carries a bit representing the LSB value. For converting unit 107, lines 140B,142B and 144B correspond to lines 140,142 and 144 respectively and so do lines 140C,142C and 144C of converting unit 108.In this way, therefore, the groups of signals output by the three converting units 104,107 and 108 represent, in the same format, the contribution to the total error change value made by the inputs to those converting units even though two of the inputs to the unit 104 contribute to the total error change value according to respective rules which are different from those operating for all the other inputs to the converting units.The three groups of lines from the converting units 104,107 and 108 are connected to a multiplexer 158 which has three outputs, and the unit 158 operates by connecting its nine inputs to the three outputs 152,154 and 156, three at a time, the outputs 152,154 and 156 being connected to respective inputs of the look up table 84.It will be apparent that the described arrangement enables the look up table 84 to operate directly in response to each group of eleven input signals presented to it unlike the look up table 84 in the embodiment shown in Figure 3, it does not have to be functionally adjusted during the multiplexing cycle to take the origins of the data presented to it into account.Thus, during the first step of the three step multiplexing cycle, the look up table 84 will receive eleven inputs made up of a three inputs from one of the converting units 104,107 and 108 via multiplexer 158 and representing the sign, MSB and LSB of the error change contribution made by the three inputs to that converting unit, b three inputs from the nine lines fed to the multiplexer 112, and c five inputs from the fifteen lines fed to the multiplexer 114.During the second multiplexing step, it receives a three inputs from a different. one of the three converting units 104,107 and 108, b three inputs from a different group of three of the nine lines feeding multiplexer 112, and c five inputs from a different group of five of the fifteen lines feeding multiplexer 114. Finally, in the third step of the multiplexing cycle, it receives a three inputs from the third one of the converting units 104,108 and 110, b three inputs from the final group of three of the nine lines feeding the multiplexer 112, and c five inputs from the final group of five of the fifteen lines feeding the multiplexer 114.Obviously, the look up table 84 is set up so as to take into account the difference in format between the data presented on the lines 152,1511 and 156 on the one hand and the data presented on the other eight input lines on the other hand. After each step of the multiplexing cycle, the look up table 84 produces an error change value on the output line 20 and this may be fed to an accumulator of the form described with reference to Figure 3 for measurement of the total error and for carrying out the final recognition process.In the system described, the monitored stages of the shift register are those stages which immediately follow a change in the value of the datum word.However, instead, stages immediately preceding changes in the value of the datum word could be monitored. In such a case, the extra stage, stage M, would be replaced by a stage preceding stage A.
