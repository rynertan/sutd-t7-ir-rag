# Assay method and device.

## Abstract
A method and device for assaying a test substance utilizing a primary absorbent substance for selectively allowing only a quantity of an analytical reagent propor tional to the quantity of test substance to pass therethrough when test substance and analytical reagent are contacted with the primary absorbent an analytical absorbent is dis posed in a series of zones for sequentially absorbing the analytical reagent which passes through the primary absor bent so that detection of the last zone of absorbed analytical reagent indicates the quantity of test substance the method comprises passing test substance and analytical reagent through the primary absorbent and then the analytical absorbent followed by detection of the last zone in which analytical reagent is absorbed.
