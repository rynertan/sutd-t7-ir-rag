# Yieldable upright assembly.

## Abstract
A vertical member, for example of a sign post, is attached to a base member by one or more couplings comprising a web having at least one linear groove therein and an opening adjacent at least one end of the groove or grooves and generally transverse thereto, the portion of the web on one side of the opening being attached to the vertical member and the portion of the web on the other side of the opening being attached to the base member, the groove in the so attached coupling being generally vertical. Under horizontal impact loading the transverse forces tear the web along the groove, but under weight or wind loadings longitudinal shearing forces are exerted on the groove which is thus able to sustain higher such loadings.
