# A piston pump.

## Abstract
A piston pump includes a cylinder 26 with a bore 27 receiving the piston 24 . The piston 24 forms a central passage 34 leading to a variable volume chamber 42 and a check valve 40 is disposed in the central passage. In addition, the cylinder 26 includes a pair of ports 48, 50 which selectively communicate with the variable volume chamber 42 . The pair of ports 48, 50 and the central passage 34 communicate a reservoir with the variable volume chamber 42 .
