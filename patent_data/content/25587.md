# Apparatus for and method of separating and maintaining separated particulate material from a fluid phase and sealed plastic fluid storage container.

## Abstract
A blood bag 10 is described which aids in main taining the separation of blood components. This bag 10 is constructed of a flexible plastic, has a conical top leading to an outlet line 28 and internal septa 32 to reduce swirling of the bag s contents during rotor decele ration. The bag 10 , is adapted to be placed in a split sleeve 12 prior to placement in the swinging bucket of a centrifuge rotor. A collar 14 is placed over the top of the bag 10 to aid in reducing wrinkles in the bag 10 . Methods are described for reducing contamination of separated blood components by reducing bag wrinkles, reducing swirling of the blood fractions during rotor dece leration, and reducing mixing during expression.
