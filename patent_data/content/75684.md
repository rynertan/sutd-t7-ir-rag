# Real time ordinal value filter utilizing half interval ranking.

## Abstract
A hardware logic network, operating at real time data rates, generates a signal which matches the Mth largest signal of an input data set. To accomplish this signal matching, the network utilizes an iterative series of value adjustments which cause an intermediate working quantity to converge to a number whose rank in comparison to the input set is the same as that of the true Mth largest. When test comparisons indicate that the intermediate value s relative rank is too low, the value adjustment is upward. The adjustment is downward otherwise. Operating upon input data whose range of possible values is limited to a predeter mined interval, the system takes as its initial working quantity the midpoint of this interval. The magnitude of the first adjustment is one half of the remaining interval on either side of the initial approximation. Subsequent magnitu de adjustments are in turn one half of the preceding half remaining interval magnitude. When the number R of inputs is odd and M is set equal to R 1 2, the network becomes a real time median filter.
