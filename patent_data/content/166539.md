# PRODUCT DISPENSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A pusher 2 is urged by a tensator spring 16 towards one end of a stack of packs in order to dispense them. Movement of the pusher 2 in the opposite direction is prevented. The pusher 2 is connected via a belt 15 to a drum 17 carrying magnets 21 which actuate a reed switch 8 generating a sig nal representing the distance through which the pusher 2 moves when one or more packs are dispensed, this distance being proportional to the number of packs dispensed.
