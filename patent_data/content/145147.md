# Sewing machine operating station.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a sewing machine operating station which cooperates with an overhead conveyor system 10 having a number of trolleys 11 which convey partly formed garments between working stations. Each trolley has a delivery arm 12 from which garmets can be suspended, and delivered to a working station. Each working station comprises a table 14 , a sewing machine 15 mounted on the table, and a working surface 16 adjacent to the sewing machine and onto which a partly formed garment can be placed in order to undergo a sewing operation. An inverted L shaped guide 17 is mounted on the table 14 and can be coupled up with the delivery arm 12 of a trolley 11 so as to guide a supply of partly formed garments, suspended there from, to a position adjacent to the working surface 16 . In addition, the working surface comprises a first part 16 which is located adjacent to the sewing machine 15 and a second part 24 which can be moved between a first position in which it adjoins the first part 16 to form a joint substantially horizontal working surface for one mode of operation of the station, and a second position in which it extends downwardly of the first part 16 so that the first part only forms a substantially horizonal working surface for a second mode of operation of the station.
