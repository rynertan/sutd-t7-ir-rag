# GASOLINE ECONOMIZING DEVICE FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

## Abstract
A device for use in association with a carburetor C of the type used for supplying fuel at the intake manifold M of a gasoline internal combustion engine has an annular chamber 17 at the exit port of the carburetor C , adapted to collect uncarbureted raw gasoline particles or globules for drainage through an external vaporizing system under the influence of the vacuum created at the intake manifold M during operation of the engine for reintroduction as vapo rized fuel at the intake manifold M , thereby converting raw gasoline, otherwise wastefully fed to the engine, into efficiently combustible fuel. The usual throttle butterfly valve 43 of the carburetor C is modified to provide a collection chamber 48 for raw gasoline which is continuously with drawn through an axial passageway 45 in the butterfly valve pivotal axle 44 for drainage through the external vaporizing system.
