A process is disclosed for the treatment of highly ole finic gasoline containing at least about 50 by weight of olefins by contacting said olefinic gasoline with a special group of acidic crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites, such as those of the ZSM 5 type in order to enhance the gum stability of said gasoline and produce products comprising both gasoline and fuel oil.
