# Angular rate sensor.

## Abstract
A dual polarization interferometer is employed for use as an angular rate sensor. A single waveguide 60 is provided for propagating wave components of each of two polarized waves traveling in opposite directions. Each wave traveling through the waveguide is phase shifted by a value related to the rotation rate of the waveguide.
