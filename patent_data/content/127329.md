# Electrostatic reproducing machine.

## Abstract
Electrostatographic reproducing apparatus comprising a reusable electrostatographic imaging web 10 having an insulting imaging surface positioned between a web supply roll 20 and a web take up roll 14 , each roll being fastened to the end of the web. The web is provided with means 41, 30, 36 to form an electrostatic latent image on the web and develop 55 said image with a toner. The image is formed and developed on the passage of the web from the supply roll 20 to the take up roll 14 where the web with the toner image thereon is brought into contact with a copy sheet and wound around the take up roll during the first cycle of a two cycle imaging process. The apparatus includes a copy substrate entrance 48 plus means 50 to feed the copy substrate along a copy path with a distance AB along the imaging surface path from the image forming station with lead edge of an image is formed in the imaging surface to the initial line of contact of the imaging surface with the copy substrate being equal to the distance CB along the copy substrate path in the copy sheet entrance to the initial line of contact with the lead edge of the image on the imaging surface. The copy substrate is wound around the take up roll to form a sandwich compris ing the insulating layer and the electrostatic latent image the toner image copy substrate dielectric layer and conductive layer to which a potential is applied after the sandwich has been formed of a magnitude in potential sufficient to create an electric field to transfer toner from the insulating layer to the copy substrate. The electrostatic latent image present on the insulating layer is discharged before the copy substrate is stripped from the dielectric layer.
