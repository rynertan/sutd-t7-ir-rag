# WATER HEATER CONSTRUCTION AND METHOD OF HEATING WATER WATER HEATER CONSTRUCTION AND METHOD OF HEATING WATER

## Abstract
A water heater including a water tight tank having a tank wall and top and bottom head members welded thereto. A combustion chamber and burner are mounted beneath the bottom head. A pair of concentrically arranged jacket members are mounted around the tank wall with the space between the jacket members serving as a flow passageway through which combustion air flows downwardly to the combustion chamber. A pair of concentrically arranged tube assemblies are connected to the top of the heater. The inside tube assemblies carry products of combustion from the heater and the space between the inside tube assemblies and the outside tube assemblies serve as a flow passageway through which combustion air flows to the flow passageway space between the jacket members.
