## Abstract
A novel filament composed of at least one thermoplastic synthetic polymer, said filament being characterized by having 1 an irregular variation in the size of its cross section along its longitudinal direction, and 2 a coefficient of intrafilament cross sectional area variation CV F of 0.05 to 1.0 and a bundle of said filaments. The bundle of filament like fibers can be produced by extruding a melt of a thermoplastic synthetic polymer through a spinneret having such a structure that discontinuous elevations Hi are provided between adjacent small openings Ai on the extruding side of the spinneret, and the melt extruded from one opening can move to and from the melt extruded from another opening adjacent thereto or vice versa through a depression existing between said elevations and taking up the extrudates from the small openings while cooling them by supplying a cooling fluid to the extrusion surface of said spinneret or its beighborhood, whereby said extrudate are converted into numerous separated fine fibrous streams and solidified. The spinneret and molding apparatus comprising the spinneret with means to cool the filaments as they leave the spinneret also form part of the invention. The filaments are more like natural fibers than filaments produced by conventional extrusion techniques and can be used to provide a variety of fiber products, such as textile fabrics. The spinneret can be used to provide more filaments per unit area of the extrusion surface than can be prepared with conventional spinnerets.
