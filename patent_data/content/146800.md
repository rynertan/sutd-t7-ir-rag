# Checking device for cigarette groups.

## Abstract
The optoelectronic device for checking the number, and or the regularity of the ends, of the cigarettes making up an orderly group of cigarettes to be packed, comprises a box like cigarette checking head 1 in which a number of feeler pins 2 is axially slidably mounted, the said feeler pins 2 being pressed against the cigarette ends, and controlling a number of intercepting screens 4 located between light sources 10 , such as light emitting diodes, and photosensi tive elements 11 , such as phototransistors. Air under pressure is fed into the box like cigarette cnecking head 1 , and is caused to first sweep the light sources 10 and the photosensitive elements 11 . Thus, dust is prevented from settling down on the light sources 10 and on the photosen sitive elements 11 , and the air under pressure flowing out of the box like cigarette checking head 1 through the feeler pin guiding bores 3, 8 will remove any dust from said bores and guarantee the slidability of the feeler pins 2 .
