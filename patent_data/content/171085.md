# Vulcanized rubber article and the process for production thereof.

## Abstract
The subject matter of the invention is a vulcanized rubber layer, and non porous and homogenized thermoplastic polyurethane layer s having an average thickness of 0.02 1.0 mm on at least one surface of the vulcanized rubber layer, said polyurethane layer s being integrally fused to the vulcanized rubber, the peeling strength between the rubber layer and the polyurethane layer being at least 1.2 kg cm, and a process for production thereof. The article simplifies the process for production of shoes and makes the control of the process of production easy and provides a final product having excellent flexibility, flexing resistnace, friction reistance, oil resistance and cleavage resistance against ozone.
