# Fuser member for electrostatographic copiers.

## Abstract
A fuser member 10 for electrostatographic reproducing apparatus has a rigid core 11 having coated thereon a thin layer 12 of a resiliently compressible material which has a significantly improved pitting resistance and fusing life. This material comprises the crosslinked product of a mixture of about 100 parts by weight alpha omega hydroxypoly dimethylsiloxane, about 230 to 300 parts and preferably 266 parts by weight of finely divided tabular alumina, and about 13 to 60 parts by weight of finely divided iron oxide particles, together with a crosslinking agent and a crosslinking catalyst to promote crosslinking of the siloxane. The crosslinking agent may be 6 to 20 parts by weight condensed tetraethylor thosilicate and the crosslinking catalyst may be 0.25 to 1.8 parts by weight dibutyltin diburate or bis dibutylchlorotin o xide.
