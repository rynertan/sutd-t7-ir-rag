# Improved antisoiling nylon carpet yarns.

## Abstract
Polyamide carpet fibers coated with a certain class of fluorine containing addition polymer are described. The coating is chemically bonded to the fiber surface through amide linkages NHCO of the polyamide. The coating imparts antisoiling properties of a permanent nature to the fibres. Where applied to carpet yarn, the coating has good retention through carpet dyeing operations and does not significantly interfere with the ability of the carpet to take up dye, even in the casse of foam dyeing which is particularly sensitive to fluorocarbon coatings.
