## Abstract
The folding partition system disclosed is composed of a series of panels 2 , and incorporates a hinge post moulding 5 located between each two successive panels. The hinged joint created between the panels features on the one hand, two mating surfaces 9, 12 having a profile in the form of an arc to a circle the radii of which converge on the hinge pin 6 , and on the other, two seals 7, 8 which remain in contact with the mating surfaces when the panels are swung on the hinge posts.
