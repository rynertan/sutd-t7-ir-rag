# MOS SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
In an integrated circuit an output buffer circuit has pull down resistor in a MOS FET formed by inserting pinch off resistor regions which extend from source region and drain region towards a part under the 8 electrode, can be used for direct driving of a high breakdown operation load, such as flourescent numeral indication lamp. The above mentioned forming of the pinch off resistor regions in MOS FET can form a considerable resistance for a small area.
