# PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ETHANOL AND OR ACETALDEHYDE BY THE METAL CATALYSED LIQUID PHASE REACTION OF METHANOL, CARBON MONOXIDE AND HYDROGEN IN THE PRESENCE OF A SOLVENT

## Abstract
A recycle solvent for use in a metal catalysed process for the production of ethanol and or acetaldehyde by the liquid phase reaction of methanol, carbon monoxide and hydrogen is provided. The solvent should i form a single phase with methanol and the liquid products of the process throughout the process 2 be one in which the catalyst and any associated promoters are soluble 3 have a boiling point at atmospheric pressure in excess of 120 C and 4 should be chemically stable under the reaction conditions and not interact in a deliterious manner with either the catalyst or the other components of the reaction. A preferred class of recycle solvent is sulpholane and its substituted derivatives.
