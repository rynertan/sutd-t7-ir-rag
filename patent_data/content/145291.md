# Improvements in sealed beam lamps.

## Abstract
A discharge lamp is provided with a starting aid in the form of a loop of conductive wire arranged around the discharge lamp arc tube and a novel spark gap. A conductive element is electrically connected between the loop and an insulating sleeve adapted to form a spark gap by means of the conductive element wrapped around an opening in the insulating sleeve. The opening can be in the form of a drilled hole or slot and the arrangement is particularly useful in the restricted confines of a sealed beam reflector lamp.
