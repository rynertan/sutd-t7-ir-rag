## Description
METHOD FOR THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF POLY ARYLENE SULFIDE This invention relates to the production of arylene sulfide polymer. In one of its aspects, this invention relates to a method by which the crystallization of poly arylene sulfide which has been prepared using an additive that reduces the melt flow of the polymer, particularly polymer prepared with alkali metal carboxylate, is affected.In another of its aspects, this invention relates to a method for lowering the rate of crystallization of poly arylene sulfide . In yet another of its aspects, this invention relates to the lowering of the melt crystallization temperature Tmc of poly arylene sulfide . In still another aspect of the invention, it relates to end products having improved physical properties that are produced from poly arylene sulfide that is treated by the method of the present invention. Generally in the preparation of poly arylene sulfide , or more particularly poly phenylene sulfide , particulate polymer, after separation from the reaction mixture, is subjected to a series of washing operations to remove residual sodium chloride by product and other, particularly ash producing, contaminants. We have observed that polymer passing through a series of wash operations is subject to an increase in the melt crystallization temperature Tmc . Since the production of end products from poly phenylene sulfide often requires or is benefitted by lower Tmc values than would be obtained after succession of purified water washings, an investigation was initiated to determine the reason for the increase in Tmc.From this investigation, it was found that the removal of polyvalent metal ions by extraction from the polymer in the purified water washes was the cause of the increase in Tmc. It was then discovered that the process could be reversed to bring about a lowering of the Tmc and to provide poly phenylene sulfide with a decreased rate of crystallization. The polymers produced by this treatment were found, when used in film and fiber production, to provide greater processing time for increasing stretch orientation and draw, respectively, because of the slow melt crystallization rate. In the production of molded objects, the slow rate of crystallization was found to prevent internal cracking because more time for stress relaxation is available during cooling. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a method for affecting the crystallization of poly arylene sulfide , more particularly poly phenylene sulfide . It is still another object of this invention to provide polymer of arylene sulfide having a lower melt crystallization temperature Tmc and, therefore, a slower melt crystallization rate than the same polymer would have without being treated by the present process. It is still another object of this invention to provide polymeric end products such as fibers, film, and molded objects which have physical characteristics improved over those characteristics which they would have without being treated by the process of the present invention. Other objects, aspects, and the several advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon a study of the specification and the appended claims.THE INVENTION According to the invention, a method is provided for affecting the crystallization of poly arylene sulfide in which the polymer is treated with mono and polyvalent cations in aqueous solutions at an elevated temperature for a time sufficient to affect the crystallization of the polymer. The manner in which the crystallization is affected can be described as a decrease in the rate of crystallization or as a lowering of the melt crystallization temperature Tmc . In further embodiments of the invention, the crystallization of phenylene sulfide particulate polymer is affected by heating the polymer slurry in an aqueous medium in the presence of at least one water soluble chemical compound selected from metal salts of Groups IA and IIA of thePeriodic Table under conditions of temperature and for a period of time sufficient to reduce the melt crystallization temperature and the rate of crystallization of the polymer. The treatment is normally carried out with purified, particulate resins to expedite contact with the treating agent. The treating step can be carried out with dry resins after it has been purified substantially to remove the contaminants, such as metal halides, organic solvent, metal sulfide, and other impurities which can be present in the crude reaction product. Arylene sulfide polymers, particularly poly phenylene sulfide , that can be employed in the process of this invention include those polymers, generally, which have been prepared by use of a p dihalobenzene, an alkali metal sulfide, an organic amide, and an additive that reduces the melt flow of the polymer produced as compared with the polymers produced without the use of the additive, such as is particularly illustrated by the use of an alkali metal carboxylate as inU.S. Patent No. 3,919,177. Optionally, the polymer can be produced with the above components together with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, e.g., in an amount up to about 0.8 mol of alkali metal hydroxide per mole of alkali metal sulfide and or a polyhaloaromatic compound such as 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene, e.g., in an amount up to about 0.6 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight p dihalobenzene.Lithium halides are alternative additives which can be used to produce polymer of reduced melt flow. If desired, water which can be present with the reactants can be removed by distillation prior to the polymerization reaction. The polymers produced will generally have a melt flow within the range of about 40 to about 150. The particulate resin useful in this invention which is typified by poly phenylene sulfide as made according to U.S. Patent No.3,919,177 can be recovered from the reaction process as a free flowing white powder having a particle size range averaging from about 5 to about 1500 micrometers, generally ranging from about 10 to about 150 micrometers or it can be recovered by merely processes, as a core particulate polymer. Although the process of this invention is applicable to polymers of various particle sizes, the process is more easily carried out with more finely divided particles. It is to be understood that the processes of this invention can be carried out in a number of ways. In one manner of operation, the reaction mass comprising particulate polymer, alkali metal halide, an organic amides can be subjected to suitable separation techniques to recover polymer substantially free of organic amide, unreacted reactants, and alkali metal halides. For example, the polymer can be recovered from the reaction slurry and then combined with water to extract ash forming materials. As has been alluded to above, the amount of impurities removed by water extraction methods certainly affects the degree to which the present inventive treatment will be required. The invention seeks to produce a particulate polymer having a residual mono or polyvalent metal cation content in the range of about 50 to about 5000 ppm, preferably about 100 to about 3000 ppm. The treating agents suitable for this invention are water soluble and are selected from mono and polyvalent metal salts derived from the alkali and alkaline earth metal elements of Periodic Groups IA and IIA since many of these are colorless, water soluble, and relatively inexpensive. Particularly useful are hydroxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals. At present, the preferred compound for use in this invention is calcium oxide or its hydrated form, calcium hydroxide. In accordance with an embodiment of this invention, phenylene sulfide polymer is contacted in an aqueous slurry with at least one chemical treating agent as defined herein at an elevated temperature and for a period of time sufficient to affect the crystallization of the polymer. The effectiveness of the treatment can be assessed by noting the change in the melt crystallization temperature which should be lowered by the treatment. The determination of melt crystallization temperature is well known in the art. The treating to affect the crystallization of the polymer should be carried out at an elevated temperature which is below the melting point of the polymer for a period of time sufficient to decrease the melt crystallization temperature of the polymer. Normally, the contacting will be at least about 3000 F and will not exceed about 250 F below the melting point of the polymer. Ordinarily, the contacting temperature will be in the range of about 3500 F to about 5200 F. The time for treatment or contacting can vary greatly depending on the temperature and the nature of the arylene sulfide polymer. It generally will be within the range of about 5 minutes to about 24 hours, preferably about 30 minutes to about 10 hours. In general, it can be said that the contact time decreases with increasing temperature. The pressure should be sufficient to maintain liquid phase conditions which can range from about 0 to about 1500 psi. Repeated treatments can be employed, if desired, or the process can be carried out in several phases, if desired. The polymer water slurry can consist of about 10 to about 60 weight per cent polymer and more preferably from about 20 to about 50 weight per cent polymer to provide convenient handling and separation factors. After normal purification and drying steps, the resin is left in the particulate size and form at which the process started. As stated above, utilization of finely divided resins will expedite contact with the water and treating agent. The process of this invention can be conducted batchwise or continuously. The heating and contacting of the chemical treating agent can be carried out in conventional equipment. A convenient method for carrying out the process is to contact the polymer slurry with a chemical treating agent in an enclosed tank provided with agitation. The contacting can be carried out in a single vessel or in a plurality of vessels. The polymer can be separated from the slurry after contacting by suitable techniques including pressure reduction, filtration, and the like. The polymer is subsequently dried for further use as desired.Such further uses as extrusion into sheets, extrusion into film, spinning into fiber, or molding into molded objects can be contemplated. The following examples are intended to illustrate the compositions and process of the invention. Example I In this example the preparation of a representative poly phenylene sulfide Ryton commat A resin from a reaction mixture containig sodium sulfide, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone NMP , sodium acetate, water, p dichlorobenzene DCB , and 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene TCB is described. 23.5 lb of sodium acetate and 25.7 gallons of NMP were charged to a necessary RytonE pilot plant reactor, which was then purged three times with nitrogen. An aqueous sodium sulfide solution formed by mixing 72.6 lb of a 50.34 weight NaOH solution and 87.7 lb of a solution containing 58.99 weight NaHS and 0.21 weight Na2S was added to the reactor. Feed lines were flushed with 8.0 gallons of NMP, which was also charged to the reactor. The reactor content was then dehydrated for 90 minutes at 13 psig and a temperature ranging from 3320F initial to about 4500F final . Subsequently 132.9 lb of DCB were charged, and the polymerization reaction was carried out for about 2 hours 20 minutes at a temperature ranging from 4470F initial to 5100F final and a pressure ranging from 30 psig initial to 135 psig final . After one hour at about 5080F, 90 ml of TCB and 2.0 gallons of NiP were added, and the polymerization was continued for 2 more hours at a temperature of about 5090F and a pressure of about 145 psig. Ten gallons of deionized water were charged to the reactor after cooling to accomplish the separation to a molten PPS phase and anNMP containing phase. Thereafter, the reactor mixture was cooled to about 2130F, under a nitrogen pressure of about 100 psig, and was transferred to a dilution tank containing 50 gallons of deionized water.After filtration, the polymer filter cake was washed once with 120 gallons cold deionized water 700F and twice with 80 gallons of hot deionized water 3500F and filtered after each wash. Example II Eight wet poly phenylene sulfide batches prepared and washed in accordance with the procedure described in Example I were treated as follows. Half of each of the wet resin batches was dried at about 200 3000F under atmospheric pressure conditions for about 3 hours and used as control runs. The other half of each batch was treated for about 1 hour with aqueous solutions containing ionic metal compounds in a stirred vessel at 3500F.

Data in Table I show that treatment of wet PPS resin with aqueous solutions of ionic compounds, preferably alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides Runs 1B, 2B, 6B, 7B, 8B results in a substantial lowering of the melt crystallization temperature, Tmc, to about 160 1800C. Metal chlorides do not appear to be effective Run 5B . Ash levels increased, yet generally stayed at acceptable levels of about 0.2 0.7 weight. The flow rate of treated PPS generally decreased, which indicates some crosslinking action of metal ions, particularly divalent ions Ca2 , Mg2 , Boa2 . The characteristic flow rate increase by a factor of about 2 3 of uncured, branched PPS after heat soaking for about 30 minutes vs. flow rate after heating for only 5 minutes was hardly affected by the treatment with dissolved ionic compounds. Example III Eight samples of RytonE A PPS treated with solutions of 526 ppm of calcium oxide in water essentially in accordance with the procedure ofExample II and having a elt crystallization temperature, Tmc see footnote to table I , of 175 1930C, were extruded into films after having been pelletized on a 1 NRM extruder at a die temperature of about 6100F and dried overnight in a Blue M oven at 210 230 F. The extrusion was carried out on a 1 NRM extruder without screens through a 0.010 X 3 slot die having a temperature of 6100F.The extruded film was passed over a pair of heated rolls having a temperature of 1750F and was then taken up. Tmc values of extruded films measured in accordance with the procedure described in Example II ranged from about 1860C to 2040C. The appearance of all eight films was rated 5tf based on the following scale 1 covered with bubbles , 2 many bubbles , 3 bubbles easily noticed , 4 very few small bubbles , 5 no bubbles . Example IV PPS washed with aqueous solutions containing 424 ppm of CaO, essentially in accordance with the procedure of Example II were spun into fibers. The lime washed resin, which had a flow rate of 143 g 10 minutes and a Tmc starting from 3600C see footnote to Table I of 1930C, was vacuum dried overnight at 110 1200C. The water cooled polymer feed was extruded in a 1 Wayne Machine and Die Co. extruder through 60 100 200 Dynalloy XIIL 60 mesh pack screens and a spinneret having 34 holes of 0.048 length and 0.012 diameter. The block temperature was about 3000C, and the polymer extrusion rate was about 13.9 grams per minute. The extruded strand of 34 yellow PPS filaments was drawn over a hot plate at 1000C to a draw ratio of 4.0.
