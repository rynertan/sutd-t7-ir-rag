# Spectrophotometer.

## Abstract
A dual beam spectrophotometer includes signal pro cessing circuitry for producing sample dark and ref dark signals. The dark signals subtracted from the sample and ref signals are the average of the dark signals produced on each side of the sample and ref pulses. The signal processing circuitry may comprise four sample and hold circuits 604 607 which store the sample, ref and first and second dark signals, a resistive combining network R630, R631 for the two dark signals and first 608 and second 609 substractor circuits the first subtractor 608 gives the sample dark signal at its output while the second subtractor 609 gives the ref dark signal at its output.
