# Screenless screw mill.

## Abstract
A new mill is described characterised by the absence of the screen and by a grinding system which simultaneously conveys the material from a point at which the untreated material is fed to the point at which the material reduced to the required particle size is discharged. This grinding system is constituted essentially by a rotating shaft 10 on which grinding elements 8, 14,20,26,43 are fixed in a helical arrangement to form a screw which advances the material in addition to grinding it. The screw pitch is adjusted in such a manner that when the material reaches the discharge port it has attained the required particle size. The type of elements which form the grinding screw is also chosen in accordance with the material to be treated and the degree of grinding to be attained.
