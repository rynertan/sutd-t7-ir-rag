# Magnetic toner powder.

## Abstract
A ferrite powder type magnetic toner used in an elec trophotography. It comprises a resinous component and a ferrite having a spinel structure comprising components of iron oxide at a ratio of 99.9 to 51 mole as Fe₂O₃ and at least one metal oxide selected from the group consisting of manganese oxide, nickel oxide, cobalt oxide, magnesium oxide, copper oxide. zinc oxide and cadmium oxide at a ratio of 0.1 to 49 mole as MO wherein M represents Ni, Co, Mg, Cu, Zn or Cd. A process for producing the ferrite component of said toner, involving the steps of mixing, granulating, sintering and pulverizing, is described.
