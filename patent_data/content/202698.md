## Description
The invention relates to a compound of the general structural formula where R is an alkyl group and M represents a cation. The invention also relates to compositions in which this compound is used as bleaching activator. The earlier, non prepublished European Patent Application No.0166 571 describes a great many bleaching activators, including a few of the general formula RO.CO.OC₆H₄SO₃M, R being only defined in general terms as a C₆ C₂₀ alkyl group. It does not disclose any compounds of the present invention. It should be added that United States Patent Specification No.4 412 934 discloses bleaching activators of the general formula R.CO.OC₆H₄SO₃M, wherein R is a linear alkyl chain containing from about 5 to about 9 carbon atoms. As to these ester compounds it is demonstrated in European Patent Application No.0 120 591 that, under certain conditions, they produce odours in the wash solution which are aesthetically unattractive. It is suggested that this problem be solved by employing similar esters having a non linear aliphatic group R. Another suggestion to solve the same problem is described in United States Patent Specification No.4 486 327, wherein the use is mentioned of certain alpha substituted derivatives of C₆ C₁₈ carboxylic acid esters. As substituents Cl, OCH₃ and OC₂H₅ are disclosed. Those compounds, however, are difficult to prepare. As mentioned above, the compound according to the invention is an effective bleach activator. The compound is therefore advantageously incorporated into a detergent composition which, in addition to the bleach activator, contains a bleaching agent, which under alkaline conditions generates hydrogen peroxide, and a surfactant. Also mixtures of the present compounds may be used to that end. Particularly favourable results are obtained using sodium p sulphophenyl n hexyl carbonate, sodium p sulphophenyl 2 ethylhexyl carbonate, sodium p sulphophenyl n octyl carbonate and the sodium p sulphophenyl carbonates derived from the abovementioned mixtures of Linevol alcohols. In actual practice the detergent composition according to the invention may be in a form varying from powdered to granular and may be prepared by methods known in the art, such as crystallization or spray drying of an aqueous slurry or mechanical mixing of the substances. The bleaching activator according to the invention may be applied as such or while provided on a carrier material. Examples of suitable carrier materials are sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulphate. The invention, however, is not confined to solid detergent compositions but also comprises liquid detergent compositions containing the present bleaching activators. The present bleaching activator may also be added separately, in the form of a detergent additive containing the bleach activator, to aqueous wash liquor containing at least a surfactant and a hydrogen peroxide generating bleaching agent. To this end the bleaching activator may be applied in the form of powder, preferably provided on a carrier, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride or sodium sulphate or in the form of a solution or dispersion. The bleaching activator may also be used in the form of a coated particle examples of suitable coating materials are ethoxylated fatty acids and poly ethylene oxide . Alternatively, the bleaching activator may have been introduced into a sachet or combined with a flexible substrate, as described for acyl group containing bleaching activators in European Patent Application No. Al 120591. Such a detergent additive may also contain mixtures of the present bleaching activators and other active washing agents. As far as the latter agents are concerned it should of course be noted that the choice of them is dependent on the compatibility with the present activator. This is of special importance when the additive is used in the form of a solution or dispersion. The present examples serve to illustrate the invention. All percentages in them are by weight. In this example a description is given of a general procedure used for preparing the present compounds. The table below gives the reaction conditions and the reaction results for three compounds. To a stirred solution in 30 g of water of 0,1 mole of 4 hydroxybenzene sulphonic acid 65 solution in water and 0,2 moles of sodium hydroxide 50 solution in water there was added dropwise over a period of 10 25 minutes 0,1 mole of alkylchloroformate at a temperature not higher than 40 C. Subsequently, the temperature of the reaction mixture was increased. After termination of the reaction 50 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride were added, after which the product was filtered off and dried at 120 C. In a similar manner p sulphophenyl n octyl carbonate compound 4 was prepared, starting from 2 moles of 4 hydroxybenzene sulphonic acid. The reaction temperature and reaction time employed were 80 C and 1,5 h, respectively the product obtained had a sulphonate content of 97,3 and was isolated in a yield of 70,8 . The compounds 1, 2 and 3 were tested for their bleach activating action as follows. The value found was compared with that determined on a non washed piece of cloth and the difference expressed in the value ΔR the higher this value, the better the bleaching action and, hence, the effectiveness of the activator. Further of compounds 1, 2 and 3 the bleach activating action was tested in the above described manner and in the presence of different amounts of a surfactant mixture containing 80 of a linear alkyl benzene sulphonate and 20 of an ethoxylated 11EO fatty alcohol. The aqueous solutions with which the pieces of test cloth were treated contained per litre 1 g of sodium percarbonate corresponding to 8,4 mmoles of hydrogen peroxide , 2 g of sodium tripolyphosphate, 0,5 g of sodium disilicate, 0,25 g of a 25 solution in water of ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid pentasodium salt Dequest 2046, a commercial product of Monsanto and 1,7 mmoles of the compounds 1, 2 or 3. The pH of the solutions was 9,5 9,9 and the treating temperature 40 C. The amount of surfactant was 0, 0,35 or 0,70 g per litre. The ΔR values found for these three different amounts were, respectively Use being made of the same procedure as described in Example 2, the activator action of sodium p sulphophenyl 2 ethylhexyl carbonate compound No. 2 in the presence of a standard detergent was determined as a function of time and temperature. The standard detergent was of the following composition 8 sodium linear alkyl average C₁₁¼ Imidial Grün pieces of cloth of 7 9 cm were treated for 10, 20 and 30 minutes at 40 C and 60 C with 150 ml of an aqueous 9 GH solution containing per litre 5,16 g of the standard detergent, 0,69 g of sodium perborate corresponding to 8,75 mmoles of hydrogen peroxide , 0,25 g of Dequest 2046 and 1,68 mmoles of bleaching activator. The pH of the solution was 10,12. The values found for ΔR were successively In a comparative experiment the values found for sodium p sulphophenyl ethyl carbonate, an activator according to U.S. Patent Specification No. 3 272 750 were Using an analogous procedure as described in Example 3, three sodium p sulphophenyl alkyl carbonates according to the invention compounds 1, 2 and 4 were compared for their bleach activating action with sodium p sulphophenyl ethyl carbonate and sodium p sulphophenyl n butyl carbonate, both activators according to U.S. Patent Specification No. 3 272 750. The results in the Table clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the bleaching activators according to the invention as compared with that of the prior art activators.
