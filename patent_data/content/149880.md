# NON WOVEN WEBS OF SYNTHETIC FIBRES CONSOLIDATED BY MEANS OF CARBOXYLATED STYRENE BUTADIENE LATICES, AND DISPOSABLE ARTICLES MADE THEREFROM

## Abstract
A non woven web of synthetic fibre s is characterized by consolidating optionally impregnating the web option ally a dry web with a binder optionally a sole binder substantially comprising a polymer or a latex, provided by polymerizing from about 42 to about 68 parts by weight of a monoaromatic vinyl or vinylidene monomer which may be unsubstituted or substituted by a C₁ ₄ alkyl radical, or a chlorine or bromine atom from about 30 to about 58 parts by weight of a C₄ ₈ conjugated diolefin preferably a C₄ ₆ conjugated diolefin and from about 0.5 to about 8.0 parts by weight of a C₃ ₆ ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. The resultant web can have improved tensile strength in a cross machine direction.
