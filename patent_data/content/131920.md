# Controlled temperature expansion in oxygen production by molten alkali metal salts.

## Abstract
A continuous process is set forth for the production of oxygen from an oxygen containing gas stream, such as air, by contacting a feed gas stream with a molten solution of an oxygen acceptor to oxidize the acceptor and cyclically regene rating the oxidized acceptor by releasing oxygen from the acceptor wherein the oxygen depleted gas stream from the contact zone is treated sequentially to temperature reduction by heat exchange against the feed stream so as to condense out entrained oxygen acceptor for recycle to the process, combustion of the gas stream with fuel to elevate its tempera ture and expansion of the combusted high temperature gas stream in a turbine to recover power.
