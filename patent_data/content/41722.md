# Photoflash array with selective pairing of lamps and switching of common circuit.

## Abstract
A photoflash lamp array having a plurality of 2n flash lamps 21 30 , a plurality of n selective terminal means 11 15 , each associated with a respective pair of the lamps and connected to one lead in wire 21a 30a of each of the lamps of the associated pair, and a common terminal 10 associated with all of the 2n lamps but directly connected to the other lead in wire 21b 30b of one lamp of each pair. A respective normally open switch 31 35 is coupled between the com mon terminal 10 and a lead in wire 22b, 24b, 26b, 28b, 30b of the other lamp of each pair, so that the n normally open switches are coupled between the common circuit lead in wires of associated pairs of the 2n lamps. Each of the switches is responsive to the flashing of the directly connected lamp of an associated pair so as to electrically connect the other lamp of the pair to the common terminal. In one specific example, ten lamps are selectively paired to be operated sequentially by firing pulses successively applied to five selective termi nals together with a common terminal.
