# HALOACETYL DERIVATIVES OF AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS

## Abstract
New compounds which are 4,4 bis trihaloacetyl derivatives of aromatic compounds have been prepared by reacting an aromatic compound with a haloacetyl halide in the presence of a Friedel Crafts catalyst, such as AlClâ‚ƒ, in a suitable solvent. The compounds are useful in preparing polycarbonates, polyesters, polyamides, polyketones and polyurethanes.
