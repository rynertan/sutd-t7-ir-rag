## Description
Description Optical Encoder Using Time Domain MultiplexingTechnical Field This invention relates to optical encoders, and more particularly to time domain multiplexed fiber optic encoders.Background Art Optical encoders utilizing fiber optics are well known in the art, such devices providing optical interrogation and readout of information encoded on an optical mask. The information is imprinted on the mask in the form of multiple binary signal bits with the binary state characterized by the light transmissive or opaque state of the associated signal bit locations between two major surfaces of the mask. The transparent signal bits provide a complete light transmission path between the surfaces of the mask from a light source, such as a light emitting diode LED or laser diode LD which provide the light to the associated bit through a fiber optic path or waveguide, to a light receiver, such as an optical detector which receives the light through a similar fiber optic path.The opaque regions provide interruption of the light path. The light transmission, or non transmission through the mask determines the particular signal bit logic state, i.e. one or zero. In the simplest embodiment, for a mask having anN number of signal bits there are N light sources andN light receivers, each with its associated fiber optic path. The sources and detector are arranged in pairs, one pair dedicated to each signal bit location. The number of light sources and associated fiber optic paths can be reduced by using a single light source of appropriate intensity to illuminate all of the signal bits at one time, with the presence or absence of light through individual signal bit locations being determined by individual light detectors associated with each bit. Alternatively a single light receiver and path may be used with N number of separate light sources the individual light sources being sequenced to discriminate between signal bit locations.In this manner the number of light sources or light receivers, together with their fiber optic paths, may be reduced to one but not both. Signal multiplexing may be used to reduce the number of both light sources and receivers to less thanN as disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,117,460, of common assignee herewith, issued to Walworth et al. As shown by Walworth et al, the N signal bit locations of the mask are connected through N fiber optic paths to light receivers and light detectors arranged so as to provide, in effect, a square matrix of equal rows and columns one light source for each column and one light detector for each row. Each source is activated to provide column illumination and the light detectors are polled to detect the presence or absence of light at particular signal bit row location.This reduces both the number of sources and receivers required, although it does not permit use of a single light source with a single light receiver, nor does it reduce the number of fiber optic paths required to provide light transmission to the N signal bit locations of the mask.Disclosure of Invention Objects of the present invention include providing an optical encoder having the absolute minimum number of both light sources and light receivers, together with a proportionate reduction in the number of fiber optic paths required for transcribing signal information encoded in the form of light transmissive or opaque regions in each of a plurality of parallel signal bit locations between two major surfaces of an optical mask. According to the present invention, an optical encoder transcribes the imprint of the signal information on the mask into a serial signal bit stream by time domain multiplexing a single light pulse, i.e. a primary pulse is divided into a temporal array of secondary light pulses, one for each signal bit location, each presented in timed sequence to the associated parallel bit location at a first major surface of the optical mask in a related one of successive pulse window time intervals the timed transmission of each secondary pulse through the mask parallel bit locations are multiplexed into a real time serial signal stream of light pulses and presented to an optical receiver which provides a signal manifestation in response to the presence of each secondary pulse, the presence or absence of a signal manifestation in each successive pulse window time interval providing a serial signal representation of the mask encoded information. In further accord with the present invention, the temporal array of secondary light pulses is provided by dividing the primary light pulse from the source into a plurality of secondary light pulses in an optical power splitter which provides each of the secondary pulses simultaneously to an associated one of a plurality of fiber optic delay lines, the delay lines providing successively, from a first line associated with a first bit location on the mask to a last line associated with a last bit location on the mask, increased propagation time delays so as to provide the plurality of equal time spaced secondary light pulses at the outputs thereof, from a first pulse to a last pulse corresponding to the signal bit locations of the mask. In still further accord with the present invention the primary light pulse is provided at a selected real time pulse width T and the delay lines comprise dif ferent length fiber optic waveguides of the same material, each succeeding waveguide, from a first one to a last one, being longer than a preceding waveguide by a length corresponding to at least one spatial pulse width as determined by the product of the real time pulse width T and the group velocity of the light pulses in the particular fiber optic material. The optical encoder of the present invention allows the use of a single light source, a single receiver, and the fiber optic paths associated with each, to transpose encoded information from a plurality of signal bit locations on an optical mask. The conversion of the parallel signal bit information on the mask into a serial stream of time spaced light pulses further allows the transcribed information to be transmitted to the light detector over a single, common waveguide. This provides both a reduction in the number of required fiber optic paths and also a significant increase in encoder reliability due to the fact that disruption of the serial signal caused by waveguide failure provides total interruption of the signal and, therefore, an absolute indication of failure. This is in contrast to the loss of individual signal bits as may occur in the prior art devices where parallel transmission occurs over multiple fibers and signal error is not readily obvious. These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in the light of the following detailed description of an exemplary embodiment thereof, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing. Brief Description of Drawing Fig. 1 is a simplified perspective illustration, not to scale, of the optical encoder of the present invention as used in combination with a fiber optic position sensor Fig. 2 is a simplified, system block diagram of the optical encoder of the present invention Fig. 3 is an illustration of the operating characteristics of the optical encoder of Figs. 1, 2 and Fig. 4 is an illustration of an alternative embodiment of one element used in the optical encoder ofFig. 2.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention Referring to Fig. 1, in a perspective illustration of the optical encoder of the present invention as may be used in a fiber optic position sensor of the type disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,116,000, of common assignee herewith, issued to Martin et al, a position sensor code plate 10 is attached through a mechanical connector 12 and shaft 14 to the device whose position is to be sensed, allowing the code plate to be displaced through a light transmission path established between a light transmitting block 16 and light receiving block 18. The code plate includes an optical mask 20 encoded with a plurality of signal bit locations 24 27 which, for the selected Gray code illustrated, corresponds to a plurality N of signal channels.The Gray code provides signal information of the linear displacement at granularity intervals AX and, for a given stationary position of the mask in the light transmission path, provides a unique optical signal code by virtue of the transparent or opaque regions presented by the signal bit in each channel. It should be understood that although illustrated for use with a linear fiber optic position sensor the optical encoder of the present invention is not limited to such use, and may be used with any type of encoded optical mask, including angle measuring masks. The transmitting and receiving blocks each include an equal plurality of light ways, which represent the termination of fiber optic paths in each block. The light ways are disposed on the face of each block in a linear array, along an axis coincident with the signal bit locations to be read from the optical mask. The transmitting block includes light ways 28 31, each in registration with an associated one of the signal bit locations 24 27. The receiving block light ways not shown in Fig. 1 are similarly arrayed, such that each receiving block light way is in registration with a counterpart located in the transmitting block and light from the transmitting block light ways is received by the associated receiving light way in the absence of interruption of the particular light path. The description thus far is typical of prior art encoders, and particularly those used in combination with a fiber optic position sensor of the type disclosed by Martin et al. In the optical encoder of the present invention a single pulsed light source 34 and single light receiver 36 are used to provide full transposition of the mask encoded information into an optical signal. The pulsed light source is turned on in response to a gate signal provided on lines 38 from control and signal conditioning circuitry 40, described in detail hereinafter with respect to Fig. 2, and when gated on provides a light pulse of intensity I, with a real time pulse width T determined by the duration of the applied gate signal.The source light pulse, or primary pulse is transmitted through a single fiber optic path, or waveguide 42 to an optical power splitter 44 which divides the light intensity of the source pulse into N number of secondary light pulses corresponding to the number of signal bit locations to be transcribed from the optical mask. In Fig. 1,N 4 signal bit locations 24 through 27 , however, any number of secondary pulses may be provided with a light source of sufficient intensity and multiple port splitters, such as star couplers of the type known in the art for use in optical communication systems for providing radial distribution of multiplexed, data bus optical signals as disclosed byT. G. Giallorenzi in a paper entitled OpticalCommunications Research and. Technology Fiber Optics,Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 66, No. 7, July 1978. The secondary iight pulses have a spatial pulse width, i.e. the spatial distance occupied by the source light pulse of real time pulse width T propagating at the group velocity V through the optical g waveguide 42. As known the group velocity is equal to Vg Cng where C is the velocity of light in free space, or 3 x 108 meters and ng is the group refraction for the material media core and cladding of the waveguide. In the absence of dispersion the spatial pulse width P is equal to P T Vg For the short length runs of waveguides used in the present encoder the dispersion effects are negligible.Each secondary light pulse has a spatial pulse width equal to that of the source pulse, and each are presented simultaneously from the star coupler 44 to one end of an associated one of a plurality N of optical delay lines 46 49, the other ends of which are terminated in an associated one of the light ways 28 31 of the transmitter block 16. The delay lines are fiber optic waveguides of the same material, but of different length. The line lengths L increase successively, beginning with a first delay line 46 to the last, or Nth line 49 , in successive, substantially equal increment length values AL . For a line 46 length Lot the length of the next line 47 is L1 to AL, the line 48 has a length L2 L1 AL, and so on up to. the last line of length i LN 1 AL. This incremental length AL is selected to provide at least one full spatial pulse width between successive delay lines, and is typically twice the spatial pulse width of the secondary optical pulses.. For a primary, or source pulse having a real time bandwidth of T 10 nanoseconds and propagating through a doped fused quartz silicon dioxide fiber optic waveguide having a group index of refraction of 1.46 the group velocity is 2.05 x 108 meters, the spatial pulse width is 2.05 sec meters, and the value of AL is on the order of 4 meters.The AL value is selected to provide sufficient temporal separation of the secondary light pulses at the face of the transmitting block 16, such that the higher the value of AL the greater the time separation between adjacent pulses. Referring now to Fig. 3, in a simplified, time based illustration of the time domain multiplexing for the optical encoder of the present invention, the primary light pulse 60 with real time pulse width T is divided by the star coupler 44, Fig. 1 into N secondary pulses 62 65 which are presented simultaneously to the inputs of the associated delay lines 46 49 Figs. 1, 3 . The line lengths for the lines 46 49 are illustrated as Lo through Ln, each succeeding line being longer than the immediately preceding line in the array by the value AL. As a result the propagation time for eac secondary pulse increases with succeeding delay lines by a real time increment T L. Vg For the first line 46, the secondary pulse 62 is incident 62a at the light way 28 of the transmitting block 16 at time tl. In the presence of a light transmissive path through the associated signal bit location 24, the pulse propagates through the code plate 10 and is incident 62b at the receiver block 18. The pulse 63 on the line 47 is incident 63a at the transmitter light way 29 at time t2, where t2 tl hT1, the time duration of the pulse window interval, i.e. the difference time delay between successive delay lines.For the assumed opaque region of signal bit location 25 the pulse is prevented from propagating through the mask to the receiver within the AT3 pulse window interval, the upper limit of which t3 is the time that the succeeding pulse 64 is incident 64a at the light way 30 and propagates through the mask bit location 26 to the receiving block. If the presence or absence of a light pulse at the receiver is designated 1 or 0, then for intervalsAT1 AT3 the received intelligence is 101. Each succeeding pulse similarly appears at the face of the transmitting block in successive, equal AT intervals and, depending on the encoded signal bit location associated with each either appears at the receiver or is blocked by the code plate.The light incident at the receiver, therefore, appears as a real time series signal of light pulses in the nature of a serial signal bit stream, where the presence or absence of a light pulse in a given time interval provides a manifestation of the signal state of the associated one of the signal bit locations. The position of a given pulse in the serial stream beginning with the first pulse 62b , together with the known value AT intervals in which the presence or absence of a light pulse should occur, allows for immediate identification of the signal state of each signal bit location. Since the information encoded on the code plate 10 is in binary form transparent or opaque the series light pulses appear directly in binary form, as illustrated by the table of Fig. 3. Referring again to Fig. 1, the light pulses received at the light ways of the receiving block 18 are transported in parallel through an associated one of the signal bi t fiber optic waveguides 80 83 to a common junction, or connector 86. Each of the signal bit waveguides are of essentially equal length and provide an equal transport time delay for each pulse, such that. successive, received pulses appear at the connector at essentially the same AT pulse window intervals. The connector couples the received pulses as they appear on the parallel signal bit waveguides into a single, common waveguide 88 and these two elements together function as a signal combiner which multiplexes each pulse propagating through the mask into the serial optical pulse signal illustrated inFig. 3. The waveguide 88 presents the serial signal to the light receiver 36. The actual configuration of the signal combiner, i.e. the combination junction and common fiber optic waveguide 88, may be provided in a number of different element configurations, which are selectable based on the particular applied use of the encoder. These include the use of a star coupler for the connector 86 in combination with a single channel, single fiber waveguide 88 , or the use of a simple connector 86 which connects the signal bit waveguides either to a single channel multiple fiber waveguide 88, or to a single channel single fiber waveguide 88 having a fiber corerdiameter which is. large enough to allow light registration with all of the signal bit waveguide cores. In each of these configurations the parallel received pulses are converted into the serial light pulse stream which is presented to the detector. Referring now to Fig. 2, in a block diagram ii lustration of the present optical encoder the control and signal conditioning circuitry 40 Fig. 1 includes control logic 80 responsive to a clock 82 which provides the system time base. The control logic provides gate signals on a line 38a included within the lines 38 Fig. 1 together with the voltage excitation from a voltage source 84 provided on lines 38bur to the pulsed light source, or optical transmitter 34 Fig. 1 . The gate signals are at a selected pulse repetition frequency PRF and real time pulse width T .For delay line AL values providing a plural number M of spatial pulse width intervals of delay between successive secondary light pulses, the resultant time separation, or pulse window time interval AT MT and the signal bit frequency F 1 . The total cycle time for an N signal bit 7T I encoder Ts NAT and the PRF T . For the assumed T 10 nanoseconds ns and a two spatial pulse width separation between delay lines M 2 , the pulse window time interval AT 20 nanoseconds and the signal bit frequency F 50x106 bits per second 50 MBps .For a twelve signal bit encoder N 12 the cycle time Ts 240 ns and the PRF is approximately 4.2 MHz. The frequency of the clock 84 is selected to provide a time base interval equal to the pulse window time interval AT. This time base signal is provided on a line 86 from the control logic 82 to anN bit shift register 88 which, as described hereinafter, may provide serial to parallel conversion of the series electrical pulse signal provided by the optical receiver. The light source pulsed output is provided through single channel waveguide 42 to the transmitter portion 90 of the time domain multiplexer 92 this portion includes the star coupler 44 and the delay lines 46 49, Fig. 1 which in combination provide the temporal array of secondary light pulses. In applications where the mask encoded information is provided in higher order bit counts, i.e. greater number of signal bit locations, the transmitter portions may include multiple star couplers or optical power splitters, which allow for a reduction in the total length of optic fiber required for the delay lines.This may be important from the standpoint of encoder size since the AL lengths are in multiple numbers of meters such that the NL lengths may become excessive.This alternate embodiment of the transmitter portion is shown in Fig. 4 where the primary pulse from the waveguide 42 is input to a first optical signal splitter 96 of the alternate embodiment transmitter 9ova. The splitter divides the primary pulse in two and provides a first divided pulse through a waveguide 98 of lengthLA to the input of a second splitter, or star coupler N 100.The star coupler 100 has N2 outputs, each con nected to an associated one of N2 delay lines 102 104 of increasing AL values from a first line 102 of length L0 to the last line 104 having a length L0 N2l AL. A second pulse from the splitter 96 is coupled through waveguide 106 having a length LB LA N . L. to a star coupler 108 the trans 2 port delay for the second pulse, from the second output of the splitter 96 to the star coupler 108, is equal to the time delay of the last delay line 106 of the first star coupler plus the line length LA of the first waveguide 98. The second star coupler 108 N also has 2 outputs, each connected to an associated one of the delay lines 110 through 112, where the absolute lengths of the lines 110 112 are equal to the lines 102 through 2 04. This allows for a significant reduction in total fiber optic lengths, the absolute savings being dependent on the number N of bits and the selected number M of spatial pulse widths of separation, i.e. AL. The outputs from the transmitter portion 90 are presented through the transmitter block 16 to the mask 20. The secondary pulses propagating through the mask are incident at the receiver block 18 and presented to the receiver portion 114 of the multiplexer 92. The receiver portion includes the signal bit fiber optic waveguides 80 83, the optical connector 86, and the common, single channel waveguide 88 the connector 86 and waveguide 88 comprising the optical signal combiner which may be provided in any of the element combinations described hereinbefore. The output of the receiver portion is the real time serial signal stream of light pulses which is presented through the waveguide 88 to the optical detector 36. The optical detector transduces the light intensity of each received secondary pulse into a proportional magnitude voltage signal which is presented through lines 116 to the control circuit 40, and received at a threshold detector 118, of a type known in the art. The threshold voltage limits are selectable, and are established for the particular application. The signal output from the detector, which is a series pulse stream, may be signal conditioned within the general threshold detection circuitry to provide any selected signal processor compatible format.The output signal pulses from the threshold detector are presented through lines 120 to the input of the shift register 88 which shifts in the signal at the input in succeeding AT intervals as established by the clock signal on a line 86 the presence or absence of a pulse in each interval corresponding to a one or zero logic state respectively. In this manner the appearance of the signal at the output from the threshold detector is uniquely defined as associated with a known AT interval beginning with the first interval corresponding to the first secondary pulse of the temporal array presented to the optical mask assembly. This allows identification of the presence or absence of a signal within a given AT interval as being associated with a given one of the signal bit locations of the optical mask. The synchronization of the AT time base on the lines 88 with the pulse window time intervals for the temporal array of secondary pulses is provided for the particular application by clearing and inhibiting the shift register for a fixed transport time delay, defined as the time interval between the pulsed turn on of the light source 34 and the time at which the secondary pulse associated with the first signal hit location of the mask may be expected to appear at the output of the threshold detector. This is achieved by the control logic 80 which enables the shift register with a gate signal on the line 122 at the end of the transport time delay following the gate on of the light source.The shift register, which may include a number of shift registers in cascade depending on the total number of signal bits to be decoded, provides the transcribed data from the N number of signal locations as N bits of information, from a least significant bit LSB to a most significant bit MSB , which is provided on the lines 41 Fig. 1 as the output from the optical card reader. The present optical encoder allows for the reduction of the number of required light sources, light receivers, and fiber optic paths to an absolute minimum through the use of passive time domain multiplexing in which a single source light pulse is used to optically encode signal information from a plurality of signal bit locations on an optical mask. The light source and receiver may be remotely located from the multiplexer and mask, with the interconnection between them being provided by single channel fiber optic waveguides for the source and receiver. As such the present encoder may be ideally suited for use with a position sensor which, in engine control applications, must be located in a hostile temperature and vibration environment the passive optical multiplexer being ca pale of withstanding temperature and vibration extremes. The encoder elements are those which are known in the art. The star couplers required are similar to those presently used in optical communication systems.The light sources and light receivers required are also available, with the particular device selected, being dependent on the light intensity and light sensitivity requirements of the particular application the light sources including light emitting diodes LED and CW or pulsed laser diodes, and the light receivers including an avalanche photqdiode APD or a PIN diode. Similarly the electronic control circuitry for converting the comparatively high frequency 50 MBps optical bit rate into an equivalent, processor compatible format is similar to that which is presently used in optical telecommunications, as described in a paper by T. L. Maione et al entitled Practical 45 MBps Regenerator for Lightwave Transmission TheBell Systems Technical Journal, Vol. 57, July August 1978, Pps 1837 1856. Although the invention has been shown and described with respect to illustrated embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and various other changes, omissions and additions in the form and detail thereof may be made therein without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention.
