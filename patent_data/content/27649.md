# Protective atmosphere process for annealing and or spheroidizing ferrous metals.

## Abstract
Methanol and nitrogen are injected into a furnace utilized for annealing or spheroidizing metal articles. The methanol reacts inside the furnace to provide an atmosphere with a carbon potential that will minimize or prevent carbon removal or carbon addition to the surface of the ferrous metals being treated.
