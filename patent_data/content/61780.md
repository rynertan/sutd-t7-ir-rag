# ROTATING SEAL FOR CENTRIFUGES

## Abstract
A rotating seal for a continuous flow centrifuge is disclosed. The rotating seal is mounted at the center of mass of the rotor to reduce vibration of the seal. The nonrotating portion of the rotating seal is maintained in contact with the rotating portion of the seal by a three point spring secured to a housing which is resiliently mounted to the chamber which encloses the rotor. In this manner, the nonrotating disk is able to follow the reduced amplitude vibrations of the rotating disk with reduced leakage.
