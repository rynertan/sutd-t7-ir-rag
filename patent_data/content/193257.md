## Description
DESCRIPTION CONTROL OF MICRO ORGANISMS IN WATER ONTAINING COMPOSITIONS. The present invention relates to the control of micro organisms in water containing compositions. Many water containing compositions, such as detergents, solutions, emulsions, suspensions or gels, are difficult to preserve. Such compositions include liquid detergents, cutting emulsions, adhesives, paints, thickener solutions, shampoos, fabric softeners and foam baths. The water containing compositions may contain viable bacteria, yeasts and moulds. These microbes can multiply and the colonies formed can degrade and spoil the product, such spoilage being evident as changes 9n odour, colour or consistency of the product. Such problems also occur in industrial cooling water systems. Excessively high concentrations of microbes in the composition can become a health hazard. For instance, one of the most common contaminants is the highly adaptable bacterium Pseudononas aeruginosa which is a known causative organism of eye infections, and, as such, would not be welcome in a shampoos Many compounds have been used as antimicrobial preservatives in toiletry, household and industrial water containing products. Some are unsuitable for widespread use, one reason being that they are toxic hazards.The rest, such as methyl 4 hydroxybnzoate and sodium benzoate, are widely accepted as antimicrobial preservatives but, whilst they are effective against fungi and Gram positive bacteria, they are relatively inactive against Gram negative bacteria, for example Pseudmonas, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Flavobacterium, and Serratia marcescens.The problem of microbial contamination and spoilage is especially acute in those compositions which are not heated during production, since water borne Gramnegative bacteria may then survive the manufacturing process, so allowing these chemically resistant bacteria to grow in the end product. An object of the present invention is to provide a method of preserving water containing products such as that preservative activity against Gram negative bacteria is as great as activity against other micro organism. A further object is to provide a method of preserving water containing products in which the active stabilizer is stable for long periods. A still further object is to provide such a method in which the active stabilization has low toxicity levels. it has now been found that a series of aromatic compounds which have properties controlling Gram posictxve bacteria and fungi are at least equally as effective against Gram negative bacteria such as those illustrated above. According to the present invention there is provided a method of preventing the growth of fungi and bacteria including Gram negative bacteria in water containing compositions by the addition to the composition, as an agent for the control of Gramnegative bacteria, of one or more compounds of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein X represents CHO or a mannic base, represented by EMI3.1 in which R1 and R2 each represent an alkyl group preferably containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms , or, together with an oxygen atom form the residue of anN morpholinyl ring,EMI3.2 A represents fluorine, bromine, chlorine, iodine, an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a hydroxy group, a nitro group, a primary amino group or hydrogen B represents. fluorine, bromine, chlorine, iodine, an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a hydroxy group, a nitro group, a primary amino group, or hydrogen provided that when X is a mannic base only one ofA and B may be hydrogen. Preferably in all cases only one of A and B are hydrogen. In general from about 0.01 to about 0.6 by weight of the control agent based on the total weight of the water containing composition may be used, although larger amounts are not excluding for any specific product. Preferably from 0.02 to 0.2X by weight of the control agent based on the total weight of the water containing composition is used. The control agent of the present invention may be added to or incorporated in the water containing composition as such but, especially when the control agent is normally a solid material it may be added in the form of a solution of appropriate concentration in a suitable solvent which is compatible with the watercontaining composition. Thus, in the case of 3, 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde DCHB a solution of DCHB is monopropylene glycol comprising 30 parts by weight DCHB to 70 parts by weight monopropylene glycol can be used. It has been found that compounds of the above general formula, especially DCHB have the advantage of retaining antimicrobial activity in the presence of proteins, such as serum and soluble collagen, whereas many currently available antimicrobial agents are significantly inactivated by proteins. It is important that preservatives added to toiletry, household and pharmaceutical products have a low order of toxicity. The toxicological data which has so far been accumulated on DCHB, as an example of compounds of the above general formula, is extremely favourable as exemplified by an acute oral toxicity LD5o in rats of greater than 5 g kg body weight. It has further been found that compounds of the above general formula, especially DCHB, have excellent stability. Samples of shampoos, aqueous solutions and creams with and without addition of DCHB at 0.35 w w have been stored at 250C, in the light and in dark, for seven months and have been assessed for visual colour change and for DCHB content, by UV analysis, at regular intervals. In that time no colour changes have been noted and there has been no significant change in UV absorption readings. The present invention also includes the use of one or more compounds of the general formula EMI5.1 wherein X, A and B have the meanings defined hereinbefore in the preparation of a medicament for use in the control of bacteria especially gram negative bacteria upon skin especially human skin by the application of said medicament to the skin. Examples of such compounds which are effective in preventing the growth of Gram negative bacteria include 1. 3 ,5 pibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde EMI5.2 2. 3,5, Dimethyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehydeEMI5.3 3. 3 Chloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehydeEMI6.1 4. 3,5 Dimethoxy 4 hydroxybenzaldehydeEMI6.2 5. 2,6 Dimethoxy 4 N morpholinyl methyl phenolEMI6.3 6. 3,5 Dichloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehydeEMI6.4 These compounds are also useful in controlling the growth of fungi and Gram positive bacteria. Although the compounds of the above general formula used in the method of the invention do have a controlling effect on Gram positive bacteria and fungi, they may be used in conjunction with other anti microbial agents effective against gram positive bacteria and fu ngi, e.g. yeasts and moulds such as methyl 4 hydroxybenzoate. It has also been found that potentiators of antimicrobial activity such a8 cheating agents e.g. citric acid or ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid can also be effective in combination with compounds of the above general formula as used in the method of the present invention. Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the following Examples. EXAMPLE 1 sodium laurel ether sulphate SLES is a commonly used anionic detergent, a major active component of shampoos,. foam baths and general purpose cleaners.The bactericidal activity of some compounds covered by the general formula given above was evaluated at final levels of 0.10 w w and 0.15 w w in a 27 active solution of SLES confirmed as containing no other preservatives . The activity of these compounds was evaluated in comparison with 0.305 methyl 4 hydroxybenzoate and an unpreserved control sample. The test organisms were three species of resistantGram negative bacteria which had previously been isolated from contaminated detergent products. 20g portions of test solutions were inoculated with 0.1 ml pure culture of the test bacteria and the time taken to achieve a total lethal effect against each species was determined by sub culture at regular intervals into sterile dilution media containing preservative inactivators and then into sterile Nutrient Broth, which was incubated for 4 days at 32 0C to determine the presence or absence of surviving bacteria.
