# Improved bead breaker mechanism for a tyre changer machine.

## Abstract
The bead breaker is comprised of two blades 50,140 held in immobile spaced relation relative one to the other, the two blades defining two spaced working faces in a common plane adapted to lie flush against the bead area 18 of a tire 14 when the two blades are butted against a rim s flange in initial set up position prior to breaking the tire s bead away from the rim. The blades 36,37 are preferably formed from curved plates having a common curvature axis 75 that axis being angled relative to the median plane 35 of the rim 13 in a direction away from the rim s center when the two blades are butted against the rim s flange 17 in the set up position. The curvature of the blades 36,37 preferably is such that no point on the rim edge of each blade is spaced away from the rim s flange a distance greater than about two times the tire s bead core 90 diameter when the blades are butted against the rim s flange in set up relation. The bead breaker blades are swingably connected to a power unit 39 for moving the blades between storage and use positions. The bead breaker mechanism 10 and power unit 39 are structured so that, in use, the bead breaker blades are drawn from the set up posi tion toward the rim s center plane in a generally linear and radially inward directed fashion without the blades being latched to the tire s rim and without contact of the blades with the rim. At maximum extension of the bead breaker blades by the power unit, the working faces of the blades are entirely located radially inward of the rim s flange 17 .
