# Improved reciprocating thermal actuator.

## Abstract
A reciprocating thermal actuator system with hydraulic coupling to hydraulic motion output such as a motor is powered through cooling or alternatively heating of a ther mal expansible liquid contained within respective chambers of ring shaped cross section, the heating and cooling provi sions being integral with the unit and adaptable for either natural or artificial heating and cooling details of a ther malswitch in two embodiments and of an electrical system synchronizing the heating are disclosed.
