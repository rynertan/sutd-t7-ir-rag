# Power supply circuit for an alkali vapor lamp.

## Abstract
The output of an alkali vapor lamp 14 for use in an optical pumping system is stabilized by use of a feedback circuit 18 which regulates current flow from a power supply 10 to an electronic power oscillator 12 used to excite the alkali vapor lamp. Starting of the alkali vapor lamp is facilitated by increasing supply current to the oscillator 12 until the alkali vapor lamp is lit.
