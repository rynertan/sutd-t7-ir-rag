# MOUNTING DEVICE FOR CONDUITS CONNECTED TO A FUEL TANK OF A VEHICLE

## Abstract
A mounting device 22 for a conduit 12, 14, 16 connected to a vehicle fuel tank 10 includes a fixed holding member 24 provided with a groove 32 . The holding member 24 is resiliently deformable so that the width of the groove 32 can be increased. The original width of the groove 32 is smaller than that of the conduit. The conduit is forcedly pressed into the groove so as to be firmly held by the holding member.
