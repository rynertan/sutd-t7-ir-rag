# Refrigerant compositions.

## Abstract
A composition useful as a refrigerant comprising a mixture of bromotrifluoromethane R 13B1 and 1,1 difloroethane R 152a . A compressor 1 compresses the gaseous refrigerant mixture into a condenser 2 where the refrigerant mixture liquifies giving off heat which is distributed to the inside of a house by means of a fan 3 . Liquid refrigerant mixture leaving condenser 2 is throttled through an expansion device 4 . In an evaporator 5 , refrigerant mixture evaporates, taking up heat from the air being blown over the evaporator 5 by a fan 6 . A part of the refrigerant mixture will remain liquid at low outside temperatures and will collect in a reservoir 7 . The device employs a J shaped exit tube 8 having a capillary opening 9 at its lowest point for returning liquid refrigerant and oil to the circuit.
