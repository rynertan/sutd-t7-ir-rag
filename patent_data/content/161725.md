# Container filled with metallic mercury, to be used in the manufacture of mercury vapour discharge lamps and method of manufacturing a mercury vapour discharge lamp by using said container.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a mercury vapour discharge lamp, in which use is made of a lamp vessel 1 provided with an exhaust tube 6 , the quantity of mercury required for the operation of the lamp being present in metallic form in a closed for the major part plate shaped metal container 5 which is arranged in the exhaust tube and is held in place by a waisted portion 7 in the container and a corre sponding rib 8 in the exhaust tube, in which method the container, after evacuation of the lamp, is heated so that it opens due to the mercury vapour pressure building up in it. According to the invention, a centrally arranged hole 14 is provided in the plate shaped part of the container between the waisted portion 7 and the end.
