## Description
METHOD FOR ENHANCING IONIZING RADIATION RESISTANCE OF POLYMER COMPOSITIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polymers which can be fabricated into transparent plastic articles, for example, aromatic polycarbonate resins and blends, are sometimes used in products for the medical field. These products include blood oxygenators, anesthesia canisters, intravenous connectors and accessories, pulsa ile balloon pumps, and blood centrifuge bowls. Such articles ere frequently sterilized1 typicallv by beating in an autoclave, or by contact with ethylene oxi e, or by exposure to ionizing radiation, e.g., gamma or electron beam radiation. Each of these techniaues has certain shortcomings, however.Autoclaves are often undesirable because of th thermal instability of many polymers, including polycarbonates and polyarylates, the relatively high energy requirements of the technique, and the residual wetness of the treated article which must first be dried before use. The utilization of ethylene oxide is objectionable because cf its toxicity, , its instability and the environmental concerns associated with its disposal. Sterilization by ionizing radiation is a useful alternative, being an essentially cry process that can be conducted at lo temperatures and which is rela tively inexpensive. The use of ionizing radiation when applied to articles made of polycarbonate resins, polyarylates, and blends in particular usually results, how ever, in the formation of a yellow coloration in the normaly optically clear polymer. This can be regarded as unsightly, and to counterast the effect coloring agents have often been incorporated into the polymer to mask the yellow color which forms with one considered more esthetically acceptable, for instance, z bluish tinge. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There has now been discovered z method for increasing the ionizing radiation resistance of polycar bonate homopolymers and copolymers and or polyarylates, alone, and in combination with second polymers that are normally prone to undergoing yellowing uDon repeated or prolonged exposure to such radiation. The method involves including an additive selected rom among non polymeric compounds that stabilize the polymer against ionizing radiation and which are characterized b Z strong oxidizing action and or reaction at high reaction rate with active sDecies such as radicals, OH radicals and or hydrated electrons formed by ionizing radiation.In one preferred feature, the second polymer is employed in an amount effective to render an independent color stabilizing effect. The stabilizer compounds of this invention can have one or more functional groups selected from among carboxy COOH , ester COOR , hydroxy OH , thio S , anilido C6H6NH , amino NH2 , oxamido H2NCOCONH , carbonyl CO , thio carbonyl CS , and phospho They may be selected from among esters, alcohols, hindered phenolic compounds, thioesters, oxamide phenolic compounds, oxalic anilide compounds, tniazol es, thiodiazoles, thiourea. phosphonates, phos phonites and diphosphonites. Only small amounts of the additive are needed to impart improved ionizing radiation resistance, and typically from about 0.05 to about 2.0 parts by weight per 100 parts of the polymer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TEE vION In general, the method of the invention is carried out by forming an intimate and substantially uniform admixture of the polycarbonate, or a wholly aromatic polyester polyarylate , to be treated and, optionally, a second polymer, and to combine therewith the described additive or additives. Formation of the mixture can be accomplished in any convenient manner, using standard blending eauipment and techniaues, for instance, by means of a mechanical blender, paddle mixer, tumbler device, or eauivalent. If desired, the polymer s and additive can be dissolved in a mutual solvent with thorough mixing, then recovered in the conventional manner, for instance, by distillation or evaporation of the solvent.Alternatively, the ingre dints can be melt blended, as by passage through an extruder at an elevated temperature or at temperatures slightly above the sor tenin point of the polymer or polymer blend. Any of these procedures is utilizable to add the stabilizing agent to the polymer or polymer blend. Polycarbonate homopolymers useful in this invention are especially aromatic polycarbonates. These polymers can be made by those skilled in the art or obtained rrom various commercial sources. The may be prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, a halorormate or a carbonate ester.Typically, they will have recurring structural units of the formulaEMI3.1 wherein A is a divalent aromatic radical of the dihydric phenol employed in the polymer producing reaction. Pre ferably, the aromatic carbonate polymers have an intrinsic viscosity ranging from 0.30 to 1.0 dl. g. measured in methylene chloride at 25 C. . By dihydric phenols is meant mononuclear or polynuclear aromatic compounds containing two hydroxy radicals, each of which is attached to a carbon atom of an aromatic nucleus.Typical dihydric phenols include 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,2 bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 4,4 di hydroxyphenyl ether, bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane, mixtures thereof and the like The preferred aromatic carbonate polymer is a homopolymer derived from 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl propane bisphenol A .

The molar proportions of dihydroxy diaryl units to benzenedicarboxylate units to carbonate units can range from 1 0.2 1.0 0.80 0.00 and the molar range of terephthalate units to isophthalate units can range from 99 1 to 1 9 in this preferred family of resins. Wnen the molar proportion of carbonate units is 0, the resin is a wholly aromatic polyester.See, Robeson, U.S. 4,324,869. Poly sulfone carbonates useful in the practice of this invention are thcse derived from the reaction of a sulfone, for example1 a dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, z dihydric phenol and phosgene or a phosgene precursor.

By way of illustration, such aiols include aliphatic, for example, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1, 3 propanediol, 1,2 butanediol, 1,4 butanediol, meso 2,3 butanediol, 1,2 pentanediol, 2,3 pentanediol, 1m4 pentanediol, 1,4 hexanedio, and the like, alicyclic, for example, 1,2 cyclopentanediol, 1,2 cyclohexanediol, and the like, branched acyclic, for example, 2,3 dimethyl 2,3 butanediol pinacol , and the like. The thioesters of thiodiesters used in the practice of the present process are those of tile formula EMI6.1 in which R and R are, independently, alkyl, straight or branched, of from 1 to 15 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, n butyl, n propyl, n pentyl, isobutyl, isopropyl, hexyl, etc. The thiodiazoles will be pentacyclic hydrocarbons containing 2 nitrogen atoms and 1 sulfur atom in the ring structure.

The phosphonates which are useful in this invention are those of the formulaEMI8.2 5 6 7 where R , R and R are, independently, alkyl or aryl of from 1 to 30 carbon atons, as well as nickel containing derivatives thereo Contemplated, too, are inorganic acid salts, and especially alkali netal salts of, for sulfurous acid, e.g., sodium sulfite. For those emlodiments of the invention containing a second resin1 the amount used with respect to the polycarbonate or polyarylate can vary widely.Generally, it will be in the range of 1 to 99 parts.by weight to correspondingly 99 to 1 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of first and second polymer, combined. polyesters suitable for use herein are derived from an aliphatic, aliphatic ether or cycloaliphatic diol, or mixtures thereof, preferably containing fre about 2 to about 10 carbon atoms, and one or more aromatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids. Preferred polyesters are derived from an aliphatic diol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid having repeating units of the following general formula EMI9.1 wherein n is an integer of from 2 to 4. The most preferred polyester is poly ethylene terephthalate .

The acids can be aliphatic or cycloaliphatic with the number of carbon atoms ranging from 2 to 20. Likewise, the glycols can be cycloaliphatic or aliphatic with the number of carbon atoms covering the same range. Polyalkylene ether glycols can also be used where the alkylene portion has from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and the entire glycol portion varies in molecular weight from 100 to 10,000. All such polyesters can be made following the teachings of, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,465,319 and 3,047,539. The polyesters which are derived from a cyclo aliphatic diol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid are prepared1 for example, by condensing either the cis or trans isomer or mixtures thereof of, for example, 1,4cyclohexanedimethanol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid so as to produce a polyester having recurring units of the following formula EMI10.1 wherein the cyclohexane ring is selected from the cisand trans isomers thereof and R represents an aryl or cycloaliphatic radical containing 6 to 20 carbon atoms and which is the decarboxylated residue derived from an aromatic dicarboxylic acid.
