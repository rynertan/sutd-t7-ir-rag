# LIQUID SOAP DISPENSER WITH IMPROVED PUMPING MECHANISM

## Abstract
A liquid soap dispensing system includes a closed soap reservoir having a manually actuated pumping mechanism located below and in fluid communication with the reservoir. The pumping mechanism basically comprises a cylindrical bowl having an open end defined by a continuous side wall and a moveable, substantially rigid closed end that is attached about its periphery to the bowl s side wall. The dispenser also includes a hand pulled lever having two moving ends that pivot around a pivot pin one end extending outside the dispenser for easy grasping thereof by the user with the other end being in sliding contact with the outer surface of the bowl s rigid end. In operation, a discrete quantity of liquid soap flows from the upper reservoir through a one way valve and fills the bowl s interior cavity. When the lever s grasping end is pulled, the lever s bulb contacting end pushes the bowl s rigid end up within the cross section defined by the bowl s side wall toward the bowl s open end and forces the soap contained therein out through a discharge conduit and into the user s hand. When the lever is released, the bowl expands and draws another discrete charge of soap from the upper reservoir.
