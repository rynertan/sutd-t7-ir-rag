# A packaging shrink film.

## Abstract
A packaging shrink film consisting essentially of a random copolymer of propylene and an α olefin having 4 or more carbon atoms or a random copolymer of propylene, an α olefin having 4 or more carbon atoms and ethylene, said random copolymer satisfying the following conditions 1 the content of an α olefin having 4 or more carbon atoms in the copolymer is 8 to 30 mole , 2 the content of ethylene in the copolymer is 3 mole or less, 3 the content of a cold xylene soluble portion in the copolymer is 15 to 60 by weight, and 4 the content of a boiling n heptane insoluble portion in the copolymer is 7 by weight or more, said film having been stretched. The packaging shrink film is soft and excels in low temperature shrink characteristics as well as in transparency and gloss.
