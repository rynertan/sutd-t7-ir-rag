# SNAP ACTION SWITCH FOR ALTERNATING CURRENT

## Abstract
A snap action switch, especially microswitch for alternat ing current comprises at least one stationary contact 2 on a stationary contact part 1 and at least one movable contact 4 on a movable contact part 3 . In order to open the switch in the proximity of the zero crossing of the switch current, on the one contact part 1 3 there is an electromagnet unit 8 excit ed by the switch current while on the other contact part 3 1 is disposed an armature unit 12 made of ferromagnetic mate rial which is located opposite the electromagnet unit 8 .
