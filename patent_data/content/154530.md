Food Sci. 36, 237 1971 , citric , malonic , lactic and galakturonic acids are present. Furthermore a sapDnine which after hydrolysis provides oleanolic acid and B sitosterine, is present VARSHNEY et al Chem. Abstr. 77, 85583 1972 . It will of course be appreciated that the precise chemical breakdown of the fruit may vary from one variety of fruit to the next and often also from one fruit to the next of the same variety Applicant does not know which of the aforesaid substances in fact constitute the active ingredients of the medicinal substance of the invention, but he believes that it may well comprise a combination of several of them.The extract according to the invention may be obtained in any suitable manner but preferably it includes the step of treating the fruit with a suitable solvent such as a suitable ketone and or alcohol, and or propylene glycol, and or glycerine, and or benzene, and or methylcinnamate.In a preferred form of the invention the solvent comprises acetone.Applicant has found the medicinal substance according to the invention effective in the treatment, and the prevention, of a variety of different diseases and illnesses, some of which belong to the group of so called incurable diseases such as cancer, for exampleApplicant has also found that because of it s ability to assist the body in getting rid of infected body cells, the substance is also suited for use as a tonic for improving the general health of humans.The substance has furthermore also been found suitable for the treatment of cell damage caused to the body of humans and or animals by harmful rays such as X rays, gamma rays etc.The medicinal substance according to the invention may be administered orally, intravenously or topically depending on the particular type of disease or illness being treated. It will be appreciated that the particular mode of administration will determine the form and concentration in which the medicinal substance has to be utilised.In one embodiment of a method for preparing a medicinal substance according to the invention, which will now be described by way of example only, a quantity of fruit of Psidium guajava Linn of the type commonly known as the Medeira guava is peeled, the pips removed, and the residue heated to boiling with approximately 2kg of sugar to every 100kg of fruit. The product is allowed to simmer for approximately one hour and then allowed to cool.A quantity of acetone equal in volume to that of the aforesaid product is added thereto and the mixture allowed to stand over for a period of time, preferably for at least twelve hours.The fibres and other solid material are removed from the products in any suitable manner, such as by means of filtration, and the resulting liquid component is then heated under vacuum until its volume has been reduced to approximately one sixth of its original volume. The resulting liquid, which is sdbstantially completely acetone free, has a clear amber colour.Instead of the aforesaid final heating step, the liquid component may be ignited to cause the burning off of approximately 90 of the acetone. In this case the resulting liquid, which is suited for external application only, has a dark brown colour. If required, the liquid may be heated further to remove the remaining acetone.Applicant has found that as far as the treatment of malignant cancers are concerned, the best results acetone free are obtained if the aforesaid resulting liquid, which comprises the medicinal substance according to the invention, is administered orally in an average dose of 30 ml three times per day.In the case of lung cancer, applicant has found that on an average a total amount of approximately 1500 ml of such liquid, administered in the aforesaid manner, is required to cure a patient.In the case of human cell damage caused by excessive exposure to X rays and or gamma rays, applicant has found that on an average between 1000 ml and 3000 ml acetone free of the aforesaid resulting liquid given at a dosage of 30 ml three times per day is required to cure a patient.Applicant has found the aforesaid resulting liquid to remain stable and fungus free over very long periods of time, even if kept at very high or very low temperatures.For an oral application, the aforesaid resulting acetone free liquid comprising the medicinal substance according to the invention ray be utilised as such, or it may be mixed with a zsitble flavouring agent such as lemon syrup, for example, which results in a drink with a wine like taste. Applicant has also found that a drink with a particularly pleasing taste results if the medicinal substance according to the invention is mixed with wine. In the case of the treatment of non malignant skin cancer, the aforesaid resulting acetone free liquid preferably mixed with 10 acetone by volume or the afore saia resulting liquid which resulted fran the burmng off of 90 percent of the acetone, may be applied as such to the area being treated.Such treatment may, for example, be carried out by locating a dressing of an absorbent material over the area being treated and then covering it with a second dressing of a non absorbent material.Further applications of medicinal substance may then be effected by putting a few dropsof the substance into the absorbent dressing, say, by means of a syringe or the like, to keep the absorbent material saturated.Although applicant has found that skin cancers may be cured by means of such treatment in a few days, he believes it advisable that the treatment be continued for at least equal the period of time which was required for the treated area to appear visably cured.In the case of other forms of cancer it is also believed advisable for the treatment to be continued for equal the period of time required for curing the illness.Apart from numerous actual successful treatments of humans, and animals such as dogs, suffering from various types of cancers with the medicinal substance according to the invention, the applicant has also performed the following test in the laboratory Forty mice were injected with a carcinogenic material and within six weeks twenty eight had developed large tumors. All the mice lost their hair on their shoulders, face, and ears, and some on other parts of their body. They were listless, their eyes re dulL nd visually they were very sick.Fourteen of the mice with tumors and six of the others were separated and exposed to a sole supply of drinking water which contained, on a volume per volume basis, 25 of the aforesaid acetone free resulting liquid comprising the substance according to the invention.After ten weeks these mice had grown hair and by appearance they were cured. By this time all the untreated mice had died.In an attempt to test the medicinal substance according to the invention for any possible harmful effects on humans and or animals, applicant himself over a period of 100 days consumed approximately 15 acetone free liters of the aforesaid resulting liquid without noticing any side effects. In the case of mice, which were given orally 390 mls of the same substance over a period of 120 days, a dosage which, considering the weight ratio between humans and mice, is approximately thirty times the volume which the applicant found is required on an average to cure lung cancer in a human, the only side effect was a temporary occurence of premature births which only lasted for a couple of months. The premature born mice showed no signs of deformity. It will be appreciated that the invention provides a medicinal substance which can provide a major breakthrough in the treatment of a variety of diseases especially hitherto believed incurable diseases and illnesses.It will be appreciated further that there are many variations in detail possible with a medicinal substance, and its method of preparation, according to the invention without departing form the scope of the appended claims.
