# Passive seat belt system for an automotive vehicle with tilting seats.

## Abstract
The system includes a mechanical linkage 11 between the seat back 19 and a guide member 13 which holds the belt 1 in an appropriate operating position. The linkage 11 serves to move the guide member 13 forward as the seat back 19 is tilted forward, to move the guide member 13 to its normal working position when the seat back 19 is moved to its normal upright position, and to hold the guide member 13 in its working position as the seat back 19 is tilted backwards. The mechanical linkage 11 includes a linkage lever 25 , of which one end is pivotably attached to the seat back 19 and the other end constitutes a contoured lost motion linkage engaging the pivotable guide member 13 . The lost motion linkage is designed to actuate move ment of the guide member 13 when the seat back 19 moves within the forward moiety of its reclining range, and to be only slackly engaged with the guide member 13 when the seat back 19 is moved in the portion of its reclining range rearward of its normal upright position. A stop holds the guide member 13 in its working position in the latter case.
