## Description
METHOD FOR THE PREPALTION OF A FUNGAL BODY AND LIPID THEREFROM AND THE USE OF U LIPID The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of a fungal body containing a large amount of lipid and a method for obtaining a lipid from such a body. More particularly, the invention relates to a method for the preparation of a fungal body of certain fungus stocks, e.g. isabellina, vinacea, ramanniana var. anglispora, nana and the like belonging to the genus of Mortierella, rich in the content of lipid and a method for obtaining lipid therefrom. It has been hitherto reported that several fungal bodies contain a considerably large amount of lipid including neutral lipids, i.e. oils and fats, and polar lipids, i.e. phospholipids and glycolipids in a content of, for example, 25 to 65 by weight on the dry basis.Such high lipid filamentous fungus moulds are exemplified by Geotricum candidum, Fusarium lini, Fusarium buligenum, Penicillium lilacinum, Penicillium soppi,Penicillium spinulosum, Aspergillus nidulance and Mucor sacineleudes reported by K. Yamada, Mortierella vinacea reported by C.G.C. Chester et al. and Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus ochraceus, Cladosporium fulvum,Cladosporium herbarum and Penicillium gladioli reported by J. Singh et al. These fungi can be cultured in a culture medium containing a carbohydrate as the carbon source and the preferable concentration of the carbohydrate as the nutrient in the culture medium is reportedly 20 to 60 g litre when they are cultured in a flask or in a smallsize culture tank. When a fungal body of high lipid content is desired of these fungi, the velocity and extent of the multiplication of the filamentous fungus body are usually not so high that the carbohydrate as the carbon source is not exhaustively consumed up.For example, it is reported by Chester et al. that the best results obtained in the culture of Mortierella vinacea were that the use of a culture medium containing glucose in an initial concentration of 21.2 litre at 20 OC gave 4.7 g litre of the fungal body as dried containing 3 g litre of the lipid extractable therefrom after consumption of 17 g of starting glucose for 10 days. When molasses is used as the carbon source in the culture ofPenicillium spinurosum, it is noted that the increase in the concentration of the carbon source in the culture medium does not contribute to the increase of the multiplication of the fungal body so much with rather decreased proportion of the consumed carbon source on the contrary.In this case, the highest results reported byKhen et al. are that the amount of the multiplication of the fungal body as dried was 22 g litre containing only 2.5 g litre of the lipid extractable therefrom after 6 days of culture at 30 OC starting with a molasses concentration of 164 g litre of which about 40 is consumed by the multiplication of the fungus. The present invention has been completed on the basis of the discovery that, when cultured under specific culture condition, filamentous fungus stocks ofMortierella isabellina, M. vinacea, M. ramanniana var.anglispora and N. nana can give fungal bodies of very high lipid content of 35 to 70 by weight with high productivity. The possibility of such a high density culture of Mortierella fungi has been quite unexpected because it is generally accepted that filamentous fungi multiplying with hyphae can hardly be cultured in a high density condition of the fungal oty, different fran bacteria and yeast.The present discov however, shows that these specific fungi o multiply in small discrete units without extending the hyphae in a culture medium containing a carbohydrate as the carbon source under an agitating condition by aeration when the velocity of aeration is increased to give a possibility of obtaining a fungal body of high lipid content in very high density per unit volume of the medium. For example, glucose as the starting carbohydrate contained in the culture medium in a concentration as high as 270 g litre is exhaustively consumed by the culture of the fungus at 30 OC for 72 hours to give 100 g litre medium or more of the fungal body as dried containing about 50 g litre of the lipid corresponding to a lipid content of about 50 . Thus, the method of the present invention for the preparation of a fungal body containing a large amount of the lipid comprises culturing a fungus stock ofMortierella isabellina, N. vinacea, M. ramanniana var.anglispora or M. nana under aeration in a culture medium containing a carbohydrate as the carbon source in a concentration in the range from 60 to 400 g litre. Further, the method of the present invention for the preparation of a lipid from a fungal body comprises culturing a fungus stock of M. isabellina,M. vinacea, M. ramanniana var. anglispora or M. nana under aeration in a culture medium containing a carbohydrate as the carbon source in a concentration from 60 to 400 g litre to grow a fungal body containing a lipid, optionally separating the body from the culture medium, and extracting the lipid contained in the body, e.g. with an organic solvent. As is understood from the above description, the inventive method is performed by use of the filamentous fungal stocks belonging to the genus of Mortierella including M. isabellina IFO 7824, 7873, 7884, 8183 and 8308, M. vinacea IFO 6738, M. ramanniana var. anglisporaIFO 8187 and N. nana IFO 8794. Each of these stocks is kept and available at the Institute forFermentation, Osaka and also registered in the IFOCatalogue bearing the IFO number as given above. In culturing the fungal stock, the culture medium should contain a carbohydrate as the carbon source which may be, for example, glucose, fructose, saccharose, molasses, starch, saccharification liquid of wood and others. The concentration of the carbohydrate in the culture medium should be high enough in the range from 60 to 400 g per litre of the culture medium. The nitrogen source to be added to the culture medium may be any one of inorganic nitrogen sources such as ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, ammonium chloride and ammonium phosphate or organic nitrogen sources such as urea, peptone, yeast extract and corn steep liquor.The culture medium should contain small amounts of inorganic metal salts such as potassium dihydrogenphosphate KH2PO4, dipotassium hydrogenphosphate K2HP04, sodium chloride NaCl, iron II sulphate FeSO 7H2O, magnesium sulphateMgSO4.7H2O, zinc sulphate ZnSO4. 7H2O and the like. It is of course optional that certain micronutrients and other nutritive substances may be added to the culture medium according to need. The culturing of the above mentioned filamentous fungus is performed usually in a liquid medium with agitation by aeration. The value of pH of the culture medium should preferably be in the range from 4.0 to 6.0 and culturing is continued for 2 to 15 days at a temperature in the range from 15 to 40 OC under agitation at a relatively high velocity of 300 to 800 r.p.m. with aeration at a rate of 0.5 to 2 v.v.m. In this manner, a fung al body of very high lipid content is produced in the culture medium in a high density so that the body is separated from the culture medium and the lipid contained therein is extracted by a suitable means such as extraction by use of an organic solvent. It is noted that, in accordance with the culturing method of the present invention, the multiplication of the filamentous fungus takes place with relatively suppressed extension of the hyphae in extremely minute discrete units each containing only 1 to 10 cells so that the separation of the fungal body from the culture medium is greatly facilitated by use of, for example, a dehydrator or the like machine to give a body with an advantageously low water content of as low as about 60 . The recovery of the lipid from the thus dehydrated fungfal body is undertaken according to a conventional procedure such as extraction with an organic solvent. The inventive method performed in the above described manner can afford the possibility of the production of a lipid with very high productivity because the culturing of the filamentous fungus can be performed in very high density to give a body of very high lipid content by use of a culture medium containing a carbohydrate as the carbon source in a high concentration hitherto not used in the culture of filamentous fungi along with ease and high efficiency in the recovery of the lipid from the thus grown fungal body. The advantage in the productivity is particularly apparent from the calculation of the capacity of the apparatus required for unit production of the lipid.For example, the hourly production of the fungal body per unit volume of the culture medium would be 1.7 g body per litre per hour assuming a fungal body multiplication of 100 g litre medium and in consideration of the culture time necessary to obtain this multiplication estimated from the results of the experimentation described below. Therefore, a constant yearly running of 1000 m3 of the culture medium, which isin practice possible by a combined cycling use of 3 culture tanks each having a capacity of 800 m3, would provide a yearly fungal body production of 14,000 tons year corresponding to a yearly lipid production of 7,000 tons year assuming a 50 content of the lipid in the body. In addition, the lipid produced in this manner contains more than 95 of fats or oils, i.e.triglycerides, so that it is useful not only as a food but also as a starting material for the manufacture of various products derived from fats and oils. The phospholipids and glycolipids contained in the lipid are useful as an ingredient of medicines or as a surface active agent. Furthermore, the fungal body residue after extraction of the lipid is composed mainly of proteins and nucleic acids respectively useful in the applications as a provender and medicines. The following tramples illustrate the inventive method in more detail but do not limit the scope of the invention in any way.Example 1. Culture media were prepared each by dissolving in 1000 ml of deionized water a varied amount of a carbon source which was either glucose or molasses, 2 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate KH2PO4, 0.3 g of magnesium sulphate MgSO4 7H2O, 0.1 g of sodium chloride NaCI, 0.2 g of malt extract, 0.2 g of yeast extract, 0.1 g of peptone, 10 mg of iron 11 sulphate FeSO4 7H2O, 10 mg of calcium chloride CaC12 2H2O, 0.2 mg of copper 11 sulphate CuSO4 5H2O, 1.0 mg of manganese sulphate MnSO4 4H2O and a varied amount of a nitrogen source which was either ammonium sulphate or urea. The formulation of the carbon source and the nitrogen source is shown inTable 1 below.When 60 g of glucose and 3 g of ammonium sulphate were added to the medium as the carbon source and the nitrogen source, respectively, the C N ratio, i.e. the weight ratio of the carbon atoms to nitrogen atoms, in the culture medium was about 40 although theC N ratio was varied in some tests to examine the effects of the nitrogen concentration or C N ratio. Into a culture tank of 10 litres or 30 litres capacity were introduced 6 litres or 20 litres, respectively, of the above prepared culture medium to which either one of the above named fungal stocks was inoculated and cultured therein at 30 OC under agitation at a velocity of 300 to 700 r.p.m. with aeration at a rate of 0.5 to 2.0 v.v.m. In the course of culturing in this manner, a 100 ml portion of the culture medium was periodically taken out of the tank and filtered to separate the fungal body from the culture medium. A part of the thus collected body was subjected to determination of the water content by drying in a thermostat at i2o OC for 24 hours after exact weighing and the remainder was used for the extraction of the lipid.Thus, s wet fungal body obtained by filtration was added to a 2 1 by volume mixture of chloroform and methyl alcohol and homogenized in the presence of glass beads to effect simultaneous grinding of the body and extraction of the lipid from the ground body into the solvent. This extraction procedure was repeated 5 times each with a fresh portion of the solvent and all the extract solutions were combined together.After purification by the method of partition washing according to Folch, the solvents were removed from the combined extract solution by evaporation under reduced pressure and the amount of the total lipid was determined by weighing the residual matter. The culture medium after separation of the fungal body by filtration was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography HPLC to determine the concentration of the unconsumed carbohydrate, i.e. glucose per se or glucose, fructose and saccharose in the molasses.When the results of this high performance liquid chromatography indicated complete consumption of the carbohydrate in the culture medium, the culturing was terminated and the time from the start was recorded as shown in Table 1. Table 1 gives the results obtained with M.isabellina IFO 7884 and includes the data of the fungal body multiplication as the dried amount in a litre of the medium, the amount of the lipid recovered therefrom in g litre, the content of lipid in the dry fungal body in , the lipid coefficient, i.e. the amount of the produced lipid in g per 100 g of the consumed carbohydrate, and the fungous body coefficient, i.e. the amount of dry fungi. body in g per 100 g of the consumed carbohydrate. The data are the results obtained for the final culture medium after complete consumption of the carbohydrate, which was subjected to centrifugal separation of the fungal body. As is shown in Table 1, the multiplication of the fungal body was rapid even when the concentration of the carbohydrate, i.e. glucose or molasses, was as high as 250 g litre or more to give a fungal body concentration of about 100 g litre and a lipid production of about 50 g litre or more corresponding to a lipid content of 45 or higher in the dry fungal body. When the starting glucose concentration was increased to 390 g litre, a final fungaL body concentration of 156 g litre was reached corresponding to a lipid production of 83 g litre. In this case, however, the velocity of funga l body multiplication was remarkably reduced due to substrate inhibition, especially, at the starting stage of the culturing in comparison with the case where the concentration of the carbohydrate was 300 g litre or smaller,taking almost twice the culture time for completion of multiplication. Therefore, such a condition of an extremely high carbohydrate concentration is not always practical in view of the excessively long culture time for the multiplication of the fungal body but the final fungal body concentration per se is still so high as not to be achieved in the prior art methods.

Various kinds of filamentous fungi belonging to the genus of Mortierella were cultured in a culture tank of 10 litre capacity under the same culturing conditions as in Example 1 except that the concentrations of glucose as the carbon source and urea as the nitrogen source were 200 g litre and 6.5 g litre, respectively, in each of the culture tests. This carbohydrate concentration of 200 g litre was undertaken in consideration of the fact that the culture test by use of the 10 litre culture tank was under a limitation of the apparatus in respect of the concentration of the dissolved oxygen acting as a rate determining factor on the velocity of the fungus multiplication so that the concentration of the carbon source could not be so high as in the use of the 30 litre culture tank.Nevertheless, the glucose in the culture medium was exhaustively consumed in each of the culture tests as is shown in Table 2 below to give a fungal body multiplication of at least 70 g litre and at least 30 g litre of the lipid production regardless of the species of fungi.
