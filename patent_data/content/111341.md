# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A VINYL POLYMER

## Abstract
In a process for producing an intended polymer by polymerizing at least one vinyl compound, an improvement which comprises calculating the concentration of the un reacted vinyl compound in the reactor, the composition of the polymer formed, and the amount thereof from the amount of heat calculated from the heat balance of the reactor, the amounts of raw materials fed to the reactor, the reactivity ratio of the vinyl compounds and the heat of polymerization per unit amount of each of the vinyl com pounds, and regulating the amounts of raw materials to be fed into the reactor in such a way that the values thus calculated agree respectively with the predetermined target values of the polymer composition and the amount of polymer formed.
