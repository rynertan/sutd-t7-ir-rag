To the solution was added 4 nitrobenzyl 7 2 phenylacetamido 3acetoxymethylenecepham 4 carboxylate 5.4 g. at 10 C, and stirred at the same temperature for 1.5 hours.Methanol 8 ml. was added to the solution at 300C and stirred at 0 C for 40 minutes.Water 10 ml. and methylene chloride 50 ml. were added to the solution and adjusted to pH 5.0 with an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. The organic layer was separated, washed with water 30 ml x 2 and adjusted to pH 7.5 with an aqueous solution of sodium,bicarbonate. The organic layer was separated, washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and dried over magnesia sulfate. After treating the solution with activated charcoal, the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was pulver zed with diisopropyl ether and the precipitates were collected by filtration to give 4 nitrobenzyl 7 amino 3 acetoxymethylenecepha 4 carboxylate 3.0 g. . I.R.
