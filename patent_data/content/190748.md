# Gas reaction apparatus and multi wall pipe type burner therefor.

## Abstract
A gas reaction apparatus K1 for manufacturing base material 15 of optical fiber and a multi wall pipe type burner 10 for the gas reaction apparatus K1 . The gas reaction apparatus K1 includes a mechanism 16, 17 which heats or heat insulates at least one of gas passages of the burner 10 for gaseous raw material of optical fiber so as to set a saturated vapor pressure of whole kinds of the gaseous raw material higher than a partial pressure of raw material of optical fiber in the gaseous raw material when the gaseous raw material is fed through the one of the gas passages.
