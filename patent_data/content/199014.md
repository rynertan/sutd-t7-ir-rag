# Apparatus and method for determining focus correction for a lithographic tool.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for determining alignment correction for a lithographic tool are provided. A periodic surface relief structure containing alignment information is illuminated so that diffraction beams are generated. The object is translated orthogonally to the periodic structure to cause a change in the intensity of the diffracted beams. Alignment correction is determined based upon the changes in the intensity of the diffracted beams.
