# Photoflash array with selective pairing of lamps.

## Abstract
A photoflash lamp array having a plurality of 2n flash lamps 21 30 , a common terminal 10 connected to one lead in wire 21b 30b of each of the lamps, and a plurality of n selective terminal means 11 15 , each associated with a respective pair of the lamps and directly connected to the non common lead in wire 21a 30a of one lamp of each pair. A respective normally open switch 31 35 is coupled between the non common lead in wires of each of the pairs of lamps associated with a selective terminal. Each of the switches is responsive to the flashing of the directly connected lamp of an associated pair so as to electrically connect the other lamp of the pair to the asso ciated selective terminal. In one specific example, ten lamps are selectively paired to be operated sequentially by firing pulses successively applied to five selective terminals to gether with a common terminal.
