# Synthetic polymer emulsifier, process for preparing the same and its use in manufacturing a synthetic latex.

## Abstract
A condensation product of naphthalenesulfonic acid and linear alkylbenzenesulfonic acid having an alkyl moiety of from about 4 to about 20 carbon atoms with formaldehyde or salt thereof is useful as a secondary emulsifier and co emulsifier in synthetic polymer latex processes. From about 0.05 to about 5 parts by weight of the condensation product per 100 parts by weight of latex monomer is used as a secondary emulsifier and from about 0.5 to about 5 parts by weight of the condensation product per 100 parts by weight of latex monomer is used as a co emulsifier. Additionally, products can be prepared which have been found to be biodegradable. Use of these condensation products eliminates pollution caused by a secondary emulsifier or co emulsifier in polymer manufacture effluent.
