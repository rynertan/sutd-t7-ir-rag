# Trailer braking system.

## Abstract
A trailer braking system for a tractor trailer configuration is of the type which includes a primary air reservoir 12 on the tractor 10 which supplies an auxiliary air reservoir 22 on the trailer 18 . A pedal brake actuator 26 on the tractor selec tively provides control air from the primary air reservoir 12 on the tractor to a relay valve 42 on the trailer which control air causes air from the auxiliary air reservoir 22 to be directed to the brakes 46 on the trailer. There is provided a secondary source of control air on the trailer in the form of a control air reservoir 54 having a volume significantly smaller than the volume of the auxiliary air reservoir 22 . The control air reser voir 54 is supplied control air through a first line 59 from the auxiliary air reservoir 12 . A second line 60 from the control air reservoir 54 goes to the relay valve 42 and includes a check valve 62 therein to only allow the control air to be capable of passing from the control air reservoir 54 to the relay valve 42 . A normally open first valve element 64 is in the first line 59 and a normally closed second valve element 66 is in the second line 60 . An electrical solenoid 96 for the first valve element and the second valve element 66 which is actuated by an electrical signal which is produced when con trol air is provided by the pedal brake actuator 26 closes the first valve element 64 and opens the second valve element 66 to provide control air from the control air reservoir 54 to the control valve 42 prior to control air from the primary air reservoir 12 through the pedal brake actuator 26 .
