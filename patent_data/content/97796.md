# Process and apparatus for unsoldering solder bonded semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
An apparatus for removing solder bonded devices from a substrate which includes a hollow housing 18 having an open end with a seating portion 26 adapted to engage the flat backside of a semiconductor device 12 , an inlet 28 for admitting heated gases to the interior of the housing, and an outlet 30 for the heated gases, a baffle 32 within the housing having an end portion recessed from the seating portion 26 , which baffle directs heated gas downwardly agains the backside of the device, and clamping means 40 to secure the device 12 on the seating portion. The rework method for removing a solder bonded semiconductor device 12 from a substrate 14 leaving only a coating of solder on the pad site sufficient to solder bond another device without the need for additional pad site preparation includes the steps of preheating the substrate and solder bonded devices to a temperature not greater than 100 C less than the melting point of the solder of the solder bonds, selectively directing a constrained stream of heated inert gas to the backside of the device to quickly raise the temperature of the solder bonds above the melting point of the solder, and lifting the device from the substrate before the heat applied by the heated gas significantly heats the top of the substrate 14 above the preheated temperature.
