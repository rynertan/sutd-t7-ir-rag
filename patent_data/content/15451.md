# Boride coated cemented carbide.

## Abstract
A coated cemented carbide article comprises a cement ed carbide substrate, the surface regions thereof having dif used therein an element such as boron, silicon or aluminium. The article further comprises a coating disposed on the dif used substrate, the coating being a boride such as titanium boride, hafnium boride, zirconium boride or tantalum boride. In another embodiment the coated cemented article further in cludes an interlayer sandwiched between the diffused sub strate and the boride coating, the interlayer being one or more layers formed from the carbides, nitrides or carbonitrides of elements from groups IVb and Vb of the Periodic Table of Ele nents, and combinations thereof.
