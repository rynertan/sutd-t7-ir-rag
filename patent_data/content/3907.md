# Chemical process on the surface of a rotating body, the subsequent discharging of the reaction product and the reactor used.

## Abstract
A wide variety of chemical processes using thin films of reactants are carried out on an internal cylindrical surface of a vessel 1 rotating at high speed and the products discharged from the surface after the reaction has occurred preferably by using the centrifugal force of the rotation.
