## Description
BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL LOWERING AGENTS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of lowering the blood glucose level and a blood glucose level lowering agent Chypoglycemic agent . BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Recently, metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity and arteriosclerosis, resulting from an increase in a blood glucose level due to excessive intake of digestible saccharides, particularly starch and sucrose, have been increasing. Such unbalanced eating habits of intaking digestible saccharides are also responsible for digtive diseases, such as diarrhea, gastroenteric catarrh and abnormal zymosis in the bowel. Completely satisfactory drugs for these diseases have not yet been discovered, and it has long been desired to develop improved drugs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that an enzyme capabl e of synthesizing sparingly digestible saccharides, such as polysaccharides and oligosaccharides e.g., cyclodextrin , from easly digestible saccharides, such as monosaccharides, oligosaccharides Ce.g., dextrin, maltose, isomaltose and sucrose and polysaccharides,. lowers blood glucose levels in mammals including human beings, and has excellent effects in preventing and treating metabolic and digestive diseases. As a result of an extensive search for a substance having a blood glucose level lowering activity, it has further been discovered that when an enzyme capable of synthesizing sparingly digestible saccharides. from easily digestible saccharides is used in combination with a glucosidase inhibiting agent which has already been known to have the effect of lowering a blood glucose level, the blood glucose level lowering effect is enhanced synergistically compared to when they are used separately. Thus, the present invention provides, in one embodiment, a method of lowering the blood glucose level in mammals comprising orally administering an enzyme capable of synthesizing sparingly digestible saccharides from easily digestible saccharides, and in another embodiment, a blood glucose level lowering agent containing an enzyme capable of synthesizing sparingly digestible saccharides from easily digestible saccharides and a glucosidase inhibiting agent. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Enzymes which can be used in the invention, i.e., having the ability to synthesize sparingly digestible saccharides from easily digestible saccharides include Dextransucrase, produced by the generaLeuconostoc, Streptococcus, and Betabacterium, which synthesizes dextran from sucrose Dextran 6 glycociltransferase, produced by the genus Acetobacter, which synthesizes dextran from amylodextrin Levansucrase, produced by the genera Bacillus, Acetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Xanthomonas, which synthesizes levan from sucrose Amylomaltase, produced by the genus Escherichia, which synthesizes amylose from maltose Amylosucrase, produced by the genus Neisseria, which synthesizes amylopectinlike polysaccharide from sucrose and cyclodextrinsynthesizing enzymes, produced by the genera Bacillus and Klebsiella, which synthesize cyclodextrin C, ss and y types from starch or sucrose.

Chem.,Vol. 42, pp. 323 326 1978 . In addition, various polysaccharide synthesizing enzymes or enzyme systems produced by bacteria, yeast and fungi, which synthesize sparingly digestible polysaccharides e.g., cellulose, pullulan, nigeran, Bglucans and curdrun , can be used in the invention.Furthermore, enzymes synthesizing polysaccharides of plants, such as hemi cellulose, pectin, and rubber like polysaccharides enzymes synthesizing various seaweed polysaccharides and animal enzymes synthesizing mucopolysaccharides see A.

Furthermore, either dead cells or living cells containing these enzymes can be used. The toxicity of these enzymes is very low LD50 1 g kg mice, P.O. . The glucosidase inhibiting agent which is used in the other embodiment of the invention inhibits the amylase, sucrase and maltase actions. Examples of such glucosidase inhibiting agents include Bay g 5421, TAI,S AI, S GI, Haim, Nozilimycin, and Tris.

These glucosidase inhibiting agents may be used in either purified or crude form. The toxicity of these inhibiting agents is very low CLD50 500 mg kg, mice,P.O. . Where the enzyme capable of synthesizing sparingly digestible saccharides from easily digestible saccharides is used in combination with the glucosidaseinhibiting agent, the composition ratio can be varied within a wide range. It is most preferred, however, that the weight ratio of the enzyme to the glucosidaseinhibiting agent is from 1 20 to 20 1. The blood glucose level lowering agent used according to the invention is either the enzyme alone, or a combination of the enzyme and the glueosidassew biti4g. agent, which can be prepared simply by mixing them. The blood glucose level lowering agent can be converted into a powder, a capsule, a tablet or the like, along with suitable excipients. Furthermore, it may contain a stabilizer. Moreover, it can be used in combination with other agents to prevent and treat metabolic and digestive diseases. The blood glucose level lowering agent of the invention can be administered orally, lntraperitoneally, or intravenously. In general, oral administration is suitable. Although the amount of the blood glucose level lowering agent the enzyme alone or a mixture of the enzyme and the glucosidase inhibiting agent being administered varies depending on the type of disease, extent, and so forth, it is usually from about 0.2 to 2,000 mg day, and in particular, it is preferred that the blood glucose level lowering agent is administered orally in an amount of 1 to 100 mg day. Hereinafter, the invention is described in greater detail by reference to the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 i A dextransucrase producing strain, Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B 1299, was aerobically cultivated at 260C for 24 hours by the use of a culture medium containing 25 of sucrose, 2 of corn steep liquor, 0.2 ofK2HPO4, 0.018 of MgSO487H2O, 0.00l of FeSO4.7H2O, 0.0018 of MnCt4H2O, and 0.0018 of NaCt, and having a pH of 7.4. After the cultivation was completed, the medium was filtered to separate it into a filtrate and a solid fraction. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to a part of the filtrate with stirring at room temperature to 30 saturation, followed by further stirring for 30 minutes.Precipitates formed were collected by centrifugation and discarded. Thereafter, to the resulting liquid was added ammonium sulfate to 708 saturation, and precipi tates thus formed were collected by centrifugation. The precipitates were dissolved in a 0.01 M phosphate buffer at pH 6.7, dialyzed overnight against the buffer and freeze dried to obtain Enzyme A. A part of the remaining filtrate was directly freeze dried to obtain a crude enzyme Enzyme B . A part of the solid fraction was treated with acetone at low temperatures to obtain an acetone dried cell fraction Enzyme C . The remaining solid fraction was ground along with silica sand at a low temperature and was subjected to high speed centrifugal separation.The supernatant liquid was withdrawn and freeze dried to obtain Enzyme D. ii Male ICR mice t18 to 21 g were divided into groups o f five mice, deprived of food for 24 hours and orally administered with 2.5 g kg of sucrose. At the same time, each of the above prepared enzymes was orally administered in an amount of 100 mg kg. After 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and 3 hours, blood samples werecollected, and the blood glucose level was determined.The results are shown in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that with the groups to which Enzymes A, B, C and D were administered, the blood glucose level was markedly reduced compared with the control group to which sucrose alone was administered. The values in Table 1 are average values for each group of five mice. TABLE 1 Blood Glucose Level mg dt After After After After 15 30 Group Min. Min.

The pH of the filtrate was adjusted to 5.5, and an equal amount of acetone was added thereto while stirring and cooling. Precipitates formed were collected by centrifugal separation, fully washed with acetone, and dried to obtain a dry powder Enzyme E . ii The influences of Enzyme E on the blood glucose level was examined by the same method as inExample 1. The results are shown in Table 2. It can be seen from Table 2 that the group administered with Enzyme E showed a marked reduction in the blood glucose level compared with the control group.

After the cultivation, an extract containing no cell was obtained and treated with ammonium sulfate to obtain a fraction. The thus obtained fraction was freeze dried to obtain Enzyme F. ii The blood glucose level lowering effect ofEnzyme F was examined by the same method as in Example 1.The results are shown in Table 3. As can be seen fromTable 3, a significant effect was observed. TABLE 3 Blood Glucose Level mg d After After After After 15 30 Group Min. Min. l Hr. 3 Hr.

Preclpitates formed were collected, dissolved in a small amount of water, and freeze dried to obtain Enzyme G. ii The blood glucose level lowering effect ofEnzyme G was examined by the same method as in Example 1 with the exception that 1 g kg of starch was used in place of the sucrose. The results are shown in Table 4.As can be seen from Table 4, a significant effect was observed. TABLE 4 Blood Glucose Level mg dt After After 15 30 After After Group Min.

The culturedbroth was filtered to obtain a filtrate. To the thus obtained filtrate was added cold acetone to form precipitates.The precipitates were collected and freeze dried to obtain a crude enzyme CEnzyme H . The blood glucoselevel lowering effect of Enzyme H.was examined by the same method as in Example 4. The results are shown inTable 5. As can be seen from Table 5, a significant effect was observed.

On the other hand, a test group Cfive mice was administered with Enzyme B prepared in Example 1 in an amount of 100 mg kg day while breeding with the same test food as used above. After 2 weeks, blood samples were collected, and the amount of neutral fat in serum was determined by the usual method as described in I. Kanai and M. Kanai,Rinsho Kensaho Teian, Kinbara Shuppan, Edit. 27, VII 66 1975 . With the control group, the amount was 218 mgldt, whereas with the test group, 136 mg dt, and it can thus be seen that the value is markedly reduced by the administration of Enzyme B. The values are average values for each group of five mice. EXAMPLE 7 Ci A dextransucrase producing strain, Streptococcus . mutans 20623 FERM BP No. 57 , was inoculated on a brain heart infusion broth Eiken Cproduced by Eiken KagakuCo., Ltd. and aerobically cultivated thereon at 370C for 18 hours. After the cultivation was completed, the cultured broth was filtered to obtain a filtrate. The thus obtained filtrate was adjusted to 60t saturation by adding ammonium sulfate. Precipitates formed were collected by centrifugation. The precipitates were then dissolved in a 0.01 M phosphate buffer at pH 6.7, dialyzed overnight against the buffer and freeze dried to obtain Enzyme I. Cii Male wistar rats C142 to 151 g Cgroups of six rats were deprived of food for 24 hours. Enzyme I was orally administered in an amount of 10 mg kg, and, at the same time, sucrose was orally administered in an amount of 2 g kg. 30 minutes after the administration, blood samples were collected and the blood glucose level was measured. With the control group to which sucrose alone was administered, the blood glucose level was 171 mg dLt whereas the blood glucose level of the test group to which Enzyme I was administered was markedly reduced to 127 Fg dt Can average blood glucose value for each group of stx rats . EXAMPLE 8 Ci A dextransucrase producing strain, Streptococcus salivarius IFO 13956, was inoculated on a brain heayt infusion broth Eiken and aerobically cultivated thereon at 370C for 18 hours. After the cultivation was completed, the cultured broth was filtered to obtain a filtrate. The thus obtained filtrate was adjusted to 60 saturation by adding ammonium sulfate. Precipitates thus formed were collected, dialyzed with a 0.01 M phosphate buffer, and freeze dried to obtain Enzyme J. The blood glucose level lowering effect ofEnzyme J was determined by the same method as in Example 7 with the exception that the amount of Enzyme J administered was changed to 30 mg kg. With the control group to which sucrose alone was added, the blood glucose level after 30 minutes was 172 mg dt, whereas the blood glucose level of the group to which Enzyme J was administered was significantly reduced to 138 mg dt an average blood glucose value for each group of six rats . EXAMPLE 9 i A cyclodextrin synthesizing enzyme producing strain, Bacillus macerans 17011 tFERM BP No. 56 , was inoculated on a culture CpH 7.5 comprising glucose 1.0 , starch 1.0 , peptone 1.0t, meat extract 0.5 , and NaCt 0.5 and cultivated at 320C for 24 hours to provide a seed solution. This seed solution was inoculated on a fermentation medium CpH 7.5 comprising bran 3.0t, ammonium sulfate 0.5 , and CaCO3 0.5t in a proportion of 5 and cultured at 370C for 48 hours while aerating and stirring by the use of a 20 liter volute JarFermentor . After the cultivation was completed, the cultured broth was filtered to obtain a filtrate.The thus obtained filtrate was cooled, and starch was added thereto in an amount of 1 100 tw v of the filtrate. The resulting mixture was stirred at 5tC for 20 hours to allow the cyclodextrin synthesizing enzyme to be adsorbed on the starch. Then, the mixture was subjected to centrifugal separation to separate the starch with the enzyme adsorbed thereon. The starch with the enzyme adsorbed thereon was freeze dried to obtain Enzyme K. A part of the freeze dried powder Enzyme K was taken, and water was added thereto in an amount of 5 1 v w of the freeze dri ed powder. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes while heating at 500C and filtered. The filtrate thus obtained was again freezedried to obtain Enzyme L. ii Male wistar rats 138 to 147 g Cgroups of six rats were deprived of food for 24 hours. At the end of the period, starch was orally administered in an amount of 1 g kg, and at the same time, Enzymes K and L prepared above were administered, respectively, 30 minutes after the administration, blood samples were collected, and the blood glucose level was determined. The results are shown in Table 6 1. It can be seen from Table 6 1 that with the group to which Enzyme K or L was administered, the blood glucose level was significantly lowered compared with the control group to which starch alone was administered. TABLE 6 1 Blood Glucose Level Group after 30 Minutes mg dg Control 175 Group administered with 134 Enzyme K 30 mg kg Group administered with 129 Enzyme L 1 mg kg 129 The value is an average value for each group of six rats. iii In the same manner as in Cii above except that 2 g kg of sucrose was orally administered in place of starch, the effects of Enzyme K and Enzyme L were examined. The results are shown in Table 6 2. As can be seen from Table 6 2, with the group to which Enzyme K or Enzyme L was administered, the blood glucose level was markedly reduced compared with the control group to which only sucrose was administered. TABLE 6 2 Blood Glucose Level Group after 30 Minutes CmgIdt Control 172 Group administered with 141 Enzyme K 30 mg kg Group administered with 138 Enzyme L Cl mg kg The blood glucose level is an average value for each group of six rats. EXAMPLE 10 Ci A cyclodextrin synthesizing enzyme producing strain, Bacillus stearothermophilus IAM 1035, was inoculated on a culture medium CpH 7.5 containing glucose 1.0 , starch 1.0 , peptone 1.0 , meat extract 0.5S, and NaCt 0.58 and aerobically cultivated at 400C for 48 hours. After the cultivation was completed, the cultured broth was filtered.The thus obtained filtrate was cooled, and starch was then added thereto in an amount of 1 100 tw v of the filtrate. The resulting mixture was stirred for 12 hours while cooling at 50C to allow the cyclodextrin synthesizing enzyme to be adsorbed on the starch. The starch with the enzyme adsorbed thereon was separated by centrifugal separation and freeze dried to obtain Enzyme M. ii The blood glucose level lowering effect ofEnzyme M was examined by the same method as in Example 9 With the control group to which starch alone was administered, the blood glucose level after 30 minutes was 170 mg dt, whereas the blood glucose level of the group to which Enzyme M was administered in an amount of 100 mg kg was significantly reduced to 137 mg dt Cthe values are average values for each group of six rats . EXAMPLE 11 Ci A dextransucrase producing strain, Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B 1299, was aerobically cultured on a culture medium pH 7.4 containing sucrose 25, corn steep liquor 2 , K2HPO4 0.2 , MgSO4.7H2O 0.01 , FeSO4.7H2O 0.001 , MnCt2 4H2O 0.001 , and NaCt 0.001 at 26 C for 30 hours. After the cultivation was completed, a culture solution was filtered and separated into a filtrate and a cell fraction. A part of the filtrate was treated in the same manner as in the preparation of Enzyme A in Example l ti , whereby Enzyme N was obtained. Cii Male ICR mice C18 to 20 g Cgroups of five mice were deprived of food for 24 hours, and sucrose was orally administered in an amount of 2.5 g kg. At the same time, Enzyme N and a glucosidase inhibiting agent were orally administered under the conditions shown inTable 7. After 15 minutes and 30 minutes, blood samples were collected, and the blood glucose level was determined. The results are shown in Table 7. When Enzyme N is used in combination with Bay g 5421. produced byBayer, West Germany or Tris produced by Merk 4 Co.,U.S.A. , the blood glucose lowering effect is increased compared with the cases that Enzyme N, Bay g 5421 andTris are used separately.
