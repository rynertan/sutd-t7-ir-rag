# Modified cracking catalyst, process for passivating deactivating metals on a used craching catalyst and a process for cracking a hydrocarbon feedstock.

## Abstract
A novel cracking catalyst, a method of preparing same and an improved hydrocarbon cracking process are provided wherein adverse effects of metals such as nickel, vanadium and iron in the cracking catalyst are precluded or mitigated by contacting the cracking catalyst with at least one treating agent selected from the group consisting of elemental tellurium, oxides of tellurium and compounds convertible to elemental tellurium or oxide thereof during cracking or catalyst regeneration, whereby to said cracking catalyst is added a modifying amount of said treating agent.
