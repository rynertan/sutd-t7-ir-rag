## Description
An apparatus for withdrawing and depositing valuable papersTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to an apparatus for the withdrawal and or the deposit of valuable papers, such as bank notes, cheques, etc., particularly intended for use by vehicle carried customers, hereinafter referred to as vehicular customers.BACKGROUND PRIOR ARTThere are known to the art apparatus which comprise a withdrawal opening and or a deposit opening accessible to a customer, transport means effective to transport valuable documents, papers, etc., between a storage space and the withdrawal opening and or the deposit opening, and requisite button banks, card readers, detecting sensing and signalling means for enabling appropriate transportation of valuable papers to and from the withdrawal and or deposit opening.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONWithdrawal apparatus, or bank note dispensing apparatus, intended for vehicular customers are encumbered with a number of drawbacks. In the case of certain apparatus of this kind, it is necessary for the driver of a vehicle to stop in the close proximity of the apparatus in order to be able to reach the same while remaining seated in his her vehicle, with the accompanying risk of causing damage to the vehicle. In addition, the procedures which must be carried out, e.g. insertion of a bankers card, insertion of a personal code and the sum required, removal of the card and the cash and the receipt, cannot be performed in comfort whilst seated in a vehicle. These difficulties are accentuated when the vehicle is a lefthand drive vehicle and the driver is right handed. Another drawback with known apparatus of this kind is that dispensing and or deposit apparatus intended mainly for vehicular customers are positioned at such a low level as to cause discomfort when used by pedestrian customers, who must stand in front of the apparatus when making a withdrawal or a deposit. The object of the invention is to eliminate these drawbacks and disadvantages.Accordingly, there is provided in accordance with the invention an apparatus for the withdrawal and or deposit of valuable papers and intended chiefly for use by vehicular customers, said apparatus including an extendable arm construction which is provided at its free end with a withdrawal and or deposit opening, button banks and a card insertion aperture. Outward extension of the arm is contingent on the presence of a vehicular customer in front of the apparatus. The extent to which the arm is extended, the height of the free end of the arm above a given horizontal level and the lateral angle of the arm relative to the vertical can be controlled in correspondence with the presence of the customer as the arm is extended, by means of a sensor arrangement provided in the free end of the arm thermal radiation .Other characteristic features of the invention are disclosed in the following claims.The apparatus described briefly above can be placed in a fixed location at a height convenient for a standing person of average height, and, through the agency of the flexible and individually adaptable arm, can be manipulated comfortably by a vehicular customer, irrespective of where the customer stops his her vehicle in front of the apparatus, within certain limits of course.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates an apparatus according to the invention in its inactive, rest position Figure 2 illustrates the apparatus with the arm extended to the proximity of a customer Figure 3 illustrates the free end of the extended arm in detail andFigure 4 is a plan view of the apparatus illustrated inFigure 3.PREFERRED EMBODIMENTFigure 1 illustrates an apparatus 10 intended for the withdrawal of bank notes, i.e. a bank note dispensing apparatus, and shows the apparatus in its inactive mode.The apparatus is intended for vehicular customers, i.e.customers who remain seated in their automobile when using the apparatus, and is placed at a height above ground level such that its button banks, card insert aperture and withdrawal opening can be reached comfortably by the driver of a vehicle 11 parked in front of the apparatus.As described hereinafter, the apparatus 10 may alternatively be placed at a higher level, so that it can be operated comfortably by a pedestrian customer while standing upright in front of the apparatus.In addition to having button banks, card reader and a withdrawal opening, the apparatus also incorporates a transport mechanism effective to transport bank notes from a storage station 20 in Figure 2 located within the apparatus, and detecting and signalling means which enable bank notes to be fed reliably and correctly from the storage station to the withdrawal opening. These components and arrangements are well known to the art, and are disclosed for example in U.S. Patent Specification 4,066,253, and hence will not be described in further detail.As described in more detail hereinafter, the apparatus 10 has a telescopically extendable arm and a further sens ing or detecting means for controlling movement of the arm, and therewith its free length and the angle of the arm relative to the vertical, in dependence on the presence of a vehicular customer in front of the apparatus.This further detecting means comprises two units, of which one is constructed to sense the presence of a vehicle in front of the apparatus and to activate the other of said units in response thereto. The vehicle sensing unit is indicated in Figure 1 by a broken line and is referenced 12.Figure 2 illustrates the situation in which the vehiclesensor 12 has detected the presence of the vehicle 11 in front of the apparatus 10 and has activated the aforesaid other unit 30 in Figure 3 , so as to cause the arm 101 to be extended to a position in which the driver of the vehicle 11 can comfortably reach the free end of said arm.The apparatus is mounted in a wall 21, within which the storage station 20 safe is located. In the Figure 2 embodiment, the telescopically extendable arm 101 is shown to be extended approximately horizontally, although the arm can also be raised and lowered somewhat at an angle to the horizontal, as indicated by the positions referenced 101 and 101 . This raising and lowering of the arm in the vertical plane is made possible by a bellow construction 102 in the arm 101, and is controlled by the unit 30 in the detector means, in response to heat radiated from the customer. As beforementioned, the bank note dispensing apparatus 10 is placed at a height which can be reached comfortably by a vehicular passenger. When the apparatus is normally intended for pedestrian customers, it may be suitably to place the apparatus on a higher level. In the case of a pedestrian customer standing in front of the apparatus, the arm will extend to the position shown in Figure 1 and will remain in this position, while the customers makes his her withdrawal. In the case of a vehicular customer, however, the arm will extend approximately to the position referenced 101 .In Figure 3 the arm 101 is shown to be brought to a position in which it can be reached comfortably by the customer seated in the vehicle 11 Figure 1 , this customer having already inserted the amount required through the illustrated upper button bank 32, and has proved his hdr identity by inserting his her bankers card in the card reader 33 shown to the right, and has inserted his her personal code number through the lower button bank 34.The ordered number of bank notes 31 has been fed to the withdrawal opening 35, and is ready to be removed therefrom. Removal of the bank notes from the withdrawal opening is detected by a third detecting means, which immediately initiates and steers rcturn oveent of arm 101 to its inactive, starting position Figure 1 .The detecting means 12 arranged in the road and effective to sense or detect the presence of a vehicle can be replaced with a unit having a similar function arranged on the free end of the arm 101, i.e. a unit which detects the arrival of a vehicle, and activates the unit 30 for controlling movement of the arm 101.As illustrated in Figure 4, the arm 101 can also be moved sideways, as shown by the arm positions referenced 101 and 101 . The further detecting means 12 30 is arranged to control extension of the arm 101, so that the arm is extended to a suitable length either perpendicularly from the wall, obliquely to the left or to the right, depending on the position of the vehicle in front of the apparatus.Many variants of the invention are conceivable. For example, the further detecting means 12 may be constructed such that in the presence of a vehicle there is activated a start means which can be reached by a customer seated in the vehicle. When the start means is activated by the customer e.g. a button is pressed the arm is extended outwardly, either through a constant distance 1 in Figure 4 or to a position in which the free length of the arm and the respective angles of the arm in the horizontal and vertical planes are controlled by the presence of the customer through the detecting means by the heat radiated from the customer . Guide means for steering an object towards a heat source are known per se and need not therefore be described here.Preferably, the outer edge of the free end of the arm comprises a strip of resilient soft material, such as rubber, having incorporated therein a pressure sensitive means effective to stop outward movement of the arm when meeting a mechanical obstacle wing mirror of the vehicle or a like obstacle during said outward movements of the arm.In the aforegoing the invention has been described with reference to an apparatus by means of which a customer can make a withdrawal from his her account, i.e. a banknote dispensing apparatus. It will be understood, however, that the invention can also be applied in apparatus intended for depositing bank notes or other valuable papers, or in apparatus which are intended both for withdrawal and depositing purposes, without departing from the scope of the invention. Such complex apparatus are known per se from, for example, the U.S Patent Specification 4,447,714. A further modification resides in the provision of a handle on the free end of the extendable arm 101, by means of which handle the arm can be extended towards a vehicle located in front of the apparatus. Normally, the arm is latched in its inwardly inserted position, so as to prevent it from being extended by vandals and the like. This latch is only released when a passing vehicle has activated the unit 12 of the further detecting means, therewith enabling the driver of the vehicle to extend the arm and carry out his her withdrawal. When extending the arm a spring is tensioned, which upon completion of the withdrawal or deposit is automatically released and therewith causes the arm to be retracted to its starting position. When this modification is incorporated, the aforedescribed further unit 30 becomes obsolete. Normally, sideways movement of the arm is restricted to a sector which can be considered to represent a comfortable manouvering and gripping position for a vehicular passenger, the limit of this sideways movement being determined by a safety latch. Should, however, the pressure on the arm 101 exceed a pre determined value for some reason or other, for example, because the vehicle is driven away before the arm has been retracted, the latch is released and the arm will accompany movement of the vehicle, so as to avoid damage to the vehicle and to the arm.
