# Subsurface avalanche breakdown Zener diode.

## Abstract
This zener diode is fabricated by a conventional CMOS device fabricating process whereby an entire electronic circuit can be laid down in one overall process. A semiconductor substrate 10 of one conductivity type has an elongate region 12 of semiconductor material of the opposite conductivity type diffused to a predetermined depth to form a well, centrally of which a region 18 of enhanced conductivity material of the opposite conductivity type is diffused to prearranged depth less than the predetermined depth. Semiconductor material of the one conductivity type is diffused into a pair of elongate regions 14, 16 spaced apart from, and with one on each side of, the first elongate region 12 while at the same time a quantity of the same material is diffused into the substrate between the pair of regions 14, 16 and over the central region 18 and doped more heavily than the substrate material to convert the upper part of the central region 18 and the well 12 to the opposite conductivity type for a substantial depth into the well whereby a P N junction is formed completely beneath the surface of the substrate. One contact 22 for the zener diode is made to the well region 12 outside the conductivity type converted part of the well. The other contact 24 is made to one 16 of the pair of regions 14, 16 .
