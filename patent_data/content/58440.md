# Blood collection unit.

## Abstract
A blood collection unit has a primary tube 9 of narrow bore 8 hermetically and concentrically assembled to a secondary tube 14 of larger diameter either by a plunger 11 attached to the primary tube and on which the secon dary tube is slidably mounted or by the skirt 33 of a stopper 16 closing both tubes. One of the tubes is closed by a stopper of fitting over form, the two tubes forming a closed communicating space into which a blood sample is intro duced through a double ended needle, 2a, 2b , passing into one of the tubes prior to passing into the other tube. For sedimentation rate determinations, the plunger system can be operated either with or without the closed communicating space under vacuum. Progressive entry of blood into the system is controlled by the narrow bore primary tube 9 .
