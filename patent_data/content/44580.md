# Additional rotating cutters in a pick up wagon.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an agricultural implement, particularly a pick up wagon 3 comprising a pick up member 5 for picking up crop lying on the ground, an advance mechanism 10 located behind the pick up member 5 , viewed in the intended direction of displacement of the crop and cutters 22 arranged behind the advance mechan ism 10 , between which cutters the crop can be passed on with the aid of the advance mechanism whereby the advance mechanism 10 comprises a plurality of additional cutters 7 8 adapted to rotate about a rotary axis during operation so that these rotating cutters 7 8 displace the crop in the direction towards the first mentioned cutters 22 and fingers 15 adapted to reciprocate during operation and pushing the crop also in the direction towards the first mentioned cutters during operation, the arrangement being such that the rotating cutters 8 move in between the reciprocating fingers 15 .
