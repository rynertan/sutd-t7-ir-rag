TITLE Ultrapure Crystalline Silica Polymorphs And Process For The Preparation Thereof BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to several ultrapure crystalline silica polymorphs, i.e., those containing essentially only silicon and oxygen therein and to a process of producing silica polymorphs which employs a relatively pure organosilicon as a source of silica and a relatively pure template.Description of the Prior Art Crystalline aluminosilicates, commonly referred to as zeolites, are known as catalysts for reactions such as disproportionation and methylation of toluene.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to certain types of ultrapure silica polymorphs several of which have a pentasil type structure and to a process for producing these and several other types of ultrapure silica polymorphs. The polymorphs claimed herein consist essentially of silicon and oxygen with other metals except the alkali metals being essentially absent, i.e., metal free. For example, the aluminum content as Al is less than about 55 ppm. The polymorphs which have a density of at least about 1.83 grams cc exhibit essentially no catalytic activity but are uniquely adapted to the introduction of catalytically active sites which are not a part of the framework of the silica.These and other pure polymorphs are prepared by employing essentially metal free, e.g., aluminum free, organosilicon compounds having the formulaEMI5.1 wherein A is a group selected from the class consisting of H, OH, R1, OR2, C1, phenoxy, andEMI5.2 X, Y and Z are the same or different and are groups selected from the class consisting of R4, OR5 phenoxy and phenyl and wherein one of the groups is additionally hydroxyl R1 5 are the same or different and are selected from the class consisting of alkyl groups having 1 10 carbon atoms and cycloalkyl groups having 5 10 carbon atoms, m is an integer of 1 10 and n is an integer of 1 5 preferably 1 2. An aqueous basic reaction medium having a pH in the range 9.5 13.8 and a temperature greater than 1000C and less than 3000C, preferably in the range 140 200 C, is employed along with a relatively pure template compound. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The crystalline silicas of the present invention are ultrapure silica polymorphs consisting essentially of only silica and oxygen. Except for the alkali metals which are readily removed from the present silica polymorphs, the polymorphs are essentially free of other metals. Metal such as aluminum which is present in significant amounts in inorganic sources of silica and is difficult to remove therefrom is present at a level of less than 55 ppm in the polymorphs of the present invention.Frequently aluminum is also present in organosilicon compounds in amounts sufficient to introduce enough metal into the polymorph to render it catalytically active. Other metals are not added to the present process and therefore are believed not to be present in significant amounts. However, if present, they can be removed from the organosilicon or template by methods apparent to those skilled in the art. The characteristics of the silicas vary depending upon the conditions employed in the preparation, the source of silica and the template compound. All the silicas of the present invention exhibit essentially no surface acidity according to the tests hereinafter described and are essentially catalytically inactive in hydrocarbon reactions where aluminum containing silicas are active. The silica polymorphs prepared according to the process of the present invention readily sorb organics from an aqueous solution thereof. The measurements of density, refractive index and surface area of the silica polymorphs as reported herein in each instance were taken after the polymorph had been calcined in air at about 5500C for at least four hours. X ray diffraction measurements were taken before and after calcination as noted. One form of the silica polymorph comprises linked tetrahedra of five membered and six membered rings which form channels of ten membered rings of silicon oxygen atoms. This microporous crystalline polymorph is believed to have straight and zigzag channels in the range of 5.0 6.5 t in diameter. It has a density of about 1.85 grams cc, a refractive index of about 1.38 and a surface area of 350 450 m2 gram. This silica is hydrophobic, organophilic, has essentially no ion exchange properties and selectively sorbs organic molecules from aqueous ionic solutions. This is the type of silica polymorph which is prepared according toExample 1. In the as synthesized form the silica has the X ray diffraction pattern set forth in Table I and after calcination as described above the pattern set forth in Table II.The X ray diffraction measurements were obtained with CuKa radiation at 40 Kev 4OmA on a Phillips diffractomer having a scintillation counter and compensating slit containing 12.5 mm of irradiated sample 3 mils in thickness.

This microporous crystalline silica polymorph after calcination at about 5500C in air for at least four hours, exhibits a density of about 1.83 grams cc, a refractive index of about 1.47, and a surface area of 400 500 m2 gram.

The essential absence of acidity on the surface of the silica can be especially valuable in certain applications where the presence of acid would interfere with the compound being sorbed. This surface acidity is readily determined using Hammett indicators according to the following general procedure. Approximately 2 mg portions of the following indicators are added to separate 250 ml portions of dry toluene anthraquinone pKa 8.2 , benzalacetophenone Chalcone, pKa 5.6 , dicinnamalacetone pKa 3 , 2 amino 5 azotoluene pKa 2 , 4 phenylazonaphthylamine pKa 4 .The indicated pKa at which indicators change color is approximate. About 300 mg sample is calcined in a furnace at 4500 to 5500C for 3 hours in a stream of dry air. The sample is removed from the furnace and sealed in a container while still hot, i.e., not less than about 1500C. About 50 mg portions are transferred to dried vials under dry nitrogen atmosphere, for example, in a glove bag or in a dry box. Two to three milliliters of indicator solutions are added to each of the vials and any color change is recorded. Except in the case where there is some reaction of the indicator with the silica, all the indicators set forth above will indicate an absence of surface acidity in the silica polymorphs of the present invention. The exception can be disregarded since it will not be confirmed by the remaining indicators. The silica polymorphs of the present invention are made by heating a reaction mixture comprising water, an organosilicon compound and alkylammonium ion containing compound and optionally a dispersing agent under hydrothermal conditions at a pH of at least 7.1 and preferably in the range of 9.5 13.8. The basicity can be controlled by several methods. An alkylammonium hydroxide can be used alone, or in combination with an alkylammonium halide or a diamine, e.g., hexamethylenediamine to provide basicity. Ammonium hydroxide and an alkylammonium halide is also an acceptable combination. Alkali metal hydroxides can be used to supply basicity but are not preferred because, unlike the bases previously described, the residual alkali metal requires an additional processing scheme for removal from the polymorph and can be a source of impurities. The reaction times and the temperatures are not critical so long as sufficient time at elevated temperature is provided to permit the formation of the crystalline silicas. Usually the reaction temperature can vary from 100 3000C but preferably, is maintained in the range of 140 2000C. The reaction time can be as long as practical but, preferably, does not exceed 50 100 hours. In an especially preferred embodiment a continuous reaction is employed with the result that the time can be reduced to less than about one hour. After reaction the product is separated from the liquid, e.g., by filtration then washed and dried according to known techniques prior to further processing. Numerous compounds are suitable as templates for the formation of the silica polymorphs provided that the template, except for alkali metal, is essentially metal free. The preferred compounds contain alkylammonium cations which cations are defined by the formulaEMI15.1 wherein the groups represented by R are the same or different and consisting of alkyl groups containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferably R is methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl and mixtures thereof. Operable anions include hydroxide and halide, e.g., chloride.Illustrative compounds include tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, and the salts corresponding to the aforesaid hydroxides, particularly the chloride, iodide and bromide salts, for example, tetrapropylammonium bromide. The quaternary cation can be supplied to the reaction mixture per se or can be generated in situ. Additional templates include compounds wherein the nitrogen atom is replaced by phosphorus in the above formula and diamines having the formula NH2 CH2 nNH2 wherein n 2 12 such as ethylenediamine and hexamethylenediamine.Additional template compounds should be apparent to those skilled in the art. For most systems any of the above described substituent groups on the alkylammonium cation will perform satisfactorily but it is preferred to employ alkylammonium cations having substituent groups of more than two carbon atoms in mixture with a tetraethylammonium cation. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, and hexamethylenediamine are preferred template compounds. Metal contamination of the silica product can occur if the template compound is not sufficiently pure. At least a part of any metal such as aluminum in the alkylammonium compound are assimulated into the silica polymorph and therefore must be removed before reaction. For example, aluminum in tetrapropylammonium hydroxide is readily removed as follows. Approximately 30 parts of 208 aqueous tetrapropylammonium hydroxide TPNOH containing 2 ppm of aluminum were adjusted to pH of 8.5 with pure aqueous HCl following which the solution was stirred and refluxed with 10 parts of amorphous silica at 950C overnight. The mixture was then filtered. The filtrate containing the template compound had essentially no aluminum 0.1 ppm therein. Other methods for removing metals from the template source should be apparent to those skilled in the art. Diamine can be readily purified by distillation. Alkylammonium salts can be purified as described by S. tindenbaum and G. E. Boyd in references 8 16 in the article Osmotic and ActivityCoefficients for the Symmetrical TetraalkylammoniumHalides in Aqueous Solution at 250C , J. Phys. Chem.68, 911 1964 . The organosilicons which are the source of silica in the present invention have the formulaEMI17.1 wherein A is a group selected from the class consisting of H, OH, R1, OR2, C1, phenoxy, andEMI17.2 X, Y and Z are the same or different and are groups selected from the class consisting of R4, OR5, phenoxy and phenyl and wherein one of the groups is additionally hydroxyl R1 5 are the same or different and are selected from the class consisting of alkyl groups having 1 10 carbon atoms and cycloalkyl groups having 5 10 carbon atoms, m is an integer of 1 10 and n is an integer of 1 5 preferably 1 2. Illustrative of operable organosilicon compounds include tetramethyl orthosilicate, tetraethyl orthosilicate, tetra n propyl orthosilicate, tetra n butyl orthosilicate, a mixture composed of ethylpolysilicates, tetra 2 ethylhexyl orthosilicate, triethoxysilane, triphenylhydroxysilane, triethoxychlorosilane, triethoxyphenylsilane, tetraethylsilane, p t butylphenethyldimethylchlorosilane, diphenyldihydroxysilane, hexamethyldisiloxane, triethoxymethylsilane, tetraisobutyl orthosilicate, triamylhydroxysilane, triisoamylhydroxysilane, tetraphenoxysilane, tripentoxyhydroxysilane, tetracosapentyloxyhendecasiloxane and tetradecabutylhexasiloxane. Generally the higher molecular weight compounds should be hydrolizable under reaction conditions.Tetramethyl orthosilicate, tetraethyl orthosilicate, ethylpolysilicates, hexamethyldisiloxane, tetrapropyl orthosilicate tetra 2 ethylhexyl orthosilicate, triethyloxysilane, triethoxychlorosilane, tetraethylsilane are preferred silicon sources. Aluminum which is present in catalytically significant amounts in silicas prepared from inorganic silicates, for example, fumed silica and colloidal silica is extremely difficult to completely remove therefrom. By contrast, aluminum is readily removed from the present organosilicon compounds by simple unit operations, e.g., by distillation. For example, 100 parts of tetraethyl orthosilicate containing 5 parts of aluminum isopropylate aluminum concentration 5532 ppm as Al were distilled at a pot temperature of 1660C and a head temperature of 1680C utilizing internal reflux to provide a distillate containing essentially no aluminum 0.1 ppm . Other methods for removing metals from the silicon source should be apparent to those skilled in the art. Dispersing agents can be employed in the present process so long as they do not participate in the reaction to a degree that the desirable characteristics of the silica polymorphs are reduced. Alcohols having from 1 6 carbon atoms are quite suitable as dispersing agents. Examples of such alcohols include methanol, ethanol n propanol, n butanol, n pentanol, n hexanol and their isomers. Dispersing agents are preferably employed when the silicon source is particularly non polar. Other operable dispersing agents should be apparent to those skilled in the art. The relative ratios of reactants can vary over rather wide limits but usually the relative amounts of the silicon source compound S , the template compound T , water H2O , and, optionally, alcohol A expressed as mole ranges areS H20 of 0.005 5 and preferably 0.01 0.1, T S of 0.01 10 and preferably 0.02 1 and A H2O of 0 5 and preferably 0.02 1.

The resultant solution was charged to a pressure reactor indicated. The reactor was sealed and the temperature of its contents was raised slowly to 1600C with stirring 100 rpm and held at 1600C with stirring for the time indicated under autogeneous pressure. Hastelloy C or other essentially inert metals are the preferred materials of construction for the reactor. In Examples 3, 13, 14 and 16 the materials were charged to a bottle constructed ofTeflons and the bottle was placed in an autoclave.The contents of the bottles were not agitated during the reaction period. The solid crystalline product was recovered by filtration and washed three times, each time with a volume of water equal to the volume of solids following which the washed material was dried at 950C in a nitrogen atmosphere. The X ray diffraction pattern was measured before and after calcination in air at about 5500C for about four hours. Analysis of the calcined product indicated the presence of less than the indicated amount of aluminum. Approximately 1.8 parts of the calcined activated silica polymorph of Example 1, prepared as above were placed in a one inch diameter quartz reactor inserted in a split tube furnace and tested for its activity in toluene disproportionation, toluene methylation, xylene isomerization and conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons under conditions which if employed with an active catalyst would indicate significant reaction. The same amount of the polymorphs of Examples 6, 9 and 12 was tested as previously described for toluene methylation. In no case did any of the silica polymorphs show any catalytic activity. In addition to the silicon source compounds set forth in Table TX, triethoxysilane, tetra 2 ethylhexyl orthosilicate, triethoxyphenylsilane, diphenyldihydroxysilane, hexamethyldisiloxane, triethoxymethylsilane, p t butylphenethyld imethylchloros ilane, tetraethylsilane, tetraphenoxysilane and hydroxytriphenylsilane produced crystalline silica polymorphs when used in the present process. Solutions as set forth in Table X were prepared and combined with indicated amount of silica polymorph of Example 1. The mixture was maintained at room temperature for approximately 16 hours with occasional shaking. The supernatent liquid was analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the amount of organic sorbed by the silica polymorph.The results are given in Table X.

A calcined polymorph similar to that of Example 1 0.2 gm was added to 1.4 grams of each standard solution. Each mixture was kept at room temperature without stirring overnight. Ethanol and ammonia in each supernatant liquid were analyzed. Essentially no ammonia was sorbed while 53 and 64 of the available ethanol respectively was sorbed. This is further evidence of the absence of surface acidity and cation exchange properties. Solutions as set forth in Table XI were prepared and combined with the indicated amount of the silica polymorph of Example 12. The mixture was maintained at room temperature for about 2 3 days following which the supernatent liquid was analyzed as before. The results are reported in Table XI.
