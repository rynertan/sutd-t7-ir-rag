## Description
MEDIUM FOR STORING BLOOD PLATELETS The present invention relates to methods and media for the storage of blood platelets, and more particularly to methods and media for storing those blood platelets from about l80 300C., preferably in the range of about 20e 240C., and even more preferably at about 220C. Platelets are obtained as a by product from whole blood donations and from plateletpheresis procedures. Typically, they are now stored in their own plasma within a plastic container whose walls are permeable to atmospheric gases. The plasma associated with these platelets normally contains all the ingredients of normal plasma, plus citrate, which is added as an anti coagant, and dextrose at 5 times the physiologic level. The increased dextrose is added for the benefit of red cells which require it during storage, and is generally accepted to be required for platelet storage as well. In routine blood banking practice, donations of a unit of blood 450 ml into 67.5 anti coagulant are processed by centrifugation into three fractions red cells, plasma, and platelets. The volume of packed red cells from a unit is approximately 180 ml with a remaining volume of plasma and anti coagulant of about 337.5 ml.As used in the remainder of this application, the term plasma includes any anti coagulant which has been added thereto at the time of its initial collection. The red cells referred to as packed red cells are typically suspended in approximately 47.5 ml of plasma. Platelets are suspended in approximately 5Q ml of plasma. This platelet containing product is typically referred to as platelet concentrate. The remaining 240 ml of plasma is frozen as fresh frozen plasma. Recent advances have allowed blood banks to store platelet concentrates at 220C. for five days. SeeMurphy et al, Improved Storage of Platelets forTransfusion in a New Container , Blood 60 1 194 200 1982 Simon et al, Extension of Platelet ConcentrateStorage , Transfusion, 23 3 207 212 1983 . The extended storage of platelets at 220C. provides the flexibility to allow inventory planning so that platelets can be available at widely dispersed sites when needed. However, the above described storage procedure requires that platelets be suspended in 50 ml plasma which is then infused into the patient along with the platelets. There are disadvantages to storing platelets in large volumes of plasma which are then infused into a recipient. Diseases may be transmitted by plasma infusion.It is certain that hepitatis B and nonA, nonB hepitatis may be transmitted by such plasma infusions. It is also likely that the newly recognized acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS may be transmitted through plasma infusion.Patients may also exhibit allergic reactions to plasma which are at least annoying, and occasionally fatal.Furthermore, plasma is valuable because it can be fractionated into its components such albumin and coagulation factors for treatment of specific patients.A milliliter of plasma is worth 4 5 cents. Therefore, the plasma used t suspend platelets is worth as much as 2.50 per unit. Since 4 million units of platelets are administered yearly in the United States, the use of plasma as a storage medium for platelets may waste up to 10 million annually of plasma. Furthermore, the use of platelets in the United States has been increasing as a general trend. A great deal is known about human platelet cells.General papers describing techniques materials and methods for storage of blood platelets are described by Murphy et al in Improved Storage of Platelets for Transfusion in aNew Container, Blood 60 1 , July, 1982 by Murphy in The Preparation and Storage of Platelets for Transfusion Mammon, Barnheart, Lusher and Walsh, PJD Publications Ltd.,Westbury, New York 1980 by Murphy in PlateletTransfusion , Progress in Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Vol. III, Edited by Theodore H.

There are, of course, many culture media and or physiologic solutions which are deemed acceptable for use in maintaining and or culturing vetebrate cells. Such solutions include Earle s solution a tissue culture medium Fonio s solution used for stained smears of blood platelets Gey s solution for culturing animal cells Hank s solution for culturing animal cells Heyem s solution a blood diluent used prior to counting red blood cells Krebs Ringers solution a modification of Ringers solution prepared by mixing NaCl, KC1, Caul3, MgSO4, and phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 lactated Ringers solution containing NaCl, sodium lactate, CaCl2 dihydrate and KC1 in distilled water Locke s solution for culturing animal cells Locke Ringer solution containing NaCl, CaC12, KC1, MgC12, NaHCO3, glucose and water Ringers solution resembling blood serum and its salt constituents, containing 8.6 grams of NaCl, 0.3gms of KC1 and 0.33 gms of Caul2 in each thousand milliliters in of distilled water, used topically for burns and wounds or used in combination with naturally occurring body substances, e.g., blood serum, tissue abstracts and or more complex chemically defined nuclear solutions for culturing animal cells and Tyrode s solution a modified Locke s solution .See Stedman s Medical Dictionary, pp. 1300 1301, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, Maryland 1982 . The maintenance and or culturing of live vetebrate cells creates different problems depending upon the particular type of cells employed. It is known, for example, that blood cells, such as platelets, have many metabolic properties similar to those of certain other types of cells. In Blood 30 151 1967 , for example, it is suggested that the metabolic properties of blood cells are similar in some respects to those of tumor cells.On the other hand, there exists a considerable body of prior art directed specifically to the problem of storing stable suspensions of blood cells, such as blood platelets.Prior work on the storage of blood platelets, has shown that the duration of platelet storage is limited by the continuing production of lactic acid from dextrose by the platelets. Although this provides energy for the platelets, the lactic acid acidifies the medium, which acidity eventually destroys the platelets. It has also been shown that platelets consume oxygen during storage for energy production, the end product of which process is a gas, CO2, which, unlike lactic acid, can leave the container through the plastic walls in which it is normally stored. The production of CO2 does not acidify the storage medium for these platelets. In addition to the glycolysis of dextrose, fatty acids and amino acids typically present in the plasma may be used as substrates for oxidative metabolism of stored platelet cells. Various techniques are disclosed in the patent literature relating to the fractionation of blood into useful end products. In British Patent 1,283,273, a method and apparatus for separating plasma from whole blood to produce a plasma end product is disclosed wherein the remaining blood fractions are returned to a donor.

In U.S. 4,152,208 Cartaya a variety of leucocyte preservative solutions and the use of such solutions in blood fractionation procedures is disclosed, including Eagles MEM columns 3 and 4 containing inter alia, glutamine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, phosphates and sodium and potassium chlorides, for use in conjunction with anti coagulants such as sodium citrate. See also U.S. 4,205,126 Cartaya . U.S. PatentNo. 3,753,357 Schwartz broadly discloses various pre servative or culture media useful in conjunction with the storage of blood cells. As discussed hereinafter, one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention utilizes a synthetic platelet storage medium to which glutamine has been added.Although not related to the storage or culturing of blood cells, the following publications do disclose that glutamine may be a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation in a certain type of cancer cells, namely, HeLa cells. See nThe Continuous Growth of Vetebrate Cells in the Absence of Sugar by Wice et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 256 15 7812 7819 1981 The Penetose Cycle , byReitzer et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 255 12 5616 5626 1980 and Evidence that Glutamine, Not Sugar is the Major Energy Source for Cultured HeLa Cells , byReitzer et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 254 8 2669 2676 1979 . See also Kuchler, Biochemical Methods and Cell Cutural and Virology, Halstead Press at pages 83, 87 88, 1977 . Notwithstanding the considerable work conducted in this area, a need still exists for a simple safe, inexpensive method for storing human blood platelets in a viable condition while increasing the amount of blood plasma which is freed for other uses. The present invention provides a novel method and storage medium for storing platelets in a viable condition for three to seven days, preferably at least about five days, at temperatures from about 180 300C., especially from about 200 240C. and preferably at about 220C.The methods of the present invention comprises the steps of providing a platelet rich suspension of platelets in blood plasma extracting supernatant plasma from that suspension to leave between about 1 to 15 mls of plasma per unit of blood platelets with those platelets to produce a concentrated platelet button adding a buffered,Ringers type citrate solution to said concentrated platelet button agitating the resultant solution to resuspend the platelets to provide a synthetic suspension of those platelets and storing that synthetic suspension in an oxygen permeable container at about 220C. until needed for use.The preferred Ringers citrate solution is buffered to maintain the pH of a unit of platelets and not more than 15 mls of associated plasma at a pH in excess of 6.2 during seven days of storage with 60 ml per unit of this medium in an oxygen permeable container maintained at 220C. A preferred alternate blood platelet storage medium further comprises a platelet permeable non glycolytic substrate for oxidative phosphorylation, such as glutamine.Alternative substrates include oxaloacetate, malate, fumarate, succinate, alpha ketogluterate, oxalosuccinate, isocitrate, cis aconitate, and or an amino acid which may be transformed to such citric acid cycle intermediates such as glutamic or aspartic acids. Further alternate substrates include amino acids and fatty acids which give rise to acetyl CoA, including leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, acetoacetic acid, acetone, and those fatty acids which may be metabolized by beta oxidation. Particularly preferred at the present time is the addition of glutamine as a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. It has been found that the addition of glutamine as a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation may extend the active metabolism of stored platelets to thereby extend their viability for as long as seven days. Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is the provision of a novel method of processing and storing human blood platelets. A further object of the present invention is the provision of a novel platelet storage medium which will free substantial amounts of natural plasma for other uses. These and further objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following more detailed description. A primary object of the present invention is the provision of a disease free artificial storage medium for platelets which will permit storage for at least five days at a temperature of from about 180 300C., preferably at about 200 240C and most preferably at about 220C.At the end of the storage, the platelets must be viable.By that it is meant that a majority of the stored platelets will circulate normally after infusion into a recipient.Several studies indicate that platelet viability is correlated to maintenance of normal platelet morphology.See Murphy et al, Improved Storage of Platelets forTransfusion in a New Container , Blood 60 1 194 200 1982 Kuniki et al, A Study of Variables Affecting the Quality of Platelets Stored art Room Temperature ,Transfusion, 15 5 414 421 1975 and Holme et al, Platelet Storage at 220C. Effect of Type of Agitation on Morphology, Viability, and Function in Vitro , Blood 52 2 425 435, 1978 . As their name implies, platelets circulate as thin, compact disks with few processes. In most situations, loss of viability correlates with sphering, swelling and pseudopod formation. In the subsequently described experiments, platelet morphology has been used as an index of viability. This has been accomplished through the use of conventional phase microscopy. Additionally, the extent of platelet shape change in response to thrombin and the dispersion of size distribution by Coulter counter have been objectively measured. As reported in the above mentioned Murphy et al and Holme et al papers, it has been shown that these measures correlate with microscopic morphology and in vivo viability. In order to maintain viability, the cell must generate new adenosine triphosphate ATP continuously to meet its energy needs. Two pathways are normally availableglycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. In glycolysis, one molecule of glycose is converted to two molecules of lactic acid to generate generation two molecules of ATP. In oxidation, glucose, fatty acid, or amino acid enters the citric acid cycle and is converted to carbon dioxide cho and water. This pathway requires the presence of an adequate supply of oxygen. It is a much more efficient system than glycolysis. For example, oxidative metabolism of glucose to CO2 and water yields 36 molecules of ATP. It has been recognized that blood platelets will meet their energy needs in a manner which is not necessarily consistent with their long term storage in a viable condition. When given adequate oxygen, platelets produce most of their ATP through oxidation, but continue to produce lactic acid instead of diverting all metabolized glucose through the oxidative pathway. During the storage of platelets in plasma, lactic acid concentrations rise at approximately 2.5 millimolar per day. See Murphy et al, Platelet Storage at 220C. Role of Gas Transport AcrossPlastic Containers in Maintenance of Viability , Blood 46 2 209 218 1975 . This leads to gradual fall in pH.As explained the aforementioned Murphy et al article, when lactic acid concentration rises above 20 millimolar, a pH which started at 7.2 may reach 6.0. Since platelet viability is irreversibly lost if pH fails to 6.1 or below, a major limiting variable for platelet storage is pH. See Murphy et al, Storage of Platelet Concentrates at 220C. , Blood 35 4 549 557 1970 . At this rate of lactic acid production, pH would fall much more rapidly if it were not for naturally occurring plasma buffers, principally sodium bicarbonate. The present invention provides a method for processing and storing human blood platelets. This method includes the steps of providing a platelet concentrate comprising blood platelets in blood plasma including any anti coagulant added at a time of initial blood withdrawal extracting supernatant plasma from said concentrate to leave about 1 to 15 preferably 4 to 15 milliliters of plasma per unit of blood platelets to produce a platelet button and residual associated plasma adding a buffered Ringers citrate solution to said platelet button and associated residual plasma agitating said solution to resuspend said platelets to provide a synthetic suspension of platelets and storing said synthetic suspension in an oxygen permeable container at a temperature from about 18 30 C., preferably from about 200 24PC. until needed for use. The aforementioned buffered Ringers citrate solution comprises from about 120 300, preferably from about 170 180 preferably about 175 mEq L sodium between about 0 10, preferably from about 2 5 and even more preferably about 3 mEq L potassium between about 0 10, preferably from about 2 5 and even more preferably about 3.4 mEq L of calcium from about 80 180, preferably about 110 125 and even more preferably about 117 mEq L chloride from about 10 35, preferably from about 15 25 and even more preferably about 21 mEq L citrate and a buffer which is effective to maintain the pH of a unit of platelets and not more than 15 mls of said associated plasma at a pH in excess of 6.2 during seven days of storage with 60 ml unit of said medium in an oxygen permeable container maintained at the specified temperature such as the most preferred temperature 220C. The preferred blood platelet storage medium thus contains sodium, potassium, calcium and chloride at physiologic levels, in addition to a concentration of citrate which is included to bind calcium which might otherwise initiate coagulation. It is not believed that this basic blood platelet storage medium provides an exogenous substrate for metabolism since it has been reported that citrate cannot enter the citric acid cycle of platelets. See Tegos et al, PlateletGlycolysis in Platelet Storage. III.The Instability ofPlatelets to Utilize Exogenous Citrate , Transfusion 19 5 601 603 1979 . Glucose has not been incorporated into the present medium since its incorporation would result in the obligatory production of lactic acid, leading to an unacceptable lowering of pH and a loss of platelet viability. The preferred methods of the present inventmlÏ are designed to limit the amount of glucose which is available to stored platelets, and which therefore may act as a substrate for lactic acid production. The amount of glucose containing supernatant plasma removed from the platelet concentrate, and of glucose free storage medium added to the blood platelets and residual associated plasma ensure that the concentration of glucose in the resulting synthetic suspension is less than about 10 mM L at the onset of storage. Preferably, the extraction and storage medium addition procedures are performed such that the concentration of glucose in the resulting suspension is about 5 mM L at the onset of storage.As explained hereinafter, this concentration of glucose permits glycolysis to proceed until about a 1.5 mM concentration has been obtained, which occurs after about three days storage using the preferred methods and medium of the present invention. In order to maintain the pH of the resultant synthetic suspension of platelets at an acceptable level, the aforementioned medium has also been formulated such that pH at the onset of storage is in excess of 7.0, preferably between about 7.2 7.4. As mentioned above, the Ringers citrate solution maintains the pH of the suspension above 6.2 after 7 days of storage. This is preferably accomplished using a phosphate buffer, preferably sodium phosphate, which in solution has an HPO4 concentration of between about 0 100 mEq L and preferably 8 mEq L. As demonstrated hereinafter, this buffering is sufficient to accommodate the lactic acid derived from metabolism of platelet glycogen as well as the residual plasma glucose not removed during concentrate preparation. It is presently preferred to provide an additional platelet permeable, non glycolytic substrate for oxidative phosphorylation to the synthetic platelet suspension prior to storage. Glutamine is the preferred non glycolytic substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. In a preferred embodiment, glutamine may be incorporated as a component in the platelet storage medium in a concentration of between 5 to 25 preferably about 20 mM L. Alternatively, other non glycolytic substrates for oxidative phosphorylation may be selected from the group consisting of oxaloacetate, malate, jumarate, succinate, alpha ketogluterate, oxalosuccinate, isocitrate, cis aconitate, glutamine, amino acid precursors of citric acid cycle intermediates, amino and or fatty acids precursors of acetyl CoA, and mixtures thereof.Such amino acid precursors of citric acid cycle intermediates include those selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and mixtures thereof. Such precursors of acetyl CoA may be selected from the group consisting of leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, acetoacetic acid, acetone, fatty acids metabolized by beta oxidation and mixtures thereof. It is also presently preferred to add magnesium to the subject storage medium since this element is important to proper cell function. When used, magnesium should be present between 0 3, preferably about 2.0 mEq L. The present invention may be understood further from the following examples Platelet rich plasma PRP and platelet concentrates PC were prepared from whole blood donations anti coagulated with citrate phosphate dextrose CPD or acid citrate dextrose, as described in Blood 52 2 425 435, except that the supernatant plasma was extracted from the bag containing the platelet button as completely as possible using a Fenwal plasma extractor FenwalLaboratories, Deerfield, Ill. . The residual amount of plasma ranged from 4 to 15 ml. 45 ml of Ringers solution Travenol Laboratories, Inc., Deerfield, Ill. and 15 ml of 2.58 citrate solution were added to the bag containing the platelet button. The bag was left undistrubed for 45 minutes before being placed on a platelet agitator Helmer Labs., St. Paul, Minn. for resuspension.It is preferred to perform such an incubation step for at least 30 minutes prior to agitating of the solution to resuspend the platelets. After two hours of agitation, the platelets were completely resuspended. The PC was then transferred to a PL 732 container Fenwal, Inc. . This container is known to provide adequately oxygen supply. See Blood, 60 1 194 200 1982 . Various supplements to be tested were then added to the container which was stored on the platelet agitator at 22 C. The final media were tested concentrations indicated refer to final concentrations 1.

The oxygen consumption 9 rate, C O2 , nmoles min lO plts was determined by a steady state technique C O2 K02 148 pO2 platelet content x 10 9 KO2 is the capacity of the container for 2 transport nmoles min atm . The equation above states that the oxygen consumption of the platelets inside the container is equal to the flux of oxygen through the walls of the container. Lactate and glucose concentrations were determined as previously described. See Blood 46 2 209 218 1975 . Extent of platelet shape change with doxmbin 1U per ml final conc. was measured using aPayton aggregometer. It was quantitated by the ratio of extinction E12001 E1200, where E1200 represents the extinction of the platelets before addition of thrombin and E12001 of the extinction after. See Holme et al,Journal of Lab. and Clin. Medicine, 97 5 610 622 1981 . 3 ml. Samples of PC to be studied were taken at day 1, 3, 5 and 7. The final volumes of PC at day 7 ranged from 51 58 ml. A decrease in pH levels below 6.2 was observed when platelets were stored in the basic Ringers citrate medium, Ri Ci. Addition of sodium phosphate, Ri Ci Pho, prevented most of this fall in pH. Addition of glutamine,Ri, Ci Pho Glut, did not alter the serial pH measurements observed with Ri Ci Pho. However, the buffering capacity of the phosphate was not sufficient to maintain pH if glucose was added in the medium, Ri Ci Pho Gluc. The presence of glucose caused additional lactic acid accumulation overcoming the buffering capacity of Ri Ci Pho.These pH results are set forth in Table I TABLE I, pH Days of Storage 0 1 3 5 7 1.

Table III shows glucose concentrations under these storage conditions. It is apparent that glucose consumption and lactate production continue as long as glucose is present at the concentration above 1.5 mM.Such lactate production exceeds buffering capacity. InRi Ci Pho Glut, lactate production ceases on day 3 because substrate has been exhausted. These results also substantiate the fact that, if glucose is present, the rates of lactate production in artificial media and in plasma are similar. TABLE III, GLUCOSE mM Days of Storage 0 1 3 5 7 1.

However, this decrease was not related to the absence of glucose or plasma in the medium since it also took place with platelets stored in plasma. The results in Ri Ci Pho Glut firmly establish that oxygen consumption constinues from day 3 to day 7 when glucose is not being consumed. 9 v TABLE IV C O2 umoles min lO plts Days of Storage 1 3 5 7 1.

Some platelet clumping was apparent at day 5. This was reflected in a 10 decrease in platelet count at that time Table V . This phenomenon progressed as storage continued beyond 5 days. A 10 fall in platelet count was also observed when platelets were stored in plasma. TABLE V, PLATELET COUNT of Day 1 Value Coulter Counter Days of Storage 1 3 5 7 1. Ri Ci 4 100 95 5 89 3 85 14 2.

SeeBlood 60 1 194 200 and Blood 52 2 425 435.In the present experiments the dispersion measurements were below 2.0 and the extent of shape change measurements were close to 1.10 at days 3 and 5 when the platelets were stored in Ringers citrate medium with phosphate and glut amine. Certain of the above identified experiments were repeated using a different batch of platelet buttons.The residual amounts of plasma in this group again ranged from 4 to 15 mls. During these tests it appeared that an error may have been made in calculating the concentration of phosphate used in the previous tests. A reported above, it is now believed that the above described tests were conducted using 8 mEq L of phosphate not the 50 mEq L previously reported in the parent application . The following tests were conducted as described above, except that each sample was observed either on the seventh or eight day. As seen from the following dt 9 these studies confirm the previous results. It should be noted that during this particular series of tests, the pH using a Ringers citrate medium was not observed to fall below 6.2, but rather to about 6.5, and then to rise in subsequent observations. Nonetheless, these studies confirm the desirability of using an addition of phosphate to the Ringers citrate solution to maintain the pH of the medium substantially above those values, and further confirm that the additions of glucose, with or without phosphate, fall to unacceptably low pH values.

These findings are consistent with in vivo viability and clinical efficacy as predicted through maintained morphology, see Blood 60 1 194 200 Transfusion 15 5 414 421 and Blood 52 2 425 435. The necessity of adding a buffer to the Ringers citrate medium to prevent fall in pH has been clearly demonstrated.Even in accordance with the methods of the present invention, there is always residual plasma in the concentrate. There is not sufficient buffering capacity in this residual plasma to prevent pH fall when the glucose in that plasma is converted to lactic acid, and the added citrate does not sufficiently add to the buffering capacity of the medium. Similarly, a phosphate addition is not sufficient to maintain pH if significant additions of glucose are made to the storage medium, since such additions will result in additional lactic acid production. Glucose has therefore not been chosen as the primary substrate for platelet metabolism. Instead, the metabolic needs of each cells have been met by endogenous or exogenous amino acids or fatty acids which serve as a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that human blood platelets may be maintained in the absence of sugar, just as Wice et al and others have shown that certain tissue culture cells, such as HeLa cell can be grown with glutamine as a major energy source. See Wice et al, The Continuous Growth of Vetebrate Cells in the Absence of Sugar , Journal of Biological Chemistry, 256 15 7812 7819 1981 and Reitzer et al, Evidence that Glutamine, Not Sugar, is the Major Energy Source for Cultured HeLa Cells , Journal of Biological Chemistry, 254 8 2669 2676 1979 . As demonstrated above, platelets appear to be capable of sustaining oxidative metabolism even in the absence of sugar. After all glucose had been metabolized during the first three days of storage, platelets maintained morphology and continued oxygen consumption for an additional four days when glutamine was present to enter the citric acid cycle. It is also surprising that morphology and oxygen consumption were maintained to a considerable degree when glutamine was omitted from theRingers citrate phosphate medium. If the literature reports suggesting that citrate cannot be used as an exogenous substrate are accepted, it would appear that endongenous substrates were being used by the platelets during storage. From the above it will be seen that several novel synthetic human blood platelet storage media may be used in a novel method for processing and storing human blood platelets in oxygen permeable containers at about 220C. Use of these materials and methods should result in a substantial savings of natural plasma which is currently dedicated to the preservation of platelets during storage. It is further anticipated that the use of the herein described materials and methods will substantially reduce the likelihood that disease will be successfully transmitted through platelet transfusions.
