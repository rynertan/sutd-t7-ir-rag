# Hand held power tools including bearing supports for components undergoing linear movement.

## Abstract
A hand held power tool, for example a rotary percussive drill, includes a component for undergoing linear movement and a bearing support 1 for the component. The bearing support 1 comprises a cylinder formed from sheet metal strip with the longitudinal edges spaced to form a gap 6 in the wall of the cylinder. By making the bearing support from a sheet metal strip and providing a gap in the cylinder wall considerable cost savings are achieved.
