# Complementary logic integrated circuit.

## Abstract
A complementary logic integrated circuit which has large power handling capacity, high switching speed and still has low power consumption is disclosed. The circuit includes a first stage comprising complementary MIS FETs Q₃, Q₄ and an output stage comprising complementary vertical FETs Q₅, Q₆ . The gate of each V FET has a part which serves as the drain or source of a respective MIS FET, thus reducing the steps of fabrication and increasing the packing density. By varying the connection of positive and negative voltage source V , V , the circuit can be operated as inverting or non inverting logic circuit.
