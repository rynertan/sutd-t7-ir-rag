## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an automotive air duct structure and more specifically to an improvement on the automotive air duct structure connected to an air cleaner mounted in the engine room. Generally, as shown in Figure 1, an air cleaner 1 is mounted close to the engine 3 in the central upper portion of the engine room 2 and is connected to an air duct 4 for introducing outer air. The air duct is usually formed of synthetic resin into a certain shape, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, and is led toward the side of the car body with its front end inserted, through a grommet 7, into an opening 6 formed in the hood ledge 5. An intermediate portion of the air duct 4 is secured to the central upper portion of radiator core support 8 by fastenings 9 such as screws.With this arrangement, a duct portion 4a, i.e., the portion of the air duct extending from the fastening 9 secured to the radiator core support 8 to the front end of the air duct 4, lies immediately behind the head lamp unit 10 which is provided on the left and right hand side on the front of the car body, and there is no sufficient room for replacing the head lamp unit bulb. Obviously, when replacing a bulb 11 of the head lamp unit 10, the duct portion 4a of the air duct 4 must be displaced out of the way because it would otherwise hinder the replacement work of the bulb 11. The duct portion of the air duct, however, is held immovable with its front end inserted into the opening 6 of the hood ledge 5 and with the intermediate portion fastened to the radiator core support 8, and it is therefore not easy to remove it to clear the way for the bulb 11.That is, before replacing the bulb 11 the fastening must first be loosened and removed by using some tool and the air duct 4 pulled toward the center of the engine room to withdraw its front end from the opening 6 of the hood ledge 5. Then the duct portion is bent to provide a sufficient space behind the head lamp unit 10 to allow replacement of the bulb 11. In this way, the conventional air duct structure requires a troublesome work for removal of the duct portion before one can replace the head lamp unit bulb.In Figures 1 and 2, indicated at 20 and 21 are a front fender and a head lamp unit mounting bracket, respectively.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide an automotive air duct structure in which a duct portion of air duct which lies behind the head lamp unit can readily be moved out of position to clear the way for the head lamp unit without having to remove fastenings on the air duct by using tool, thereby allowing an quick and easy replacement of the head lamp unit bulb. To achieve this objective, an air duct structure of the present invention comprises an extensible, contractible and bendable member provided to at least a part of the duct portion which lies behind the head lamp unit and extends from the intermediate portion of the air duct fastened to the car body and to the front end of the air duct.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a plan view of an automotive engine room showing the arrangement of the air duct Figure 2 is a perspective view, partially cut away, showing one example of conventional automotive air duct structure Figure 3 is a perspective view, partially cut away, showing one example embodiment of an automotive air duct structure of this invention and Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of the air duct structure of this invention taken along the line IV IV ofFigure 1.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring to Figure 3 showing one embodiment of this invention, an air duct 4, as with the conventional one, has its end inserted, through a grommet 7, into an opening 6 formed in the hood ledge 5 and also has its intermediate portion secured by a fastening 9 such as screw to the central upper portion of a radiator core support 8. A major difference of the air duct of this invention from the conventional one is that an extensible, contractible and bendable bellows 12 is provided to a duct portion 4a which extends from the fastening 9 secured to the car body to the front end. In this embodiment, the air duct 4 consists of an air duct body 13 connected to the air cleaner 1 and a front duct part 14 which is provided separate from the air duct body 13 and securely inserted into the opening 6 of the hood ledge 5. Securely connected by clamp rings 15, 15 between the air duct body 13 and the front duct part 14 is the flexible bellows 12 lying behind the head lamp unit 10. As shown in Figure 4, a cross section taken along the line IV IV of Figure 1, a portion of the air duct 4 disposed above a radiator cooling fan 17 mounted behind the radiator 16, which is installed at the front of the car body, is formed integral with a horizontally extending protective flange 18 to prevent worker s fingers 19 from touching the cooling fan 17 while servicing the engine room 2. In Figure 4, denoted 22 is a front cross member and 23 an apron. When, with the air duct structure of this embodiment, a bulb 11 of the head lamp unit 10 is to be replaced, the duct portion 4a behind the head lamp unit 10 is moved out of position indicated by the solid line of Figure 3 into the upright position shown by the two dot line. That is, the bellows 12 on the duct portion 4a is contracted to pull out the front end of the air duct from the opening 6 of the hood ledge 5, after which the duct portion 4a is bent upright at the bellows 12 to provide a sufficient space behind the head lamp unit 10 for replacing the bulb 11. After the replacement of the bulb is completed, the duct portion 4a is restored to the original position behind the head lamp unit 10 as indicated by the solid line ofFigure 3. Although in the above embodiment the bellows 12 is provided behind the head lamp unit 10, the position of the bellows may be other than this as long as it allows flexible movement of the duct portion 4a from behind the head lamp unit to ensure easy replacement of the bulb 11. In addition, while the bellows 12 is formed separated from the air duct 4, it is possible to form the bellows integral with the air duct 4.Further, while in the above embodiment the front end of the air duct 4 is inserted into the opening 6 cut in the hood ledge 5, it is possible to form an opening at the side of the radiator core support 8 and insert the air duct front end into that opening for introducing air. Furthermore, although the above embodiment has been described in the case of the air duct 4 which is formed of rigid synthetic resin, it goes without saying that the present invention is also applicable to those air ducts which have bellows between the air cleaner 1 and the intermediate portion of duct secured to the car body. It should also be noted that this invention can be applied to air ducts for the fuel injection controllers in addition to those for the air cleaners. Last but not least, it should also be noted that the bellows may be replaced by some other flexible members. As can be seen from the foregoing, since the automotive air duct structure of this invention employs flexible bellows in at least a part of the duct portion of air duct which ranges from the intermediate portion of the air duct fastened to the car body to the front end of air duct and which lies behind the head lamp unit, the duct portion of the air duct can easily be displaced from behind the head lamp unit because of the flexibility of the bellows without having to use tools which are required with the conventional air duct structure. This in turn allows the replacement of the head lamp unit bulb to be performed very easily.
