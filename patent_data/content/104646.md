## Description
Method of Preparing L Gulono f lactone This invention relates to a method of preparing L gulono r lactone which is a very useful compound employed in a broad range as starting materials of, among others, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. More specifically, this invention relates to an industrially advantageous method of preparing L gulono 1 lactone with a good yield and a high selectivity coefficient by subjecting L ascorbic acid to catalytic reduction in a solvent under elevated pressure in the presence of ruthenium catalyst.As advantageous reduction of L ascorbic acid, there has been known a method of subjecting it to catalytic reduction using as the catalyst a 10 palladium carbon, more concretely, conducting the reduction under hydrogen pressure of 50 Psi pound square inch at 500C for 24 hours using the abovementioned catalyst in an amount corresponding to 10 w w weight per weight relative to the L ascorbic acid to be reduced The Journal of Organic Chemistry 1981 , 46, pp. 2976 29771. However, repeated follow ups of the above known method by the present inventors confirmed that the conversion is low, the yield does not exceed 65 70 and reproduction of quantitative yield is hardly expected because of relatively large amount of by products. This is surmised to be due to the following As have been well known, catalytic reduction of a compound having enol lactone ring is accompanied by hydrogenolysis to form desoxy acid, and hydrogenation of enol and rupture of lactone ring are competitive reactions, and thus the method using the above mentioned palladium type catalyst cannot necessarily be regarded as giving a satisfactory yield percentage of the desired L gulono r lactoner i.e.a satisfactory selectivity coefficient of saturated lactone, and besides, the amount of by products formed by rupture of the lactone ring is relatively large. The present inventors conducted diligent research work on finding out a catalyst by which reduction of L ascorbic acid can be conducted with an industrial advantage. As a result, it was unexpectedly found that the catalytic reduction of L ascorbic acid under elevated pressure in a solvent in the presence of a ruthenium catalyst renders the reaction to proceed in a short period of time at a low temperature in the presence of a very small amount of the catalyst to give L gulono iactone of a high purity in a good yield, even in its industrial scale production e.g. in terms of Kge level. Based on this finding, the present invention was accomplished. This invention thus relates to a method of preparing Li gulono 1 lactone, which is characterized by subjectingL ascorbic acid to catalytic reduction under elevated pressure in a solvent in the presence of ruthenium catalyst. As the ruthenium catalyst employable in the method of this invention, there may be mentioned ruthenium itself, or ruthenium oxide such as ruthenium dioxide, ruthenium tetroxide, or ruthenium or ruthenium oxide as adsorbed by a known method on an adsorbing agent e.g. diatomaceous earth, silica or activated charcoal, especially 1 10 w w , preferably 2 5 w w ruthenium activated charcoal. The used amount of the catalyst is in the range of 2 10 w w , especially preferably 3 5 w w relative to L ascorbic acid. The ruthenium catalyst can be repeatedly used without further re activation. As the solvent, there may be exemplified water, alcohols such as ethyl alcohol or methyl alcohol or a mixture thereof, and, among them, water is most preferable in view of high solubility of the starting material in water. The volume of solvent used is not limited so long as the reaction proceeds, but, in general, it ranges from 3 m to 30 ml, preferably 5 10 m , relative to 1 g of L ascorbic acid. The initial pressure i.e., the pressure when the reduction starts is usually 5 300 Kg cm2, preferably 10 100 Kg cm2. The pressure is applied usually with hydrogen gas, or with a mixture of an inert gas such as helium, argon carbon dioxide or nitrogen with hydrogen.The reaction temperature ranges from OOC to 600C, preferably 10 45 C. More specifically, the reduction is conducted under 30 Kg cm2 100 Kg cm2 and at a temperature of 15 400C to give a preferable result.The reaction time varies, among others, with kinds and amounts of the catalysts used, the reaction pressure and temperature employed, types of the autoclave or rotation velocity of the stirrer, and the reaction usually completes within 7 hours. For example, stirring is conducted preferably for about 30 minutes to 5 6 hours at 60 150 r.p.m. rotation per minute . The volume of hydrogen supplied to the reduction reaction is at least 1 mole preferably 1 to 2 moles relative to 1 mole of L ascorbic acid. Other reaction conditions are analogous to those employed in common reduction processes in a liquid phase under high pressure.Thus prepared endproduct can be separated by conventional means, for example, taking the reaction mixture out of the autoclave, separating the catalyst from the reaction mixture by filtration and evaporating off the solvent from the filtrate under reduced pressure. Further, upon necessity, thus separated end product is suspended in an alcohol e.g. methanol or ethanol or an aqueous alcohol and the suspension is warmed, followed by cooling to cause crystallization to yield highly pure crystals of L gulono X lactone. As explained in the foregoing, according to the method of this invention of preparing L gulono t lactone by reducingL ascorbic acid in the presence of a ruthenium catalyst, a relatively small amount of the catalyst is sufficient, a high conversion rate can be reached at a low temperature for a very short period of time in other words, absorption rate of H2 is high , and a highly pure end product can be prepared with a high yield by a simple after treatment, thus the method of this invention for preparing L gulono lactone is very advantageous as an industrial scale production, i.e. in terms of Kg. level. Fig. 1 shows that, in the cases 1 Example 1 and 2 Example 2 of this invention employing Ru C at 24 320C and 400C respectively, absorption rates of H2 are remarkably higher conversion rate is higher than those in cases 3 Reference Example 1 and 4 Reference Exmaple 2 of a known method employing Pd C at 500C. In Fig. 2,5,6,7 and 8 respectively show the absorption rates of H2 in Examples 5 and 6, andReference Examples 3 and 4. It is clear that the conversion rates of 5 and 6 in this invention are higher than those of 7 and 8 in the known method. Thus prepared L gulono 1 lactone has a wide range of uses as intermediates or materials for chemical synthesis and can be used as starting materials for medicines, agricultural chemicals, etc. For instance, L gulono t lactone is allowed to react with P phenetidine or P anisidine to give N P ethoxyphenyl L gulonic amide or N P methoxyphenyl L gulonic amide, which are antipyretic and analgesic agents c.f.
