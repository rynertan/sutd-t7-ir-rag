## Description
SPECIFICATIONDISPLAY UNIT FOR SPECIFIED ADDRESSOF NC COMMAND PROGRAM TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a display unit for a specified address of an NC Numerical Control command program and, more particularly, to a technique for selectively displaying only a specified address referred to from a keyboard at the time of displaying, on a fixed display, anNC command program stored in a bubble memory or the like ofNC equipment. BACKGROUND ART In the case of checking an NC command program, the situation occasionally arises where it is desired to verify what command has been issued to a specific address alone. It would be useful for the organization of tools, for example, if it were preknown what T code has been commanded, and it would be helpful to set the amount of compensation of each tool if it were preknown what H code has been commanded. In such a case, according to the prior art, there is no means but to visually look up a desired address in the entire NC command program after printing out all the contents of the program or while turning over displayed pictures of the NC command program provided on a display. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been made in view of the above, and has for its object to provide a display unit for a specified address of an NC command program which is designed to selectively display only a specified address of the NC command program on a display. Fig. 1 is a diagram explanatory of the arrangement of the present invention. An NC command program is stored in an NC command program memory means MEM, and when supplied with input from selective display command input means IN1, specified address part select means SEL selects, from the stored NC command program, an address specified by specified address input means IN2 and characters of the specified address and an address immediately following it. Then, the selected contents are output to and displayed on a display DPY. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a diagram explanatory of the arrangement of the present invention Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating, by way of example, the principal part of the hardware structure of a device embodying the present invention andFigs. 3 and 4 are flowcharts illustrating examples of the software structure of the device embodying the present invention. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the principal part of an example of the hardware structure of a device embodying the present invention. Reference numeral 1 indicates a microcomputer, 2 its bus, 3 a ROM having stored therein programs necessary for causing the microcomputer 1 to perform its predetermined operations, 4 a RAM having a temporary input buffer area 4a, a running information buffer area 4b, etc., 5 an address decoder, 6 a tape reader, 7 a command tape, 8 an external memory such as a magnetic bubble memory or the like, 9 a keyboard having a selective display command key 9a and pluralities of other plural command keys 9b and character input keys 9c, 10 a pulse generator, 11 a CRT controller, 12 an address switching circuit, 13 an address decoder, 14 video RAM, 15 a data driver, 16 a character generator ROM, 17 a display section, 18 an axis control circuit, 19 a servo amplifier and 20 a motor. TheNC command program, when provided in the form of the command tape 7, is read into the microcomputer 1 by means of the tape reader 6, and when stored in the external memory 8, it is read out directly from the memory. For convenience of description, let it be assumed that the NC command program is stored in the external memory 8. In ordinary numerical control, the microcomputer 1 reads out the NC command program from the external memory 8 block by block and interprets it, and the axis control circuit 18 is controlled by running information prepared on the basis of the result of interpretation by the microcomputer, thereby controlling the rotation of the motor 20 via the servo amplifier 19. Fig. 3 is a flowchart illustrating an example of the software structure of the device embodying the present invention. A description will hereinafter be given, with reference to Fig. 3, of the specified address displaying function of this device. At first, when an alphabetic character indicating an address desired to selectively display is entered through using the character input key 9c on the keyboard 9, the microcomputer 1 reads out its input key code S1 and decides whether it is a character code or not S2 . In this case, since it is a character code, the microcomputer 1 loads the entered character into the temporary input buffer area 4a of the RAM 4 53 and, at the same time, writes the entered character via the data driver 15 into the video RAM 14 at a predetermined position, for example, at a position corresponding to the lower end of the display screen 84 . Incidentally, the contents of the video RAM 14 are being cyclically provided by a scanning address of the CRT controller 11 to the display section 17 via the character generator ROM 16, and consequently, the content of the temporary input buffer area 4a is displayed on the display screen of the display section 17. This is intended to facilitate verification of the content of the input. Next, when the selective display command key 9a of the keyboard 9 is depressed, the microcomputer 1 inputs its key code S1 and then performs the discriminations in steps S2 and S5, identifying that the depressed key is the selective display command key 9a. Incidentally, when the command key of other kins is depressed, processing corresponding to the depressed key is performed S6 . When it is identified in step S5 that the input key is the selective display command key, it is checked whether the content of the temporary input buffer area 4a is one character or not and whether it is an address character or not S7, S8 . When it is neither one character nor an address character, an error display is provided S9 . This takes into account the fact that an address in the NC command program is usually indicated by one alphabetic character and all the alphabetic characters cannot be used as addresses. Then, when it is decided in step S8 that the content of the temporary input buffer area is an address character, processing for selective display of the specified address is performed S10 , after which the content of the temporary input buffer area 4a and the display are cleared S11 . Fig. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example of software which implements the selective display processing function. Upon starting the selective display processing, the microcomputer 1 clears a display flag set in the RAM 4 to a O and, at the same time, sets a pointer indicating the display position, similarly set in the RAM 4, to a value corresponding to the left upper corner of the display screen, for example S20 . Then, one character, for example, at the head of the NC command program stored in the external memory 8 is read S21 , and it is decided whether the character is an address character or not and whether it is an address to be displayed or not tis22, S23 .In the event that the thus read character is an address character and an address to be displayed, that is, when it coincides with the address stored in the temporary input buffer area 4a, the display flag is set to a 1 S24 , and the input character is written into the video RAM 14 at an area indicated by the pointer S25 , after which the value of the pointer is incremented by 1 S26 . If the read character is not the address character, the operation proceeds to step S25 only when the display flag is a 1 S27 , and if the read character is not the address to be displayed, the display flag is cleared to a O S28 . The search for the content to be displayed is continued until the value of the pointer reaches a display screen end value, or until the NC command program comes to an end S29, S30 . Assuming that an NC command program such, for example, as N1G91GOOX123Y456T01 N2G43Z78H01 N3G01Z91F23 N4GOOZ 91T02 N5G01Z91 N6GOOZ091T03 N7G01Z91 N8GOOZ 91T01 is stored in the external memory 8 and that the selective display command key 9a is depressed after input of T , then T01 T02 T03 TO1 are displayed on the display screen of the display section 17 thus, it is clear at a glance what tools are to be used. As has been described in the foregoing, according to the present invention, since only a specified address part of an NC command program is displayed on a display only by specifying an address desired to selectively display and entering a selective display command, the invention possesses the advantage of allowing much ease in verification of a desired address part. Further, since only the specified address part is displayed, evne if the space for display is small, a number of desired addresses can be displayed.
