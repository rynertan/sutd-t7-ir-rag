## Description
TEXTILE WARP SIZE The present invention is directed to a process for the warp sizing of textile yarns and to the improved weaving properties of the yarns thus obtained. In addition, the invention relates to a process for warp sizing utilizing a warp size composition characterized by its improved compatability with textile sizing lubricants which moreover facilitates improved lubricant removability during desizing. As used herein warp is an inclusive term which refers to the lengthwise running yarns in a woven fabric. A warp sizing material is any substance which is applied to the warp yarns for the basic purpose of strengthening and protecting the yarns from abrasion, usually as a result of its adhesive, film forming action. Warp sizes provide stiffness and smoothness to fibers which facilitate decreased incidents of entanglement and breakage during the weaving operation while also providing abrasion resistance to the fibers to avoid breakage and injury during handling. The warp sizing, or slashing as it is often called, of textile yarns consists in the impregnation of these yarns with a sizing solution or dispersion. This is followed by removal of the excess sizing by passage of the wet yarns through a set of squeeze rolls followed by drying. Warp sizing is carried out on a slashing machine consisting of a creel which generally holds one or more section beams. These section beams usually contain from 200 500 yarn ends. The yarn ends from several of these section beams are brought together so as to form a sheet of yarn with about 1500 8000 ends. This sheet then enters the size box wherein it is guided through the sizing solution and through one or more sets of squeeze rolls, so as to remove the surplus size which then falls back into the size box. Drying is accomplished by passing the yarn through a heated chamber or over the surface of internally heated drying cylinders. The dried yarn is then separated by means of horizontal split rods into sections corresponding to those of the original section beams.The yarn is then almost immediately recombined by being passed through a vertical comb and thereupon onto a take up beam referred to as a loom beam. This loom beam holds the yarn until such time as it is used in the weaving process. One of the primary functions of the disclosed sizing process is to aid in the reduction of loom abrasion. To do this, the sizing must exert a film forming action, with the resultant film having the ability to resist the abrasive action of the various machine parts that come in contact with the yarns as well as the rubbing together of the individual yarns themselves. Typical film forming substances used as warp size materials have included starches, dextrins, glues, flours, gums, gelatin, cellulosics e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose , polyvinyl alcohol, and polyacrylic acid. Many factors including the type and composition of fibers to be sized, construction, and count weight per unit length will determine which sizing materials or combination thereof should be employed. Aqueous dispersions of starch and starch derivatives have been employed in the warp sizing of many natural, synthetic, or blended fibers. See, for example, the warp sizes of U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,946,705 issued July 26, 1960 to H. Olsen employing starch amine derivatives 3,650,787 and 3,673,171 issued March 21, and June 27, 1972, respectively to L. Elizer employing amphoteric and oxyalkylated amphoteric starches and 4,421,566 issued December 20, 1983 to M. Hasuly et al. employing high amylose, cationic fluidity starch derivatives. Lubricants are also conventionally employed in warp size compositions to improve weaving performance. The lubricants aid in reducing yarn to yarn and loom to yarn friction. Additionally they are noted to provide lubrication to loom parts during the later steps of the weaving process. Sizing compositions which evenly disperse the lubricants are particularly preferred as uniform lubricant distribution will help provide optimum weaving performance. The ability to improve loom efficiency where 100 no loom stops by an amount of as little as 1 to 2 would be recognized in the field as a significant improvement. Many varieties of fats, oils, and waxes obtained from various animal, vegetable, mineral, or synthetic sources have been advantageously used for such lubrication in typical amounts ranging from 0.5 to 10 , based upon the weight of the film forming substance. Mill waxes which generally comprise tallow and hydrogenated tallow glycerides are typically employed as size lubricants. Although the presence of size is necessary to make a yarn weave satisfactorily, it is equally true that complete removal of the size is an essential prerequisite to successful finishing. Therefore, in most cases subsequent to weaving, the woven textile must be desized in order to avoid interference of the size with finishing processes such as, for example, bleaching, dyeing, printing, and water repellancy treatment. Depending on the size composition employed, desizing is accomplished by one or more steps including the following enzymatic or oxidative degradation, high temperature washing, steaming, caustic scouring, and solvent or surfactant treatment. Although the film forming portion of the size composition will normally be completely removed by the above methods, removability of the lubricant is significantly more difficult, often requiring expensive and time consuming removal techniques. It has been estimated that only approximately 25 30 of conventional size waxes on fabric are saponified or converted to water soluble materials which are then removable. The remainder is not totally soluble and thus ends up on the fabric in the form of resist spots which are especially noticable after dyeing as exhibited by uneven dye penetration. Therefore, while uniform distribution of lubricant will result in the best weaving performance, its removal is also important for the textile finisher who, even if unable to remove it all, can achieve a condition which may permit a more regular and even appearance after dyeing. Due to the current use of high speed air jet looms with fill yarn insertion rates of 400 650 per minute as compared to 170 240 per minute for conventional looms , greater amounts of lubricants are sometimes employed to combat increased yarn stress encountered during weaving.With these higher quantities, lubricant removal, always a major cause for concern, is now aggravated. There is therefore a need for a warp sizing composition capable of forming a uniform film upon warp yarns to sufficiently strengthen and protect them during conventional and high speed weaving, capable of uniformly dispersing the textile lubricant in quantities equal to or greater than the amounts conventionally used on the warp yarns, and capable of more complete lubricant removal after weaving, by the use of inexpensive, less time consuming removal methods. The present invention provides a warp size composition comprising 100 parts water 2 to 40 parts of a hydrophobic starch ether or ester derivative, wherein the ether or ester substituent comprises a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chain of at least 5 and preferably less than 22 carbon atoms and 3 to 50 , preferably 5 to 20 , of a lubricant, based on the weight of the starch derivative. In a preferred embodiment, starch succinates prepared by reacting a fluidity corn starch base with 1 10 octenyl succinic anhydride provide excellent weavability as well as uniform lubricant dispersion upon textile fibers. During desizing, the starch derivatives as well as the lubricant employed may be easily removed. Other film forming substances in addition to the starch derivative herein may be added to the warp size composition. In one embodiment, the warp size composition additionally comprises the synthetic resin polyvinyl alcohol, in equivalent amounts to the starch derivative. A procedure for sizing textile fibers with the warp size composition herein is also taught. The applicable starch bases which may be used in the preparation of the warp sizing derivatives herein include any amylaceous substance such as untreated starch, as well as starch derivatives including dextrinized, hydrolyzed, oxidized, esterified and etherified starches still retaining amylaceous material. The starches may be derived from any sources including, for example, corn, high amylose corn, wheat, potato, tapioca, waxy maize, sago or rice. Starch flours may also be used as a starch source. By the term hydrophobic starch is meant a starch ether or ester derivative wherein the ether or ester substituent comprises a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chain of at least 5 carbon atoms.It should be understood that the hydrocarbon chain may contain some branching. However, it is preferred, to employ those starch derivatives wherein the hydrocarbon chain is unbranched. It should also be understood that the ether or ester substituent may contain other groups in addition to the hydrocarbon chain as long as such groups do not interfere with the hydrophobic properties of the substituent. A suitable class of reagents for preparing the half acid starch esters useful herein include substituted cyclic dicarboxylic acid anhydrides such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,661,349 issued on December 1, 1953 to Caldwell et al., having the structureEMI6.1 radical and A comprises a hydrocarbon chain of at least 5, preferably 5 14, carbon atoms. The substituted cyclic dicarboxylic acid anhydrides falling within the above structural formula are the substituted succinic and glutaric acid anhydrides. In addition to the hydrocarbon chain substituent other substituent groups such as sulfonic acid or lower alkyl which would not affect sizing performance may be present. Another suitable class of reagents for preparing starch ester warp sizing derivatives useful herein include the imidazolides or N,N disubstituted imidazolium salts of carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as those described in U.S. Re. 28,809 issued May 11, 1976 to M. Tessler which is a reissue of U.S. Pat. No. 3,720,663 issued on March 13, 1973 to M. Tessler and U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,272 issued April 26, 1977 to M.EMI7.1 wherein Z isEMI7.2 A comprises a hydrocarbon chain of at least 5, preferably 5 to 14, carbon atoms, Rl is H or C1 C4 alkyl,R2 is C1 C4 alkyl, and X is an anion. A third class of reagents useful herein include the etherifying reagents described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,876,217 issued on March 3, 1959 to E. Paschall comprising the reaction product of an epihalohydrin with a tertiary amine having the structureEMI7.3 wherein R3 andR4 are independantly H or a C1 C4 alkyl and A2 comprises a hydrocarbon chain of at least 5, preferably 5 to 14, carbon atoms. The starch etherification or esterification reactions may be conducted by a number of techniques known in the art and discussed in the literature employing, for example, an aqueous reaction medium, an organic solvent medium, or a dry heat reaction technique. For a discussion of such techniques see R. L. Whistler, Methods in CarbohydrateChemistry, Vol. IV, 1964, pp. 279 311 R.L. Whistler et al., Starch Chemistry and Technology, Second Edition, 1984, pp. 311 366 and R.Davidson and N. Sittig, Water Soluble Resins, 2nd Ed., 1968, Chapter 2. The warp sizing starch derivatives herein are preferably prepared employing an aqueous reaction medium at temperatures between 200 and 450C. For use in the warp sizing process, the starch derivatives may be produced either in gelatinized or ungelatinized form. The advantage of having the derivative in ungelatinized form is that it may be filtered, washed, dried and conveyed to the mill in the form of a dry powder. When employing the cyclic dicarboxylic acid anhydride reagents, starch is preferably treated in granular form with the reagents in an aqueous alkali medium at a pH not lower than 7 nor higher than 11. This may be accomplished by suspending the starch in water, to which has been added either before or after the addition of the starch sufficient base such as alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth hydroxide, quaternary ammonium hydroxide, or the like, to maintain the mixture in an alkaline state during the reaction. The required amount of the reagent is then added, agitation being maintained until the desired reaction is complete. Heat may be applied, if desired, in order to speed the reaction however, if heat is used, temperatures of less than about 400C should be maintained.In a preferred method, the alkali and the anhydride reagent are added concurrently to the starch slurry, regulating the rate of flow of each of these materials so that the pH of the slurry remains preferably between 8 and 11. Due to the greater hydrophobic nature of certain of the substituted cyclic dicarboxylic acid anhydride reagents useful herein i.e., those having C10 or higher substituents , the reagents react with starch in only minor amounts in standard aqueous reactions. In order to improve the starch reaction efficiency, starch is reacted with the hydrophobic reagent under standard aqueous conditions in the presence of at least 5 , preferably 7 15 based on the weight of the reagent , of a watersoluble organic quaternary salt which is employed as a phase transfer agent. The organic salts, of which trioctylmethyl ammonium chloride and tricaprylmethyl ammonium chloride are preferably employed, are described in U.S. 3,992,432 issued November 16, 1976 to D. Napier et al. . The proportion of etherifying or esterifying reagent used will vary with the particular reagent chosen since they naturally vary in reactivity and reaction efficiency , and the degree of substitution desired. Thus, substantial improvements in warp sizing efficiency have been achieved by using a starch derivative made with 1 of the reagent, based on the weight of the starch. Preferred ranges are on the order of 1 to 5 . Warp sizing compositions must necessarily be resistant towards congealing in aqueous dispersion. This brings about improved workability of the sizing in the slasher, more uniform application and less gelling and lumping, thus leading to a reduction in the clogging of size lines and mechanical breakdowns. It has been observed that some of the etherifying and esterifying reagents useful herein which possess linear chain hydrocarbon substituents containing 12 or more carbon atoms render starches capable in aqueous dispersion of forming high viscosity complexes with amylose at temperatures above 70 C. Sizing compositions are typically applied at temperatures ranging between 750 and 98 C. In order to avoid application problems, it may therefore be necessary to maintain the warp sizing composition at a temperature above that which the starch derivative is known to complex. When employing waxy starch derivatives composed primarily of amylopectin , no complex formation is exhibited at high temperatures. It has been discovered that the viscosity increases due to complex formation can also be eliminated by employing derivatives of converted starch bases, prepared by conventional acid conversion, enzyme hydrolysis, or oxidation procedures, which have been sufficiently converted depending upon the starch base and the hydrophobic derivatization employed. For example, the tetradecenyl succinate of corn starch will form complexes at high temperatures however, an acid hydrolyzed corn starch base having a water fluidity WF of at least 40 which is treated with the same succinic anhydride reagent will not exhibit any detrimental effects due to complex formation and thus is useful at all typical application temperatures. In practice, it has been found that the hydrophobic starch derivatives can be most effectively used as warp sizing agents when dispersed in water in amounts ranging from 2 to 40 parts of the derivative per hundred parts of water. The precise amounts of the starch employed vary depending upon the weaving equipment, the fabric construction i.e., the style and the type of fiber being treated. The lubricants employed in the warp size composition may be selected from a wide variety of known synthetic and natural fats, oils, and waxes typically used to reduce friction during weaving. Preferred lubricants include vegetable and mineral oils and tallow. As with the starch derivatives, the amount of lubricant employed will vary depending mainly upon the weaving equipment and fiber to be lubricated. Typical amounts range between 0.5 to 15 , based on starch concentration. Larger amounts have not typically been employed due to the difficulties experienced when attempts are made to provide uniform lubricant distribution during sizing and acceptable lubricant removal during desizing.However, by employing the starch derivatives described herein, larger amounts of lubricant i.e. 20 to 50 may be employed due to the improved lubricant distribution and removability facilitated by the derivatives. In addition to the hydrophobic starch derivatives and lubricants employed in the present invention, other conventional warp size additives such as softeners, acrylic and polyester binders, anti static agents and mildew preventatives may also be used in conventional amountsSince many materials used as additives offer both a lubricating and a softening effect, lubricants are sometimes mistakenly referred to as softeners and vice versa. However, softeners i.e., glycerine and soaps are used to give a soft handle to the warp and the size film and to decrease the film brittleness through a plasticizing effect. Other film forming substances may also be employed in addition to the hydrophobic starch derivatives, if desired. Suitable substances for use herein would include, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, and polyacrylic acid. If employed, such film forming substances are preferably present in amounts less than or equal to that of the hydrophobic starch. The warp sizes produced herein are useful in the conventional sizing of any natural, synthetic or blended fiber as, for example, cotton, polyester, wool, nylons, rayons and glass fibers. In the examples which follow, all parts and percentages are given by weight and all temperatures are in degrees Fahrenheit Celsius . The wax removeability of the warp sizes herein was qualitatively evaluated employing the following test procedure Dye Receptivity Test An aqueous slurry comprising 8.8 of the starch derivative to be tested and 1.8 mill wax 20 wax based on starch is cooked in a boiling water bath for 30 minutes in order to form a uniform dispersion.The wax employed is North Wax 686 hydrogenated tallow obtained fromNorth Chemical Co. of Marietta, Ga. To obtain 10 by weight of the size on fabric, a 12 x 12 in. 0.305 x 0.305 m. piece of 65 35 polyester cotton fabric is saturated in the dispersion then run through a laboratory padder manufactured by L W Machine Works of Rock Hill, SouthCarolina for extraction at a pressure setting of 20. Thereafter, the fabric is dried in a forced draft oven at 2700F 1320C for three minutes. The fabric is desized by soaking the piece in an enzyme solution consisting of 2 parts enzyme Super Exsize TX 2H obtained from PremierMalt of Peoria, Illinois , 0.75 parts surfactant Triton X 100 obtained from Rohm and Haas of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , and 97.25 parts water at 1600F 710C for fifteen minutes. The fabric is then padder extracted, rinsed with water at 185 1900F 85 880C for ten minutes and washed with cold tap water for 3 minutes, then padder extracted again.Thereafter, the fabric is dried on a pin frame at 3000F 149 C for three minutes. The fabric is finally scorched with an AATCC ScorchTester obtained from Atlas Electric Devices Co. of Chicago, Illinois at 4250F 2180C for 1 minute in order to exaggerate the effects of fabric dye absorbancy caused by the presence of any residual wax. The dye solution employed is an aqueous solution comprising 0.3 acetic acid and 0.1 Sevron Brill Red 4G obtained from Plyam Chemical, of Queens Villaye, New York . The desized fabric is immersed in the dye solution which is maintained at 70 750F 21 240C for 5 seconds then rinsed under cold tap water for approximately 15 seconds. The uniformity of dye receptivity on fabric is a qualitative measure of wax removal. It is understood that the deeper and more uniform the dye penetration, the more complete the wax removal during desizing. EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates a laboratory procedure for preparing a converted half acid ester starch succinate derivative useful herein. About 100 parts corn starch are slurried in 150 parts water followed by 0.55 parts of reagent grade, concentrated hydrochloric acid.The temperature of the slurry is raised to 1250F 520C and the mixture is allowed to react with constant stirring for 16 hours. Thereafter, the pH of the hydrolyzed starch slurry is adjusted to 4.5 with sodium carbonate. After cooling the slurry to room temperature, the pH is adjusted to 7.5 by the addition of dilute sodium hydroxide 3 . A total of 1 part octenyl succinic acid anhydride OSA reagent is added slowly to the agitated starch slurry with the pH maintained at 7.5 by the metered addition of the dilute sodium hydroxide. After the reaction is complete, the pH is adjusted to about 5.5 with dilute hydrochloric acid 3 1 . The starch is thereafter recovered by filtration, washed three times with water and air dried. The product will have an approximate water fluidity WF of 40 and carboxyl content of about 0.8 . EXAMPLE 2 This example demonstrates the use of the product of the invention in an 11 can conventional pressure slasher on a polyester cotton blend.A starch succinate made as in Example 1 was used to size 26 1 yarns for a 65 35 polyester cotton poplin fabric of 96 x 60 construction. Size A was prepared consisting of 45.36 kg. 100 lb. of a starch succinate having a WF of 40 and made according to Example 1 with 1 OSA based on starch solids 6.35 kg. 14 lb. mill wax 45.36 kg. 100 lib. polyvinyl alcohol 36.29 kg. 80 lib. 25 aqueous polyester binder and 568 1. 150 gal. water. Application using a slasher at a pressure gauge reading of 1.1 kg. m.2 15 psi resulted in a size content of 15.0 . For comparative purposes, conventional Size B for this style consisting of 45.36 kg. 100 lb. fluidity corn starch WF 20 6.35 kg. 14 Lob. mill wax 45.36 kg. 100 lb. polyvinyl alcohol 36.29 80Ib. 25 aqueous polyester binder and 644 1. 170 gal. water, resulting in a size content of 14.1 was also tested. The warp yarns were woven on a conventional Draper X 3 loom at a rate of 178 yarn insertions per minute. Weaving efficiency with Size A was superior to comparative Size B as measured by loom efficiency 9798 as opposed to 95 96 . Use of Warp Size A also resulted in less shedding at the bust rods i.e., lease rods and on the loom in comparison to Size B. The reduced shedding improves loom cleanliness and results in higher quality fabrics. Moreover, desizing and wax removal from the fabric woven with Size A was satisfactorily facilitated with only a standard enzyme technique while the fabric woven employing SizeB required a solvent desize in order to provide satisfactory wax removal. EXAMPLE 3 Size formulations C E were prepared and evaluated as in Example 2 on 26 1 yarns for a 65 35 polyester cotton fabric of 96 x 60 construction. The size formulations in addition to size content and weaving efficiency data may be found in Table I. Formulation C D EStarch succinate of 45.36 100 45.36 100 45.36 100 Example 1 kg. lb.

In a like manner, starches may be reacted with other suitable substituted dicarboxylic acid anhydrides such as those listed below and employed in warp sizing compositions with similar results expected pentyl succinic anhydride pentenyl succinic anhydride hexyl succinic anhydride octyl succinic anhydride nonenyl succinic anhydride decyl succinic anhydride decenyl succinic anhydride dodecyl succinic anhydride dodecenyl succinic anhydride tetradecyl succinic anhydride tetradecenyl succinic anhydride hexadecyl succinic anhydride hexadecenyl succinic anhydride octadecyl succinic anhydride 3 methyl hexenyl succinic anhydride EXAMPLE 4 This example demonstrates the use of the present invention on a high speed loom.A starch succinate made as in Example 1 was used to cize 35 1 yarns for a 50 50 polyester cotton fabric of 74 x 54 construction printcloth . Size F was prepared consisting of 90.72 kg. 200 lb. of a starch succinate having a WF of 40 and made according to Example 1 with 1 OSA based on starch solids 13.61 kg. 30 lb. mill wax 90.72 200 lb. polyvinyl alcohol and 890 1. 235 gal. water. Comparative Size G, another conventional size for this style, was prepared with 79.38 kg. 175 lb. acetylated fluidity corn starch WF 50 starch reacted with 4 acetic anhydride as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,461,139 issuedFebruary 8, 1949 to C. Caldwell 11.34 kg. 25 Ib. mill wax 79.38 kg. 175 lb. polyvinyl alcohol 31.75 kg. 70 lb. 50 aqueous polyester binder and 890 l. 235 gal. water. The sizes were applied to warp yarns which were woven on a Ruti high speed air jet loom run at a rate of 450 yarn insertions per minute. The size content and weaving efficiency data of the yarns may be found in Table II. Table II Size F Size G Size content 10.4 10.3 Weaving efficiency 97 98 94 96 EXAMPLE 5 This example illustrates a laboratory study of the wax removeability of the size compositions of the present invention by observing the dye receptivity of enzyme desized fabric which had been impregnated with size compositions containing 206 wax based on starch content . Starch succinate derivatives were prepared as described in Example 1 by treating a fluidity corn starch 40 WF with 1,3,5, or 10 OSA, based on starch solids. As an indication of reaction efficiency, the starch half acid esters were evaluated by carboxyl titration and found to contain 0.85, 2.96, 3.74, and 6.42 carboxyl groups, respectively. Size dispersions containing mill wax were prepared and evaluated according to the Dye Receptivity Test procedure described above employing the starch succinate derivatives and a comparative fluidity corn starch WF 40 . The desized fabrics which had been treated with the starch succinate dispersions were all similar in appearance after dyeing. The fabrics treated with these sizes were more uniformly dyed and had significantly deeper dye penetration in comparison to the fabric treated with the comparative starch size. This indicates the wax of the size formulations containing the starch succinate derivatives was more effectively removed during desizing. EXAMPLE 6 This example illustrates the effect of the starch derivatives herein to facilitate the removal of larger quantities of wax by comparing two sizing compositions containing 50 wax based on starch content . The starch succinate derivatives of Example 5 prepared from 40 WF corn starch and 1 or 3 OSA based on starch solids were evaluated by the Dye Receptivity Test as above except the size dispersions each contained 8.8 starch and 4.4 mill wax as opposed to 1.8 wax . Dye penetration of the desized fabric which had been treated with the size containing the 3 OSA starch derivative was significantly deeper than the fabric treated with size containing the less substituted starch derivative. The results indicate that when larger amounts of wax are employed in a size formulation, more highly substituted starch succinate derivatives will facilitate better wax removal during desizing. EXAMPLE 7 This example illustrates the effect of the starch derivatives herein to facilitate the removal of paraffin, another typical lubricant employed in warp size formulations. Size dispersions were prepared and evaluated as described in the procedure for the Dye Receptivity Test with the exception that paraffin was employed at levels of 10 and 20 based on starch solids instead of the mill wax. Dispersions were prepared with the OSA starch of Example 1 and a comparative fluidity corn starch WF 40 . In order to thoroughly disperse the paraffin, the size compositions were continuously agitated during cooking. The desized fabric which had been treated with OSA starch and 10 or 20 paraffin were quite similar in appearance, both exhibiting excellent dye penetration indicative of complete and near complete paraffin removal, respectively. With 10 paraffin, the comparative starch size provided slighly inferior paraffin removal to that of theOSA starch size containing 20 paraffin. The comparative starch size containing 20 paraffin, however, was drastically inferior with the desized fabric containing numerous resist spots. EXAMPLE 8 Starch succinate derivatives were prepared as described in Example 1 by treating a fluidity corn starch 41 WF with 3 pentenyl succinic anhydride or 3 hexenyl succinic anhydride, based on starch solids.Fabrics treated with size dispersions containing the starch derivatives and 20 wax based on starch content were evaluated by the DyeReceptivity Test. Fabric treated with a comparative fluidity corn starch WF 40 was also evaluated. The desized fabrics which had been treated with the dispersions containing the starch succinate derivatives were similar in appearance after dyeing. The uniformity and depth of dye penetration were significantly better than that exhibited by the desized fabric which had been treated with the comparative fluidity starch dispersion. EXAMPLE 9 This example demonstrates the ability of another starch derivative suitable for use in warp size compositions to provide improved wax removability during desizing. Unhydrolyzed waxy maize starch was reacted with 5 or 10 tetradecenyl succinic anhydride TDSA as described in Example 1 in the presence of 0.7 parts based on starch solids of tricaprylmethyl ammonium chloride phase transfer agent at a pH of 8 instead of 7.5. Size dispersions containing mill wax were prepared and evaluated by the Dye Receptivity Test employing the TDSA derivatives and two comparative fluidity corn starches having WF s of 20 and 40. The desized fabrics which had been treated with the TDSA derivatives had significantly deeper dye penetration with the fabric treated with more highly substituted TDSA derivative having the darkest color .The results indicate that superior wax removal was achieved with the sizes containing the TDSA starches. EXAMPLE 10 This example illustrates the improved wax removability provided by starch derivatives suitable for use in warp size compositions which are prepared by additionally treating conventional sizing starches with a long hydrocarbon chain substituted succinic anhydride. A. An acetylated fluidity corn starch described in Example 4 was prepared. A portion of this starch was additionally treated with 3 OSA. Sizing compositions containing the two starches were compared for wax removability by the Dye Receptivity Test. More uniform dye penetration of the fabric treated with the OSA derivatized starch was observed indicating the hydrophobic derivatization facilitated improved wax removability. B. Another conventional starch employed as a warp size was prepared by reacting high amylose corn starch containing approximately 50 amylose with 6 diethylaminoethylchloride hydrochloride as described in U.S. 2,876,217 cited previously . A portion of this starch was additionally treated with 3 OSA. Sizing compositions containing the two starches were also compared as above. The fabric treated with the OSA derivatized starch was observed to have deeper dye penetration indicating the hydrophobic derivatization provided improved wax removal during desizing. EXAMPLE 11 Starch ester derivatives, prepared employing N,N disubstituted imidazolium salts of long hydrocarbon chain carboxylic acids are also suitable for use in warp sizing compositions. This example demonstrates the ability of these derivatives to facilitate improved wax removal during desizing. Corn starch was acid hydrolyzed to a WF of 41 then reacted with 5 or 10 N decanoyl N methylimidazolium chloride based on starch solids employing a procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,272 cited previously . The procedure comprised slurrying 100 parts corn starch as is in 150 parts water at pH 8 and then slowly adding the reagent to the slurry. The reaction was conducted for 2 to 3 hours at room tewperature while maintaining the pH at 8 as described in Example 1.When the reaction is complete, the pH of the slurry was adjusted to 4 with 3 1 hydrochloric acid. The starch ester derivatives were recovered by fitration, washed three times with water having a pH of about 4, and air dried. Size dispersions containing the ester derivatives and mill wax were evaluated by the Dye Receptivity Test and compared to a similar dispersion containing an underivatized fluidity corn starch WF 40 . Dye penetration of the fabrics treated with the starch ester derivatives was deeper in comparison to the fabric treated with the underivatized corn starch size. Dye uniformity of the fabric treated with the more highly substituted starch ester was also noted to be by far the best of the series. The results indicate that the hydrophobic starch esters are useful in facilitating wax removal during desizing. Other suitable esterifying reagents which may be employed in the preparation of starch derivatives useful in warp size compositions with similar effectiveness expected include, for example, the N,N disubstituted imadazolium salts of the following acids hexanoic acid 2 ethylhexanoic acid caprylic acid lauric acid myristic acid palmitic acid. EXAMPLE 12 Starch ether derivatives, prepared by employing long hydrocarbon chain quaternary amine epoxide reagents, are suitable for use in warp sizing compositions. This example demonstrates the ability of these derivatives to also provide improved wax removability during desizing. Corn starch was acid hydrolyzed to a WF of 41 then reacted with 5 or 10 dimethylglycidyl N dodecyl ammonium chloride based on starch solids employing the procedure described in U.S. Pat. 2,876,271 cited previously . The procedure comprised slurrying 100 parts starch as is in 150 parts water containing 40 parts sodium sulfate and 3 parts sodium hydroxide. The reagent was added and the mixture was agitated for 16 hours at 1040F 40 C . Thereafter the pH was adjusted to 3 with 3 1 hydrochloric acid. The starch ethers were filtered methanol was added to aid in the filtration , then washed three times with water having a pH of about 3, and air dried. Size dispersions containing mill wax were prepared and evaluated by the Dye Receptivity Test employing the starch ether derivatives and a comparative underivatized fluidity corn starch WF 40 . The dye penetration of the desized fabric which had been treated with the less substituted starch ether derivative was poorer than that of the fabric treated with the underivatized corn starch size. Dye penetration and uniformity of the fabric treated with the more highly substituted starch ether, however, was far superior to that exhibited by the comparative sample. The results indicate that although both starch ether derivatives are useful in warp sizing compositions, in order to facilitate sufficient wax removal when employing high concentrations of about 20 based on starch , the more highly substituted starch ether is preferably employed. In a like manner, starches may be reacted with other substituted quaternary amine epoxide reagents and employed in warp size compositions with similar effectiveness expected. Suitable reagents include, for example, the reaction products of epihalohydrins with one of the long chain tertiary amines listed below pentyldimethylamine hexyl dimethyl amine octyl di methyl ami ne 2 ethylhexyldimethylamine nonyl dimethyl amine decyldimethylamine decenyl di methyl amine dodecenyldimethylamine tetradecyldimethylamine tetradecenyldimethylamine hexadecyldimethylamine hexadecenyl dimethyl amine octadecyldimethylamine octadecenyldimethylamine. didecylmethylamine Summarizing, a warp sizing composition and a process for the use thereof are provided whereby the composition is capable of strengthening and protecting warp yarns to withstand loom abrasion as well as facilitating uniform textile lubricant dispersion onto the warp yarns and providing efficient lubricant removal during desizing.
