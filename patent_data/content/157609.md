## Description
The present invention relates to novel lipid derivatives which are of value as pharmaceuticals. PAF Platelet Activating Factor possesses the structure of a phospholiphid and is a chemical transmitter which exists in living organisms. It has been clarified that PAF, as its in vivo function, is closely involved in allergy, anaphylaxis and inflammation as well as platelet aggregation, and furthermore, PAF is known to exhibit potent hypotensive activity. When PAF is given to animals, on the other hand, complication of these activities causes the animals to produce symptoms of shock, occasionally leading to death. The shock produced by PAF resembles symptoms of shock due to endotoxin, and PAF is suspected to be involved in the endotoxin shock. With reference to the metastasis of cancer, it is thought that platelet aggregation is implicated in the stage of implantation of cancer cells, and lipid derivatives having the ether and carbamoyl bonds, because enzymes capable of breaking such bonds are deficient particuarly in cancer cells, further tend to accumulate in cancer cells and exhibit the action to bring about change in the lipid metabolism within the cancer cell, eventually resulting in death of cancer cells.

With use of an injection syringe containing 3.15 citric acid at a ratio of 1 part against 9 parts of blood as an anticoagulant, blood was collected by cardiac puncture from a male rabbit. The blood was then centrifuged at room temperature at 800 r.p.m. for 10 minutes to prepare platelet rich plasma PRP . The remaining blood was further centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes to separate platelet poor plasma PPP as a supernatant liquid. The PRP was diluted with the PPP to adjust the number of platelets to about 5 x 10⁵ per µl. This PRP 250 µl was stirred at 37 C for 2 minutes, and a test drug was added. After the mixture was stirred for 2 minutes, 1 x 10 ⁸M of PAF was added to the mixture. Platelet aggregation was determined with an aggregometer manufactured by Rika Denki K.K. . The inhibitory activity on platelet aggregation of the test drug was determined from the inhibition rate in relation to the maximum transmission maximum aggregation ratio of control PRP by PAF. The test compounds were investigated for the inhibitory activity against platelet aggregation by PAF, The results are shown in Table 1. The test drug was investigated for the preventive activity against shock death to be brought about within 30 min. after 50 µg kg for PAF in the form of 0.1 ml kg physiological saline solution was given intravenously to a male Jcl ICR mouse. The test drug was administered intravenously 5 min. before the injection of PAF. The test compounds were investigated for the preventive activity against PAF induced death in mice. The results are shown in Table 2. Male S.D. rats, aged 16 weeks, were employed. Under anesthesia with pentobarbital, cannulas were inserted into the femoral artery and vein of rats for measurement of blood pressure and for administration of a drug, respectively. Three 3 minutes after intravenous administration of 1 µg kg 0.25 BAS physiological saline solution volume of 0.2 ml kg of PAF, a test drug physiological saline solution volume of 0.5 ml kg was administered intravenously, and blood pressure was measured for subsequent 1 hour. The ratio of hypertension by the test drug to hypotension by PAF was taken as a restoration rate. Restoration rate Blood pressure just before i.v. administration of a test drug Blood pressure 1 min. after i.v. administration of a test drug Blood pressure just before i.v. administration of PAF Blood pressure just before i.v. administration of a test drug x 100 The results are shown in Table 3. In accordance with the same procedure as described in Experiment Example 1, the test compounds were investigated for the inhibitory activity against platelet aggregation by PAF. The results are shown in Table 4. Male Spraque Dawley rats, with a body weight of about 400 g, were used under pentobarbital sodium 50 mg kg, intravenous administration anesthesia. A cannula was inserted into the femoral artery and secured in position for measurement of blood pressure and another cannula into the femoral vein for administration of a solution of the drug. The blood pressure was measured via a pressure transducer and recorded on a polygraph. First, 0.3 µg kg of PAF was administered intravenously and the hypotensive response was recorded. The inhibitory activity against PAF induced hypotension was estimated from the rate of PAF induced hypotensive response Δ mmHg after the drug administration to hypotensive response Δ mmHg by PAF before the drug administration. The results are shown in Table 5. Male Spraque Dawley rats weighing about 400 g were used under pentobarbital sodium 50 mg kg, i.v. anesthesia. A cannula was inserted into the femoral artery and secured in position for measurement of blood pressure and another cannula into femoral vein for administration of a solution of the drug. The blood pressure was measured via a pressure transducer and recorded on a polygraph. First, a suspension of endotoxin 15 mg kg Lipopolysaccharide W.E. coli 0111 B4, Wako Pure Chemical in physiological saline was administered intravenously and the maximum hypotensive response Δ mmHg occurring 3 to 5 minutes after administration was recorded. Simultaneously, the compound of Example 8 was dissolved in physiological saline and administered intravenously in a dose of 1 to 100 µg kg. The restoration rate against endotoxin induced hypotension one minute after the administration was calculated. The presence of preventive activity against endotoxin shock was judged from the strength of the restoration rate. The results are shown in Table 6.
