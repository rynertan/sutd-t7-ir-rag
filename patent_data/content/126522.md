## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITORS This invention relates to electrolytic capacitors and in particular to electrolyte compositions for use in such capacitors. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an electrolyte for an aluminium electrolytic capacitor, characterised in that the electrolyte comprises a solution in dimethyl formamide of a tertiary aliphatic amine together with an acidic component including maleic acid. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided an aluminium wet electrolytic capacitor, including first and second electrode foils at least one of which is provided with a dielectric surface layer, and an electrolyte in contact with the dielectric layer, characterised in that said electrolyte comprises a solution in dimethyl formamide of a tertiary aliphatic amine, and an acidic component including maleic acid. Advantageously the acidic component of the electrolyte also includes boric acid which has been found to provide a high electrical conductivity. The acidic component may also contain one or more inhibiting agents such as orthophosphoric acid which improve the ability of the aluminium foil to reform surface oxide in the event of local failure. We have found that such electrolytes provide improved scintillation voltages and have a significant beneficial effect on the formation characteristics of aluminium net electrolytic capacitors. The tertiary amine may comprise triethylamine or tributylamine. Preferably the conductivity of the electrolyte at ambient temperature is greater than 5 millisiemens. We have found that a particularly advantageous high conductivity electrolyte composition can be formed from a mixture of dimethyl formamide DMF , triethylamine, maleic acid, boric acid and orthophosphoric acid in the following proportions DMF 100 ml Triethylamine 8.8 ml Maleic acid 8.16 g Boric acid 1 g Orthophosphoric acid 0.1 ml This composition provides a scintillation voltage of 216 volts at 200C and 210 volts at 1050C.The conductivity was measured over a range of temperatures, the results being shown in Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings. Both boric acid and phosphoric acid have a significant effect on the scintillation voltages and formation characteristics of anodised aluminium foils.To demonstrate these effects a stock solution of 0.7 molar maleic acid in DMF and trimethylamine TEA was prepared. An aluminium foil type 934 was cut into 1 cm square test pieces which were then anodised either in the stock solution or in the stock solution containing phosphoric acid H3P04 and boric acid. The anodisation voltages and current were monitored during the forming process. The voltage was found to rise slowly and smoothly until a threshold was reached at which current spikes were observed. This threshold was taken as the scintillation voltage. The results of the tests are suxmarised in the following table. Table 1 0.7 molar maleic Conductivity Scintillation Charge in DMF TEA ms voltage coulombs 1. Cold 11.0 98 volts 8.1 2. Heated to 1400C cooled 11.6 93 7.2 3. 0.1 H3P04 11.5 185 12.8 4. 0.1 H3P04 1 boric acid 11.2 216 15.8 5. 0.1 H3P04 at 1050C 18.3 216 17.0 As can be seen from the table that addition of 0.18 phosphoric acid approximately doubles the scintillation voltage whilst the addition of 1 boric acid further increases this voltage. The conductivity of the electrolyte is significantly higher than that of conventional compositions and can be enhanced by optimising the ratio of amine to acid. To determine this optimum value a series of solutions of maleic acid in DMF were prepared. To each of these solutions the tertiary amine was added slowly and the conductivity was determined. The conductivity was found to increase to a peak value followed by a slow decrease with further addition of the amine. The measured pedk conductivity values for tributylamine TBA and triethylamine TEA are summarised in Table 2 below.
