# Apparatus housing comprising a number of parallel component boards.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus housing, com prising a first wall 1 and a second wall 2 which are interconnected by means of side walls 3, 4 and where between a number of parallel component boards 5 are detachably arranged, transversely of the first wall 1 and the second wall 2 . Each of the component boards 5 is detachably connected, by way of an edge, to a third wall 8 of the housing which is arranged transversely of the side walls 3, 4 and the first wall 1 and the second wall 2 . At their edge which is remote from the connection, the component boards 5 are provided with a guide bracket 12 whereby they are located in the housing. The guide brackets 12 are clamped onto the component boards 5 and serve as spacers between these boards 5 and the walls 1, 2, 3, 4 of the apparatus housing. The boards 5 can thus be symply slid into and out of the apparatus housing which may have a comparatively light and inex pensive construction, because only few and light compo nents are required for the locating of the component boards 5 .
