## Description
Microorganism of the genus Serratia containing a hybrid plasmid and process for preparing the same This invention relates to a novel microorganism and a method for producing L proline. More particularly, it relates to a novel microorganism of the genus Serratia and a method for producing L proline by using said microorganism. L proline is an important amino acid useful as a drug or food additive and is prepared by using various microorganisms of the genera Brevlbacterium, Micrococcus, Kruthia,Saccharomvces, Bacillus, Escherichia and so forth. However, wild strains of microorganisn of the genus Serratia do not produce and accumulate L proline because said strains have potent L proline degrading enzyme activity and, at the same time,are subject to metabolic regulation in L proline biosynthesis. We have previously found that mutants derived from a microorganism of the genus Serratia, for example, a mutant which is defective in a L proline degrading enzyme and resistant to a proline analog and or purine analog and a mutant which is defective in a L proline degrading enzyme and resistant to a proline analog under increased osmotic pressure, have L proline producing activity Japanese PatentPublication unexamined Nos. 60995 1983 and 224696 1983 . As a result of various investigations, we have now found that a microorganism of the genus Serratia having more potent L proline producing activity than that of the abovementioned known mutant of the genus Serratia can be obtained by isolating a chromosomal DNA deoxyribonucleic acid fragment encoding enzymes of proline synthesis from said known mutant, joining a vector plasmid to said chromosomalDNA fragment and then introducing the resultant hybrid plasmid into a microorganism of the genus Serratia. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel microorganism useful for the industrial production ofL proline. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for the production of L proline. These objects as well as other objects will be apparent to thcse skilled in the art from the following description. According to the present invention, there is provided a novel microorganism of the genus Serratia containing a hybrid plasmid prepared by joining a vector plasmid to a chromosomal DNA fragment encoding enzymes of proline synthesis which is obtained from a chromosomal DNA of a microorganism of the genus Serratia having L prolin producing activity.There is also provided a method for producing L proline which comprises cultivating microbial cells of the above mentioned novel microorganism in a nutrient medium to produce and accumulate L proline in the medium and then recovering the L proline therefrom. Throughout the specification and claims, the chromosomalDNA fragment encoding enzymes of proline synthesis stands for deoxyribonucleic acid DNA carring at least one of genes for enzymes involved in the synthesis of pro line from glutamic acid, i.e., gene for t glutamyl kinase hereinafter referred to as prow , gene for glutamyl phosphate reductase hereinafter referred to as prOA and gene for pyrroline 5carboxylate reductase hereinafter referred to as prow . Preferable examples of the chromosomal DNA fragment are DNA containing proB, proA and proC and DNA containing oroB and prow. It is preferred that ProB contained in the chromosomalDNA fragment is a mutation type gene which is not subject to feedback control.Preparation of microorganisms of the present invention Chromosomal DNA and preparation thereof Microorganisms to be used as a source of the abovementioned chromosomal DNA are not limited to a specific one so far as it is a microorganism of the genus Serratia havingL proline producing activity. Examples of such microorgansms include Serratia marcescens which is defective in a L prolinedegrading enzyme and resistant to a proline analog and or a purine analoq, Serratia marcesecens which is defective in aL proline degrading enzyme and resistant to a proline analog under increased osmotic pressure, and the like.Representative examples of such microorganisms are Serratia marcescensDTr 12 FERM BP 171 i.e., a mutant which is defective inL proline oxidase and resistant to 3,4 dehydro DL proline and L thiazolidine 4 carboxylic acid , Serratia marcescensOAr 80 FERM SP 173 i.e., a mutant which is defective inL proline oxidase and resistant to L azetidine 2 carboxylic acid in the presence of a high concentration of sodium chloride , and the like. Isolation of chromosomal DNA from the above mentioned microorganism may be accomplished by a conventional method, for example, by lysing microbial cells of said microorganism with lysozyme and a detergent e.g., SDS chemical name sodium dodecyl sulfate , sarcosil chemical name sodiumN lauroylsarcosinate , ete deproteinizing the lysate and then precipitating chromosomal DNA with ethanol J. Mol.Biol., 3, 208 1961 Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 72, 619 1963 . Vector plasmid DNA and preparation thereof The vector plasmid to be joined to the chromosomalDNA fragment is not limited to a specific one so far as it is capable of being introduced into a microorganism of the genus Serratia and is replicable in said microorganism.Examples of such vector plasmid include pACYC177 J.Bacteriol., 134, 1141 1978 , pBR322 Gene, 2, 95 1977 , pBR313 Gene, 2, 75 1977 , pBR325 Gene, 4, 121 1978 , pMB1 Fed. Proc., 35, 2973 1976 , mini F derived plasmids such as pKP1155 Mol. Gen. Genet., 191, 231 237 1983 plasmid pKP1155 being prepared by joining ampicillin , chloramphenicol , spectinomycin and streptomycin resistant genes to a mini F i.e., the fragment containing regions B, C and A2 for replication initiation obtained from F plasmid EcoRI f5 fragment Proc. Nat. Aca. 5ci., 73, 64 1976 0, and the like.These plasmids are preferably used for preparation of hybrid plasmid after introducing into a microorganism of the genusSerratia and then extracting from said microorganism by a conventional method. Preparation of hybrid plasmid The hybrid plasmid may be prepared from the chromosomalDNA and the vector plasmid by a conventional method te.g., Method in Enzymology, 68, 41 1979 IDENSHI SOSA JIKKE HO Experimental Method in Genetic Manipulation , Ed. by Y. Takagi, Kodan sha Scientific Co., Japan, 135 159 1980 . For example, the hybrid plasmid is prepared by treating the chromosomal DNA and the vector plasmid DNA with a restriction endonuclease e.g., HindIII, PstI, BairHI, etc. to cut theDNA strands and then treating the resultant DNA fragments i.e., chromosomal DNA fragment and vector plasmid DNA fragment with a ligase e.g., T4 DNA ligase, Escherichia coli ligase, etc to join the DNA strands. Depending upon the nature of the termini of the DNA fragments, the hybrid plasmid may be prepared by treating the DNA fragments with terminal transferase, DNA polymerase, etc. and then treating with a ligase to join the DNA strands. The hybrid plasmid thus obtained may be used for transformation as it is. In order to facilitate the selection of a transformant containing the desired hybrid plasmid, however, the hybrid plasmid obtained above is preferably used after introducing the hybrid plasmid obtained above into a mutant, selecting microbial cells containing the desired hybrid plasmid and then extracting said plasmid therefrom by a conventional method. The mutant to be used for this purpose includes, for example, microorganisms of the genus Serratia or Escherichia which do not show prolineproducing activity or are sensitive to antibiotics e.g., ampicillin, kanamicin . Host microorganisms The host microorganism into which the hybrid plasmid is introduced is not limited to a specific one so far as it is a transformable microorganism of the genus Serratia.For example, the microorganisms used as the source of the chromosomal DNA are preferably used as the host microorganism.Wild strains of Seratia marcescens are also used as the host microorganism. Transformation by hybrid plasmid The transformation of the host microorganism by the hybrid plasmid may be carried out by a conventional method, for example, by treating microbial cells of the host microorganism with a calcium chloride solution to increase the permeability of the cell wall, and then introducing the hybrid plasmid DNA into said microorganism J. Mol. Biol., 53, 159 1970 . Proline producing microbial cells are selected among the colonies cf the transformant obtained above.Thus, there is obtained the microorganism of the present invention, i.e., the microorganism of the genus Serratia containing a hybrid plasmid prepared by joining a vector plasmid to a chromosomal DNA fragment carrying the gene for L proline synthesis which is obtained from a chromosomal DNA of a microorganism of the genus Serratia having L proline producing activity. The representative microorganisms of the present invention have been deposited with Fermentation ResearchInstitute FRI , Agency of Industrial Science and Technology,Ibaraki ken, Japan under Budapest Treaty on 12th December, 1983.They are Serratia marcescens TA5006 FERM BP 649 , Serratia marcescens TA5007 FERM BP 650 , Serratia marcescens TA5008 FERM BP 651 and Serratia marcescens TA5009 FERM BP 652 . Productin of L proline Since the microorganism of the present invention has a potent L proline producting activity, L proline can be prepared by using said microorganism. That is, L proline can be prepared by cultivating the microorganism of the present invention in a nutrient medium to produce and accumulate L proline in a nutrient medium and then recovering the L proline therefrom. As the medium to be used for production of L proline, there may be used a conventional nutrient medium containing 10 tD 2Q w v of carbon sources such as saccharides e.g., glucose, sucrose, molasses , organic acids e.g., succinic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid or sugar alcohols e.g., glycerol 1 to 5 w v of nitrogen sources such as organic ammonium salts e.g., ammonium fumarate, ammonium succinate , inorganic ammonium salts e.g., ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride or urea 0 to 1 w v of organic nutrients such as corn steep liquor, peptone or yeast extract and a small amount of inorganic substances such as potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate or ferrous sulfate.In order to adjust the medium to pH 6 to 8, calcium carbonate, ammonia, citric acid anc the , ce may be added to the medium. Further, a precursor for L proline biosynthesis e.g., L glutamic acid,L aspartic acid may be added to the medium. The cultivation of the microorganism of the present invention may be carried out by a conventional method, for example, by inoculating microbial cells of said microorganism in the nutrient medium and incubating at 250 to 400C for 2 to 6 days under aerobic conditions. L proline thus produced and accumulated in the medium may be recovered by a conventional method, for example, by removing microbial cells and other insoluble materials from the culture medium, passing the resultant solution through a column packed with an ion exchange resin to adsorb L proline eluting the adsorbed L proline with an aqueous ammonia solution, condensing the eluate and then precipitating crystals of L proline therefrom. The following Examples further illustrate the present invention in detail but are not to be construed to limit the scope thereof.
