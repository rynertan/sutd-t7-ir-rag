# Drive shaft coupling.

## Abstract
Drive shaft apparatus including drive means having driving and driven ends 4C,8A , primary torque transmitting means 2 coupling the driving and driven ends 4C,8A , re dundant torque transmitting means 3 rendered operative for coupling the driving and driven ends 4C,8A in the event of a failure of the primary coupling means 2 and a failure detector including electrical circuitry 18 associated with the redundant coupling means 3 which detects the oper ation thereof and provides a corresponding indication.
