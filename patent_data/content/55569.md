# DISTANCE MEASURING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A distance measuring device or proximity detector has an ultrasonic transducer 1, 35 which acts to direct ultrasonic energy at an object and to receive reflected energy there from, the time difference between transmitted and received pulses being used to give an indication of the distance between the transducer and the object. The measured distance may be indicated visually and audibly. In one embodiment the measured distance is displayed numerically on a digital display device 34 and an audible warning is given if the displayed distance falls below a preset value. The transducer may be mounted on the back of a vehicle to assist in reversing and a cover 44 may be provided to protect the transducer when not in use.
