## Description
TOPICAL COMPOSITIONS FOR LOWERING INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE This invention relates to topical compositions for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension with cc adrenergics. More particularly, this invention relates to topical compositions lowering intraocular pressure hereinafter IOP which contain an effective amount of particular 2 trisubstituted phenylimino imidazoline compounds, also known as 2 trisubstituted anilino l, 3 diazacylopentene 2 compounds. In glaucoma and ocular hypertension, the high pressure within the effected eye presses against the blood vessels nourishing the optic nerve head and retina.When these blood vessels collapse under abnormal ocular pressure, an atrophy of specific regions of the retina results which ultimately is related to loss of vision and blindness. It is know that certain adrenergics, such as clonidine, also known as 2 2 ,61 dichloroani lino 1,3 diazacyclopentene 2 and under the naming and indexing of chemical substances for Chemical Abstracts as 2, 6 dichloro N 2 imidazolidinylidene benzamine, are capable of lowering IOP. However, these compounds effect the central nervous system and lower systemic blood pressure, cause drowsiness and other undesirable side effect. Unexpectedly, it has been discovered that the compositions of the invention exert a selective and local ocular pharmacological action which lowers IOP without lowering systemic blood pressure. When the compositions of the invention are applied topically to the eye they do not have to cross the blood barrier of the brain to effect IOP lowering. These compositions lower IOP through a local or peripheral adrenergic action at dose levels which selectively lower IOP without significantly affecting the central nervous system. The IOP lowering action of the compositions of the invention is unexpected because the locus of clonidine action has been deemed in the art to be primarily mediated by the brain. The compositions of the invention surprisingly have been found to be excluded from the significant absorption into the central nervous system or brain when administered topically at concentrations required to lower ocular IOP. Unexpectedly, therefore, it has been found that the compositions of the invention exert a potent IOP Lowering by a local action without significantly lowering systemic blood pressure or causing other central nervous system side effects such as drowsiness. Accordingly the present invention provides a topical composition for administration to the eye which comprises an amount effective to lower intraocular pressure of at least on compound of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein I. Rl R2 methyl, ethyl, trifluoromethyl, chloro or bromo, Rl num R2 and each methyl, ethyl, trifluoromethyl, fluoro, chloro or bromo, one of R3 and R4 is H and the other isEMI2.2 R5 R6 H or lower alkyl, R5 Z R6 and each H, lower alkyl, R7 H, lower alkyl 2 hydroxyethyl, 2 hydroxypropyl or 3 hydroxypropyl, the sum of the carbon atoms in R5 and R6 or R5 and R7 being 4 or less orEMI3.1 R8 lower alkyl II.R1 methyl, ethyl, trifluoromethyl, chloro or bromo, R2 H, R3 is selected fromEMI3.2 R4 methyl, chloro or bromo Rg H or lower alkyl, R10 H, lower alkyl, 2 hydromethyl, 2 hydroxypropyl or 3 hydroxypropyl, the sum of the carbon atoms in Rg and R10 being 4 or less, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The alkyl substituents may be straight or branched chain. Generally methyl and ethyl derivatives are prepared because they do not easily enter the central nervous system relative to larger alkyl groups. The compositions of the invention may be in the form of solutions, gels or ointments The compounds may be in the form of the free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, such as the monohydrochloride or the dihydrochloride. The topical compositions are formulated to contain a pharmaceutically effective amount of the compounds which may vary from composition to composition. Generally, the compositions will contain from 0.01 to 1.5 w v based upon the equivalent weight of the compound free base. The composition may be suitably preserved, in accordance with known practices, with a pharmaceutically acceptable preservative such as benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, methylparaben or propylparaben. If desired, the compositions may contain suitable buffers such as phosphate, acetate, citrate or borate ions to maintain the desired pH of the composition within the pharmaceutically acceptable range of from 4.0 and 8.0.Certain pH ranges are more acceptable for some of the compounds that are sensitive to ester hydrolysis. Other additives that are contemplated for inclusion in the topical compositions include sodium chloride or mannitol for adjustment of osmolarity, thickners and or gelling agents such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylalcohol, and carboxypolymethylene Carbopol . Other ingredients such as EDTA may also be incorporated in the compositions provided they are compatible with the other ingredients and are pharmaceutically acceptable.

By the following biological procedures. A to E The data from the hereinafter described tests is illustrated in Table I.A. Rhesus Monkey Laser Model Ocular hypertension was produced in adultRhesus monkeys 4 via an argon laser photocoagulation of trabecular meshwork in the eye. The treated eye only one is lasered was allowed to heal and the IOP stabilized after about six weeks. Tests were performed by topical administration of one drop of a 0.5 solution of the test agent to the Ketamine anesthetized Rhesus monkeys eye. The IOP charge was recorded by an AlconApplanation Phneumatonograph. The peak effect was recorded as a percentage change in the hypertensioned eye versus the IOP value of the same eye recorded at the same hour the previous day.B. Normal Rabbit Model To determine the IOP reduction efficacy of the anti glaucoma drugs of the invention in normal albino rabbits the following was done. New Zealand albino rabbits 12 were acclimatized in restraining boxes for thirty minutes. Alcaine saline 1 5 was applied to the rabbit eyes and baselineIOP in mm Hg pressure were measured using an AlconLaboratory Applanation Phneumatonograph. Then thirty minutes later, the coded test substance versus a coded saline control was administered as a 50 ul drop to one eye, six animals in each group. The treatment effects were measured as a function of time. Mean IOP and mean change in IOP for each hourly reading was recorded.The effect cited is a peak percentage effect versus the external control test group.C. The Steroid Rabbit Model Biological procedures for measuring IOP effects of drugs in the steroid rabbit model are given in B. L. Bonomi and L. Tomayzol, Invest.Ophthal. 15, 781,784 1976 and L. Bonomi et al.,Albrect Graefes Arch. Ophthal., 209, 73, 89.Luciano Bonomi et al., Albrect Graefes Arch. Ophthal., 219, 1, 8, 1979 shows the model works for known antiglaucoma drugs. In the experiments shown in Table I, a drop of the drug was administered to one eye of the subject rabbit and the IOP in the treated eye was monitored as a function of time.D. 20 Blood Pressure Decrease In The Rat Six Sprague Dawley rats 6 per test group at 200 400 g. are anesthetized 65 mg kg sodium pentobarbital and placed on a heating pad. The femoral artery was cannulated and hydrolically connected to a pressure transducer and Grass Model 7 recorder. A fifteen minute blood pressure reading was recorded. A buffered test agent was given intravenously in a small volume i.e., 0.1 mL . The test agent effect on blood pressure was then recorded. The mean dose calculated to lower blood pressure 20 in the rat is given in ug kg.E. Potentiation of Hexobarbital Induced Anesthesia Concommitant intraparateneal administration of the test drug and hexobarbital to mice will result in an increase in the duration of anesthesia as compared to hexobarbital alone, if the test compound has sedative activity.
