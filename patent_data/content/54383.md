# Flare having noise attenuation.

## Abstract
A high pressure gas flare using the Coanda effect has a noise attenuator surrounding the high pressure gas outlet slot. The noise attenuator is in the form of one or more upwardly diverging frusto conical shields which may be spaced apart or closed with the body of the flare. The attenuator is particularly useful for steam driven flares.
