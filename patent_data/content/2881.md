The present compounds are pesticides and plant growth regulants.The compounds are outstandingly active on plant physiology, affecting the growth of plants so that the compounds may be used as herbicides or plant growth regulants, especially as selective herbicides. TIiey are also fungicides. rney are particularly useful for controlling weeds in crops. For use as fungicides, the compounds are preferably employed to combat fungal diseases of plants. The compounds are normally employed in the form of compositions, which can be prepared by admixing the ingredients. Usually the compositions are initially produced in the form of concentrates, e.g.containing 0.5 85t of the present compound, and these arc diluted with water or hydrocarbon, usually water, for application, generally such that the concentration of the compound is 0.05 5Z, though in ultra low volume application the concentration may be higher, e.g. up to 209. Percentages, proportions and parts in this specification are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The coppositions normally contain a surface active agent and or a carrier. The carrier may be a liquid, e.g. water e.g. water used to dilute a concentrate for application . If water is employed as carrier in a concentrate, an organic solvent may also be present as carrier, though this is not usually enployed. A surface active agent may advantageously be present. The carrier may be a liquid other than natter, for example an organic solvent, such as a water imniscible solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 2700C, in which the compound is dissolved or suspended. A concentrate containing a water immiscible solvent suitably also contains a surface active agent so that the concentrate acts as a self emulsifiable oil on admixture with water. The carrier may be a solid, which may be finely divided.Examples of suitable solids are limestone, clays, sand, mica, chalk, attapulgite, diatomite, perlite, sepiolite, silicas, silicates, lignosulphonates, peat and solid fertilizers. The carrier can be of natural or synthetic origin or can be a modified natural material. Wbttable powders soluble or dispersable in water may be formed by admixing the compound in particulate form with a particulate carrier or spraying molten compound on to the particulate carrier, admixing a wetting agent and a dispersing agent and finely grinding the whole powder mixture. An aerosol composition may he formed by admixing the compound with a propellant e.g. a pelyhalogenated alkane such as dichlorodifluaromethane, and suitably also with a solvent. A flowable suspension concentrate may be formed by grinding the compound with water, a wetting agent and a suspending agent. A flowable suspension concentrate wherein the carrier is a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 2700C rather than water may be formed. Thus the present composition can for example be solid e.g. dust or granules and contain a solid carrier, or liquid e.g. an emulsifiable concentrate and contain a liquid carrier which is a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 2700C The term surface active agent is used in the broad sense to include materials variously called emulsifying agents, dispersing agents and wetting agents. Such agents are well known in the art. The surface active agents used may comprise anionic surface active agents, for example mmo or di esters of phosphoric acid with fatty alcohol ethoxylates or salts of such esters, fatty alcohol sulphonates such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, ethoxylated alkylphenol sulphates, lignin sulphonates, petroleum sulphonates, alkyl aryl sulphonates such as alkyl benzene sulphonates or lower alkyl naphthalene sulphonates, salts of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenol formaldehyde condensates, or more complex sulphonates such as the amide sulphonates e.g. the sulphonated condensation product of oleic acid and N methyl taurine or the dialkyl sulphosuccinates e.g. the sodium sulphonate of dioctyl succinate. The surface active agents may also comprise non ionic agents, for example condensation products of fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or alkyl substituted phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers e.g.sorbitan fatty acid esters, condensation products of such esters with ethylene oxide e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7,9 tetramethyl S decyn 4,7 diol, or ethoxylated acetylenic glycols. The surface active agents may also comprise cationic agents, for example alkyl and or aryl substituted quaternary ammonium compounds such as cetyl trimethylammoniun bromide, or ethoxylated tertiary fatty amines. Preferred surface active agents include ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, lignin sulphonates, alkyl aryl sulphonates, salts of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenol formaldehyde condensates, sodium oleoylN methyltauride, dialkyl sulphosuccinates, alkyl phenol ethoxylates, and fatty alkyl ethoxylates. Higher quantities of surface active agent, e.g. 5 509 of a concentrate, than is normally present in commercial pesticidal or plant growth regulant compositions may be employed to increase the activity of the compounds. The present active compound may be admixed with another pesticide, e.g. herbicide, fungicide or insecticide, or with another plant growth regulant. The invention provides a one pack presentation, in which the present compound is already mixed with other pesticide or plant growth regulant, and also a single package designed to hold the present compound and other pesticide or plant growth regulant in separate containers, for mixing, e.g.in a spray tank, for application.

The ratio of the present compound to the other pesticide or plant growth regulant may vary over a wide range according to the particular compounds involved and the intended use. In general the ratio of present compound to other pesticide or plant growth regulant lies in the range 1 0.1 to 1 15. In a particular embodiment, ethyl 3 etllyl 5 3 propylureido isoxazole 4 carboxylate is employed as a selective herbicide in combination with chlortoluron N 3 chloro 4 methylphenyl N,N dimeftylurea and optionally mecoprop 2 4 drloro 2 mcthy Iphenoxy propanoic acid or a salt thereof , e.g. at rates respectively of 0.3, 2.5 and 2.0, kg per hectare. The present compounds may be in admixture with non phytotoxic oils, e.g. Fyzol llE, Agri Oil Plus or Sun Oil 11E. The compounds may be employed in association with a herbicidal antidote a substance having the property of improving the safety to crops of the compounds , e.g. N,N diallyl 2,2 dichloroacetamide, 4 chloro 2 hydroxyiminoacetanilide or 1,8 naphthalic anhydride. Although the antidote may be applied in admixture with one or more of the essential compounds, it is preferably applied separately, and especially as a treatment for crop seeds. The ratio by weight of total herbicide to antidote is preferably from 1 2 to 8 1.

The compounds may be in admixture with fertilizers. In the use of the present compounds as total herbicides, high rates of application, for example at least 10 kg per hectare, such as 10 25 kg per hectare, of the compounds are usually required, unless they are mixed with other herbicides, in which case the rate can be reduced. In tile use of the present compounds as selective herbicides, the rate of application is usually much lower and may be for example 0.05 10, preferably 0.1 4, kg per hectare. In a particular eiti odiitnt, the rate as a selective herbicide is 0.5 10, e.g.0.5 8, kg per hectare, such as 1 4 kg per hectare. In the use of the compounds as plant growth regulants, low rates of application are usually required such as 0.1 4, e.g. 0.5 1, kg per hectare. For use as fungicides, the compounds are generally applied at a rate of 1 6 kg per hectare. Me present compounds may be applied to plants, the soil, land or aquatic areas, or to inanimate or stored materials, e.g. textiles, paper, leather or wood, susceptible to fungal attack. They are outstanding herbicides, especially for selectively combating weeds by application to a locus at which a crop is growing or is to grow.Thus, the compounds may be applied pre or post planting of the crop.They may be employed for pre emergence use or post emergence use.The crop may be for instance a cereal crop, e.g. maize Zea mais , wheat CTriticum aestivium , barley tHordeum vulgare , rye Lolium spp. , oats Avena sativa or rice Oryza sativa , peas Pisum sativum , ryegrass Lolium perenne , potatoes Solanum spp , onions Allium cepa , navy beans Phaseolus vulgaris , sunflowers Helianthus spp , timothy grass, Phleum spp , peanuts Arachis hypogea , soyabeans Glycine max or cotton Gossypium spp , especially a cereal crop or potatoes, particularly a winter cereal crop. The present compounds are active against a wide range of weeds, e.g. nonocotyledonous weeds such as wild oats or blackgrass, and particularly active against broad leaved weeds. They are active for example against wild oats Avena fatua , blackgrass Alopecurus myosuroides , fat hen Chenopodium album , purslane Portulaca oleracea , prickly sida Sida spinoso , chickweed Stellaria media , mayweed Tripleurospermum maritinum , pale persicarea Polygonum lapathifoliui , speedwell Veronica persica , pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus , mustard Sinapsis alba , annual morning glory Ipomoea annua and sicklepod Cassia obtusifolia . The present compounds are also fungicides. They are active against fungal diseases of plants, e.g. rust fungal diseases. For use as fungicides, the compounds are preferably applied to crops, especially cereals or beans. Thus, the compounds can be used to protcct plants from weeds and fungus. r le invention is illustrated by the following Examples.Example 1 Ethyl 2 cyano 3 ethoxy 2 pentenoate 105 parts was slowly added to a stirred solution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride 48 parts and sodium hydroxide 27 parts in water 250 parts .
