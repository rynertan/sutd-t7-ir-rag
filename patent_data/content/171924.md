# RADIO FREQUENCY MULTIPLEXING FILTER USING FIBRE OPTIC DELAYS

## Abstract
A radio frequency multiplexing filter comprises a matrix network of individual fibre optic delays 5 connecting each of a number of input ports 3 ₂...3₂ to each of a number of output ports 4 ₂...4₂, the input ports all being coupled to a comon source of radio frequency modulated optical signals 1 via incremental time delays, the time delays being im plemented by fibre optic delay means connected to a single modulated light source 2, said fibre optic delay means being adapted to provide substantially equal amplitude optical signals to each of the input ports but with incremental time delays between said optical signals applied to said ports.
