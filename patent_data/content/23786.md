# One piece dispensing closure.

## Abstract
A one piece dispensing closure 20 has an annular skirt 22 on the inner side of which there are threads 25 or other means which co operate with means on a con tainer neck for retaining the closure on a container. The closure has a disc like top 27 in which there is a dis pensing opening 28 and a lid 23 for the opening which is an integral part of the closure and is hinged to the clo sure top at one edge thereof 29 . The lid has an integral plug 30 adapted to close the dispensing opening when the lid is swung over into closed position overlying the closure top. The closure top and underside of the lid have co operating projections, for example, ears 33 and a post 34 , which function to prevent the lid from swinging to closed position when the closure is turned to position for dispensing content material and which can be manually inter engaged for retaining the lid in closed position when desired.
