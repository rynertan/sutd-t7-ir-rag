# Fastener.

## Abstract
An improved fastener includes a shank section 78 which is coaxial with and extends outwardly from a head section 14 . The head section has a rim 16 which cooperates with the shank section to form a groove 20 in which sheet metal is received. The head and shank sections have arcuate indenta tions into which the sheet metal is forced. In addition, the shank section has arcuate outer side surfaces which oppose flat outer side surfaces on the rim. Due to the difference in the configuration of the side surfaces of the rim and shank sec tions, constrictions are formed between the rim and shank sec tions. Each constriction tends to deform or extrude sheet metal upon the applicaton of torque to the fastener. The corners of the indentations in the shank sections and the rim apply shear forces to the sheet metal to further resist relative rotation be tween the fastener and the sheet metal. The indentations in the rim of the fastener have sloping side surfaces 100 to promote a smooth flow of the sheet metal into the groove upon mount ing of the fastener in the sheet metal.
