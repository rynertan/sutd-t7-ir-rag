## Description
The present invention relates to condition responsive control systems for controlling condition changing means, such as dampers in air conditioning systems. In ventilating and air conditioning systems, it is common to utilize dampers and or valves for controlling the temperature, humidity, and distribution of a fluid medium used in controlling conditions in an air conditioned space. Where air is used as the fluid medium, dampers may be used for mixing varying proportions of air at different temperatures and or humidities within the air conditioning system, mixing air within the system with variable amounts of outside air for achieving operating economies, and distributing conditioned air to areas within the conditioned space. The dampers and or valves are frequently positioned by means of either single direction or reversible electric motors. The motors are powered from an available primary power source such as electrical current supplied by a public utility. This electrical power is supplied to the motors under the control of one or more condition responsive sensors, such as thermostats, enthalpy sensors, etc., so as to achieve the desired conditions in the air conditioned space, and to do so economically. In installations employing a single direction motor, the motor is used to move the damper or similar device toward one position, and a return spring is typically used to achieve movement in the opposite direction. Gearing on the motor is normally such that the spring is unable to return the damper as long as the motor is mechanically engaged. Thus, when it is desired to move the damper in a direction opposite that produced by motor operation, a clutch between the motor and the damper is disengaged to permit the spring to return the damper to a predetermined position. An additional function which may be performed by the spring return apparatus is to position the damper at a predetermined desired position in the event of primary power failure. For example, it may be desirable or required to position a damper which admits outside air to an air conditioning system to a predetermined minimum or closed position in the event of primary power failure. This may be necessary to prevent the admission of unacceptably cold outside air which could freeze water pipes and do other damage, and or to minimize other adverse effects on conditions within the conditioned space. In installations in which a reversible electric motor is employed, the damper may be moved in either direction under the power of the motor. However, even with a reversible motor, spring return apparatus is frequently employed to achieve appropriate positioning of the damper in the event of primary power failure. As previously indicated, the use of a clutch in electric motor return spring systems is necessary to mechanically disengage the motor so as to permit the spring to position the attached damper. A motor mechanism must be especially adapted for use with and to include a return spring and associated clutch. Therefore, in situations in which it is desired to replace an existing non spring return unit with one having a return feature, it is necessary to replace the entire unit. Since it is not always known at the outset whether spring return operation will be required, and since it sometimes becomes necessary after the initial installation to add the return feature, it would be advantageous to be able to use the same motor actuator regardless of whether the return feature might be required, and to provide the return feature, if required, by a simple field addition. An additional characteristic which is inherent in motor actuators with spring return mechanisms is that the motor must be sufficiently powerful in at least one direction to both operate the attached damper and to wind the return spring. This requires a motor which is larger and more expensive than necessary to achieve the basic purpose of positioning the damper. According to the present invention, there is provided a condition responsive control system comprising a reversible electric motor operable in first and second opposite directions in response to electrical energization in order to drive means for variably controlling flow of a fluid affecting a condition of the air within an enclosure and a control circuit responsive to a sensed condition of a fluid medium for selectively supplying electrical power from a primary source to energize said reversible electric motor depending on the sensed condition and characterised by backup power pack means responsive to the absence of power from the primary power source to supply electrical energization to said reversible electric motor to drive said motor only in a first direction. While US A 3 783 363 is concerned with a motor drive in an air conditioning system, it does not teach any use of a backup power supply. While US A 3 808 895 discloses an electrically operated valve suitable for controlling a fluid medium and comprising a mechanical backup function for returning the valve to a predetermined position in response to a loss of power from an electrical supply, this document does not suggest an electrical backup power supply for having the valve driven to the predetermined position by the electric motor itself. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic diagram, partially in block form of the motor drive system of a control responsive control system according to the present invention, Figure 2 is a schematic electrical diagram of a backup power pack suitable for use in the system of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a functional block diagram of an integrated logic circuit used in the backup power pack shown in Figure 2. In the motor drive system illustrated in Figure 1, a modular motor drive assembly 11 includes a motor 12 with associated gearing for producing a rotary output of appropriate speed and torque characteristics for positioning a damper, valve or other similar device. Motor 12 is a reversible motor having three input terminals identified by reference numerals 13, 14 and 15. Terminal 13 is common and is directly energized for either direction of motor operation. A phase shift capacitor 16 is connection between terminals 14 and 15. Motor 12 and capacitor may be collectively referred to as reversible electric motor means. The direction of motor operation is determined by which of terminals 14 and 15 is energized through the capacitor 16. The capacitor introduces a phase lag into the voltage at the terminal to which it supplies current, and thus, characterizes the electrical energization supplied to the motor in one of two ways depending on which terminal is connected to receive current from the capacitor. Normally closed limit switches 17 and 18 establish the limits of rotation in both directions of motor 12. The limits established by switches 17 and 18 represent two stable positions of motor 12. A third position, intermediate the positions established by switches 17 and 18, is established by normally open switch 19 and normally closed switch 20 which are mechanically connected to the output of motor 12 as indicated by dashed lines 21. The purpose of the third position is to provide some minimum operating condition for normal operation of the system in which drive assembly 11 is used. Primary electrical power for operation of the motor drive assembly may be supplied by an electrical utility to the primary winding of a transformer 24. One end of the secondary winding of transformer 24 is connected to terminal 13 of motor 12 by conductors 25 and 26. The other end of the secondary winding of transformer 24 is connected to one of terminals 14 and 15 directly, and to the other of terminals 14 and 15 through capacitor 16 by means of conductors 27 and 28. Which of terminals 14 and 15 is connected directly, and which is connected through capacitor 16 is determined by switching means generally identified by reference numeral 30. As shown in Figure 1, switching means 30 comprises a pair of relays each having two sets of contacts. One relay identified by designator 1K includes a relay coil 31, a normally closed set of contacts 32 and normally open set of contacts 33. A second relay identified by designator 2K, includes a relay coil 34, a normally closed set of contacts 35 and normally open set of contacts 36. For convenience in describing the present embodiment, capacitor 16 and switching means 30 may be collectively referred to as characterization means. Relay coil 31 is connected through a Day Night switch 37 across the secondary winding of transformer 24. In the Night setting, relay coil 31 is not energized. Therefore, relay contacts 32 remain closed and terminals 14 and 15 of motor 12 are energized so as to move the damper driven by motor 12 to its fully closed limiting position. With switch 37 set to its closed or Day setting, relay contacts 33 are closed so as to drive motor 12 to either its open or minimum operating position, depending on whether relay contacts 35 and 36 are respectively closed and opened or vice versa. The state of relay contacts 35 and 36 is determined by a thermostat 40 and an enthalpy control 41, or other suitable condition sensing apparatus. As illustrated, thermostat 40 is a type of thermostat used in two stage air conditioning apparatus. An example of such a thermostat is a Model T872 thermostat commercially marketed by Honeywell Inc. It contains a temperature set point adjustment and temperature sensing element 42, and two sets of normally open contacts 43 and 44. Contacts 43 are connected to enthalpy control 41 which senses the enthalpy of air outside the conditioned space. Enthalpy control 41 includes a normally closed set of contacts 45 connected to relay coil 34. In operation, if thermostat 40 calls for cooling, thus closing contacts 43, and enthalpy control 41 senses that outside air can be advantageously used for cooling purposes, contacts 45 remain closed and energize relay coil 34. This results in closure of contacts 36, thus energizing motor 12 to drive the damper to its full open position. Conversely, if enthalpy control 41 senses that the enthalpy of the outside air is such that the air cannot be advantageously used for cooling, and that mechanical cooling is required, normally open contacts 46 are closed, thus energizing coil 47 of a relay which energizes a first air conditioning stage. If temperature in a conditioned space continues to rise, resulting in closure of thermostat contacts 44, a coil 48 of a relay controlling a second stage of air conditioning is energized. As so far described, in the event of primary power failure, all relay contacts would return to their normal states. Further, since there would be no power to energize motor 12, the damper attached thereto would remain in its position at the time of power failure. Such a condition could have adverse consequences if the damper were positioned to admit outside air and the outside temperature dropped to the point of adversely lowering the temperature within the conditioned space. It is possible to avoid such a situation by providing a spring return and associated clutch between motor 12 and the damper controlled thereby. However, as previously indicated, this requires a special motor module designed and built with a spring return and clutch. The spring return feature cannot be easily added to an existing motor drive unit in the field. Further, if a spring return feature is provided, the motor must be large enough not only to position the damper, but also to wind the return spring. The present backup power pack can be conveniently used with an existing motor drive unit to provide a return to a predetemined position mode for control 12. The backup power pack is electrically connected between conductors 25 and 26 and between conductors 27 and 28, and is shown in block form by dashed lines block 50. The details of backup power pack 50 are shown in schematic form in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, primary electrical energization is supplied between terminals 51 and 53. Presence of primary power is sensed by relay coil 56 of a relay 3K which has a normally closed set of contacts 57 and a normally open set of contact 58. Contacts 58 are connected in series with a first winding 59 of a transformer 60. When primary power is available, relay contacts 58 are closed, thus supplying electrical energization through transformer 60 to circuitry connected to a second winding 61 of the transformer. In this mode of operation, winding 61 is used to supply charging current to a rechargable battery 62. The charging circuitry comprises a centre tap 63 on winding 61 which is connected to the positive terminal of battery 62. The ends of winding 61 are connected through a half wave rectifier bridge comprising diodes 64 and 65 to the negative terminal of battery 62 through a resistor 66. Since energization of relay coil 56 results in opening of relay contacts 57, the remaining circuitry in Figure 2 is electrically disconnected when primary power is available. In the event that the supply of primary power ceases, relay 3K returns to its normal state, thus closing contacts 57 and opening contacts 58. This results in electrical disconnection of transformer winding 59 from the primary power conductors. It also results in the connection of the positive terminal of battery 62 to a bus 70 so as to energize the remaining circuitry in Figure 2. In this mode of operation, a crystal oscillator, comprising a crystal 71 and capacitors 72 and 73, supplies an oscillating signal to an integrated logic circuit identified by reference numeral 74. Integrated circuit 74, whose function will be described in greater detail in connection with Figure 3, supplies a square wave output signal having a repetition rate approximately equal to the frequency of the primary power between its output terminals 3 and 4. This signal is supplied to the bases of a pair of transistors 75 and 76 which, in combination with transistors 77, 80 and resistors 81, 84, form an amplifier. The output of the amplifier appears between the collectors of transistors 79 and 80, and is supplied between intermediate taps 85 and 86 on transformer winding 61. The square wave signals supplied between taps 85 and 86 is rounded somewhat by the inductance of the transformer and coupled through the transformer to winding 59 which is connected across terminals 52 and 54 to supply electrical enerization to motor drive assembly 11. Since the contacts of relays 1K and 2K are in their normal states because of the absence of primary electrical power, motor 12 is driven to a position which fully closes the damper connected to the motor. Thus, in the event of primary power failure, motor 12 and the damper connected thereto are always returned to a predetermined position. The functions provided by integrated circuit 74 may be ascertained from a study of Figure 3. Circuit 74 contains circuitry 90 which, in combination with crystal 71 and capacitors 72 and 73, forms an oscillator which supplied a relatively high frequency square wave signal to a counter 91 and a frequency divider 92. Frequency divider 92 produces an output signal having approximately the same repetition rate as the frequency of the primary power. The output of frequency divider 92 is supplied directly to one input of a first AND gate 93, and through an inverter 94 to one input of a second AND gate 95. The output of counter 91 is connected to the second inputs of AND gates 93 and 95 through an inverter 96. Counter 91 also receives an input from a reset circuit 97 which resets the counter each time power is supplied to integrated circuit 74, indicating primary power failure. Counter 91 supplies an output through inverter 96 to AND gates 93 and 95 for a predetermined period of time determined by the counter. Thus, a square wave signal is provided between the outputs of AND gates 93 and 95 for the period of time determined by counter 91. The period of time established by counter 91 is set slightly longer than the maximum time required for motor 12 to return to a fully closed position. Thus, after motor 12 is provided with backup power for sufficient time to return to a closed position, the signal to the bases of transistor 75 and 76 is discontinued, thus minimizing the current drain on battery 62.
