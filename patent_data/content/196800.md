## Description
SECONDARY LEAD PRODUCTION This invention relates to an apparatus and a method for producing lead from lead sulphate and lead oxide scrap. More particularly, this invention is concerned with the efficient recovery of lead from used automobile lead acid storage batteries. Heretofore, used storage batteries were charged whole, or shredded, into a blast furnace along with coke and chalk. The plates, which consist of lead metal grids covered with a paste of lead oxide PbO plus lead sulphate PESO, were reduced to lead by the coke, also produced was a slag containing FeO, Si02 and CaO. Otherwise the practice was to first shred or comminute the batteries and separate out the rubber or plastic of the casings before processing. By adding water to the small particles produced by comminution, the lighter particles float to the surface and are removed.The heavier particles, lead and lead compounds, are then passed over a rotary vacuum filter to reduce their water content to about 108. By this means a wet battery paste was made as a filter cake and dried. This dried filter cake is subjected to various processes. One process utilizes a long rotary kiln where the pre dried battery paste is mixed with coke, soda ash and iron chips on a belt feeder before being charged into the oil fired kiln where the mixture is heated to 1300 0C. to accomplish ..reduction of the PbO PbSO4 to molten lead. After thePbO is reduced, oxides of arsenic, antimony and other impurities are also reduced to base metals. In another process the lead paste is charged into an oil fired rotary furnace heated to 95roc by the oxidation reaction and the combustion of the fuel oil. Another process utilizes a reverbatory furnace. The prior art methods are capital intensive and the energy costs for pre mixing, drying and reactor heating are high. The product lead contains antimony used in battery grids which must separately removed to obtain soft lead. By comparison, the method and process of this invention is simple, inexpensive and quick. A smaller reactor can be employed, which reduces not only capital expenditure but fuel costs as well. Fume emissions are more easily contained and the premixing and drying steps are avoided. Preferred embodiments of the invention are fluxless and do not require inventories of lime and soda ash. A soft lead may be produced without a separate refining step. The invention consists in a method for producing lead from lead sulphate scrap comprising the steps of a finely comminuting lead acid battery scrap b separating a finely divided lead bearing fraction c continuously charging a refractory lined reaction vessel with said fraction and also with coke or coal as reductant d melting and agitating the charged material with a submerged lance at from 9000c to 11500C and e tapping off the molten lead. The invention achieves its objectives by the vigorous mixing of the finely divided lead bearing fraction, also known as battery paste, with the reducing carbon and the flux or slag by a submerged lance of the type described inU.S. Patent No. 4,251,271. Pre drying of the battery paste is not required nor is it necessary to premix the paste with the carbon reductant. Production of a PbS containing matte is prevented by the presence at all times of lead oxide in the slag. Part of the oxide is present in the lead paste, part is formed as the first product of reduction of PbSO4. Tests were made in a cylindrical refractory lined vessel sized to hold 250 Kg of reactants. Initial testing was performed on lead smelter fume which is similar in chemical and mineralogical composition to battery paste, being Pb 72 and S 6 , but without the carbon or impurities such as antimony, arsenic and tin. Using an SIROSMELT lance, molten lead was produced continuously from lead fume. Following this, two tonnes of battery paste was reduced in one continuous run over ten hours. The effect of varying coke rates and temperatures was investigated. During this trial 60 kg of paste was melted before coke addition started to provide a slag for lance protection.The paste, as wet pellets 10t moisture was fed continaous ly, with lump coke, to the furnace. The oil combustion was set at 95 stoichiometry through the whole trial. SIROSMELT is a trade mark, owned by CSIRO. Based on the coke rate required to maintain a constant slag level in fume smelting the battery paste reduction was started at 8 coke. This was much too high and 4 coke 4.4 on dry basis proved to be the required level.Because PbO is always present in the slag arsenic and antimony oxides are not reduced to metal. Therefore the process produces soft lead i.e., antimony and arsenic below 0.05t directly. Battery paste melts to form a slag from which PbO is reduced to lead, while As and Sb oxides concentrate in the slag layer. The slag is fully reduced periodically to produce a high 5 20 antimony lead masterbatch for alloying. Existing processes do not selectively reduce lead oxide and produce hard lead which must be further treated to remove antimony. In addition, the process is fluxless existing processes add lime and soda ash and it operates at a low temperature down to 9000C . No feed preparation is required. The reduction proceeded satisfactorily between 900 and 1150 0c but a suitable operating range was found to be 0 0 950 C 20 C. Test results were as follows Weight of wet battery paste treated 1 900 kgWeight of lead in battery paste 1 212Product Lead in Slag 80.5 Bullion 930 Fume 160.3 Total lead recovered 1 170.8 97 Oil Consumption 75.9 kg dry tonne paste. Bullion and slag were tapped from the furnace and assayed. Samples of fume were collected from the ventilation baghouse and also analysed. Resultant product recovered averaged according to the following analysis Pb S AS Sb Sn Fe SiO2Lead Bullion 0.01 0.001 0.013 0.001 Slag 55.7 0.1 0.100 1.64 0.06 5.4 8.5 Fume 61.4 6.4 0.424 0.182 0.01 A mass balance worked out as bullion 7781 slag 7 , fume 13 , lost 3 on the basis of the lead in the paste as 1008. Antimony is present in battery paste since an antimonial lead alloy is used in battery grids. Smaller quantities of tin and arsenic are also present in scrap lead. The order of reduction of the elements is Pb, Sb thenSn and As. Thus, while there is unreduced lead oxide present, antimony, arsenic and tin will also concentrate in the oxide slag. The 250 kg pilot plant was operated at 220 kg hr dry paste feed. A volume scale up to a demonstration plant size indicated a feed rate of 9 tph dry paste 10 tph wet and 15 tph is comfortably handled. A commercial plant consists of a vessel 5 m high x 1.8 m ID, lined with 400 mm of chrome magnesite bricks. The lance consists of 150 mm NB mild steel pipe with a 2 m stainless steel tip T316 or 310 . Swirlers are of the low pressure drop type which can operate on air at 100 120 kpa. Either oil or natural gas is used as fuel. The vessel is continuously fed via conveyor belt with battery paste up to 10 moisture and coke 50 mm . Fume recycle is continuous or alternatively fume can be retained and fed back instead of paste. Tapping of lead bullion occurs every 90 minutes leaving unreduced slag in the furnace. Antimony and slag minerals from coke ash concentrate in this slag, and require a periodic slag reduction run. Slag reduction is carried out by addition of excess coke and produces a bullion containing antimony about 208 . The slag from this batch is fully tapped and discarded. Its composition depends on the ash constituents of the coke used and a soda ash flux may be necessary in order to maximise antimony recovery. A typical flowsheet for such a plant is shown in the accompanying drawing, Figure 1. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teaching hereof, the process conditions may be varied to an extent without departing from the inventive concept hereof and such variations are deemed to be within the scope of this disclosure.
