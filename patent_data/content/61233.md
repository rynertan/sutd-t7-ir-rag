# Child resistant adjustable nozzles for fluid dispensers, and dispensers incorporating the same.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a child resistant nozzle for a hand operated sprayer. The nozzle 12 is rotatable relative to a nose bushing 17 at the discharge end of the sprayer into positions of relative adjustment including a liquid flow OFF position and one or more liquid flowing positions. The nozzle 12 and nose bushing 17 have cooperating surfaces in which passages are formed, which passages when brought into register by relative adjustment of the nozzle and discharge end determine the mode of liquid discharge, i.e. SPRAY or STREAM. A locking member 62 is provided on the nose bushing 17 which cooperates, when engaged, with a recess 58 in the rotatable nozzle 12 to prevent sprayer operation by preventing rotation of the nozzle on the nose bushing from said liquid flow OFF position without simultaneously deflecting an arm 60 to disengage the locking member 62 , and rotating the nozzle.
