# Integrated circuit RF amplifier module.

## Abstract
A four terminal integrated circuit high frequency RF am plifier connects to external circuitry via a ground terminal, an RF input terminal, an RF output terminal and a DC biasing ter minal. A two stage amplification architecture is employed a current gain transistor common emitter is cascoded with a subsequent voltage gain transistor common base while yet maintaining RF signal inversion overall from input to output so as to increase stability. A biasing current mirror transistor pro vides biasing current to the current gain transistor. A fourth transistor connected as a forward biased collector base shorted diode between the current mirror biasing transistor and a common external biasing terminal supplies bias current to the current mirror biasing transistor while simultaneously minimizing voltage swings across the current gain transistor. The amplifier module has very low input capacitance which does not change appreciably with changes in load impedance, and operates with great stability under a wide range of differ ent input and output conditions and RF frequencies. Because of its relative simplicity and compactness, the amplifier can be used to great advantage as an IC building block in a variety of different applications.
