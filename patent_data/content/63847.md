# Method of saturating a gas with the vapour of a liquid.

## Abstract
An arrangement for saturating a gas with the vapour of a liquid is formed by two chambers. In the first chamber the gas is passed through the liquid which has a higher temperature than the temperature at which the gas must ultimately have been saturated on leaving the arrangement. Thereafter, the gas is passed into a second chamber. The liquid in said chamber has the temperature at which the gas must be saturated.
