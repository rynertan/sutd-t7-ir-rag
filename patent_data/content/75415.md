# ENDOSCOPES PROVIDED WITH PERSPECTIVE ILLUMINATION ATTACHMENTS

## Abstract
A perspective viewing endoscope 11 having a perspec tive illumination attachment fitted to produce shades corre sponding to concavo convex surface details of an object with in a body cavity, so that the object having the concavo convex surface details can be seen to be three dimensional features defined by shading. In an endoscope wherein illuminating light is projected in to a body cavity to observe or photograph the interior of the body cavity by the reflected light if the interior of the body cavi ty is illuminated from only one direction by substantially parallel illuminating light beams projected from a light projecting sur face, the reflected light received at an observation window po sitioned near the illuminating light projecting surface prevents any shading corresponding to concavo convex surface fea tures of the object being formed by the illuminating light beams, and as shading cannot be observed, the image ap pears very flat. In the present invention, illuminating light is projected di rectly from a surface 17 of an insertion sheath 13 of the en doscope 11 and also reflected by an inclined surface 24 to provide illuminating light beams dispersed over a predeter mined angle and not arranged in parallel formation, whereby shading of the image corresponding to concavo convex sur face details of an object within a body cavity can be produced, and the object within the body cavity can be studied for three dimensional features by examination of the shading.
