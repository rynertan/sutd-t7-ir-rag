# DEVICE TO COMBAT DRIBBLING

## Abstract
A device for teaching a patient to keep his lips closed, to combat dribbling, has a sensor electrode 12, 22, 46 for insertion between the lips, and an electrical detector G1 and indicator 30 to indicate cessation of contact with at least one lip. The patient is thus reminded to keep his lips closed. In one form, there is a secondary electrode 26 attached to a remote part of the patient s body, the detector detecting when an electrical circuit through the body is broken by the sensor electrode falling from the lips. In another form, the sensor electrode 46 is upwardly hooked 50 to contact the upper lip, and the detector detects absence of electrical contact between sensor electrode and a frame 32 hooked behind the lower lip.
