## Abstract
A method of producing a semiconductor device comprising a bipolar transistor and a Schottky barrier diode e.g., an SBD transistor , comprises the steps of selectively etching an insulat ing layer 27 formed on an N type silicon epitaxial layer 23 so as to form an emitter electrode contact window 29c forming a polycrystalline silicon layer 30 on the exposed portion of a P type base region 25 in the window 29c introducing N type impurities into the P type base region 25 through the polycrys talline silicon layer 30 in the window 29c after the impurity introducing step, selectively etching the insulating layer 27 so as to form a base electrode contact window 29b and a contact window 29d for the electrode of the SBD carrying out heat treatment for redistribution of the introduced impurities so as to form an emitter region 35 and forming an emitter electrode 36c on the polycrystalline silicon layer 30 and the electrode 36d of the SBD directly on the silicon epitaxial layer 23 .
