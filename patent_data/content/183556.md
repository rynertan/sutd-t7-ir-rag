## Description
This invention relates to a new immunopotentiating agent comprising a chitin oligomer or a chitosan oligomer as the active ingredient which is useful as the host defense stimulator to enhance the immune response in living animals, including man. This invention also relates to a method for stimulating the immune response. Hithertofore, various known antibiotics and antibacterial or antifungal chemical compounds have been used as the agents for controlling or treating therapeutically bacterial or fungal infections. However, some of the known antibiotics and antibacterial chemical compounds can often give side effects in the patients treated during the therapeutic treatment of bacterial infections due to occurrence of mutation of the microbial strains which are resistant to the antibiotics and or the antibacterial chemical compounds as administered. In these circumstances, a lasting demand for a new antibacterial or antifungal agent exists. Besides, it is known that such patients having lower immune function than their normal level of the immune function, for example, the tumor bearing patients and such patients whose immune response has been reduced to an abnormally reduced level by preliminary administration of an immunosuppressive agent before surgical operations for the purpose of facilitating the transplantation of internal organs, are highly susceptible to the opportunistic infection by bacteria and fungi, so that a demand for such a new immunopotentiating agent effective to control and or treat therapeutically the bacterial and fungal infections is also seen. We, the present inventors, recently have provided such a series of new agents for therapeutic control and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections, which comprise chitin or chitosan as the active ingredients exhibiting the immunopotentiating activities to meet the above mentioned demands Japanese patent application first publication Kokai Sho 59 27827, laid open on 14th February, 1984 . Chitin and chitosan are readily available as they occur in large quantities in nature, for instance, in the cell walls of microorganisms and in the outer shells of insects, and On the other hand, several agents for therapeutic treatment of malignant tumors which comprise as the active ingredient a polysaccharide or polysaccharides isolated from the cells of microorganisms or from the metabolic products of microorganisms have been proposed in recent years. For example, lentinan, namely such a polysaccharide isolated from the fruit body of a mushroom called shiitake The above mentioned therapeutic agents comprising chitin or chitosan as the active ingredient have remarkable therapeutic activities for control and treatment of the bacterial and fungal infections and for the treatment of tumors. However, both chitin and chitosan are difficult to be formulated into injectable aqueous solutions for intravenous administration because chitin and chitosan are water insoluble polymers, and hence they are not yet entirely satisfactory in practice to be used in the therapeutic treatment of bacterial and fungal infections and also in the therapeutic treatment of tumors in clinic. We have made further researches in an attempt to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages of the chitin and chitosan when used as the antibacterial and antifungal agents and as the antitumor agent. US A 391413 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising partially depolymerized chitin, eg chitobiose, chitotriose which improves the healing of wounds, especially in patients undergoing cortisone treatment. This pharmaceutical composition can take the form of an injectable solution since chitobiose and chitotriose are water soluble chitin oligomers. We have now found unexpectably that several water soluble chitin oligomers otherwise termed as the N acetyl chito oligosaccharides which are known as the hydrolysis products of chitin, and several water soluble chitosan oligomers otherwise termed as the chito oligosaccharides which are also known as the hydrolysis products of chitosan, possess the immunopotentiating activities to stimulate and enhance the immune response in host animals, and are also able to exhibit the inhibitory effects against the infections of bacteria and fungi, as well as the antitumor activity in the same host animals. The water soluble chitin oligomers of which the immunopotentiating activities have now been discovered by us are represented by the following general formula Ia The water soluble chitosan oligomers of which the immunopotentiating activities have now been discovered by us are represented by the following general formula Ib Based on our above findings, we have accomplished this invention. Production and some properties of the chitin oligomers are described in the Journal of Chemical Society C , According to the present invention, therefore, there is provided the use of penta N acetylchitopentaose, hexa N acetyl chitohexaose, hepta N acetyl chitoheptaose, chitopentaose, chitohexaose or chitoheptaose in the manufacture of an immunopotentiating agent for enhancing the immune response against bacterial and fungal infections and against the growth of tumours. The immunopotentiating agent of this invention may be in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more of said immunopotentiating chitin oligomers and chitosan oligomers as the active ingredient in an immuno potentiating effective amount thereof in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or solid carrier which is known and usually employed in the formulation of medicines, such as physiological saline, starch and talc. Amongst the above mentioned particular examples of the immunopotentiating chitin oligomers and chitosan oligomers, hexa N acetyl chitohexaose is most preferred because of its highest effect. The immunopotentiating agent of this invention may advantageously be formulated into an injectable aqueous solution of its active ingredient compound in a conventional manner, utilizing the high water solublity of the chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer employed as the active ingredient. The injectable aqueous solution so prepared may be administered not only intravenously but also subcutaneously, intracutaneously, intramuscularly or intraperitoneally. The immunopotentiating agent of this invention may also be formulated into tablets or powders for oral administration by admixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable known solid carrier. The injectable aqueous solution so prepared may contain 0.1 to 10 by weight of the chitin oligomer of the formula Ia or the chitosan oligomer of the formula Ib . The immunopotentiating agent of this invention in the form of tablets or powders may contain 10 to 30 by weight of the chitin oligomer of the formula Ia or the chitosan oligomer of the formula Ib . We have now experimentally confirmed that the chitin oligomers of the formula Ia and the chitosan oligomers of the formula Ib shown hereinbefore, exhibit such remarkable effects of activating the active oxygen generating capacity and the chemotactic activity of phagocytes in mice when they are intraperitoneally administered to the mice. Thus, we have firstly observed that when the oligomers of the formula Ia and Ib , are administered intraperitoneally to mice which had been lethally infected with true fungi According to an embodiment of the first aspect of this invention, therefore, there is provided an immunopotentiating agent which is used for enhancing the immune response against the bacterial and fungal infections, and which comprises an effective amount of the chitin oligomer of the formula Ia or chitosan oligomer of the formula Ib , in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for the active ingredient. For this antibacterial and antifungal purpose, the agent of this invention is effective especially to control the infection with Moreover, we have experimentally found that all the particular 6 compounds as included by the chitin oligomers of the formula Ia and by the chitosan oligomers of the formula Ib are active to promote the cellular immunity, i.e., the cell mediated immunity as well as humoral immunity in mice and other living animals, including man, and are thus active to stimulate and enhance the immune response in host animals inhibitorily to the growth of tumors. It has also been revealed that the immunopotentiating agent of this invention is effective as an antitumor agent for inhibiting the growth of tumors, including various mouse cancer cells such as Sarcoma 180, Ehrlich carcinoma, MM 46 and Meth A. According to a further embodiment of the first aspect invention, therefore, there is provided an immunopotentiating agent which is used for enhancing the immune response against the growth of tumors, and which comprises an effective amount of a chitin oligomer of the formula Ia or a chitosan oligomer of the formula Ib , in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. For the purpose of cancer immunotherapy, the active ingredient compound of the formula Ia or Ib may be administered at the effective dosages from 1 to 500 mg kg, preferably from 10 to 150 mg kg per day. The immunopotentiating agent of this invention, when used as the antitumor agent, is advantageous in that the chitin oligomers of the formula Ia or the chitosan oligomers of the formula Ib used as the active ingredient are very much safe to human, because they are substantially not toxic to human and do not exhibit any side effects in practice when administered to human that the water soluble chitin oligomers and chitosan oligomers are readily formulatable into injectable aqueous solution and hence easily administrable to human, that the development of their therapeutic effects after the administration of the agent of this invention is fast that the agent of this invention may be formulated into the intravenously injectable preparation into which the previously known anti tumor agents comprising the high molecular polysaccharides, including those of the chitin and chitosan as the active ingredient are practically impossible to be formulated and that the active oligomer compounds to be used in the agent of this invention may readily be isolated and purified to a pure product owing to their relatively simple chemical structure and their low molecular weights. Furthermore, we have found that the chitin oligomers of the formula Ia or the chitosan oligomers of the formula Ib are also effective as adjuvants when administered together with an antigen given as a vaccine, in the sense that the effects of the immunity induced by the vaccine antigen as administered into a host animal can be enhanced by concurrent administration of the chitin oligomers of the formula Ia or the chitosan oligomers of the formula Ib . Whether the chitin oligomers of the formula Ia or the chitosan oligomers of the formula Ib are able to serve either as the adjuvant or as the immunopotentiating agent, it may be demonstrated,as known to the expert, by showing that intraperitoneal injection of the chitin oligomers or the chitosan oligomers to the mice having been immunized with intravenously injected sheep red blood cells SRBC as antigen can increase the number of the antibody forming cells in spleen cells of the treated mice in term of the number of the plaque forming cells as enumerated by Jerne s hemolytic plaque assay see N.K. Jerne, A.A. Nordin and C.Henrry The agar plaque technique for recognizing antibody producing cells. Cell bound Antibodies. ed. B.Amos and H.Koprowski pp. 109 122, Wister Institute Press. Philadelphia, 1963 . It was also demonstrated that the chitin oligomers or the chitosan oligomers can enhance the cellular immunity in mice as estimated by delayed type hypersensitivity D.T.H. to SRBC according to the method of Lagrange et al see P.H. Lagrange, G.B. Mackaness and T.E. Miles J. Exp. Med. According to the second aspect of this invention, there is provided a use in the manufacture of an immunopotentiating agent of a water soluble chitin oligomer selected from penta N acetyl chitopentaose hexa N acetyl chitohexaose and hepta N acetyl chitoheptaose, or of a water soluble chitosan oligomer selected from chitopentaose, chitohexaose and chitoheptaose. Moreover, it is known that some of the therapeutic agents such as antibiotics, medicinal drugs, antitumor drugs and hormones may be encapsuled in the liposomes which are unilamellar or multilamellar phospholipid vesicles, and that the liposomes serve as the carrier vesicles for the therapeutic agent entrapped therein and also give rise to an improved uptake of the therapeutic agent by the target organs or tissues in vivo after the administration see, for example, an article titled New Aspects of Liposomes in the Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, An available process for preparing the liposomes containing the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer entrapped therein may comprises, for instance, the steps of placing in a vessel a solution of the liposome film forming phospholipid material in an organic solvent such as chloroform and ethanol, evaporating in vacuo entirely or partially the organic solvent from the phospholipid solution in said vessel to produce solid thin films of the phospholipid material on the inner wall surface of the vessel, subsequently charging into the vessel a solution of the active chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer in water, physiological saline, buffered phosphate solution, buffered tris aminomethane solution or in an aqueous solution of glucose or sorbitol, and agitating the whole contents in the vessel mechanically or under ultrasonic actions, until the liquid suspension of the liposomes is formed. Or, the liposome formulations may also be produced, for example, by mixing an aqueous solution of the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer with a solution of the liposome film forming phospholipid material in a water immiscible organic solvent such as diethylether and diisopropylether, emulsifying the resultant liquid mixture by mechanical agitation or under ultrasonic actions, and then evaporating in vacuo entirely or partially the organic solvent from the resultant emulsion so that the suspension of the liposomes is formed. The liposomes present in the suspension so obtained may then be purified by isolating the particles of the liposomes from the liquid medium of said suspension by centrifugation, re dispersing the isolated particulate liposomes into an aqueous liquid medium in which the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer is soluble, and then separating the liposome particles centrifugally from the dispersion so obtained. The first prepared suspension of the liposomes may also be passed through a column of a gel filtration agent such as Sephadex for the purification purpose. The liposomes containing the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer so purified may be handled as such in the form of liquid suspension mentioned above. The particulate liposomes as isolated may be redispersed in an appropriate liquid medium for ready use. Alternatively, the suspension of the liposomes may be freeze dried to separate the particles of the liposomes which are then again dispersed in an appropriate liquid medium. In any way, the liposomes containing the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer may be formulated as an intravenously or intraperitoneally injectable preparation in the form of a dispersion in an appropriate aqueous liquid medium. The chitin oligomer of the formula Ia or the chitosan oligomer of the formula Ib as the liposome formulation may be administered at a dosage of said oligomer of 1 mg kg to 500 mg kg, preferably of 10 mg kg to 150 mg kg per day, when it is given for the antitumor treatment by the immunopotentiation. While, the chitin oligomer of the formula Ia or the chitosan oligomer of the formula Ib as the liposome formulation may be administered as a dosage of said oligomer of 1 mg kg to 100 mg kg per day, when it is given for the purpose of controlling the bacterial and fungal infections through the immunopotentiating activities of the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer. This invention in now illustrated with reference to the following Examples. This Example illustrates the manufacture of an injectable solution of penta N acetyl chitopentaose. Penta N acetyl chitopentaose 10 g was dissolved in an appropriate volume of a physiological saline as prepared for the injection use, to a total volume of 1000 ml. The resulting solution was formulated into the injectable solution preparation according to the standard method of preparing the injectable formulations as stipulated in the 10th Japanese Pharmacopoeia. This Example illustrates the manufacture of an injectable solution of hexa N acetyl chitohexaose. Hexa N acetyl chitohexaose 10 g was dissolved in an appropriate volume of a physiological saline as prepared for the injection use, to a total volume of 1000 ml. The resulting solution was formulated into the injectable solution preparation in the same manner as in Example 1. This Example illustrated the manufacture of an injectable solution of chitohexaose. Chitohexaose 10 g was dissolved in an appropriate volume of a physiological saline as prepared for the injection use, to a total volume of 1000 ml. The resulting solution was formulated into the injectable solution preparation in the same manner as in Example 1. This Example demonstrates that, penta N acetyl chitopentaose, and hexa N acetyl chitohexaose exhibit the activities of promoting the active oxygen producing capacity of peritoneal macrophages existing in the peritoneal exudate cells of mice, indicating that the compounds under test can enhance the phagocytic activities of the macrophages as one function of the immunopotentiating activities of the tested compounds. An injectable solution of penta N acetyl chitopentaose or hexa N acetyl chitohexaose as prepared similarly to the Examples 1 to 3 above was intraperitoneally injected into BALB C mice male, 4 to 6 weeks aged, 8 mice per group at a dosage of the active ingredient of 50 mg kg. At the times of 3, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the injection, the peritoneal cavities of the treated mice were washed with Hanks buffered solution, the washings were combined together and the peritoneal exudate cells were separated therefrom. The peritoneal exudate cells so collected were suspended in a fresh Hanks buffered solution to a concentration of 1 x 10⁶ cells per ml. The resulting suspension of the peritoneal exudate cells was mixed with 5 mmol glucose and 50 µℓ of a solution of 2 mg ml of luminol in dimethylsulfoxide, and the mixture obtained was incubated for 10 minutes at 37 C. The chemiluminescence response in the incubated mixture was determined over 10 minutes by means of a chemiluminescence measuring apparatus, Biolumat LB9500 Berthold Co., West Germany . It was assumed that the intensity cpm in the chemiluminescence response as determined was substantially proportional to the intensity in the active oxygen generating capacity and hence the intensity in the phagocytic activities of the macrophages of the peritoneal exudate cells which would be promoted by the administration of the water soluble chitin oligomer under test, so that the determination of the intensity in the chemiluminescence response of said incubated mixture would indicate such enhanced phagocytic activities of the macrophages of the peritoneal exudate cells as induced by the chitin oligomer. The above experiments were carried out in the same manner as above, using the physiological saline containing no test compound and also using the chitin, the parent polysaccharide. The results of test in term of an average value standard deviation are summarized in Table 1. In Table 1, the double asterisked term This Example demonstrates that the candidacidal activity of the peritoneal exudate cells of the mice intra peritoneally administered with the chitin oligomers is enhanced. This Example also indicates that the chitin oligomers can promote the candida killing activities of the macrophages in the peritoneal exudate cells from the treated mice. An injectable solution as prepared similarly to the Examples 1 3 containing a chitin oligomer indicated in Table 2 was intraperitoneally administered to BALB C mice male, 4 to 6 weeks aged, 8 mice per group at a dosage of the active ingredient of 50 mg kg. At the times of 3, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the injection of the tested chitin oligomer, the peritoneal cavities of the treated mice were washed with Hanks buffered solution, then the washings were combined together and the peritoneal exudate cells were collected therefrom by centrifugation. The peritoneal exudate cells were suspended in a fresh Hanks buffered solution to a concentration of 1 x 10⁶ cells per ml. The cell suspension obtained was placed into a 96 well microplate, into which was then added a normal mouse serum to a concentration of 10 by weight and then added 200 living cells of The above experiments were carried out in the same manner as above, using the physiological saline containing no test compound, and also using the chitin as the reference material. The results of test in term of an average value standard deviation are summarized in Table 2. This Example demonstrates that the administration of the water soluble chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer according to this invention can prolong the life span of mice lethally infected with a gram positive bacterium, An injectable solution as prepared similarly to the Examples 1 3 containing a chitin oligomer or a chitosan oligomer indicated in Table 3 was intraperitoneally injected into specific pathogen free SPF ddY mice male, 5 weeks aged, 8 mice per group at a dosage of the active ingredient of 50 mg kg per day at the times of 5, 3 and 1 days before the intraperitoneal inoculation of such a culture of the gram positive bacteria as specified below. After the immunopotentiating administration of the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer, the treated mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with 0.1 ml of the cell suspension containing 6 x 10⁷ cells of These experiments were carried out in the same manner as above, using the mice not treated with the chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer but receiving the inoculation of the bacterium for the control test , and also using the mice treated with the chitin or chitosan and receiving the inoculation of bacterium for the comparison purpose. The results of test are shown in Table 3. This Example demonstrates that the administration of the water soluble chitin oligomer according to this invention can prolong the life span of mice lethally infected with a gram negative bacterium, An injectable solution as prepared similarly to the Examples 1 3 containing a chitin oligomer indicated in Table 4 was intraperitoneally injected into specific pathogen free SPF ddY mice male, 5 weeks aged, 8 mice per group at a dosage of the active ingredient of 50 mg kg per day at the times of 3, 2 and 1 days before the intravenous inoculation of such a culture of the gram negative bacteria as specified below. After the immunopotentiating administration of the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer, the treated mice were intravenously inoculated with 0.1 ml of the cell suspension containing 1.2 x 10⁷ cells of The experiments were carried out in the same manner as above, using the mice not treated with the chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer but receiving the inoculation of the bacterium for the control test , and also using the mice treated with the chitin and receiving the inoculation of the bacterium for the comparison purpose. The results of test are shown in Table 4. This Example demonstrates the activity of the chitin oligomer to enhance the humoral antibody response. An injectable solution as prepared similarly to the Examples 1 3 containing the chitin oligomer indicated in Table 5 was intravenously injected into the tail of BALB C mice male, 4 6 weeks aged, 6 mice per group at a dosage of the active ingredient of 100 mg kg once a day for the consecutive 3 days, totally 3 times. One day later, the treated mice were immunized with 1 x 10⁶ sheep red blood cells SRBC as the antigen by intravenous injection. Four days later, the spleens were surgically removed from the mice under test, and the number of the antibody forming cells per spleen was evaluated by the Jerne s hemolytic plaque assay method in term of the numer of the plaque forming cells, for the purpose of estimating the activity of the test compound to enhance the antibody formation in spleen. This experiment was carried out in the same manner as above, using the physiological saline merely without the test compound. The results of test expressed in term of an average value standard deviation are summarized in Table 5. This Example demonstrates that the chitin oligomer can enhance the cellular immunity in mice. An injectable solution as prepared similarly to the Examples 1 3 containing the chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer indicated in Table 6 was intraperitoneally administered into BALB C mice male, 4 6 weeks aged, 6 mice per group at a dosage of the active ingredient of 100 mg kg once a day for the consecutive 3 days, totally 3 times. One day later, the treated mice were immunized with 1 x 10⁸ sheep red blood cells SRBC as the antigen by injection of SRBC into the hind footpad. Four days later, the mice under test were administered again with SRBC by injection of 1 x 10⁸ SRBC into the another hind footpad to estimate the response of the delayed type hypersensitivity D.T.H. . An increased thickness of footpad was evaluated to assess the activity of the tested compound to enhance the cell mediated cellular immunity. This experiment was carried out in the same manner as above, but using the physiological saline without the test compound and also using the chitin for the positive control. The results of test are shown in Table 6. This Example demonstrates that the activity of the chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer is growth inhibitory to Sarcoma 180 solid tumor in mice. ddY Mice male, SPP, 4 6 weeks aged, 5 mice per group were inoculated with Sarcoma 180 tumor cells 1 x 10⁶ per mouse subcutaneously into the right groin of the mice. After seventh day as of the inoculation of the tumor cells, an injectable solution as prepared similarly to the Examples 1 3 containing the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer indicated in Table 7 was intravenously injected into the tumor bearing mice at a dosage of the active ingredient of 100 mg kg once a day at an interval of one day during the consecutive 5 days, totally 3 times. After 23 days as of the inoculation of the tumor cells, the weight of the tumor was determined and the inhibition ratio to the tumor growth was evaluated, as compared with the results of the control test. The control test was conducted using the mice which received the inoculation of the tumor cells and then received merely the injection of physiological saline without the test compound. The results of test are shown in Table 7. This Example also demonstrates that the activity of the chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer is growth inhibitory to Sarcoma 180 solid tumor. ddY Mice male, SPF, 4 6 weeks aged, 7 mice per group were inoculated with Sarcoma 180 tumor cells 1 x 10⁶ per mouse subcutaneously into the right groin of the mice. After seventh day the inoculation of the tumor cells, an injectable solution as prepared similarly to the Examples 1 3 containing the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer indicated in Table 8 was intravenously injected into the tumor bearing mice at a dosage of the active ingredient of 100 mg kg once a day at an interval of one day between the administrations of the test compound during the consecutive 9 days, totally 5 times of the administration. After 23 days the inoculation of the tumor cells, the weight of the tumor was determined and the inhibition ratio to the tumor growth was evaluated, as compared with the results of the control test. The control test was conducted using the mice which received the inoculation of the tumor cells and then received merely the injection of physiological saline without the test compound. The results of test are summarized in Table 8. This Example also demonstrates that the activity of the chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer is growth inhibitory to MM 46 solid tumor. C3H He Mice male, SPF, 4 6 weeks aged, 7 mice per group were inoculated with MM 46 tumor cells 1 x 10⁶ per mouse subcutaneously into the right groin of the mice. After seventh day the inoculation of the tumor cells, an injectable solution as prepared similarly to the Examples 1 3 containing the chitin oligomer or the chitosan oligomer indicated in Table 9 was intravenously injected into the tumor bearing mice at a dosage of the active ingredient of 100 mg kg once a day but at an interval of one day between the administrations of the test compound during the consecutive 9 days, totally 5 times of the administration. After 23 days the inoculation of the tumor cells, the weight of the tumor was determined and the inhibition ratio to the tumor growth was evaluated, as compared with the results of the control test. The control test was conducted using the mice which received the inoculation of the tumor cells and then received merely the injection of physiological saline without the test compound. The results of test are summarized in Table 9. This Example also demonstrates the activity of the chitin oligomer inhibitory to the growth of Meth A tumor. BALB C Mice male, SPF, 4 6 weeks aged, 8 mice per group were inoculated with Meth A tumor cells 1 x 10⁶ per mouse subcutaneously into the right groin of the mice. After 14th day the inoculation of the tumor cells, an injectable solution as prepared similarly to the Examples 1 3 containing the chitin oligomer indicated in Table 10 was intravenously injected into the tumor bearing mice at a dosage of the active ingredient of 100 mg kg. After 23 days the inoculation of the tumor cells, the weight of the tumor was determined and the inhibition ratio to the tumor growth was evaluated, as compared with the results of the control test. The control test was conducted using the mice which received the inoculation of the tumor cells and then received merely the injection of physiological saline without the test compound. The results of test are summarized in Table 10. This Example illustrates the production of the liposome preparation containing hexa N acetyl chitohexaose as one of the chitin oligomers available according to this invention. A solution of 14 mg 17.5 µmol of egg yolk lecithine phosphatidylcholine , 6 mg 7.5 µmol of phosphatidylserine and 15 mg 15 µmol of cholesterol in 5 ml of chloroform was placed together with one drop of tocopherol into a round bottomed flask of 50 ml capacity. The flask with its contents was heated on an evaporator to distill off entirely the chloroform from said solution under reduced pressure. A small volume of chloroform was added into the flask and the residue remaining in the flask was dissolved in the chloroform added. The resulting solution was again distilled under well stirring by an electro magnetic agitator, so that thin film mainly comprising the lecithine was formed on and over the inner wall surface of the flask, into which was then placed an aqueous solution of 20 mg of hexa N acetyl chitohexaose dissolved in 2 ml of a phosphate buffer solution at such a rate that the total quantity of the lipids as charged was amounting to 20 µ mol per ml of the aqueous solution of the chitin oligomer. The content in the flask was further stirred by the electro magnetic agitator, until there was formed a white colored suspension of the liposomes. When the liposomes presented in said suspension were observed under electron microscope, it was found that they were in the form of the multilamellar vesicles of about 1 to 10 µ in diameter and that the aqueous solution of hexa N acetyl chitohexaose was entrapped within the respective liposome vesicles. The above mentioned phosphate buffer solution employed had been prepared by dissolving 0.8 g of sodium chloride, 0.2 g of potassium chloride, 0.1 g of calcium chloride, 0.1 g of magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 2.9 g of disodium hydrogen phosphate 12 hydrate and 0.2 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate in distilled water to a total volume of 1000 ml. This Example demonstrates an increased activity of the liposomes containing hexa N acetyl chitohexaose to inhibit the growth of Sarcome 180 tumor. ddY Mice male SPF, 4 weeks aged, 6 mice per group were inoculated with Sarcoma 180 tumor cells 5 x 10⁶ per mouse subcutaneously into the right groin of the mice. After 7th day the inoculation of the tumor cells, the liposome suspension as prepared in the Example 14 of such quantity which was required to give the dosage of the active ingredient indicated in Table 11 was intravenously injected into the tail of the tumor bearing mice. After 30 days from the inoculation of the tumor cells, the weight of the tumor was determined and the rate in of the inhibition to the tumor growth was evaluated, as compared with the results of the control test. The control test was conducted in such a way that the mice having received the inoculation of the tumor cells were treated with the aforesaid phosphate buffer solution only in place of the suspension of the liposomes containing hexa N acetyl chitohexaose and the weight of the tumor was then measured Control test No. 2 . The above experiment was repeated but treating the tumor bearing mice with a mere aqueous solution of hexa N acetyl chitohexaose for comparison or treating the tumor bearing mice with the suspension of liposomes containing therein no hexa N acetyl chitohexaose but containing merely the phosphate buffer solution entrapped therein for control test No. 1 . The results of test are summarized in Table 11.
