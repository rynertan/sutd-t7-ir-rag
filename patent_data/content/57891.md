## Description
The present invention relates to an ethylene α olefin copolymer composition. More particularly, the present invention relates to ethylene α olefin copolymer compositions excellent in processability, impact strength, tensile strength, environmental stress cracking resistance, low temperature resistance, creep characteristics, tear strength, transparency, heat sealing characteristics and chemical characteristics such as chemicals resistance. Being excellent in melt rheology characteristics as well as in physical and chemical properties, low density polyethylenes manufactured by the high pressure method hereinafter referred to as high pressure polyethylene have been used for various uses such as films, sheets, pipes, blow bottles, injection molded products, coating materials for steel pipes and foam molded materials. As mentioned above, high pressure polyethylenes are excellent in melt rheology characteristics, and therefore, they are excellent in processability. When used for extrusion processing or injection molding, their production efficiency is high, resulting in relatively low electricity consumption. In blown film processing, the above polyethylenes give good bubble stability. In cast film processing and extrusion lamination processing, there is only slight neck in . In blow molding, these polyethylenes give good parison stability. However, when they are processed into molded products, their mechanical strengths, such as tensile strength and impact strength, are relatively low and accordingly these products can not be used in thin forms. High pressure polyethylenes have various other problems. They are used in many fields as films. Films of high pressure polyethylenes are required to have the following properties in recent, highly developed automatic packaging systems. To improve these defects, some attempts have been made. However, the quality is still not at a satisfactory level. For improvement of these defects, the following polymerization methods have been adopted. The former method still has many problems such as a reduction of tear strength, rigidity and heat resistance of films, b occurrence of corrosion of extruder and smell in processing due to liberation of acetic acid and c occurrence of blocking due to sticky film surface and cold flow. The latter method has problems of reduction of thermal stability and weather resistance and of high cost. Also for improvement of the defects of high pressure polyethylenes, there were made proposals in which a high pressure polyethylene is mixed with another α olefin polymer such as high density polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene, or a rubber. However, an improvement in one defect causes another problem and no satisfactory answer has been attained. As resins which have low densities about equal to those of high pressure polyethylenes, there are known resins which are prepared by co polymerizing ethylene and an α olefin under a medium to low pressure using a transition metal catalyst. Hereinafter, such are abbreviated as ethylene α olefin copolymers . The copolymers produced with a vanadium catalyst are low in degree of crystallization, and have problems in heat resistance, weather resistance and mechanical strengths. The ethylene α olefin copolymers produced under normal polymerization conditions with a titanium catalyst, having generally narrow molecular weight distributions narrower than those of high pressure polyethylenes , are relatively excellent in mechanical strengths but poor in melt rheology characteristics and have many problems in processing. In blown film processing, a large quantity of electricity is needed, output is reduced or bubble stability is lost. In high speed processing, shark skin appears on film surfaces, thereby decreasing product values. Also in blow molding, parison stability is lost, or surfaces of molded products turn to shark skin and product values are lost. In injection molding, processing temperatures need to be largely raised because of poorer flow property under high pressures as compared with high pressure polyethylenes, which requires more heat energy and moreover causes resin deterioration. Trials have been made in recent years for solving these problems by improving extruders, screws and dies. These approaches require a large amount of expenditures and moreover techniques have not been fully developed. Further, various other problems such as the following have been encountered Low density ethylene α olefin copolymers are difficult to obtain under normal polymerization conditions using a chromium catalyst, because copolymerizability between ethylene and α olefin is generally lower with chromium catalysts than with titanium catalyst. When a chromium titanium catalyst is used in order to overcome this problem, ethylene α ethylene copolymers obtained have wider molecular weight distributions than copolymers produced with a titanium catalyst and have slightly improved processability. However, their mechanical strengths largely worsen and their physical properties are not much different from those of high pressure polyethylenes and these copolymers provide film sheets and bottles inferior in transparency. For attempting to improve the transparency of these copolymers, when the quantity of an α olefin is largely increased in polymerization and the density of the copolymer obtained is reduced, only a sticky copolymer having much deteriorated mechanical strengths is produced. According to the knowledge of the present inventors, ethylene α olefin copolymers polymerized under a medium to low pressure using a transition metal catalyst, have non uniform component distributions. Namely in these copolymers, the number of short chain branching per 1000 carbon atoms excluding methyl groups at the ends hereinafter referred to as S.C.B. for brevity varies depending upon molecular weight, and generally lower molecular weight components have larger S.C.B. and higher molecular weight components have smaller S.C.B. This phenomenon is considered to be due to that α olefins tend to act as a chain transfer agent or act even to active sites of catalyst to which molecular weight regulators such as hydrogen tend to act. cf. Reference Example 1 . Because of the above phenomenon, ethylene α olefin copolymers polymerized with the α olefin concentration increased with an aim to reduce to a large extent the density of copolymers produced, only give such products as those having increased S.C.B. in their lower molecular weight components, thereby having increased solubility in solvents and poor mechanical strengths and causing surface stickiness. This tendency is particularly remarkable in those ethylene α olefin copolymers which are polymerized with a catalyst giving wider molecular weight distributions. One of the reasons for poor mechanical strengths of ethylene α olefin copolymers having wide molecular weight distributions will be explained by the above fact. As described above, ethylene α olefin copolymers having densities about equal to those of high pressure polyethylenes and synthesized under a medium to low pressure with a transision metal catalyst, can not satisfy all of processability, mechanical strengths and transparency. For instance, lowering of molecular weight for improvement of processability results in large reduction in mechanical strengths and disappearance of said copolymer characteristics. Broadening of molecular weight distribution leads to large reduction in mechanical strengths as well cf. Reference Example 2 , and moreover transparency worsens and surfaces of molded products get sticky. Thus, both of processability and physical properties are not met together yet, and any low density ethylene α olefin copolymer excellent in processability and mechanical strengths have not yet been provided. As described above, high pressure polyethylenes are excellent in rheology characteristics and processability but relatively poor in mechanical strengths. On the other hand, ethylene α olefin copolymers polymerized under a medium to low pressure with a transition metal catalyst and having density about equal to those of high pressure polyethylenes, have excellent mechanical strengths due to their narrower molecular weight distributions but are poor in processability. These property differences are considered to originate from molecular structures of polymers. High pressure polyethylenes are obtained from radical polymerization under a pressure of about 1500 to 4000 bar at a temperature of about 150 to 350 C in an autoclave or a tubular reactor. Their molecular structures are very complicated and, in spite of being homopolymers of ethylene, have short chain branches which are alkyl groups of 1 to 6 carbon atoms. These short chain branches affect crystallinities and therefore densities of polymers. The distribution of short chain branching of high pressure polyethylenes is relatively even, and both lower molecular weight components and high molecular weight components have almost similar numbers of branches. Another important feature of high pressure polyethylenes is that the polyethylenes also have long chain branches in complicated structures. Identification of these long chain branches is difficult, but these branches are considered to be alkyl groups of which lengths vary from about lengths of main chains to lengths having carbon atoms of over several thousands. The presence of these long chain branches largely affects melt rheology characteristics of polymers and this is one of the reasons for the excellent processability of high pressure method polyethylenes. On the other hand, ethylene α olefin copolymers synthesized under a medium to low pressure with a transition metal catalyst and having densities about equal to those of high pressure polyethylenes, are obtained by copolymerizing ethylene and an α olefin under a medium to low pressure of about 5 to 150 bar and at 0 250 C normally at a relatively low temperature of 30 to 200 C with a transition metal catalyst in an autoclave or a tubular reactor. Their molecular structures are relatively simple. These ethylene α olefin copolymers seldom possess long chain branches and have only short chain branches. These short chain branches are not formed through complicated reaction processes as so in high pressure polyethylenes, but are controlled by the kind of an α olefin to be used in the copolymerization. As an example, in a copolymerization between ethylene and butene 1, short chain branches formed are normally ethyl branches. These branches could be hexyl branches as a result of dimerization of butene 1 . Short chain branches formed control crystallinities and densities of polymers. Distribution of short chain branches is also affected by the nature of a transition metal catalyst used in the copolymerization, the type of polymerization and the temperature of polymerization. Different from the case of high pressure polyethylenes, the distribution is wide. Namely, as a general trend, lower molecular weight components have larger S.C.B. and higher molecular weight components have smaller S.C.B. cf. Reference Example 1 . Ethylene α olefin copolymers obtained by copolymerizing ethylene and an α olefin under a medium to low pressure with a transition metal catalyst and having densities about equal to those of high pressure polyethylenes, have come to be practically used. Therefore, the conventional classification that polyethylene resins having densities of 0.910 to 0.935 g cm Presence or absence of long chain branches is clarified to a considerable extent by a theory of solution. As an example, the presence of long chain branches in an ethylene polymer can be known by using η η , namely g η. Herein, η is the intrinsic viscosity of the ethylene polymer, and η This method is useful, but practically the presence of long chain branches can be known more easily and clearly by a correlation between melt index and intrinsic viscosity of polymer. This correlation was shown in Reference Example 3. In there, the intrinsic viscosity of a high pressure polyethylene is far lower than that of the ethylene α olefin copolymer according to a medium to low pressure method having the same melt index, because the former polyethylene has long chain branches. Due to the difference of presence or absence of long chain branches, high pressure polyethylenes and ethylene α olefin copolymers give largely different properties in melt rheology characteristics, crystallinity, solid mechanical properties and optical properties. The present inventors made strenuous efforts with an aim to obtain polyethylenes which will solve the above mentioned defects of polyethylenes, will have a processability equal to or better than that of high pressure polyethylenes, and will be excellent in tear strength, impact strength, environmental stress cracking resistance, low temperature resistance, creep characteristics, chemicals resistance, transparency and heat sealing characteristics. As a result, the present inventors have found that, by mixing a an ethylene α olefin copolymer having a relatively higher molecular weight and of which density, intrinsic viscosity, S.C.B., kind of α olefin and weight average molecular weight number average molecular weight are specified and b another ethylene α olefin copolymer having a relatively lower molecular weight and of which density, intrinsic viscosity, S.C.B., kind of α olefin and weight average molecular weight number average molecular weight are specified, in such a way that the ratio of S.C.B. of the former copolymer over S.C.B. of the latter copolymer is in a specified range, ethylene copolymer compositions can be obtained which have extremely good processability compared with the conventional polyethylenes, as well as very excellent physical and chemical properties such as tear strength, impact strength, environmental stress cracking resistance, low temperature resistance, creep characteristics, chemicals resistance, transparency, and heat sealing characteristics. The present inventors have also found that ethylene α olefin copolymer compositions substantially not having long chain branches and having a specific distribution of S.C.B. provide extremely good properties such as tensile strength, impact strength, environmental stress cracking resistance, low temperature resistance, creep characteristics, chemicals resistance, transparency and heat sealing characteristics, compared with the conventional polyethylenes, and therefore, with such ethylene α olefin copolymer compositions, improvement of processability by broadening of molecular weight distribution can be attained without deterioration of properties described above. Thus, the present invention has been achieved. According to the present invention, there is provided an ethylene α olefin copolymer composition excellent in strength and having a density of 0.915 to 0.929 g cm The present invention also provides a composition of copolymer of ethylene and an α olefin of 3 to 18 carbon atoms, having the following properties The first feature of this invention is to provide an ethylene copolymer composition of which processability is about equal to or better than that of high pressure polyethylenes and of which physical and chemical properties such as tensile strength, impact strength, environmental stress cracking resistance, creep characteristics, tear strength, transparency, heat sealing characteristics and chemicals resistance are very excellent. The second feature of this invention is that, because the product of this invention is excellent in mechanical strengths, has a rigidity higher than those of high pressure polyethylenes and has a transparency about equal to that of high pressure polyethylenes, material saving can be expected with the product of this invention for instance, when this product is used for films, the same performance can be obtained with the thickness of 10 to 20 thinner than that of high pressure polyethylenes. The third feature of this invention is that, because the product of this invention has extrusion processability superior to that of relatively low density ethylene α olefin copolymers by the conventional technique, conventional extruders being used for high pressure polyethylenes can be utilized for the present product without any modification. The fourth feature of this invention is that, because the present product, even if possessing a melt index lower than that of low density ethylene α olefin copolymers by the conventional technique, shows satisfactory flow properties in actual processing, it gives excellent bubble stability and mechanical strengths of machine and transverse directions can be easily balanced, whereby molded products can have a uniform quality. The fifth feature of this invention is that, because a resin composition less sticky than low density ethylene α olefin copolymers by the conventional technique is obtained even when the density of the composition is lowered, the composition can be applied even for the usages where transparency, flexibility and impact characteristics are required. In the attached drawings, Figs. 1 to 5 show curves of molecular weight distributions obtained from gel permeation chromatography. Broken lines in these figures are for dividing lower molecular weight components and high molecular weight components into two respective territories. Fig. 6 is a typical example showing distribution of S.C.B. against molecular weight of an ethylene α olefin copolymer of the conventional technique. Fig. 7 shows correlations between melt indices MI and tensile impact strengths of ethylene α olefin copolymers of the conventional technique, with their melt flow ratios MFR used as a parameter. Fig. 8 shows correlations between Ml and intrinsic viscosities η of a high pressure polyethylene and a linear polyethylene of the medium to low pressure method as a method for distinguishing these two polymers. In the figure, a broken line is drawn to separate two territories, the left side territory is for the high pressure polyethylene of the conventional technique and the right side territory is for the linear polyethylene of the medium to low pressure method. The present invention will be explained in more detail below. An ethylene α olefin copolymer of a relatively high molecular weight hereinafter referred to as copolymer A which is used in the present invention as one mixing component, is a copolymer of ethylene and an α olefin of 3 to 18 carbon atoms. This α olefin is one represented by the general formula R CH CH The molecular weight of the copolymer A is 1.2 to 6.0 dl g as intrinsic viscosity and preferred to be 1.2 to 4.5 dl g. When the intrinsic viscosity is below 1.2 dl g, mechanical strengths of polymer compositions of the present invention are reduced. Over 6.0 dl g, mixing with the copolymer B becomes difficult, and the polymer compositions obtained have fish eyes and further worsened flow properties as well as reduced transparency. In injection molding, the intrinsic viscosity is preferably 1.2 to 4.0 dl g and more preferably 1.2 to 3.0 dl g. If it is less than 1.2 dl g, mechanical strengths of compositions are lowered. If it is over 4.0 dl g, mixing with the copolymer B becomes insufficient, and the polymer compositions obtained have fish eyes, deteriorated flow properties tend to cause flow marks and reduced transparency. Weight average molecular weight Number average molecular weight of the copolymer A which is a measure for the molecular weight distribution of the copolymer obtained from gel permeation chromatography hereinafter abbreviated as GPC , is 2 to 10 and preferably 3 to 8. If it is less than 2, such a copolymer A is difficult to produce. If it is over 10, polymer compositions have lower mechanical strengths and, when processed into films, cause blocking. An ethylene α olefin copolymer of a relatively low molecular weight hereinafter abbreviated as copolymer B which is used in the present invention as another mixing component, is a copolymer of ethylene and an α olefin of 3 to 18 carbon atoms. As α olefins, there may be selected the α olefins used in the copolymer A. The density of the copolymer B is 0.910 to 0.955 g cm The molecular weight of the copolymer B is 0.3 to 1.5 dl g preferably 0.4 to 1.5 dl g as intrinsic viscosity. When the intrinsic viscosity is less than 0.3 dl g, mechanical strengths and transparency of compositions are reduced. In case of over 1.5 dl g, fluidity of compositions is poor. In the area of injection molding, the molecular weight of the copolymer B is preferably 0.3 to 1.2 dl g as intrinsic viscosity and more preferably 0.4 to 1.2 dl g. When the intrinsic viscosity is below 0.3 dl g, mechanical strengths and transparency of compositions are reduced. In case of over 1.2 dl g, fluidity of compositions is poor. The value of weight average molecular weight number average molecular weight , namely, The copolymer A and the copolymer B as mentioned above can be obtained by copolymerizing ethylene and an α olefin of 3 to 18 carbon atoms under a medium to low pressure using a transition metal catalyst. For instance, catalysts such as Ziegler type catalyst and Phillips type catalyst as well as polymerization methods such as slurry polymerization, gas phase polymerization and solution polymerization are used. As catalysts, a Ziegler type catalyst system using a carrier supported Ziegler catalyst component is convenient in this invention from its activity and copolymerizability. Specific examples of an effective carrier of this carrier supported Ziegler catalyst component include oxides, hydroxides, chlorides and carbonates of metals and silicon and their mixtures as well as inorganic complexes. More specifically, they are magnesium oxides, titanium oxides, silica, alumina, magnesium carbonates, divalent metal hydroxychlorides, magnesium hydroxides, magnesium chlorides, magnesium alkoxides, magnesium haloalkoxides, double oxides of magnesium and aluminum and double oxides of magnesium and calcium. Among these compounds, magnesium compounds are particularly preferred. The following magnesium compounds are particularly preferred. The following magnesium compound carrier is most preferred in the production of the low density polyethylene type resin composition of this invention, because it gives a satisfactory slurry with no abnormal tackiness and there occurs no sticking of polymers to the reactor wall. Reference is made to Japanese Patent Publication No. 23561 1980 . Namely, it is the carrier obtained by a reacting in a solvent an aluminum halide represented by the general formula R As a transition metal catalyst component supported on carriers, there are, for instance, titanium compounds, vanadium compounds and zirconium compounds. Specific examples include titanium tetrachloride, titanium tetrabromide, titanium tetraiodide, titanium trichloride, titanium alkoxy halides or titanium aryloxy halides represented by the general formula Ti OR As a component of carrier supported Ziegler catalysts used in this invention, there are also reaction products between an organomagnesium compound and a transition metal compound. Here, the transition metal compound is represented by the general formula Ti OR As an organometal compound component which forms the catalyst system of this invention together with the carrier supported Ziegler catalyst component, there are organoaluminum compounds such as trialkyl aluminums triethyl aluminum, tri n propyl aluminum, tri i butyl alminum, tri n butyl aluminum, tri n hexyl aluminum, etc. , dialkyl aluminum monohalides diethyl aluminum monochloride, di n propyl aluminum monochloride, di i butyl aluminum monochloride, di n butyl aluminum monochloride, di n hexyl aluminum monochloride, etc. , alkyl aluminum dihalides ethyl aluminum dichloride, n propyl aluminum dichloride, i butyl aluminum dichloride, n butyl aluminum dichloride, n hexyl aluminum dichloride, etc. , ethyl aluminum sesquichloride, i propyl aluminum sesquichloride, i butyl aluminum sesquichloride, n butyl aluminum sesquichloride and n hexyl aluminum sesquichloride as well as other organometal compounds such as organozinc compounds. These organometal compounds may be used alone or in combination of two or more. In compounding the composition of this invention using the ethylene α olefin copolymer A of relatively higher molecular weight and the ethylene α olefin copolymer B of relatively lower molecular weight both of which are obtained with the above catalyst system under a normal medium to low pressure polymerization method, the following matters must be obeyed. As long as the scope of this invention is obeyed, mixing of the ethylene α olefin copolymer A of relatively higher molecular weight and the ethylene α olefin copolymer B of relatively lower molecular weight is not necessarily limited to mixing one of each kind. The mixing may be also done by using two or more kinds of each of the copolymer A and the copolymer B. There is no particular limitation to mixing methods of the copolymers A and B, and known methods can be used in mixing of these two polymers. Commonly used are a batch type melt kneading method which employs a twin roll or a Banbury mixer after separate production of the copolymers A and B, a continuous melt kneading method employing a twin rotor mixer such as CIM manufactured by the Japan Steel Works or FCM manufactured by Kobe Steel or a single screw extruder and a solution mixing method in which a mixture is obtained by dissolving the copolymers A and B in a solvent separately or together, blending and finally removing the solvent. When the copolymers A and B are produced by a high temperature solution polymerization method, it is advantageous from the process standpoint that their composition is obtained by mixing A and B in a solution state at high temperatures and removing the solvent. Mixing by a two or multi stage polymerization method is also possible. In this method, in the first stage, the copolymer A is polymerized for a certain length of time and, successively in the second stage, the copolymer B is polymerized using the same catalyst but changing other polymerization conditions until the composition containing the copolymers A and B at an intended ratio is obtained. In this case, the order of polymerization of A and B is not restricted. The above two or multi stage polymerization method is an ideal mixing method, because the copolymers A and B undergo molecular dispersion. The most effective mixing method can be selected from above various mixing methods, in order to obtain a uniform composition, which meets intended requirements. The intrinsic viscosity η of the ethylene α olefin copolymer composition of this invention is preferred to be 0.7 to 4 dl g and more preferred to be 0.8 to 3.5 dl g and most preferred to be 0.9 to 3 dl g. When the intrinsic viscosity is below the lower limit, mechanical strengths are reduced and, in blown film processing, bubble stability is insufficient. In case of above the upper limit, extrusion processability worsens. S.C.B. of the composition is 10 to 35. When S.C.B. is below its lower limit, transparency worsens. When S.C.B. is above its upper limit, mechanical strengths are reduced and molded products have tackiness. Next, the index of long chain branching of the copolymer composition of this invention is described. When the intrinsic viscosity of a copolymer composition of this invention is put as η and the intrinsic viscosity of a linear polyethylene having the same The ethylene α olefin copolymer composition of this invention is preferred to have g η of the copolymer at least 0.9 and practically has no long chain branches. When g η is below 0.8 and contains a large quantity of long chain branches, the copolymer is poor in tensile strength, impact strength, environmental stress cracking resistance, low temperature resistance and chemicals resistance. S.C.B. of higher molecular weight components S.C.B. of lower molecular weight components of the copolymer composition of this invention is 0.6 to 0.8. Here, these S.C.B. are obtained by dividing the composition of this invention into two groups of lower molecular weight components and higher molecular weight components using molecular weight fractionation and then measuring S.C.B. of each group. When the ratio is below 0.6, mechanical strengths of the composition are poor, and when the composition is subjected to extrusion processing and injection molding, balancing of MD and TD strengths is difficult and molded products have sticky surfaces, and in films, heat sealing characteristics worsen. When the ratio is over 0.8, transparency worsens and therefore such a polymer is not suitable for applications where transparency is required. The above molecular weight fractionation of the ethylene α olefin copolymer into two groups of lower and higher molecular weight components refers to the following method. Molecular weight fractionation is conducted by the known column fractionation method. Its detailed explanation is made in Polymer Fractionation compiled by M. J. R. Cantow, Academic Press, published in 1967 . and therefore, only the outline of the method is described below. About 5 g of a sample is adsorbed on a carrier, Celite 745, in xylene and the carrier is charged into a column. The column is heated to 130 C and a mixed solvent of butyl cellosolve and xylene is passed through the column with their mixing ratio being gradually changed namely with the solvency of the mixed solvent being gradually changed . The lower molecular weight fractions to higher molecular weight fractions are successively fractionated. To each eluate is added methanol to cause precipitation. After recovery of each polymer, they are dried under reduced pressure to be used as each fraction. To prevent the decomposition of polymers during fractionation, 100 ppm of Irganox 1076 is added to the original sample as a stabilizer, and also nitrogen is passed through the column to shut off oxygen. The polymer fractions obtained are divided into two groups of lower and higher molecular weight components so that the weight ratio of these two groups become the above mentioned weight ratio. Each group is made into a press sheet of about 100 to 300 µm thickness and these sheets are subjected to Fourier transform infra red absorption spectroscopy. Further, it is preferable that the characteristic values of the sample obtained by dividing the ethylene α olefin copolymer of this invention into two fractions such as a higher molecular weight component and a lower molecular weight component are same to the characteristic values of copolymer A and copolymer B. respectively, as previously defined. When compared with low density ethylene α olefin copolymers obtained from the conventional medium to low pressure method normally called linear low density polyethylene or LLDPE , the polyethylene type resin composition of this invention has the following advantages. In the field of extrusion processing, the composition of this invention is largely excellent in processability about equal even to high pressure polyethylenes and moreover has excellent mechanical strengths ESCR, tensile strength, impact strength and tear strength as well as excellent low temperature resistance. Therefore, reduction in thicknesses of molded products becomes possible. The composition of this invention has wide applications and can be used even in the application where transparency is required. In case of films, the present composition is far superior in processability about equal even to high pressure polyethylenes . Further, the composition has excellent mechanical strengths such as tensile strength, impact strength and tear strength, by which reduction in thicknesses of films becomes possible. Moreover, the present composition has excellent transparency and heat sealing characteristics, by which it is used as a high quality film in wide applications including high speed bag manufacturing. In the field of injection molding, the present composition is largely excellent in processability about equal even to high pressure polyethylenes . Moreover, there occurs no flow marks, there is no warpage with molded products, and transparency, low temperature resistance and mechanical strengths such as environmental stress cracking resistance, tensile strength and impact strength are excellent. Thereby, reduction in thicknesses of molded products is possible and the present composition has wide applications including the case where transparency is required. To the composition of this invention, can be added if necessary various additives being commonly used in the industries such as oxidation inhibitors, lubricants, anti blocking agents, anti static agents, photostabilizers, and coloring pigments. Also, other polymers can be added in small quantities as long as the scope of this invention is kept. Next, the definitions of physical and chemical properties used in this invention are explained below. The present invention is explained below in more detail by the following examples, but it is not restricted by these examples. In a 500 ml four necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel was placed 16.0 g of flake shaped magnesium to be used for the production of Grignard reagents. The air and moisture inside the flask were completely replaced by nitrogen. Into the dropping funnel were charged 68 ml 0.65 mol of n butyl chloride and 30 ml of n butyl ether. About 30 ml of this solution was dropped into the flask to initiate a reaction, and thereafter the rest of the solution was dropped in 4 hours at 50 C. After the completion of dropping, the reaction was continued for further 1.5 hours at 60 C. Then, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature and the unreacted magnesium was filtered off by the use of a glass filter. n Butyl magnesium chloride in the n butyl ether was measured for its concentration by hydrolyzing with 1 N sulfuric acid and back titrating with 1 N sodium hydroxide using phenolphthalein as an indicator. The concentration was 1.96 mol l. The air and moisture inside a 500 ml four necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a dropping funnel and a thermometer was completely replaced by nitrogen. In the flask was placed 130 ml of the n butyl ether solution containing 0.26 mol of n butyl magnesium chloride synthesized in the above step 1 . From the dropping funnel was dropped 30 ml 0.26 mol of silicon tetrachloride over 2 hours at 50 C. The reaction was continued further 1 hour at 60 C. The formed white solid was separated. washed with n heptane and dried under reduced pressure to obtain 31.5 g of a white solid. Ten grams of this white solid was placed in a 100 ml four necked flask and 50 ml of titanium tetrachloride was added. They were allowed to react with stirring for 1 hour at 100 C. After the completion of the reaction, n heptan washing was applied until the washings became free from titanium tetrachloride. After drying under reduced pressure, 7.9 g of a solid catalyst component was obtained. Each 1 g of this solid catalyst component supported 14 mg of titanium.

Successively, the second stage polymerization was conducted for 180 min. by changing only the hydrogen partial pressure and the ethylene partial pressure as shown in Table 11. In both stages, the liquid phase molar ratio of ethylene, butene 1 and hydrogen was kept constant at respective fixed levels. The polymerized quantities in each stage were calculated from the quantities of fed ethylene. The copolymer composition consisted of about 50 by weight of higher molecular weight components and about 50 by weight of lower molecular weight components. Immediately before the completion of the first stage polymerization, a part of the polymer was taken out and measured for its density, intrinsic viscosity and S.C.B. The whole polymer obtained after the second stage was also measured for the same test items. From the values of the first stage polymer and the whole polymer, the intrinsic viscosity and the number of branched short chains of the polymer formed in the second stage alone were calculated. These values were shown in Table 11. The whole polymer gave density 0.921 g cm Because of bimodal distribution which has two peaks, the curve was divided into two parts using broken lines. The areas of each part were calculated, and the lower molecular weight components and the higher molecular weight components were determined to be 48 and 52 by weight, respectively. The whole polymer was divided into 30 fractions using column chromatography. These fractions were divided into two parts the lower molecular weight components and the higher molecular weight components so that the former became 48 by weight and the latter 52 by weight. S.C.B., densities and intrinsic viscosities of each component are shown in Table 13. Flow characteristics and solid physical properties of the whole polymer are shown in Table 14. In the following examples, ethylene α olefin copolymers as higher molecular weight components and ethylene α olefin copolymers as lower molecular weight components were mixed at respective fixed ratios total quantity 1 kg and kneaded for 5 min. with a Banbury mixer 150 to 230 rpm . At that time, replacement by nitrogen was conducted completely and the polymer temperatures were controlled not to exceed 250 C. When sample quantities were small, mixing was made in xylene. After mixing, the whole solution was added into methanol to cause precipitation. After filtration, the precipitate was completely dried in a vacuum drier and used as a copolymers composition sample. Ethylene α olefin copolymers obtained in Example 1 and ethylene α olefin copolymers obtained in Example 2 were kneaded with a Banbury mixer at ratios as shown in Table 12. Thus, compositions of copolymers having densities. Mls, MFRs. intrinsic viscosities, S.C.B. and g η shown in Table 13 were obtained. These compositions had molecular weight distribution curves about equal to Fig. 4. With the same technique as used in Example 3, quantities of lower molecular weight components and higher molecular weight components were calculated, and they were both approximately 50 by weight as shown in Table 13. Physical properties of these compositions are shown in Table 14. With the same technique as used in Example 3, column fractionation was applied in order to divide into higher molecular weight components and lower molecular weight components. Characteristics of the components are shown in Table 13. In Tables 13 and 14 are also shown Example 3 using a composition of ethylene α olefin copolymers prepared in two stage polymerization and, for comparison, Comparative Example 1 using a high pressure method polyethylene of the conventional technique commercial product Sumikathene F 101 1 manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. , Comparative Example 2 using a composition of low density ethylene α olefin copolymers of the conventional technique and Comparative Example 3 using a composition of low density ethylene α olefin copolymers of the conventional technique of which molecular weight distribution is made wider and of which lower molecular weight components have larger S.C.B. and of which higher molecular weight components have smaller S.C.B. As is obvious from Tables 13 and 14, when compared with the high pressure polyethylene, the copolymer compositions of this invention have about equivalent Brabender torques excellent in processability , and are largely excellent in tensile impact strength, rigidity, ESCR and tensile strength. Transparency is equally good, because distribution index of S.C.B. is in a certain range as defined by the present invention. When compared with the composition of low density ethylene α olefin copolymers of the conventional technique, the compositions of this invention have far smaller Brabender torques much better processability and higher tensile impact strengths and tensile strengths. From comparison between Comparative Examples 2 and 3 in Tables 13 and 14, it is learned that widening of molecular weight distribution larger MFR gives wider distribution in the manufacture of a low density ethylene α olefin copolymer of the conventional technique with density and Ml fixed results in large reduction in tensile impact strength and tensile strength. A composition of ethylene α olefin copolymers was prepared by mixing an ethylene α olefin copolymer obtained in Example 1 and an ethylene α olefin copolymer obtained in Example 2 at a ratio shown in Table 15. Densities, Mls, MFRs, η , S.C.B. and g η of this composition is shown in Table 16. The physical properties are shown in Table 17. The molecular weight distribution of Example 6 showed one almost symmetrical mountain curve. Column fractionation was applied with the same technique as used in Example 3. Its result is shown in Table 16. In Tables 16 and 17 are also shown low density ethylene α olefin copolymers of the conventional technique Comparative Examples 4 and 5 of which molecular weight distributions are made wider and of which lower molecular weight components have larger S.C.B. and of which higher molecular weight components have smaller S.C.B. Curves of molecular weight distributions of Comparative Examples 4 and 5 were similar to that of Example 6. As seen from Tables 16 and 17, in the composition of this invention, S.C.B. of higher molecular weight components and those of lower molecular weight components are nearly equal compare Example 6 with Comparative Example 4. , therefore, the composition of the present invention is far superior to the copolymers of the conventional technique in tensile impact strength and tensile strength. A commercial high pressure polyethylene Sumikathene F 101 1 manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. was subjected to measurements of physical properties and. Results are shown in Table 14. This polyethylene has low g η of 0.48 and it suggests that this sample has many long chain branches. Its molecular weight distribution curve was shown in Fig. 5. Column fractionation was applied with the same technique as used in Example 12. The fractions obtained were divided into two groups so that the lower molecular weight component group and the higher molecular weight component group became about 36 and 64 by weight, respectively. Densities, S.C.B. and intrinsic viscosity of each group are measured and results are shown in Table 13. A low density ethylene α olefin copolymer of the conventional technique was synthesized using the catalyst produced in Reference Example 1, triethyl aluminum co catalyst and other polymerization conditions as shown in Table 18. The copolymer gave density 0.920 g cm By mixing the ethylene α olefin copolymer A 4 obtained in Example 1 and the ethylene α olefin copolymer B 4 obtained in Example 2 at the ratio as given in Table 12, a composition of low density ethylene α olefin copolymers of the conventional technique was prepared of which molecular weight distribution is made wider and of which lower molecular weight components have larger S.C.B. and of which higher molecular weight components have smaller S.C.B. Its density, MI, MFR, η , and g η are shown in Table 13. The molecular weight distribution curve of this composition was almost equal to that in Fig. 4. With the same technique as used in Example 3, the ratio of the lower and higher molecular weight components was determined. Column fractionation was also conducted. These results are shown in Table 13. Physical properties of this composition are shown in Table 14. By mixing ethylene α olefin copolymers obtained in Example 1 and ethylene α olefin copolymers obtained in Example 2 at ratios as shown in Table 15, compositions of low density ethylene α olefin copolymers of the conventional technique were prepared of which molecular weight distributions are made wider and of which lower molecular weight components have larger S.C.B. and of which higher molecular weight components have smaller S.C.B. Densities, Mls, MFRs, η , S.C.B. and g η of these compositions were shown in Tables 16. Physical properties of these compositions are shown in Table 17. An ethylene α olefin copolymer was synthesized from ethylene and butene 1, using the catalyst produced in Reference Example 1, diethyl aluminum monochloride co catalyst and other polymerization conditions as shown in Table 19. Properties of this copolymer are shown in Table 20. By applying column fractionation, the copolymer was fractionated into fractions of different molecular weights. Then, distribution of S.C.B. against molecular weight was examined as shown in Fig. 7. In column fractionation, about 5 g of the sample was placed in a fractionation column after being adsorbed on a carrier Celite 745 in xylene. Then, the column was heated to 130 C, and butyl cellosolve and xylene were passed through the column with the mixing ratio being gradually changed in order to obtain a gradual increase in solvency. Thus, all the copolymer fractions of lower to higher molecular weight were separated. To the eluates was added methanol to cause precipitation of the copolymers. After recovery, the polymers were dried under reduced pressure and each copolymer fraction was obtained. In the above column fractionation process, in order to prevent the possible decomposition of the copolymers, 100 ppm of Irganox 1076 was added to the original sample and further air inside the column was replaced by nitrogen. Using each copolymer fraction, pressed sheets having about 100 to 300 µm thickness were prepared, and S.C.B. of each copolymer fraction were calculated by conducting Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy. Molecular weights of each copolymer fraction were calculated, using intrinsic viscosities η measured in tetralin of 135 C and the following formula With ethylene α olefin copolymers of the conventional technique, a relationship between melt index MI and tensile impact strength was examined with melt flow ratio MFR used as a parameter. Results were shown in Fig 8. It is revealed that widening of molecular weight distribution results in remarkable reduction in tensile impact strength. In the figure, molecular weight distribution was represented by MFR. Larger MFR means wider molecular weight distribution. . These ethylene α olefin copolymers were subjected to molecular weight fractionation with the same technique as used in Reference Example 10. All the copolymers showed trends similar to that of Reference Example 10. The fractions were divided into two groups lower molecular weight group and higher molecular weight group in such a way that each group became about 50 by weight, and S.C.B. of higher molecular weight component S.C.B. of lower molecular weight component was calculated. It was below 0.5 in all the copolymers. With a high pressure method polyethylene of the conventional technique and a linear, high density polyethylene of medium to low pressure method, correlations between melt index MI and intrinsic viscosity η were examined and are shown in Fig. 9. The correlation lines of each sample are clearly divided by a partition line broken line . It is learned that the high pressure polyethylene has much lower intrinsic viscosity than that of the linear high density polyethylene of the same melt index. A correlation between melt index and intrinsic viscosity was examined with the ethylene α olefin copolymers of the present invention. All of the copolymers of the present invention fell in the zone of the linear, high density polyethylene.
