# Heat sink assemblies and electrical insulators used therein.

## Abstract
An electrical insulator 10 is provided for use in connecting a heat generating electrical component 45 to a heat sink 42. Fasteners 30, 50 which include insulators of the present inven tion include pre assembly means, such as a plurality of resili ently flexible arms 16, for securing the insulator 10 to the elec trically conductive fastener. The insulator may be made of high performance plastics material or of a coated metal. The fasten er used with the insulator preferably has an integral spring washer 32 to maintain thermal conductivity between the com ponent 45 and the heat sink 42. The insulator 10 preferably has an integral boss 18 which prevents arcing between the con ductive fastener and the heat sink.
