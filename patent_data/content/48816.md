# VIRTUAL MEMORY MICROCOMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

## Abstract
A microcomputer system has a microprocessor 25 whose functions are implemented by instructions and data from a directly connected random access memory RAM 12 . The capacity of the RAM is less than the typical total instruction list for the microprocessor. A read only mass memory 14 is connected to the RAM and has permanently stored instructions set therein for the microprocessor. A controller 20a, 20b controls the flow of instructions from the mass memory to the RAM as required and also controls the flow of instructions and data between the RAM and microprocessor. The instructions from the mass memory are overlayed in the RAM in areas no longer required for instruction execution.
