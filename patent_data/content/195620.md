# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING GUANIDINES SUCH AS LINOGLIRIDE AND PROCESS FOR INTERMEDIATES

## Abstract
Novel synthetic steps and intermediates leading to guanidines such as the anti diabetic compound linogliride. Included is a hydrogen peroxide oxidation of a thiourea II to a sulfonic acid I which may then be reacted with morpho line to form the carboximidamide III
