# HYDRODYNAMIC NON CONTACTING SEAL FOR ROTARY MACHINES

## Abstract
A non contacting, hydrodynamic end face seal in a machine comprises a disc shaped rotor 1 attached to the machine shaft 2 and an annular stator 3 concentric with the rotor 1 and facing the rotor surface 11 at a small distance. From the stator surface 31 project a number of radially extending weirs 34 which form wedge shaped gaps with the rotor surface, so formed that the gaps decrease in width in the direction of the velocity of the rotor surface 11 across the weirs, causing a hydrodynamic pressure to build up between the weir edges. The outer end of each weir 34 is connected to the inner end of the adjacent weir 34 , downstream thereof, by a diagonal ridge of a height not exceeding the maximum height of the weirs 34 , the ridges and weirs containing between them a high pressure zone HP . A rim 36 surrounds the weirs 34 and ridges on their outside and projects from the stator surface 31 towards the rotor surface 11 to a height equal to the maximum height of the weirs 34 , and thus forms a dam preventing liquid from escaping to the outside of the seal.
