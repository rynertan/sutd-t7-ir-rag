# SYNCHRONIZING SIGNAL DETECTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A synchronizing signal detecting circuit for a digital da ta reproducing apparatus having a reproducing device 12 connected to a magnetic head 11 for deriving digital sig nals, a phase locked loop circuit 16 connected to the re producing device for generating a clock signal based on the derived digital signals, a sync. synchronizing counter 17 for generating sync. timings by counting the clock signal, a plurality of sync. pattern detecting circuits 13, 14 connect ed to the reproducing device 12 for detecting sync. pat terns included in the digital signals, and a logic circuit 15 connected to the plurality of sync. pattern detecting circuits 13, 14 for supplying an initialize pulse to the sync. counter 17 upon detecting successive sync. patterns in the digital signals at the plurality of sync. pattern detecting circuits.
