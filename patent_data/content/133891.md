# Scroll type fluid displacement machine.

## Abstract
A scroll type hydraulic machine, particularly, a com pressor, in which thrust flows acting on a pair of orbiting scrolls 27, 127 cancel one another, thereby improving the reliability of the machine. The hydraulic machine includes first and second fluid volume changing mechanisms, each of which has a stationary scroll 40, 140 and a respective one of the orbiting scrolls 27, 127 assembled together such that fluid introduced between the wraps 39, 41, 139, 141 of the two scrolls is reduced in volume and discharged. A crank mechanism including a crankshaft 23 having an eccentric through hole 30 extending therethrough has a first crank portion 25 at one end for rotatably supporting a shaft 28 of the orbiting scroll 27 of the first fluid volume changing mechanism and a second crank portion 125 at the other end thereof rotatably supporting the orbiting scroll 127 of the second fluid volume changing mechanism. A thrust cancelling shaft 29 is disposed in the eccentric through hole 30 supporting at the opposed ends thereof the orbiting scrolls 27, 127 of the first and second fluid volume changing mechanisms. The thrust forces exerted on the first and second orbiting scrolls cancel one another through the thrust cancelling shaft 29 .
