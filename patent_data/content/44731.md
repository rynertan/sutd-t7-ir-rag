# CONVEYOR WEIGHING ASSEMBLY AND ASSOCIATED METHOD

## Abstract
Conveyor weighing assembly and associated method for weighing individually articles being transported by a conveyor, wherein an article 9 to be weighed is moved from an upstream portion 7 of the conveyor on to a weigh head 1 by the action of the upstream conveyor portion 7 on the article 9 , the article is weighed whilst it is stationary on the weigh head 1 , and is then moved on to a downstream portion 8 of the conveyor, as a consequence of the action on the weighed article 9 of the following article 9 as it is received on the weigh head 1 from the upstream conveyor portion 7 . The weigh head preferably is provided with a weigh cell 6 and associated microprocessor means for providing a signal representative of the weight of the stationary article upon the weigh head. The microprocessor means can be programmed to scan the signal and to determine the minimum gradient thereof, thereby providing the most accurate weight reading. Alternatively, the micro processor means can be programmed to predict by extrapola tion the minimum gradient of the signal. Also, the program med microprocessor means can be used to sense the presence of an article to be weighed upon the weigh head. In a preferred embodiment of the assembly, the downstream conveyor portion 8 is located at a lower level than that of the upstream portion 7 , with the weigh head 1 located at an intermediate level between the two conveyor portions 7,8 .
