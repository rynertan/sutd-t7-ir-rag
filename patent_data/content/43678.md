# Weighing and counting methods.

## Abstract
A weighing method comprising a process in which a plu rality of weighing machines 1 weigh goods, and the weighing values obtained by the weighing machines are combin ational added to compute total weight of all the combinations, so that a combination equal to or nearest the set weight is ob tained among the combinations of total weight, thereby dis charging groups of goods corresponding to the obtained com bination from the weighing machines corresponding thereto. Hence, the weighing method can carry out the weighing of an extremely high accuracy even when the objective goods are larger in the weight and dispersion thereof or relatively smaller in the set weight in comparison with the unit weight. Also, it is possible for the method to divide weighing values gained from each weighing machine by the unit weight of the goods and convert the values into the number of goods and then the same combinational addition is carried out, thereby accurately measuring a desired number of goods.
