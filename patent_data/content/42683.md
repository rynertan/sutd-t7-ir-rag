# Process for the production of adsorptive gas traps.

## Abstract
An adsorptive trap for monitoring gases and or vapours comprises a tube 1, 10, 11 e.g. length about 4 8 cm, internal diameter about 3 5 mm packed with one or more suitable adsorbents 3,12,18,19 in appropriate amount e.g. about 0.5 g , each adsorbent being held packed in place between a pair of rigidly fixed porous discs 4,13,20 e.g. porous sintered powder or metal gauze or mesh discs. It has been found that these adsorptive traps provide improved accuracy and precision of measurement as compared with prior art traps in which the adsorbent is relatively loosely packed and retained in the tube. A preferred method of fabricating the traps makes use of thermal contraction and expansion by allowing a previously cooled, contracted, oversize disc to be loosely fitted within the tube and expand on warming to ambient temperature and thereby become rigidly fixed in place.

## Description
MONITORING GASES This invention relates to monitoring gases and vapours and, in particular, to adsorptive traps for use in monitoring gases and vapours present in atmospheres, usually at low concentration. The atmospheres present at some work places, such as operating theatres and chemical plants, contain minor proportions of gases which are potentially harmful to workers, especially on prolonged exposure. For instance, laboratory studies have shown that exposure of animals to low concentrations of anaesthetic gases produces embryo toxic effects, and surveys of female operating theatre staff have indicated an increase in the frequency of spontaneous abortion and foetal abnormalities. It is thus desirable to monitor the exposure of workers to such potentially hazardous materials, and indeed in many countries there are legal requirements to monitor the personal exposure of employees to potentially toxic gases and vapours during their time at work. A variety of monitoring devices are currently available for monitoring exposure to gases and vapours using either biological or personal monitoring techniques, the latter techniques relying upon a sampling of the air in the employee s breathing zone using, for example a device which traps the toxic contaminants for subsequent analysis by an appropriate technique such as gas chromatography. Both active and passive trapping devices may be used passive devices dependant upon sampling of the contaminated atmosphere by a passive mechanism diffusion, whereas active sampling involves sucking a sample of the contaminated atmosphere, either continuously or intermittently, through the trap by suitable means such as a battery operated sampling pump. Trapping of the contaminants may be by either adsorption or molecular sieving. Passive sampling devices, which are generally in the form of a badge or holder containing an adsorptive material such as charcoal cloth or charcoal impregnated cloth, are generally less capable of yielding an accurate and precise estimate of personal exposure than active sampling devices. Passive devices are often at best only semi quantitative and sampling rates vary from one contaminant to another, being dependent upon the inverse of the square root of the molecular weight of the contaminant, amongst other factors. Atypical example of the active adsorptive trap devices currently available is the kind approved by the United States of America,National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health N.I.O.S.H. . These are in the form of a glass tube containing a particulate adsorptive material, such as charcoal or silica gel, packed in the tube in two sections a front section which is retained between an inner porous polyurethane foam plug and an outer glass wool plug which is held in place by means of a V shaped spring clip, and a smaller rear section retained between the inner foam and a further, outer polyurethane foam disc. These N.I.O.S.H.approved tubes are used on a once only basis contaminants trapped in the tube being recovered for analysis by solvent extraction techniques usually with methanol or carbon disulphide, the latter of which is highly toxic. The tube is generally discarded after use. Are appraisal by the present inventors of the desirable properties of adsorptive traps for monitoring gases and vapours has given rise to the development of an improved form of active adsorptive trap which advantageously enables greater accuracy and precision of analysis of trapped contaminants to be achieved. Accordingly, the present invention comprises an adsorptive trap for monitoring gases and or vapours, in the form of a tube packed with one or more suitable adsorbents in appropriate amount, each adsorbent being held packed in place between a pair of rigidly fixed porous discs. It has been found that the adsorptive traps of the present invention give improved accuracy and precision of results when compared with prior art adsorptive traps, suchas.theN.I.O.S.H. approved traps. It is believed that the relatively poor precision obtainable with prior art tubes is attributable in large part to the occurence of channelling in the adsorbents of these tubes, which are relatively loosely packed and in which the adsorbent is retained in a manner which is susceptible to further loosening of the packing. The traps of the invention are widely applicable to the monitoring of materials in general which are present in atmospheres as gases or Vapours, by methods in which sampled atmosphere is passed through the adsorbent in the tube by means of a suitable pumping or entrainment system. The traps may be used for personal, biological or fixed site monitoring and, in particular applications, the traps may be used to monitor the exposure of operating theatre and chemical plant staff to relatively small concentrations of potentially harmful gases and vapours. For biological monitoring applications, a measured volume of exhaled air may be collected from an individual in a sampling bag and then subsequently passed through the adsorptive trap, for instance, using a personal sampling pump, or alternatively, the person to be monitored may exhale a measured volume of air through the adsorptive trap. Provided the substances trapped from the exhaled air are not metabloised, or are metabolised in a predictable fashion, the quantity of substances trapped from a measured volume of air can be related more directly to the past exposure of the individual and to the biological response to that exposure. It will be appreciated that the form and materials of construction of the tubes may be varied widely, for instance, in accordance with the particular application for which the tube is intended.Thus tubes for personal monitoring are normally of a suitable size and shape to be carried conveniently by the worker, for instance attached to external clothing though site monitoring tubes are not usually subject to such constraints. Also, the tubes are not normally of internal diameter below about B of an inch to avoid undesirably high resistance to gaseous flow through the tubes. The length of the tubes may be determined by the amount of absorbent and other packing required, which may in turn depend among other things upon the nature of the gaseous contaminant being monitored and the particle size of the absorbent.It has been found, for example, that tubes of length about 4 8 cm and internal diameter of about 3 5 mm packed with about 0.5g of adsorbent, e.g., Pora pak Q, 50 80 mesh occupying a length of about 5 cm in the tube, are suitable for personal monitoring for over a period of about 10 hours at a gas sampling rate of about 2 5 ml min. Any suitable material may be used for the tubes, including metals, such as copper or nickel, or preferably stainless steel.In cases where there is a possibility of the contaminant which is being monitored interacting with metals, glass or silica tubes may be used, though metal tubes are usually preferred in view of their greater impact resistance. In the tubes of the present invention the absorbent is characteristically held packed in place between a pair of rigidly fixed porous discs. Any suitable form of porous disc may be used, provided it is able to maintain the adsorbent in place in the tube, and also does not cause excessive resistance to gaseous flow through the tube. Thus the discs may comprise porous sintered powder discs eg. sintered powdered stainless steel, nickel or glass discs. Preferably the discs comprise metal gauze or mesh discs, especially sintered metal gauze or mesh discs e.g. sintered stainless steel or nickel gauze discs. Advantageously the surfaces of the discs which are in contact with the adsorbent, and especially both surfaces of each disc, are substantially planar and fixed perpendicularly to the tube walls, to encourage the establishment of substantially uniform gaseous flow across the cross section of the tube. The discs are characteristically rigidly fixed in place in the tube sandwiching the packed adsorbent between them. An adhesive or bonding agent may be used to fix the discs in place in the tube.For instance, discs may be fixed in silica or glass tubes by coating the edges of the discs with an adhesive layer of aqueous silicate solution, e.g. Na2SiO3, which acts by forming covalent, ionic and hydrogen bonding links between the edge of the discs and the wall of the tube. Preferably, however, discs are fixed in the tubes with the aid of thermal contraction and expansion. For instance, an oversize metal or plastic porous sintered disc may be cooled so as to contract thereby enabling it to be loosely fitted within the tube at the desired positon the disc then being permitted to warm up to room temperature and expand as it does so.Being of diameter, at room temperature, greater than the internal diameter of the tube, the disc presses hard against the tube wall and is fixed rigidly in position by compressive forces. The coolant which is used may be, for example, liquid nitrogen. Alternatively the tube may be heated to expand and subsequently cool and contract around the oversize discs, although this method is less desirable than the cooling method. The adsorbent is typically packed between the discs to a high level of integrity for instance, the adsorbent is packed in the tube to the standard at which gas chromatographic adsorbents are packed in gas chromatographic columns. The techniques used for packing may include those which are customarily used for packing gas chromatographic columns, such as use of vibration, usually for a standardised period of time. Usually one disc is fixed in place, the adsorbent is packed against this disc and the second disc is then fixed in place against the packed adsorbent.The invention includes methods for construction of the tubes in which the discs are fixed in place and the adsorbent packed between them. It will be appreciated that the nature of the adsorbent used in the tubes may be varied widely, for instance, in accordance with the substances which are being monitored. Thus, for example the adsorbent in particulate form, may comprise charcoal or silica gel. Also silicate based adsorbents may be used, such as Silicalite andZeolites, especially Zeolite 5A and 13X. Preferred adsorbents also comprise porous polymer adsorbents, such as Porapak series, ChromosorbCentury series and Tenax GC adsorbents. For example, charcoal may be used for adsorption of highly volatile organic materials and also nitrous oxide when the flow rate through the tube is sufficiently low, e.g. about 2 ml min. Furthermore, Zeolite 5A may be used for adsorption of a wide range of organic and inorganic gases and vapours e.g nitrous and nitric oxide, and sulphur dioxide, and porous polymer adsorbents and Silicalite may be used for adsorption of moderate to low volatility organic materials. The tubes may contain more than one adsorbent, the adsorbents being typically separated from one another by intervening rigidly fixed porous discs. Generally, also, separate tubes containing different adsorbents may be used in series. Such use of pluralities of adsorbents may be advantageous if the atmosphere being sampled is likely to contain various different types of gas or vapour which it is desired to monitor. In a preferred embodiment the tubes of the invention contain protective layers of dessicant at either end of the tube to protect the adsorbents against the effects of water, which can adversely affect the adsorptive capacity of the adsorbent as well as interfere with subsequent gas chromatographic analysis of trapped materials. A preferred dessicant for this purpose isZeolite 3A. In a preferred construction the dessicant is held against the outer surfaces of the porous discs at either end of the tube and is replaceable, for instance, held in place by removable glass wool plugs. In use the tube is connected to a suitable pump or gas entrainment system and sampled atmosphere is passed through the tube. The pump used is typically capable of reliably sampling at a low to moderate flow rate, e.g. from about 2 to 100 ml per minute, although higher flow rate pumps may be used for fixed site monitoring, and it will be appreciated that the flow rate of the pump may be varied in accordance with the quantity of adsorbent, the nature of the gas to be adsorbed, and size of tube used. The invention includes monitoring apparatus comprising a tube or tubes together with a suitable pumping or gas entrainment system. The connectors used for connecting the tubes in the gas flow system are typically gas tight connectors. For example, mechanical screw threaded connectors, preferably having gas threads, or other types of quick connection connectors may be used. Examples of suitable commercially available connectors are Swagelok, Enots andGyrolok, of which the latter is particularly preferred. Such connectors may also be used to seal the tubes after monitoring and before assay of adsorbed substances for instance, by means of screw threaded or quick connection plugs. Subsequent to trapping adsorbed substances may be recovered and assayed by any suitable method. Solvent extraction may be used but heat desorption is particularly preferred for recovery of adsorbed substances. For example, oxygen is first of all flushed out of the tubes e.g. by passing a stream of oxygen free nitrogen through the tube for a few seconds, and the tube is heated to desorb the substances which are then flushed out of the tube and assayed. In a preferred method of assay the desorbed gases are passed to a gas chromatography system for assay. It has been found that the adsorptive traps of the present invention generally give improved reproducibility of results when compared with prior art active adsorptive traps in which the adsorbent is not held packed in place between rigidly fixed porous discs. Generally also the traps of the invention are particularly suited for thermal desorption recovery of adsorbed substances, which advantageously avoids the use of toxic solvents such as carbon disulphide. Furthermore the tubes of the invention may be used again on a plurality of occasions after thermal desorption of adsorbates and need not be discarded after a single use. The invention is further described by way of illustration only in the following examples and description which refer to the accompanying diagrams, wherein Figure 1 shows a sectional elevation of a simple form of trap according to the invention, andFigure 2 shows a similar view of a more complex form of trap comprising two tubes in combination. With reference to Figure 1 a simple form of trap according to the present invention comprises a stainless tube 1 or length 6 cm external diameter 6.25 mm and internal diameter 4 mm having external gas tight screw threads 2 at either end thereof stainless steel tube En 58J . The tube 1 contains a 4 cm length of packedPorapak Q adsorbent supplied by Waters Associates sandwiched between a pair of rigidly fixed, planar sintered oversize, 316 stainless steel gauze discs 4 which are perpendicular to the tube walls. 5 mm lengths of Zeolite 3A dessicant 5 are held in place against the outer faces of the discs 4 by removable glass wool plugs 6. In use the tube 1 is connected to a gas flow system by way of suitable connections such as Gyrolok connectors not shown which mate with the screw threaded portions 2. The tube is supplied with sampled atmosphere by means of a suitable sampling pump, such as the MDA Accuhaler 808 personal sampling pump at a flow rate of about 2 ml per min. At completion of sampling the tube 1 is disconnected from the gaseous flow system and its ends are closed by means of screw threaded caps not shown . The adsorbed gases are then thermally desorbed by heating to 180 C after flushing out any oxygen present in the tube with oxygen free nitrogen for 10 seconds at a flow rate of 60 ml min. The desorbed gases are flushed from the tube to a gas chromatography system for assay. The tube of Fig. 1 was manufactured as follows External gas threads 2 are cut on the ends of the length of stainless steel tube 1. The tube is then supported in a vertical orientation and an oversize sintered stainless steel mesh disc previously cooled in liquid nitrogen is dropped into the tube onto a support which supports it loosely at its required position.On warming up to room temperature the disc expands and presses hard against the walls of the tube and is thus held firmly in position. Adsorbent is then introduced to the tube and packed against the fixed disc using conventional chromatography column packing techniques. A second oversize porous disc 4 similarly previously cooled in liquid nitrogen, is then dropped into the tube on top of the adsorbent, and similarly expands on warming to become fixed in place hard against the adsorbent. In this way the adsorbent is held firmly packed within the tube. AlternatiVely the tube may be heated, and subsequently cooled so as to contract and grip around the oversized stainless steel mesh discs. Porous glass discs may be fixed in glass tubes by use of an adhesive. The porous glass discs, which are slightly smaller in diameter than the internal diameter of the tube have their edges treated with a thin layer of aqueous silicate solution e.g. sodium silicate the treated discs are then dropped into the glass tube and the silicate acts as an adhesive firmly bonding the edge of the discs to the wall of the tube. With reference to Figure 2 a more complex form of trap which is particularly suitable for monitoring operating theatre atmospheres, comprises two stainless steel tubes 10 and 11 in combination. The first tube 10, of length about 5 cm, contains a 4 cm packed length of Porapak Q 12 0.4g, 50 80 mesh sandwich between a pair of rigidly fixed oversize 4.8 0.3mm diameter, 1.09mm thickness sintered 316 stainless steel gauze discs 13 cut from 316 sintered stainless steel gauze, supplied by SinteredProducts, Sutton in Ashfield, U.K. . A layer Zeolite 3A dessicant 15 30mg, 20 40 mesh is held against the outer face of the disc 13 at the free end of tube 10 by a glass wool plug 16.The second tube 11, of length about 10cm, contains lengths of two separate adsorbents 18 19 sandwiched side by side between rigidly fixed sintered stainless steel gauze discs 20 the same as those in tube 10. The first adsorbent 18 comprises an approximate 1 cm length of activated coconut charcoal 1OOmg, 20 40 mesh , and the second adsorbent comprises an approximate 8cm length of Zeolite 5A 1.59, 20 40 mesh . A layer of Zeolite 3A dessicant 30mg, 20 40 mesh is held against the outer surface of the disc 20 nearest the free end of the tube 11. Both tubes 10 11 have Gyrolok connectors, compression olives 22 being attached to the exterior of each end of each tube.The tubes are connected by way of a Gyrolok union 23 and Gyrolok hexagonal nuts 24 and 25 attached to the fixed ends of tubes 10 and 11 respectively. The free ends of the tubes 10 11 also haveGyrolok hexagonal nuts 26 27 which together with Gyrolok caps not shown can be used to seal the trap after use, or together with other appropriate fittings not shown can be used to connect the trap to a suitable sampling system. For instance, in use the trap of Figure 2 is connected to an MDA Accuhaler 808 personal sampler pump fitted with a 2 ml min flow rate orifice, and is used to sample an operating theatre atmosphere.Example 1. Comparison of trichloroethylene recovery from prior art tubes and tubes according to the invention.58 prior art adsorption tubes of the NIOSH approved type obtained from four different commercial suppliers and 54 adsorption tubes according to the invention were exposed to atmospheres containing 1,000 Pgl of trichloroethylene for approximately 25 minu tes each. The rate at which air was drawn through the adsorbent tubes, in each case, was 2 ml.min. 1 using a MDAAccuhaler 808 personal sampling pump. Each pump was calibrated 1 by sampling at 2 ml.min. for an accurately measured volume of air 500 ml . A record was kept of the number of pump strokes, and hence the volume sampled through each adsorbent tube.The NIOSH tubes were analysed as follows The front charcoal adsorbent section of each tube was emptied into a vial containing 0.5 0.01 ml CS2 the vial was capped immediately and shaken. One 1 aliquot of the vial contents was injected into a Pye 204 gas chromatograph for analysis, the column temperature being 80 C the detector temperature 200 C and the injection port temperature 110 C. The chromatographic column was packed with 10 w w DC560 on universal support and oxygen free nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 60 ml.min.The flame ionization detector was set to a sensitivity setting of 16X10X1 to give a detectability of 0.01 trichloroethylene. TheCS2 solvent peak did not interfere with the trichloroethylene peak. The results obtained are given below in Table I.
