# A method of manufacturing a MIS type semiconductor device.

## Abstract
In a method of manufacturing an MIS type semiconduc tor device, an impurity region 16 is formed by implanting ions into a substrate 11 using a plurality of implantation energies and dosages, such that the peak of impurity concentration in the region does not exceed the electrically active solubility of the impurity. The impurity region 16 is then irradiated by an energy beam to activate the implanted impurity 16a, 16b without any substantial redistribution thereof.
