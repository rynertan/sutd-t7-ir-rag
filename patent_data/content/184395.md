# PARISON TRANSFERRING MEANS

## Abstract
Parison transferring means for transferring glass pari sons from a mould of a glassware manufacturing machine. A shaft 20 which carries supports 38 for neck rings which can grip or release a parison is turnable back and forth about a horizontal axis 22 to move the neck rings between gripping and releasing positions. The end positions of the arcuate movement about the axis 22 are determined by adjustable stops 70 and 100 which engage projections 42 and 102 of the shaft 20 or of the supports 38 .
