## Description
RADIATION CIJRABLE COATINGS CAPABLE OF lIITUSTAtlDIMC, SEVERE DEFOR4ATION This invention relates to novel polymerizable coating compositions suitable for coating substrates prior to fabrication of the substrates, a process for preparing such coating compositions and to the coated substrates. The present invention provides a radiation curable coating composition which comprises a mixture of a mono unsaturated component and a polyunsaturated component, the mono unsaturated component comprising one or more compounds having one reactive unsaturated carbon linkage and the polyunsaturated component comprising one or more compounds having two or more reactive unsaturated carbon linkages the molar ratio of unsaturated carbon linkages present in the polyunsaturated component to unsaturated carbon linkages present in the mono unsaturated component being below about 0.5, and the coating composition, when applied to a substrate and suitably cured, resulting in a deformable polymeric film having a glass transition temperature of between about 100C and 1000C. The present invention further provides a process for preparing a deformable, radiation cured coating composition which comprises a preparing a blend of mono unsaturated and polyunsaturated compounds such that the molar ratio of reactive unsaturated bonds present in the polyunsaturated compounds to reactive unsaturated bonds present in the mono unsaturated molecules is below about 0.5 the molecular structure of the unsaturated compounds being selected to provide a glass transition temperature in the cured coating of from 100C to 1000C and b exposing the blend to polymerization inducing radiation, in the presence of a substantially oxygen free atmosphere, for a sufficient time to effect a cure of at least 85 by weight of the monomeric un saturated compounds in the coating. It is frequently the practice in the fabrication arts to apply coating compositions to flat sheet material and cure or set the coating prior to forming the flat sheet into a finished fabricated article. For example, in the fabrication of metal bottle caps for soft drink bottles, it is a common practice to coat thin aluminum sheet stock and cure the coating composition before the caps are formed or stamped from the sheet stock using conventional fabricating technology The coated sheet material is usually stockpiled in inventory prior to fabrication to ensure an adequate supply during fabrication operations.Such inventories may consist of stocks of coated substrates in sheet form or in rolls, depending upon whether the fabrication operation requires discrete sheets or continuous webs of the substrate. In order to be useful, coatings for this type of application must be resistant to interpenetration with contact surfaces so as to permit easy unstacking or unrolling of the coated inventory for subsequent fabrication. This undesirable interpenetration phenomenon, which is commonly known as blocking, occurs when two coated surfaces are in contact with one another and refers to their tendency to stick together and form minute welds, thereby greatly increasing the coefficient of friction between the surfaces and at times even causing the coating to adhere more strongly to the adjacent coated surface than to the substrate.In addition, the cured coating must be sufficiently adherent to the substrate and sufficiently deformable to withstand the fabrication stresses and permit fabrication into the finished article without removal from the substrate e.g. peeling or otherwise failing to provide a continuous protective film. It is known that radiation curable coatings may be prepared by blending materials which contain one or more ethylenically unsaturated groups per molecule, such groups being reactive in free radical polymerization mechanisms. The physical properties of coatings made from such blends vary from hard to soft and from ductile to brittle depending upon the relative amount of unsaturation in the blends and the chemical structure pendent to the unsaturated bonds. It is also known that free radical polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated bonds may be inhibited by the presence of oxygen. This inhibition not only materially slows the rate of polymerization, but also produces a product of reduced polymerization chain length. This reduction in chain length manifests itself by a softening of the cured coating and, in extreme cases, can produce a material which is tacky or even wet to the touch.Such undesirable condition makes it difficult to unstack the coated substrate from inventory. A desirable coating then must be adherent to the substrate both before and after fabrication, must be resistant to blocking, and must also be sufficiently deformable or elastic to allow fabrication of a wide range of shapes. The present invention describes the material properties, blends of materials and curing conditions that provide coatings which are desirably adherent, resistant to blocking in the stack, and sufficiently deformable for use on a wide range of fabricated articles requiring severe deformation. Simply stated, the invention comprises a controlling the molar ratio of unsaturated carbon bonds present in polyunsaturated molecules to those present in mono unsaturated molecules, expressed as a decimal fraction which we refer to as the e rho value, below about 0.5 and preferably below 0.2 b selection of molecular structure pendent to the unsaturated sites to provide a glass transition temperature Tg in the cured coating between 100C and 100or, preferably between 150C and 1000C and c the combined use of 1 a chemically inert atmosphere during cure, such as provided by nitrogen gas or by combustion of natural gas to provide an atmosphere substantially free of oxygen, 2 in the case of cure by ultraviolet light, an efficient photoinitiator of free radicals, preferably a blend of photo initiators which exhibit absorption maxima in different regions of the ultraviolet spectrum, such photoinitiators being present in amounts of from about 0.5 to 7 by weight and preferably between about 1 and 5 by weight, and 3 exposure of the coating to actinic radiation or to electron beams to effect a cure of at least 85 by weight of the volatile components in the coating to a non volatile state. The coating compositions resulting from practice of our invention comprise formulations which are a combination of relatively low amounts of high molecular weight resins having low functionality unsaturation with a large proportion of monoethylenic monomer. Such combinations, when formulated in the manner disclosed, will provide a combination of hardness and flexibility which is unusual in a radiation cured coating. Although preferred embodiments of the invention envision utilization of such deformable coating compositions to coat flat, normally rigid substrates which are subsequently permanently deformed or fabricated into normally rigid articles or parts of articles, it is contemplated that the unique compositions of our invention may also be useful as coatings for flexible materials. We have discovered that there is a direct relationship between the value and the adhesive quality of the cured coating film. In general the lower the 5 value the better the adhesion of the coating to the substrate. Coating compositions having a C value below 0.5 have particular utility in coating flexible materials such as metal foils plastic films and paper wrappers. In the manufacture of many useful and desirable articles and containers which must be covered or sealed with a coating to prevent oxidation or other physical or chemical deterioration of the article, e.g.metal cans, or to prevent undesirable contact between the substrate and the contents of the container, e.g.food containers, or simply to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the article, it is frequently the practice to apply the coating composition to the flat substrate and effect its cure prior to fabrication of the article. In the process of fabrication, the substrate, and hence the coating covering its surface, is deformed to alter the shape and or dimensions or the original sheet. This operation results in severe stresses on the cured film.Representative of applications wherein the coating may be applied to the substrate and cured prior to fabrication are containers such as drawn cans, food trays, refrigerator doors, various automotive body parts and molded egg cartons. For successful fabrication the coatings must be adhesive to the substrate after fabrication and be able to withstand the deformation stresses without cracking, peeling or failing in any way. Until now, the design of a successful coating formulation has been a hit or miss proposition wherein very specific combinations would be employed in an attempt to solve very specific application problems on a totally empirical basis. It has been found that by adjusting the molar ratio of polyunsaturated molecules to mono unsaturated molecules in the uncured coating composition to fall within specified ranges, a desirable effect on the physical characteristics of the cured coating film is achieved. This ratio is characterized as the 5 rho value of the coating composition and is herein defined as the molar ratio expressed as a decimal fraction, of unsaturated carbon bonds present in polyunsaturated components of the composition to unsaturated carbon bonds present in mono unsaturated components. For the purposes of this invention, the C value should be below about 0.5, and preferably below 0.2, to result in a desirable cure coating.Particular embodiments may call for their own preferred limit of e . For instance, in order to provide superior adhesion to impermeable substrates such as metal foil and plastics, a P value of below 0.2 is preferred. Also, in applications calling for cured coatings which must withstand very severe fabrication stresses, e values of less than approximately 0.2 are the most preferable. Likewise, if the coated substrate is expected to undergo substantial amounts of stress resulting from flexing, it is essential that the coating possess exceptional adhesion properties as well as good elasticity. It is found that control of Q to below 0.5, and preferably below 0.2, will result in compositions useful in such applications. The unsaturated carbon bonds referred to herein are generally carbon carbon double bonds. Such unsaturation may be terminal or internal, although terminal or ethylenic unsaturation is normally found to be more reactive in polymer cross linking mechanisms and for that reason is preferred. Acrylate unsaturation is especially preferred. Various polyethylenically unsaturated resins are known and readily available and may be utilized in this invention. Thus, hydroxy functional polyesters can be esterified with acrylic acid or condensed withN methylol acrylamide to provide polyethylenic resins useful herein. Similarly, N methylol acrylamide copolymers can be reacted with hydroxy acrylates, such as 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, to provide further polyethylenic resins useful herein. While the foregoing are polyacrylates, the corresponding methacrylate or crotonate 2 butenoate may be used. By substituting norbornene alcohol for the hydroxyethyl acrylate, norbornene ethers can be formed. Other useful polyethylenic resins are based on epoxy resins.For example, a diglycidyl ether of a bisphenol may be esterified with acrylic acid or etherlfied with hydroxyethyl acrylate, forming epoxy based polyacrylic resins. Mumerous other examples of polyunsaturated compounds utilizable herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the field and are included within the scope of polyunsaturated compounds encompassed by this disclosure. In like manner, there is a large variety of mono unsaturated compounds which are useful in the present invention. The monomers preferably contemplated herein are mono functional esters of acrylic acid having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms. The acrylate ester may be an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl acrylate, such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, amyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, octyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, decyl acrylate, dodecyl acrylate, tetradecyl acrylate, or hexadecyl acrylate. Also contemplated are the acrylic esters of the well known class of ether alcohols having the formula ROCH2CH20H wherein R is C1 C6 alkyl or phenyl, i.e. the Cellosolves.Examples of such esters are methoxyethyl acrylate Methylcellosolve acrylate , ethoxyethyl acrylate Cellosolve acrylate , butoxyethyl acrylate Butylcellosolve acrylate , isobutoxyethyl acrylate Isobutylcellosolve acrylate , hexoxyethyl acrylate Hexylcellosolve acrylate , and phenoxyethyl acrylate Phenylcellosolve acrylate . The contemplated reactive monomer can be designated by the formula CH2 CHC O OR, wherein R is C1 C15 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl CH2H40R wherein R is Cl C6 alkyl or phenyl EMI8.1 wherein R and R are C1 C4 alkyl, phenyl, or cresyl EMI8.2 wherein R is as previously defined andEMI9.1 wherein R is C1 C4 alkyl, R is H or C1 C3 alkyl, and x is an integer from 1 to 10. In the case above where R isEMI9.2 the reactive monomer is a carbamoyloxyalkyl acrylate.Compounds of this class are readily prepared by well known methods for preparing carbamates. Thus, a hydroxyalkyl acrylate, e.g. hydroxyethyl acrylate, can be reacted with an isocyanate, e.g. butyl isocyanate, phenyl isocyanate, or cresyl isocyanate to form the carbamoyloxyalkyl acrylate, in the presence of a catalyst, e.g. dibutyltin dilaurate. Alternatively, the carbamoyloxyalkyl acrylate can be prepared by first reacting a hydroxyalkyl acrylate, e.g. hydroxyethyl acrylate, with phosgene in the presence of a base to give a chloroformate intermediate and then further reacting this intermediate with an amine, e.g. ethylamine, butylamine, or aniline, in the presence of a tertiary amine acceptor for HCl, e.g. triethylamine. lffhen R isEMI9.3 the reactive monomer is an alkyl 2 hydroxypropyl ether acrylate. Compounds of this class are readily prepared by the well known addition esterification reaction of acrylic acid with an alkyl glycidyl ether, e.g. butyl glycidyl ether. When R isEMI9.4 the reactive monomer will be a polyoxyethylene ether of alkyl acrylate. Generally, these compounds can be prepared by reacting a hydroxyalkyl acrylate with an alkylene oxide 1,2 epoxyalkane e.g. ethylene oxide, 1,2 epoxypropane, or 1,2 epoxybutane, using a molar ratio of acrylate alkylene oxide of 1 1 to about 1 10, at about 300 750C, and using an initiator such as boron trifluoride etherate. In the specific case wherein the alkylene and the alkyl groups are all ethyl, the acrylate can be prepared by monoesterification of a poly oxyethylene glycol commercially available under the registered trademark Carbowax with acrylic acid or acryloyl chloride. Typical examples of carbamoyloxyalkyl acrylates, alkyl or aryl, 2 hydroxypropyl ether acrylates alkoxy 2 hydroxypropyl acrylates , and hydroxy polyoxyalkylene ethers of alkyl acrylates include butylcarbamoylethyl acrylate, phenylcarbamoylbutyl acrylate, cresylcarbamoylpropyl acrylate, butoxy 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate phenoxy 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate, cresoxy 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxy penta oxypropyl ether of ethyl acrylate, hydroxy deca oxyethylene ether of butyl acrylate, and hydroxy hexa oxybutylene ether of propyl acrylate. A second important element of the present invention is control of the glass transition temperature Tg of the cured coating composition. Acceptable cured coatings are those having a Tg falling within the approximate range of 100C to 1000C, preferably between about 150C and 1000C. Measurement of Tg may conveniently be made by the use of a differential scanning calorimeter, the Tg being defined as the extrapolated onset of softening of the polymerized coating. Control of the Tg may desirably be accomplished by appropriate selection of molecular structure pendent to the unsaturated sites in the mono unsaturated and polyunsaturated components.As a general proposition, unsaturated components having a high degree of linear side chains on the molecular backbone will tend to give rise to coatings having a relatively low Tg, and therefore decreased hardness, compared to unsaturated components having less branching. Conversely, branched or cyclic side chains lead to compounds with a higher Tg, resulting in harder, more brittle films. The Tg is important in that, together with the e value, it determines the mechanical strength of the coating. For instance, coatings which are too low in Tg may fail cohesively during or after fabrication of the coated substrate, while a Tg which is too high may bring about brittle failure of the cured coating. The coating compositions of this invention are cured by exposure to actinic radiation. Ionizing radiation, such as electron beam radiation, may be used, in which case a photosensitizer is not needed. When the radiation is by ultraviolet light, a photosensitizer is needed. Examples of suitable sensitizers include acetophenone, 4 t butyl 2,2,2 trichloroacetophenone, 4 phenoxy 2,2 dichloroacetophenone, benzophenone, xanthone, benzoin isobutyl ether, benzoin isopropyl ether, and 2 chlorothioxanthone. Phenyl ketones are preferred, especially benzophenone. A tertiary amine co sensitizer may also be used in the UV curable coating formulation and serves to speed up the cure rate. In order to realize this function, it is necessary to have free amine present.Accordingly, the amine concentration range is from about 1.25 to about 3 times the amount required to neutralize free acidity. The amount required for neutralization can be readily calculated from the determined acid number of the resin.The tertiary amines are normally liquid trialkylamines, trialkanolamines or tertiary mixed alkylalkanolamines. Examples of such amines include triethylamine, triisopropylamine, tributylamine, trihexylamine, tri 2 ethylhexylamine, tridodecylamine, methyldiethanolamine, dimethyl ethanolamine, 2 hydroxyethyldiisopropylamine, and triethanolamine. It is preferred, in UV curable systems, that a blend of photoinitiators which exhibit absorption maxima in different regions of the ultraviolet spectrum be incorporated into the coating compositions. In this way the rate and uniformity of cure of the coating composition is greatly enhanced. When such blends are employed, it is preferred that the blend include at least one photoinitiator which strongly absorbs ultraviolet light in the region of 2000 to 3000Angstroms. The total amount of photoinitiator utilized should be from about 0.5 to 7 by weight, and preferably between 1E and 5 by weight of the composition. The coating compositions described thus far produce clear coatings and are useful as such. If desired, a pigmenting agent may be incorporated into the coating composition of this invention. In general, the amount of pigment used may be from about 25 to about 60 weight percent, relative to the total weight of the entire coating composition.Ordinarily from 30 to 50 weight percent is sufficient.The preferred pigment is titanium dioxide for white base coats, but any well known pigment or pigment extender can be used, such as zinc oxide, bentonite, silica, ochers, and chrome yellows or greens. Internal lubricants and antiblocking agents may also be incorporated into the coating compositions.The use of such additives has been found to be beneficial as an aid to unstacking of the coated substrates from inventory as well as as an aid in release from fabrication dies. Lubricants such as waxes, polyethylene, hydrocarbon oils and silicones are useful to control and generally reduce the surface coefficient of friction. The coating composition may be applied to any of the usual substrates, such as metal, paper and plastics, which must undergo substantial deformation resulting in significant surface stresses leading to failure adhesive, elastic, etc. of heretofore known and available coatings. The compositions may be applied to the substrates by any of the usual methods of application, such as wiping, spraying and rollcoat application. Suitable metallic substrates include, for example, aluminum, steel, and tin plated steel. The rate of application should be sufficient to apply the coating at about 1 to 20 mg sq.in. After application, the coating is set by exposure to radiation, preferably ultraviolet light or electron beam, for sufficient time to effect a cure of at least 85 by weight of the volatile components in the coating to a nonvolatile state. If ultraviolet radiation is used to cure the coating film, it is preferred that UV light of a wavelength below 4,000Angstrom Units be employed. Electron beam radiation suitable for curing operations may be obtained from high energy electrons produced by high voltage electron accelerators. These are well known and includeVan de Graaff accelerators, resonant transformers, transformer rectifiers, microwave waveguide linear accelerators, and synchrotrons. In the curing operation, it is important that the coating composition be blanketed by an inert atmosphere to exclude molecular oxygen to the extent reasonably possible, since oxygen acts as a free radical scavenger and will have the effect of inhibiting polymerization and resulting in undesirably short polymer chain lengths in the surface of the coating, causing the cured film to be tacky. It is therefore preferred to conduct the curing step in a chemically inert environment, such as provided by gaseous nitrogen or by combustion of natural gas to provide an atmosphere which is substantially free of oxygen. A further improvement and refinement of this invention is provided by subjecting the cured coating to a temperature of from 930C 2000F to 2600C 5000F for a period of 10 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably from 1210C 2500F to 2040C 4000F for from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. The result of such treatment is to provide even greater resistance of the coating to failure during the fabrication step. The elevated temperature treatment may be utilized either before or after the coated substrate is stacked for inventory storage to achieve the desired result.

After formulation each of the coating compositions was applied to a size coated aluminum panel at approximately 3 mg in2. and cured by either UV or electron beam radiation in a nitrogen atmosphere. The cure conditions and film characteristics of the cured coating are reported in Table II. Ultraviolet cure Examples 1 7 was accomplished by passing the coated panel thru the radiation produced by 200 watt Hanovia mercury lamps. The cure rate is expressed in feet per minute of line speed per lamp used fpm L . Electron beam radiation Example 8 is expressed in units of absorbed ionizing radiation dose Mrad, equal to 1,000,000 rads . The tests performed were as follows Tissue Tacking Rating Coatings were drawn down on duplicate 4 x4 metal panels, cured and placed coating surface to coating surface with a single sheet of tissue paper between them. The assembly was then placed under a pressure of 100 pounds 6.25 lb in2 and heated to 490C 1200F for 18 hours. After cooling to ambient temperature the panels were rated for ease of separation from the tissue on a scale of O to 10, with 10 representing perfect and complete separation of the tissue. A rating of at least 8 is normally required as a commercial standard for blocking resistance.Bake Yield The percent by weight of the coating remaining on a metal panel after cure and after baking in an oven at 1770C 3500F for 5 minutes.

The coated side of the panel became the outside of the can.All panels had been baked for 10 minutes at 1490C or 1770C prior to fabrication and fabrication ratings are reported as pass or fail. This test is classified as a high severity situation and represents a very severe drawing operation resulting in unusually high stress on the cured coating.

While fabrication was excellent, the Tissue Tack Rating was only 4 indicating that the coating would probably not be commercially desirable in terms of blocking resistance.Example 2 Demonstrates the effect of increasing the glass transition temperature of the coating by incorporating a second mono unsaturated material in this case QM589 whose structure leads to a higher glass transition temperature in the cured coating. The glass transition temperature is raised to approximately 300C and the Tissue Tack Rating is increased to 6.5 while maintaining acceptable fabrication. Example 3 Demonstrates the value both of increasing photoinitiator level P 1 BZ 3 and the use of a photoinitiator BZ which has a high absorption in the region of 2000 3000 Angstroms. In this instance the Tissue TackRating is increased to 9, providing a completely acceptable product from the standpoint of blocking and fabrication.Example 4 Illustrates the use of alternative structures leading to higher glass transition in the cured coating. In this case NVP was chosen at the 20 wt. level to provide aTg of 300C. A second illustration is also contained in this example, as the P 1 level was raised to 5 . The combination of these two effects provided a Tissue Tack Rating of 9.5 which is fully acceptable. This illustrates the effect which may be achieved by increasing the photoinitiator level within the preferred region of this invention.Example 5 Shows that increasing the 0 value to 0.C888, in this instance by adding 6 wt. of an adduct of Epon 828 and hydroxyethyl acrylate, may be used to improve the TissueTack Rating to the acceptable region while providing excellent fabrication. This addition is accompanied by an increase in Tg which may be ascribed to the higher value. Care should be taken, however, not to increase the Ç value too high, as will be demonstrated in the examples which follow.Example 6 Demonstrates that the t value may be increased by adding an alternate polyfunctional molecule.In this example TMPTA, a trifunctional acrylate, was added at 2 1 2 wt. to a composition similar to that used inExample 3. It is found that the Tissue Tack Rating is increased to a perfect 10 while fabrication is still acceptable even though the 5 value has been increased to 0.1062.Example 7 Included to show that increasing the wt. level of polyfunctional molecules may be used to increaseTissue Tack compare Example 1 with 7 , but that for the fabrication test used, the 5 value of .3437 was too high and led to failure of the coating after fabrication. This coating, however, could be used in a less severe fabrication with excellent results.Consequently, the preferred region of utility of the invention is drawn to include C values up to 0.5 since most applications are, in reality, not nearly as severe as the one used to illustrate the invention. Example 8 Demonstrates two features of the invention. First, that the coating may be pigmented, in this instance with Ti02, and secondly, that electron beams may be used to desirably affect cure of the coating compositions. The product is acceptable from the standpoint of both Tissue Tack and Fabrication.Example 9 The invention calls for the use of a high molecular weight unsaturated resin of low functionality in combination with a relatively large proportion of monoethylenic monomer having a relatively high Tg. The operative controlling variable in determining how much of the respective components is, however, the quantity The actual weight range of the high molecular weight resin and the monomer will depend upon the molecular weight of the resin employed. Table III below illustrates the weight ranges of some typical components as they relate to a given limit of 5 value.
