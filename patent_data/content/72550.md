# A neutron shielding composite fiber and a method of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
The invention relates to new fibrous neutron shielding material in the form of composite or bicomponent fibers having a core and sheath structure, comprising a fiber forming polymer A as the core component, which contains at least 5 by weight of neutron absorbing particles of up to 25 µm, preferably 15 µm and less in diameter, and at least one kind of fibre forming polymer B as the sheath compo nent, said polymer B being compatible with said polymer A . The polymers A and B are preferably polyethylene or copolymers containing a major amount of polyethylene. The neutron absorbing particles contain ⁶Li and or ¹⁰B. The new fibers are conventionally melt spun bicom ponentially, the ratio of the melt viscosities under the spinning conditions being from 0.2 to 0.9 of the sheath polymer to the core polymer. The fibers obtained are highly flexible and do not show any significant generation of secondary radioactive radiation so that they are highly advantageous with respect to being manufactured into protective clothing.
