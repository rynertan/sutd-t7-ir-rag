# Process and apparatus for sampling non homogeneous fluids.

## Abstract
In a process for sampling a non homogeneous fluid, the fluid is passed through a mixing zone 5 in a pipeline 1 for homogenization, whereafter part of the fluid is continuously withdrawn at a velocity substantially equal to the fluid velocity in the pipeline 1 and is collected in a collecting vessel 4. The collected fluid is mixed and a sample is taken from the mixed collected fluid for analysis. The invention further relates to an apparatus for use in the above process.
