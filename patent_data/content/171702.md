Method ii is a preferred method of preparation of compounds of the general formula I .Starting materials of the general formula VIII and IX are either known compounds or can be prepared from known compounds by known processes or processes analogous to known processes.For example, the starting material of the general formula X EMI23.1 in which R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 Y and Z are as defined in relation to formula I may be prepared, for example, by alkylating 6 or 7 hydroxybenzoxazinone with a suitable alkylating agent. This reaction is advantageously carried out in acetone using chloroacetone in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate, preferably potassium carbonate. The preparation of the reaction materialEMI23.2 may be carried out, for example, as described inJ.Chem. Soc., 739,1955. The preparation of the starting materialEMI24.1 may be carried out, for example, as described in SwissPatent Specification No. 308, 193 or C.A. 51, 7424F.A compound of the general formula A or I may, if desired, be converted into another compound of the general formula A or I respectively by a method known per se. For example, an alcohol may be converted into an ester thereof.Where necessary or desired, a free hydroxy, or amino group may be protected by protecting groups customary in the art during preparation of the compounds of the general formula A or I . The protecting groups, may, if desired, be removed by the usual known methods subsequent to the preparation.The present invention extends to novel intermediates and starting materials and thus further provides a compound of the general formula E or a compound of the general formula II , or a compound of the general formula G , or a compound of the general formula VI or VI or a compound of the general formula B when yl represents X2, or a compound of the general formula IX , or, where possible, a salt or reactive derivative thereof. Compounds of the general formulae II , VI , VI , IX and X are useful starting materials or intermediates in the preparation of compounds of the general formula I .The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the general formula A or I may be produced, for example, by treating a compound of general formula I with the appropriate acid.Compounds of the general formula A or I and salts thereof, produced by the above processes, may be recovered by conventional methods.Compounds of the general formula A or I may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent, for example methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent.Suitable optically active acids which may be used as resolving agents are described in Topics inStereochemistry , Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971,Allinger, N.L. and Eliel, W.L. Eds.Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound of the general formula A or I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials of known configuration. For example, one enantiomer of compound 11 when R1 represents methyl may be reacted with one enantiomer of a compound of the general formula III or one enantiomer of compound VIII may be reacted with one enantiomer of a compound of the general formula IX when A1 and A2 do not represent oxo, and R1 represents methyl , to produce a single enantiomer of the general formula I .Analogous processes to the abovementioned processes for the preparation of the compounds of formula A or formula I , or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be used to prepare any of the compounds of the present invention.As previously indicated, the compounds of the present invention hereinafter called the compound have valuable pharmacological properties.
