# Method and apparatus for developing electrostatic latent images.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for toning electrostatic latent images by presenting in very close proximity to the latent image, a thin viscous layer of toner particles carried by an applicator roller with minimal insulating carrier liquid pre sent functioning only to maintain the separate integrity of said particles. The toner particles are electrically separated from the liquid suspension and electroplated onto an applicator roller from which selected particles are contact transferred to the latent charge image carried by photocon ductive surface of an electrophotographic member brought there past. The applicator roller, is positioned closely having a proximate the image carrying surface to define a very narrow virtual zero gap between the applicator roller and said photoconductive surface, with the layer of particle occupying substantially the full gap .
