# Method for preparing poly tetramethylene ether glycol having a narrow molecular weight distribution.

## Abstract
In the preparation of poly tetramethylene ether glycol by the polymerization of tetrahydrofuran THF using a cationic initiator, molecular weight distribution MWD can be held within narrow limits by bringing the THF and the initiator together in a mol ratio such that the degree of polymerization will be at about a minimum and at a temperature which will promote about a maximum number of tertiary oxonium ions, then quickly cooling the reaction mass to 25 C to 25 C, and then adding enough THF to complete the polymerization. When the desired molecular weight and MWD have been reached, the polymerization is quenched and the polymer isolated.
