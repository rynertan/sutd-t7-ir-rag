# A process for the synthesis of ethanol and acetaldehyde using cobalt compounds with novel promoters.

## Abstract
Ethanol and or acetaldehyde are prepared in good yield by contacting methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide with a catalyst system comprising a cobalt containing com pound and a promotor in the presence of an inert oxygen ated solvent at a temperature of from about 50 C to about 350 C and a pressure of at least 35 bar or greater. The combination of cobalt containing compound and promoter may be a a cobalt containing compound with an organo sulphur compound, b an iodide containing cobalt com pound with a nitrogen containing compound as promoter, and c a cobalt containing compound with 1,1 bis diphenylphosphino ferrocene.
