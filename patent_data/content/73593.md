## Description
TITLE SIZE EXCLUSION HETEROGENEOUS IMMUNOASSAY DESCRIPTION Technical Field This invention relates to a novel immunoassay method employing a size exclusion separation step for the measurement of haptens of interest in biological fluids. Background Art Radjoimmunoassays RIAs are widely used in the assay of haptens such as hormones or drugs. In these assays, a known quantity of radiolabelled hapten, the sample containing hapten analyte , and the antibody to the hapten are mixed. Following an incubation period which allows for the competitive binding reaction to occur, the free and antibody bound hapten are separated. The amount of radioactivity in the free or bound fractions is measured to indicate the concentration of analyte in the biological sample. Separation steps employed in RIA include fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate or polyethylene glycol, adsorption to dextran coated charcoal, immunological precipitation with a second antibody, or solid phase separation using analyte coated tubes or analyte covalently attached to beads. These are described, for example, in Enzymes as Immunochemical Labels by Edward T.Maggio in Enzyme Immunoassay, ed. Edward T. Maggio,CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL, 1980, pages 53 70 .These techniques can be laborious to perform, difficult to automate, and often require specialized reagents for each particular immunoassay procedure. A variety of separation techniques has also been applied in enzyme linked immuno sorbent assays ELISA see, for example, United States 3,654,090, issued April 4, 1972 to Schuurs, et al., and in other types of heterogeneous immunoassays. The solid phase separation and immunological precipitation techniques are the separation techniques most commonly used. Size exclusion is well known in biochemistry, clinical chemistry, and immunology but its use as a separation technique in a heterogeneous immunoassay has been limited to an RIA for estrogens in serum Jens Larsen, et al., Methods inEnzymology, Volume 70, Part A, ed. H. Van Vunakis and J. J. Langone, Academic Press, New York, NY, 1980, pages 315 322 . However, radioimmunoassays have several disadvantages including reagent instability, the need for expensive detection instruments, and the safety hazards involved in handling, storing, and disposing of the radioactive material. There is a need for a separation technique which utilizes a multipurpose column useful for the separation of a variety of analytes from their respective antigen antibody complexes and for different immunoassay technologies.There is a further need for a separation technique which is adaptable to automation. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The heterogeneous immunoassay method of this invention for the measurement of haptens in biological fluids comprises the steps of A mixing the fluid suspected of containing the hapten, a nonradioisotopically labelled hapten and an antibody to the hapten B incubating the materials mixed in step A to allow the competitive binding reactions to proceed C passing the incubated mixture from step B through a gel filtration column packed with a material having a fractionation range suitable for the separation of the labelled hapten antibody complex from the labelled hapten and D measuring the amount of the labelled hapten antibody complex eluted from the column. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In heterogeneous immunoassays, a labelled hapten, a sample containing the hapten analyte and an antibody to the hapten are incubated together for the competitive binding reaction to proceed. A separation step is then necessary to separate the hapten and labelled hapten from antigen antibody complexes. The term antigen includes both hapten and labelled hapten. The amount of labelled hapten can then be measured, often in the bound complex fraction, to indicate the concentration of analyte in the sample. The immunoassay method of this invention, utilizing size exclusion separation, offers a technique which provides the separation for all heterogeneous immunoassay techniques where a large molecular size difference exists between the hapten and labelled hapten, on the one hand, and the antigen antibody complex fractions. This separation technique is applicable to ELISA, heterogeneous fluorescence immunoassay, heterogeneous immunoassays based upon cofactor labelled hapten UnitedStates 4,238,565, issued December 9, 1980 toW. E. Hornby, et al. , and enzyme inhibitor labelled hapten United States 4,273,866, issued June 16, 1981 to Houston F. Voss, et al. . A major advantage of this invention is its universal applicability in these four types of heterogeneous immunoassays. Furthermore, the same size exclusion separation column can be utilized in all of these immunoassays. This feature is especially important in facilitating the automation of heterogeneous immunoassays for clinically important analytes such as hormones or drugs. A variety of column materials can be used for the separation of materials on the basis of molecular weight. vThe cross linked dextrans available from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB, Uppsala,Sweden, as the SephadexD, Sephacryl or SepharoseD series , polyacrylamide gels available from Bio RadLaboratories, Richmond, CA, as the Bio Gel P series and agarose gels also available from Bio RadLaboratories as the Bio Gel A series are commercially available. Controlled pore size glass beads CPG , coated with glycerol propylsilane Esee, for example, Regnier, et al., J. ChromatographicSci., Volume 14, 316 1976 1, can also be used as column materials for size exclusion separation. The choice of column material for a particular application depends upon various factors such as exclusion limits, elution speed, mechanical strength of the column material, back pressure generated during the separation, ease of packing, and resolution capability. Many of the available column materials lack the mechanical strength to withstand the pressures exerted during the column packing and elution steps.In applications where the elution is forced, the presence of back pressure can result in leaks if the columns are not made for high pressure. These problems can be avoided by choosing crosslinked column materials especially prepared for mechanical strength and of medium particle size for elimination of back pressure problems. It is also important to process the column materials by removing the fine particle fragments and to properly pack the columns. In gel filtration chromatography, molecules larger than the largest pores of the particles of the column material, that is, above the exclusion limit, cannot penetrate into the pores of the particles and are eluted first at the void volume as they pass through the column in the liquid phase outside of the particles. Smaller molecules can penetrate the particles to varying extent depending upon their size and shape and are eluted in order of decreasing molecular size. Size exclusion chromatography is a special case of gel filtration chromatography in which the column material is so chosen that its exclusion limit is not above the molecular weight of the fraction desired to be eluted at the void volume. A converse requirement of not having undesired fractions eluted at the void volume is that these undesired fractions have molecular weights below the exclusion limit. Chromatographic separation is greatly dependent, among other factors, on column size.Small chromatographic columns are desirable for use in automated clinical systems where reproducibility, ease of manufacture, speed of elution, and cost are primary concerns. Total separation, however, is difficult in these cases since there is little liquid volume eluted between the void volume and the total bed volume. To achieve successful separation of different size molecules, the choice of a column material with the proper fractionation range is very important. Table 1 indicates the fractionation range of some of the available column materials.

Thus, the separation of these two different molecular weight species is practical with most of the column materials listed inTable 1. In the case of enzyme labelled hapten, the molecular weight of the conjugate will primarily be determined by the size of the enzyme. Therefore, size exclusion separations of relatively large enzymes molecular weights greater than 5,000 daltons are more difficult with many of the clinically desirable, small column systems than with systems employing large columns. For example, the separation of a hapten labelled with horseradish peroxidase molecular weight approximately 40,000 daltons from the hapten antibody complex molecular weight approximately 200,000 daltons is relatively difficult using small columns. The use of low molecular weight enzymes, however, enhances the applicability of size exclusion separation to the clinically useful enzyme immunoassays of this invention. Microperoxidase is a small enzyme of molecular weight approximately 2,000 daltons. Conjugates of hapten and microperoxidase can readily be separated from the antigen antibody complexes using th small columns with appropriate packing material. Following the separation of the antigen antibody complexes from the hapten and labelled hapten, the measurement of the quantity of the label in the complex can be carried out by known methods depending on the type of label utilized. The examples which follow are illustrative of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Size Exclusion Fluorescence Immunoassay for Gentamicin A. Preparation of Column The column material, Bio Gel P 10 resin, is washed extensively with distilled water and suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The column material is used in columns designed for use in an automatic clinical analyzer available fromE. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company as the aca .The column is a plastic tube approximately 5.5 mm in diameter and 88 mm long with rubber stoppers at both ends which allow for automatic sample and diluent entry and eluent exit into an analytical test pack.Such an analytical test pack is described inRe 29,725, issued August 8, 1978 toD. R. Johnson, et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference. B. Preparation of Gentamicin FluoresceinConjugate The gentamicin fluorescein conjugate is synthesized by a procedure similar to that described by Watson, et al., Clin. Chem. Acta, Volume 73, 51 1976 . 6.82 mg of gentamicin sulfate available from Sigma Chemical Co., 62 active ingredient is reacted with 5.0 mg of fluorescein isothiocyanate in 10 ml of 0.05 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.0, for two hours at room temperature. 4 ml of the resultant mixture is applied to a Sephadex G 15 column 1.5 x 97 cm and is eluted with the carbonate buffer at a rate of approximately 0.5 ml min with a peristaltic pump. The unreacted gentamicin sulfate is eluted without retardation and the immunoreactive gentamicin fluorescein conjugate is found in the first fluorescent peak. The fractions containing this first fluorescent peak are pooled.Small aliquots of the pool are frozen until ready for use.The conjugate is tested for immunoreactivity with antigentamicin antibodies by chromatograpnically separating the free and antibody bound fluorescence and it is found to be greater than 90 pure. C. Assay Protocol for Serum Gentamicin Gentamicin sulfate standards are prepared by dissolving gentamicin sulfate in water and making dilutions with normal human serum to the appropriate concentrations. 0.050 ml of the human serum containing gentamicin prediluted 10 fold with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 is added to 0.050 ml of antigentamicin rabbit antisera from MilesLaboratories, Inc., prediluted 30 fold with the same phosphate buffer . After a l min incubation period at room temperature, 0.050 ml of the gentamicin fluorescein conjugate 0.001 mg ml in the phosphate buffer is added. After a further l min incubation period at room temperature, the mixture is transferred to an aca microsample cup. The aca automatically performs the addition of the sample to the column and its elution.The sample volume is 0.100 ml, the elution volume is 0.900 ml, and the elution speed is 0.50 ml min. After the elution is complete, 4.0 ml of the phosphate buffer is added for a total of 5.0 ml volume in the aca test pack. The contents of the aca pack are transferred to a cuvette for the measurement of the fluorescence in a spectrofluorimeter Aminco Model SPT 500 . The level of fluorescence observed is a measure of the gentamicin fluorescein antibody complex which is eluted directly through the column. This level is inversely proportional to the quantity of gentamicin in the sample and is given in Table 2. The assay is reproducible coefficient of variation less than 3 at 3.0 g ml . The cross reactivity of the assay is tested with 1,000 jg ml of several closely related antibiotics. The results, shown in Table 3, indicate that the cross reactivity is low and, in Table 4, show that the recovery of gentamicin is good even in the presence of other antibiotics. The data inTable 2 when compared to those of Tables 3 and 4 show some differences in relative fluorescence values due to day to day instrument variations.

A. A 0.050 ml quantity of serum containing theophylline is mixed with 0.050 ml of antibody to theophylline. After a l min incubation period, 0.050 ml of FAD theophylline conjugate 5.6 nM ml is added. After a further incubation period of 1 min, the mixture is transferred to an aca sample cup. A 0.100 ml portion of the mixture from the sample cup is transferred onto a column prepared as in Example I A . 0.900 ml of buffer 0.1 M phosphate, pH 7.2 is used to elute the antibody conjugate complex into the test pack at a rate of 0.5 ml min. Following elution, 4.0 ml of the phosphate buffer is added for a total of 5.0 ml in the analytical test pack. B. The analytical test pack utilized for the cofactor theophylline immunoassay contains 0.070 ml of 10 mg ml theophylline in water in dimples 1 and 2, 0.050 ml of glucose oxidase apoenzyme diluted to 5 nM ml with 30 glycerol water solution and an equal volume of antiglucose oxidase antiserum in dimples 3 and 4, 0.050 ml of 4 aminoantipyrene 3.8 mg ml and horseradish peroxidase 5.2 mg ml in dimple 5, ss D glucose 90 mg in tablet fortn also containing 5 mg polyethylene glycol 6000 in dimple 6, and 0.050 ml of dihydroxybenzene sulfonic acid 33.65 mg ml in dimple 7. The reagents in dimples 1 through 4 are delivered into the test pack at the first reagent addition step followed after 3.5 min at 370C by the reagents in dimples 5 through 7. The amount of FAD theophylline conjugateantibody coupled eluted into the test pack in step A is measured after freeing the conjugate from the complex by the excess theophylline added during the first reagent addition step. The amount of glucose oxidase formed from the conjugate and apoglucose oxidase is measured in a coupled assay with horseradish peroxidase in a rate measurement using a 510 nm filter. The level of observed enzyme activity is a measure of the FAD theophylline conjugate antibody complex which is eluted from the column. This level is inversely proportional to the quantity of theophylline in the sample and is given in Table 7.
