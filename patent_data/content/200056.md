## Description
The present invention relates to methods and kits for detecting nucleic acids, and especially for detecting polyriboadenosine segments such as those found in eukaryotic messenger RNA. Ribonucleic acids RNA are detected in biological samples by a variety of optical and chromatographic techniques. Such techniques do not easily distinguish total messenger RNA mRNA from other forms of RNA such as ribosomal RNA rRNA , transfer RNA tRNA and viral RNA. Tests based upon hybridization detect only specific sequences and not total messenger RNA. Messenger RNA from eukaryotic cells is known to contain 3 terminal polyriboadenosine segments of varying lengths which, in some cases, decrease an average length over the lifetime of the mRNA. Such poly A tails have been removed for research purposes by the reaction of polyribonucleotide phosphorylases PNP enzyme registry number 2.7.7.8 in the presence of inorganic phosphate. Such reactions were for purposes of removing the poly A tail without digesting the message part of the mRNA, whose local internal base pairing or structure cuts off PNP degradation. See, U.Z. Littauer et al., Polynucleotide Phosphorylase , in Various clinical chemistry assays employ ADP and or adenosine triphosphate ATP as either a reagent or as the analyte. Representative assays for ATP as analyte include those described in F.R. Leach, Journal of The ultimate detection in such assays for or via ATP is generally by a light generating ATP dependent enzymatic reaction e.g., the luciferase catalyzed luciferin reaction with ATP or by an oxidation or reduction dependent upon an ADP byproduct e.g., the conversion of NAD to NADH or of NADH to NAD which is dependant upon pyruvate and catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase . No assay is believed to be known which combines the digestion of a 3 terminal polyriboadenosine segment with a phosphorylation to ATP. Additionally, the beneficial effects of coupling these steps by having the ADP phosphorylated as it is produced by digestion have not been appreciated by the prior art. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the determination of polynucleotides having 3 terminal polyriboadenosine segments in a sample which comprises the steps The present invention also provides a kit for the determination of polynucleotides having 3 terminal polyriboadenosine segments which comprises The present invention also provides a similar method and kit wherein single stranded RNA is digested with a phosphodiesterase to nucleoside monophosphates including AMP and the AMP is first phosphorylated to ADP by reaction with myokinase and with a nucleoside triphosphate other than ATP. The ADP is then phosphorylated to ATP and detected as in the other forms of the invention. In this application the following terms are used based on their generally accepted meanings in the field of molecular biology The ends of such Polynucleotide Strands are referred to as the Five Prime 5 ends, where the 5 carbon of the pentose is not linked to another pentose but may bear hydroxyl, monophosphate or other natural or synthetic moieties , or the Three Prime 3 ends, where the 3 carbon of the pentose is not linked to another pentose but may similarly bear hydroxyl, monophosphate or other natural or synthetic moieties . If the method of the present invention is to be used for analyzing endogeneous RNA, the sample should be prepared to separate target RNA from cell wall materials, associated proteins or other extraneous materials by one or more of sonication, filtration, centrifugation or extraction under conditions or in combinations known for isolating cellular RNA such as mRNA. The method of the present invention includes, in some forms, converting certain RNA segments in a sample to nucleoside diphosphates including especially ADP, and converting the ADP to ATP. The ATP is generally then detected. In certain forms of the invention, the co product e.g., pyruvate is detected. For the ATP detected to be a function of the RNA segments degraded, the background values due to endogenous ADP and endogenous ATP should be treated, preferably in one or more of three techniques 1 separating endogenous ADP and ATP and in some cases AMP from the sample before digestion, 2 converting the endogenous ADP and ATP and in some cases AMP to a by product not producing signal e.g., AMP or adenosine before digestion, or 3 determining a background value of ATP due to endogenous ADP and endogenous ATP and in some cases AMP and then subtracting such background value. The first two techniques are described now with respect to sample preparation. The third technique is described below after the discussion of ATP detection. To remove endogenous ADP and endogenous ATP and in some cases endogenous AMP from a sample to be analyzed e.g., a cell extract containing unknown amounts of mRNA , various known physiochemical means may be used. They include extraction, chromatography and precipitation. To convert endogenous ADP and endogenous ATP and in some cases endogenous AMP to a non signal producing byproduct various biochemical means may be used. Such biochemical means include treatment with phosphatase enzymes such as bacterial alkaline phosphatases or calf phosphatase or tobacco acid phosphatase. Such phosphatases may be provided on a column or other solid phase. In any event, the phosphatase should be removed or inactivated before the subsequent digestion step. Alternatively, chromatographic techniques may be used. The sample, optionally after such endogenous ADP and ATP removal, is now ready for digestion with polynucleotide phosphorylase PNP . Such enzyme also called polyribonucleotide phosphorylase can be obtained from a number of sources such as Conditions for the digesting step are, in general, chosen for efficient enzymatic activity in the desired direction many of the enzymes used are capable of catalyzing the reverse reaction whereby ribonucleotides are added to the 3 end of the polyribonucleotide segment . For polynucleotide phosphorylase, this reaction can be illustrated as follows If the conditions at the time of digestion are less conducive to internal pairing e.g., 50 C or higher and or low salt 0.05M or lower , then somewhat more of the mRNA will be digested before the PNP reaches a stable double stranded region, and some of the other RNAs will be digested. Nuclear RNA might be expected to denature at these conditions which are less conducive to internal pairing however, these RNA s contain only part riboadenosine rather than the poly A tails of mRNA . Transfer RNA tRNA has internal pairing segments only 4 5 base pairs long, but has compact structure and methylated sugar residues which stop PNP digestion. In some cases, therefore, only limited additional digestable RNA segments will produce ribonucleoside disphosphates, and only some of the additional nucleosides diphosphates produced are ADP and will therefore lead to a signal. In addition to sample RNAs, either reagent RNAs or reagent 3 terminal RNA segments may be digested in the first step of the method of the present invention. Such reagent RNAs and reagent hybrids of DNA with a 3 terminal RNA segment are described in EP A 200057. As indicated in EP A 200057, the amount of such reagent RNA or reagent DNA RNA present at the time of digestion will be functionally dependant upon a sequence specific hybridization event, and especially a strand displacement event. EP A 200 057 discloses a method for detecting the presence of a predetermined DNA target nucleotide sequence in the nucleic acid of a biological sample. This method comprises An important preferred feature of the present invention is the coupling of PNP digestion with phosphorylation, and preferably in situ phosphorylation, of the ADP produced by digestion bo ATP. Conversion of ADP to ATP usually involves a kinase such as pyruvic acid kinase or PK and an organphosphate reagent e.g., phosphoenolpyruvic acid . The reaction catalyzed by this reaction is irreversible Enzymes that will similarly convert ADP to ATP in the presence of appropriate organophosphate reagents include creatine phosphokinase CPK in the presence of excess creatine phosphate . See U.S. Patent 4,286,057 to Wulff et al. Exemplary references for such enzymes, showing appropriate reaction conditions, include W. D. McElroy and M. A. DeLuca, In some preferred forms of the present invention, the enzymes and reactants for the digesting step and for the phosphorylating step are present together either because of being introduced as a single stored reagent or by being introduced as separate reagents so as to contact the displaced labeled polynucleotide together. Using polynucleotide phosphorylase PNP , creatine phosphokinase CPK and creatine phosphate CP as exemplary, the overall reaction scheme can be wherein inorganic phosphate and creatine phosphate CP are provided in excess. So long as creatine Cr does not build up to an unacceptable degree, the CPK catalyzed second step will be essentially irreversible, driving the first step in the forward direction as well. Normal cofactors and conditions for the analogous PK reaction include Tris HCl pH 8.5 , 2 mercaptoethanol 1 mM, of pyruvate kinase PK 0.4 units ml , 0.1 M phosphate and phosphoenol pyruvate PEP 4.1 mg ml . In some forms of the invention, it is contemplated to digest RNA to nucleoside monophosphates with a phosphodiesterase such as snake venom phosphodiesterase or a ribonuclease, such as a ribonuclease specific for single stranded ribonucleotide segments. The AMP produced can be converted to ADP by the myokinase catalyzed reaction Once ATP is produced by the above steps in an amount functionally related to the amount of adenosine phosphate digested from mRNA or an RNA or DNA RNA reagent, the ATP may be detected in a number of ways, many of which are conventional for the detection of ATP. Exemplary is the luciferin luciferase method described in various references including U.S. Patents 3,933,592 to Preferred reagents and conditions for the bioluminscent ATP detecting step include those described in LKB s U.S. Patents 4,235,961 to Lundin 1980 and 4,246,340 to Lundin et al, 1981 . In the Examples, below, an LKB instrument and LKB reagents were used after the completion of the digestion and phosphorylation steps carried out together . As indicated in the above LKB patents, the bioluminescent reaction can be controlled especially with D luciferin analogs and pyrophosphate to produce a level signal over one minute while a reading is being taken. Because it is frequently desired that such one minute follow initiation of the bioluminescent reaction by a specified interval, it is preferred that one or both of luciferase and luciferin not be introduced into the reaction mixture until such known interval before detection e.g., introduced separately into the luminometer instrument . Numerous other schemes for detecting ATP with AMP as the byproduct are known. They include several cited or discussed in U.S. Patent 4,446,231 to Self 1984 , the relevant disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. The byproduct of such reactions is AMP, in an amount corresponding on a molar bases both to the ATP consumed and to the photons emitted. If further amplification is desired, an enzyme such as myokinase may be present during the detecting step which catalyzes the reaction Still other ATP detecting schemes do not produce AMP as the byproduct. They include reactions which release ADP as the byproduct such as the NAD linked reactions using 3 phophoglycerol kinase and glyceroaldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase. The ADP produced in the digestion step d may also be detected by reaction with phosphoenol pyruvate in the presence of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase LDH and either NADH or NADPH. In such case, the first reaction is again The above is analogous to col. 8 of U.S. Patent 4,446,231 to Self. The above amplification scheme can be accelerated if the pyruvate kinase used is one activated by fructose 1,6 diphosphate FDP such as Other direct or indirect assays for the AMP or ADP produced directly by the digestion step, or for the ATP produced directly or indirectly from such AMP or ADP are described or can be ascertained from the following U.S. Patents Additionally, the ADP produced in the digestion step may be determined directly by chromatography such as HPLC or fast protein liquid chromatography using Pharmacia s FPLC instrument . See G.A. Orr et al., Depending upon which ATP detecting scheme is used, it may be desirable to perform the third detecting step only after the first two steps are completed. This would enable ATP to be accumulated, e.g., in an incubation vessel, and then detected within a consolidated time period, e.g., in a luminometer chamber. In other cases, it may be desired that reagents for all three steps be present together. One may mix the sample with endogenous AMP, ADP and ATP removed or compensated for with PNP, creatine phosphate, CPK, myokinase, luciferin and luciferase. One may also mix the sample with endogenous ADP and ATP removed or compensated for with PNP, phosphoenol pyruvate PEP , NADH, lactate dehydrogenase LDH and fructose 6 phosphate. See U.S, Patent 4,446,231, Example 1, Table 1 for an analogous assay for ADP. In this latter instance, the ADP generated by PNP is phosphorylated to ATP, but the ATP is not detected. Instead, PEP is concurrently converted to pyruvate, and the pyruvate reduces NADH to NAD catalyzed by LDH . The disappearance of NADH is monitored by absorbance at 340 nm or by fluorimetric measurement. The use of subtraction in the present method can be illustrated by the following five cases, each of which can be performed on equal aliquots of a sample Making all five measurements enables any of a variety of values to be determined, e.g. Standard dilution series were prepared for commercially obtained Ap ,A P.L. Biochemicals and Table 2 shows the results of analysis of ribo Ap ₉A at different levels. This Example illustrates differences between three RNAs digested by PNP at 37 C or 50 C. The RNAs were These data show the controllability of which ribonucleotide segments of a sample are digested by PNP through reaction temperature. Reference is directed to Example 2 of EP A 200057. Table 3 summarizes the results of such experiment. The following shows the lack of effect of DNA upon the present RNA detecting method. Calf thymus DNA was treated with base 1N KOH 80 C for 2 hrs. to remove endogenous RNA, neutralized with acetic acid and precipitated with ethanol. 1, 3 and 5 pmoles of 5S rRNA were phosphorylized for 60 minutes at 50 C and the ADP converted to ATP as in Examples 1 and 2 in the absence or presence of 3 ug 150 ug ml calf thymus DNA. ATP was measured by bioluminescence as described above. The results were The following Example illustrates digestion of poly A to AMP, phosphorylation to ATP and detection by bioluminescence. Such techniques can be used in the present method. To 10 ul of a solution of unpurified poly riboadenosine phosphate poly A from Boehringer Mannheim, molecular weight 1.5 million was added 1.0 unit of snake venom phosphodiesterase PDE Worthington . Controls were prepared without PDE. Concentrations of poly A varied from 0.001 to 1.0 mg ml such that the samples had 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 micrograms of poly A each. The reaction volume was increased to 25 ul with 50 mM Tris pH 8.5 , 5.0 mM potassium phosphate, 1.0 mM MgCl₂. The mixture was incubated first at 37 C for 10 minutes, then at approximately 100 C for 2 minutes to inactivate the enzyme. To this was added 20 ul of a solution containing 100 mM Tris pH 7.75 , 2.0 mM EDTA, 125 mM MgSO₄, 313 mM K₂SO₄ 26.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 units pyruvate kinase, and 40 units myokinase both enzymes from rabbit muscle and purchased from Sigma . The reaction volume was increased to 500 ul with 50 mM Tris pH 7.75 and the solution incubated for 10 minutes at 37 C. The amount of ATP produced was determined using the LKB bioluminescence assay firefly luciferase assay on 500 ul of each sample or control and 50 ul of standard luciferin luciferase reagent. Digestion to AMP and subsequent conversion to ATP was observed, as indicated by the following Table. In these runs, CTP was present at 25 umol in the 20 ul solution added after digestion. No effect was seen comparing these with other runs in which no CTP was added. This suggests that sufficient nucleoside triphosphates NTP were present as impurities in various reagents to support or initiate the myokinase reaction. The tubes prepared from 10 ul of 0.001 mg ml poly A and thus 0.01 ug of poly A gave substantially the same bioluminescence values with and without the phosphodiesterase.
