# Lightguide access port.

## Abstract
An access port assembly 10 for a main lightwave transmission fiber 16 is made by machining a notch 26 into it by carbon dioxide laser nibbling to form notch faces 28, 30 which extend into the core region 18 . The end face 32 of a second, receiving fiber 12 is placed in contact with the notch faces 28 to optically couple it to the core 18 of the main fiber 16 . An optical epoxy cement 34 holds the two members in position and matches the index of refraction. A third, transmitting fiber 14 is similarly connected to the main fiber 16 in a second notch and perpendicular to the receiving fiber 12 .
