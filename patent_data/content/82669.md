# Control for building heating system.

## Abstract
A heating system for a building is controlled by a multifunctional microprocessor 122 . Input signals from an external temperature sensor 50 and a sensor 46 connected to the heat exchanger 26 are passed via a limit and decode circuit 130 to the microprocessor 122 which generates separate output signals to the heat exchanger 26 and a circulating means 28 . The microprocessor 122 disables the fuel burner 32 if the temperature of the fluid side of the heat exchanger 26 will be exceeded. There is a regulated power supply circuit 124 , and the microprocessor 122 controls an audible alarm circuit 132 , a safety lockout circuit 134 , and a display circuit 136 . A hot water override circuit 128 is also present.
