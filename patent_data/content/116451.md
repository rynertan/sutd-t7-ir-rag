# Magnetic transducer structure having reduced track width and a method of manufacturing thereof.

## Abstract
A transducer and method are described where track width reducing notches are filled with a nonmagnetic material which is heated to or slightly over its softening temperature but below its melting temperature. Concen trated high pressure at discrete locations is applied to the softened nonmagnetic material too enhance flow thereof into the notches.
