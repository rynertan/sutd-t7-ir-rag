# Busbar arrangement for aluminium electrolytic cells.

## Abstract
An aluminium potline comprises rows of reduction cells with the cells arranged transversely in each row. The invention provides an asymmetric arrangement of busbars 1, 1 , 2, 2 for conducting current from the upstream collector bars 16 of an aluminum electrolytic reduction cell 10 underneath the cell to the next downstream cell 12 in the row. One or more of the busbars is displaced longitudinally of the cell towards the end facing a magnetically dominating neighbouring row of cells. The extent of the displacement is such as to counteract the magnetic field induced by the neighbouring row.
