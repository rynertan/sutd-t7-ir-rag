# Integrated circuit resistance ladder.

## Abstract
A resistance ladder having a plurality of resistance branches in an integrated circuit chip, including a layer of resistive material 10 defining a plurality of discrete linear segments 12 and a plurality of connector tabs 14 extend ing from each of the linear segments at predetermined intervals for defining each resistance branch wherein the layer of resistive material further defines a number of curvilinear segments 16 for connecting the linear segments to provide a continuous resistive material layer for defining said resistance ladder. Each curvilinear segment is approxi mately a segment of a circle. The resistive material layer also defines a plurality of connector tabs 18 extending from each curvilinear segment with the angular separation of the tabs being approximately defined by
