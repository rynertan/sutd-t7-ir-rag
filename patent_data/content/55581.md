## Abstract
A dynamoelectric machine having a multiple of three poles α,β,γ and a corresponding multiple of three brushes A,B,C is disclosed. Each of the poles α,β,γ are wound poles, two α,β of each group of three poles α,β,γ being excited with a constant excitation during normal operation, the third γ of each group of poles being a control pole, excited so as to produce a flux that both varies in magnitude and reverses in polarity. With an input voltage connected to first A and second B brushes of each group of three, an output voltage may be derived from first A and third C brushes in a magnitude determined by the polarity and intensity of the field of the control pole. The machine is also adapted to provide mechanical output power from its rotating shaft 40 and also to accept input power from its rotating shaft 40 . The output voltage obtainable may be varied between zero and the value of the input voltage, and also increased above the input voltage, and decreased below zero, reversing polarity. Means are also disclosed for provid ing regenerative breaking of a motor 114 driven by the output voltage of the machine and returning power to a battery 50 power supply without increasing shaft speed of the machine, by augmenting the flux of a pole to increase the input voltage while maintaining the output voltage constant.
