# GLOW PLUG HAVING A METALLIC SILICIDE RESISTIVE FILM HEATER

## Abstract
A glow plug having a heater member 20 formed by depositing a metallic silicide layer 24 on the internal and external surfaces of a cylindrical ceramic substrate 22 . The metallic silicide layer 24 deposited on the external surface of the substrate 22 is electrically connected to a metal shell 12 which supports one end of the heater member 20 . An axial electrode 36 disposed in the shell 12 is electrically connected to the metallic silicide layer 24 disposed on the internal surface of the substrate 22 and further serves to lock the heater member 20 in the shell 12 .
