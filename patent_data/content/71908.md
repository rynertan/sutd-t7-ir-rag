Representative pathogens which are sensitive to antibiotics I include Straphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhosa Psuedomonas andBacterium proteus. The antibacterials of the invention are not limited to utility as medicaments they may be used in all manner of industry, for example additives to animal feed, preservation of food, disinfectants, and in other industrial systems where control of bacterial growth is desired.For example, they may be employed in aqueous compositions in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 parts of antibiotic per million parts of solution in order to destroy or inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria on medical and dental equipment and as bactericides in industrial applications, for example in waterbased paints and in the white water of paper mills to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. The products of this invention may be used in any of a variety of pharmaceutical preparations.They may be employed in capsule, powder form, in liquid solution, or in suspension. They may be administered by a variety of means those of prinicipal interest include orally, topically or parenterally by injection intravenously or intramuscularly . Such tablets and capsules, designed for oral administration, may be in unit dosage form, and may contain conventional excipients, such as binding agents, for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone fillers, for example, lactose, sugar, cornstarch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol, or glycerine lubricants, for example, magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol, silica disintegrants, for example, potato starch, acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in the art.Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of aqueous or oily suspensions, or solutions, or they may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use.Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose, glucose sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, or carboxymethyl cellulose. Suppositories will contain conventional suppository bases, such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. Compositions for injection, the preferred route of delivery, may be prepared in unit dosage form in ampules, or in multidose containers. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution, at the time of delivery, with a suitable vehicle, such as sterile water. The compositions may also be prepared in suitable forms for absorption through the mucous membranes of the nose and throat or bronchial tissues and may conveniently take the form of liquid sprays or inhalants, lozenges, or throat paints. For medication of the eyes or ears, the preparation may be presented in liquid or semi solid form. Topical applications may be formulated in hydrophobic or hydrophilic bases as ointments, creams, lotions, paints, or powders. The dosage to be administered depends to a large extent upon the condition and size of the subject being treated as well as the. route and frequency of administration the parenteral route by injection being preferred for generalized infections. Such matters, however, are left to the routine discretion of the therapist accordinq to principles of treatment well known in the antibiotic art. In general, a daily dosage consists of from about 5 to about 600 mg of active ingredient per kg.of body weight of the subject in one or more treatments per day. A preferred daily dosage for adult humans lies in the range of from about 10 to 240 mg. of active ingredient per kg. of body weight.Another factor influencing the precise dosaqe regimen, apart from the nature of the infection and peculiar identity of the individual being treated, is the molecular weight of the chosen species of this invention I . The compositions for human delivery per unit dosage, whether liquid or solid, may contain from 0.1 to 99 of active material, the preferred ranqe being from about 10 608. The composition will generally contain from about 15 mg. to about 1500 mq. of the active ingredient however, in general, it is preferable to employ a dosage amount in the range of from about 250 mg to 1000 mg. In parenteral administration, the unit dosage is usually the pure compound I in sterile water solution or in the form of a soluble powder intended for solution. For zwitterionic species described under Structure I, the pH of such solutions typically will correspond to the zwitterionic point however, consideration of individual properties of solubility and stability may require such aqueous solutions to have a pH other than that of the zwitterionic point, for example in the range of 5.5 to 8.2. In the foregoing word description of the above, schematic reaction diagram for the total synthesis of the defined carbapenem antibiotics, it is to be understood that there is considerable latitude in selection of precise reaction parameters. Suggestion of this latitude and its breadth is generally indicated by the enumeration of equivalent solvent systems, temperature ranges, protecting groups, and range of identities of involved reagents.Further, it is to be understood that the presentation of the synthetic scheme as comprising distinct steps in a given sequence is more in the nature of a descriptive convenience than as a necessary requirement for one will recognize that the mechanically dissected scheme represents a unified scheme of synthesis and that certain steps, in actual practice, are capable of being merged, conducted simultaneously, or effected in a reverse sequence without materially altering the progress of synthesis.
