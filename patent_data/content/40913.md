# 23 Keto derivatives of C 076 compounds, their preparation and anti parasitic use.

## Abstract
Derivatives of C 076 compounds, a series of macro lides, in which the 23 hydroxy group of the C 076 molecule is oxidized to a 23 keto group, are novel. The 23 keto com pounds are prepared by selectively oxidizing the suitably protected 23 hydroxy compound using such oxidizing agents as pyridinium dichromate, chromic acid dimethyl pyrazole, chromic acid and chromic acid acetic acid. Alter natively, selective oxidation of the unprotected 23 hydroxy compound may be accomplished by placing the compound in soil. Further reaction of the oxidized C 076 compounds is also possible. The compounds thus produced have pro found anthelmintic, insecticidal, ectoparasiticidal, and acaricidal activity and may be included as active ingredient in suitable compositions for such uses.
