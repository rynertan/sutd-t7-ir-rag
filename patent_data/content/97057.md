# Method of producing human epidermal growth factor.

## Abstract
A human epidermal growth factor is produced by adding particles of an aluminium or magnesium silicate of the formula Z 2 or 6 SiO₂ xH₂O wherein Z is Al₂O₃ or 2 MgO x is the number of water molecules in each molecule of the compound as governed by the water content of the compound to human urine under neutral to acidic conditions to thereby adsorb the factor on the particles and, then, eluting the factor with an alkaline solution.
