# Meter data gathering and transmission system.

## Abstract
A utility data gathering system is disclosed as comprising a register including a series of index members coupled to a meter mechanism. Each index member includes a plurality of contacts and a switch arm moveable with its index member. The meter mechanism is responsive to utility consumption for moving the index members to positions indicative of the utility consumed, whereby each switch arm completes in normal op eration a circuit with just one of its plurality of contacts de pendent upon the position of its index member. A digital com puter is programmed for performing first and second scans of each contact of each index member to obtain corresponding first and second sets of data indicative of a completed circuit through the switch arm and contacts of each index member. The completed circuit data obtained from each of the first and second scans are compared and if the circuit data of the first and second scans are different, an alarm manifestation is gen erated.
