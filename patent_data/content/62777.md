# OCR AND BAR CODE READER USING AREA ARRAY

## Abstract
An electronic scanner scans both bar code characters and alphanumeric characters producing a set of electrical signals. The electrical signals are examined by both a alphanumeric optical character reader and a bar code reader and the system outputs a signal indicative of what is read by either the bar code or alphanumeric reader but not both.
