# A polyester multifilament yarn and a process for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A polyester multifilament consisting essentially of a filament groups I and II . The filament group I is composed of a polyester selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephtha late and polytetramethylene terephthalate, and or a blend and or copolymer comprising at least two members selected from the polyesters. The filament group II is composed of a substrate composed of a polyester selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate and polytetramethylene terephthalate, and or a blend and or a copolymer comprising at least two mem bers selected from the polyesters and at least one polymer selected from the group consisting of styrene type polymers, methacrylate type polymers and acrylate type polymers, which is added to said substrate in an amount of 0.4 to 8 by weight based on the substrate.
