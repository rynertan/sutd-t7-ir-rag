## Description
Valve The present invention concerns a valve comprising a valve body with a flow passage into which a closure member, such as a disc or a ball calotte without a flow passage, is rotatably fitted on a pivot shaft and, when necessary, sealing members are positioned between the closure member and the valve body. The object of the present invention is to produce flow attenuation in butterfly valves or other valves having a closure member but no flow passage . According to the present invention a valve is characterised in that at least one attenuator plate is arranged spaced apart from one side of the closure member, the plate being provided with a pluxalitypf apertures. The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a section of a butterfly valve with flow attenuator seen in the longitudinal direction of the pivoting shaft of the closure member with the closure member partly open. Fig. 2 is a corresponding section with the closure member in the closed position Fig. 3 is section of a valve similar to Fig. 1 but provided with flow attenuator and a ball calotte closure member shown partly open and Fig. 4 is a corresponding section with the closure member in the closed position. The butterfly valve shown in Figs. 1 and 2 comprises a valve body 1 having a circular cross section flow passage 3, a rotatable closure member or dise 2 baving a stem or pivot shaft 8 being fitted into the valve body 7. The pivot shaft 8 is fitted in the centre of the flow passage 3 and is attached by bearings on both sides of the valve body 1. The disc 2 is fitted on the side of the shaft 8 as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. An annular groove 4 is formed in the wall of the flow passage 3 at one end of the valve body 1, the groove 4 being near to the line of disc 2.A seal 6, which may be of U shaped cross section, is fitted into the annular groove 4, the U shaped seal being positioned to open towards the base 7 of the groove 4 the other edge of the groove 4 is formed by a support ring 5 which is fitted thereinto as shown in Fig. 1 and 2. Such a butterfly valve has been disclosed in Finnish Patent No. 54536. A punched attenuator plate 9 is fitted on the upstream flow side of the disc 2 and three punched plates 9 are arranged on the downstream flow side of the disc 2. The number of plates 9 on both sides of the disc 2 can be varied. All the plates 9 are arranged in relation to the pivot shaft 8 of the disc 2 so as to form a constant radius of revolution. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2 the plates 9 are in parallel spaced apart relationship with the disc 2. Boles are provided in the disc 2 and the plates 9 through which fastening bolts 10 are located. The plates 9 and the disc 2 are held spaced apart by means such as bushings 11. The plates 9 do not have to be mutually parallel nor do they have to be parallel with the disc 2, moreover the plates do not have to be plane, they can be curved for example. The plates can be formed of rods or wires to constitute a net. In the embodiment shown in Figs. I and 2 the plates 9 are perforated with a plumlity of holes 12 over their entire area. When more than one plate 9 is provided in the valve, it is advantageous that the holes 12 are not situated face tQ face in the juxtaposed plates 9. Suitably, the size of the holes 12 increases with the distance of the plate 9 from the disc 2. When the valve shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is opened, the attenuating effect of the plates 9 is high at the beginning, but the more the valve is opened, the smaller is the attenuating effect of the plates 9, for then the proportion of the fluid flowing past the plates 9 increases. Whilst being in the open position, the plates 9 no longer attenuate but are in the direction of the flow allowing the valve to function almost to full capacity. Figs. 3 and 4 show en alternative embodiment of valve construction in which the closure member 2 of the valve 1 is a ball calotte and the attenuator plates 9 are situated only on one side of the closure member.In this embodiment the same reference numbers as used as in Figs. 1 and 2 but with apostrophes. This valve operates in the same manner as the one shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
