# COEFFICIENT WEIGHTING FOR CTD TRANSVERSAL FILTERS

## Abstract
Coefficient weighting in split electrode, Charge Transfer Devices CTD s is improved by connecting only the signal bearing segment 16, 19 of each sense electrode to a sense bus. The remaining segment 17, 18 is connected to a neutral bus C .
