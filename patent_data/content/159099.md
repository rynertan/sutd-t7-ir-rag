# MULTI STAGE AMPLIFIER WITH FREQUENCY COMPENSATION

## Abstract
A multi stage amplifier 21 has three or more amplifier stages A1, A2 and A3 arranged in a capacitatively nested configuration for frequency compensation. The technique consists of nesting two of the stages A1, A2 together with a pole splitting capacitor C1 to forms stable device 11 and then nesting this device and a third A3 of the stages together with another pole splitting capacitor C2 to form the amplifier 21 .
