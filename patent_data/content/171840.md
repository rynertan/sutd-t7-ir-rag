## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ARYLALKANOIC ACIDS BY OXIDATIVEREARRANGEMENT OF ARYLALKANONES This invention relates to a process for preparing an arylalkanoic acid which comprises the addition of iodine to a mixture of an arylalkanone and an excess of an orthoester, heating of the reaction mixture, the addition of an inorganic base and finally of an acid. More particularly, this invention relates to the preparation of an arylalkanoic acid according to the following reaction diagram EMI1.1 wherein X is H or a C1 C4 alkyl radical, andAr is selected from the group comprising an aryl, a substituted aryl, a fused heterocyclic aryl, a heterocycle, a substituted heterocycle and a fused aryl heterocycle radical. It is known that many arylalkanoic acids are useful as drugs and others as intermediates. More particularly many members of this class are known to be useful as anti inflammatory, analgesic, and antipiretic agents. Examples of these compounds include Thiaprofenic acid, Ibuprofen, Fenclorac, lndoprofen, Flurbiprofen, Naproxen, Ketoprofen, Fenoprofen, Piroprofen,Suprofen, Aclofenac, Xenbucin, Diclofenac and Tolmetin Antiinflammatory Drugs, Springer Verlag, 1979, pages 321 3 andIsoprofen, FLP 58,302 CAS 58282 60 3 , Furofenac, Cicloprofen, Y 8004 Drugs of the Future 2, 217 1977 , Caroprofen,Benoxaprofen, Y 9213 Drugs of the Future 4, 373, 1978 ,Enprofen, Benzofenac, Fenclofenac, Isoxepac, Oxepinal, Tiopinac, Zomepirac, and Fentiazac. Because of the great interest assumed by arylalkanoic acids, in recent years research has been intensified to find a preparation method which would make it possible to manufacture the acids of Formula 11 starting from unexpensive compounds such as the ketones of Formula I in a single vessel and without isolating and purifying intermediate products if any. A first attempt is the one described in U.S. Patents Nos.4,107,439, 4,135,051 and 4,412,054, which require the use of trivalent thallium nitrate. This process suffers from many draw backs but the main one is that it gives rise to highly toxic by products which do not allow the use of arylalkanoic acids thus prepared as pharmaceuticals. S.D. Higgins and C.B. Thomas J.C.S. Perkin Trans, 1982, 235 42 idem, 1983, 1483 88 put forward various hypotheses about the mechanism of said reaction for the purpose of replacing thallium nitrate with nontoxic and more economical reagents and, to check the correctness of their hypotheses, they tested various oxidazing systems the best yields are given by the system consisting of iodine, silver nitrate, trimethylorthoformate and methanol but the authors themselves acknowledge that the large quantity of silver nitrate required makes this process uneconomical ibid, 1982, 239 and that the reaction does not proceed at all in the absence of silver nitrate ibid, 1983, 1483 . In European Patent Application No. 108.442 a method is described according to which the silver nitrate is substituted by zinc chloride but the yields obtained with this method are rather small. It has now been found that the system described by S.D. Higgins et al. affords excellent yields even in the absence of silver nitrate and methanol provided a substantial excess of alkylorthoformate or other orthoesters is used. This invention relates to a process for preparing an arylalkanoic acid of Formula II which comprises the addition of iodine to a mixture of an arylalkanone of Formula 1 and an excess of an orthoester, heating of the mixture thus obtained, the addition of an inorganic base, and finally the addition of an acid. To the reaction mixture may be added a suitable solvent, a diluent and or a catalytic quantity of a protic acid. The iodine is added in the amount of approximately 1.05 mole for each mole of arylalkanone. The quantity of iodine used may be substantially reduced by adding a suitable oxidant which restores the iodine from the hydriodic acid which is formed in the course of the reaction. It has been also noted that the presence of a peroxide plays an important role in the kinetics of the process which, for the more reactive systems, is expressed with a considerable reduction in reaction times while in less reactive systems or those which interact with hydriodic acid it is expressed by appreciable increases in yields.Examples of suitable oxidants are hydrogen peroxide, the organic peroxides, preferably the diacylperoxides such as dibenzoyl or dodecanoyl peroxide, the peracids such as m chloroperbenzoic and permaleic acid, the peresters such as tert butyl peracetate, tert butylperbenzoate, di tert butylperoxalate, di tert butylperisobutyrrate, and di tert butyl cyclohexylpercarbonate and the hydroperoxides such as, for example, tert butylhydroperoxide and cumylhydroperoxide. The orthoester is added in the amount of at least 2 mole for each mole of arylalkanone the addition of quantities between 1 and 2 mole gives smaller yields while the addition of more than 10 mole does not give appreciable advantages. Suitable orthoesters are the alkylorthoformates, the alkylorthoacetates and the alkylorthocarbonates in which the alkyl has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The presence of a solvent, a diluent and or a catalytic quantity of a protic acid is not strictly necessary. The addition of a solvent or a diluent is nevertheless useful when the arylalkanone is not very soluble in the orthoester or when it is not very reactive at the boiling temperature of the orthoester. Examples of solvents which increase the solubility of the arylalkanone in the reaction mixture are the aliphatic alcohols and glycols with 1 10 carbon atoms. Selection of the aliphatic alcohol. and orthoester will preferably be made in such a way that the alcohol corresponds to that used as a precursor of the orthoester. When a glycol is used it is preferable to operate in the presence of the corresponding orthocarbonate. When the arylalkanone reacts slowly at the boiling temperature of the orthoester it will be preferable to add an inert organic diluent having a high boiling point such as for example benzene, toluene, xylene and nitrobenzene. The addition of a protic acid is also useful to bring the arylalkanone into solution. Examples of suitable protic acids are hydrochloric, sulfuric, p toluenesulfonic and methansulfonic acid. According to this invention a mixture of an arylalkanone and an orthoester and, optionally, a solvent, a diluent and or a protic acid is refluxed until it becomes clear. This occurs in between 5 minutes and 24 hours. Iodine is then added at a temperature comprised between room temperature and the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture and, when the quantity of iodine is less than 1.05 mole for each mole of arylalkanone, an oxidant is also added. The reaction mixture is then again heated to reflux until a sample of the reaction mixture reveals the presence of the keto group when treated with an aqueous solution of 5 hydrochloric acid. The time required for the keto group to disappear varies with the reactivity of the arylalkanone and the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture and can thus vary between one half hour and 170 hours. When the reaction is over the excess iodine is destroyed by adding a reducing agent such as sodium sulfite, sodium hydrosulfite and sodium thiosulfate and an inorganic base is added. Examples of suitable inorganic bases are sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The mixture thus obtained is again heated to boiling for from 30 minutes to six hours. Water is added, the mixture is acidified and the desired arylalkanoic is isolated with high yields. Said isolation is performed with the usual techniques such as filtration, extraction with solvents, or fractionated distillation. The above process is carried out in a single vessel without isolating any intermediate product. The iodine may be recovered in the form of alkyl iodide by distillation or in the form of iodine by oxidation of the mother liquors, for example with chlorine or sodium hypochlorite. The solvents and or the diluents are also easily recoved by fractionated distillation. The process according to this invention thus makes it possible to prepare the arylalkanoic acids of Formula II in an extremely economical manner because high yields are obtained, because economical or in any case readily recovered raw materials are used, and because the process is carried out in a single vessel with no particular employment of labour. The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting it.
