BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION a Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a magnetic bubble memory module and particularly to a mag netic bubble memory module which is suitable for thinning and miniaturizing its body lowering con sumption and ameliorating efficiency of composi tion. b Description of the Prior Art The magnetic bubble memory module realized in these years has the structure wherein an x coil and a Y coil for generating a revolving magnetic field which are respectively composed of square solenoid coils having non symmetric structures with each other are respectively inserted to E like sub strates made of ceramic, synthetic resin or the like mounting a magnetic bubble memory chip and are arranged at a right angle with eadh other. The X coil and the Y coil must be provided around not only a magnetic bubble memory chip but also a substrate which is far larger than the chip. Thus, The length from one end of each coil to the other end thereof is made longer and thus the driving voltage and the power consumption are made larg er.Furter, the X coil and the Y coil supply a uni form and stable in plane revolving magnetic field to the magnetic bubble memory chips and thus re spectively require a uniform inductor balance. Thus, these coil forms are respectively required to have non symmetric structures which are different from each other and to have large structures. Moreover, these coils respectively have the struc ture wherein there are arranged on the outside surfaces of the X coil and the Y coil a pair of permanent magnetic plates for supplying vertial bias magnetic fields to each magnetic bubble memory chip and the plates for homogenizing their magnetic fields and these peripheral portions are covered with resin molds.

The case RFS is formed by working two dependent plates and the upper and the lower plates are electrically connnected at the side sections of the case. In this caseRFS, there is formed a drawn section around the case so as to narrow a gap of a central part in a somewhat wider range than the part on which the chip CHI is disposed. This drawn section can be utilized for positioning a magnet stated after. The case RFS has two effects, that is, functions of confinig a revolving magnetic field and mechanically supporting a weak substrate FPC. Between the case RFS and the chip CHI, there exists a gap SIR especially at the sides of the chipCHI. However, silicon resin is coated on or filled with this gap SIR together with a plane section so as to try to bring about a passivation effect for the purpose of avoiding attaching extra things on the main surface of the chip when assembling the case and of lessening invasion of water on the main surface of the chip or the side sections thereof after assembling it.

Features of the overall structure Figs. 1 and 2 It is possible to list the features of the magnetic bubble memory module shown in Figs. 1 and 2 as follows. However, the features of the present cmbodiment should not be defined as follows. The other features will be obvious from the descriptions stated after Fig. 3, but, herein, the features are referred as mainly taking relations among respective components. 1 Since the magnetic circuit PFC for gen erating a revolving magnetic field is made to be a picture frame type and the bubble memory chip CHI is arranged to be on the almost same level with the picture frame and within the frame, the thickness of the overall bubble module can be made thin. In the current techniques in these days, the X and Y coils are provided around the upper and the lower surfaces of the chip. Thus, the thickness of the overall device is a function of a sum of a chip thickness, a X coil thick ness and a Y coil thickness. 2 Since the X coil and the Y coil are dis posed on the almost same level with each other, the following effects can be brought about in comparison with the conventional structure wherein the Y coil is provided ar oud the X coil. 1 The length of total windings of a coil is not made so longer. Thus, it is possible to lower inductance L and to realize the lowering of a driving voltage and power consumption. 2 Since the distances between the chipCHI and the X coil and between the chipCHI and the Y coil are made to be equal to each other, it is possible to take a balance of a distribution of a magnetic field amelioration of uniformity . 3 The magnetic circuit PFC for generating a revolving magnetic field is surrounded by the case RFS. Thus, the leakage of a magnetic flux can be hardly brought about and thus it is possible to heighten driving efficiency in relation to the chipCHI. 4 The case RFS has selectivity, that is, it serves to prevent leakage of an alternating magnetic field generated in the coil COI for generating a revolving magnetic field to the magnet body BIM with large permeability X and on the contrary not to prevent substantial passage of a series magnetic field in the bias magnetic fieldHb to be added from the magnet bodyBIM to the chip CHI. 5 The case RFS employs harder materials such as copper in comparison with epoxy glass or the like conventionally utilized as a substrate. Thus, it is possible to mechanically, that is, strongly support the chip CHI. Accordingly, in case of employing a plural chips mounting arrangement on account of raising a producing vield, the difference of a gradient between the chips serves to greatly influence a mag netic characteristic, but the present embodiment can suppress the difference of a gradient between the chips low. 6 Since the flexibility substrate FPC is employed as a substrate, the following effects can be obtained.1 The substrate thickness can be made small.2 This embodiment can employ a lead bonding method. Thus, it is, possible to make the thickness of the bonding portion smaller in comparison with the conventional wire bonding method.3 The above stated effects 1 and 2 serve to make a gap of the magnetic circuit the part with small permeability U smaller and to employ the magnet plate MAG having a small thicknes or a small plane area. They can be brought to thinning the overall module or reducing a plane area.4 It is possible to freely bend wirings from the chip CHI. Thus, it is possible to turn a terminal section out about 180O and to restrict the plane area of the overall module.5 It is possible to diminish in size the width of an opening for picking up wirings of the case RFS for confining a revolving a magnetic field. Thus, the leakage of a revolving magnetic field can be minimized. 7 The outer lead out wirings of the substrate FPC are aggregated at the corner sections of the square. Thus, it is possible to provide an opening of the case RFS for confining a revolving magnetic field at the corner section which is least influenced. 8 Since the function of the inclined plateINN does not have both functions as a magnet and homogenizing a magnetic field, the following effects can be brought about. t It is possible to employ materials with excellent workability such as copper or the like in order to form a gradient.2 It is possible to employ materials with excellent thermal conductivity such as copper or the like and to efficiently dissipate the heat generated in the coil COI for generating a revolving magnetic field.3 By using non magnetic materials, it is possible to prevent disturbance of a magnetic field passed through the plate HOM for homog enizing a magnetic field. 9 It is preferable to thin the inclined plateINN as much as possible in order to diminish a magnetic gap. By restricting the width of the plate INN so as to be a required and sufficient value for forming a gradient more than those of the magnet plate MAG and the plate HOM for homogenizing a magnetic field, the formation of a gradient in a thin plate can be facilitated. 10 The inclined plate INM made of materials with large permeabilityU such as ferrite or the like is inserted between the magnet plate MAG and the shield caseSHI. Thus, it is possible to bury a magnetic gap therebetween. Further, the plate INM can contribute beat dissipation. Since the plate INM employs the material with smaller retentiveness than that of the magnet plate MAG, it is possible to keep an effective thickness of the permanent magnet as an uniform state. 11 The shield case SHI is composed of magnetic materials with large permeability U such as Permalloy or the like. Thus, it is possible to diminish magnetic resistance of the magnetic circuit having the magnet plate MAG as a magnetic field source. As a result, the thickness of the magnet plateMAG and the plane area thereof can be made smaller. 12 The shield case SHI is composed of magnetic materials with large saturated flux density Bs. Thus, it has a function of bypassing a magnetic noise from the outside and preventirgi transmission of it to the chip CHI. 13 The above stated respects 11 and 12 brings to thinning the thickness of the shield case SHI. 14 The shield case SHI employs as its material an iron nickel alloy such as Permalloy. Thus it is suitable for bending operations and serves to protect the parts incorporated therein from mechanical extermal force. 15 Since the magnetic circuit PFC for generating a revolving magnetic field and the bias coil BIC are formed as core types, the accomodating efficiency or the mounting density in the case RFS, SHI orPKG can be made higher. 16 Since the case RFS is inserted between the core COR and the plate HOM for homogenizing a magnetic field, the interval therebetween can be minutely arranged by the thickness and the bending angle of the case for confining a revolving magnetic field RFS in addition to the thickness of thq coil COI. As this interval is made shorter, the overall plane area can be made smaller. This can lead to lower ing power consumption by means of re ducing coil length. However, in case the interval is too short, the series bias mag net field Hb emitted from the magnet plate MAG is leaked to the core COR with high permeability. As a result, the uniformity of the bias magnetic field around the chip is deteriorated. Accordingly, this interval is very important to the above stated char acteristics.According to the present struc ture, it is possible to minutely arrange the interval. 17 The drawn section is provided around the case RFS for confining a revolving magnetic field. Thus, it is easy to accom plish positioning of the magnet body BIM. 18 The two inclined plates INN manufac tured under the same manufacturing con ditions with each other are disposed so as to have 180O of rotation angle difference between the upper and the lower surfaces on the plane. Thus, it is possible to posi tion in almost parallel a pair of plates for homogenizing a magnetic field HOM and a pair of magnets MAG disposed upwar dly of and downwardly of the chip.

Namely, as shown inFig. 4A, the lead wire 9a of the connecting section 3a is disposed at the left upper part of the opening 4a The lead wire 9a of the connecting section 3b is disposed at the left lower part of the opening 4b.The lead wires 9a of the connecting section 3c are disposed at the right upper part of the opening 4a.The lead wires 9a of the connecting section 3d are disposed at the right lower part of the opening 4b. And this substrate FPC is constructed so as to easily discriminate those patterns by looking through the cover film 10, because, in the step stated after, respective connective sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d are combined for engagement, as shown inFig. 4B by bending respective sections to be bent 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d and respective outer terminals 9b,9c on which the soldering layer 13 is formed are exposed to the surface and further, the surfaces of the lead wires 9a, the note 9d and the index mark 9e are covered by the cover film 10. Under this construction, the substrate FPC employs a polyimide resin film and is constructed to have a windmill like form providing respective connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d through respective sections to be bent 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d at the four corners of the chip loading section 1. By constructing the outer terminal sections by bending and engaging these connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d with one another, the chip loading section 1 and the connecting sections are made to have twolayered wiring structures. Thus, without diminishing the area of the connecting sections 3, the area of the chip loading section 1 is made larger and at once the outer terminal section can be made to have plural terminals. Accordingly, the overall form can be minimized. Further, under the above stated construction, it is possible to greatly shorten the lead wires 9a from respective outer terminals 9b to respective openings 4a, 4b of the chip loading section 1.Thus, the influence caused by an external noise and the like can be greatly diminished. It means that it is possible to input and output a signal with a high SIN ratio. Further, by providing the projection 6 at one end of the connecting section 3c and at once the index mark 9e at this projection 6, this index mark can facilitate the discriminations for indicating the central part of the substrate in case of bending and engaging these connecting sections positioning in case of combining the substrate with the cases RFS and SHI refer to Fig. 2 , distinguishing a king of the lead wires 9a from another or indicating a production model or the like. Con sequently, it is possible to rationalize assembling, controlling a substrate and the like. Further, by providing the openings 5a, 5b, 5c at both ends of the chip loading section 1 of the substrate FPC, it is made to be easy to distinguish the right of the substrate FPC from the left thereof, position the chip CHI and the like and similarly it is possible to rationalize assembling efficiency. Substrate assembly Figs. 5, 6 and 7 Fig. 5 is a plan view showing the construction wherein the chip CHI is loaded on the above stated substrate FPC. In this figure, two chips CHI are loaded on the chip loading section 1 of the substrate FPC as disposing them between the openings 4a, 4b in parallel so as to complete the substrate assembly BND. One of the chips CHI is constructed by integrating two blocks of 1 Mbit as shown in an enlarged plan view of Fig. 6. Thus, two chips CHI have four blocks, that is, totally compose a 4 M bits chip. Further, in one block of the chipCHI shown in Fig. 6, a large line shows a conductor pattern and a thin line shows a chevron pattern propagation path.The chip CHI xhown in Fig. 5 is loaded by means of the lead bonding using Au Sn eutectic crystal caused by a pressure melding method as disposing a gold bump 15 between respective bonding pads 14 provided by goldplanting at the end of the chip CHI and the wiring leads 9a on which the tinning layer 11 is formed in the opening 4 of the substrate FPC as respectively shown in enlarged sectional views of Figs. 7A and 7B. According to the above stated construction, it is possible to fixedly support the chip CHI by connecting the lead wires 9a in the openings 4a, 4b of the substrate FPC with the bonding pads 14 of the chip CHI by means of the lead bonding using Au Sn eutectic crystal. Accordingly, it is possible to greatly ameliorate strength for connection and thin the construction. Further, the surface of the chip CHI is covered by the chip loading section 1 of the substrate FPC. Thus, the surface of the chip CHI is protected and at once it is possible to ameliorate handling efficiency and to hold mechanical strength of the substrate FPC.Moreover, according to the above stated construction, since each chip CHI consists of two blocks and two chipsCHI are composed of 4 blocks, respective blocks can be distributively connected to respective connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d which are the closes to respective blocks and thus the symmetric position of the chips CHI can be obtained so as to extremely facilitate a test, a check and the like.Further, since the substrate FPC provides four connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, it is possible to give and receive an input and an output signals having least noise by means of separating wirings for magnetic bubble detectors DET, map loops of each chip CHI and the like from the other wiring functions and aggregating them at one connecting section refer to Fig. 6 and selectively disposing this connecting section at the location which is far away from a noise generating source. Driving magnetic circuit Figs. 8 and 9 Fig. 8 shows the magnetic circuit PFC. Fig. 8A is a perspective view. Fig. 8B is a plan view showing the driving magnetic circuit. In these drawings, in the magnetic circuit PFC, a coil COI composed of four coils 20a, 20b, 20c and 20d by providing wirings in the arrow direction are provided on the parallel sides facing to each other of the picture frame type of core COR made of soft magnetic materials and a X coil 22a is composed by accomplishing series winding of the coils 20a and 20b on the sides facing to each other by way of a contact 21b and a Y coil 22b is composed by accomplishing series winding of the coils 20c and 20b by way of a contact 21a.And, by supplying the X coil 22b and the Y coil 22b with currents Ix and ly whose phase difference is 900 for example, triangular wave current , as shown in Fig. 8B, leakage magnetic fields Hx and Hy are respectively generated in the x axial direction and in the y axial direction so as to supply the above stated two chips CHI with them as a revolving magnetic field. Further, the magnetic circuit PFC constructed as stated above is completed by the step of, as shown in a perspective view of Fig. 9, providing windings in a rectangular parallelepiped like magnetic core 23 made of one soft magnetic material and a tap 24 at each plural blocks, forming a pair of coils, for example, a pair of X coils 22a composed of the coils 20a, 20b, by accomplishing series winding and providing a wider groove 25 and a less wide groove 26 respectively having fixed widths between respective coils 20a and 20b by means of cutting work, afterwards, engaging the wider grooves 25 divided into two parts at the center of this less wide groove 26 with each other rectangularly and attaching them so as to buildup a picture frame type of core as shown ia Fig. 8.Further, reversely, the rectangular parallelepiped core 23 forming the above stated wider groove 25 and less wide groove 26 in advance can provide the coil 20a and the coil 20b by way of the tap 24 so as to form a pair of X coils 22a. Moreover, the above stated pair of Y coils 22b can be formed quite similarly with the X coils. Under the construction stated above, since the rectangular parallelepiped core 23 provides the coils 20a, 20b as providing the tap in the series direction, in case of completing the construction by assembling as shown in Fig. 8, there is no need to connect lines contact as crossing them with each other and thus it is possible to simplify winding. According to the construction stated above, since the X coil 22a and the Y coil 22b are made to be symmetric, coarse coupling is brought aboutThus, it is possible to ameliorate an inductance balance and to prevent magnetic interference among magnetic materials in relation to a leakage magmetic field. Moreover, this magnetic circuitPFC is made to have a picture frame type of structure and thus is not disposed on the upper or the lower surface of the chip CHI. Thus, the thickness in the lamination direction is made smaller and thus the thinning of the circuit can be realized. Case for confining a revolving magnetic field Figs, 10, 11 and 12 Fig. 10 shows the inner case RFSb. Fig. 10A is a plan view. Fig. 10B is a sectional view taken on the line 10B 10B of Fig. 10A. In the drawings, the inner case RFSb is built up of a frame type of drawn section 30 providing a concave portion at its center, bent sections 31 made by bending a pair of opposite side edges to each other upwardly about 90 and cut away sections 32 made by cutting respective four corners in the slanting direction.This case RFSb is formed by press working of excellent conducting materials, for example, an oxygen free copper plate. In this case, the drawn section 30 and the bent sections 31 have a function of ameliorating mechanical strength of this inner case RFSb in the spiral direction and at once to suitably restrict outer length L in the vertical and transversial directions between each opposite bent sections 31 to each other. Further, the drawn section 30 can suitably arrange the distance between the magnet body BlMb disposed at the outer surface sides of this case RFSb and the chip CHI disposed at the inner surface side thereof. Besides, the cut away sections 32 provided at the four cor ners form the drawing section of respective sections 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d to be bent of the substrate FPC disposed in this caSe RFSb. According to the construction described above, it is possible to form the inner case RFSb by the press work. Thus, it can be manufactured in highly accurate dimensions and at low cost Further, for the inner case RFSb, oxygen free copper is employed but it is possible to employ copper, silver, or gold plate or the plate made by planting the alloy plate of these materials. Fig. 11 shows the outer case RFSa corre sponding with the above stated inner case RFSb. Fig. 11A is a plan view. Fig. 11B is a sectional view taken on the line 11 B 11 B. In the drawings, this outer case RFSa is produced by using the same materials and manufacturing method with the above stated inner case RFSb. It is comprised of a frame type of drawing section 33 providing a concave portion at its center, bent sections 34 made by bending two pairs of opposite side edges upwardly about 90c and cut away sections 35 made by cutting away respective four corners in the slanting direction, similarly with the above stated case.In this case, two pairs of bent sections 34 are formed to have the almost same inside length between the opposite bent sections with the outside length L between the corresponding opposite bent sections of said inner case RFSb and higher height H than those of said inner case RFSb.Moreover, these drawn section 33 and cut away sections 35 are formed to have the almost same dimensions with those of said inner case RFSb. The outer case RFSa and the inner case RSFb as constructed above are assembled to be an integrated case RFS by means of inserting the inner case RFSb into the outer case RFSa and connecting them with each other to make the inner case RFSb be in contact with the outer surfaces of the bent sections 31 of the outer case RFSa, as shown in Fig. 12A which is the plan view of the case RFS and in Fig. 12B which is the sectional view taken on the line 12B 12B of Fig. 12A. Case assembly Fig.13 Fig. 13 is a sectional view showing the abovestated case RFS and the substrate assembly BND accomodated and disposed in said case. In thisFigure, on the bottom of the outer case RFSa, for example, about 0.1 mm of thickness of polyimid film 36 is dispossed and attached as an electrically insulating sheet. The substrate assembly BND and the magnetic circuit PFC are respectively disposed on this film 36 and the peripheral portion thereof. Further, an epoxy system adhesive agent 37 is coated on the upper surface of the substrate assembly BND and then, in the upper part of them, the inner case RFSb is inserted, disposed and joined. In this instance, the inner surfaces of the bent sections 34 of this outer case RFSa are mechanically and electrically jointed with the outer surfaces of the bent sections 31 of the inner caseRFSb at the portions marked by X by means of metal flowing, soldering or the like. Silicon resinSIR fills in the gap between this outer case RFSa and this inner case RFSb so as to fixedly dispose the substrate assembly BND and the magnetic circuit PFC.Further, in this case, the sections 2 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d to be bent of the substrate FPC are drawn from respective cut away sections 32, 35 not shown provided at the four corners of these outer case RFSa and inner case RFSb to the outside. 38 denotes a lead wire for connecting coils COI with each other or connecting the coil COI with an external terminal 9c provided on the substrate FPC. Under the construction described above, in case of generating a leakage magnetic field by means of driving the magnetic circuit PFC, induced current is flown through the case RFS so as to form a closed loop. This induced current serves to confine a revolving magnetic field in the case RFS and thus the uniform revolving magnetic field is supplied to the chip CHI. According to this construction, the chip CHI loaded on the substrate FPC and the magnetic circuit PFC are respectively disposed so as to be caught in the central concave portion and in the peripheral covex portion between the outer case RFSa and the inner case RFSb. Thus, it is possible to ameliorate a packaging effect and assembling efficiency much. Moreover, since the volume covered by the outer case RFSa and the inner case RFSb is diminished, a Vl product a volume can be reduced and thus it is possible to miniaturize the magnetic circuit PFC for generating a revolving magnetic circuit.Further, by reducing a gap be tween the opposite concave portions by means of providing concave portions formed by the drawn sections 30, 33 on the outer case RFSa and the inner case RFSb, in the revolving magnetic field, only the vertical component to the level of the chip CHI Z component are made close to zero and thus only the horizontal componemt is left. Accord ingly, it is possible to ameliorate uniformity of the magnetic field. Then, since the magnetic circuit PFC and the case RFS have a symmetric structure in relation to a vertical axis to the element surface of the chip CHI, it is possible to ameliorate the uniformity thereof much more.

Fig. 15A is a perspective view thereof. Fig. 15B is a sectional view taken on the line 15B 15B of Fig. 15A. In the drawings, the bias coil BIC is formed to be a picture frame type having a predetermined value by means of providing windings in order 40 on which, for example, thermosetting resin is coated as an insulated member so as to be disposed as 5X 4 windings in section and to make the overall form picture frame like and then pressure melding the windings by thermal deposition and cooling it.In this case, the bias coil is formed by thermal depositing thermosetting resin coated on the outer surfaces of respective windings 40 and loading respective windings 40 and loading respective windings 40 by pressure welding. Then, by cooling it, respective windings 40 are hardened in the united state of wind ings and thus having a predetermined picture frame.

In this Figure, an upper magnet body BlMa and a lower magnet body BlNb are respectively disposed and jointed on the upper and the lower surfaces of the case RFS assembly accomodated in the substrate assembly BND and the magnetic circuit PFC. And, the bias coil BIC is accomodated and disposed in a picture frame groove section formed by being surrounded by the peripheral portion of this upper magnet body BlMa and the bent sections of the inner case RFSb. In this instance, the upper magnet body BlMa and the lower magnet body BlMb are formed by means of the same materials and in the same dimensions with each other.These magnet bodys BlMa and BlMb at their inclined plate INN sides are respectively disposed closely in a concave portion surrounded by the drawn section 30 of the inner case RFSb and a concave portion surrounded by the drawn section 33 of the outer case RFSa. According to the construction described above, it is possible to dispose a pair of magnet bodys BlMa and BlMb in the concave portions formed at both surfaces of the central part of the case RFS assembly and further provide the bias coil BIC in the picture frame groove formed in the peripheral section of those magnet bodys. Thus, the overall thickness of each component in the laminating di rection is made smaller and the miniaturizing and thinning of the construction can be realized. Further, since the picture frame space groove is formed by the outer case RFSa and the peripheral portion of the upper magnet body BlMb, it is possible to dispose the above stated bias coil BIC in this space groove, to newly provide a bias coil and further to form a bias coil by accomplishing windings as using the groove as a coil bobbin.

In Fig. 25, a signal to noise ratio S N ratio is ameliorated by means of forming the magnetic resistance elements MEM and MED by a multilayered magnetic layer.For example, in case of utilizing a three layered Permalloy layer laying a SiO2 film as a transfer pattern between respective layers, it is possible to ameliorate a S N ratio over doubly in comparison with the case of using a Permalloy single layer as shown in the following Table 2. EMI16.1 tb SEP Table SEP 2 tb SEP Single SEP Noise tb SEP S N SEP ratio tb SEP output SEP S SEP component tb single SEP layer SEP 8 SEP mV SEP 1.1 SEP mV SEP 7.3 tb three SEP layers SEP 12 SEP mV SEP SEP SEP 0.7 SEP mV SEP 17 tb Further, the efficiency of the guardrail GR can be improved because of heightening a discharging factor for unnecessary bubbles by means of reducing retentiveness Hc. Fig. 26 shows magnetic bubble generator GEN.The current generated in the magnetic bubbles can be made smaller by making the transfer pattern layer P multilayered and thus it is made possible to lengthen the life of the conducting layer CND of the magnetic bubble generator. Accordingly, the driving circuit for the conducting layer CND can employ a semiconductor element with a small current capacity value and thus its cost can be made lower. Fig. 27 shows a minor loop m composed of transfer patterns such as Pa Ph and the like, a write major line WML composed of the transfer patterns such as Pw, to Pws and the like and a swap gate section composed of a hairpin conducting layer CND. In this Figure, P7 is the same with the transfer pattern P7 in the bubble generatorGEN shown in Fig. 26. In other words, the bubbles generated in the bubble generator GEN are transferred to the write major line WML through the P1 to P7 transfer pathes.When the swap conducting layer CND is energized, the magnetic bubbles in the transfer pattern Pd of the minor loops ml are transferred through the transfer patterns P L andPm to the transfer pattern Pw3 of the major lineWML and the magnetic bubbles from the major linePW1 are transferred through the transfer patternsPk, Pj and Pi to the transfer pattern Pe of the minor loop in order to accomplish an exchange of bubbles, that is, informations with each other. Further, the swap gate is not provided in the minor loop md at the right end, because it is a dummy loop where magnetic bubbles are not injected for reducing a peripheral effect. As described above, it is possible to accomplish an exchange of magnetic bubbles with a small current value by means of making the transfer pattern layers Pi to Pm at the exchange location multilayered. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 28, similarly with the above, it is possible to accomplish the drive with a small current value by means of a replicator for magnetic bubbles, that is, a divider therefor. In this Figure, the magnetic bubbles are usually transferred on the route of Pn to Pg and Ps to Px. When the conducting layer CND is energized, the bubbles is divided at the location of the transfer patternPg and one divided magnetic bubble is transferred to a read major line RML by way of Py and P8 toP1O. Holding magnetic field and Revolving magneticfield, Fig. 29 The magnet body MAG is disposed as about 2 degrees tilted in relation to the chip CHI. This is designed to apply a bias magnetic field Hb to the chip CHI in the direction a little shifted from the vertical. Thus, it is possible to generate a holding magnetic field Hdc for ameliorating a atart and a stop margins of the bubble transfer to raise about 6 Oe Fig. 29A . As shown in Fig. 29A, on account of the slant at a 6 degres angle between the magnet body BIM and the chip CHI, the series magnetic field Hz is made to have a component Hdc on the xy plane.And magnitude of this in plane component Hdc is Kdcosine and usually, the slanting angle 6 is selected to be Kdcesine 5 0e 6 0e . Further, the direction of this in plane component Hdc is slanted to coincide with the start and stop St Sp direction in the revolving magnetic field Hr x axis direction . This component Hdc on this xy plane is a well known magnetic field effectively served as the start and stop St Sp operation of the revolving magnetic field Hr and called as a holding field. Further, magnitude of the bias magnetic field Hb vertically functioned on the chip CHI plane is made to be Hz coso. The above stated holding field Hdc always functions on the xy plane of the chip CHI and thus the revolving magnetic field Hr functioning to said chip CHI is made eccentric as illustrated in Fig.29B. In this drawing, Hr denotes a revolving magnetic field applied from the external. Hr denotes a revolving magnetic field functioning to the chipCHI. In this case, the revolving magnetic field Hr functioning to the chip CHI is made to be a synthesis of the revolving magnetic field Hr applied from the external and the in plane component Hdc and the center 0 of the revolving magnetic field Hr is shifted in parallel by the in plane component Hdc in the start and stop St Sp direction, that is, xaxis direction. Thus, as is obvious from the result of Fig. 29B, if the intensity of the revolving magnetic field Hr applied from the external is IHrl, the intensity IHr l of the revolving magnetic field effectively functioning to the chip CHI is variable in accordance with the phase of the revolving magnetic field Hr.Namely, IHr I in the St Sp direction is made to be IHrl IHdcl, which is more intensified by the intensity Hdc of the holding field Hdc in comparison with IHrl. Conversely, IHr I in the opposite direction to the St Sp direction is made to be IHrI IHdcl, which is made weaker by gHdcl in comparison with 1Hrl. Peripheral circuit Fig. 30 Lastly, a peripheral circuit of the chip CHI is described with reference to Fig. 30. RF denotes a circuit for generating a revolving magnetic field Hr by flowing the current whose phase difference is 90 degrees through the X and Y coils of the chipCHI. SA denotes a sense amplifier for sampling a minute bubble detecting signal from the magnetic resistance element of the chip CHI in accordance with a timing of the revolving magnetic field, sensing and amplifying it. DR denotes a driving circuit for generating the bubbles in relation to the write in the magnetic bubble memory device MBM, flowing current through respective replicate functioning conductors in relation to swapping and reading in accordance with a predstermined timing and driving a bias coil BIC.The above stated circuits are synchronized by means of a timing generator TG so as to be operated in synchronization with a cycle and a phase angle of the revolving magnetic field Hr. Revolving magnetic field distribution characteristic,Fig. 31 Fig. 31 shows a revolving magnetic field distribution characteristic of the above stated magnetic circuit PFC. It means that in this Figure, when the axis of abscissas shows the length in the x axis direction with 0 as the center of the magnetic circuit PFC shown in Fig. 8B and the axis of ordinates shows the revolving magnetic field intensity Hx in the x axis direction in case of establishing the revolving magnetic field intensity in the xaxis direction Hx 0, the revolving magnetic field distribution characteristic as shown in the curve I can be obtained.As is obvious from this Figure, it is possible to obtain almost uniform revolving magnetic field intensity Hx in the range of Xc Xc of the distance between the insides of the coreCOR sides facing to each other in the magnetic circuit PFC and 2 of uniformity of the magnetic field intensity in the range of Xe Xe of the effective area of the chip CHI the minimal area to which a revolving magnetic field is to be applied .Further, the curve II shown by a broken line denotes a revolving magnetic field distribution characteristic. The other embodiments or Flexible substrate Figs. 32, 33, 34 and 35 In the embodiment described above, there is described the example employing a flexible substrate FPC formed to be a windmill form. With regard to this substrate FPC, except this embodiment, various kinds of applications are brought about in accordance with the form of the outer connection terminal connecting section 3 and the way of taking out it from the corner sections of the case RFS for confining a revolving magnetic field. Fig. 32 shows the embodiment wherein two rectangular connecting sections 3a, 3b are extended from the upper side of a chip loading section 1 in the right and the left directions and bent by the sections 2a, 2b. Further, Fig. 33 shows the embodiment wherein two Y like connecting sections 3a, 3b are extended in the diagonal line direction and are bent by the sections 2a, 2b. Fig. 34 shows the embodiment wherein there is employed a wholly rectangular substrate FPC providing connecting sections 3a, 3b on the right side and the left side and these sections are bent by the sections 2a, 2b. Fig. 35 shows the embodiment wherein four chips are loaded on a wholly crossshaped substrate FPC and of four connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d provided at respective tips of the substrate, two pairs of opposits connecting sections are respectively bent on the upper surface and the lower surface of the module. In Fig. 35, the connecting sections 3a, 3b are bent to the upper surface of the module by the sections 2a, 2b and the connecting sections 3c, 3d are bent to the lower surface of the module by the sections 2c, 2d and thus the substrate FPC has a three layered structure as a whole.Further, in the embodiment shown in Figs. 34 and 35, there is shown in the drawings the construction wherein respective sections to be bent are wholly drawn out of respective side surfaces of the case RFS for confining a revolving magnetic field in order to prevent complication of the drawings, but for the purpose of keeping uniformity of a magnetic field and reducing loss thereof, it is preferable to draw respective sections to be bent at the corners of the case RFS for enclosing a revolving magnetic field. Accordingly, a square hole should be provided at the root sections of respective sections to be bent and the bent sections 34 shown in Fig. 11 ahould be passed through these holes. As described above, according to the present invention, it is designed to dispose the magnetic bubble memory chip loaded with the flexible substrate in the space section of the revolving magnetic circuit consisting of.a picture frame core and to lay the overall body for confining a revolving magnetic field within the case, the body being made of good conducting materials, and to electrically connect the peripheral portion of the overall body with the case.Thus, it is possible to obtain quite excellent effects that a highly uniform revolving magnetic field can be obtained by a small Vl product because of reducing the space for generating a leakage magnetic field and the magnetic bubble memory module which is designed to lower power consupmtion, miniaturize and thin the overall form and ameliorate assembling efficiency can be obtained because of miniaturizing the case for confining a revolving magnetic field. Modified embodiment 1 In the next place, a series of embodiments shown in Fig 1 thru Fig. 23 will be described in conjunction with Fig. 32 thru Fig. 45. Here, description about the configuration material, structure and method and the effect similar to those for Fig. 1 thru Fig. 23 are omitted. Modified embodiment 1 of the flexible substrate Fig. 32 Fig. 32 shows a modified embodiment of a flexible substrate. The flexible substrate FPC2 differs from that shown in Fig. 4 in such points as follows 1 Lead wires 100 are formed in four direc tions at 102a thru 102d where they were taken out of RFS, however, they are con centrated into two directions, left and right, at the connection parts openings 1041 and 104k of the film 101 with the ceramic sub strate Fig. 42 described later. 2 The flexible substrate FPC2 is electrically connected through the external terminal pin grid described with Fig. 42 without bending. 3 Characteristic inspection at halfway steps of assembly has been made possible by providing an extension part 100 d of the lead wire 100 on the flexible substrate FPC2. The terminal 109b can be checked with a probe. 4 In order to make automatic assemble, etc., easy or to use the film substrate and production facilities of standard specifica tions in the industry, the width longitudinal length in the drawing of the film substrate 101 FPC2 is limited to 35mm which is one of the reasons for concentrating lead wires in two directions as stated in the article 1 . Besides, feed holes 105a are provided on the film 101. This film 101 is cut along the singledot chain lines shown in the drawing, and unnecessary parts as the finished product are cut off. The substrateFPC2 has a copper foundation lead wire pattern which is formed by means of patterning with etching technique the copper film which is lined with epoxy system adhesive onto the base film composed of a polyimide resin film having the thickness of approsimately 50um. On the copper foundation lead wire layer, a Ni plating layer and an Auplating layer are formed successively by the electroplating method, etc. This Au plating layer is provided for the purpose of preventing from the elec tricel migration of the copper layer. or making the thermocompression bonding of the magnetic bubble memory chip CHI with the bonding pad easy. The Ni layer is used for the purpose of improving adherence between the copper layer and the Au layer. The lead wire pattern 100 of each frame is connected at this stage by the frame shaped pattern provided along the periphery shown in the drawing and the estended portion 100e, but it is for electroplating. On one frame of the film substrate FPC2, the external connection parts 100c of lead wire 100 are concentrated in two directions as previously described. One of the reasons for the concentration in the left and right directions instead of upward and downward directions is to obtain compatibility with the 35mm film described above. Another reason is as follows. The memory chip CHI is face up bonded underneath the film substrate FPC2, but the substrate FPC2 and the chip CHI are inclined in left and right directions in the drawing as described later. Under the same bias condition as Fig. 2B, inclination toward the right is arranged such that the left side is high and the right side is low with the magnet body as the reference. Thus, the substrate FPC2 is not inclined in upward and downward directions.Therefore, when the film substrate and the chip CHI is electrically connected after bonding the chip CHI to a conductor case described later, uniform force is applied to the whole connection parts on the lefthand side and uniform bonding can also be made in the similar manner on the righthand side in bonding the connection part 100c between the film substrate FPC2 and the chip with the pad of the chip CHI. The same applies to the connection between the film substrate FPC and the printed substrate described later. Modified embodiments 1 of the case for confining a revolving magnetic field Figs. 33, 34 and 35 Fig. 33 shows the inner case RFS2b. Fig. 33A is a plan view, and Fig. 33B is a sectional view taken on the line 33B 33B of Fig. 33A. This caseRFS2b is different from that shown in Fig. 10 in such points that the drawing section is omitted and the bottom plate thickness gets thicker as getting cioser to the righthand side. As shown in Fig. 33B, the lower surface of the bottom plate is tapered lowering toward the right at an angle of 1.7 degree against the upper surface. As seen from Fig. 38B, a plate HOM for homogenizing a magnetic field and the magnetic body of a permanent magnet are provided on the upper surface and the chip CHI is arranged on the lower surface.In other words, the inclination of thickness is provided for the purpose of giving to the chip CHI a holding magnetic fieldHdc due to the inclination between the magnetic body and the chip CHI. The inclined surface of the conductor case described above is formed by means of press work with about 300 tons inclined padding process . As other forming method, such inclined surface may be formed either by cutting or by tilting a roller during rolling process. Since the operation of bending the film substrate along the drawing section will no longer be performed due to omission of the drawing sections as shown in Fig. 10, the stress applied to the film substrate is lightened. Furthermore, since an inclined surface is provided on the conductor caseRFS2b itself, the inclined plates INM and INN shown in Fig. 14 4 plates in total are no longer required, thereby decreasing the number of components. The reduction in the number of components leads to reduction in material cost and assembly cost. Fig. 34 shows the outer case RFS2a. Fig. 34A is a plan view and Fig. 34B is a sectional view on the line 34B 34B. The difference of the outer caseRFS2a from the inner case RFS2b exists in that it has a drawing section 133 for containing or fitting the magnetic core PFC. On the upper surface of the bottom plate of the outer case RFS2a, a tapered surface lowering to the right which is similar to the lower surface of the bottom plate or the inner case RFS2b is provided. Fig. 35 shows the status of only the outer and inner cases RFS2a and RFS2b assembled together The chip CHI, the film substrate FPC2 and the magnetic core PFC are omitted in the drawing in the same way as Fig. 12 . Fig. 12A is a plan view and Fig. 12B is a sectional view taken on the line 35B 35B. Modified embodiment 1 of the case assembly Fig.36 Fig. 36 shows the status of the chip CHI, the flexible substrate FPC2, and the magnetic circuitPFC accommodated in the outer case RFS2a the status before covering up with the inner caseRFS2b . Fig. 36A is a plan view and Fig. 36B is a sectional view taken on the line 36B 36B. The chip CHI is mounted on the substrate before being accommodated in the case RFS2a.When the surface of the flexible substrate FPC2 on which the lead wire 100 is located is called the front surface, the chip CHI is mounted on the back of the flexible substrate FPC2 keeping the main surface up face up , on which bonding pads, lead wires and the transport path are located. It is needless to say that connection is made at the lead wire part 1 ova of the substrate FPC2 and the pad area of the chip CHI, but both are bonded by means of thermocompression of the lead wire part 100a on the pad with toolings such as a capillary. After bonding, the film substrate 101 consisting of plurality of substrates FPC2 is separated into individual substrate FPC2, and unnecessary lead wire parts and reinforced area which were used in plating the periphery are cut off as shown in Fig.36A. The conductor case RFS2a is applied with adhesives such as epoxy system resin by a stamping method, where the back of the chip CHI which was bonded on the film substrate FPC2 is adhered. The relation at this time between the locations of the chip CHI and the case RFS2a can be determined precisely by means of the cut away section 135 of the case RFS2a and external connecting sections 1 02a thru 1 02d. If necessary, more fine positioning adjustment is feasible by using jigs, etc. Then, the magnetic circuit PFC is housed in the groove formed by the drawing section 133 of the case RFS2a and the outside wall 134. Under such status, potting with silicone resin REG2 is performed around the chip CHI. The selicon resinREG2 increases its fluidity by heating treatment and gets into between the back of the flexible substrate FPC2 and the main surface of the chipCHI by means of the capillary action, thereby protecting the chip CHI against adhesion of dust and permeation of moisture. The height of the case RFS2a at the drawing section 133 is determined so that the flexible substrate FPC2 will be flat all over the inside of the case as shown in Fig. 36B taking the thickness of the magnetic circuit FPC and the thickness of the chip CHI into consideration. Thereafter, the caseRFS2b is welded by the ultrasonic welding method at its surface contact part with the case RFS2a. Modified embodiment 1 of the magnet body Fig.37 Fig. 37 shows the magnet body BIM2 Fig 37A is a plan vies, Fig. 37B is a side view and Fig. 37C is a sectional view taken on the line 37C 37C.The magnet body BIM 2 shown differs from that BIM shown in Fig. 14 in such a point that inclined plates INM and INN are omitted. Modified embodiment 1 of mounting of the magnet body and the bias coil to the case assembly Fig.38 Fig. 38 shows the status of the magnet bodyBIM2 shown in Fig. 37 and the bias coil BIC shown in Fig. 15 accommodated in the case assemblyRFS2 described with reference to Fig. 36. Fig. 38A is a plan view and Fig. 38B is a sectional view taken on the line 38B 38B. The upper magnet body BlM2a and the bias coil BIC are mounted on the plateshape inner caseRFS2b, and the lower magnet body BlM2b is mounted on a flat part surrounded by the drawing section 38 of the outer case RFS2a. Modified embodiment 1 of mounting of the magnet body and the bias coil to the case assembly Fig.38 Fig. 38 shows the status of the magnet bodyBIM2 shown in Fig. 37 and the bias coil BIC shown in fig. 15 accommodated in the case assemblyRFS2 described with reference to Fig. 36. Fig. 38A is a plan view and Fig. 38B is a sectional view taken on the line 38B 38B. The upper magnet body 81M2a and the bias coil BIG are mounted on the plate shape inner case RFS2b, and the lower magnet body BlM2b is mounted on a flat part surrounded by the drawing section 38 of the outer case RFS2a. As seen from Fig. 38B, the chip CHI and the magnetic circuit PFC are inclined in left and right directions with reference to a parallel surface formed by upper and lower magnet bodies BlM2a and BIM2b. Besides, the condition for arranging the magnetic circuit PFC and the chip CHI in parallel remains unchanged from those embodiments shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 16, but the thickness of the chip CHI, the thickness of the magnetic circuitPFC and the height of the drawing section 38 of the outer case RFS2a are designed so that the uppermost end surface of the magnetic circuit PFC and the upper surface of the chip CHI are almost even with each other, thereby preventing from application of the stress to the flexible substrateFPC2. Modified embodiment 1 of the magnetic shield case Fig. 39, Fig. 40 Fig. 39 shows the upper shield case SHI2a. Fig. 39A is a plan view, Fig. 39B is the right side view and Fig. 39C is the bottom side view. As seen from Fig. 39A, the plane figure of the upper shield case SHI2a is square in shape and is symmetrical for any axis of four center lines passing the same point not shown , horizontal, vertical, and going up and down at 450 toward the right The cut away sections 154 at four cormers making a right angle with the 450 center lines are provided for the purpose of having lead wire portions 1 02a thru 102d pass through at the four corners of the film substrate FPC shown in Fig. 32. 151 denotes the plane section of the case, and 152 denotes the upright wall section.Protruded sections 152a thru 152d are provided at the center part of each side of the walls 152. The height of protruded sections 152a and 1 52c on left and right sides is to be h2, and the height of protrusion itself h2 h, is to be the same as the thickness to of the lower shield case SHI2b shown in Fig. 40 Furthermore, the height of the protruded sections 152b and 152d on upper and lower sides is to be h3, and the height of protrusion itself h2 h is to be slightly bigger than the thickness to of the lower shield case SHl2b. For example, it is determined that h, 4.5, h2 5.0, h3 5.3, and to 0.5 and arrangement is made so that the protruded sections 152b and 1 52d of upper and lower sides of the upper shield case SHI2a slightly h3 h. to 0.3 protrude over the lower plane part of the lower shield case SHI2b when the upper and lower shield cases SHI2a and SHI2b are assembled, thereby making the positioning easy with the ceramic printed substrate shown in Fig.42. The unit for each value is mm. Fig. 40 shows the lower shield case SHl2b. Fig.40A is a plan view, and Fig. 40B is a lower side view. The plate shaped lower shield case SHI2b has concave portions corresponding to the thickness to of the wall 152 of the upper shield case SHI2a on four sides, left and right, and upper and lower, where protruded sections 152a thru 152d of the upper case are fitted. The. length in longitudinal and horizontal directions L103 and L104 of each case shown in Fig. 39 and Fig. 40, respectively, are designed same, for example, at 22.4mm. The lower shield case SHI2b does not require bending process comparing with that SHlb shown in Fig. 18. This results in not only cost reduction but also small thickness of the finished device. Modified embodiment 1 of the magnetic shield case assembly Fig. 41 Fig. 41 shows the magnetic shield cases SHI2a and SHIPS shown in Fig. 39 and Fig. 40 packaged therein with the intermediate assembly shown inFig. 38. Fig. 41A is a plan view and Fig. 41B is a sectional view taken on the line 41 B 41 B. The assembly shown in Fig. 41 still includes terminals 109a, 109b, and extended portion of lead wires for plating that are not required for the final assembly, however, it is possible to perform the operation test and selection of acceptable products for the intermediate assembly at this stage, thereby reducing the average assembly cost per device. Besides, the continuity test and the short circuit test between the film substrate FPC2 and the chip CHI are performed after face up bonding previously described and at the stage when the conductor case RFS2, etc. has been assembled, respectively. The upper and lower shield cases RFS2a andRFS2b are welded together by the spot welding method or the laser welding method. Pin grid terminal substrate Fig. 42 Fig. 42 shows a substrate for electrically connecting the shield case assembly shown in Fig. 41 to the pin grid external connection terminal. Fig.42A is a plan view, Fig. 42B is a sectional view taken on the line 42B 42B, and Fi.g 42C is a bottom view. The ceramic substrate 201 provided with lead wires 205 thereon includes the upper thruhole connection terminals 206, the thruholes 207 and the lower thruhole connection terminals 208. The other end 205a of the lead wires 205 shows the portion where the outer lead portion 100c of the flexible substrate FPC2 is connected. The external connection pins 204 arranged in grid shape are connected electrically with the upper terminals 206 through conductive layers formed in the thruholes 207.Among the lead wires 205, those that are a little thicker than others are for connecting X coil, Y coil and bias coil 2 terminals each of Ix, ly and Ib . 202 denotes a ceramic plate, on which the lower shield case SHI2b is adhered with epoxy resin, etc. That is, this ceramic plate 202 fulfils the duties of an insulation plate which prevents from short circuit of the lead wire portion 205b by the lower shield case SHI2b which is to be positioned thereon. Furthermore, the ceramic plate 202 includes the concave portions 202b, 202d, where abovesaid protruded sections 152b, 152d of the upper shield case SHI2a are fitted in, thus also serving to the positioning in case of adherence of the shield case assembly. The ceramic substrate 201 and the ceramic plate 202 are put in layers under the condition of green ceramics and are sintered thereafter. 203 denotes a frame shaped sealing ring, which is adhered to the edge of the ceramic substrate 201 by silver brazing alloy material, etc., and it is arranged such that the packaging cap PKG2 described later is welded to the portion protruding outside from the substrate 201. For the material of the frame 203 and the grid pin 204, Fe Ni Co alloy popular name KOVAR which has the coefficient of thermal expansion close to ceramics is selected. On the portion of the ceramic substrate 201 where lead wires 205, terminals 206, 208, thruholes 207 and frames 203 are brazed, double metalized layers are formed. After two ceramic members 201, 202 are sintered, the grid pins 204 and the frame 203 are brazed to the ceramic substrate 201 with silver brazing alloy material. The double metalized layers have such function as to increase the adhesive strength. Under such status, Ni and Au layers are electroplated successively on the pin grid substrate TEF2, i.e., on the exposed double metalized layers and KOVAR material. The Ni layer is provided for the purpose of increasing the adhesive strength between the doubled layer and the Au layer. The pins 204 are composed of KOVAR material, but since they are Au plated, the solderability related to packaging on the printed substrate, etc.by users is improved. The Au plated layer at the end portion 205a of the lead wire 205 makes the thermocompression bonding with Au plated outer lead 100c of the film substrate FPC2 possible. TheAu plated layer of the frame 203 is useful for hermetic encapsulation of the packaging cap PKG2 described later. On the back of the ceramic substrate 201, a double metalized layer, i.e. an Au plated layer is formed a little wider than the adhered surface between the frame 203 and the pin 203 as shown with contour lines 209, 208 and no gap is arranged to exist on the adhered boundary surface by silver brazing alloy, etc., which achieves hermetic encapsulation along with the use of ceramics material and the packaging cap PKG2 described later. Besides, Au plating layer is not formed at the area 205b of the lead wire 205 located underneath the ceramic plate 202. However, since the pitch between the lead wires is wider than the film substrate FPC2 described previously, there is no problem of electric migration. Pin grid substrate assembly Fig. 43 Fig. 43 shows the status when the shield case assembly shown in Fig. 41 is packaged on the pin grid substrate TEF2 shown in Fig. 42. Fig. 43A is a plan view and Fig. 43B is a sectional view taken on the line 43B 43B. It has been described with reference to Fjg. 42 how to form the assembly, so such description is omitted here. Modified embodiment 2 of the packaging cap Fig.44 Fig. 44 shows an encapsulation cap. Fig. 44A is a plan view, and Fig. 44B is a sectional view taken on the line 44B 44B. The cap PKG2 made of KOVAR has two wall sections 221, 222, and the bending between two wall portions 221 and 222 is made so that the wall 222 almost contacts the upper shield case SHI2a as shown in Fig. 45 for the purpose of improving heat radiation capacity. The bottom part 223 is welded to a portion exposed from the ceramic substrate 201 of the frame 223 made of KOVAR by the resistance welding method, etc. Accordingly, the step difference between the exposed portion of the frame 223 and the side of the ceramic substrate 201 is useful for positioning in fitting the cap PKG2. how to form the assembly, so such description is omitted here. Modified embodiment 2 of the packaging cap Fig.44 Fig. 44 shows an encapsulation cap. Fig. 44A is a plan view, and Fig. 44B is a sectional view taken on the line 44B 44B. The cap PKG2 made of KOVAR has two wall sections 221, 222, and the bending between two wa ll portions 221 and 222 is made so that the wall 222 almost contacts the upper shield case SHI2a as shown in Fig. 45 for the purpose of improving heat radiation capacity. The bottom part 223 is welded to a portion exposed from the ceramic substrate 201 of the frame 223 made of KOVAR by the resistance welding method, etc. Accordingly, the step difference between the exposed portion of the frame 223 and the side of the ceramic substrate 201 is useful for positioning in fitting the cap PKG2. Modified embodiment 1 of the finished device structure Fig. 45 Fig. 45 shows the finished structure of a series of modified embodiments described with reference to Fig. 32 thru Fig. 44, that is, the structure of the intermediate assembly shown in Fig. 43 encapsulated with the cap PKG2 shown in Fig. 44.

Modified Embodiment 2, Figs. 46 and 47 The modified embodiment 2 is an improvement over the flexible substrate FPC of the first embodiment described in connection with Figs. 1 through 31. In the modified embodiment 2, a plurality of pins PIN, which are prospective connection terminals upon loading the substrate FPC on a board, are mounted on the substrate FPC. The substrate FPC to be used in the modified embodiment 2 of Fig. 46 has the same construction as the substrate FPC of Figs. 3 and 4, except that the pins PIN for connecting the substrate to the board are mounted on the outer connection terminal connecting section beforehand. As shown in Fig. 46, the substrate FPC is in the form of a windmill having four connecting sections 3 on each of which a plurality of pins PIN is mounted. With the substrate FPC of Fig. 46, the contact pad CNP of Fig. 23 is not required, because the pins PIN mounted on the substrate FPC serve to perform the electrical function of the contact padCNP. The assembling method of the module using the substrate FPC of Fig. 46 is virtually the same as the method described in connection with Figs. 1 through 22, except the following. At the connecting section 3 of Fig. 4B, the pins PIN are mounted on a circular outer terminal 9b via a solder plating layer 13. In the case assembly of Figs. 13, 16 and 20, the pins PIN project upwardly from the connecting section 3 of the substrate FPC extending from the case RFS. After the assembly of Fig. 20 is inserted into the packaging case PKG in the same method as the first embodiment, the connecting section 3 is bonded to and along the lower surface of the inner shield case SHlb. Subsequently, the pins PIN are inserted in an opening of a terminalfixing plate TEF, and then the terminal fixing plateTEF is secured to the shield case SHI and the packaging case PKG.AS a result, the module ofFig. 47 has been obtaine d. According to this module, it is possible to mount the module directly on the board loading the outer drive circuit. Modified Embodiment 3, Fig. 48 through 52 In this modified embodiment 3, the connection terminals are mounted on the terminal panel beforehand, and the outer connection terminals of the substrate FPC is connected to the connection terminals. With this arrangement, the substrate can be mounted directly on a board by the connection teminals of the terminal panel. The details of the entire structure of the magnetic bubble memory shown in Fig. 1 and 2 have been described hereinabove. Alternatively, the present invention may be carried out in the following modification. Fig. 48 is a plan view of the substrate FPC, illustrating the modified embodiment 3 of the present invention. In Figs. 48, 1 and 2, like reference numerals designate similar parts. As shown inFig. 48, the substrate FPC has at its center a squared chip loading section 1 and along its peripheral edge a frame like outer connection terminal connecting section hereinafter referred to as connecting section 3 3a , 3b , 3c , 3d . The substrate FPC is in the form of a unitary body and its entire shape is substantially rectangular. At the opposite sides of the chip loading section 1, there are formed a pair of rectangular openings 4 4a, 4b of a double frame structure loading two shipsCHI and connecting their terminals, and three holes 5 5a, 5b, 5c for positioning the chips CHI.Further, at the peripheral edge of the chip loading section 1, there are formed two pairs of trapezoidal openings 4 4a , 4b , 4c , 4d through which bent sections 34 of the outer case RFSa and bent sections 52 of the outer shield case SHla extend. On the other hand, along the peripheral edge of the connecting section 3 , there are arranged in row at a predetermined pitch a plurality of outer connection terminals hereinafter referred to as connection terminals 9 each composed of an annular conductive pattern 9f at its periphery and a circular opening 4 at its center. Lead wires 9a are connected to the respective connection terminals 9 connected to the chips CHI. Thus a substrate assembly BND has been provided. Fig. 49A is a plan view of a terminal panelPGA Fig. 49B is a cross sectional view taken along line 49B 49B of Fig. 49A Fig. 49C is a crosssectional view taken along line 49C 49C of Fig.49A. In Figs. 49A, 49B and 49C, the terminal platePGA comprises a resin plate 200 of electrically insulating material such as glass epoxy resin. The terminal panel PGA has at its center a square opening 201 in which the assembled case SHI described above is to be inserted, and its contour having such a width and a length that an opening of a packaging case PKG described below can be inserted. Along the periphery of the resin plate 200, a plurality of metal pins 202 is mounted at a pitch equal to the pitch of the outer connection terminals 9 mounted on the substrate FPC. Fig. 50A is a plan view of the packaging casePKG Fig. SOB is a cross sectional view taken along line 50B 50B of Fig. 50A. The packaging case PKG is provided by squeezing a 0.5 mm thickness plate of a good heat conductive material, such as aluminum, and has a main body 210, a jaw 211 defining a gap in the inner periphery, and an engaging portion 212 for fixing the opening end periphery, these portions are integrally formed with one another. Although not illustrated in the drawings, the packaging casePKG is covered over its outer surface with a black coating and has the function of the outer case and a radiator after completion of assembling of the magnetic bubble memory device. For assembling these constituent parts thus constructed, firstly, the substrate assembly BND described in connection with FIG. 48, together with the magnetic circuit PFC such as shown in Fig. 13, is sandwiched between the outer case RFSa and the lower case RFSb and is joined therewith. At that time, the respective bent sections 34 of the outer case RFSa are inserted through the four trapezoidal openings 4a , 4b , 4c , 4d , formed in the substrate FPC, and each connecting section 3 of the substrate FPC projects, in the shape of a frame, from the periphery of the case assemblyRFS. Then, the case asembly RFS, together with the pair of magnetic bodies BIM and the bias coil BIC, is superimposed and sandwiched between the outer shield case SHia and the inner shield case SHib to establish electrical and mechanical connection.At that time, the respective bent sections 52 of the outer shield case SHla are inserted through the four trapezoidal openings 4a , 4b , 4c , 4d formed in the substrate FPC, and each connecting section 3 of the substrate FPC projects, in the shape of a frame, from the periphery of the shield case assembly SHI. Subsequently, the shield case assembly SHI is loaded on the terminal panel PGA described in connection with Fig. 49, and then the distal end of each pin 202 projecting from the terminal panelPGA is inserted in the opening 4 of each connection terminal 9 formed on the connecting section 3 of the substrate FPC, whereupon electrical and mechanical connection is established by soldering at 203 as shown in Fig. 51. At that time, the shield case assembly SHI is inserted in the opening 201 formed in the terminal panel PGA with spaces. The shield case assembly SHI is then inserted in the packaging case PKG Fig. 52 .In this state, the respective connecting sections 3a , 3b , 3c , 3d of the substrate assembly BND are bent from the four corners of the packaging case PKG firstly ar an angle of about 900 in one direction, then at an angle of 90 in the reverse direction, and extend into the jaw 211 of the packaging nase PKG. Then, resin molding by potting method takes place in the packaging case PKG, and the engaging section 212 of the packaging case PKG is brought into engagement with the peripheral bottom surfaces of the terminal panel PGA. As a result, the magnetic bubble memory device has been produced. with this arrangement, because the connecting section 3 collecting and properly arranging the connection terminals 9 connected to the respective lead wire 9a of the chip CHI, it is possible to minimize the width and length of the substrate FPC so that standard 35 mm film can be used, thus reducing the cost of material and of production.Further, since the connection section 3 provided at the periphery of the substrate FPC can be electrically and mechanically connected to the terminal panel PGA having a plurality of pins 202 mounted at its periphery corresponding to the peripheral of the substrate FPC, it is possible not only to easily mount the substrate FPC to the board BOD loading the outer drive circuit as shown in FIG.51, but also to lead out the lead wires in for directions to the outer drive circuit. Particularly in the case where the number of chips CHI is increased, better results can be achieved, that is, the chips CHI can be easily mounted with high density.Moreover, since the pins 202 of the terminal plate PGA arranged in a single row along the periphery corresponding to the connecting section 3 at the periphery of the substrate FPC, high density arrangement of the connection terminals can be achieved, thus enabling much higher density mounting of the chipsCHI. As described above, according to the modified embodiment 3, because the outer connection terminals of the flexible substrate and the connection terminals of the terminal panel are joined together, it is possible to minimize the size of the flexible substrate and hence the size and thickness of the entire assembly so that the latter can be easily mounted on the board loading the outer drive circuit, facilitating high density mounting of the magnetic bubble memory element. Modified Embodiment 4, Figs. 53 through 57 In the modified embodiment 4, a terminal panel is provided on which connection pins are mounted at the side surface of its module, and the module is superimposed over the board. The substrate FPC of Fig. 48 described above in the modified embodiment 3 is used in the modified embodiment 4. Fig. 53A is a plan view of a terminal panelPGA, and Fig. 53B is a cross sectional view taken along line 53B 53B of Fig. 53A. In Figs. 53A and 53B, the terminal panel PGA comprises a plate 300 of an electrically insulating material, such as glass epoxy resin, and has a rectangular contour substantially equal in height, width and lenght to the shied case assembly SHI. At the center of the resin plate 300, a plurality of conductive pins 310 are fixedly mounted at a pitch equal to the pitch of the connection terminals 9 mounted on the substrate FPC of Fig. 48. The conductive pins 310 have the function of the outer connection terminals to establish electrical connection to the outer drive circuit. Fig. 54A is a plan view of a packaging casePKG, and Fig. 54B is a cross sectional view taken along line 54B 54B of Fig. 54A. In Figs. 54A and 54B, the packaging case PKG comprises a plate of about 0.5 mm thickness and of a good heat conductive material such as aluminum, the aluminum plate being pressed. Although not illustrated in the drawings, the aluminum plate is covered over its outer surface with a black coating, and hence has the function of the outer case and a radiator after the magnetic bubble memory device has been completed. For assembling these constituent parts thus constructed, firstly, the substrate assembly BND of the modififed embodiment 3 described in connection with Fig. 48, together with the magnetic circuitFPC such as shown in Fig. 13, is sandwiched between the outer case RFSa and the lower caseRFSb and is joined therewith. At that time, the respective bent sections 34 of the outer case RFSa are inserted through the four trapezoidal openings 4a , 4b , 4c , 4d formed in the substrate FPC, and each connecting section 3 of the substrate FPC projects, in the shape of a frame, from the periphery of the case assembly RFS. Then, the case assembly RFS, together with the pair of magnetic bodies BIM and the bias coilBIC, is superimposed and sandwiched between the outer shield case SHla and the inner shield caseSHlb to establish electrical and mechanical connection. At that time, the respective bent sections 52 of the outer shield case SHla are inserted through the four trapezoidal openings 4a , 4b , 4c , 4d formed in the substrate FPC, and each connection section 3 of the substrate FPC projects, in the shape of a frame, from the periphery of the shield case assembly SHI. Subsequently, as shown in Fig. 56, each connecting section 3 of the substrate FPC is arranged at the diatal end portion of the pin 310 of the terminal panel PGA, and then the distal end 310a of each pin 310 is inserted in the opening 4 of each connection terminal 9 formed on each connecting section 3 of the substrate FPC, whereupon electrical and mechanical connection is established by soldering at 320. Then, as shown in Fig. 55, the four terminal panels PGA fixedly connected to each connecting section 3 of the substrate FPC are bent at an angle of about 180 with respect to the substrate assembly BND so as to be arranged at the four peripheral portions of the shield case assemblySHI, and are bonded with a non illustrated adhesive agent to the plate shaped packaging case PKG from its upper and lower sides. Finally, resin molding by potting method takes place in the packaging case PKG to fixedly place each constituent part between the packaging case PKG. As a result, as shown in Fig 57, the magnetic bubble memory device has be produced which has the outer connection terminal on which a plurality of connecting pins 310 are arranged in row along the four peripheral sides. As shown in Fig. 58, for example, three magnetic bubble memory devices DEV are superimposed one over another in a predetermined order, and circuit substrates PCB, on which Wiring patterns 320 are formed, are integrally connected by soldering to the outer connecting pins 310 of the terminal panels PGA of these devices DEV and are inserted through the openings 330 in the boardBOD loading the drive circuit. Then non illustrated conductive patterns for circuit, which patterns are formed on the rear surface of the board BOD, are connected by soldering with the wiring patterns formed on the circuit substrate PCB.Although inFig. 58 two circuit substrates PCB are connected to two opposite sides of three magnetic bubble memory devices DEV, it is practical that two additional circuit substrates PCB are likewise connected to the other two opposite sides of the three magnetic bubble memory devices DEV. With this arrangement, since three magnetic bubble memory devices DEV are superimposed one over another on the board BOD, parallel driving and hence high speed writing in and readingout can be achieved. Further, because the outer connecting pins 310 of the three magnetic bubble memory devices DEV, which pins have the same function, are disposed at the same side in alignment with those of each other s memory deviceDEV, wiring for outer connection can take place with maximum ease. Although in the modified embodiment 4 the four terminal panels PGA with the outer connecting pins 310 are mounted on the four sides of the module, it shoudl be noted that the present inven tion is not limited to this illustrated example. For example, two terminal panels PGA may be mounted on two opposite sides of the module, with the similar results. As described above, according to the modified embodiment 4, the outer connection terminals formed on the periphery of the flexible substrate are joined with the outer connecting pins of the terminal panel, and the terminal panel is disposed on the side surface of the case of good conductive material, thereby providing a magnetic bubble memory device. Then, a plurality of such magnetic bubble memory devices are superimposed one over another on the drive circuit substrate to thereby extablish electrical connection. With this construction, it is possible to mount a plurality of magnetic bubble memory devices within a small area corresponding to the area of only a single device, thus enabling not only high density mounting of the magnetic bubble memory elements and devices, but also series and parallel driving.
