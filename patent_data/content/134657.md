# SKID STEER VEHICLE

## Abstract
In a skid steer vehicle having its wheels 11 on one side driven and controlled independently of those on the other side, two main hand levers 21 and 121 control the wheels and two subsidiary hand levers 22 and 122 mounted on the main levers control a bucket loader fitted on the vehicle. Power operated loader booms 12 on either side of the operator constitute a safety hazard when he enters or leaves the vehicle. Restraint bars 27 and 127 which oblige the operator to immobilise both the wheels and the loader before he can leave the vehicle are pivotable on opposite sides of the vehicle between upwardly extending positions permitting egress and entry, in which positions respective locking members 40 and 140 linked to the bars engage the subsidiary levers to hold both the subsidiary and main levers in their neutral positions, and laterally inwardly extending positions blocking egress, in which positions the locking members do not engage the subsidiary levers whereby the subsidiary and main levers are freely moveable.
