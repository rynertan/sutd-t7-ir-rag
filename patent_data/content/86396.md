# Postage meter system.

## Abstract
A postage meter system includes a printer 32 adapted to print postage and a computer 44 coupled to the printer 32 to account for postage printed by the printer 32 . A power supply 72 is coupled to the computer 44 for ener gizing the computer to operate. The power supply includes a winding 66 adapted to energize the power supply when magnetic flux is caused to pass through the winding. The power supply further includes a magnetic flux path 68 for coupling magnetic flux to the winding 66 . A housing 16 encloses the power supply 72 , computer 44 and printer 32 . The housing 16 includes a portion 70 adapted to allow the passage of magnetic energy into the interior there of to energize the magnetic circuit. The system also includes a mailing machine base 12 adapted to engage the postage meter 10 and includes a power supply system 40 which energizes the mailing machine 12 and generates magnetic energy such that when the postage meter 10 is mounted on the mailing machine base 12 the magnetic energy will enter the postage meter 10 to energize winding 66 .
