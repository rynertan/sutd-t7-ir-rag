# Improvements relating to fillers for dough moulding compounds.

## Abstract
A filler for a dough moulding compound e.g. of unsaturated polyester resin containing glass fibre is prepd. by mixing a finely divided non absorbent filler with water to make a paste. An aqs. emulsion or dispersion of a thermoplastic polymer is mixed with, the paste and dried hot. The filler is CaCO3. The min. water is used to achieve good mixing of the polymer and filler. The polymer is polyvinyl acetate. The thermoplastic polymer which improves the crack resistance and flow properties of the moulding compound, is uniformly dispersed in the filler and subsequently in the moulding compound. The filler is mixed with a soln. of unsaturated polyester resin in a reactive monomer and glass fibres are then mixed in.

## Description
Improvements relatinq to fillers for dough moulding compoundsThis invention relates to an improved method of preparing the filler for use in a dough moulding compound.Dough mouldinq compounds based on, for example, unsaturated polyester resins are well known and in common use for moulding of components such as insulation for electrical distribution equipment. Their principal ingredients are a solution of an unsaturated polyester resin in a monomer such as styrene, chopped glass fibres and mineral filler such as calcium carbonate.UK Patent Specification No.936,351 describes moulding compounds of this type which contain a solution of an unsaturated polyester resin in a copolymerizable monomer, a peroxide catalyst, an inhibitor, a substantially non absorbent powdered mineral filler and a finely divided thermoplastic polymeric material in an amount between 2 and 24 per cent by weight of the total composition.The function of the thermoplastic polymeric material is to replace some of the powdered mineral filler and improve the crack resistance of thick mouldings moulded from the compound and the flow characteristics of the compound. UK Patent Specification tWo.936,351 describes essentially three methods of incorporating the thermoplastic polymeric material into the compound to achieve homogeneous dispersion. One such method when mixing the compound is to mix dry the thermoplastic polymeric material and the dry powdered mineral fillers of the formulation. In this method the polymeric additive has to be finely ground. This is difficult and costly and does not achieve very intimate dispersion.Another method is to add the thermoplastic polymeric naterial to the filler as a solution in an inorganic solvent, conveniently the same reactive monomer as that in which the unsaturated polyester is dissolved. This method achieves good dispersion but the undesired further addition of the reactive monomer adversely affects the flow of the compound and diminishes the quality of the final composition.Yet another method is to mix an aqueous emulsion of the thermoplastic polymeric material with the dry powdered mineral filler in a heated mixer until the water has evaporated. By this method it is difficult to obtain uniform distribution of the thermoplastic polymeric material in the filler, particularly when the amount of the former is low, as is usual in practice. It appears that the mixing of the emulsion with the dry filler leads to coagulation of the emulsion, resulting in a lack of uniformity of distribution of the thermoplastic polymer.The first two methods are the ones commonly used commercially, particularly the embodiment where the thermoplastic polymeric material is dissolved in a reactive monomer. Our invention is concerned with obtaining a homogeneous dispersion of the thermoplastic polymeric material in the moulding compound by an improvement of the previously unused third method.Thus, according to the present invention a method for the preparation of a filler for the manufacture of a dough moulding compound comprises mixing a finely divided mineral filler with an aqueous emulsion or dispersion of thermoplastic polymeric material wherein said mineral filler has intimately mixed therein, prior to its contact with said emulsion or dispersion, at least sufficient water to Prevent coaqulation of the aqueous emulsion or dispersion when the latter is mixed with said mineral filler and drvinq said mixture at an elevated temperature and forming a dry filler powder having said thermoplastic polymeric material uniformlv dispersed therein.We have found that if the emulsion or dispersion is mixed with wet filler, the hitherto unsatisfactory method of preparing the filler is improved to be superior to the others. Preferably the drying is carried out at a temperature low enough to ensure that said thermoplastic polymeric material does not become tacky.The finely divided mineral filler may be mixed with sufficient water to make a paste or thick slurry with the filler, but not so much water that when the emulsion is added the mixture becomes too runny. In some cases, however, it may be sufficient to ensure that all the particles of filler are damp, and the filler may remain a flowable powder. Water has to be dried off and is therefore to be kept to the minimum necessary to obtain the homogenous dispersion by simple mixing. Also a need for filtration is undesirable because of the potential waste of emulsified thermoplastics polymer in such a step. The preferred mineral filler is calcium carbonate either in its natural or synthetic form since it is both suitable and cheap, but other fillers such as clay, silicates, alumina, talc and asbestos may also be used instead.The thermoplastic polymeric material is to be one which is of a class of suitable polymers well known in the art.Clearly which monomer is to be used in the dough moulding compound will determine the suitability of thermoplastic polymeric materials. In practice, however, styrene is commonly used and polyvinyl acetate is a particularlv suitable polymer. In the present invention the thermoplastic polymeric material is used in aqueous dispersion or emulsion and any polymer can be used which is compatible with the monomer to be present in the dough moulding compound and is also available as the necessary aqueous emulsion or dispersion.The solids content of the aqueous emulsion or dispersion used is preferably as high as possible, to reduce the amount of water to be evaporated, while retaining the facility of mixing to a homogeneous mass with the filler. The usual range will be 30 to 75 solids but this is not essential.The minimum amount of water required in the mineral filler to make a paste will depend on the absorption characteristics of the filler chosen and these vary very considerably. Generally a range from 10 by weight up to about 40 by weight will embrace most examples.Clearly the amount of water in the filler is preferably to be kept to a minimum to avoid unnecessary drying costs.In the preparation of finely divided mineral fillers such as powdered calcium carbonate the grinding of the filler to size may be carried out in aqueous slurry, the wet filler then being filtered off. The wet filler cake is a thick pasty mass which may if desired, be used as the wet filler in the present invention.The drying of the mixed thermoplastic polymeric material and filler can be accomplished by conventional means such as agitation in a heated mixer, or in an oven, and the dried material may be resound. In the dried filler the proportion of the thermoplastic as polymeric material to filler will be made to suit the final formulation of the dough moulding compound. Thus in Example 1 below, a required 59.5 p.b.w. of calcium carbonate with 3 p.b.w. of the thermoplastic polymeric material in the dough moulding compound will make it desirable, for example, to prepare the treated filler with the same proportion of thermoplastic polymeric material filler in order that the treated filler can be used directly in the preparation of the douqh moulding compound. Alternatively the treated filler may be made with a higher proportion of thermoplastic polymeric additive, and used as a masterbatch, additional untreated filler being added to it during preparation of the dough moulding compound.Other ingredients of a douqh moulding compound may be added to the filler with the thermoplastic polymeric material if desired. Preferred examples of such ingredients are surfactants and flame retardants e.q.alumina trihydrate which could with advantage be homogeneously dispersed in the filler. The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of Example only.Example IDough moulding compounds of comparable composition were prepared by three different routes. In the first route a polyvinyl acetate powder was mixed dry with the filler, calcium carbonate, and in the second route polyvinyl acetate as a 50 solution in styrene was added to the other ingredients of the composition. These two routes are the ones in commercial use.In the third route 2975g of calcium carbonate filler Millicarb commercially available from PlastichemLimited was made into a thick slurry or paste by mixing with 1275g of water and 9g of dispersing agent, and 300g of a 50 solids aqueous emulsion of polyvinyl acetate 9300 grade commercially available from Vinyl ProductsLtd. were added and stirred until evenly dispersed. The slurry was then dried in an oven and reground using a hammer mill and then a ball mill.This product the treated filler was then mixed with 100q of calcium stearate in a sigma bladed mixer. 1075g of a 66 solids solution of an unsaturated polyester resin in styrene, catalysed with 1.5 of t butyl perbenzoate and inhibited with 0.2 of hydroquinone, were added to the treated filler and mixed until the filler was homogeneously dispersed, and finally 700g of 6mm glass fibre was added and mixed in for a further 2.5 minutes.The compositions of the three dough moulding compounds are given below in Table I.

Mouldinqs were made from all three comPounds, examined and tested. In the mouldings from the compounds made by using solid polyvinyl acetate there is a lack of homogeneity as evidenced by uneven gloss and colour on the surface. Moulding made from the compound using polyvinyl acetate in styrene solution were more homogeneous, but the extra styrene monomer thus provided made the flow inferior lower viscosity and this also adversely affected the surface finish.Conversely, the compound made using the treated filler gave mouldings having a superior finish with respect to the evenness, gloss and colour.The dry mixing of the thermoplastic polymeric material with the filler has the disadvantage that it is very difficult to obtain homogeneous dispersion. If a solution of the thermoplastic polymeric material in monomer is used there is improvement in homogeneity but there is extra monomer in the composition which cannot fully be compensated by increasing the solids content of the polyester resin solution. This extra monomer results in the dough moulding compound being slightly more tacky and having different flow characteristics during moulding, ie it is less viscous, which leads in turn to a tendency for greater porosity in mouldings produced. Use of the filler treated as in the present invention enables a moulding compound with good homogeneous dispersion of the thermoplastic polymeric material to be made without this deterioration of the flow characteristics during moulding, and without the extra tackiness.
