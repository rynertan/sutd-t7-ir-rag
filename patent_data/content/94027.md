# Method and apparatus for indicating misregister of overlapping printed images.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus are disclosed for indicating and correcting misregister of plural overlapping images produced by a multicolor press. A register indicia Fig. 3 is used com prising two overlapping sets of parallel lines R and C , each set being formed in a known position relative to a correspond ing one of the images whereby the positional relationship be tween the sets of lines varies with the positional relationship of the images. The extent of overlap of the sets of lines is de pendent upon displacement of the sets of lines in a direction transverse to the lines, whereby the percentage of nonprint area in the register indicia is dependent upon register of the overlapping images in that transverse direction. The percen tage of nonprint area is detected by illuminating the register in dicia area and measuring the extent to which the area reflects the light. The resulting signal is used to control the register ad justment mechanisms of the multicolor press.
