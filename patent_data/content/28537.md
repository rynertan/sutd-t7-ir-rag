# Apparatus for developing a latent image and electrostatographic printing machine incorporating same.

## Abstract
Development apparatus 36 for developing a latent image by transporting by magnetic brushes 38, 40 a conduc tive developer material comprising marking particles into contact therewith successive times. During the first contact time, the conductivity of the developer material optimizes development of solid areas within the latent image with mark ing particles. The last contact time occurs with a developer material having a lower conductivity than the development material employed during the first contact time. In this way, development of lines within the latent image with marking particles is optimized during this latter contact time.
