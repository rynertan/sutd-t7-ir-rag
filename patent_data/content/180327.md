# Assay method involving a phase separation, and kit therefor.

## Abstract
Improved binding assay methods involving determining the presence of analytes in samples through enzymatic formation of detectable substances in amounts related to the amount of analyte present in the sample and monitoring for the presence of the substances in distinct phases. Methods according to the invention include use of labelled materials which associate with the analyte to be determined or compete with the analyte for association with an added binder. The labelled materials employed include label portions which enzymatically from sub stances from substrates provided in or existing as a first phase, or, upon enzymatic treatment in a first phase, disassociate into substances capable of existing in or as a second distinct phase. Formation of the detectable substances is monitored by deter mining the transfer of the substance to a second distinct phase in contact with the first phase or by determining formation of a second distinct phase. The improved assays are useful in deter mining human IgG protein in blood samples and other con stituents of blood or other biological samples without elaborate instrumentation, allowing for practice outside the clinical laboratory.
