# Method of filling fluidizable material in flexible containers.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method of filling fluidiz able material in flexible containers. This implies that immediate ly after the filling operation the container filled with fluidizable material will not be stable. In order to obtain a simple and safe filling operation and at the same time simplify the further trans port of the filled container, the bottom plane 6 during the fill ing operation itself and immediately afterwards is adjusted to an angle y of at least 2 with the horizontal plane and a sup port means 4 is adjusted to an angle of at least 2 with the vertical plane such that the container 1 leans back against the support means when it is filled with fluidizable material and does not slide off the bottom plane 6 even when its lifting loops are released from the holding device. The bottom plane and the support means can comprise a unit in which the bot tom plane forms about 90 with the rear wall 5 of the support means 4. The angles x and y can be equal or different and pre ferred values for these angles are 5 15 .
