# X ray generator with phase advance voltage feedback.

## Abstract
An X ray generator system is provided with a high voltage feedback loop for controlling the output of an inverter to thereby maintain a desired output voltage level. The voltage feedback loop is provided with a phase advance network to selectively vary the gain of the system in such a way as to provide for high gain during the initial stage so as to obtain a short rise time, while subsequently reducing the gain so as to clamp the kV overshoot at the end of the rise time. A phase lag network is also included to effectively eliminate noise that is introduced by the phase advance network.
