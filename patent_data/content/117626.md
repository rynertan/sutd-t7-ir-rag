# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO ADAPTIVE FILTER ARRANGEMENTS

## Abstract
An extended impulse response characterisitic is obtained by connecting a plurality of adaptive filters 101 or echo cancelers in a tandem connection. Delay units 102 are associated with receive inputs X of the adaptive filters or echo cancelers so that each filter or canceler models a predetermined fixed portion of the extended impulse response characteristic. The relative positions of the filters or cancelers in the tandem connection are controll ably switched via 103 0 to 103 N 1 and 104 at a predeter mined rate via 105 to ensure so called good adaptation of the individual adaptive filters or echo cancelers. The adaptive filter or echo canceler in a preferred position in the tandem connection may be allowed to adapt at its normal rate while the other filters or cancelers are inhibited via
