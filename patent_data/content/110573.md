# Polyamide compositions.

## Abstract
The high temperature aging of polyamides is substan tially improved by incorporating therein an antioxidant and an oxide of a metal of Group II or III of the Periodic Table, preferably a synthetic zeolite. The total amount of antioxi dant and metal oxide is at least 1 , preferably 1 to 5 , and the amount of metal oxide is preferably 0.5 to 5 . Poly amides which can be stabilized in this way include Nylon 6, Nylon 11 and Nylon 12.
