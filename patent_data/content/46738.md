## Description
Description of the invention entitled HEAD WI2H COMBS in the name of OFFICINE SAVIO S.p.A.submitted on under No. This invention concerns head v.mth combs to be more exact, the invention concerns a head with combs with a double needle field, suitable for processing textile fibres. The so called screw type and chain type heads with combs are knovm the disk heads and rotation. comb heads are. also knor.n. The disk heads, designated commercially as rotary heads, are suitable for processing fibres cut to a wool staple len gth in a preliminary combing operation or for half combed fibres. These disk heads can be used advantageously for the first and second preparatory passes, and the regularity of the sliver coming out roz these disk heads is in itself poor. Moreover, the disk heads involve setting difficulties at the start of the batch and, although they can wOrIr theor etically at up to a maximum, of 300 350 metres a minu.te, in zctual fact their operating speed is not higher than a seed at least 15 20 below that level. The rotating comb heads, fcr wich the present author has submitted relative applications for patents, are instead suitable for processing fibres of wo6l and or cotton staple length. This type of head comprises a working field greater than that which can be obtained vith the rotary disk heads,.but said field is still not big. The limitations to the application of these heads,vzhich offer a high processing speed, spring from the short working field of the needles in processing the sliver being worked. To obviate the technical shortcomings inherent in the rotary heads and disk heads, chain tyne gill boxes have been designed. Chain type gill boxes involve the substantial dravi back of not ensuring the ability to regulate the material leaving them.This lack of ability to regulate the sliver arises from the fact that the chain drive permits an elong ation of the chain and needs continuous adjustment. Chain type gill boxes also involve the shortcoming, as compared, for example, to the rotary head gill box of the present author, of offering a limited field of use and of providing a considerably worse technological performance. Gill boxes have also been proposed which have combingmats of serrated rubber, or smooth combing mats, or drawing mats of which the upper one is of serrated rubber while the lower has steel combs. But in practice these gill boxes can only be used in the third pass and with fibres vith a large yarn count and half conbed fibres. As these gill boxes havethe fibres gripped elastically, they cannot be used in other passes and, in any event, offer a limited field of use. To obviate the problem of the elongation of the chain and the other problems of knov.n gill boxes, a gill box has also been proposed v rith substantially cylindrical bars thrust continuously into the working area, whereby one bar is linked to another vith a connecting element and the orien tation of the needles is obtained by making the bars rotate on their own axis by means of a lever. This system too involves shortcomings ovJing to elong . ation, to wear and to combined bending and compression force or stress exercised on the plurality of bars, which therefore have to be checked constantly as regards both their state of maintenance and their temporary position. Purthermore, in this knovn solution each bar itself has to perform all the functions of guiding, positioning and orienting and becomes stressed in a dynamic manner too to a very high degree. Next, this knovn solution involves considerable main tenance and replacement problems. Lastly, this knovm solution is not able to bring about an entry of the needles into the sliver being processed and a departure of the same therefrom such as gill not interfere with the mass of the fibres in an irregular manner. The present invention tends to improve the known sys .tems, and said improvements are aimed at the accomplishment of a plurality of advantages. A first advantage is the attainment of better and hige er working speeds. A second advantage is the obtaining of a better quality in the sliver processed. Yet another advantage is the accomplishment of an im proved and even penetration of the bars into the material.A further advantage is an improved departure of the bars from the material being processed.Another advantage again is to obtain a simple device, easy to control and maintain, reliable in the long term and very strong. According to the invention the problems connected with the elongation of the chain are wholly eliminated, as also are those linked to the specific stresses acting on the bare in the known types. Other problems are also eliminated, as will be seen hereinafter in the description. According to one formulation of the invention, two op posed series ef blocks suitably shaped and predisposed side by side to form the series, are thrust by coordinated sproc kets. This plurality of blocks side by side can perhaps, but not necessarily, be mutually connected to each other by a ring which only serves to carry out a function of auxiliary .connection between neighbouring blocks. According to the invention the blocks are moved by thrust said thrust can be exercised vsithout difficulty and without conseojuences since the bearing surface of the blocks can be dimensioned as desired. The blocks are envisaged as being in facing pairs so as to form two coordinated and op posed series closed ringwise. According to the invention the blocks include in their facing sides some appropriate grooves within which are in serted some needle bars which can move on one of their lengthwise vertical surfaces. Said needle bars cooperate with an appropriate guide cam groove lying on a plane at right angles to the length wise axis of the bars themselves and lying near the peri phery of transit of the individual pluralities of blocks. This guide cam groove cooperates with the bars and conditions their temporary oositioning in respect of the carrying blocks and of the sliver of fibres to be processed The blocks too are conditioned advantageously, in at least one tract of their course, by at least one system of guide cams able to ensure the desired positioning of the blocks themselves. The course of the blocks lies substantially near the tangents to two or more activation and guide sprockets,whiie the course of the needle bearing bars can be varied as utished to suit the conformation of the cams as predisposed and as constituting said groove cooperating with them. The invention permits a considerable movement of the bars, that is, a considerable vertical displacement thereof and, therefore, a considerable penetration by the needles.It also permits a relative speed,ad justable as wished, of penetration of the needles into the sliver of fibres. It permits, besides, an appreciable relative speed of .departure of the needles during the phase of release of the sliver of fibres, and the departure of the needles can take place substantially in direction at right angles to the .axis of feed of the sliver. The departure of the needles in a direction at right angles to the axis of feed of the sliver is facilitated by the conformation of the blocks. It can be further facilita ted by one or more possible and advantegeous lateral con formations in the blocks, these conformations cooperating with one or more holding and positioning cams. According to the invention the needle bearing bars can be readily replaced, being substantially independent of the blocks for there is only a lengthwise bond of thrust bet ween blocks and bars, and the bars are free to move vertical ally within the grooves present in said blocks. According to the invention the blocks do not involve substadtial .wear problems because they provide the possibil ity of suitable and widely different dimensioning and also because of the way in which they are made to work. Moreover, according to the invention the upper needle afield can be opened with a fulcrum as vvished so as to enable the gill box to be examined, regulated and set without any difficulty. The conformation allowed by the invention next maRes it possible that during the phase of closure of the two needle fields no special attention is needed for setting them in cooperation and phase since this takes place auto matically owing to the system embodied for the transmission of motion. Furthermore, the chamber defined by the plurality of needle bearing bars can be readily put under pressure, and in this way a noteworthy cleanliness and a facilitated de tachment of the fibres from the needles are obtained. It is also possible to carry out special or specific treatments of the sliver by means of fluid under pressure containing additives or not. moreover, the area there the needles arrive most, or else the only area where the needles arrive, when subjected to said action of pressurizing the chamber, can be readily limited and defined and can be localized at one or more points, which can also be subjected to differing pressures Besides, according to the invention only one head with combs can be used without the cooperation of the other head. The invention is embodied, therefore, in a head with combs, which is advantageously a head with combs with double needle field, for the processes of drawing and combing slivers of textile fibres, whereby the upper needle field can be opened as wished and provision is made for devices for cleaning the needles, suction groups and drawing and feeding groups, and whereby the needles are caused to move forward by an action of thrust, said head being characters ized by the fact that every needle field comprises a double opposed plurality, closed ringwise, of blocks placed side by side and perhaps connected together, which are thrust by sprocket means positioned at least upstream from said needle field, whereby said opposed blocks are in pairs and there is envisaged in the inner opposed faces of said blocks a ve r tically oriented hollow within which a needle bearing bar is lodged in a movable manner, and whereby the course of said blocks cooperates in at least part of their course with fixed cam means and the vertical positioning of said needle bearing bars is conditioned by a trajectory determined by fixed cam means. With the help of the attached tables let us now see a preferential formulation of the invention given as a non restrictive example. In the table we have as follows Fig. I shows diagrammatically a lengthwise middle section of a gill box according to the invention Fig. 2 shows a crosswise section of part of the control head of one of the two needle fields .Pig. 3 gives a three quarter view of two blocks with one bar Figs. 4 and 5 show the blocks and bars at the outgoing zo ne Fig. 6 shows possible means for putting the chambers under pressure Fig. 7 shows a detail of the bars. Referring to the figures, we have the following the gill box 10 consists of upper II and lower I2 needle fields. The gill box next comprises a known feed system with two or more rollers 13 and a knov.n drawing system at the outlet with two or more rollers 14. The gill box also includes knorm cleaning means 15 co operating, or not, with known suction means I6, the means .for cleaning the teeth of the combs being of any desired type, shape and conformation. According to the invention the gill box 10 can be open ed in the direction 117 with its fulcrum at 17, and in this way there is no difficulty in having access to the needle afield II or needle field I2 as necessary. The invention en visages the employment of the blocks I8, which work by thrust, the thickness of said blocks 18 constituting substan tially the step 19 of the hypothetical chain 20 closed ring .wise, in our example, around the sprockets 25 and 26. The blocks 18 can be merely positioned side by side and therefore free from each other or be positioned side by side and connected together by chain elements 2I, or belt elements not shown here. In this case too the step 19 is decided by the thick ness of the blocks 18. Fig. 3 shows diagrammntically two blocks 18 connected together with chain elements 21, the step of the chain ele ments 21 being, as said earlier, substantially the same as the thickness of the blocks I8. The blocks 18 comprise on one of their sides some slots or hollows 22 oriented substantiallyvwertically, within which are inserted the end parts 123 of the bars or combs 23 bear .ing the needles 24. The end parts 123 can slide along the hollows 22 but cannot be displaced sideways. For each needle field II and 12 two rows of blocks I8 .are envisaged, being wound in a catenary around the sprockets 25 and 26, which rotate in the direction 26. As said earlier, the blocks 18 include in their facing asides the slots 22, so that the combs 23 are guided at their .ends I23 by said slots 22, the slots 22 and end parts 123 of the combs 23 being suitably at an angle to the needles 24 and to the working plane of the needles 24. The sprockets 25 and 26 cooperate with appropriate pin or ridge means 27 in the blocks I8, so that said pin or rid .ge means 27 constitute subztantially the links of a chain with a step 19 substantially the same as the thickness of the blocks I8. The sprocket 25 is the drive sprocket, and its direction of rotation 28 has the effect that, as said before, the bars are thrust, one by the next, into the working field of the needles. The bars 23 slide on a path delimited on its outside by the course 29 and on its inside by the course 30. Said path delimited by the courses 29 and 30 conditions the specific position of the bars 23, which is also affected by the conformation of the bars 23 themselves and of the end part I23 of the bars themselves. The blocks 18 can include advantageously some arms 118 which slide, for at least a tract of their course, on an appropriate surface 142 and serve to keep the blocks 18 themselves steady. Said arms 118 can be envisaged for every two or more blocks I8. The surface 142 can be envisaged as having guide cam functions only on part of the course of the blocks 18 and can also be conformed with a hollow 242 at least in certain tracts so as to restrict the swinging of the blocks I8 them .selves. Owing to their conformation itself the bars 18 thrust, one against another, with their substantially parallel fa .ces 34 and 35 in the straight tracts, whereas in the curved .tracts see Figs. 4 and 5 they thrust with their back, 36 cooperating with the hollow 33. The blocks 18 run on a path delimited on its outside by the course 42 and on its inside by the course 43. The blocks I8 cooperate with the course 42 by means of their .free head 31. To facilitate the fullest and voidest journey for the bars 23, the blocks 18 comprise a cutaway portion 218,vich enables the bar 23 oi the proceding block I8 to extend above the following block 18 see Fig. 4 . The cutaway portion 21 is at least as deep as the hollow 22. According to the invention the sprocket 25 is moved by .a shaft 38 rich sets in rotation both the sprockets 25 of .a needle field. Said shaft 38 may comprise a bore 39 within which somefluid under pressure is made to flow through 40 so as to put and keep under pressure the chamber 41 formed by the needleafield itself. The holes 139 envisaged in the shaft 38 for discharging the fluid under pressure can cooperate with one or more spe .cific zones of the needle field, or with one or more specific zones of the bars 23, or with one or more specific zones ofthe course of the bars 23, or else near to the cams which de 1imit the course of the blocks 18 and or bars 23. To replace the holes 39 in the side walls of the cham bers 41 there may also be envisaged inlet holes 139 239 or drilled conduits for the immission of fluid under pressure, .the purpose in both cases being to keep the chambers 41 under pressure. . Said conduits 139 239 can deliver fluid under press ure generically into the chamber 41 or into specific zones, for instance, in cooperation with the zone 44 of the detach ment of the needles from the mass of fibres being processed. The chamber 41 can include baffles 141 able to delimit specifitally the zones of the outlet of the fluid under pres .sure from the chamber 41. The chamber 41 can also be divided into zones having differentiated pressures. The timing and setting of the gill box according to the invention is extremely easy in that the shafts 38 are activsated by gear wheels 37 directly meshed therewith and there fore not causing alignment or adjustment problems, the align ment and adjustment having already been arranged during thedesign work. Therefore, when the gill box IO is opened according to 117, during the closure phase there are the same gear wheels 37 as those which provide for the automatic timing of the needle fields.As said earlier, the combs 23 are inserted in the holes lows 22. Said combs 23 slide with their ends I23 within thehollows 22 which serve for their lengthv.ise drawing, where as their crosswise position is determined by the preferent ial course formed by the cams 29 and 30.Said preferential course, in cooperation with the conformation of the bars 23and in cooperation with the courses 42 and 43 that condition the blocks 18, determines the gradual and progressive ap proach of the needles 24 into The two needle fields II and 12 and determines the rapid and perpendicular departure of the needles 24 themselves at the end 44 of the working field, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. As shown in Figs. I 4 5 the zone 44 of the course .42 is conformed advantageously in such a way as to determine .a departure of the needles 24 in a substantially normal man inner, that is, substantially perpendicularly to the sliver as it is processed. This conformation, in copperation with the course impo sed on the blocks I8 by the guide cams 42, 43 and 142, en .ables a very short spacing to be obtained that is to say, it makes it possible to obtain a minimum distance between .the grip of the drawing device 14 and the release of the fibres of the needles 24. This minimum distance is about 20 .27 mm. and thus enables yarns with a very short cotton sta ple length to be processed. In the body 45 which determines the course 28, an ele ment 46 Fig. I can be envisaged perhaps one per side which can be removed so as to enable the combs 23 to be rea dily and quickly replaced by withdrawing them from the holes lows 22 in the blocks I8. According to the invention the blocks I8 can also not rest on the path 30 in the tract in cooperation with the sprockets 25 and 26. Eloreover, the geometric conformation of the blocks 18 can reflect the dimensions of the sprockets 25 and 26 as well as the course of departure from the needle field. Furthermore, the sprockets 25 and 26 can be mutually connected so as to facilitate the movement of the blocks 18 around the sprocket 26. Again, before the needle fields II and 12 a suitable taker in 217 can be visualized which is able to guide and condense the sliver of fibres to be processed. In addition, according to the invention the crosswise conformation of the blocks I8 may reflect specific design requirements, and therefore said part is irrelevant in it self for the purposes of the invention itself. The conformations of the groups transmitting motion and of the groups sustaining the shafts 38 can be readily modified to meet specific design requirements and have therefore been shown in the tables but not described. According to the invention only one needle field II or I2 can be employed without the cooperation of the other 12 or II. In this case the transmission of motion for instan ce, gear wheel 37 can undergo modifications which are even substantial but vich are irrelevant regarding the idea of the solution. We have described here a preferential solution, but variants are possible within the scope of theZidea of the sol ution without departing thereby from the invention. Thus it is possible to vary shapes and dimensions and to add, replace or integrate parts and to envisage altern ative parts, and so on. These and other variants are all possible for a technician in this field.
