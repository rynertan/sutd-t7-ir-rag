# Solution process for preparing metal salt esters of hydrocarbyl substituted succinic acid or anhydride and alkanols.

## Abstract
A solution process is disclosed for preparing a solubilized metal salt ester by reacting an ester compound, such as 2,2 thiodiethyl bis octadecenyl succinate ester, with a metal car boxylate, such as calcium acetate, in the presence of a mixture of a a first co solvent and or third co solvent, such as toluene and or dodecylbenzene respectively, and b a second co solvent such as methanol, to form the metal salt ester product and an effluent mixture of an acid, such as acetic acid, optional co solvent first, and second co solvent, followed by the op tional addition of a third co solvent, and vacuum distilling the resulting mixture to remove the effluent mixture to produce a solution of the product and third co solvent.
