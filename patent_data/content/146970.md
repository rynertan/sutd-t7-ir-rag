## Description
This invention relates to a radiation image storage panel employing a divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor containing a small amount of calcium and to the use of said phosphor in a radiation image recording and reproducing method. Recently, it has been found that a divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor BaFX Eu² , in which X is at least one halogen selected from the group consisting of Cℓ, Br and I absorbs and stores a portion of radiation energy when exposed to a radiation such as X rays, and emits light in the near ultraviolet to blue region when excited with an electromagnetic wave within a wavelength region of 450 900 nm after exposure to the radiation, that is, the phosphor shows a stimulated emission the peak wavelength of the stimulated emission is within the region of 385 405 nm, depending upon the kind of halogen which is a component of the phosphor . In particular, the divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor has been paid much attention and investigated as a phosphor employable for a radiation image storage panel i.e., stimulable phosphor sheet which is used in a radiation image recording and reproducing method utilizing a stimulable phosphor. A radiation image storage panel has a basic structure comprising a support and at least one phosphor layer provided on one surface of the support, which comprises a binder and a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein. Further, a transparent protective film is generally provided on the free surface surface not facing the support of the phosphor layer to keep the phosphor layer from chemical deterioration or physical shock. The radiation image recording and reproducing method using the above described radiation image storage panel comprising the stimulable phosphor is a very advantageous method replacing the conventional radiography. As described, for example, in U S A 4,239,968, the method involves steps of causing the stimulable phosphor of the panel to absorb radiation energy having passed through an object or having radiated from an object exciting the stimulable phosphor with an electromagnetic wave such as visible light and infrared rays hereinafter referred to as stimulating rays to sequentially release the radiation energy stored in the stimulable phosphor as light emission stimulated emission photo electrically detecting reading out the emitted light to obtain electric signals and reproducing a visible image from the electric signals on a recording material such as a photosensitive film or on a display device such as CRT cathode ray tube display device . In the radiation image recording and reproducing method, a radiation image can be obtained with a sufficient amount of information by applying a radiation to the object at considerably smaller dose, as compared with the case of using the conventional radiography. Accordingly, this radiation image recording and reproducing method is of great value especially when the method is used for medical diagnosis. The operation of reading out the radiation energy stored in the radiation image storage panel in the above described method is generally carried out by the steps of scanning the panel with a laser beam stimulating rays to sequentially excite the stimulable phosphor so as to release the radiation energy stored therein as light emission and detecting the light by a photosensor such as a photomultiplier. In the last step of the read out operation, the light which is continuously emitted by the stimulable phosphor of the radiation image storage panel after terminating the excitation with stimulating rays namely, afterglow of stimulated emission causes a decrease of the S N ratio of the resulting image. More in detail, the afterglow given by the phosphor particles other than the phosphor particles aimed to excite is detected as the light emitted by the aimed ones in the case that the phosphor gives afterglow in a relatively high ratio to the amount of the stimulated emission. As a result, the image provided by the radiation image storage panel comprising such a stimulable phosphor tends to be deteriorated on the image quality sharpness or density resolution . The afterglow characteristics of the panel varies depending not only on the employed stimulable phosphor but also on the intensity of stimulating rays and the scanning speed in the case of using a laser beam as the stimulating rays. In practical use, the affect of afterglow on the image quality further varies depending upon the detecting procedure of stimulated emission. Nevertheless, it is of great value to improve the afterglow characteristics of the panel which give an adverse effect to the image quality, even if the improvement is not so high. The radiation image recording and reproducing method using a radiation image storage panel comprising a stimulable phosphor is a very advantageous method as described above, and the method is desired to show a sensitivity as high as possible. The sensitivity of the panel to a radiation generally increases as the luminance of stimulated emission of the phosphor employed therefor increases. Accordingly, it is desired that the luminance of stimulated emission of the phosphor is as high as possible. FR A 286872 discloses a process for the preparation of a phosphor having the formula Me It is the object of the present invention to provide a radiation image storage panel which is enhanced in the sensitivity as well as in the quality of the image provided thereby. Said object is achieved by the use of a divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor having the formula I in which X is at least one halogen selected from the group consisting of Cℓ, Br and I and The divalent europuum activated barium fluorohalide phosphor having the above formula I used in the present invention has remarkably improved afterglow characteristics particularly in a period of 10 ³ 10 ² s after excitation with stimulating rays. It has further been confirmed that the phosphor used in the present invention gives stimulated emission of high luminance when excited with an electromagnetic wave having a wavelength within the range of 450 900 nm after exposure to a radiation such as X rays. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the radiation image recording and reproducing method can be enhanced and an image of high quality can be stably obtained, by using the radiation image storage panel of the present invention employing the above mentioned divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor.

From the viewpoint of improving the luminance of the stimulated emission and the afterglow characteristics thereof, the number for From the viewpoint of both the luminance of stimulated emission and afterglow characteristics, the number for A radiation image storage panel having a phosphor layer which comprises a Ba In Fig. 2. the solid curve indicates the relationship between the As is evident from Fig. 2, the radiation image storage panel containing the Ba It has been confirmed that radiation image storage panels employing other divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphors having the formula I than the above mentioned one have the same tendencies on the afterglow characteristics and sensitivity as described above. The amount of calcium The divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor used in the invention has the above mentioned formula I , and other various components may be further incorporated into the phosphor in the preparation thereof, so far as they do not reduce the effect based on the incorporation of Ca i.e., the improvement of afterglow characteristics and enhancement of the luminance of stimulated emission . Phosphors containing such additive components are included in the phosphor used in the invention. Examples of the additive component include the following substances The incorporation of metal oxides as described in the above mentioned The divalent europium activated barium flurohalide phosphor used in the present invention having the formula I can be prepared, for instance, by a process described below. As the starting materials, the following materials 1 to 4 can be employed In the first place, the above mentioned starting materials 1 to 4 are mixed in the stoichiometric ratio corresponding to the formula II in which X, The mixing procedure is conducted, for instance, by mixing the starting materials in the form of a suspension. From the suspension of the starting material mixture, the solvent e.g., water is removed to obtain a dry mixture in a solid form. The removal of solvent is preferably conducted at room temperature or a higher temperature for instance, not higher than 200 C by drying under reduced pressure and or vacuum. The mixing procedure is by no means restricted to this one. In the second place, the obtained dry mixture is finely pulverized, and the pulverized mixture is then placed in a heat resistant container such as a quartz boat or an alumina crucible and fired in an electric furnace. The firing procedure is conducted at a temperature of 500 1300 C for 0.5 6 h under a weak reducing atmosphere such as a nitrogen gas atmosphere containing a small amount of hydrogen gas or a carbon dioxide gas atmosphere containing carbon monoxide gas. When the employed europium compound contains trivalent europium, the trivalent europium is reduced to divalent europium under a weak reducing atmosphere in the firing stage. After firing the mixture of starting materials for the phosphor as described above, the fired product is taken out of the electric furnace, allowed to stand for cooling and pulverized. The pulverized product may be further fired second firing . The second firing is conducted at a temperature of 500 800 C for 0.5 12 in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen gas atmosphere or an argon gas atmosphere, or in the above mentioned weak reducing atmosphere. After the firing is complete, a powdery phosphor is obtained. The obtained phosphor may be processed in a conventional manner involving a variety of procedures for the preparation of phosphors such as a washing procedure, a drying procedure and a sieving procedure, if desired. The above described process gives the divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor having the aforementioned formula I . In the case that the phosphor used in the present invention contains such additive components as described above, the additive components are incorporated into the suspension in the mixing procedure of the starting materials for the phosphor or into the dry mixture prior to the firing stage. The radiation image storage panel of the present invention will be described hereinafter. The radiation image storage panel basically comprises a support and a phosphor layer provided thereon, which comprises a binder and a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein. The phosphor layer can be formed on the support, for instance, by the following procedure. In the first place, the stimulable phosphor particles prepared as described above and a binder are added to an appropriate solvent, and then they are mixed to prepare a coating dispersion which comprises the phosphor particles homogeneously dispersed in the binder solution. Examples of the binder to be contained in the phosphor layer include natural polymers such as proteins e.g. gelatin , polysaccharides e.g. dextran and gum arabic and synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl acetate, nitrocellulose, ethylcellulose, vinylidene chloride vinylchloride copolymer, polymethyl methacrylate, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, polyurethane, cellulose acetate butyrate, polyvinyl alcohol, and linear polyester. Particularly preferred are nitrocellulose, linear polyester, polyalkyl meth acrylate, a mixture of nitrocellulose and linear polyester, and a mixture of nitrocellulose and polyalkyl meth acrylate. These binders may be crosslinked with a crosslinking agent. Examples of the solvent employable in the preparation of the coating dispersion include lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol and n butanol chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and ethylene chloride ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone esters of lower alcohols with lower aliphatic acids such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and butyl acetate ethers such as dioxane, ethylene glycol monoethylether and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and mixtures of the above mentioned compounds. The mixing ratio of the binder to the stimulable phosphor in the coating dispersion can be determined according to the characteristics of the aimed radiation image storage panel and the nature of the phosphor employed. Generally, the ratio is within the range of from 1 1 to 1 100 binder phosphor, by weight , preferably from 1 8 to 1 40. The coating dispersion may contain a dispersing agent to improve the dispersibility of the phosphor particles therein, and may contain a variety of additives such as a plasticizer for increasing the bonding between the binder and the phosphor particles in the phosphor layer. Examples of the dispersing agent include phthalic acid, stearic acid, caproic acid and a hydrophobic surface active agent. Examples of the plasticizer include phosphates such as triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate and diphenyl phosphate phthalates such as diethyl phthalate and dimethoxyethyl phthalate glycolates such as ethylphthalyl ethyl glycolate and butylphthalyl butyl glycolate and polyesters of polyethylene glycols with aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as polyester of triethylene glycol with adipic acid and polyester of diethylene glycol with succinic acid. The coating dispersion containing the phosphor particles and the binder prepared as described above is applied evenly onto the surface of a support to form a layer of the coating dispersion. The coating procedure can be carried out by a conventional method such as a method using a doctor blade, a roll coater or a knife coater. After applying the coating dispersion onto the support, the coating dispersion is then heated slowly to dryness so as to complete the formation of the phosphor layer. The thickness of the phosphor layer varies depending upon the characteristics of the aimed radiation image storage panel, the nature of the phosphor and the ratio of the binder to the phosphor. In general, the thickness of the phosphor layer is within the range of from 20 µm to 1 mm, and preferably within the range of from 50 to 500 µm. The phosphor layer can be provided on the support by the methods other than that given in the above. For instance, the phosphor layer is initially prepared on a sheet material false support such as a glass plate, a metal plate or a plastic sheet using the aforementioned coating dispersion and then the thus prepared phosphor layer is superposed on the genuine support by pressing or using an adhesive agent. The phosphor layer may consist of either a single layer or plural two or more layers. In the case of two or more phosphor layers, at least one layer contains the aforementioned divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor. In any cases of a single and plural layers, a variety of known stimulable phosphors can be employed in combination with the above phosphor. The support material employed in the present invention can be selected from those employable for the radiographic intensifying screens in the conventional radiography or those employable for the known radiation image storage panel. Examples of the support material include plastic films such as films of cellulose acetate, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, polyimide, triacetate and polycarbonate metal sheets such as aluminum foil and aluminum alloy foil ordinary papers baryta paper resin coated papers pigment papers containing titanium dioxide and papers sized with polyvinyl alcohol. From the viewpoint of characteristics of a radiation image storage panel as an information recording material, a plastic film is preferably employed as the support material of the panel of the invention. plastic film may contain a light absorbing material such as carbon black, or may contain a light reflecting material such as titanium dioxide. The former is appropriate for preparing a high sharpness type radiation image storage panel, while the latter is appropriate for preparing a high sensitivity type radiation image storage panel. In the preparation of a conventional radiation image storage panel, one or more additional layers are occasionally provided between the support and the phosphor layer so as to enhance the bonding strength between the support and the phosphor layer, or to improve the sensitivity of the panel or the quality of an image provided thereby sharpness and graininess . For instance, a subbing layer or an adhesive layer may be provided by coating polymer material such as gelatin over the surface of the support on the phosphor layer side. Otherwise, a light reflecting layer or a light absorbing layer may be provided by forming a polymer material layer containing a light reflecting material such as titanium dioxide or a light absorbing material such as carbon black. In the present invention, one or more of these additional layers may be provided on the support. As described in US A 496,278, the phosphor layer side surface of the support or the surface of an adhesive layer, light reflecting layer, or light absorbing layer in the case where such layers are provided on the phosphor layer may be provided with protruded and depressed portions for the enhancement of the sharpness of resulting image. The radiation image storage panel generally has a transparent protective film on the free surface of a phosphor layer not facing a support to protect the phosphor layer from physical and chemical deterioration. In the radiation image storage panel of the present invention, it is preferable to provide a transparent protective film for the same purpose. The protective film can be provided on the phosphor layer by coating the surface of the phospnor layer with a solution of a transparent polymer such as a cellulose derivative e.g., cellulose acetate or nitrocellulose , or a synthetic polymer e.g., polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, polycarbonate, polyvinyl acetate, or vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer , and drying the coated solution Alternatively, the protective film can be provided on the phosphor layer by beforehand preparing it from a polymer such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polyvinylidene chloride or polyamide, followed by placing and fixing it on the phosphor layer with an appropriate adhesive agent. The transparent protective film preferably has a thickness within the range of 3 to 20 µm. For the enhancement of sharpness of the resulting image, at least a portion of the radiation image storage panel may be colored with a colorant, as described in US A 4,394,581 and US A 326,642. For the same purpose, the phosphor layer of the radiation image storage panel according to the present invention may contain a white powder, as described in US A 4,350,893. The present invention will be illustrated by the following examples and comparison examples, but these examples by no means restrict the invention. To 500 ml of distilled water H₂O were added 175.34 g of barium fluoride BaF₂ , 333.18 g of barium bromide BaBr₂ 2H₂O and 0.783 g of europium bromide EuBr₃ , and they were mixed to give a suspension. The suspension was dried at 60 C under reduced pressure for 3h and further dried at 150 C under vacuum for another 3 Then, the mixture of the starting materials was placed in an alumina crucible, which was, in turn, placed in a high temperature electric furnace for firing. The firing was done at 900 C for 1.5 h in a carbon dioxide gas atmosphere containing a small amount of carbon monoxide gas. After the firing was complete, the crucible was taken out of the furnace and allowed to stand for cooling. The fired product was pulverized to obtain a powdery divalent europium activated barium fluorobromide phosphor Ba₀.₉₉,Ca₀.₀₁ FBr 0.001Eu² Further, a variety of divalent europium activated barium fluorobromide phosphors were obtained by varying the amount of calcium bromide to be added within the range of 10 ⁴ 10 ¹ mol per 1 mol of BaFBr in the above described preparation of the phosphor. Subsequently, using the obtained phosphors, a variety of radiation image storage panels were prepared in the following manner. To a mixture of the phosphor particles and a linear polyester resin were successively added methyl ethyl ketone and nitrocellulose nitrification degree 11.5 , to prepare a dispersion containing the phosphor particles. Then, tricresyl phosphate, n butanol and methyl ethyl ketone were added to the dispersion, and the mixture was sufficiently stirred by means of a propeller agitater to obtain a homogeneous coating dispersion containing the binder and the phosphor particles in the ratio of 1 20 binder phosphor, by weight and having a viscosity of 2,5 3,5Pa.s 25 35 PS at 25 C . Then, the coating dispersion was applied onto a polyethylene terephthalate sheet containing carbon black support, thickness 250 µm placed horizontally on a glass plate. The application of the coating dispersion was carried out using a doctor blade. After the coating was complete, the support having the coating dispersion was placed in an oven and heated at a temperature gradually rising from 25 to 100 C. Thus, a phosphor layer having a thickness of 200 µm was formed on the support. On the phosphor layer was placed a transparent polyethylene terephthalate film thickness 12 µm provided with a polyester adhesive layer to combine the film and the phosphor layer with the adhesive layer. Thus, a radiation image storage panel consisting essentially of a support, a phosphor layer and a transparent protective film was prepared. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except for adding no calcium bromide to obtain a powdery divalent europium activated barium fluorobromide phosphor BaFBr 0.001Eu² . Using thus obtained phosphor particles, a radiation image storage panel consisting essentially of a support, a phosphor layer and a transparent protective film was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1. The radiation image storage panels prepared in Example 1 and Comparison Example 1 were evaluated on the sensitivity and the afterglow characteristics according to the following tests. The radiation image storage panel was excited with a He Ne laser beam wavelength 632.8 nm after exposure to a radiation at 80 kV to measure the sensitivity thereof. The radiation image storage panel was cut to give a test strip having a width of 7 cm. The test strip was exposed to X rays at 80 kV and subsequently once scanned with a He Ne laser beam wavelength 632.8 nm in the direction of its width for 5x10 ³ s to measure the decay of afterglow of the stimulated emission. The results of the evaluation on the sensitivity and afterglow characteristics are graphically illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 illustrates graphs decay curves of afterglow in which the time is plotted as the abscissa and amount of afterglow amount of stimulated emission as the ordinate, Fig. 2 illustrates graphs on Ba In Fig. 2, the amount of afterglow is a value measured at 2x10 ³s after excitation with a Ne Ne laser beam. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except for adding 0.15 g of silicon dioxide SiO₂ as well as 0.83 g of calcium bromide to 100 g of the pulverized product, to obtain a powdery divalent europium activated barium fluorobromide phosphor Ba₀.₉₉,Ca₀.₀₁ FBr 0.006SiO₂ 0.001Eu² . Using the thus obtained phosphor particles, a radiation image storage panel consisting essentially of a support, a phosphor layer and a transparent protective film was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1. The radiation image storage panel prepared in Example 2 was evaluated on the sensitivity and the afterglow characteristics by the above described tests. As a result, the relative sensitivity and the logarithmic value of amount of afterglow amount of stimulated emission were respectively 1.2 and 3.5 for the radiation image storage panel containing Ba₀.₉₉,Ca₀.₀₁ FBr 0.006SiO₂ 0.001Eu² phosphor, though those were 0.1 and 2.9 for the radiation image storage panel of Comparison Example 1 containing BaFBr 0.001Eu² phosphor see Fig. 2 .
