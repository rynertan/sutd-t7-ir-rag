# Shoe stiffener.

## Abstract
The invention presents a shoe stiffener which comprises co extruded layers of plastics film, a first of the layers com prising an ionomeric material 34 and providing a main body of the stiffener and a second layer comprising a plastics ma terial 36 which does not adhere to a fusion press under conditions normally encountered therein during bonding of a shoe stiffener to a shoe upper. Nylon 6 is the preferred second layer plastics material. The co extrusion product re places fabric backed shoe stiffeners in which flaws induced in the film by the fabric may provide notches from which cracks in the material can propagate.
