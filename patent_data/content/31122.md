# Electromagnetic pickup cartridge.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic pickup cartridge in which a cantilever 3 with a stylus tip 2 at the free end thereof is extended perpendicularly from the center of one major surface of an armature 12 which is partially embedded in a holder 11 which is made of a high molecular compound, serves as a suspension part and in turn is mounted through a damper 6 in a sleeve. Since the armature 12 is not needed to be formed with a center aperture, the fabrication cost can be reduced.
