# Sequence generator for an electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
A sequence generator system is disclosed for use in an electronic musical instrument wherein scanning circuits scan the instrument and produce a serial data stream correspond ing to notes played on the instrument. The sequence generator system comprises sequence generating circuits 34, 44 ,52 responsive to the serial data stream for generating a further, predetermined data sequence and data steering circuits 30 for receiving the serial data stream and for nor mally steering said serial data stream to a data output. Actua tion of the system causes the data steering circuits 30 to substitute the predetermined data sequence produced by the sequence generating circuits 34, 44, 52 for the serial data stream at the data output.
