# Method for manufacturing a ground water flow restricting screen in the ground, and screen and apparatus for application of said method.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method for introducing a ground water flow restricting or sealing screen into the soil comprising several side by side mounted whether or not overlapping flexible sheets 13, 14, 15 which each are intro duced into the soil with their lower edges by being releasably connected to a lance 3 with substantially the same width and are sealed there to each other and anchored such that a continuous screen is formed, said lance 3 being retracted after the placing of each individual sheet, the sealing of the edges being performed by overlapping and or hardening material fed in at the location of said edge.
