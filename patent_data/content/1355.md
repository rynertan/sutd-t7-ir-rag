# Improvements in photographic printing exposure meters.

## Abstract
This invention relates to improvements in photographic printing exposure meters, and particularly to such a meter having a light sensitive cell 6 which produces an illuminance dependant electrical signal used in an electronic circuit, together with inputs 8, 11, 18 of other parameters of printing density, to calculate values of printing density corresponding to the input values. The parameters inputs are related to contrast grade 18 and speed index of photographic paper 11 , and time duration of exposure 8 to the illuminance given by the light sensitive cell 6 . The meter can be used to determine what exposure time is required, for a photographic paper having a particular contrast grade and speed index, to give a particular value of printing density at the measured illuminance.
