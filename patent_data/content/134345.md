# Body liquids drainage control method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A drainage control valve 10 is provided having a housing 11 inlet tube 16 and outlet tube 33 . A piston 22 includes a flexible valve seal 23 to close an inlet opening 26 under the action of return spring 25 . At a predeter mined inlet pressure the piston moves against the return spring to open communication between the inlet tube and outlet tube. The suction of fluid draining through the housing acts on the rear face of the piston to maintain the valve in the open condition until drainage is substantially complete.
