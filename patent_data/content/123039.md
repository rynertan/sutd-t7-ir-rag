# Signal detector.

## Abstract
A signal detector identifies a desired frequency compo nent having the greatest amplitude in an input signal contain ing other frequency components of smaller amplitude such as spurious noise, etc. This allows measuring for instance the frequency of the desired frequency component. The envelope of an intermediate frequency signal corresponding to the desired frequency component is set to be above a desired level in a single sweep of a local oscillator by comparing the envelope with a predetermined value for controlling the attenuation of the input signal. After the attenuation is thusly set, only the desired frequency component has an envelope larger than the predetermined value, so that the desired fre quency component is easily identified thereby in the next sweep.
