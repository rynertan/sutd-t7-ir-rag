# Method for spectral analysis of short optical pulses.

## Abstract
A method for the spectral analysis of short optical pulses 12 uses an optical group velocity dispersive medium 14 , for example, a low loss single mode optical fiber, to map the optical spectrum a of the pulse into the time domain c, d . One application of this method is used for obtaining a serial, time domain readout of information stored in a photoche mical hole burning memory which utilizes a medium with broad hole widths.
