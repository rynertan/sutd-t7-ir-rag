# SELF FEEDER FOR LIVESTOCK

## Abstract
A self feeder for livestock comprises a base member having a surface for receiving feed thereon and a hopper positioned thereabove. The hopper is adapted for containing feed therein and has a bottom with an aperture for allowing feed to flow therethrough and into the base member receptacle. A plurality of hopper support members are each connected respectively to the base member and the hopper and are also adapted for separating feeding animals. A feed wheel rotatably mounted in the receptacle includes an upright member rotatably mounted in the receptacle. The upright member extends through the hopper bottom aper ture with upper and lower portions respectively above and below the level of the hopper bottom. An agitating rod extends from the upright member upper portion for agitating feed within the hopper as the feed wheel is rotated. The feed wheel lower portion includes a spoke extending from the upright member which is movable by an animal to rotate the feed wheel. The spoke is also adapted for engaging a quantity of feed in the receptacle whereby rotation of the feed wheel is resisted.
