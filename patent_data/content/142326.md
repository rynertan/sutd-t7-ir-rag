# Liquid crystal display.

## Abstract
A ferro electric liquid crystal display is adapted for viewing by reflection of light from the display. Each cell 12 of the display has a transparent front electrode 14 and a reflective back electrode 13 . A polariser 17 is mounted in front of the display which is an odd number of quarter wavelengths in thickness. The polariser is orientated relative to the display to provide a maximum contrast ratio between the two cell conditions.

## Description
LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY This invention relates to liquid crystal displays and in particular to such displays having picture elements pixels comprising ferro electric liquid crystal cells disposed in an array on a silicon substrate. Such devices have lemployed liquid crystals that do not exhibit ferro electricity, and the material interacts with an applied electric field by way of an induced dipole. As a result they are not sensitive to the polarity of the applied field, but respond to the applied RMS voltage averaged over approximately one response time at that voltage. There may also be frequency dependence as in the case of so called two frequency materials, but this only affects the type of response produced by the applied field. In contrast to this a ferro electric liquid crystal exhibits a permanent electric dipole, and it is this permanent dipole which will interact with an applied electric field. Ferro electric liquid crystals are of interest in display applications because they are expected to show a greater coupling with an applied field than that typical of a liquid crystal that relies on coupling with an induced dipole, and hence ferro electric liquid crystals are expected to show a faster response. In particular the electro optical response time of a smectic C liquid crystal can be as much as 1000 to 10,000 times faster than a conventional non ferroelectric material. Conventionally liquid crystal cells employing a smectic C material have been viewed in transmission via a pair of polarisers whereby a suitable contrast ratio between the two states of the liquid crystal is obtained. A particularly advantageous construction of a ferro electric display is described in our co pendingEuropean Patent Application No.84307155.6 where the liquid crystal cells are disposed on a substrate comprising a silicon wafer incorporating the circuitry whereby the cells of the display are addressed and operated. As silicon is opaque at visible wavelength, it will be appreciated that such a display must be viewed in reflection. It is therefore necessary to provide means whereby the different optical properties of the two states of the ferro electric material may be viewed. According to the invention there is provided a ferro electric liquid crystal display, including a plurality of display cells disposed on a substrate, each cell comprising a metal back electrode and a transparent front electrode whereby a ferro electric liquid crystal material disposed therebetween may be switched between its two stable states, and a single polariser via which the display is viewed by specular reflection of light from the metal back electrodes, and wherein the optical thickness of each cell is equal to an odd number of quarter wavelength divided by the birefringence of the liquid crystal material. In use the orientation of the polariser relative to the display is subjected to achieve the optimum contrast ratio between the two display conditions. The arrangement may be used in a data terminal. An embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing in which the single figure is a cross sectional view of a portion of a ferro electric liquid crystal display. Referring to the drawing, the display is supported on a substrate 11 comprising, e.g. a silicon wafer and includes a plurality of cells 12 one for each element or pixel of the display. Each cell 12 includes a reflective metal back electrode 13 supported on the substrate, a transparent front electrode 14 supported on a transparent front panel 15 and a quantity of a ferroelectric liquid crystal 16 material disposed between the electrode. Typically the liquid crystal is a smectic C material, for example p hexyloxy benzylidene p amino 2 chloro Ã¡propyl cinnamate. Operation of the display may be effected by an addressing process such as that described in our co pending European PatentApplication No.84307155.6. In a typical construction the electrode 13 is coupled to the drain of a field effect transistor formed in the substrate 11 and comprising doped regions 21 and 22 defining a channel region therebetween. A gate electrode 23 is disposed in a silica layer 10 above the channel region of the transistor. The cell is operated by applying a control signal to the gate such that the back electrode 13 is driven to a positive or negative voltage relative to the front electrode 14. Although only a single cell is shown the display of course comprises a plurality of such cells disposed on a common substrate, e.g. in a rectangular array. A polariser 17 is mounted in front of the display, the orientation of the polariser being adjusted to provide maximum contrast ratio between the two states of the liquid crystal. In one condition of the cell the plane of polarisation of the reflected light corresponds to that of the polariser and the cell appears light. In the other condition the plane of polarisation is transverse to that of the polariser and the cell appears dark. The intensity F of light reflected from the display relative to the intensity Fo of incident light is given by the expression F Fo 1 sin24 o sin2 where o is the molecular tilt of the liquid crystal and is given by 2 n.d where n is the birefringence of the iiquid crystal, d is the cell thickness and is the wavelength of the incident light.Clearly this will give maximum reflection white display when 4 o 0, , 2 or o 0, 4, 2 and minimum reflection black display when 4 O 2, 3 2, 5 2 or 8 In fact with currently available materials the only tilt angle that is feasible for minimum reflection is s or 22.5 . 8 Again for minimum reflection, i.e. maximum contact ratio, , 3 ... For 2 2 2 we have d 4 and from 3 2 d A n.4 Thus the cell thickness should be equal to an dd number of quarter wavelengths divided by the birefringence. In a further embodiment the cell may contain a dichroic dye, the cell then appearing coloured or colourless in its two conditions.
