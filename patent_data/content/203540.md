## Description
L AMINODICARBOXYLIC ACID AMIDES OF SUBSTITUTED GAMINES AND A COMPOSITION CONTAINING THE SAME This invention relates to a novel group of compounds and more particularly to a novel group of compounds particularly well suited as sweeteners in edible foodstuff as well as a composition containing the same. Sweetness is one of the primary taste cravings of both animals and humans. Thus, the utilization of sweetening agents in foods in order to satisfy this sensory desire is well established. Naturally occuring carbohydrate sweeteners such as sucrose, are still the most widely used sweetening agents. While these naturally occurring carbohydrates, i.e., sugars, generally fulfill the requirements of sweet taste, the abundant usaqe thereof does not occur without deleterious consequence, e.g., high caloric intake and nutritional imbalance. In fact, often times the level or tese sweeteners required in foodstuffs is far greater than the level of the sweetener that is desired for economic, dietetic or other functional consideration. In an attempt to eliminate the disadvantages concomitant with natural sweeteners, considerable research and expense have been devoted to the production of artificial sweeteners, such as for example, saccharin, cyclamate, dihydrochalcone, aspartame, etc.While some of these artificial sweeteners satisfy the requirements o sweet taste without caloric input, and have met with considerable commercial success, they are not, however, without their own inherent disadvantages. For example, many of these artificial sweeteners have the disadvantages of high cost, as well as delay in the perception of the sweet taste, persistent lingering of the sweet taste, and very objectionable bitter, metallic aftertaste when used in food products. Since it is believed that many disadvantages of artificial sweeteners, particularly aftertaste, is a function of the concentration of the sweetener, it has been previously suggested that these effects could be reduced or eliminated by combining artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, with other ingredients such as aspartame or natural sugars, such as sorbitol, dextrose, maltose, etc. These combined products, however, have not been entirely satisfactory either.Some U.S. Patents which disclose sweetener mixtures include for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,228,198 U.S.Patent No. 4,158,068 U.S. Patent No. 4,154,862 andU.S. Patent No. 3,717,477. Accordingly, much work has continued in an attempt to develop and identify compounds that have a sweet taste and which will satisfy the need for better lower calorie sweeteners. Search continues for sweeteners that have intense sweetness, that is, deliver a sweet taste at low use levels and which will also produce enough sweetness at low levels to act as sole sweetener for most sweetener applications.Furthermore, the sweeteners soucht must have good temporal and sensory qualities. Sweeteners with good temporal qualities produce a time intensity sweetness response similar to natural sweeteners without lingering. Sweeteners with good sensory qualities lack undesirable off tastes and aftertaste. Furthermore, these compounds must be economical and safe to use. In U.S. Patent No. 3,798,204, L aspartyl O tbutyl L serine methyl ester and L aspartyl O t amylL serine methyl ester are described as sweet compounds having significant sweetness. In U.S. Patent No. 4,448,716 metal complex salts of dipeptide sweetners are disclosed. In the background of this patent a generic formula is described as an attempt to represent dipeptide sweeteners disclosed in five prior patents U.S. Patent No. 3,475,403 U.S. Patent No. 3,492,131 Republic of South AfricaPatent No. 695,083 published July 1G, 1969 Republic ofSouth Africa Patent No. 695,910 published August 14, 1969 and German Patent No. 2,054,554. The general formula attempting to represent these patents is as follows EMI3.1 wherein R represents the lower alkyls, lower alkylarls and cycloalkyls, n stands for integers 0 through 5, R1 represents a phenyl group, b lower alkyls, c cycloalkyls, d R2. Where R2 is hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl, halogen, e S O lower alkyl where m is 0, 1 or 2 and provided n is 1 or 2, f R3. Where R3 represents an hydroxy or alkoxy and g single or double unsaturated cycloalkyls with up to eight carbons. These compounds also are not entirely satisfactory in producing a high quality sweetness or in producing a sweet response at lower levels of sweetener.

European Patent Application 34,876 describes amides of L aspartyl D amino acid dipeptides of the formula EMI11.1 wherein Ra is methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl andR is a branched aliphatic, alicyclic or heterocyclic member which is branched at the alpha carbon atoms and also branched again at one or both of the beta carbon atoms.These compounds are indicated to be of significant sweetness. In the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1984,Vol. 27, o. 12, pp. 1663 8, are described various sweetener dipeptide esters, including L aspartyl alpha aminocycloalkane methyl esters. The various dipeptide esters o the prior art have been characterized as lacking significant stability at low H values and or thermal stability. These characterstics have limited the scope of use o these sweeteners in food products which are of low pH values or are prepared or served at elevated temperatures. Accordingly, it is desired to find compounds that provide quality sweetness when added to foodstuffs or pharmaceuticals at low levels and thus eliminate or greatly diminish the aforesaid disadvantages associated with prior art sweeteners. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present new compounds are amides of certain alpha aminodicarboxylic acids and substituted amino compounds.They are lower calorie sweeteners that possess a high order of sweetness with pleasing taste and higher stability at acid pH and elevated temperatures compared to known dipeptide sweeteners.

Tnese novel compounds are effective sweetness agents when used alone or in combination with other sweeteners in an ingesta, e.g., foodstuffs or pharmaceuticals. For example, other natural and or artificial sweeteners which may be used with the novel compounds of the present invention include sucrose, fructose, corn syrup solids, dextrose, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, acetosulfam, thaumatin, invert sugar, saccharin, thiophene saccharin, meta aminobenzoic acid, meta hydroxybenzoic acid, cyclaate, chlorosucrose, dihydrochalcone, hydrogenated glucose syrups, aspartame L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester and other dipeptides, glycyrrhizin and stevioside and the like.These sweeteners when employed with the sweetness agents of the present invention, it is believed, could produce synergistic sweetness responses. Furthermore, when the sweetness agents of the present invention are added to ingesta, the sweetness agents may be added alone or with nontoic carriers such as the abovementioned sweeteners or other food ingredients such as acidulants and natural and artificial gums. Typical foodstuffs, and pharmaceutical preparations, in which the sweetness agents of the present invention may be used are, for example, beverages including soft drinks, carbonated beverages, ready to mix beverages and the like, infused foods e.g. vegetables or fruits , sauces, condiments, salad dressings, juices, syrups, desserts, including puddings, gelatin and frozen desserts, like ice creams, sherbets, icings and flavored frozen desserts on sticks, confections, toothpaste, mouthwash, chewing gum, cereals, baked goods, intermediate moisture foods e.q. do food and the like. In order to achieve the effects of the present invention, the compounds described herein are generally added to the food product at a level which is effective to perceive sweetness in the food stuff and suitably is in an amount in the range of from about 0.0005 to 2 by weight based on the consumed product.Greater amounts are operable but not practical. Preferred amounts are in the range of from about Q.001 to about 1 of the foodstuff. Generally, the sweetenina effect provided by the present compounds are experienced over a wide pH range, e.g. 2 to 10 preferably 3 to 7 and in buffered and unbuffered formulations. It is desired that when the sweetness agents of this invention are employed alone or in combination with another sweetner, the sweetener or combination of sweeteners provide a sucrose equivalent in the range of from about 2 weight percent to about .0 weight percent and more preferably from about 3 weight percent to about 15 weight percent in the foodstuff or pharmceutical. A taste for determination of sweetness merely involves the determination of sucrose equivalency. Sucrose equivalence for sweeteners are readily determined. The amount of a sweetener that is equivalent to a given weight percent sucrose can be determined by having a panel of tasters taste solutions o a sweetener at known concentrations and match its sweetness to standard solutions of sucrose. In order to prepare compounds of the present invention, several reaction schemes may be employed. In one reaction scheme, compounds of general formula II a protected o aminodicarboxylic acid or acylating derivatives thereof, e.g., acid halides, anhydrides, esters, etc. and III are condensed to form compounds of general formula IV EMI22.1 In these, B is an amino protecting aroup, B is a carboxy protecting group, and A, , , Y, and n have the same meanina as previously described. A variety of protectina aroups known in the art may be employed. Examples of many of these possible groups may be found in Protective Groups inOrganic Synthesis by T.W. Green, John Wiley and Sons, 1981.Among the preferred groups that may be employed are benzyloxy carboxyl for A and benzyl for B. Coupling of compounds with general formula II to compounds having general formula III employs established techniques in peptide chemistry. One such technique uses dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC as the couplina aaent. TheDCC method may be employed with or without additives such as dimetyl aminoyridine or copper II . The DCC coupling reaction generally proceeds at room temperature, however, it may be carried out from about 20 to 500C. in a variety of solvents inert to the reactants. Thus suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, N,N dimethyl formamide, methylene chloride, toluene and the like. Preferably the reaction is carried out under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen.Coupling usually is complete within 2 hours but may take as long as 24 hours depending on reactants. Various other amide forming methods can be employed to prepare the desired compounds using suitable derivatives of the free carboxy group in compounds of structure II, e.g., acid halide, mixed anhydride with acetic acid and similar derivatives. The following illustrates such methods using aspartic acid as the amino dicarboxylic acid. One such method utilizes the reaction ofN protected aspartic anhydrides with the selected amino compound of formula III. Thus compounds of formula III can be reacted directly in inert organic solvents with L aspartic anhydride having its amino group protected by a formyl, carbobenzloxy, or p methoxycarbobenzloxy group which is subsequently removed after coupling to give compounds of general formula I. The N acyl L aspartic anhydrides are prepared by reacting the corresponding acids with acetic anhydride in amounts of 1.0 1.2 moles per mole of the N acyl L aspartic acid at 0 to 600C in an inert solvent. The N acyl L aspartic anhydrides are reacted with preferably 1 to 2 moles of compounds of formula III in an organic solvent capable of dissolving both and inert to the same.Representative solvents are ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl ether, N,N dimethylformamide and benzene. The reaction proceeds smoothly at 0 to 30 CC. The N acyl qroup is removed after coupling by catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon or with HBr or HC1 in a conventional manner. U.S. Patent 3,879,382 discloses that this coupling method can also be performed in an aqueous solvent at a temperature of 100 to 500C. and at a pH of 4 12. Alternatively, compounds of Formula I of the present invention can be prepared by reduction of the amido ketone of Formula V by using reducing agents known in the art, such as cerium borohydride followed by subsequent removal of the protecting groups, as follows EMI24.1 In these, B is an amino protecting group, B is a carboxy protecting group, and A, A , Y, and n have the same meanina as previously described. A variety of protecting groups known in the art may be employed. Examples of many of these possible groups may be found in Protective Groups inOrganic Synthesis by T.W. Green, John Wiley and Sons, 1981.Among the preferred groups that may be employed are benzyloxycarbonyl for A and benzyl for B. Compound V can be prepared through a chiral synthetic pathway wherein the chirality of the starting material is preserved. An exemplary scheme is as follows EMI24.2 wherein B is an amino protecting group, B is a carboxy protecting group, A, A , Y and n have the same meaning as previously described, X is a halogen, such as C1 or Br,D is an amino protecting group, such as triphenylmethyl and E is a carboxylic acid protecting group, such as pyridyl thio ester. In this procedure, a protected amino acid of Formula IX, such as N triphenyl methyl D alanine pyridyl thio ester is reacted with a Grignard reagent ofFormula VIII to produce the B amino ketone of Formula VII.The protecting group D, i.e., the triphenyl methyl group, can be easily removed by techniques known in the art, such as by treating the compound of Formula VII with oxalic acid and acetic acid. The resulting deprotected product is then coupled with a protected a aminodicarboxylic acid of Formula II in the usual fashion to form the product ofFormula V. The intermediate ketone of Formula V can also be prepared by condensing compounds of general Formula II a protected o aminodicarboxylic acid or acylating derivative thereof with a salt of an amino ketone ofFormula XII EMI25.1 Examplary salts of compounds of Formula XII include oxalates, malonates, succinates and the like. In these, B is an amino protecting group, B is a carboxy protecting group, and A, A , Y, and n have the same meaning as previously described. A variety of protecting aroups known in the art may be employed. Examples of many of these possible groups may be found in Protective Groups in OrganicSynthesis by T.W. Green, John Wiley and Sons, 1981. Among the preferred groups that may be employed are benzylcarbonxyl for A and benzyl for B. Coupling of compounds with general formula II to compounds having general formula XII employs established techniques in peptide chemistry. One such technique uses dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC as the coupling agent. TheDCC method may be employed with or without additives such as 4 dimethyl aminopyridine or copper II . The DCC coupling reaction generally proceeds at room temperature, however, it may be carried out from about 200 to 50 C. in a variety of solvents inert to the reactants. Thus suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, N,N dimethyl formamide, methylene chloride, toluene and the like. Preferably the reaction is carried out under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen. Coupling usually is complete within 2 hours but may take as long as 24 hours depending on reactants. Various other amide forming methods can be employed to prepare the desired compounds using suitable derivatives of the free carboxy group in compounds of structure II, e.g., acid halide, mixed anhydride with acetic acid and similar derivatives. The following illustrates such methods using aspartic acid as the amino dicarboxylic acid. One such method utilizes the reaction ofN protected aspartic anhydrides with the selected amino compound of formula XII. Thus compounds of formula XII can be reacted directly in inert oraanic solvents with L aspartic anhydride having its amino group protected by a formyl, carbobenzloxy, or p methoxycarbobenzloxy group which is subsequently removed after coupling to give compounds of general formu a I. The N acyl L aspartic anhydrides are prepared by reacting the corresponding acids with acetic anhydride in amounts of 1.0 1.2 moles per mole of the N acyl Laspartic acid at 0 to 600C in an inert solvent. TheN acyl L aspartic anhydrides are reacted with preferably 1 to 2 moles of compounds of formula XII in an organic solvent capable of dissolving both and inert to the same.Representative solvents are ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, tefirahydro uran, dioxane, ethyl ether, N,N dimethylformamide and benzene. The reaction proceeds smoothly at 0 to 300C.The N acyl group is removed after coupling by catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon or with HBr or HC1 in a conventional manner. U.S. Patent 3,879,372 discloses that this coupling method can also be performed in an aqueous solvent at a temperature of 10 to 500C. and at a pH of 4 12. Compounds of Formula XII can be prepared by techniques known in the art. In one reaction scheme, compounds of FormulaXII are prepared by oxidation of alkenes of Formula XI II using conventional oxidizing agents, such as peroxy acids, e.g., meta chloroperoxybenzoic acid EMI27.1 in which A, A , and Y are as defined above. The alkene XIII in turn is prepared from the reaction of a protected O4 amino aldehyde of Formula XIV and a Grignard reagent ofFormula XV, followed by dehydration and removal of the protecting group. EMI28.1 wherein B , A , and Y are as defined hereinabove and X is a halogen, such as bromide or chloride. Alternatively, compounds of Formula I can be prepared by selective reduction of the compounds of Formula XI by reduction techniques known in the art, such as by utilizing NaBH4 , LiA1H4 or by catalytic hydrogenation. This reduction involvos conversion of theEMI28.2 group toEMI28.3 Compounds in which A CH2OH are prepared by reduc tion of the carbo methoxy group in otherwise comparable products. Methoxy methyl compounds are prepared by methyla tion dimethylsulfate of those in which A CH2OH.. Compounds of Formula XI can be prepared by thc removel of the protecting groups from tne carboxy moiety of Formula V and when necessary, from the amino moiety by techniques known in the art as discussed hereinbelow. Alternatively, compounds of Formula XI can be prepared from the coupling of N trifluoro acetyl L aspartic acid anhydride XVII with a salt of an amino ketone of Formula XII EMI28.4 With regard to the removal sz prctcct r. groups from compounds of formulae IV and V a number of deprotecting techniques are known in the art and can be utilized to advantage depending on the nature of the protecting groups.Among such techniques is catalytic hydrogenation utilizing palladium on carbon or transfer hydrogenation with 1,4cyclohexadiene. Generally the reaction is carried at room temperature but may be conducted from 5 to 650C. Usually the reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent which may include, but are not limited to water, methanol, ethanol, dioxame, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, t butyl alcohol, isopropanol or mixtures thereof. The reaction is usually run at a positive hydrogen pressure of 50 psi but can be conducted over the range of 20 to 250 psi.Reactions are generally quantitative taking 1 to 24 hours for completion. In any of the previous synthetic methods the desired products are preferably recovered from reaction mixtures by crystallization. Alternatively, normal or reverse phase chromatography may be utilized as well as liquid liquid extraction or other means. The desired compounds of formula I are usually obtained in the free acid form they may also be recovered as their physiologically acceptable salts, i.e., the corresponding amino salts such as hydrochloride,sulfate hydrosulfate, nitrate, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, phosphate or hydrophosphate or the alkali metal salts such as the sodium, potassium, lithium, or the alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium, as well as aluminum, zine and like salts. Conversion of the free petite derivatives of formula I into their physiologically acceptable salts is carried out by conventional means, as for example, bringing the compounds of formula I into ontact with a mineral acid, an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkali metal oxide or carbonate or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, oxide, carbonate or other complexed form. These physiologically acceptable salts can also be utilized as sweetness agents usually having increased solubility and stability over their free forms. It is known to those skilled in the art that the compounds of the present invention having asymmetric carbon atoms may exist in racemic or optically active forms. All of these forms are contemplated within the scope of the invention. The compounds of the present invention have two asymmetric sites, which are designated by an asterik in the formula below, and one pseudo asymmetric site which is designated by a double asterik EMI30.1 Whenever A is identical to A , the compounds of the present invention have only two asymmetric sites, designated by the asterisk in the dicarboxylic acid moiety and the secondary carbinol carbon. Although both the D and L forms are possible the preferred compounds are those in which the dicarboxylic acid group is in the L configuration. Whenever, the groups A and A are different, the carbon atoms designated by the double asterisk become asymetric centers and the compounds of the present invention will contain at least three asymmetric centers. Further asymmetric centers can exist in the group ZY as is recognizable to those skilled in this art. Regardless, the configuration around each of the asymmetric sites, whenever present, may exist in either the D or L forms, and all possible stereoisomers are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.

N Boc 2 amino 2 methyl 4 2,2,5,5 tetra methyl l cycloentyl utene is dissolved in ether to which is added an ether solution of meta chloroper benzoic acid. After the oxidation is complete, as judged by thin layer chromatography, the reaction is diluted with ether arid washed twice with dilute NaHCO3. After drying over MgSO4 the solvent is evaporated to give the crude epoxide. The epoxide is redissolved in dry ether in a flask equipped with a reflux condenser and an argon gas inlet.To this solution is added an equivalent amount cf anhydrous magnesium bromide and the contents of the flask refluxed for 4 hours under argon.The mixture is then cooled, poured over ice and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer is dried over NaSO4 and filtered. The filtrate is evaporated to give two major products which are separated by column chromatography on silica gel to yield N Boc 2 amino 2 methyl 4 2,2,5,5tetramethyl 1 cyclopentyl 3 butanone and Boc 2 a lino 4 oxo 4 2,2,5,5 tetramethyl l cyclopentyl butane. N Boc 2 amino 2 methyl 4 2,2,5,5 tetramethyl 1 cyclopentyl 3 butanone is dissolved in tri luorcacetic acid and the solution is stirred overnight. Water is added and the mixture is made basic with 20 KOH. The mixture is extracted with ether an tne organic layer is uric over Na 2504 and evaporated to yield 2 amino 2 methyl 4 2,2,5,5 tetramethyl 1 cyclopentyl 3 butanone. To a magnetically stirred solution of 2amino 2 methyl 4 2,2,5,5 tetramethyl 1 cyclopentyl 3 butanone in dry dimethylformamide at 0aC. under argon atmosphere is added N Cbz L aspartic acid beta benzyl ester followed by copper II chloride and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. This is stirred for 18 hours, after which the reaction mixture is poured into 0.1 N KCl and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with saturated NaHCO3 and then water, and dried overMgSO4. Evaporation of the solvent yields N N Cbz L Aspartyl beta benzyl ester 2 amino 2 methyl4 2,2,5,5 tetramethyl 1 cyclopentyl 3 butanone.
