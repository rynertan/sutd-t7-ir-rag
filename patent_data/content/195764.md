## Description
The present invention relates to a seam indicator in an electronic sewing machine with several seams which can be sewn after an adjustment of a seam selecting means. It is a problem by an electronic sewing machine with several seams to show them all that can be sewn. The number of seams is so great that the illustrations of them together cover a great surface. Another problem is how to arrange a seam selection device, where one seam at the time can be selected. In prior art a solution is known from a case, where the seams are allotted a number of cassettes, whereby just a limited set of seams is shown simultaneously. In another case the seams are shown on a lid or the like where each seam has a number and the same is selected by setting the number on a numerical input arrangement on the machine. The density of illustrations in an indicating arrangement is restricted by the fact that there must be a certain distance between the illustrations. Without such a distance the illustrations will run into each other and be difficult to survey. A possibility to solve this problem is presented by the present invention. The seam illustrations are performed on an electronic indicating arrangement according to this invention so that several groups of seam indications become visible one by one by means of electric signals. In such an arrangement the seam illustrations can abut each other whereby every second one, for instance, belongs to one group and the others to another group. By means of an operating member the operator can change showing the different groups. In an arrangement of this kind there must also be markers to show a selected seam. The markers can be made of spots which are made visible by electronic means, one for each seam illustration. Also devices making the selected seam illustration deviate in brightness, preferably higher, can be markers. They are controlled by a seam selecting means so designed that a given measure on it brings about a movement of the marker to the next visible seam illustration in a given direction. The means used to achieve these properties are given the name multiplex driving which is an effective mode to decrease the number of driving steps in the indicating arrangement. If it has many segments on a common plate, the number of connections to the arrangement is decreased which may be of the type LCD Liquid Crystal Display or ELD Electroluminiscens display . In these arrangements the wiring is performed on at least one of two parallel glass discs which simultaneously as being wire carriers serve as liquid enclosing surfaces. By a combination of a special wiring and multiplex driving the problem of indicating seams in groups and a moveable marker has been solved by the invention so that one for the sewing machine desired number of seam illustrations more than well is fulfilled. The characterizing properties of the invention are resumed in the characterizing clause of Claim 1. An embodiment of the arrangement according to the invention will be described in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings which show in A display of the indicating arrangement is envisaged in Fig. 1a where eight seam illustrations in the form of the characters A H and marker arrows are visible when all segments 10, 11 in the arrangement are active. Usually, all segments are not active, so a typical illustration on the display can look like Fig. 1b. The display is constituted of a pair of glass discs on which the segments in the shape of transparent foils are applied and separated by a layer of liquid crystal LCD . The foils form the said characters and arrows on the discs according to Fig. 1a. In order to put tension to the segments a wiring pattern is required on the discs. Such a pattern has horizontal H₀, H₁, H₂ as well as vertical V₁, V₂, V₃ wires and the composition of them on the disc with characters and arrows is shown in Fig. 1c, and on the disc with a corresponding foil in Fig. 1d. The appearance of an illustration according to Fig. 1b takes place by supplying pulses in a multiplex system with a multiplier 2 on wires involved, i.e. the segments are divided into two phases which are supplied cyclically one by one. The time of a cycle is short, some 30 ms, so the eye will see the illustration constant. In one of the phases the illustrations of A, B, C, and D are included and in the second phase the markers. The supply to multiplex arranged LCDs is effected by complex alternating waves, and in the following the waves on one disc are denoted H In Fig. 3 the four waves H In practice, a so called multiplexer 12 is used for producing the waves and constituted, as shown by the example in Fig. 4, of a CMOS module number CD 4052. A counter CD 4024 and an oscillator CD 4047 are connected to it. The oscillator produces a control pulse at every 7,5 ms to the counter which prepares and supplies to the multiplexer a number series 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2 etc. cyclically with 7,5 ms between the units. The multiplexer is divided into departments for the waves V₁, V₂, V₃ etc and every department has four inputs 0, 1, 2, 3, some of which having constant tensions U and U, respectively. When the counter addresses on inlets 0 in each department the tension U occasionally connected on these inlets passes to the respective outlet V₁, V₂, V₃ etc. By stepping on to 1 the tension occasionally connected to inlets 1 passes to the outlets. A cycle 30 ms thus includes addressing on all inlets 0, 1, 2, 3, one by one. Then the counter repeats the number series during the following cycles, whereby the waves thus shown in Fig. 3 are produced in an infinite succession. The tensions U and U can by means of change over switches 13 be moved to other inlets than the ones shown. Hereby other waves arise resulting in appearance of another illustration than the one shown in Fig. 1b. By change over switching it is thus possible to indicate all the eight characters A H by the marker. What the wiring diagram of such change over switches can look like is shown in Fig. 5. The example shows producing of U and U on the respective outlets according to Fig. 4. A twelve bits memory 14 has been programmed in columns and the one giving the illustrations in Fig. 1b is shown. Outlets having common inlets to a switch module 16 are gathered on gates 15 and the tensions U and U are distributed with respect to the inlets so that 1 on the inlet means closing of the respective switch and 0 means breaking. A set of resistors 17 on the outlets to earth makes stability to the tensions which then are passed directly to the multiplexer Fig. 4 . Fig. 1b shows one of the illustrations the arrangement can display. By addressing the waves to other wires the illustration can thus be varied. The arrangement is a simple example of showing a few seams and a marker on a display the number can, of course, be multiplied by means of a corresponding number of segments and a wiring pattern belonging thereto. Possibly can, for instance, 100 seams be illustrated on the display distributed as 10 x 10. Analogously to the foregoing example the number of supply wires will be H₀, H₁, H₂, ...H₁₀ V₁, V₂...V₁₀ 21. As a further development of the system more phases can be added and thus further segments be supplied, e. g. for showing stitch length and bight. Then the multiplex multiplier increases with 1 for every further phase. In certain types of displays it is possible to displace the whole illustration stepwise in a horizontal or vertical direction. By such advanced indicating arrangements it is possible to envisage another group of seam illustrations constituting the previously shown group displaced a step horizontally and presenting further seam illustrations utmost on the display. A corresponding number of seam illustrations vanishes simultaneously at the opposite side of the display. Such a feeding of further illustrations is generally called scrolling and may be achieved by a network of modules according to Fig. 6. Two manually operated switches 18, 19 are connected to a decade counter 20 for a marker with the module number MM 74 C 192 which on a signal from the switch 18 counts up a step and on a signal from the switch 19 down a step . The switches are provided with arrows so that the operator sees in what direction the marker will move when the switch is actuated. The counter has a connection with a decoder 21 with the number MM 74 C 42 with ten outlets 22 which supply marker lamps or the like, and with a decade counter 23 for the seam illustrations, which counter is also connected to a decoder 24. The outlets 25 of it supplies tension to a segment of illustration or the like, which shows, e.g., illustrations with the numbers 1 10. When the counter 20 has stepped from 1 10 and thus moved the marker across the whole display, another actuation of the switch 18 has the effect that a signal is output on a connection wire 26 to the counter 23 which then counts up so that the illustrations with the numbers 2 11 become visible. An actuation of the switch 19 then gives a signal on a connecting wire 27 which makes the counter 23 count down and restore the illustrations number 1 10. Thus, the switches bring about counting both up and down on both sides of 10 with a presentation of further seam illustrations as far as the illustration series is extending.
