# Sealing cap for use in internal cleaning of can fillers.

## Abstract
There is described a sealing cap for use in sealing the can filling head of can filling apparatus to allow cleaning fluid to be pumped through the head. The sealing cap closes off the head in substitution for a can and comprises a sealing member rotatably mounted within a threaded retaining ring adapted to be screwed onto a threaded outer surface of the can filling head. This configuration allows easy fitment of the sealing cap during head cleaning operations.
