# Skip seal mechanism for packaging machine.

## Abstract
A skip seal mechanism for packaging machine in which articles are heat sealed between two continuous webs of plastic material comprises two parallel synchronously driven shafts 17, 20 , each of which has a pair of wheels 15, 16, 18, 19 on it which are brought into pressure relationship for heat sealing. One shaft 17 is mounted for yielding perpendicularly to its rotational axis and carries a cam follower disc 40, 41 . The follower disc is raised intermittently and the seal wheels 15, 16, 18, 19 are thereby separated, to relieve pressure and omit sealing, with a cam 44, 45 that is on the other shaft and is engaged periodically for rotation by means of a clutch 47 .
