# A METHOD AND MEANS FOR REDUCING SIGNAL PROPAGATION LOSSES IN VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A method and means for reducing signal propagation losses in very large scale integrated circuits is provided comprising a ground plane located adjacent to, but in sulated from, a conductive signal layer overlying an active region in a semiconductor substrate. While, the ground plane is preferrably disposed between the signal layer and the substrate, it may be disposed above the signal layer. Moreover, two or more signal layers may be employed and sandwiched between a pair of ground planes.
