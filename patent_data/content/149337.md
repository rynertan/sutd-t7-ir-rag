# X RAY GENERATING APPARATUS AND METHOD OF OPERATING AN X RAY TUBE

## Abstract
An X ray generating apparatus with a filament energiz ing transformer 120, 121 184 mounted inside the X ray tube housing 11 while a high voltage generating transformer 112 remains outside that housing 11 . This arrangement allows a single high magnitude negative polarity input 114 to be routed through the tube housing 11 and coupled to the tube cathode 24 . In one embodiment of the invention two cathode filaments 54, 56 are each energized when in use by an associated one of two filament transformers 120, 121 inside the housing 11 . Selective energization of one or the other transformers determines which filament is to be energized. In an alternate embodiment a frequency sensing electronic switch 188 chooses which filament 54, 56 to energize depending on the energization frequency input to a single filament transformer 184 . A method of operating an X ray tube is also provided.
