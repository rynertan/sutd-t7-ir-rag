# Method and apparatus for forming laminated sheet glass.

## Abstract
A first molten glass C of one composition is supplied to a first overflow channel 24 and a second molten glass S of another composition is supplied to a second overflow channel 14 . The first glass C is overflowed from the first channel 24 into two separate downwardly converging sheet like flow paths. The second glass S is overflowed from the second channel 14 downwardly into two separate sheet like flow paths and on to the outer surface of the downwardly flowing sheet like paths of the first glass to form a pair of downwardly converging laminated flows while said glasses are in a molten condition. The converging pairs of laminated flows are united into a single composite 42 and a sheet of laminated glass is drawn therefrom. The outer surface of the second glass is maintained free from contact with distirbuting or forming means so as to provide a laminated glass sheet 42 of fire polished quality.
