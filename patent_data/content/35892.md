# FLUID FLOW CONTROL

## Abstract
One or more manually operable proximity switches 34, 35 control electrically valve means 30, 33 consisting of either a variable flow valve which is also a shut off valve, or a variable flow valve 30 and a separate shut off valve 33 , in a water supply line. The valve means 30, 33 can be a water tap or in a water input line of a water heater. Two proximity switches 34, 35 can be provided, one 34 to increase and the other 35 to decrease the throughflow cross section of the valve means 30, 33 . The time period for which each switch 34, 35 is operated determines the degree of change of the cross section.
