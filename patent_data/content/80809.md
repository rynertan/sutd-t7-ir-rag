# A method of making wrought high tension steel having superior low temperature toughness.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the manufacture of steel having high strength, toughness and weldability, in the as rolled condition with a structure of bainite or bainite and ferrite. The steel is heated within a range of 1000 C, rolled with a reduction amount of not less than 60 at a temperature of not more than 900 C, the rolling finishing temperature is within 640 850 C, and then the steel is cooled to lower than 550 C with a cooling rate of 15 40 C sec. The steel contains in wt. C 0,005 0,12 Si not more than 0,6 Mn 0,6 2,2 S not more than 0,005 AL 0,005 0,08 Nb 0,01 0,08 B 0,0005 0,002 Ti 0,004 0,03 N not more than 0,007 Fe Balance and satisfying the expression 0,01 Ti 3,4 N 0,002 optionally the steel may contain at least one element from the group V, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mo, Ca and rare earth metals.
