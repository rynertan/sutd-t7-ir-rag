## Description
This invention relates to fungicidal aniline derivatives. Benzimidazole and thiophanate fungicides such as Benomyl methyl 1 butylcarbamoyl benzimidazol 2 ylcarbamate , Fubelidazol 2 2 furyl benzimidazole , Thiabendazole 2 4 thiazolyl benzimidazole , Carbendazim methyl benzimidazol 2 ylcarbamate , Thiophanate methyl 1,2 bis 3 methoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene , Thiophanate 1,2 bis 3 ethoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene , 2 O,S dimethylphosphorylamino 1 3 methoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene and 2 O,O dimethylthiophosphorylamino 1 3 methoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene are known to show an excellent fungicidal activity against various plant pathogenic fungi, and they have been widely used as agricultural fungicides since 1970. However, their continuous application over a long period of time results in phytopathogenic fungi which possess a tolerance to them, whereby their ability to prevent plant disease is significantly lowered. Furthermore, the fungi which acquire a tolerance to certain benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicides also show a considerable tolerance to some other benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicides. Thus, they are apt to obtain a cross tolerance. Therefore, if any significant decrease of their ability to prevent plant disease in certain fields is observed, their use in such fields has to be discontinued. However, it is often observed that the density of drug resistant organisms does not decrease even long after the discontinuation of the application. Although other fungicides have to be employed in these cases, only a few are as effective as benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicides in controlling various phytopathogenic fungi. Cyclic imide fungicides such as Procymidone 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 1,2 dimethylcyclopropane 1,2 dicarboximide , Iprodione 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 1 isopropylcarbamoylimidazolidine 2,4 dione , Vinchlozolin 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 5 methyl 5 vinyloxazolidine 2,4 dione , ethyl RS 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 5 methyl 2,4 dioxooxazolidine 5 carboxylate, etc., which are effective against various plant diseases, particularly those caused by In C.R. Acad. Sc. Paris, t. 289, S erie D, pages 691 693 1979 , herbicides such as Barban 4 chloro 2 butynyl N 3 chlorophenyl carbamate , Chlorobufam 1 methyl 2 propynyl N 3 chlorophenyl carbamate , Chloropropham isopropyl N 3 chlorophenyl carbamate and Propham isopropyl N phenylcarbamate are disclosed as exhibiting a fungicidal activity against certain organisms tolerant to some benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicides. However, their fungicidal activity against drug resistant fungi is not strong enough, and hence, in practice they cannot be used as fungicides. We have now found that aniline derivatives of the formula By the term lower as used herein in connection with alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylene or alkoxy groups is meant that those groups had not more than 6 carbon atoms.
