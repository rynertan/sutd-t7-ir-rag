# Wrapping device using heat sealable film.

## Abstract
In a wrapping device for wrapping articles in heat sealable plastic film, a web of film is drawn from a supply roll not shown and is severed by pulling the film under tension downwardly onto the narrow edge of a thermal cut off device 20 , which may be a heated rod 21 or blade 121 , to melt the film material along a thin transverse line and to permit severance thereof by pulling. Following severance of the film, the film wrapped package is sealed by placing the package on a pedestal hot plate 11 . The temperature of the hot plate 11 is higher than that of the thermal cut off device 20 used to sever the film and the thermal cut off device 20 obtains its heat by conduction from the hot plate 11 .
