## Description
The present invention relates to a language forming system which modifies expressions in a basic form e.g., words, i.e., nouns, verbs, and the like, or noun or adjective phrases to form corresponding language expressions in a different form. In a machine translation system, when an input sentence is translated into a sentence in another language, the translated sentence is sometimes inappropriate. For example, in a conventional sentence structure transfer method, when an operator judges that a translated sentence displayed on a display screen is inappropriate, he cancels the displayed translated sentence, and must restart the translating process, including sentence structure transfer in accordance with language data stored in a language data base, to obtain another translated output. This sentence structure transfer method is described in the text used during the Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Tokyo, September 30 October 4, 1980, on p. 414 and thereafter. When a large number of translation alternatives are output as described above, if a satisfactorily translated sentence cannot be obtained, the content of the language data base must be renewed, and the whole process must be repeated to form an appropriately translated sentence. However, this method applies considerable load to the operator. In addition, all the modifications of language expressions must be stored in the language data base, resulting in a bulky and impractical system. Examples of such systems can be found in an article in Information Processing 1977 by Dell Orco et al pages 139 143, another article in Communications of the ACM, Vol 25 1982 pages 27 47 and also in Japanese patent application no. 58 217 081. However, none of these systems enable a user to easily, quickly and efficiently modify the language expressions stored in the language data base. It is an object of the present invention to provide a language forming system with high practical advantages, which effectively uses a data base for forming a given language expression, can easily obtain a language expression in a desired form, and can greatly simplify an operation for obtaining an appropriate language expression. According to the present invention, there is provided a language forming system comprising The language expression data base stores common expression data for an entire sentence to be formed, input expression data set to correspond to a partial expression of an input sentence, expression modification formation rule data, and the like. When a basic form of a certain language expression is input, attribute data stored in the language expression data base is selected accordingly, and the language expression in the basic form is modified in accordance with the attribute data. In this way, the language expression data base stores attribute data for various expressions. When a certain expression is input in its basic form, a modified expression can be formed in accordance with the attribute data stored in the data base. When a processing unit is a sentence, an output character string need not be modified by deletion or insertion, and a language expression which is modified to a desired expression can be easily obtained. When the attribute data stored in the data base is changed, expressions for all output sentences can be corrected systematically, and load on an operator can be greatly reduced. This invention can be more fuly understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which An embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter, with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a sentence structure transfer type machine translation system to which the present invention is applied. A case will be exemplified wherein Japanese sentences are translated into English sentences. Referring to Fig. 1, input Japanese sentence data is supplied to Japanese analysis unit 10, which extracts Japanese sentence structure data and various Japanese expression data. Japanese sentence analysis is performed with reference to Japanese analysis dictionary 11. Assume that an input Japanese sentence is as shown in Fig. 3A. An appropriate translated sentence thereof is I took him. . This sentence can be re written in Roman characters as Watashi wa kare wo tsurete yukimashita. . The Japanese expression data extracted by unit 10 is data representing an inherent expression in each sentence, such as whether the input sentence is in the past, present, or future tense, or the like, and whether it is in an interrogative form, a negative form, or the like, and the resultant data is stored in language expression data base 12 through language expression data memory 10a. Data base 12 also stores data representing an expression common to a plurality of sentences e.g., polite expression data . As is well known, a Japanese sentense often includes a polite expression e.g., ...desu. , ...masu. , or the like , which is added to the end of a sentence. Generally speaking, data stored in data base 12 includes Unit 10 also extracts Japanese sentence structure data, which is then supplied to sentence structure transfer unit 14 through buffer memory 13 used if necessary . Unit 14 forms English sentence structure data corresponding to the input Japanese sentence structure data with reference to bilingual dictionary 15. The obtained English sentence structure data is supplied to English synthesis circuit 17 through buffer memory 16 used if necessary . Circuit 17 reads out the content of synthesis dictionary 18 on the basis of the input English sentence structure data to obtain English sentence data in a basic form, which has a word order and sentence structure equivalent to that of the input Japanese sentence. The English sentence data in the basic form is then supplied to one input terminal of basic form input unit 22 through language data base 19. Unit 22 is also coupled to the outputs from language data input unit 20 and data selector 21, both of which have keyboards. The output from unit 22 is, for example, a series of contents of a sentence I carry him. , which is supplied to expression modification unit 23. Expression data stored in data base 12 is read out and supplied to expression modification unit 23. Note that since the input Japanese sentence is in the past tense and in the affirmative form, data base 12 stores past tense data and affirmative form data as language expression data. Therefore, the basic sentence I carry him. from unit 22 is modified based on the past and affirmative expression data from the data base 12, obtaining a modified English sentence I carried him. . Note that polite English expressions include ...would like to... and the like. The operator inputs this kind of expression data from expression data input unit 24 to data base 12. The basic English sentence I carry him. can also be input by the operator through unit 20, instead of being obtained as the output from the sentence structure transfer type machine translation system. The detailed structure and function of this system are described in the text of above mentioned Conference. Fig. 2 shows the main part of the system in Fig. 1, in more detail. The same reference numerals in Fig. 2 denote the same parts as in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 2, unit 20 is used for manually inputting English basic form data through a keyboard or the like. Data selector 21 selects basic form data stored in language data base 19 in advance. Units 20 and 21 are controlled by input controller 22a. English basic form data is supplied from unit 22 to expression modification unit 23. Unit 23 mainly comprises synthesis control unit 23a, and refers to expression referring unit 23b so as to extract attribute data stored in data base 12. The extracted attribute data is supplied to modification control unit 23c, to modify corresponding expressions in the basic form data. Data base 12 includes expression input control unit 12a. Data from unit 24 with a keyboard and language expression data from unit 10 are input to data base 12 through expression input data memory 10a and control unit 12a. The modified English sentence data output from unit 23 is supplied to expression output unit 30. Unit 30 has output control unit 30a, which supplies output data to display 31 or data file 32. The operation of the system according to the embodiment in Figs. 1 and 2 will be described in detail with reference to Figs. 3A to 3F, 4, and 5. Input Japanese sentence data shown in Fig. 3A corresponding to an English sentence I took him. is supplied to unit 10 in Fig. 1. Unit 10 extracts the past tense and affirmative expression data from the input data, and stores it in data base 12. Unit 10 also extracts Japanese sentence structure data shown in Fig. 3B, and supplies it from memory 13 to transfer unit 14. Unit 14 transfers the Japanese sentence structure data in Fig. 3B to the sentence structure data shown in Fig. 3C, with reference to bilingual dictionary 15. Note that Fig. 3C shows an English sentence for easy understanding. However, actual data simply indicates a sentence structure. The output from unit 14 is stored in memory 16. First translated sentence data is then displayed on display 31, as shown, in Fig. 3D, through units 17, 19, 22, and 23, in accordance with the sentence structure data stored in memory 16. The displayed, translated sentence data is then checked by the operator. If the operator judges that a part of the sentence in Fig. 3D e.g., the verb carried is inappropriate, he moves cursor 35 to a position under the word carried and instructs correction of this word using, e.g., a function key on the keyboard of data selector 21. As a result, the input and output sentences are displayed on display 31 while cursors 35 and 36 are displayed to a position under their corresponding portions, as shown in Fig. 3D. When the function key of selector 21 is depressed, translation candidates corresponding to the Japanese verb indicated by cursor 36 are read out from data base 19 under the control of unit 22a, and are displayed in their infinitive form, as shown in Fig. 3E. The operator selects the verb take from the displayed candidates, and indicates it with cursor 37. The selected verb take is then supplied to unit 22, and the basic form sentence I carry him. is modified to a new basic form sentence I take him. The modified basic sentence is supplied to unit 23, and is modified based on the past tense and affirmative expression data stored in data base 12, thus forming the output sentence shown in Fig. 3F. In the above descriptions, past tense and affirmative positive form data are extracted as expression data and stored in data base 12 following analysis of the input Japanese sentence. Next, respective words or phrases of the basic form sentence are modified based on the expression data. If an interrogative is input in the present tense, for example, expression data stored in data base 12 is updated or renewed as present tense and interrogative form data. In addition, an expression ...would like to... can be stored in data base 12 through input unit 24, and can be used for sentence modification by unit 23, thus obtaining a sentence, I would like to take him. Fig. 4 is a flow chart showing the operation of unit 23 in Fig. 2. First, an expression data is read out from data base 12 in step S1. The flow advances to step 52 for checking if a modification command is input. If step S2 generates a YES, the read out expression data is modified in step S3. If step S2 generates a NO the flow advances to step S4 where a first sentence element in the sentence data stored in basic form input unit 22 is obtained. This sentence element is supplied to expression modification unit 23 to make or read out a modified element based on the expression data read from unit 12 in step S5. The flow advances to step S6 for checking if any element remains. If step S6 generates a YES, the flow advances to step S7 where a next sentence element is obtained which is then modified in step S5. If step S6 generates a NO, the flow advances to step S8 where all the modified sentence elements are synthesized to form a modified complete sentence. The above operation is performed for all the sentence elements to be modified in accordance with the word order determined by English synthesis unit 17. In this case, only the operation for modifying the word carry to carried is performed. As previously described, since the operator inputs an instruction to replace the word carry with take , a YES is generated in step S2, and the flow advances to step S3. The word take is read out from data base 19 under the control of selector 21, and the word took is obtained through steps S4 to S5 in the manner as described above. The sentence elements including the modified word took are synthesized in step S8, thus obtaining the output sentence shown in Fig. 3F. According to the present invention as described above, elements of an input basic sentence can be modified in accordance with expression data stored in an expression data base to easily obtain an output translated sentence with a desired expression, without storing language data for all expression forms in a language data base. Since expression data includes expressions common to some sentences, the expression data base can be simplified, and data stored therein can be used effectively. In the above embodiment, an output sentence with a desired expression is obtained using basic form and expression data obtained in the sentence structure transfer type machine translation system. The basic form data supplied to unit 23 can also be obtained from other machine translation systems e.g., a PIVOT type system . For example, an input sentence to be translated is supplied to unit 23 as basic form data, to obtain a modified sentence in accordance with expression data stored in data base 12. Alternatively, after the verb take in a sentence input from unit 20, for example, is replaced with get , the modified sentence can be input to unit 23 as a basic form sentence. An input expression is not limited to sentences, but can be words, phrases, or clauses. In the above embodiment, a dictionary form or the infinitive form is used as a basic form, but the present tense, for example, can be used thereas. Fig. 5 is a chart showing the operation of the embodiment of the present invention when a sentence I didn t take him. is translated into a corresponding Japanese sentence in a manner opposite to the above embodiment. Referring to Fig. 5, the portion surrounded by solid lines shows a process for modifying basic form language with expression data. Information, outside the solid line block shows that translated sentences having various meanings can be obtained through expression modification processing.
