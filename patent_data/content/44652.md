# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BLENDING A FLUID

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for blending a material contain ing two distinct phases of different densities flowing along a pipe, so that the two phases tend to form accumulations at different levels in horizontal portions of the pipe, the method comprising injecting a fluid into the pipe under pressure, characterised in that the fluid is injected into the pipe 10 with components of motion both radial and tangential to an adjacent portion of the pipe wall, in such a way that it causes both dispersion of the accumulations 11, 12 and rotation of the material around the circumference of the pipe. The invention is particularly applicable in the oil industry.
