# PROGRAMMABLE SEMICONDUCTOR STRUCTURES AND METHOD FOR USING THE SAME

## Abstract
An integrated circuit array 30, 70, 110, 170 of the type having several programmable cells and first and second sets of address lines 34,38 38,82 82,112 112,114 114,116 116,118 features programmable cells 10,20,54,160,172 having up to four possible electrical impedance states or conditions which are made possible by a plurality of rectifying semiconductor junctions 12,14 50,52 arranged in series in each cell. The four conditions are a first in which the impedance is high in both directions a second in which the impedance is high in one direction and low in the opposite direction a third in which the impedance is high in the opposite direction and low in the first direction and a fourth in which the impedance is low in both directions. The array may be made with semiconduc tor layers 40,42,44,45,46,48 166,168 which form series ocoupled back to back diodes 12,14 50,52 , each diode in each cell being selectively programmable to lose its rectify ing feature. The rectifying junctions may be formed from Schottky diodes. Alternate embodiments include pluralities 36,36 of layers of such programmable cells in two or more separately programmable planes, wherein each plane may have its own addressing means. Also disclosed is an integrated circuit formed as a multilayered structure 30,70,110 of deposited layers of various materials 34 to 38 , including semiconductor alloy materials 40,42,44,45,46,48 . The layers of semiconductor alloys are initially deposited as continuous layers. The layers are arranged to provide semiconductor interactions between at least some of the layers at several unique locations 54 within the structure, and to provide the programmable interactions in two separate subsets 36,36 120,122 , each separately programmable from the other. The integrated circuit includes addressing means 34,38,82,112,114,116, 118 . Programmable logic arrays can be formed out of such multilayered structures, and may include AND and OR planes 92,94 , which are vertically disposed one on top of the other.
