# Detergent composition containing low level of substituted polyamines.

## Abstract
Detergent compositions containing low levels of sub stituted polyamines are disclosed. The polyamines are substituted by one long chain alkyl or alkenyl group and by at least two alkylene oxide radicals attached to dif ferent nitrogens. Preferred compositions produce a laun dry liquor pH in the range from 8.5 12.0 and frequently contain water soluble or water insoluble detergent buil ders. These compositions exhibit a broad range of textile treatment benefits particularly enhanced soil release and cleaning properties.
