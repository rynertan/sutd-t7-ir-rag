## Description
Sanitary towel, throw away napkin or similar object, with improved sanitary proPerties . This invention relates to a sanitary towel, a throw away napkin, or a similar object with improved sanitary properties. The object of the invention is to provide a sanitary towel which is so structured that after being used andn fo ed condition and as it were packed, it may be thrown away. For this purpose, the sanitary towel according to the invention is comprised of a strip absorbing material with edges projecting at least sidewise along the lengthwise direction of said strip, which are self adhesive on the one side, all this in such a way that after being used, the towel may be folded in the middle and along the cross wise direction, while the self adhesive edges after being folded over 18f outwards, may be pressed together whereby the towel may be thrown away in folded condition. According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, said self adhesive projecting edges are part of a sheet impermeable material which is joined to said absorbing material strip. Advantageously, projecting one sided self adhesive edges are also provided along both crosswise ends of said absorbing material strip. Other details and advantages of the invention will stand out from the following description, given by way of non limitative example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective showing of a sanitary towel according to the invention, as seen from the back. Figure 2 is a perspective showing of a sanitary towel as shown in figure 1, in the condition wherein it may be folded after being used. Figure 3 is a showing of the sanitary towel in a further folding position. The sanitary towel according to these figures is comprised in an embodiment which is to be preferred, but which is only described by way of example, of a strip I from absorbing material and a sheet 2 connected thereto from impermeable material.The connection between the strip 1 and the sheet 2 is obtained by using some method which makes it possible to bind cellulose like materials to a sheet 2 for example from polymer material. One such method lies simply in glueing the strip 1 to the sheet 2. This sheet 2 has as well along the lengthwise direction as along the cross wise direction, self adhesive edges which after being folded over 1800 outwards, may be considered as projecting edges.To make the description clear, the self adhesive edges which appear as projecting edges on either side of the strip 1 are indicated with the references 3 3 and 4 4 . The self adhesive edges which lie at both ends of the strip 1, that is the self adhesive projecting edges after folding over 1800 outwards and which lie in the cross wise direction, are indicated with the references 5 5 . These edges are provided over the whole surface thereof or locally with an adhesive material.Between the edges 3 3 and 4 4 may occur a cut in to enhance folding. Adhesive spots 9 connect temporarily and locally said edges with the sheet 2 said edges are folded back on. Figure 1 which shows the towel as it is supplied and before being used, shows this clearly. The edges 5 5 which are folded inwards, retain the edges 3 3 and 4 4 in the inward folded condition as shown in figure 1, suitably in position. Over the sheet 2 as well as over the folded edges 3 3 , 4 4 and 5 5 is provided a silicone paper sheet lo which is first removed when using the sanitary tows,l. In figure 1, said silicone paper sheet has been partly drawn, so that this figure pertains both to the sanitary towel as it is supplied, that is with the silicone paper sheet, as to the condition wherein it is being used after emoving said silicone paper sheet. Figure 1 thus shows the back side of the sanitary towel as opposed to figures 2 and 3 which show the sanitary towel as reversed relative to figure 1, with the absorbing material strip visible on the top side. In the condition of use, the selfadhesive edges 3 3 , 4 4 and 5 5 thus lie on the other side relative to the absorbing material strip 1. The self adhesive edges thus adhere well to fabrics and retain the towel in position, as it is used. After being used, the self adhesive edges are very easily brought to the position wherein they are shown in figures 2 and 3. The self adhesive edges 3 and 4 are easily released from the sheet 2 in the location of the adhesive spots 9 to then become projecting edges. When folding over the cross wise edges 5 5 , the edges 3 3 and 4 4 are also released so that these self adhesive edges then take the position or shown in figures 2 and 3. The towel is then folded in the direction as shown by arrows 7 along the fold line 8, level with the two incisions 6. When the sanitary towel is completely folded, that is when the self adhesive projecting edges 3 and 3 on the one side, and 4 and 4 on the other side, as well as the projecting cross edges 5 and 5 are in contact with one another, the sanitary towel lies as completely nwrapped n, The absorbing strip 1 lies then completely enclosed in the impermeable sheet 2, so that the throwing away of the towel does not raise any problem. Even when the above description refers completely to a sanitary towel, thennvention is naturally also to be applied for throw away baby napkins and similar objects. It is further clear that the invention is not limited to the above described embodiment and that many changes may be brought therein, notably as regards the shape, composition and arrangement of the elements which are essential to embodying the invention.
