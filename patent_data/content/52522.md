# AN ENHANCED SURFACE TUBE

## Abstract
An enhanced surface tube is made up of at least two conduits with the inner conduit 2 being stainless steel and with a spiral groove 4 extending in from the outer surface of the twin wall tube and forming a radially inwardly extending spiral protuberance 5 on the inner surface of the stainless steel conduit thus interconnecting the two conduits so that in use they will act as a single enhanced surface tube.
