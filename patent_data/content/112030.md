# Rotatable fasteners.

## Abstract
A fastener having an axis 13 about which it is rotated in order to operate, and comprising a driving end portion 11 formed with an opening adapted to accept the tip 12 of a tool for rotating the fastener about its axis, the opening including a mouth 20 shaped for driving engagement with the tool tip and an enlarged region 28 below the mouth to accommodate movement of the extremity of the tool tip relative to the fastener when the tool is used at an angle to the fastener axis, wherein the enlarged region 28 is provided by a recess 22 in the driving end portion 11 of the fastener which extends to, and is open at, the periphery 26 of the driving end portion. The provision of the enlarged region by means of a laterally extending recess enables the fastener to be manufactured simply and economically by moulding or casting. A further aspect of the invention is the manner of mouldng or casting the fastener.

## Description
ROTATABLE FASTENERS This invention concerns improvements in or relating to fasteners which have an axis about which they are rotated in order to operate, such as threaded fasteners. It is known to use a tool having a flexible or articulated shaft to rotate a threaded fastener about an axis which is offset and or inclined to an axis about which the handle of the tool is rotated. Such tools are useful for driving fasteners in inaccessible locations, but are expensive to manufacture. In order to reduce the need to use such tools, it has been proposed to modify the design of the heads of certain socket head fasteners to permit the fasteners to be driven by an ordinary rigid shaft tool whilst the shaft axis is inclined slightly to the rotational axis of the fastener. However, the proposals involve an extra forming step in the process for manufacturing the fasteners, which extra step gives rise to serious additional labour and tooling costs, greatly increases the risks of production tolerances accumulating to increase the scrap or reject rates, and may introduce weaknesses into the head socket. Furthermore, the scope of the proposal is very restricted, and the proposal in turn restricts the design of the socket heads. A screw design having a modified head for the above purpose is disclosed in Austrian Patent No.366156 but that design is undesirably expensive to produce. The invention provides a rotatable fastener which is relatively inexpensive to produce and which can accept a considerable angular mis alignment between the tool axis and the fastener axis. According to the present invention there is provided a fastener having an axis about which it is rotated in order to operate, and comprising a driving end portion formed with an opening adapted to accept the tip of a tool for rotating the fastener about its axis, the opening including a mouth shaped for driving engagement with the tool tip and an enlarged region below the mouth to accommodate movement of the extremity of the tool tip relative to the fastener when the tool is used at an angle to the fastener axis, wherein the enlarged region is provided by a recess in the driving end portion of the fastener which extends to, and is open at, the periphery of the driving end portion. The fastener can be made in a one step casting or moulding operation which is characterised, in accordance with the invention, by moulding or casting suitable material in a cavity defined in the shape of the fastener, including the recess, by mould parts which include a male recess forming portion which extends laterally into the cavity, and releasing the fastener from the cavity by separating the mould parts. The mould parts may include two main mould parts which separate on a plane which includes the fastener axis, one of said main mould parts including said male portion, which extends in the direction of separation of that mould part, and a further male mould part shaped to form said mouth and movable axially of the cavity up to and away from said male portion. In the fastener of the invention the width and thickness of the recess may be determined independently of the shape, size and thickness of the mouth, so that each may be designed for optimum utility, and may be precisely and accurately made to give a reliable lowcost fastener which will accept relatively large angular misalignment between the fastener and tool axes. The invention is preferably applied to fasteners adapted to be driven by tools having tapered fluted tips, e.g. of Pozidriv or Philips type. The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying dfagram matic drawings, wherein FIGURES 1 and 2 show a fastener of the invention in side elevation and plan, respectively and FIGURE 3 shows a cross section through the fastener on the line III III of FIGURE 2. The fastener comprises an externally threaded shank 10, of known form, and a driving end portion in the form of a head 11 at one end of the shank 10. The head 11 has an opening to receive a fluted tip 12 of a tool for rotating the fastener about a fastener axis 13 co axial with the shank 10. The tip 12 is of a tapered form having four ribs 14. The opening comprises a mouth 20 which extends axially into the head from an end portion 21 of the surface of the head and a recess 22 adjoining the mouth and formed in the head. The mouth 20 is of socket type, centred on the axis 13, and provides wall 23 shaped to provide abutments 24, which project towards the axis, and grooves 25 which project towards a periphery 26 of the head. The recess 22 extends transversely of the head from an entry 27 at the periphery 26, so as to be perpendicular to said axis 13 and disposed between the mouth 20 and the shank 10. The recess 20 is wider than the mouth 20 so as to provide a large undercut 28 beneath the wall 23, and the recess 20 provides a flat bearing surface 29 which confronts the mouth 20. In use, the tip 12 can be inserted into the mouth 20 so that the axis 30 of the tool is aligned with the axis 13 or is at an angle of up to about 300 to 500 to the axis 13 depending to some extent on the taper and shape of the tip 12 to cause the ribs 14 to enter the grooves 25 and engage the abutments 24 in a manner which is effective for permitting the fastener to be rotated about its axis 23 by rotating the tool about the tool axis 30. The undercut or enlarged region 28 permits the end of the tip to move in a circular path below the mouth so that large angular mis alignments of over 200 to 250 between said axes 13 and 30 can be accepted, as indicated in FIGURE 3. Some tips may extend completely across the recess 22 from the mouth to the surface 29 so as to abut the latter.However, the smooth nature of the surface 29 permits the end of the tip to move freely in a circular path against the surface, without causing the tip to jerk or stick. The fastener may be made conveniently in a one step casting or moulding operation using dies or moulds which are separable and serve to define a mould cavity or cavities, the or each of which cavities are formed in known manner to allow the fastener to be removed easily when the dies or moulds are separated. For making the fastener described herein, the dies or moulds are adapted to meet in a plane which includes the axis 13, and one of the dies or moulds is provided with a fixed male part which projects into the mould cavity terpendicular to said plane, for forming the recess 22. A retractable male part is mounted on one of the dies or moulds so as to be movable along said axis 13 to project into said cavity, from one end of the latter, so as to abut the fixed male part for forming the mouth. The invention is not confined to the precise details of the foregoing example and many variations and modifications are possible within the scope of the invention. For example, the fastener may be made from any suitable metal plastics or other material which can be moulded or cast. The shape and form of the fasteners may be varied as desired, e.g. to the extent that the head and shank have a common diameter and thread to provide a stud form of fastener in which the head is vestigial and denoted merely by the presence of the socket. The shape of the driving opening, especially the mouth, may be varied to accept other forms of tool having fluted, ribbed or other types of tips of tapered or untapered form. For example, whilst the wall of the mouth is parallel to the fastener axis in any plane including said axis in the embodiment described, said wall may be inclined to said axis if required. Furthermore, the axial depth of the mouth is slightly less than the axial depth of the recess in said embodiment but may be greater, the same as, or very much less than the axial depth of the recess. The undercut may have rounded sides and may terminate below the peripheral ends of said grooves, but preferably extends radially outwards beyond said grooves.
