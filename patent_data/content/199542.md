# Multiple scanning type television receivers.

## Abstract
In a multiple scanning type television receiver in which a horizontal frequency of a horizontal deflection circuit 13 and a capacitance value of an S shaping capacitor 44 are both switched by an output signal from a frequency to voltage converter 31 which detects a horizontal frequency of an input signal and converts the frequency to a voltage changing in response to the frequency, the horizontal deflection circuit 13 comprises a detector 55 for detecting the switching time point, and during a transient period obtained from said detector 55 the power source 39 of the horizontal deflection circuit 13 is cut off.
