# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ROLLING FLANGED SECTION.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for rolling a section in which flanges are provided connected continuously to a web. Rolls 15,15 ,16,16 for expanding the web in the widthwise direc tion are provided between any steps during the process of rough rolling, intermediate rolling and final rolling. The rolls 15,15 ,16,16 are in contact with the inner sides 21,22 of the flanges. If required, the rolls 15,15 ,16,16 may each engage with the corresponding upper and lower surfaces of the web. The shaft of each of the rolls 15,15 ,16,16 is inclined at a predetermined angle ϑH with respect to the horizontal direc tion, perpendicular to the rolling direction. The shafts of the rolls 15,15 ,16,16 are preferably inclined upward or down ward at a predetermined angle ϑv with respect to the horizon tal plane.
