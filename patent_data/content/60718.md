# Continuous process for the production of methyl formate by the chromium catalysed liquid phase oxidation of methanol.

## Abstract
Methyl formate is produced continuously by reacting methanol in the liquid phase with molecular oxygen in the presence as catalyst of a soluble chromium compound which can be deliberately added or can result from chromium containing metal alloy. Initiation of the oxidation can be accomplished by feeding a material more suscepti ble to oxidation than methanol, either with or without methanol, and optionally in the presence of a soluble chromium compound.
