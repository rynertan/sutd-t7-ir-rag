# Carbonaceous solids cleaning process.

## Abstract
A fraction, for example a 75 to 10 mm fraction, of carbonaceous solids having components of differing densities, such as coal, is physically cleaned by gravimetric separation in a washing tank 12 containing washing medium of s.g. 1.5 to 1.9. The resultant low density fraction, which contains relatively small amounts of inorganic materials, is passed to a second gravimetric separation stage 18 containing washing medium of s.g. 1.3 to 1.5. Low density, clean solids are removed and recovered 20 . High density material is passed 22 to a crusher 24 and particulate material of 25 to 6 mm is fed from the crusher 24 to a vibrating screen 28 . Fine particles from the screen 28 are passed 30 to a froth separator and clean solids recovered. Coarse particles from the screen 28 are gravimetrically separated in a cleaning cyclone 34 containing washing medium of s.g. 1.5 to 1.9. Low density clean solids are recovered 38, 20 .
