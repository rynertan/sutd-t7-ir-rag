# Process and apparatus for machining a transverse element for a driving belt and transverse element.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for machining a transverse element for a driving belt, which element is provided with a curved surface that can come into contact with an endless carrier of the driving belt. The invention also relates to an apparatus for conduct ing the process and to the transverse element machined by means of the process. Said driving belt consisting of a plurality of transverse elements which have been arranged slidably and also tilt ably on an endless carrier, such as one or two metal band packages, one behind another in the longitudinal direction thereof, is liable to become worn in use. Due to a tilting movement as it enters between the sheaves of the V shaped pulley the sharp edge of the curved surface of the trans verse element comes into contact with the carrier and exerts a relatively very high pressure thereon. In order to eliminate or in any case lessen this draw back and accordingly to provide a process for machining, the curved surface of the transverse element is machined by means of a grinding device giving the surface a curvature in two mutually perpendicular directions.
