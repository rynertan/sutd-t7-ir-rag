# Drying process and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
There is provided a process and apparatus for drying wet solid material. The process comprises introducing wet solid material into a dryer bringing the material into contact with one side of a plurality of heated surfaces located in the dryer and vaporizing liquid contained in the wet solid material. The vaporized liquid is withdrawn from the dryer and compressed to a pressure greater than the pressure in the dryer and then returned to the other side of the plurality of heated surfaces where, upon condensation, the latent heat energy is released therefrom and is used to vaporize liquid contained in wet solid material on the opposite side of the heated surfaces and withdrawing the condensate from the heated surfaces and substantially dried solids from the dryer. The drying apparatus provided comprises a housing 11 having entrance 13 and exit 15 openings and means 17,19 for delivering material to be dried into and dried material from the housing located in the opening and closing and isolating the interior of the dryer from the outside atmosphere. A plural ity of hollow heat exchange means 25,27 are disposed in the interior or the dryer housing and are connected to an external heat source 55 and to the atmosphere. In addition, compres sor means 57 are connected to the housing in the vicinity of the entrance opening 13 and to the hollow heat exchange means, the compressor means operating at positive pressure with respect to the pressure in the housing so that vaporized liquid is withdrawn from the housing or compressed and then led to the hollow heat exchange means 25,27 where it is condensed, giving up its latent heat energy and thus vaporiz ing the liquid in wet solid material on the opposite surfaces of the hollow heat exchange means.
