# Submerged arc welding gun.

## Abstract
A submerged arc welding gun includes a housing 14 having a bore 26 extending therethrough. The housing includes a welding nozzle 16 defining one end. Welding wire 20 is directed through the bore of the housing to said nozzle. A flux tube 22 is disposed in spaced relation to the welding wire for delivering flux from a source 12 thereof to the nozzle. The flux tube terminates substantially adjacent to the nozzle. The flux tube 22 is connected to a source of pressure for feeding the flux through the tube to the nozzle.
