# Automobile towing apparatus.

## Abstract
An automobile towing apparatus for mounting on a tow truck which has a boom consisting of a generally horizontal forward portion 13 connected at its rear end to a portion 14 extending downward, which in turn is connected to a pivoting rear portion 15 . The rear portion 15 is extensible and carries a transverse beam 32 at its rearward end, which in turn carries vehicle lifts to engage and lift the wheels 40 of a vehicle 41 . The transverse beam 32 has a limited rotation about the longitudinal axis of the boom rear portion 15 . The boom forward portion 13 pivots at its front and rear end on horizontal axes 20,25 which may be individually raised and lowered. The pivotal freedom of the transverse beam 32 and the boom allows the loading of vehicles situated on relatively sloping surfaces. The transverse beam 32 also pivots about a generally vertical axis at the rear of the boom rear portion 15 to accommodate misalignment when towing. Brake bars 42 are positioned below beam 32 whilst towing, and engage the ground if the boom rear portion 15 is lowered in emergency.
