# RIBBON CASSETTES

## Abstract
A ribbon cassette of the kind used to store a reel of typing ribbon, comprises a casing 6 , a primary spool 8 mounted an a hub 16 and upon which unused ribbon is wound, and a secondary spool 10 in the casing upon which used ribbon is wound. The secondary spool 10 is provided with means 12 to be engaged by a drive member of e.g. a word processor or computer printer, to cause the secondary spool to rotate, and to draw ribbon from the primary spool onto the secondary spool. The cassette comprises means to resist reverse winding of the primary spool, said means comprising a first toothed ele ment 20 forming part of a fixedly mounted on the primary spool, and a secondary toothed element 21 mounted in a diametral slot 24 , and which is urged into engagement with the first toothed element 20 by spring means 28 . Engage ment between the two toothed elements permits normal win ding of tape onto the secondary spool from the primary spool, but resists reverse winding of the primary spool. The spring element 28 engages the ribbon, to maintain tension in the ribbon during use. Additionally, the ribbon cassette comprises an insert member 80 comprising an operative portion which may be in serted through a slot 78 in the base 6 into a position in which it engages the primary spool to prevent rotation thereof during transportation, the insert member comprising a supplementary portion located on the exterior of the casing which may be manually grasped to enable the insert member to be removed from the casing of the ribbon cassette in preparation for use thereof.
