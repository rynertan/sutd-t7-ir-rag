# Fuel air mixing device for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A device 6 forimproving the fuel efficiency of an internal combustion engine by increasing the degree of mixing of the fuel air mixture before it enters the engine is preferably located between a carburetor 2 and a manifold body 4 . The device comprises a supporting plate 16 with an opening 20 aligned with and corresponding in size to a barrel 12 of the carburetor 2 . A truncated cone 22 surrounds the opening 20 and tapers away from it. The supporting plate 16 is mounted so that fuel entering the device flows through the large end 28 of the cone 22 first. A spacer plate 8 can be used with the device 6 . In the case of multi barrel car buretors, there is one opening for each barrel of the car buretor and at least one of the openings has a corresponding cone.
