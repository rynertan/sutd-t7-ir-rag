# Portable air filtration device.

## Abstract
A Coanda type air mover 16 is mounted vertically on a hollow base 10 to draw air through the base from filtering means comprising a pre filter 26 and an absolute HEPA filter 28. The air mover discharges the filtered air upwards. The two filters are stacked on the base for air to be drawn downwards through them from an inlet duct 30 leading horizontally from a contaminated air inlet 32 of the device. An air tight cover 34 can be secured to cover the inlet 32 of the duct when the equipment is not in use, enabling contaminated filters to be left in place during transportation. The portable device may be used for withdrawing and cleaning fibreladen air from a working space where asbestos stripping is taking place.
