# Moisture curable sealant compositions.

## Abstract
The specification is concerned with sealant composi tions comprising prepolymers which are capable of being cured by atmospheric moisture. The compositions provide a desirable blend of properties with regard to application and use, using prepolymers derived from comparatively inex pensive raw materials. The prepolymers correspond to a reaction product of an at least substantially linear acrylate ester polymer having a Tg of not greater than 10 C with a hydrolysable silane having a saturated organo functional group, the reaction product being a fluid material soluble in organic solvents and curable by exposure to atmospheric moisture to a resilient solid. The prepolymer is a silane modified polymer which preferably has from 2 to 3 hydrolys able silane groups per molecule of prepoiymer and from 1 to 3 hydrolysable groups per silane group. Preferred acrylate ester polymers are homo or co polymers of butyl acrylate copolymers may contain other acrylate monomers and or may contain up to 50 wt vinyl monomer e.g. styrene. Preferred silanes are amino silanes particularly those having 2 or 3 hydrolysable alkoxy groups. Also described and claimed are methods of making the prepolymers. The compositions are suited for construction and glazing sea lants.
