## Description
This invention pertains to a method for gasification of coal and or coke whereby the coal and or coke is gasified by reaction with added water vapor in the presence of added catalyst and the gas is purified with respect to constituents that are detrimental to the environment whereafter the gas may be burned. The purification pertains especially to sulfur and heavy metals. Fossil fuels contain on the average about 2 of sulfur. The sulfur content of coals is usually between 0.5 and 2.5 , depending upon the location of the mine. The sulfur in coals has the forms of organic compounds, usually up to 0.5 , and the mineral pyrite, FeS₂. Coals also contain other metals, especially heavy metals, e.g. mercury. When coals are burned in a furnace or a fireplace in the conventional manner, their constituents are converted into oxides that are emitted into the flue gas. The sulfur dioxide, SO₂, is converted in the atmosphere or on the ground to sulfuric acid,H₂SO₄. At the present yearly rate of burning of fossil fuels, about 6 billion tons, the surface of the earth receives about 1 million tons of H₂SO₄ per day. In principle, H₂SO₄ can be bound in calcium sulfate, gypsum, CaSO₄, by means of added lime, but in practice this is hardly possible to the required or even to a significant extent. The metal oxides have the form of small particles, less than 1 µ in diameter. They cannot be removed from the flue gas by known methods. Some heavy metals, e.g. tungsten and molybdenum, have gaseous oxides. The flue gases from the combustion of fossil fuels have caused, and continue to cause, enormous harms, some known ones and, presumably, some unknown ones. The most conspicuous ones are mercury poisoning of fish in lakes, and sick, dying and dead trees in forests. The sulfuric acid may be neutralized by the lime in the soil. When the soil becomes acidic and acidification damage is noticeable, the lime is spent, at first, of course, in a surface layer in which trees and other plants have their roots. In this condition the soil cannot endure further addition of acid. Among the effects of H₂SO₄ is the dissolution of aluminum in the silicates that constitute clay. In this process are formed poisonous aluminum sulfate, Al₂ SO₄ ₃, that is soluble in the surface water and in the ground water, and silicon dioxide, SiO₂, sand. If the Al₂ SO₄ ₃ is precipitated with lime, it is converted into colloidal aluminum oxide, Al₂O₃, dispersed in the surface water and in the ground water. The destruction of the environment by flue gases from fossil fuels is an immediate and imminent threat to the conditions for life and of the basis for its support. The harm already done cannot be undone. But continued destruction can be prevented by the use of a suitable combustion technology. It must satisfy the following requirements The invention meets these requirements. A solid fuel, e.g. coal, does not burn as such but only after gasification whereupon the gas burns. Since the gas burns, it is reducing. The combustion takes place in oxidizing air. Gasification and combustion thus occur under different circumstances. By conducting the two processes separately one can give each process the most favorable circumstances. In addition, the gas can be purified before its combustion. Coal is converted into gas by three main methods. The products called city gas, producer gas, and water gas, respectively. The city gas is produced by heating coal in the absence of air. Compounds of carbon and hydrogen in the coal then give off a gas that consists after purification of 40 56 H₂, 24 30 , CH₄, 4 8 CO, 4 10 N₂, 2 3 heavy hydrocarbons, 1 2 CO₂, 1 O₂. Before purification the gas contains sulfur in the form of hydrogen sulfide, H₂S. It is taken up by bog ore as FeS that decomposes in the air to yield bog ore and elementary sulfur, called flowers of sulfur. The removal of sulfur is practically complete. After degasing of the coal,the residue is coke. In a gasworks a ton of coal yields about 350 m³ of gas and 700 kg of coke. The process is conducted in a chamber, the wall of which is heated at the outside by burning the product gas or of producer gas from the product coke. In a typical case the temperature in the chamber is about 1100 The producer gas is produced by incomplete burning of coke in air. The composition is approximately 55 N₂, 20 CO, 13 H₂, 8 CO₂, 3 CH₄. The gas is produced near the point of use so that the heat content of the gas can be utilized as well as its heat of combustion, e.g. in the Siemens Martin process. The water gas is produced from coke and water vapor This reaction is used in the method according to the invention. It is treated extensively in the following. In practice the raw materials contain contaminants that affect reactions and products. As a consequence, all coals are not suitable for the production of, e.g. city gas. Also as a consequence, the three gases are mixtures of one another in different proportions. Some of the reactions that are part of the gas production are catalyzed by metals which are contained in the coal as impurities. This effect, as well as the influence of impurities in general, has been insufficiently investigated. According to the invention, coal and or coke is gasified according to 1 with added catalyst in addition to that present as an impurity. In order for the reaction with H₂O to occur according to 1 , it is necessary that H₂O be decomposed This decomposition is catalyzed by any hydrogen replacing metal. It is further required that the reaction yield the products stated in 1 . This requires a catalyst of a more specific kind. One such metal is iron, but similar metals, especially cobalt and nickel, can, in principle, be used too. However, according to the invention, iron is preferable. With iron as a catalyst the reaction 1 takes place within the austenite domain of iron, according to the phase diagram for the system Fe C in the temperature range 728 1490 The iron may be added as metal or as iron oxide. In the former case the iron becomes partially oxidized by H₂O, in the latter case the iron oxide becomes partially reduced by H₂. On this subject the following comments may be made. Iron and other metals are oxidized by OH, e.g. as formed according to 2 . Oxygen contributes to the oxidation only after conversion into OH This requires a catalyst that decomposes H₂O₂. Many metals, including iron, decompose H₂O₂ according to 4 . As a consequence of this reaction mechanism, first published by Wieland Ber. 46 1913 3327 , metals are oxidized in oxygen or air only in the presence of H₂O. Even under these conditions, metals that do not decompose H₂O₂, e.g. aluminum, are oxidized only to the extent that they contain metals, e.g. Fe and Cu, that decompose H₂O₂. The reverse reaction, reduction of metal oxides, is effected by atomic hydrogen alone. It is formed in, e.g. the reaction 2 , or from H₂ by the reaction It follows from what has just been said, that gasification of coal or coke according to 1 in the presence of iron or iron oxide, and reduction of iron oxide in the presence of coal or coke, are elements of one and the same reaction mechanism. According to the invention, these two elements are combined in one and the same process in one and the same reactor. The composition of the charge of the reactor, especially the proportions of coal and or coke, iron and or iron oxide, and water vapor, are then chosen such that the desired proportions of the products, gas and iron, are obtained. An essential advantage of this combination is that it allows adjustment to variations in the demand. In summer time the need of gas for heating is less. This can be compensated by a greater production of iron that can be stored. Since the gas can be stored in a gasholder, as is city gas, the variations over the day can be compensated. By the use of a catalyst the process is accelerated, and the volume of the plant and with it the capital cost, is reduced. The iron produced in the process described has the form of sponge iron. It contains unreduced iron oxide and also sulfur, taken up from the coal or coke. It can be completely reduced by treatment with purified gas, that does not contain sulfur, and without addition of coal or coke. In this process sulfur is removed from the sponge iron in the form of H₂S that is returned to the purification plant. Under suitably chosen conditions phosphorus and carbon can also be removed from the sponge iron. The gas formed in the gasification can be purified by known methods. Condensable constituents are removed by cooling in heat exchanger. Sulfur, in the form of H₂S, is taken up by bog ore. The purification is done essentially by the method used in gasworks for the production of city gas. This invention thus pertains to a process for the gasification of coal and or coke in a reactor, in combination with the purification of the gas obtained with respect to sulfur, in the form of hydrogen sulfide, vapors of metals and metal oxides, and other constituents, the purification being effected by known methods, e.g. by means of cooling and treatment with bog ore, characterized by the gasification of the coal and or coke in the presence of a catalyst, especially a metal from the group iron, cobalt and nickel, and water in the form of water vapor that is injected in the reactor, and also characterized thereby that, depending upon the proportions of the quantities of coal and or coke, metal, metal oxide, and water vapor introduced in the reactor, gas and or metal are is taken out from the reactor, the metal in the form of, e.g., sponge metal. The gasification of coal and or coke according to the invention is effected at a temperature in the range of about 728 1490 In a preferred form of the method according to the invention, the catalyst is particulate iron or particulate iron oxide. In one form of the method according to the invention the metal that is obtained from the reactor is purified with respect to sulfur and also with respect to phosphorus and or carbon by treatment with purified gas. The purified gas produced according to the invention may be used in electric power plants without the need of filter for fly ash and a tall smoke stack with attendant energy losses. Also, losses by corrosion are reduced. The purified gas may evidently be used for other purposes, e.g. in metallurgical processes. Thus, one may effect final reduction of the produced sponge iron to iron powder by treatment with the purified gas, thereby, as already mentioned, also removing sulfur, phosphorus and carbon. Another area of application of the purified gas is in households, e.g. for heating. The method according to the invention meets the requirements a. and b. as has been explained at length above. The requirement c. may warrant additional comments. The use of a catalyst for the gasification of the coal and or coke, greatly increases the rate of the process. As a consequence, the site of the reactor is reduced correspondingly and thereby its capital costs. When a gas is the sole product, and when iron is the sole product, catalyst and coal and or coke are costs that must be kept low. When gas and iron are both useful products and produced together, these restrictions do not apply. As a consequence more favorable operating conditions can be chosen. For example, iron ore is more rapidly reduced in a highly reducing atmosphere, i.e. at an excess of coal and or coke and steam as compared to the theoretical minimum. As a consequence, the size of the plant is reduced for a given capacity with consequent reduction of capital costs. Furthermore, the optimum capacity of the plant, e.g. 2 million tons per year of a blast furnace, is greatly reduced, again with a reduction of capital costs. Capital costs are largely determined by the degree of utilization of the plant. The combination of the two products, gas and iron, allows a high degree of utilization as compared to either product alone. As a consequence capital costs are reduced. Furthermore, the combination of the two products, each of which can be stored, allows a minimum of surplus capacity, again at a reduction of capital costs. The purified gas can be used for purposes where the not purified gas cannot. The purified gas therefore has a correspondingly higher price in the market.
