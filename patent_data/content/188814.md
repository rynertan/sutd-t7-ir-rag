# A process for producing an alpha alkyl substituted aromatic vinyl copolymer and a thermoplastic resin composition comprising the copolymer.

## Abstract
A process for producing an α alkyl substituted aromatic vinyl copolymer constituted of 60 to 85 parts by weight of the α alkyl substituted aromatic vinyl monomer, 15 to 35 parts by weight of a vinyl cyanide monomer, and 0 to 40 parts by weight of another vinyl monomer copolymerizable with these mono mers, which process is characterized in that all the amount of the aromatic vinyl monomer necessary for the entire polymerization and such partial amounts of the vi nyl cyanide monomer and another copolymerizable vinyl mono mer as to give a predetermined copolymer composition with respect to the content of the aromatic vinyl monomer, are first charged and emulsified and the emulsion polymerization is then initiated and carried out by adding dropwise continuously the residual amounts of the vinyl cyanide monomer and another copolymerizable vinyl monomer in such a manner that the range of change in the content of the aromatic vinyl monomer in the copolymer during the polymerization reaction will not vary more than 2 in the range of conversion of 0 to 90 and a thermoplastic resin composition comprising A 50 to 90 by weight of a copolymer constituted of 60 to 85 parts by weight of an α alkyl substituted aromatic vinyl monomer, 15 to 35 parts by weight of a vinyl cyanide monomer, and 0 to 40 parts by weight of another vinyl monomer copoly merizable with these monomers, the copolymer being pro duced in such a manner that the range of change in the content of the aromatic vinyl monomer in the copolymer during the polymerization reaction will not vary more than 2 in the range of conversion of 0 to 90,and B 10 to 50 by weight of a graft copolymer constituted of 30 to 85 parts by weight of a rubbery polymer and 15 to 70 parts by weight of a grafted polymer consisting of a monovinyl aromatic monomer, vinyl cya nide monomer, and another monomer copolymerizable with them in respective proportions of 85 40 0 40 0 80, where the total amount of polymers A and B is 100 by weight.
