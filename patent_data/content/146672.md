# Drive apparatus for a liquid crystal dazzle free mirror arrangement.

## Abstract
A drive apparatus for a liquid crystal dazzlement pre venting mirror arrangement 80 for automatically setting a liquid crystal panel of the mirror arrangement 80 to a dazzlement preventing state by detecting illuminance on the mirror surface and brightness in region near the mirror. An incident light detecting unit 4 detects incident light onto the mirror. An ambient light detecting unit 5 detects brightness in a region around the mirror. A control unit 6 receives both the incident light and the ambient light signals and produces a control signal for driving the liquid crystal panel through a drive unit 7 . The apparatus includes an illuminance descri mination function, which is performed in such a manner that in the event of the illuminance on the mirror surface is higher than first prescribed set value of incident light illuminance and the illuminance in region around the mirror is lower than a prescribed set value of ambient light illuminance, the dazzlement preventing state is provided, and that in the event of the incident light illuminance is higher than a second prescribed set value of incident light illuminance which is higher than that of the first set value, irrespective of the ambient light illuminance, the dazzlement preventing state is also provided.
