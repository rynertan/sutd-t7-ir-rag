## Description
DEVICE FOR LOCKING INTERENGAGED MEMBERS This invention relates to laboratory accessory equipment, and more particularly to a means that can both lock and retract a male member from a female member. There is a frequent need in laboratories to be able to lock a male member to a female member, such as an adapter within a flask, especially when the flask contains a pressurized fluid, and there is a danger of accidental separation. A similar requirement exists for locking a stopcock in a selected position within its glassware housing. In the past, this problem was handled by merely forcing the members together with their complementary surfaces in engagement and hoping they would stay seated in sealing contact until their intentional separation.Unfortunately, many experiments have been aborted because the male member could not be positively locked in seated relation within the female member, or the male member could not be safely removed from the female member because the members were stuck or frozen together. This problem was partially addressed to in my recently issued U.S. patents 4,391,779 and 4,395,382, which patents disclose a retractor nut for removing a frozen stopper member and stopcock member from their respective female members. However, these patent did not discuss this problem of locking the members together, nor disclose any means for positively locking together the seated members together under a pressurized environment. A locking means is provided having a dual function, namely of being able to positively lock a male member, such as a laboratory adaptor or stopcock in sealed contact within their respective female housing, and also, when the need arises, to facilitate the separation of the members, especially when they are stuck or frozen together. This invention uniquely utilizes the existing out wardly projecting peripheral lip conventionally formed around the necK of most female glassware members on the market during fabrication. In the preferred embodiment, the novel locking means is a sleeve shaped nut having a pair of spaced shoulders between which is captured the female lip. A sleeve end of the nut is slotted along its wall a sufficient width to enable the nut to be mounted around, and detached from, the neck of the female member from a lateral position. The slot in the sleeve has a stepped configuration with the width of the larger slot gap being substantially the same diameter of the female lip to allow the lip to be press fitted into the sleeve.The width of the smaller gap is smaller than the diameter of the female fip by an inwardly projecting Xip wh which functions as one of the shoulders, and substantially the same size as the neck of the female member to allow lateral entry in the sleeve. Accordingly, the sleeve nut can be laterally mounted around the neck of the female member with the shoulder formed by the stepped slot abutting the underside of the female lip and preventing longitudinal separation of the nut and the female lip. The end of the nut portion, opposite the sleeve lip, has a central opening which is threaded to receive an outwardly threaded portion formed on the male member. The threaded central opening is smaller in diameter than the bore diameter of the sleeve portion forming an inner transverse wall which forms the other shoulder for abutting against the topside of the female lip. To lock the male member to the female member, the nut portion of the sleeve is rotated on the male member to move the nut away from the female tubing until one of the shoulders engages one side of the female lip to draw the members into a locked, tight sealed engagement. To separate the male and female members, especially when stuck or frozen together, the nut is rotated on the male member in the opposite direction until the other shoulder in the sleeve portion engages the other side of the female lip and the rotational force is converted into an axial force on the male member pulling it free from the engagement within the female member without danger of breakage of either member. A principal object of this invention is to provide a locking and retracting means for a pair of mating male and female members capable of locking the members in mating assembly to preventing accidental separation, and of being capable of retracting the male member from the female member in a simple and safe manner. Another important object is to fabricate such locking and retracting means having a nut portion and a sleeve portion in a one piece integral construction. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevation view of an assembled frusto conical female member, such as the neck of a laboratory flask, mated to a corresponding male member, such as a laboratory adapter, on which is mounted the novel dual locking and retracting sleeve nut of this invention Figure 2 is an exploded view of the assembly of Figure 1, with the sleeve nut rotated 90 degrees from the position in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a bottom perspective view of the novel sleeve nut Figure 4 is a partial enlarged cross sectional view of the assembly in Figure 1 showing the novel sleeve nut in position locking the male and female members together Figure 5 is a similar view of Figure 4 showing the novel sleeve nut in a position retracting the male member from within the female member Figure 6 is a side elevation view of a modified nov el dual locking and retracting sleeve nut mounted on a conventional stopcock assembly, showing the sleeve nut in cross section, in a position locking the stopcock in a selected position and Figure 7 is a similar view as Figure 6 with a side view of the sleeve nut is shown in a position to retract the stopcock from its housing. Referring to the drawing where like reference numerals refer to similar parts throughout the Figures, there is shown in Figure 1 an assembly of a male member, such as a laboratory adapter 10, having a frusto conical male surface 12 at one end seated in a female member, such as a laboratory flask neck 14, having a complementary female frusto conical surface 16. Surfaces 12 and 16 can be smooth or ground, although the latter surface is usually preferred. This invention is applicable to female members fabricated with an outwardly extending peripheral lip 18 around the female end surface being conventional in the laboratory art.The male member can be a solid stopper type member, or as shown in Figure 1 an adapter type stopper 10 having a longitudinally drilled bore opening through which a vacuum or pressure can be introduced in flask 14, or as shown in Figures 6 and 7, a stopcock type stopper, or any other conventional male and female mated tubing. Adapter 10 illustrated in Figures 1 5 is similar to the one described in my copending patent application Serial Number 501,275 entitled Multiple Use Laboratory Kit . The other end of adapter 10 is fabricated with an exterior threaded section 22 on which can be threadedly mounted a novel locking and retracting sleeve nut 23 having a threaded bore opening 24 at one end to receive male threads 22, as best shown in Figure 3. Sleeve nut 23 is preferably made of plastic material with its outer peripheral surface knurled at 25. The end of sleeve nut con taining threads 24 functions as a nut portion 26, and the other integral end is an integral sleeve portion 28 for receiving both lip 18 and neck 29 of flask 14 in a manner to be described. Threaded bore 24 of nut portion 26 is smaller in diameter than the diameter of sleeve bore 30 forming an annular transverse wall which acts as a shoulder 38.The end of sleeve portion 28, opposite to nut portion 26, terminates in an inwardly directed annular lip forming a second transverse shoulder spaced from shoulder 38. Shoulder 36 forms a central opening 34 which is larger in diameter than flask neck 29, but smaller in diameter than flask kip 18. The diameter of sleeve bore 30 is larger in diameter than flask lip 18.A portion of the wall or sleeve portion 28 is longitudinally slotted at 32 in a stepped configuration having a width capable of allowing the lateral passage of both flask lip 18 and neck 29 through the respective slotted openings into longitudinal alignment within sleeve portion 28. The width of stepped slot 32 is preferably dimensioned so that both the lip and the neck of the flask can be snap fitted therethrough, relying on the resiliency of the plastic material to retain the sleeve nut 23 in position on the flask until intentional removal. The operation of the adapter type assembly of Figures 1 5 is best illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. Sleeve nut 23 is first slipped on the flask neck from a lateral direction with flask lip 18 and neck 29 passing through the stepped slot 32 to be longitudinally aligned therewith. In this position, flask lip 18 is longitudinally confined between spaced shoulders 36 and 38. Adapter 10 is then longitudinally threaded through sleeve nut 23, in the direction of arrow 37 in Figure 4, until surfaces 12 and 16 initially engage. To tightly lock the adapter within the flask, sleeve nut 23 is rotated on the adapter in a direction away from flask 14 until shoulder 36 abuts the underside of lip 18 and the sleeve nut is not longer turnable. When it becomes necessary to separate adapter 10 from flask 14 and break the seal between the frusto conical surfaces, sleeve nut 23 is rotated in an opposite direction, namely toward flask 14, until shoulder 38 first contacts the top side of flask lip 18, as in Figure 5. A slight additional rotational force on nut 23 in the same direction applies an axial retracting force on the adapter, in the direction of arrow 40 in Figure 5, to break the seal between the surfaces and free the adapter fron the flask. Tc disassemble the members it is first necessary to remove adapter 10 completely out of sleeve nut 23 at whicn time nut can be slipped off flask 14 in a lateral direction, as in Figure 2. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the application of the novel sleeve nut 50 to a typical stopcock assembly 52, which is another type of female member on which the invention can be employed. Assembly 52 consists of a housing 54 having a tapered bore 55 in which is sealably a corresponding tapered stopcock body 56 provided with a handle 58 at the larger diameter end, and a threaded stud portion 60 at the smaller diameter end. An inherent characteristic of all stopcock housing is the peripheral lips 61 and 62 at the opposite ends of tapered bore 55. Sleeve nut 50 is similar in construction to sleeve nut 23 in Figures 1 5 consisting of a nut portion 63 and an integral sleeve portion 64, the outer surfaces may be knurled at 65. Nut portion 63 has a central threaded opening 66 to receive threaded stud 60 of the stopcock body, and an inner transverse shoulder 68 adapted to abut the end of lip 62 of the stopcock housing. The end of sleeve portion 64 terminates in an inwardly projecting annular shoulder 70 forming a central opening 72 the diameter of which is slightly larger than the diameter of the stopcock housing adjacent to its lip 62, but less in diameter than lip 62. A portion of the side wall of sleeve portion 64 is slotted at 76 at a sufficient width to allow passage therethrough lip 62 and the neck of the housing, preferably in a snap fitting contact to enable lip 62 to be captured between 68 and 70. The operation of sleeve nut 50 is similar to that described for the adapter assembly 10 in Figures 1 5, with the exception that the direction of rotation of sleeve nut 50 is reversed for the locking and retracting operation. Stopcock body 56 is pulled into its housing 54 to be seated, see arrow 78 in Figure 6, rather than the pushing force required in the adapter assembly inFigures 1 5. Likewise, stopcock body 56 is pushed out of its housing, see arrow 80 in figure 7, during the retraction operation rather than being pulled out in Figures 1 5. The novel sleeve nuts 23 and 50 of this invention utilize the conventional structure of laboratory wares which are fabricated with peripherals lips around their female openings, to perform a dual function, namely of both locking the male member within the female member, which is of significant importance if the male member is subject to a pressurized medium within the female member and of enabling the male member to be withdrawn from the female member, when desired, in a safe and expedient manner, especially when the members are stuck or frozen together. The sleeve nuts can be inexpensively fabricated of plastic material in a single piece construction, and be designed to snap fit around the female member and be captured thereon to prevent accidental displacement.
