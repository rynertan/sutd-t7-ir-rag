# Apparatus for coating optical transmission glass fibers.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for coating optical transmis sion glass fibers with a resinous compositon. A vessel is provided through which a glass fiber is drawn. While it is being drawn through the vessel, the fiber is spun, and a resin coating is applied. In order to maintain the air pres sure within the vessel fairly constant, an exhaust vent is provided through which excess particles of the resinous compositon may escape. Turbulence is thus substantially reduced preventing the fiber from swinging and allowing the particles to be sprayed smoothly. Further, the particles may be electrically charged so that they are both attracted to the optical fiber and repel one another during flight. The invention employs both of these features to produce a uniform coat on a optical transmission glass fiber.
