# BILATERAL DIGITAL FSK COMMUNICATION SYSTEM INTERFACE USING DIGITAL TECHNIQUE

## Abstract
A bilateral digital FSK communication system communi cates with a desired module. Connected to a terminal is a digital FSK modem having a clock that provides a pair of signal frequencies, the lower frequency representing a mark and the higher frequency representing a space. An FSK modulator receives a data signal from the terminal and the mark and space frequency from the clock and selects either a mark or space frequency depending upon the corresponding data signal. The output from the modulator is then applied to a light emitting diode which transmits a mark or space signal frequency down a fiber optic line. A mark or a space signal frequency is received on a fiber optic line from the desired module by the modem. A demodulator receives and identi fies the mark or the space frequency signal and provides a corresponding data signal to the terminal.
