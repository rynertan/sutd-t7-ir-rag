# Fluid actuated vehicle temperature control system.

## Abstract
A vehicle temperature control system 10 includes a con trol assembly 12 for directing a fluid actuaging medium to se lected ones of a plurality of door actuators 22, 24, 26 to posi tion a plurality of doors 14, 16, 18 in selected modes of opera tion. The control assembly includes a valve housing 48 defin ing a chamber 110 , a fluid inlet passage 226 and a plurality of opposed inlet cavities 234, 236, 238 and outlet passages 176, 178, 180 . A slide valve 112 is shiftable within the cham ber by means of a mode selection lever 56 . An array of con trol passages 144, 146, 148 defined by the slide valve selec tively place the inlet cavities in communication with the outlet passages. Seal members 260 are disposed in each of the in let cavities and outlet passages to ensure that the fluid medi um passes through the control passages. The mode selection lever also defines a cam surface 88 for selectlvely acutating an air conditioner compressor switch 80 .
