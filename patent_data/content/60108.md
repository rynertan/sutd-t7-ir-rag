# Address buffer.

## Abstract
An address buffer circuit for a dynamic memory com prises a flip flop FF , connected at one input output terminal N₁ with first input circuitry IN₁ in parallel with third input circuitry IN₃ , and at its other input output terminal N₂ with second input circuitry IN₂ preferably in parallel with fourth input circuitry IN₄ . The second input circuitry receives a reference voltage REF and is activated by a timing clock
