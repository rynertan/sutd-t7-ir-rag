# Process for the preparation of cationic resins, aqueous dispersions thereof, and electrodeposition using the aqueous dispersions.

## Abstract
An improved process for the preparation of cationic resins derived from polyepoxides is disclosed. Typically, the process comprises contacting the polyepoxide with particu lar polyether polyols and heating the two together to form a resin which may then be reacted with a cationic base group former such as an amine and acid. Aqueous dispersions of the cationic resins prepared by the improved process are useful for coating applications, particularly cationic elec trodeposition. They exhibit good low temperature cure response and the cured coatings have good physical prop erties such as resistance to water, detergent and salt spray corrosion.
