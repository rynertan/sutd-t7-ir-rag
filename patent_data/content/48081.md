# DNA CAPABLE OF REPLICATION AND STABLE MITOTIC MAINTENANCE IN A HOST EUKARYOTE, METHOD OF PREPARATION THEREOF AND EUKARYOTIC CELL CONTAINING SAME

## Abstract
Functioning eukaryotic minichromosomes containing a centromere, at least one replicating site, and at least one functioning structural gene. Centromeres are obtained from a host chromosome and used as a genetic unit in combina tion with an autonomously replicating segment for high frequency stable transformation of host and other eukaryotic cells. The transformed eukaryotic cells can be cultivated through repeated passages without significant loss of the minichromosome and continued expression of the structural genes present in the minichromosome.
