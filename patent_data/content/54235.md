# Fuel assembly for a nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
A fuel assembly in a nuclear reactor comprises a locking mechanism that is capable of locking the fuel assembly to the core plate of a nuclear reactor to prevent inadvertent movement of the fuel assembly. The locking mechanism comprises a ratchet mechanism that allows the fuel assem bly to be easily locked to the core plate but prevents unlocking except when the ratchet is disengaged.
