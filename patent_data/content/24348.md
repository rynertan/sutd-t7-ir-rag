A preferred embodiment of this invention relates to those structures of general formula I wherein A is H or methyl E is CH CH , CH2CH2 or CH2CH2CH R1, R2 and R3 are each selected from halogen, c14 alkyl, C1 4 haloalkyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl in which the substituent is halo, C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, and R40 in which R4 is phenyl, halophenyl, or substituted phenyl C13 alkyl wherein the substituents are selected from halogen and C1 4 haloalkyl and the corresponding dihydroxy acids resulting from the hydrolytic opening of the lactone ring and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said dihydroxy acids, and the lower alkyl and phenyl, dimethylamino or acetylamino substituted lower alkyl esters of said dihydroxy acids all said compounds being the enantiomer having a 4 R configuration in the tetrahydropyran moiety of the trans racemate shown in general fromula I. The most preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises those structures of general formula I wherein A is H or methyl E is CH2CH2 or CH CH R1 is situated ortho to E and is halophenyloxy, halophenylalkoxy or halophenyl, especially where halo is fluoro or chloro R2 and R3 are halo, especially chloro, in the 4 and 6 positions and the corresponding dihydroxy acids resulting from the hydrolytic opening of the lactone ring, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said dihydroxy acids, and the lower alkyl and phenyl, dimethylamino or acetylamino substituted lower alkyl esters of said dihydroxy acids all said compounds being the enantiomer having a 4 R configuration in the tetrahydropyran moiety of the trans racemate shown in general formula I. The compounds in which R1 is halophenyl, especially fluoroph nyl and chlorophenyl, are especially to be preferred. The designation 4 R with respect to these compounds indicates that the absolute configuration in space at the 4 carbon of the pyranone ring is believed to be the Rectus R . series. All the compounds synthesized have been found to be dextrorotatory. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known that certain mevalonate derivatives inhibit the biosynthesis of cholesterol, cf F.M. Singer, et al., Proc. Soc. Exper. Biol. Med., 102, 270 1959 and F. H. Hulcher, Arch. Biochem.Biophys., 146, 422 t1971 . Nevertheless, the activity of these known compounds has not always been found to be satisfactory, i.e. to have practical application. Recently, Endo et al, reported U.S. LettersPatent 4,049,495, Patent 4,137,322 and Patent 3,983,140 the production of a fermentation product which was quite active in the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. This natural product, now called compactin, was reported by Brown et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 1165 1976 to have a complex mevaloflolactone structure. However, the low rate of production from fermentation broths appears to limit the supply of this natural product. A recent Belgian patent 867,421 disclosed a group of synthetic compounds of the generic formulaIIEMI5.1 in which E represents a direct bond, a C13 alkylene bridge or a vinylene bridge and the various R s represent a variety of substitutents. The activity reported in the Belgian patent is less than 1 that of compactin.THE PRESENT INVENTION We have found that the enantiomers of the trans compounds of Formula I having a 4 R.configur ation in the tetrahydropyran moiety, especially those in which A is hydrogen, and most especially those having a 2,4,6 trisubstitution pattern on the aromatic ring wherein R1 and R2 are C1 in the 2 and 4 position and R3 is phenoxy, phenylalkoxy or phenyl in the 6 position, are unexpectedly potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, approaching and surpassing the order of magnitude of compactin. While the compounds of Formula I in whichA is methyl are 4 R enantiomers of the trans racemates of the compounds of the cited Belgian patent, the latter prior art shows no recognition of the stereochemistry of these compounds, let alone the fact that an unexpectedly large improvement in the activity would result from the separation of the cis and trans racemates and the latter s resolution, especially when the preferred 2,4,6 trisubstitution occurs in the phenyl ring. However, it has been found that the 4 R enantiomers of the trans racemates corresponding to formula I specifically inhibit with high potency the activity of 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which is known to be the rate limiting enzyme in the process of biosynthesis of cholesterol. The inhibitory activity of these compounds for the biosynthesis of cholesterol has been measured by two methods. The experimental method A has been realized in vitro by the method of II. J. Knauss, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 234, 2835 1959 . and the activity was expressed as the molar concentration IC50 CM necessary for the inhibition of 50 of the enzymatic activity. The experimental method B was the method of A. A. Kandutsch, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 248, 8403 1973 for measuring the quantity of 14C cholesterol biosynthesis from acetic acid 14C in mouse L cells. The activity is expressed for inhibition of 50 of the biosynthesis of cholesterol. The results obtained in these two assays, as reported in the cited Belgian patent, show IC50 values of 10 4 to 10 6 in both tests. The smallest 50t effective do cited is about 4 x 106 whereas the value for compactin, in the same tests, is about 0.8 x 10 8. We have found that the inhibitory potency is greatly increased by such isomer separation, especially when this is combined with optimal selection of a 2,4,6 arrangement of R1, R2 and R3 in the phenyl ring i.e. selection of R1 and R2 as 2,4 dichloro and R3 as 6 phenoxy or phenylalkoxy , especially with a halogen tpreferrably fluorine on the 6 phenoxy or phenylalkoxy group. Thus the trans enantiomer of 6 2 .2 ,4 dichloro 6 phenylmethoxyphenyl ethyl 3,4,5,6 tetrahydro 4 hydroxy 2H pyran 2 one Example 14 a preferred compound of this invention gives anIC50 of 6.8 x 10 8 in the test by method A. An even more potent and preferred compound of this invention, the trans enantiomer of 6 12 2,4 dichloro 6 E fluorphenyl ethenyl 3,4,5,6 tetrahydro 4 hydroxy2H pyran 2 one Example 38 gives an IC50 of about 2.8 x 10 , a potency greater than that of compactin, the product described by Endo, when the two compounds are tested as the sodium salts of their corresponding hydroxy acid forms. In the compounds of formula I which form this invention, A may be hydrogen or methyl, but hydrogen is preferred. The connecting group E between the rings may be a direct bond, an unsaturated ethylenyl CH CH or methylene CH2 , ethylene CH2 CH2 or trimethylene CH2 CH2 CH2 .Preferred is the ethylene bridge CH2 CH2 in the case where R1 is phenoxy or phenalkoxy and ethylenyl CH CH when R1 is phenyl. The substitutents on the benzene ring inFormula I, R1, R2 and R3, may be hydrogen, halogen F, C1, Br or I with F or C1 preferred , C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 haloalkyl halo as above , phenyl, substituted phenyl in which the substi tuent is halogen, C1 4 alkoxy, C2 3 alkanoyloxy, or Cl4 haloalkyl halo as above , hydroxyl, or substituted hydroxyl in which the sub stitutent is C19 alkyl, C2 8 alkanoyl, benzoyl, phenyl, halophenyl, phenyl Cl 3 alkyl, cinnamyl, C1 4 haloalkyl, allyl, Cycloalkyl C13 alkyl, adamantyl C13 alkyl, or substituted phenyl C13 alkyl, in which the substituent is halogen as above , C1 4 alkoxy, C1 4 alkyl or C1 4 haloalkyl halo as above The preparation of the compounds of this invention is illustrated in the Flow Sheets. Flow Sheet I shows the general scheme for synthesizing compounds with a vinylene bridge between the lactone and benzene rings. A starting benzaldehyde is converted to the corresponding cinnamaldehyde this forms the bridging group and this is subjected to an aldol reaction to elaborate a hydroxy keto ester from the terminal aldehydic moiety. Reduction of the hydroxy keto ester affords the dihydroxy ester which upon lactonization, gives the lactone. The lactone is then separated chromatographicaily into its cis and trans racemates and the latter racemate is resolved to give the desired 4 R trans enantiomer. Flow Sheet II shows the further conversion of the 4 R trans lactones into the corresponding dihydroxy acids and their salts and esters. Although this sequence is shown with the CH CH bridged compounds, the same sequence can be used to give the corresponding acids, salts and esters of any of the other bridged compounds. Flow Sheet III shows the synthetic routes for the preparation of the alternative bridging groups, represented by E in formula I. Compounds with a direct bond between the lactone and phenyl rings are made by the process of Flow Sheet I with omission of step 2. In this instance, the starting benzaldehyde is used directly in the Aldol reaction.Compounds with a methylene CH2 bridge are prepared by starting with the appropriate phenylacetaldehyde in place of the cinnamaldehyde. Compounds with an ethylene CH2 CH2 bridge between the rings are prepared by reduction of the vinylene bridged compounds prepared in Flow Sheet I. Compounds with a trimethylene bridge CH2 CH2 CH2 are prepared by starting with the appropriate l bromo 3 phenylpropane.Compounds of formula I wherein A is a methyl group are prepared as indicated in Flow Sheet IV. Starting with the appropriate aldehyde, condensation with l tri n butylstannyl propane 2 one affords a hydroxy ketone which can be converted to the target lactones either by a acylation with 2 bromoacetyl bromide followed by intramolecular Reformatsky cyclization or b acylation with acetyl chloride followed by intermolecular Reformatsky reaction with ethyl 2 bromoacetate followed by lactonization of the dihydroxy ester. Separation of the cis and trans racemic lactones and the subsequent resolution of the trans racemate to obtain the 4 R enantiomer are carried out as described in Flow Sheet I. Flow Sheet V shows the details of the synthesis of benzaldehyde having an ortho phenyl group, followed by their use in the general scheme of Flow Sheet I to form compounds of this invention.This Flow Sheet summarizes the use of the benz aIde hydes so made in the synthesis of vinylene bridged compounds as in Flow Sheet I, but they obviously can also be used as described in Flow Sheet III to produce compounds with other bridging groups.Because of the extremely high potency of the pyranones having a 6 phenyl phenyl group, these compounds, pre pared as in Flow Sheet V, are especially to be pre ferred. Flow Sheet VI shows an alternate preparation of the 6 phenyl substituted benzaldehydes IIIa. The imines formed between aniline and substituted benzaldehydes are treated with palladium II acetate to give stable complexes. These complexes are reacted with substituted phenyl Grignard reagents in the presence of triphenylphosphine to give, after acidic hydrolysis, the 6 phenyl substituted benzaldehydes lIla.

REACTIONS IN FLOW SHEETS I VI 1. When R1, R2 or R3 is HO or bears a hydroxyl substituent, the HO group is etherified using a reagent R4X in a suitable solvent such asDMF and the like in the presence of a suitable base, preferably an alkali metal carbonate such as K2CO3, to give the corresponding ether R4O which can be carried through the remainder of the synthesis. If it is desired to remove R4 at a later synthetic step,R4 is chosen as an easily removable group such as CH3OCH2CH2OCH2 the MEM protecting group . The MEM group is removed readily by treatment with a Lewis acid catalyst such as ZnBr2 in a suitable solvent such as CH2C12 and the like. When the starting material is devoid of a hydroxyl group, step 1 is omitted. 2. Aldol Reaction. This can be run in several ways a The classical Aldol synthesis in which acetaldehyde is condensed with the starting benzaldehyde1 the resulting hydroxyaldehyde is. acetylated with acetic anhydride and acetic acid is eliminated thermally to give the corresponding cinnamaldehyde. b The directed Aldol condensation in which the anion of an appropriately N substituted ethylidenylimine, such as ethylidenecyclohexylimine and the like, is condensed with the starting benzaldehyde at or below room temperature in an aprotic solvent, such as THF and the like, to afford a hydroxy ss phenyl propylidenylimine which, upon concomitant dehydration and imine hydrolysis in an acidic medium, such as dilute aqueous HC1, provides the corresponding cinnamal dehyde. c The use of a nucleophilic acetalde hyde equivalent in which cis 2 ethoxyvinylithium,gen erated from cis l ethoxy 2 tri n butylstannylethylene, is condensed with the starting benzaldehyde to give an allylic alcohol which is subsequently rearranged, under suitable acidic conditions, to the corresponding cinnamaldehyde. 3 Dianion Step. Reaction with the dianion of acetoacetic ester in a suitable aprotic solvent such as THP , dioxane and the like. 4 Reduction with NaBH4 in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol and the like at or below room temperature. 5 tactonization. Saponification by base e.g. NaOH in aqueous alcohol followed by acidification and cyclodehydration by heating in toluene.NOTE Steps 3, 4 and 5 are usually carried out sequentially without purification of compounds V and VI. 6 Separation of the cis and trans race mic mixtures by chromatography on silica gel or crystallization. 7 Resolution of the trans racemate into its enantiomers by treating the trans lactone with either d or 1 alpha a methylbenzylamine to give the diastereomeric dihydroxy amides which are separated by chromatography or crystallization.Hydrolysis of each pure diastereomeric amide under basic conditions, such as ethanolic NaOH and the like, affords the corresponding enantiomerically pure dihydroxy acid which, upon lactonization, e.g., in refluxing toluene, provides the pure trans or trans enantiomer. Stereochemistry depends on the absolute stereochemistry of the diastereomeric amide from which it is derived. 8 Saponification with M OH where is an alkali metal cation. 9 Careful acidification. 10 Mild hydrolysis 11 Nucleophilic opening of the lactone ring with an alcohol, R5OH, in the presence either of a basic catalyst, particularly the corresponding alkoxide, R5O, or an acidic catalyst such as an acidic ion exchange resin, e.g. Amberlite 120. 12 Hydrogenation in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as Rhodium or Palladium on carbon. 13 Reaction with NaCN in a suitable solvent such as aqueous ethanol and the like. 14 Reduction with DIBAH in a aprotic solvent such as toluene, ether, THF and the like followed by work up with an aqueous acid such as 5 H2SO4. 15 Aldol condensation with l tri n butyl s,tannyl propan 2 one. 16 Acylation with 2 bromoacetyl bromide. 17 Intramolecular Reformatsky reaction carried out, for example, in the presence of activated zinc dust, cuprous bromide and diethylaluminum chloride. 18 Acylation with acetyl chloride. 19 Intermolecular Reformatsky reaction carried out with ethyl 2 bromacetate, for example, in the presence of the reagents indicated in step 17 above. 20 Treatment with N bromosuccinimide in CC14 with irradiation by a sun lamp TetrahedronLetters, 3809 1979 . 21 Treatment with two equivalents of the amine EMI23.1 22 Reaction with SOC12 .J.

A further aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition consisting of at least one of the compounds of formula I in association with a pharmaceutical vehicle or diluent. The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated in a classical manner utilizing solid or liquid vehicles or diluents and pharmaceutical additives of a type appropriate to the mode of desired administration.The compounds can be administered by an oral route, for example, in the form of tablets, capsules, granules or powders, or they can be administered by a parenteral route in the form of injectable preparations. The dose to be administered depends on the unitary dose, the symptoms, and the age and the body weight of the patient. A dose for adults is preferably between 200 and 2,000 mg per day, which can be administered in a single dose or in the form of individual doses from 1 4 times per day. A typical capsule for oral administration contains active ingredient 250 mg , lactose 75 mg and magnesium stearate 15 mg . The mixture is passed through a 60 mesh sieve and packed into a No. 1 gelatin capsule. A typical injectible preparation is produced by asceptically placing 250 mg of sterile active ingredient into a vial, asceptically freezedrying and sealing. For use, the contents of the vial are mixed with 2 ml of physiological saline, to produce an injectible preparation. The compounds of this invention also have useful antifungal activities. For example, they may be used to control strains of Penicillium sp.,Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Cochliobolus miyabeorus and Hilminthosporium cynodnotis. For those utilities they are admixed with suitable formulating agents, powders, emulsifying agents or solvents such as aqueous ethanol and sprayed or dusted on the plants to be protected. This invention can be illustrated by the following examples in which ratios of solvents are in volumes and percentages, unless otherwise indicated, or by weight.
