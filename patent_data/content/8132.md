# Resistor and or conductor composition including an organic vehicle.

## Abstract
Vehicles useful for thick film resistors fireable in non oxidizing atmosphere, which are based on copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate, are provided. Pastes based on such vehicles, hexaboride conductors, and nonreducible glasses have high viscosity, good printability, and have no carbonaceous reside upon firing.
