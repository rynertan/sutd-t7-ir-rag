# Improved homogeneous binding assay method and reagent system, test kit and test device therefor.

## Abstract
An improved homogenous binding assay for determin ing polyvalent analytes employing labeled binding partners for the analyte, such as labeled antibodies. Binding of the labeled binding partner to analyte results in a change in the response from the label due to steric hindrance of access to the label by a member of a reagent detection system which generates the response by interaction with the label. The improvement comprises adding to the system a macromole cular binder selective for binding to analyte, e.g., anti analyte, whereby the resulting steric hindrance is enhanced.

## Description
IMPROVED HOMOGENEOUS BINDING ASSAY METHOD ANDREAGENT SYSTEM, TEST KIT AND TEST DEVICE THEREFORE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 2. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The development of specific binding assay techniques has provided extremely useful analytical methods for determining various organic substances of diagnostic, medical, environmental and industrial importance which appear in liquid mediums at very low concentrations. Specific binding assays are based on the interaction between the substance under determination, herein referred to as analyte, and a binding partner thereof. Where one of the analyte and its binding partner is an antibody and the other is a corresponding hapten or antigen, the assay is known as an immunoassay.Other binding interactions between the analyte and a binding partner serve as the basis of binding assays, including the binding interactions between hormones, vitamins, metabolites, and pharma ecological agents, and their respective rectors and binding substances. The first binding assay to be developed was the radioimmunoassay which employs a radioactive isotope as the label. Because of the inconvenience and diffi culty of handling radioactive materials, assay systems have been devised using materials other than radioisotopes as the label component, including enzyme cofactors, enzyme substrates, enzyme modulators, e.g., activators and inhibitors, cycling reactants, spin radicals, enzymes, bacteriophages, metals and organometallic complexes, organic and inorganic catalysts, prosthetic groups, chemiluminescent reactants, and fluorescent molecules. In a binding assay for determining an analyte in a test sample, the sample is combined with a reagent system which includes a labeled conjugate which becomes partitioned between a bound form, the bound species, and its unbound form, the free species, depending upon the amount of analyte present. Where the labeled conjugate in the bound species is essentially indistinguishable in the presence of the labeled conjugate in the free species by the means used to monitor the label, as in the case of radioimmunoassay, the bound species and the free species must be physically separated in order to complete the assay. This type of assay is referred to in the art as heterogeneous . Where the bound species and free species forms of the labeled conjugate can be distinguished in the presence of each other, a homogeneous format can be followed and the separation step avoided. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Many different assay formats can be devised for carrying out homogeneous binding assays Commonly, a competitive binding format is followed wherein a labeled form of the analyte, or of an analog thereof, competes with the analyte from the test sample for binding to a binding partner of the analyte, e.g., antibody. In certain applications, however, a great advantage is offered by a direct binding format wherein a labeled binding partner is used, any analyte in the sample binding directly to the labeled material to cause a measurable change in the label response. Nonetheless, the use of labeled binding partners in homo geneous binding assay has been very limited. Representative of the art are U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,233,402 3,996,345 4,287,300 4,208,479 and 4,256,834 Litman et aZ, AnaZ.Biochem. 106 223 1980 Ullman et aZ, J. BioZ. Chem. 251 4172 1976 Wei and Rube, CZin.Chem. 23 1386 1977 and Gibbons et aZ, Coin. Chem. 27 1602 1981 . A particularly unique and advantageous homogeneous binding assay employing a labeled binding partner is described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No.359,610, filed March 18, 1982, and assigned to the instant assignee. In one aspect, this assay system employs a single labeled monoclonal antibody reagent.A test sample suspected to contain the analyte of interest is combined with a labeled monoclonal antibody preparation in which antibody to the analyte is substantially the only labeled component. The label employed is selected such that a detectable response is measurably different in a qualitative or quantitative sense when the labeled antibody is bound to the analyte compared to when not so bound. The resulting detectable response is therefore a function of the analyte in the test sample. As the analyte concentration increases, there is increased binding of labeled antibody and thus increased modulation of the detectable response of the label. U.S. Patent No. 4,281,061 describes a homogeneous immunoassay based on competitive binding between analyte and labeled analyte for a binding partner and which employs anti binding partner for the purpose of enhancing sensitivity. Coin. Chern. 27 1797 1981 is a general review of the application of monoclonal antibodies in clinical immunology. German OLS 3,006,709 and 3,006,710 describe homogeneous immunoassays based on competitive binding between analyte and labeled analyte for a binding partner. The label employed is an enzyme modulator, e.g., inhibitor, and one of the binding partner, the modulator label or the enzyme that is modulated is sterically enlarged such as by binding of antibody. SUMbIARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an improved homogeneous binding assay method for determining an analyte in a test sample employing a labeled binding partner of the analyte. The test sample is combined with the labeled binding partner, e.g., labeled anti analyte, and a reagent detection system for the label comprised in the labeled binding partner, the label interacting with a member of the detection system to provide a response which is measurably different when the labeled binding partner is bound to the analyte compared to when not so bound due to steric hindrance of access of the detection system member to the label. The resulting response is a function of the presence or amount of the analyte in the test sample. The improvement provided by the present invention comprises additionally combining the test sample with a macromolecular binder selective for binding to the analyte, but which does not bind significantly to the labeled binding partner, whereby the steric hindrance is specifically enhanced. In the reaction medium, the auxiliary binder will become bound to analyte labeled binding partner complex, increasing the steric bulk of this bound species of the labeled binding part ncr and thereby providing increased steric blockage or impairment of the interaction of the label with the reagent detection system. The auxiliary binder may be any substance of significant size which will bind the analyte but not the labeled binding partner. Preferably the auxiliary binder will be a binding protein such as an antibody or a fragment or aggregate thereof.Also, the label preferably is a participant in an enzyme catalyzed reaction such as an enzyme substrate, a coenzyme, an enzyme prosthetic group, an enzyme inhibitor, or an enzyme itself. The present improvement is particularly applicable to homogeneous binding assays for polyvalent analytes, which are analytes of substantial size, usually larger than 10,000 daltons in molecular weight, that can accomodate simultaneous binding of the labeled binding partner and the auxiliary binder. A principal advantage of the present invention is that the degree of modulation of the label response upon binding of analyte with the labeled binding partner can be substantially increased by the presence of the auxiliary binder for the analyte, thereby significantly increasing the sensitivity of the assay. The present invention also provides improved reagent systems and test kits for carrying out the binding assay method. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The drawing is a graphical representation of data presented in the examples which follow demonstrating the enhanced signal modulation by the additIon of the auxiliary binder, which in the example used is unlabeled anti analyte. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMEw In the context of this disclosure, the following terms shall be defined as follows unless otherwise indicated Analyte the compound, or class of related compounds, whose presence or amount in a test sample is under determination. Binding partner of the analyte any substance, or class of substances, which has a specific binding affinity for the analyte. Homogeneous binding assay an assay based on the specific binding between analyte and its binding partner in which the label response is measured without physical separation of the bound labeled species from the free labeled species. Reagent system a composition, test device or apparatus, test kit, or other physical arrangement, means, or combination of re agents for use in performing the present assay. The aforementioned U. S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. 359,610 is hereby expressly incorporated by reference into this application. ANALYTE The present invention can be applied to the assay of any analyte for which a binding partner is available or can be prepared. In most cases, the analgte is a polypeptide, protein, carbohydrate, glycoprotein, or other organic molecule of sufficient size to allow the binding of both the labeled binding partner and the auxiliary binder to a single analyte molecule. Usually, the analyte is an immunologically active polypeptide or protein, usually having a molecular weight of between about 10,000 and about 10,000,000, such as an antibody or antigenic polypeptide or protein. The present invention is particularly advantageous as applied to the determination of relatively high molecular weight materials in the classes of polypeptides, proteins, polysaccharides, polynucleic acids and the like.A particular advantage is gained where the analyte is an especially scarce material as is the case with many high molecular weight constituents of test samples of analytical interest, e.g., biological samples such as serum, plasma, whole blood, urine, and saliva. The analyte will be polyvalent, that is, able to bind both the labeled binding partner and the auxiliary binder, and will usually have a molecular weight greater than about 10,000, and oftentimes greater than about 100,000. Representative polypeptide analytes are angiotensin I and II, C peptide, oxytocin, vasopressin, neurophysin, gastrin, secretin, bradykinin, and glucagon. Representative protein analytes include the classes of protamines, mucoproteins, glycoproteins, globulins, albumins, scleroproteins, phosphoproteins, histones, lipoproteins, chromoproteins, and nucleoproteins. Examples of specific proteins are prealbumin, al lipoprotein, human serum albumin, a1 glycoprotein, transcortin, thyroxine binding globulin, haptoglobin, hemoglobin, myoglobin, ceruloplasmin, a2 lipoprotein, a 2 macro globulin, B lipoprotein, erythropoietin, transferin, hemopexin, fibrinogen, the immunoglobulins such as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, and their frag Tents, e.g., Fcand Fab, complement factors, prolactin, blood clotting factors such as fibrinogen, thrombin and so forth, insulin, melanotropin, somatotropin, thyrotropin, follicle stimulating hormone, leutinizing hormone, chorionic gonadotropin, thyroid stimulating hormone, placental lactogen, intrinsic factor, transcobalamin, serum enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, amylase, lipase, phosphatases, cholinesterase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, and uropepsin, endorphins, enkephalins, protamine, tissue antigens, bacterial antigens, and viral antigens such as hepatitis associated antigens e.g., HBsAg, HBCAg and HBeAg . LABELED BINDING PARTNER This component is a conjugate of a binding partner for the analyte and a steric sensitive label. The binding partner component can be selected from materials which have a specific binding affinity for the analyte. In most cases, the binding partner will be a macromolecule which binds to the analyte in a noncovalent, essentially reversible manner. Involved in such binding between analyte and the binding partner will be hydrogen and ionic bonding, van der Waals forces, and dipole dipole interactions. Other bonding forces may also be involved, including in certain instances covalent bonding. The analyte and binding partner form specific binding pairs, with the analyte being either one of the pair and the binding partner being the other.Such binding pairs include the following groups antigens haptens and antibodies thereto lectins and carbohydrates complementary polynucleic acids, e.g., RNA and DNA hormones, vitamins, metabolites and drugs, and their binding counterparts or receptors, usually binding proteins enzymes and their interactive components, e.g., substrates, coenzymes, and inhibitors. ost commonly, the binding partner will be an anti analyte, i.e., an immunologically derived binding substance specific or selective for binding the analyte. Thus, the anti analyte can comprise whole antibodies raised against the analyte, or fragments or aggregates of such antibodies. When in the form of whole antibody, anti analyte can belong to any of the classes and subclasses of known immunoglobulins, e.g.,IgG, IgM, IgE, and so forth. Any fragment of any such antibody which retains specific binding affinity for analyte can also be employed, for instance, the fragments of IgG conventionally known as Fab, F ab , andF ab 2. In addition, aggregates, polymers, and conjugates of immunoglobulins or their fragments can be used where appropriate. Such poly anti analyte can be prepared in any available manner so as to maintain binding affinity for analyte.Other forms of antianalyte can be employed so long as the material selected has a specific binding affinity for the analyte concerned. The immunoglobulin source for the anti analyte can be obtained in any available manner. Usually, anti analyte immunoglobulin will be obtained by conventional antiserum techniques or monoclonal techniques. Antiserum containing anti analyte is obtained by well established techniques involving immunization of an animal, such as a rabbit, guinea pig, or goat, with an appropriate immunogen. State of the art reviews are provided by Parker, Radioimmunoassay of Bio logically Active Compounds, Prentice Hall EnglewoodCliffs, New Jersey, U.S.A., 1976 , Butler, J. ImmunoZ. Meth. 7 1 24 1975 Weinryb and Shroff, Drug Metab.Rev. 10 271 283 1975 Broughton and Strong, CZin. 2hem. 22 726 732 1976 and Playfair et al, Br. ed. Bo . 30 24 31 1974 . Monoclonal anti analyte is preferably used as the binding partner in the labeled conjugate of the present invention for the reasons given in the aforementionedU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 359,610. Monoclonal antibodies are chemically homogeneous and are obtained by somatic cell hybridization techniques seeLymphocyte Hybridornas, ed. Melchers et al, Springer Verlag New York 1978 and Methods in EnzymoZogy 73 Part B 3 46 1981 . In general, monoclonal anti analyte immunoglobulin is produced by fusing lymphocytes which produce such antibody with myeloma cells to form hybridomas, isolating a hybridoma clone which secretes the desired antibody, and harvesting the secreted monoclonal antibody.The lymphocytes involved in hybridization are commonly spleen cells removed from an animal such as a mouse or a rat which has been immunized in the conventional manner against the analyte. The label to which the binding partner is conjugated or linked can be any substance which interacts with another molecule or molecules a member of the reagent detection system to give a detectable response, where such interaction is sterically sensitive, that is where binding of analyte to the labeled binding partner sterically hinders the response producing interaction.The mass of the labeled conjugate will be selected to be significantly increased upon binding of the analyte.Generally, as the mass of the analyte becomes relatively larger, the steric effects in the environment of the label become more pronounced. The label itself will preferably be small, e.g., of molecular weight less than 50,000, generally less than 10,000, more usually less than 4,000, and preferably less than 2,000, and the detection system member or members with which it interacts will preferably be significantly larger, e.g., more than 3 times larger, more usually 10 times larger, and preferably 20 to 100 times or more larger than the label. Accordingly, in the most preferable systems with labels having masses of the order of 100 to 2,000 daltons, at least one member of the detection system with which the label must interact to provide the detectable signal ws Y the order of 10,000 to 200,000 daltons or greater.Such size relationship between the label and the detection system member increases the probability of a significant steric effect upon binding of analyte with the labeled binding partner. Preferred labels therefore are participants in an enzyme catalyzed reaction, such as enzyme substrates, coenzymes, enzyme prosthetic groups, and enzyme inhibitors, since a wide variety of enzymic reactions are available from which to choose assay components. Many small substrates, coenzymes, and inhibitors are known for enzymes of sufficiently large molecular weight to have the preferred size relationship between label and its interacting detection system member. This applies likewise for prosthetic groups and their corresponding apoenzymes.Similarly, many enzymes are known which have significantly larger substrates or for which artificially large substrates, coenzymes, or inhibitors can be prepared by coupling small substrates, coenzymes, and inhibitors to high molecular weight backbone materials such as water soluble polymers. Specifically preferred labels are those described in detail in the aforementioned U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. 359,610, and briefly include enzyme substrate and coenzyme labels, U.S. Pat. No. 4,279,992 andU.K. Pat. Spec. 1,552,607 enzyme prosthetic group labels, U.S. Pat. No. 4,238,565 enzyme modulator e.g.inhibitor labels, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,134,792 and 4,273,866 enzyme labels, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,817,837 and 4,043,872 chemically excited fluorescent labels,U.S. Pat. No. 4,238,195 and epitope labels, U.S. Pat.Nos. 3,935,074 and 3,998,943. The selected label is chemically joined to the binding partner to form the labeled binding partner component of the present invention. A wide varicty of means for linking the two elements are available and known in the art. The linkage can involve a chemical bond or a chain comprising from 1 to 50 atoms, more commonly 1 to 30 atoms, and usually 1 to 20 atoms, excluding hydrogen, principally composed of carbon and heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur. Conventional linking groups are described at length in the literature. See for exampleU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,230,797 4,279,992 3,817,837 3,935,074 and 3,996,345.The linking group can be comprised of a side arm group put on the label for the purposes of spacing and or functionalizing the label for coupling to the binding partner and or the residue from a bifunctional coupling agent used in linking th label or derivatized label to the binding partner. The steric effects of the binding of analyte and the binding partner are also enhanced by selecting binding partners having masses that will be significantly increased by complexation with analyte. In general, te binding partner preferably will be smaller than 10 times the mass of the analyte, more usually smaller than the absolute mass of the analyte, and more preferably smaller than 0.25 the mass of the analyte.Where anti analyte is used, the mass of the binding partner can be decreased by selecting antibodies of an immunoglobulin class which have low molecular weights, e.g., IgG antibodies have molecular weights around 150,000 whereas those of the IgM class have molecular weights around 900,000. Also, one can selectively cleave antibodies to give fragments of lower molecular weight which retain their specific binding affinity for analyte, e.g., various fragments of IgG antibodies can be prepared such as Fab 50,000 daltons , F ab 53,000 daltons , and F ab 2 106,000 daltons . AUXILIARY BINDER Any macromolecule which selectively binds the analyte can be used as the auxiliary binder in the present invention. By macromolecule is intended a polymeric molecule of natural or synthetic origin having a molecular weight greater than about 5000, usually greater than 10,000, preferably greater than about 40,000, and often greater than 100,000. By selective binding is intended that the auxiliary binder will bind significantly with the analyte, and perhaps other materials present in the reaction mixture, but not labeled binding partner. Normally, the auxiliary binder will be an unlabeled binding partner for tie analyte as defined above, and therefore, in the usual case will be a binding protein e.g., antibody, lectin, receptor protein, and the like.Preferably, the auxiliary binder will be an anti analyte, e.g., an antibody or a fragment or aggregate thereof. When used as the auxiliary binder, anti analyte may be polyclonal obtained by conventional antiserum techniques or monoclonal. Of course, the auxiliary binder may be a binding protein other than anti analyte in appropriate circumstances. For instance, the analyte may be a particular carbohydrate or a class of carbohydrates and one can use a labeled antibody as the labeled binding partner and a lectin as the auxiliary binder. In another case, the analyte may be IgG and one can use a labeled antibody other than of the IgG class or a labeled IgG fragment and as auxiliary binder is used protein A a protein known in the literature to bind to the tic portion of IgG . Other situations in which various nonantibody binding proteins can be used as the auxiliary binder will be evident to one working in the field. It is preferred that the auxiliary binder and the labeled binding partner compete minimally for binding to analyte. In the most preferred embodiment, analyte can freely accomodate binding of both labeled binding partner and auxiliary binder in order that substantially all analyte labeled binding partner complexes that are formed in the assay system become bound by the auxiliary binder to enhance steric hindrance of access of the detection system member which interacts with the label. Therefore, the auxiliary binder and the binding partner which is labeled are preferably not identical. Where the binding partner is monoclonal anti analyte as is preferred and the auxiliary binder is polyclonal anti analyte, the test sample is preferably first contacted with the labeled monoclonal anti analyte for a period of time and then the unlabeled polyclonal anti analyte added.In this way, competition between the labeled binding partner and the auxiliary binder for binding to the analyte is minimized. Where both the binding partner and the auxiliary binder are monoclonal anti analyte, they are preferrably selected to bind to different determinant sites on the analyte and may be added simultaneously. Auxiliary binders other than naturally occurring binding proteins can be used provided that they do not bind substantially to the labeled binding partner to avoid modulation of the label response due to steric effects unrelated to the presence of analyte. For example, where the analyte itself is a binding protein, the labeled binding partner can be an antibody to the binding protein analyte and the auxiliary binder can be a corresponding macromolecular material which the binding protein analyte binds, e.g., the material which it binds in nature if such material is macromolecular in size or the material in a form that renders it macromolecular such as a polymerized form or as the material coupled to a macromolecular support or polymer. Such a situation is presented where the analyte is thyroxine binding globulin TBG .In the assay one would use labeled anti TBG and, as the auxiliary binder, thyroxine T 4 or triiodothyronine T 3 coupled to a polymer support. Another such situation is an assay for the binding protein avidin. Here, one would use labeled anti avidin and, as the auxiliary binder, a biotin polymer conjugate. Yet another example is the assay for the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase DFR in which labeled anti DFR is used with a methrotrexate polymer conjugate as the auxiliary binder. In addition, the present invention is applicable to the assay of analytes other than binding proteins using auxiliary binders which likewise are not binding proteins. For instance, a lectin can be the analyte with labeled anti lectin being the labeled binding partner and a carbohydrate which binds to the lectin being the auxiliary binder. Also, a histone can be the analyte with labeled anti histone being the labeled binding partner and a polynucleic acid, e.g., DNA, which binds the the histone being the auxiliary binder. Even further, concanavalin A can be determined using a labeled antibody and, as the auxiliary binder, dextran.One could also assay for a clotting factor via, IXa,Xa, XIa, XI Ia, or Kallikrein using a labeled form of the plasma serum protease inhibitor conventionally referred to as antithrombin III and, as the auxiliary binder, heparin a sulfated proteoglycan of molecular weight around 10,000 . The auxiliary binder need not be specific for the analyte, that is, it can bind to other materials in the reaction mixture, provided that it does not bind significantly to labeled binding partner or otherwise nonspecifically modulate the label response. REACTION MIXTURE AND CONDITIONS The test sample to be assayed can be a naturally occurring or artificially formed liquid suspected to contain the analyte, and usually is a biological fluid or a dilution thereof. Biological fluids that can be assayed include serum, plasma, urine, saliva, milk, and amniotic and cerebrospinal fluids. The binding reaction will in almost all cases be allowed to proceed under mild conditions. The reaction mixture will be in general an aqueous medium with any desirable organic cosolvents being present in minor amounts. The temperature of the reaction will be maintained at a constant level in normal ci. cumstances throughout the incubation period and the measurement step. Temperatures will generally be between 5 and 500C, more usually between 20 and 40 C. Preferably, the reaction will proceed at room temperature. The pH of the reaction mixture will vary between 5 and 10, more usually between 6 and 9. The concentration of various reagents will depend on the level of analyte expected in the test medium, with such level 3 usually being between 10 3 and 10 12N1 As in the case of the previously described reaction parameters, selection is primarily based on empirically derived optimization balanced against the preferences and needs of the technician who will ultimately perform assays on a routine basis. None of the parameters therefore is of a critical nature to the present invention, rather they are all within the ordinary skill in the art. D jT SYSTEM The reagent system, i.e., reagent combination or means, of the present invention comprises all of the essential chemical elements required to conduct a desired assay method encompassed by the present invention. The reagent system is presented in a commercially packaged form, as a composition or admixture where the compatibility of the reagents will allow, in a test device configuration, or as a test kit, i.e., a packaged combination of one or more containers holding the necessary reagents. The reagent system comprises the reagents appropriate for the binding reaction system desired including the labeled binding partner, the auxiliary binder, and any necessary reagents for the label detection system, all as defined hereinbefore.Such binding reaction reagents can include in addition any other optional reagents for performing the particular assay technique involved. Of course, the reagent system can include other reagents as are known in the art and which may be desirable from a commercial and user standpoint , such as buffers, diluents, standards, and so forth. A particularly preferred test kit comprises 1 a labeled monoclonal anti analyte preparation in which the monoclonal anti analyte is substantially the only labeled component, 2 an appropriate reagent detection system for the label employed as described herein, and 3 unlabeled anti analyte as the auxiliary binder. Also preferred is a test device comprising the reagent system and a solid carrier member incorporated therewith. The various forms of such test device are described inU.S. patent application Serial No. 202,378, filed October 30, 1980, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Next, each cuvette received 25 uL of labeled monoclonal antibody from PartB above 8.6 mM FAD in 0.1 N sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 bovine serum albumin. Then each cuvette received 16 pL of goat antibody to glucose oxidase. Aliquots 25 L of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pli 7.0, 0.1 bovine serum albumin, containing various levels of human IgG were added to the appropriate cuvettes.The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 C for 30 minutes and then an aliquot 2 or 10 L of unlabeled polyclonal antibody to human IgG Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Hicksvill New York USA was added to the appropriate cuvettes.The reaction mixtures were incubated at 250C for an additional 30 minutes and then 50 uL of apoglucose oxidase 8 uM FAD binding sites, see U.S. Pat. No.4,268,631 in 0.1 N sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 glycerol, 8 zit 4 amino antipyrine and 0.02 W V sodium azide. The complete reaction mixtures were incubated at 250C for 30 minutes and then their absorbances at 520 nm were recorded. The results are shown in the table below.

When unlabeled polyclonal anti human IgG was present, color generation also varied inversely with the level of human IgG present. However, whereas in the absence of unlabeled antibody color generation was inhibited to about 70 of that in the absence of analyte at the highest human IgG concentration, in the presence of 10 uL of unlabeled antibody color generation was inhibited to 508 compared to the zero level concentration for the analyte. This effect is dramatically illustrated by the graphical representation in the drawing comparing the inhibition curves in the absence of unlabeled antibody and in the presence of 10 uL of unlabeled antibody.The increased inhibition of the label response in the presence of the auxiliary binder provides a significantly more sensitive assay.
