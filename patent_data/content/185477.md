# Production of ether ether alcohol compositions.

## Abstract
Ether ether alcohol rich compositions are produced by hydrogenating hydroformylation reaction products, separat ing an ether ether alcohol containing mixture from the hydrogenation product, and catalytically hydrogenating such mixture at 200 250 C and 30 100 atmospheres. The crude product is then reflux distilled to separate the ether ether alcohol rich compositions from lighter and heavier ends.
