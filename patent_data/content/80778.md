# A method and a device for correcting the cuff pressure in measuring the blood pressure in a part of the body by means of a plethysmograph.

## Abstract
A method and a device for correcting the cuff pressure 5a in the indirect, non invasive and continuous measure ment of the blood pressure in a part of the body by using a plethysmograph in a fluid filled pressure cuff 1 , a electronic control circuit, and an electric pressure valve 10 . The cuff pressure is controlled by the plethysmographic signal 5b in closed loop operation with the aid of a servo reference level obtained via a memory circuit. Said servo reference level, in operation of the device, is adjusted by opening the closed loop of the control circuit for a short interval, after which, in open loop operation the cuff pressure is adjusted at an intermediate pressure derived from the pressure last mea sured and the servo reference level is adjusted via the memory circuit 75 .
