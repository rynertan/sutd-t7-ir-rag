# Olefin polymer compositions containing silicone additives and the use thereof in the production of film material.

## Abstract
Olefin polymer compositions containing silicone addi tives which can be extruded through relatively narrow die gaps at commercial extrusion rates to provide film material characterized by improved mechanical and optical proper ties. The silicone additives have the formula
