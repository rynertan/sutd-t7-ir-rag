# OPERATIONAL AMPFLIFIER

## Abstract
An operational amplifier comprises an initial amplifier stage having a pair of inputs, and a second amplifier stage connected to an output of the initial stage. A phase compensating capacitive element is connected between an output terminal of the second stage and a virtual ground point, and a constant current source is connected to the virtual ground point and the output of the initial stage. A resistive element and a capacitive element are series connected between the output of the initial stage and the output of the second stage.
