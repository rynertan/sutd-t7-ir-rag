# Semiconductor laser device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser device has at least a laminated region of first and second outer layers 2, 4 and an inner, active layer 3 on a semiconductor substrate 1 . At least the first inner layer is bent in the proximity of the light emitting facets 8, 9 . To avoid catastrophic degradation of the facets and achieve high output, a second inner layer 11 of refractive index intermediate that of the first inner layer and that of the outer layers is provided and is also bent so that the laser light generated inside the active layer 3 in the proximity of the facets generates optical coupling in the second inner layer 11 and is emitted from the crystal facets of the second inner layer 11 . A blocking layer 10 may be provided.
