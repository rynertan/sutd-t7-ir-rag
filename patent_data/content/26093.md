# Oil in water monitor.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a measurement cell 1 suitable for monitoring the oil content of water oil mixtures by measuring the attenuation of radiation incident upon a falling stream 10 of the mixture. The inventive feature lies in adapting the cell interior to enable provision of a gaseous curtain between the radiation source 14 and the falling stream 10 on the one hand and between the falling stream 10 and a detector 15 of attenu ated radiation on the other hand. The provision of a gaseous curtain prevents window fouling at the radiation source and the detector thereby improving the accuracy of the measure ment.

## Description
OIL IN WATER MONITOR The present invention relates to a measurement cell suitable for monitoring the oil content of oil in water mixtures, especially mixtures encountered during the deballasting of oil tankers. During deballasting, it is necessary to establish the amount of oil in the water being discharged to ensure that the mixture is channelled to the appropriate destination according to its oil content, hence minimising pollution hazards which may result by discharge of oil into the sea. Processes utilising the difference in optical properties of the liquids have been used to monitor the amount of oil present in an oil in water mixture, but have given variable and inaccurate results since the responses obtained by such devices are subject to the effects of scattered lights resulting from the cell geometry and from cell window fouling. It has now been found that these effects, particularly the effects of cell window fouling, may be reduced by a novel cell design. Accordingly, the present invention is a device for monitoring the oil content of an oil in water mixture comprising a cell having a liquid inlet means adapted to produce a falling non turbulent liquid stream across the cell, b means for detecting the attenuation of incident radiation by the liquid comprising a source of electromagnetic radiation adapted to produce a beam of radiation passing through the liquid stream substantially at right angles, and a detector adapted to receive the attenuated radiation and to provide a signal proportional to the intensity of the radiation, c gas flow means for providing a gaseous curtain between the radiation source and the liquid stream and betwecn the detector and the liquid stream, the gaseous curtain being a current of gas flowing substantially parallel to but spaced from the liquid stream to prevent distortion of the latter, and d gas liquid outlet means. The cell and its component parts are suitably made of metal or plastics material which do not allow ingress of unwanted scattered radiation and which are not adversely affected by the liquid flowing through the cell under ambient conditions. The liquid inlet means are suitably shipped so as to produce a falling non turbulent liquid stream across the cell. The form of the liquid stream is preferably cylindrical, but the liquid inlet mean. may be suitably shaped so as to produce a liquid stream in other forms for instance as a film provided that non turbulent flow is mdintained. The liquid inlet means may be in the form of detachable units so as to provide a variety of dimensions of the inlet for use over a wide.range of oil concentrations it is important that the liquid mixture entering the cell during operation of the monitor is entirely homogeneous.The liquid mixture will normally be fed to the cell by means of a delivery pump and the pump is suitably connected to the liquid inlet means via a flow controller. The delivery pump, homogeniser and flow controller may be integral with the cell or detachable. The liquid outlet means is suitably an elongated extension of the lower part of the cell which channels the falling liquid stream into a drain or other similar means of discharge. The means for detecting the attenuation of incident radiation by the liquid comprises a radiation source and a detector which are suitably positioned so that the beam of radiation passes through the liquid stream at a point close to the liquij inlet means where the failing liquid stream is substantially free from turbulence.The electro magnetic radiation may be visible white or mono chromatic light of any wave length, ultra violet light or infra red radiation and may be polarised or unpolarised during its passage from the source to the detector. Preferably the radiation source is one which produces white or mono chromatic light. The detector may be a conventional photo electric cell. The light from the radiation source is suitably projected and the attenuated light received by the detector by means of fibre optic light guides.These light guides may be housed in enclosures in the cell walls which form windows in open communication with the cell interior.The windows may however be covered with transparent material such as glass or transparent polymer, and in this case the window covering preferably has a flat or hemispherical surface adjacent to the light guide and a substantially hemispherical surface adjacent to the interior of the cell so that the window covering forms a convex lens for the light emerging from and being received by the fibre optic light guides. The use of a gaseous curtain in the device of the present invention, however, enables the cell to function efficiently and continuously with or without such window coverings. The gas fl w means for providing a gaseous curtain suitably comprises an annular opening in the top of the cell surrounding the liquid inlet means and adapated to provide a cylindrical gaseous curtain concentric with and flowing in a direction substantially parallel to the falling liquid stream. Alternatively the gas flow means may comprise two openings in the top of the cell on either side of the liquid inlet means so as to provide two gaseous curtains on either side of the falling liquid stream and flowing in a direction substantially parallel to this to protect the radiation source on the one hand and the detector on the other hand. The flow of gas forming the gaseous curtain is spaced from the falling liquid stream, in order to prevent any distortion of this.The gas which in operation is pumped into the cell to provide the gaseous curtain is suitably inert not only with respect to the oil in water mixture but should also be non corrosive to the cell structure. Examples of suitable gases are air, nitrogen and argon. In a preferred embodiment of the device according to the present invention the cell interior below the cell windows is recessed to minimise any turbulence created by the gaseous curtain. The invention is further illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a view of the cell in vertical cross section. In the drawing, the cell housing 1 is provided with a liquid inlet pipe 2 which has a tapered exit 12 allowing a non turbulent flow of liquid to emerge therefrom. The inlet pipe is connected to a pump 9 through a homogeniser 8 and a flow controller 7.Surrounding the inlet pipe 2 is an annular gas inlet 3 which allows a current of gas to be admitted into the cell in the form of cylindrical curtain of gas surrounding te falling liquid stream.The cell housing 1 is provided neither side with apertures 4 and 5 for introducing electromagnetic radiation into and detecting attenuated radiation emerging from the cell by means of radiation source 14 and detector 15 respectively. The apertures 4 and 5 are positioned in a line substantially at right angles to and as close to the tapered exit 12 as possible. The radiation source 14 and the detecror 15 are provided with light guides 16 and 17 to direct the radiation into and from the cell. The lower half of the cell housing below the apertures is recessed at 11 to prevent distortion of the non turbulent liquid flow.In order to prevent ingress of dn stray radiation, the lower half of the cell is provided with shaped guards 6 which also assist in maintaining the gaseous currents substantially parallel to the falling liquid stream 10. The falling liquid stream 10 and the gaseous currents are led out of the cell through the outlet means 13. In operation, a current of air is admitted through the gas inlets 3 into the cell. The rate of flow of air into the cell is adjusted to that compatible with the desired flow rate of the oil in water mixture into the cellBefore admission of any liquid into the cell but with the current of air flowing through the cell a beam of light from the radiation source 14 is projected into the cell through aperture 4 by means of light guide 16. The attenuation, if any, by the current of air in the cell is detected by the detector 15 through aperture 5 by means o light guide 17 connected to detector 15. A similar reading is taken using a falling stream of pure water. These readings are used to calibrate the apparatus.The oil in water mixture under examination is the pumped by pump 9 via the homogeniser 8 and flow controller 7 into the inlet pipe 2. The variation in intensity of the light passing through the liquid mixture emerging from the exit 12 is detected as before using the detector 15. The output voltage of the detector 15 is fed into a logarithmic amplifier which will provide a linear relation between the output and contaminant oil concentration in the liquid mixture assuming that the particle size distribution of the contaminant remains constant over the range of concentrations. The principal advantages of this invention are that it allows continuous and efficient operation of the cell without fear of splashing of the radiation source or the detector enclosures and substantially reduces ageing due to oil mist coating of these enclosures. This is particularly important in cases where the oil concentration of the mixture is above 500 ppm. The present cell enables detection of oil concentrations up to 500 ppm accurately because the gaseous curtain keeps the radiation source and detector enclosures substantially clean.
