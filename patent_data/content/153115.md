# Method of and apparatus for forming a reinforced can end.

## Abstract
A method of forming a reinforced pressure resistant can end comprising the steps of taking a blank B , deforming it in a first deformation step to form a flanged cup shaped configu ration having a central portion CP , a radius, frusto conical wall, and annular flange and then deforming it a second time to offset the central portion CP and flange towards a common plane, to transform the radius into a reinforcing bead Rr , the two deformation steps being carried out using two pairs 26, 36 and 60, 80 of coaxial relatively movable metal forming tools at the same work station.
