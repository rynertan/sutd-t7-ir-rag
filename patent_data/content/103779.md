# REMOVING CONTAMINATES FROM A WELL FLUID AND WELL SYSTEM

## Abstract
An improved process for removing solid contaminates from a high density, salt type aqueous drilling completion packer fluid prior to its introduction into the well bore and for removing contaminates such as drilling mud and fluids from the well system prior to the introduction of brine to maintain the brine in a solids free state. To remove the solid contaminants, small effective amount of an alcohol and a suractant are added to the brine. After the solid contamin ates agglomerate, the solids are separated, leaving the brine in a substantially solids free state. To remove the contaminates from the well system, treated water is prepared with a surfactant and alcohol admixed in clean water. Without interrupting circulation, the treated water displaces the fluids and drilling mud within the well system. Circulation of the treated water continues until substantially all of the contaminates are carried in the circulated treated water. The treated water may be preceded or followed by another fluid which assists in removing the contaminates. The solids free brine is introduced into the well system to displace the treated water without exposure to the contaminates.
