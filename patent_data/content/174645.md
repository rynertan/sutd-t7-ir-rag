# SMOKING ARTICLE

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a smoking article which produces an aerosol that resembles tobacco smoke, but contains no more than a minimal amount of incomplete combustion or pyrolysis products. Preferred embodiments of the present smoking article comprise a short combustible carbonaceous fuel element, a heat stable substrate bearing an aerosol forming substance a heat conducting member which contacts a portion of the fuel element and the substrate, and an insulating jacket surrounding at least a portion of the fuel element. The smoking article of the present invention is capable of providing an aerosol smoke which is chemically simple, consisting essentially of air, oxides of carbon, water, and the aerosol which carries any desired flavorants or other desired volatile materials, and trace amounts of other materials. The aerosol smoke from the preferred embodiments has no significant mutagenic activity as measured by the Ames Test. In addition, the article may be made virtually ashless so that the user does not have to remove any ash during use.
