# Thin film magnetic heads.

## Abstract
To minimize the effect of overheating in a thin film magnetic head, deposited on a non magnetic substrate hav ing an air bearing surface normal to a deposition surface upon which two magnetic layers forming a magnetic yoke 11 are deposited with a transducing gap at the air bearing surface and a back closure 18 remote from the air bearing surface, a multi turn electrical conductive planar coil 20 , encircling the back closure 18 , has turns of generally curved shape without sharp corners, that portion of each turn in the transducing gap and back closure 18 being narrower than the adjacent por tions thereof. The turns progressively increase in width as the distance from the area increases and are of generally elliptical shape and constant separation.
