# Head load unload mechanism for rotating magnetic memories, particularly floppy disk drives.

## Abstract
A head load unload mechanism 12 for a rotating magnetic memory 11 , such as a single or double sided floppy disk drive, comprises a lifter arm 31 which is mounted for viscously damped rotation on a control arm 32 for selectively loading and unloading the read write head or heads 13, 14 of the drive 11 under the control of a snap action solenoid 33 . A pressure pad 82 may be mounted on the control arm 32 for movement into and out of pressure transmitting relationship with a recording medium 15 sup porting platen 83 under the control of the solonoid 33 whereby the recording medium 15 is flattened between the pressure pad 82 and the platen 83 when the head or heads 13, 14 are loaded to transfer data to or from the recording medium 15 .
