# INFORMATION RECORDING AND READOUT

## Abstract
A recording and readout information system having atomic scale densities comprises a recording medium hav ing a carrier 16 and means 20, 30 to form a pattern of atomic paticles 18A on the surface of the carrier. The atomic particles have an affinity for the carrier and can adhere to the surface to form a relatively adhesive and stable bond. The pattern of atomic particles produced on the carrier are representative of recorded information, e.g. binary repre sented information, of ultra high density based upon the size and spacing of such particles, which is in the range, for example, of 5Å .5 nm to 10Å 1 nm . A preferred embodi ment of the invention comprises a recording medium with an adsorbent carrier, and means to form a pattern of adsorbate atomic particles on the surface of the adsorbent carrier, the adsorbate atomic particles having an adsorptive affinity for the adsorbent carrier due at least in part to electrical attraction characteristics between the adsorbate atomic partiles and the adsorbent carrier. Readout means 30 , utilizing the tunnel current effect, is employed to determine the presence or absence of the atomic particles on the surface of the carrier and produce an electrical signal representative of the pattern of recorded information on the recording medium.
