# Polymeric compositions useful as binders in coating colours and coating colours prepared therefrom.

## Abstract
A coating color possessing desirable rheological and other properties is prepared from a binder composition comprising two polymeric components wherein one of said polymeric components is a lightly cross linked copolymer derived from an ester of an a,b ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, an a,b ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, an unsaturated carboxamide and, optionally, one or more other comonomers. Paper coating with the coating colors containing the binder composition exhibit high bind ing strengths and excellent printability.
