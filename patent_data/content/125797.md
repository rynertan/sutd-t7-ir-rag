# Interrupt signal handling apparatus.

## Abstract
To ensure security of interrupt input signals to a compu ter system 30 3N with minimum interruption of the running of programs in the system two interrupt logic units 1 receive interrupt signals on leads 20 2x from connected apparatus and store flags representing the interrupt signals in an inter rupt store 2 . Control logic 3 compares each input signal with presettable criteria to determine if such signal is an immediate interrupt signal and, if so, causes the data to be transferred by way of a read register 5 to the connected computer system 30 3N . At the same time the control logic 3 of one of the units 1 designated as the active unit also causes an output on a lead 11 to the other unit 1 designated as the standby unit. If the standby unit determines that an immediate interrupt has occurred and does not receive a signal on the lead 11 , its respective control logic 3 will cause the contents of its interrupt store 2 to be transferred to its respective read register 5 and will also cause an addi tional flag to be entered in the read register 5 indicating the failure of the active unit 1 . Designation of the two units 1 as active or standby is periodically changed by action of the computer system 30 3N .
