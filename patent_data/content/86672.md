# Expansion fastener.

## Abstract
The utility of an expansion fastener 10 including an exter nally thereaded shaft 12 having a head 14 shaped so as to be capable of being engaged by a manipulative tool, a generally cylindrical longitudinally split sleeve 26 located around the shaft, a nut 16 threaded on the shaft, the sleeve 26 and the nut 16 including coacting surfaces 20, 52 capable of expanding the sleeve 26 as the nut 16 is moved on the shaft 12 can be improved by utilising coacting structures 32, 38 on the end of the sleeve 26 remote from the head 14 and on the nut 16 for preventing relative rotation between the sleeve 26 and the nut 16 as the shaft 12 is turned. Prefer ably the sleeve 26 is twisted slightly in a spiral like manner so that an end portion 32 of the sleeve 26 serves as one of the coacting structures which engages an adjacent ridged or other not smooth surface 38 of the nut 16 serving as the other coacting structure. An edge 30 or an irregular sur face or both at the other end of the sleeve 26 can effectively be utilized to hold the sleeve 26 against rotation relative to a panel 30 of similar member as the shaft 12 is turned rela tive to the nut 16 .
