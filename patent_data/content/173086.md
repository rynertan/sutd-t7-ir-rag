## Description
This invention relates to an inline electron gun for a color picture tube according to the first part of claim 1 or claim 13, and in particular to the structure of electrodes constituting the main lens of this gun. The spherical aberration of the main lens is enumerated among various factors, which influence remarkably resolving characteristics of a color picture tube. It is known that the enlargement of the diameter of the electrodes constituting the main lens is efficacious for reducing the spherical aberration of the main lens. However, for an inline electron gun since the cylindrical main lenses corresponding to three colors of R, G and B are arranged in one same horizontal plane, in a class envelope, the diameter of the aperture should be smaller than 1 3 of the inner diameter of the neck portion containing the electron gun. By giving the thickness of the electrodes careful consideration and further by paying attention to the problematical points on the fabrication of the electrodes, this limit value is further decreased. If the inner diameter of the neck portion is increased, in order to raise this limit value, electric power for deflection increases. Moreover, in general, if the aperture is enlarged, the distance between central axes of the beams becomes greater with increasing distance from the center of the beam what gives rise to worsening of convergence characteristics. Usually, since the diameter of the aperture is so designed that it is as large as possible while giving these points considerations, it is extremely difficult to further enlarge it. In US A 4,370,592 and US A 4,429,252 have been proposed examples of non cylindrical main lenses permitting to enlarge effectively the aperture mentioned above beyond this limit value. The main lens disclosed in these patent specifications comprises two electrodes, each of which has an electrode plate provided with three apertures. Each of these electrode plates is disposed within a recess set back from the peripheral rim of the electrodes. Due to this arrangement, the potential produced by the counter electrode penetrates deeply into the interior of the electrode plate, what gives rise to the same effect as the increase of the diameter of the aperture. However, since the horizontal diameter of the cross section of the peripheral portion of the electrode is greater than the vertical diameter thereof, the penetration of the potential is remarkable in the horizontal direction. Due to this fact, the focusing force of the lens in the horizontal direction is weaker than that in the vertical direction and thus astigmatism is produced in the electron beam. In order to correct this astigmatism, US A 4.581.560 has proposed that the aperture is formed so as to be non circular and that the aperture diameter in the horizontal direction is smaller than that in the vertical direction. In this way, the astignatism can be removed by strengthening the focusing electric field in the horizontal cross section and by balancing the focusing forces in the horizontal and vertical directions. When the angle of incidence of the electron beam to the electrode and the spread of the beam in the main lens are small, the astigmatism can be removed in this manner. However, when the beam spread is large, electrons pass in the neighbourhood of the rim portion of the aperture in both the electrode plates. In this neighbourhood, since the intensity of the electric field is high, the focusing force in the horizontal direction is stronger than that in the vertical direction. As the result, the point where electrons are focused in the horizontal direction is farther in front of the screen than that in the vertical direction. Consequently the diameter of the beam spot on the screen in the horizontal direction is greater than that in the vertical direction and thus resolving power in the horizontal direction is reduced. Further, these phenomena are more remarkable with decreasing distance between the axes of the beams. The reason therefor is the decrease of the horizontal diameter of the aperture. Therefore, there is a limit to the decrease of the distance between the axes of the beams for the purpose of ameliorating convergence characteristics. When the diameter of the neck portion of the glass envelope is 29 mm, this limit is approximately 5.5 mm. In Patents Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 6, No. 6 E 89 884 14th Januar 1982 and JP A 56 128 551 08.10.81 an electron lens of axially asymmetry is described having three cylindrical electrodes with protrusive and hollow parts engageable to each other in end parts at a face to face position of said cylindrical electrodes. In contrast to the present invention the described electron lens is intended to produce within a single electron beam tube an elongated electron beam spot required by beam index color receivers or the like. The use of an electrode which overlaps the rim of another electrode is described in Electron Optics , O. Klemperer, Cambridge, 1971, pages 102 to 103. In contrast to the present invention the use of said overlapping electrode results thereby in a quadrupole lens whereas the present invention uses an octupole lens whereby the electron beam can be converged in every direction uniformly. It is an object of the present invention to provide an inline electron gun for a color picture tube permitting to enlarge the aperture without reducing the resolving power in the horizontal direction. This object is achieved by the invention by providing an inline electron gun for a color picture tube which generates a plurality of electron beams and directs them towards a fluorescent screen, comprising a main lens for focusing said electron beams, said main lens including a plurality of flat cylindrical electrodes which oppose each other with a certain distance and whose inner diameter H in a first plane containing the central axes of said electron beams is greater than the inner diameter V in a second plane perpendicular to said first plane, said electrodes having peripheral rims which oppose to each other, characterized in that at least one of said peripheral rims has such an uneven shape that the focusing force for the plurality of the electron beams is increased in the direction of the greater inner diameter H to be in balance with the focusing force in the direction of the inner diameter V of said electrodes. According to a further aspect the present invention is characterized in that the other one of the electrodes adjacent to said at least one electrode being so formed that it surrounds at least the peripheral rim of said at least one electrode coaxially. The present invention relies on the insight that the worsening of the resolving power in the horizontal direction by the conventional non cylindrical lens having a large aperture can be attributed to the fact that the electrode plates for correcting the astigmatism are disposed in the interior of the peripheral electrode. Therefore it is proposed to remove these electrode plates and at the same time to correct the astigmatism in the horizontal direction provoked thereby by forming the peripheral rims of the electrodes constituting the main lens in an uneven shape in the continuation of the cylindrical electrode wall. Fig. 1 is a partly cross sectional plane view of an inline type color picture tube provided with an electron gun according to this invention. A fluorescent screen 3, on which 3 color phosphors are applied alternately in a stripe shape, is attached to the inner surface of the face plate 2 of a glass envelope 1. Electron beams starting from cathodes 6, 7, 8 pass through apertures formed in a G1 electrode 9 and a G2 electrode 10, corresponding to these cathodes, respectively, and emerge along the axes 15, 16, 17 of the beams, respectively. The central axes of the cathodes 6, 7, 8 and those of the apertures formed in the G1 electrode 9 and the G2 electrode 10 coincide with those of the electron beams 15, 16, 17, respectively and these are substantially parallel to each other on a common plane. A direction on this common plane is called a horizontal direction and the direction perpendicular to this common plane on a plane passing through the axis of each of the beams is called the vertical direction. The three electron beams passing through the apertures formed in the G2 electrode 10 enter the main lens consisting of a G3 electrode 11 and a G4 electrode 12. The G3 electrode 11 is set to a potential lower than that of the G4 electrode 12 and the latter is at a same potential as a shield cup 13 and the conductive coating 5 applied on the inner surface of the glass envelope 1. Each of the 3 electron beams is focused by the main lens on the shadow mask 4. In this case, the 3 electron beams must be converged in one point and this operation is called static convergence STC . The electron beams focused on the shadow mask 4 are selected in color by the shodow mask 4 and only the component exciting and making radiate one of the phosphors of a color corresponding to each of the beams passes through a hole to reach the fluorescent screen. Further, an external magnetic deflection yoke 14 is disposed for scanning the fluorescent screen with the electron beams. Hereinbelow the construction of the electrodes constituting the main lens, which is the principal part of this invention, will be explained more in detail. Fig. 2 is a perspective view showing an embodiment of the main lens for the electron gun in the continuation of the cylindrical electrode walls according to this invention. As indicated in the figure, each of the G3 electrode 11 and the G4 electrode 12 consists of a flat cylindrical hollow electrode, whose inner diameter H in the plane comprising the central axes of the electron beams is greater than the inner diameter V in a plane perpendicular to the central axes and the peripheral rims 21, 22 of the electrodes opposing to each other are formed in an uneven shape according to this invention so that they are complementary to each other. In this figure, concave parts 31 are formed at the peripheral rim 21 of the electrode, whose potential is lower, and convex parts 32 at the peripheral rim 22 of the electrode, whose potential is higher. These concave and convex parts 31, 32 are disposed at the intersections of the peripheral rims and the plane, which is perpendicular to the plane containing the central axes of the electron beams and passes through the central axis of the electron beam, which is at the center among the electron beams. Fig. 3 illustrates a cross sectional view in the horizontal plane passing through the center line of the main lens indicated in Fig. 2 and the distribution of equipotential lines on the plane in a schematical manner. In Fig. 3 it can be understood that the equi potential lines indicated in broken line undulate along the uneven shape of the peripheral rims of the electrodes and that they bend around each of the central axes 15, 16, 17 of the electron beams so that they are convex towards the G3 electrode 11. Since this bending is stronger than that obtained when the peripheral rims 21, 22 of the electrodes have an even shape, electric field in the horizontal radial direction producing focusing force for each of the beams is strengthened on the horizontal cross section and the horizontal focusing force balances with the vertical one. When the focusing forces in both the directions balance with each other, it is possible to remove the astigmatism. The diameter of the effective aperture of this main lens agrees approximately with that in the vertical direction and thus enlargement of the aperture is achieved. In this case, the G3 electrode 11 and the G4 electrode 12 are hollow and they have no electrode plates, with which the prior art electron gun is provided. Therefore no worsening of the resolving power in the horizontal direction is produced. A concrete example of dimensions for the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 2 will be indicated below. The dimensions of the convex part 32 of the peripheral rim of the G4 electrode 12 are identical to those of the concave part 31 of the G3 electrode 11 corresponding thereto. The cross section of the G3 electrode 11 and the G4 electrode 12 has the shape of a track in a sports field, where the radius of the two semi circular ends is R. The distance s between the axes of two adjacent electron beams is smaller than the limit for the prior art large aperture non cylindrical lens stated above, which is 5.5 mm. Consequently it can be expected also to ameliorate convergence characteristics. Fig. 4 indicate beam exit characteristics for the center beam entering the main lens of this embodiment. In Fig. 4, the ordinate separates the tangent of the exit angle of the electron path and the abscissa the exit position of the electron path. If the tangent of the exit angle and the exit position wire proportional to each other and the relationship between them could be represented by a straight line in a cartesian coordinate, all the electrons would pass through a point and the aberration would be zero. The straight line representing this zero aberration is shown by a broken line A₀ in Fig. 4. The farther away the curve representing the relationship between the tangent of the exit angle and the exit position from this straight line A₀ is, the greater the abberation is. Fig. 4 shows aberration characteristics for electrons starting from a point on the central axis and entering a cylindrical lens, whose diameter is 10 mm, A₁₀, and horizontal aberration characteristics A Further, when the exit position is apart from the central axis, the curve A₁₀ representing aberration charactersitics of a cylindrical lens, whose diameter is 10 mm, deviates from the straight line A₀ representing zero aberration and the magnitude of its disaccordance is greater than that of the aberration characteristic curves A Further, in Fig. 4, the curve A In this way the diameter of the aperture of the main lens in the embodiment indicated in Fig. 2 is much greater than the upper limit for the cylindrical lens. In addition, the horizontal aberration characteristics are not worsened with respect to those in the vertical direction. Fig. 5 to 12 show other various embodiments according to this invention. Figs. 5 and 6 shows embodiments in which either one of the peripheral rims 21, 22 of the electrode 11, 12 has an even shape. The embodiment indicated in Fig. 5 has concave parts 31 and no convex parts 32. To the contrary that indicated in Fig. 6 has no concave parts 31, but convex parts 32. In both the cases, the periphearal rim 21 or 22 opposing to that having the even shape has an uneven shape so that focusing force in the horizontal direction for the electron beams is increased and thus the astigmatism can be removed. Figs. 7 and 8 shows embodiments, in which the peripheral rim 22 or 21 of one of the electrodes, 12 or 11, has the even shape, the aperture of the electrode being greater than the other, and the electrode covers at least the rim portion of the other electrode 11 or 12 adjacent thereto. This structure has an advantage that since the electron beam path is convered perfectly by the electrode 12 or 11, the electron beam is not influenced from the outside. In general, in the structure of the main lens, which has been used for the electron gun for color picture tube, a problem of STC drift is provoked. This is a phenomenon that the potential on the inner surface of the glass envelope 1 varies in time and this potential variation influences the outer electron beam path through the gap between two adjacent electrodes so that STC can be no more realized. In the embodiments illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, since the electron beam path is not influenced by the potential on the inner surface of the glass envelope, no problem of STC drift in the main lens is provoked. Figs. 9 and 10 shows two examples of the structure of electrodes constituting the main lens enabling that focusing forces in any directions other than the horizontal and vertical directions agrees with each other and that a beam spot shape further closer to a true circle is obtained. In the embodiments described above, although the focusing forces in the vertical and horizontal directions can agree with each other, focusing forces in oblique directions do not, and thus the beam spot shape is no more truly circular. In order to adjust focusing forces in oblique directions, in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 9, protrusions 30 are formed at the inner side of the electrodes in the middle portions between two adjacent points among three A, B, C at which the peripheral rim intersects the three planes perpendicular to the plane containing the central axes of a plurality of electron beams, each of which passes through each of the central axes. These protrusions 30 are so formed that the magnitude of the projection is greatest on the vertical planes containing the middle lines between the axes of the electron beams. The contour of each of the protrusions consists preferably of two arcs of two circles, whose centers are on the central axes of two adjacent electron beams, as indicated by broken lines D in Fig. 9. On the other hand, in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 10, protrusions 40 are formed at locations retreated with a certain distance towards the interior of each of the electrodes. In both the cases, electric fields in oblique directions are strengthened so that an electron beam shape close to true circle can be obtained. Figs. 11, 12 and 13 shows embodiments, in which this invention is applied to uni potential focusing UPF lenses. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 11, a high potential G4 electrode 12 is disposed between a low potential G3 electrode 11 and another low potential G5 electrode 18. To the contrary, in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 12, the G4 electrode is at a low potential and the G3 and G5 electrodes are at a high potential. In both the embodiments, as in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 2, the peripheral rims 21, 22, 23, 24 opposing to each other of the high and low potential electrodes comprise concave parts 31, 34 or 36, 37 and convex parts 32, 34 or 35, 38 having such a bent structure that the magnitude of retreat and projection, respectively, is greatest at the locations, where the peripheral rims intersect the three planes perpendicular to the plane containing the central axes of the electron beams, each of which passes through each of the central axes. This uneven shape strengthens focusing force in the horizontal direction and thus can remove the stigmatism. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 13, a high potential outer electrode 12 covers the portions adjacent to the gap of two low potential electrodes 11, 18 opposing to each other. Just as in the embodiments illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, since the electron beam path is not influenced by potential variations on the inner surface of the glass envelope, this embodiment has an advantage that no problem of static convergence STC drift in the main lens is provoked. Various methods for realizing STC can be used in the structure of the main lens for an electron gun according to this invention. The first method consists in that the main lens formed at the outer sides and focusing the side beams is inclined. Fig. 14 shows a horizontal cross sectional view of an embodiment to which this method is applied. When this figure is compared with the cross section indicated in Fig. 3, it is seen that, although the structures near the central axis 16 of the center beam are identical, the peripheral rims 21, 22 of the electrodes near the central axes 15, 17 of both the side beams are inclined. That is, the outermost portions of the peripheral rim 21 of the low potential electrode 11 protrude and the outermost portions of the peripheral rim 22 of the high potential electrode 12 retreat at a slope. The side beams are subjected to focusing force and at the same time to deflecting force towards the center beam. In this manner the 3 electron beams can be concentrated at one point on the shadow mask and thus STC is realized. The second method for realizing STC consists in that the axes of the lenses formed at both the sides among the lenses formed at the center and at the sides are shifted from the central axes of the paths of the side beams. Figs. 15 and 16 are cross sectional views in the horizontal plane passing through the center lines of two different embodiments according to this method and the form and the distribution of equi potential lines therein in a schematical manner. In Fig. 15, the lens central axes 15 and 17 formed at both the sides of the G3 electrode 11, which is at a low potential, coincide with the lens central axes 15 and 17 formed at both the sides of the G4 electrode 12 and they are shifted towards the inner sides with respect to the central axes 15 and 17, respectively, of the side beams. Consequently the side beams pass through the outer parts of both the side lenses and the side beams are subjected to deflecting force towards the center beam due to the focussing force of the lenses so that STC can be realized. In this case, the converging effect within the G3 electrode 11 overcomes the diverging effect within the G4 electrode 12 and the beams are subjected finally to converging force. In addition, in the case where the cross sections of the electrodes have semi circular parts at both the sides, the lens central axes coincide with the axes passing through the centers of these semi circules. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 16, the lens central axes 15 and 17 formed at both the sides within the G4 electrode are shifted outward with respect to the central axes 15 and 17 of the side beams, respectively, contrarily to the shifts of the axes within the G3 electrode in order that the side beams are further subjected to deflecting force towards the center beam not only within the G3 electrode 11 but also in the diverging lens region within the G4 electrode 14. For this this reason, this embodiment has an advantage that STC can be realized even for small shifts of the axes, because the side beams pass through the outer sides of the converging lens within the G3 electrode as well as the inner sides of the diverging lens within the G4 electrode so that they are subjected to deflecting force towards the center beam in both the regions. Furthermore, in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 16, even if 15 and 17 coincide with 15 and 17, respectively, or 15 and 17 coincide with 15 and 17, respectively, STC can be realized, because the side beams are subjected to deflecting force towards the center beam within the G4 electrode or the G3 electrode. In addition, in Figs. 2 to 16 illustrating embodiments of this invention, although the uneven shape of the peripheral rims opposing to each other of the electrodes is trapezoidal, various shapes can be applied therefor such as combinations of arcs, triangles, and so forth. Further, according to this invention, the main lens can be of multi stage type, obtained by combining a plurality of uni potential focusing UPF lenses and bi potential focusing BPF lenses. In this structure conventional cylindrical main lenses can be also used. As explained above, according to this invention, since the main lens of an electron gun is constituted only by electrodes having no electrode plate, the diameter of the effective apperture of the main lens can be enlarged to the diameter in the vertical direction of the electrodes and thus enlargement of the aperture is achieved. In this case curvature of equi potential lines in the horizontal plane is strengthened and focusing force in the horizontal direction can be increased to that in the vertical direction so that the astigmatism is removed, by forming the peripheral rims opposing to each other of a pair of electrodes constituting the main lens in an uneven shape. Since there are no electrode plates within the electrodes, aberration characteristics in the horizontal direction is not worsened. Consequently it is possible to reduce the distance between the axes of electron beam to a smaller value than before and to ameliorate convergence characteristics.
