# Manipulator having six degrees of freedom.

## Abstract
A manipulator having an object holder which can per form movements in three directions of translation and about three axes of rotation. The object holder is connected by means of coupling members to driving members secured to a frame. A modulator construction of the manipulator is pro vided in that the coupling members for the directions of translation and the directions of rotation are made substan tially identical to each other. The driving members of the di rections of translation and the directions of rotation are also of substantially identical construction. The modular con struction permits a very accurate form of construction to be provided with a minimum number of different components.
