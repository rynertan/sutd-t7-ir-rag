# Apparatus for providing a constant density trace of an analog signal.

## Abstract
The apparatus includes a record member with a thermally sensitive recording surface and a thermal stylus 6 deflected by any type movement responsive to an analog signal. A stylus heating element heats up in response to a voltage Eo representing the absolute value of the signal amplitude rate of change. The stylus thermal time constant nearly equals the minimum signal rise and fall times. Preheating the stylus 6 avoids gaps and dark portions in the trace. Thus the signal rate of change must be anticipated so that the stylus 6 is already at the desired temperature when it is deflected by the signal. Therefore delay means 8 are provided in the deflection circuit, the delay being a direct function of said stylus thermal time constant. The analog signal can also be converted to digital form and handled digitally prior to recording.
