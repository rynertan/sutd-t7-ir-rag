# Heteropolymer latices, methods of treating textile materials with them and laminates containing them.

## Abstract
Heteropolymer latices, methods of treating textile materials with them and laminates containing them are disclosed, wherein the latex particles comprise coreshell polymer prepared by emulsion polymerization of a shell monomer charge containing a minor amount of latent crosslinking monomer in the presence of polymer formed from a core monomer charge containing 0 to 0.3 graftlinking monomer or active crosslinking monomer and at least 4 latent crosslinking monomer. Latent crosslinking monomer, such as acrylamide and N methylol acrylamide, contains functionality which is reactive during and after polymerization upon drying graftlinking monomer, such as allyl methacrylate, contains functionality of different reactivity active during core formation and with the shell active crosslinking monomer, such as alkylene glycol diacrylates, has functionality of substantially the same reactivity for uniform crosslinking The bulk of the monomer charges preferably comprises one or more C1 C8 alkyl acrylates. Materials such as leather, leather substitutes and woven, knitted or nonwoven fabrics are treated, such as by direct or transfer coating, to form laminates which may also contain crushed foam layers between the latex and textile leyers.
