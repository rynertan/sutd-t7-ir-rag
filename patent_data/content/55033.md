## Description
Non Asbestos PaperThis invention provides non asbestos alternatives to asbestos papers.Asbestos papers contain asbestos fibres as the predominant raw material, these fibres being bound together with small amounts of hydrolysed starch, acrylic resin, or polyvinyl acetate to provide the necessary strength and flexibility. Such papers find use for a variety of purposes, e.g. as high temperature flexible insulation in electrical equipment. They are commonly made in the form of flexible sheet of thickness 0.1 1.5 mm. on conventional paper making machines such as the Fourdrinier. In the process an aqueous slurry of the ingredients which are to compose the product is progressively dewatered as a layer on a water permeable conveyor usually of wire mesh , the dewatered layer being subsequently compressed and dried.The present invention provides non asbestos flexible sheet material which has flexibility and toughness such that it is specially suited to conversion to corrugated form, suitable for use as thermally insulating material for pipes, domestic hot water boilers and the like.According to the invention, non asbestos flexible sheet material of thickness 0.1 1.5 mm. comprises a matrix of unfired ball clay which is reinforced by organic web forming fibres and by either i vitreous fibres derived from wool form material, or ii fine particles of a non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral the whole being bound together by a binder which consists essentially of a synthetic resin, said resin being of the acrylic or polyvinyl acetate variety said flexible sheet material being made by dewatering on a water permeable conveyor a layer of aqueous slurry of unfired ball clay, organic web forming fibres, and either i vitreous fibres derived from wool form material or ii fine particles of a non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral, said slurry containing a synthetic resin of the acrylic or polyvinyl acetate variety and compressing and drying the dewatered layer said aqueous slurry containing, by weight of solids content, ball clay 30 60 organic web forming fibres 3 158 vitreous fibres 20 40 or silicate mineral particles 25 55 synthetic resin binder 2 10 Our British Patent Application 2 031 043A publishedApril 1980 discloses a non asbestos product which comprises a matrix of unfired ball clay containing reinforcement and organic web forming fibres and which contains hydrolysed starch as complementary binder.However, although that product is made on paper making machinery, it is a board, i.e. inflexible compared to paper, and the function of the starch in it is to enable the board to be remoulded when wetted with water.In the product of the present invention referred to in the rest of the description as paper , the ball clay provides a flexible cohesive matrix. Ball clay is a fine grained, highly plastic, mainly kaolinitic sedimentary clay. The terms kaolinitic2 and kaolinite are mineralogical ones, indicating chemical composition and chemical structure they are not to be confused with the term kaolin , used to denote a highly refractory clay which approaches the mineral kaolinite in chemical composition and structure but which by contrast with ball clay is hardly plastic at all. Various types of ball clay have varying proportions of kaolinite, micaceous material, and quartz, with small amounts of organic matter and other minerals.Ball clays are used mainly in the manufacture of pottery and refractories, in admixture with other clays such as the kaolin mentioned earlier to impart plasticity to them and to increase the green strength of the unfired ware.The function of the organic web forming fibres is primarily to enable the paper to be formed on conventional paper making machinery, but additionally those fibres impart strength to the ball clay matrix of the finished paper, just as do the vitreous fibres derived from wool form material or the non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral the primary reinforcement . The organic web forming fibres are preferably cellulose fibres, but may alternatively be polyethylene or polypropylene fibres of the kind commercally available under the name PULPEX. In the preparation of the aqueous slurry to be dewatered, the web forming fibres are employed at a freeness of, 60 9Oo Schopper Riegler. If vitreous fibres derived from wool form material provide the primary reinforcement, the material may be mineral wool or glass wool. If glass wool is used, it is preferably employed in a form which has been treated with a silane coupling agent e.g. ganuna aminopropyl triethoxysilane . Preferably, the wool form vitreous fibre material employed has fibres which are predominantly in the range 0.25 5mm in length.If fine particles of a non fibrous charged layersilicate mineral are used as primary reinforcement, the particles should be capable of passing a sieve of aperture 250 pm. Preferably at least 75 by weight of the particulate non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral present should meet this specification.The non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral employed is preferably a mica or a chlorite. The chlorites have structures containing infinite two dimensional ions of opposite electrical charge, the negatively charged layers having compositions ranging from Mg3 AlSi301o oH 23 to tMg2Al A12Si2010 0H 2 , the positively charged layers having the composition Mg2A1 OH 6 . Such non fibrous charged layersilicate minerals are to be distinguished from non fibrous layer silicate minerals such as kaolinite, talc and pyrophyllite, where the infinite 2 dimensional layers e.g. A12 OH 4Si205 in kaolinite are uncharged.As already stated, the binder employed consists essentially of a synthetic resin, said resin being of the acrylic or polyvinyl acetate variety.Suitable acrylic resins are available in the form of synthetic polymeric latices consisting of a fine suspension in water of a copolymer based on an acrylic ester as the principal monomer.Suitable polyvinyl acetate resins are also available as synthetic resin emulsions consisting of a fine suspension in water of a polymer based on vinyl acetate.The paper may also contain a small proportion, suitably in the range of 1 10 of rayon fibres, to impart green strength to the sheet material between the dewatering and drying operations, and also to impart additional strength to the finished paper. The density of the paper will ordinarily be within the range 700 1100 kg m3, its tensile strength at least 3 MPa and its burst strength at least 40 KPa. The paper can be corrugated in a corrugating machine of standard construction, and withstands very well the stresses imposed by passage between the corrugating rollers of the machine.The invention is further illustrated by the followingExamples.
