# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PREPARING ARTIFICIAL HIDE OR HIDE BACKING AND THE HIDE OR HIDE BACKING THUS OBTAINED

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for preparing an artificial hide or backing for artificial hides, and the hide and backing thus obtained. The method comprises the steps of applying a liquid state pre polymer onto a textile base or weave, hot foaming and cross linking the pre polymer in an acqueous medium, and drying the product thus obtained. The apparatus comprises an applicator unit for applying a liquid state pre polymer onto a textile support or base, a processing chamber or tank wherein the pre polymer is exposed to hot water or steam, and a drier unit. The backing for artificial hides thus produced comprises a textile weave which is impregnated with a foam obtained from a liquid polyurethane polymer containing an active isocyanic group based agent.
