# SHIFT VALVE FOR HYDRAULIC CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION

## Abstract
According to the present invention, an axial width of one of two walls that separate three ports each other is longer than an axial width of the other wall. That is, a shift valve according to the present invention for a hydraulic control system for an automatic transmission comprises a valve bore formed with a first port connected to a source of oil pressure, a second port connected to a clutch, and a third port for discharging oil, a spool slidably fit in the valve bore and shiftable between a position where the first port is allowed to communicate with the second port and another position where the second port is allowed to communicate with the third port, and an axial width of the wall separating the first port from the second port is longer than the axial width of the wall separating the second port from the third port.
