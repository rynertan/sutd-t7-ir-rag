# Tube clamp.

## Abstract
Tube clamp structure wherein a split wear sleeve 11, 12 is applied to a metal tube 16 with such resistance to displacement along the tube that displacement wear is accommodated essentially only via the lesser displacement resistance which characterizes a limited axial range of sup port clamp 17 engagement around the sleeve. More par ticularly, the split sleeve has a bonded lining of friction material which contains heat courable adhesive.
