# Improved composition containing animal parts for production of a fried snack food and method for production thereof.

## Abstract
A puffable food composition is provided by extruding a mixture of ground animal parts and starch whereby the mixture is at least partially gelatinized during extrusion into a shape sustaining form. The form is puffed either at the die of the extruder, or in subsequent hot oil frying, or both. With added flavoring, the puffed composition has the taste, texture and mouth feel of fried pork skins. The process accommodates a wide variety of animal parts without the necessity of substantial changes in the process parameters.
