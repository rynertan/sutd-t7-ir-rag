# Somatostatin analogs, process for their preparation and pharmaceutical composition thereof.

## Abstract
Bicyclic somatostatin analogs and pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acid addition salts thereof are prepared by the solid phase method. These analogs have the property of inhibiting the release of growth hormone without affecting the level of gastric secretions or without affecting the level of gastric secretions, insulin and glucagon in humans and animals. The compounds are particularly useful in the treatment of acromegaly and diabetic retinopathy. Due to the bicyclic structure, these analogs are resistant to enzymatic metabolism and have a longer duration of activity than somatostatin.
