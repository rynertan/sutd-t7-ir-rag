# Therapeutic system for administering drugs to the skin.

## Abstract
A bandage for administering drugs to the skin that con sists of an impermeable backing layer, a drug reservoir layer composed of drug and a carrier, and a contact adhesive layer by which the bandage is adhered to the skin. The contact adhesive layer controls the rate at which drug is administered and maintains that rate at an approximately constant level by virtue of there being a particular correlation between the sol ubility of the drug in the carrier and the contact adhesive, the diffusion coefficient of the drug in the carrier and in the con tact adhesive, the concentration of drug in the reservoir, and the thickness of the contact adhesive layer.
