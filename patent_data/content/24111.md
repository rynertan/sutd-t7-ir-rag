# Photovoltaic systems, semiconductor photoelectrodes and processes of making semiconductors.

## Abstract
A photovoltaic system may comprise a Cd SeTe alloy junction forming material, preferably as a photoelectrode. A photoelectrode suitable for use in a photovoltaic system may comprise a Cd SeTe alloy. A semiconductor suitable for use as a photoelectrode may be made by a method comprising electrodepositing Cd SeTe onto a substrate followed by heat treatment or by applying a slurry providing Cd SeTe and then annealing the slurry.
