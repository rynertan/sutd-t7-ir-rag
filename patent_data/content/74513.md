A cuff structure particularly for ski boots, according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises a pair of threaded pegs 10 arranged symmetrically about the center, at the side area of said inner cuff 3 . 7. A cuff structure particularly for ski boots, according to the preceding claims, and as herein described and illustrated for the objects specified.

## Description
This invention relates to a cuff structure particularly for ski boots. As is known, a current trend in ski boot manufacturing is toward increasingly taller cuffs or leg portions of the boots. This approach brings about considerable advantages to the practice of skiing in a majority of likely conditions. On the other hand, however, there may arise situations where excessively tall cuffs actually hamper a skier. Moreover, tall cuffs may be difficult to adapt to the leg morphology of some skiers, so that it would be necessary to arrange for a wide range of boots with different height cuffs. It is a primary object of this invention to overcome the above problems by providing a cuff structure for ski boots which enables the height of the cuff to be changed at will. It is a further object of the invention to provide a cuff structure which is simple to manufacture and, above all, can be controlled directly by its user without involving any complicated operations. Another object of this invention is to provide a cuff structure which involves no special constructional complexities for its manufacture, and is reliable in use. According to one aspect of the invention these and other objects, such as will be apparent herein after, are achieved by a cuff structure particularly for ski boots, comprising an outer cuff articulated to the shell of a ski boot, characterized in that it comprises an inner cuff telescopically coupled to the top of said outer cuff, means being further provided for mutually fastening said inner and outer cuffs together. Further features and advantages will be more apparent from the following detailed description of a cuff structure particularly for ski boots, with reference .to the accompanying illustrative drawing, where Figure 1 illustrates schematically one embodiment of the cuff structure according to the invention Figure 2 is a detail view of the cuff as incorporating fastening means arranged at the front and rear and Figure 3 is a longitudinal section through the coupling of the outer and inner cuffs. Making reference to the cited figures, the cuff structure for ski boots, which is generally designated with the reference numeral 1, comprises an outer cuff 2, which can be articulated at the bottom, in a manner known per se, to the shell of a ski boot, not shown in the drawing. The outer cuff 2 is so configured as to affect the front or rear portion and side regions of the skiers leg. The main feature of the invention is that to the top end of the outer cuff 2 an inner cuff 3 is telescopically connected which is also configured to affect the front or rear portion and side regions of the skier s leg. The inner cuff 3 can be positioned at various height levels relatively to the outer cuff 2 and,for this purpose, means are provided for mutually fastening the inner cuff 3 and outer cuff 2 together. The cited means advantageously comprise at least one threaded peg 10 embedded with its base into the inner cuff 3 and projecting outwardly through a longitudinal slot 11 defined in the outer cuff.For fastening purposes, a tightening ring nut 12 is provided which is threaded onto the peg 10 and tightens firmly together the inner cuff 3 and outer cuff 2 such that they are prevented from slidingly inadvertedly with respect to each other. The cited fastening means, as shown in Figure 1, mag be two in number and provided at the side areas of the cuff, or possibly, as shown in Figure 2, a single threaded peg 10 may be provided, in which case it would be located on the cuff front. To avoid any protruding thickness on the cuff inside, which may hamper and inconvenience the user, the outer cuff 2 defines, at the area thereof adjoining the inner cuff 3, a recessed internal area 20 having substantially the same thickness as the inner cuff 3, thereby the inside surface of the inner cuff 3 is approximately flush with the inside surface of the outer cuff 2 at the area affected by the inner cuff 3. The cuff of this invention is extremely simple to use. In fact, to adjust the cuff height to a desired level, it will be sufficient for the user to make the inner cuff slide with respect to the outer cuff, after releasing the ring nut 12, until it is brought to the desired position. After this preliminary positioning step, the user will tighten the ring nut or ring nuts 12 down, thus obtaining a cuff the working height whereof can be adjusted at will0 As shown in the drawings, it is possible to provide the inner cuff with wide adjustment range features, such that a single cuff can meet the varying requirements of a large number of users, while affording a cuff the height whereof is always the best for a given style of skiing and the most comfortable for the particular morphology of the individual skier s legs. In practicing the invention, the materials used, as well as the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any suitable ones for the intended applications.
