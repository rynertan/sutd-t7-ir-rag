## Description
This invention relates to a tubular element in which temperature sensors are inserted into suitable essentially longitudinal seats provided in the wall of said tubular element.when suitably disposed, said tubular element specifically enables the temperatures of superheater tube walls to be measured, in order to enable any exceeding of the allowable temperature limits to be immediately checked.Measuring the wall temperatures of the constituent tubes of a superheater is known to be of particular importance, as said tubes are subjected to large temperature gradients, to aggressive products of combustion, and to high temperatures.This measurement is currently made using commercial thermocouples mounted on the tube surfaces and or suitably supported on the outside of the tubes. The aforesaid chemical and physical conditions enable thermocouples mounted in this manner to operate correctly only for periods of a few weeks, such periods being unacceptable and of little significance in the effective control of the plant.There are currently no superheaters which are instrumented or provided with protective systems and alarms which make it possible to act in order to save the tube bundle, in pnttIeular during the temperature transients at plant start up. The object of the present invention ii to provlde r device able to make local zesurements of the tube wall temperatures to enable any exceeding of the temperature limits tolerable by the stperheater to be immediatel r checked.This object Is attained by a tubular element provided with a temperature sensor, in particular for measuring overtemperatures in the tube bundle of superheaters in thermoelectric power plant steam generators, characterised by comprising a pair of concentric tubes forcibly locked one into the other by a mechanical plastic deformation process, at least one of the two tubes comprising in the mutually contacting surfaces a series of longitudinal grooves into which said temperature sensors are inserted.The characteristics and advantages of an instrumented tubular element constructed in accordance with the present invention will be snore apparent from the description given hereinafter with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which Figure 1 is a partly broken longitudinal section through an instrumented element according to the invention Figure 2 is a cross section through an element such as that ofFigure 1 andFigure 3 is a cross section equivalent to that of Figure 2, before undergoing a drawing process.With reference to the drawings, a tubular element according to the invention indicated by 10 comprises a first tube 11 into which a second tube 12 is concentrically inserted with a gap of a few tenths of a millimetre.A series of longitudinal grooves 13 are ponced in the e t r surface of the second tube 12, and have a cro section of essentially circular profile, obtained for example by Thtlling followed by smoothing or polishing.The two tubes 11 and 12, inserted one into the other, are subjected to mechanical cold drawinr, effected wtth an internal mandrel, which forces the two said tubes together to create positioning seats 14 for thermocouples 15.In the vicinity of an end portion 17 of said tubular element 10 constituted in this manner there are provided arcuate bores or seats 16 which connect the seats 14 to the outside of the tubular element to enable the thermocouples 15 to be connected to measuring systems not shown . An end portion 17 of the tubular element 10 which is free from thermocouples 15 enables it to be assembled by welding, with the thermocouples 15 already inserted, these latter undergoing no danger of damage and emerging into a zone which is not exposed to the aggressive fluids, and lies beyond a wall 18.The drawing process carried out with an internal mandrel provides for a tube diameter reduction of 5 lOX and a simultaneous analogous thickness reduction so that the two tubes remain strongly forced together to provide good thermal contact. Before being drawn, the contacting surfaces undergo chemical pickling treatment and the surfaces which slide in the drawbench undergo bonderizing. The state of tension induced by the drawing operation, together with the pressure of the process fluid inside the tubular element, oppose any separation of the two tubes caused by differential expansion in the presence of temperature gradients. In particular, for equal total thicknesses ie the sum of the two , it is convenient to thin down the tube exposed to the fluid of higher pressure. Furthermore, in order to improve thermal contact between the two tubes inserted one into the other, a series of longitudinal welds can be provided in suitable number, made for example by means of an electron beam or a similar method.
