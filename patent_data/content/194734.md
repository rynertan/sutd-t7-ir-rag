# Electrically enhanced liquid jet processing.

## Abstract
An electrically enhanced liquid jet process particularly adapted for forming scribe lines on thin film material deposited during fabrication of thin film solar cell devices. A narrow jet of liquid solution 56 is directed onto a thin film 52 along a desired line 58 while an electrical current is passed through the liquid jet and the film being processed. The liquid solution is selected to remove material along the desired line only at its point of contact with the film but to be substantially nonreactive with the film in all other areas where there is an absence of electrical enhancement.
