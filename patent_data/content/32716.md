# ILLUMINATION SYSTEM FOR SEMICONDUCTIVE WAFERS

## Abstract
A projection lens 18 is disposed directly above a vacuum chuck 131 for projecting an image of an illumi nated portion of a semiconductive wafer 14 held thereby to an image plane 79 where that image may be viewed through a pair objective lenses 88 of a compound micro scope 22 . Microcircuitry contained on a reticle 12 held by a holder 17 positioned above tha projection lens 18 is photometrically printed onto the semiconductive wafer 14 by passing exposure light through the reticle 12 and the projection lens 18 to the semiconductive wafer 14 . At least one fiber optic source 140 156 of illuminating light and one or more optical lenses 142, 144 152 158, 160 are employed for projecting an image of the fiber op tic light source 140 156 through the objective lens 88 to an entrance pupil of the projection lens 18 without passing through the reticle 12 to provide uniform illumi nation of the semiconductive wafer 14 and facilitate di rect wafer alignment prior to photometrically printing on the semiconductive wafer 14 .
