# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TEXTILE YARN PRODUCTION

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for producing a felted rope or roving wherein rovings or slubbings of wool or blends of wool with other fibres are subjected to an oscillatory rubbing movement. In order to produce a felted rope or roving of a quality which enables it to be used as a substitute for conventional spun yarns the oscillatory rubbing move ment is carried out in the presence of water. The oscil latory rubbing movement is carried out at several sta tions using several pairs of rubbers 32. Water heated to a predetermined temperature is fed to each of the rubbers. Excess water is removed using a pair of squeeze rollers 40 and the felted rope or roving is further dried using heated drums 42. The speed of for word movement, the rate of oscillation and stroke of the rubbers is controlled to give the desired degree of felting.
