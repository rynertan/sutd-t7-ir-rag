# SIMILIFIED CONNECTIONS TO CONTROL SPEED RELATING TO ELECTRICAL ROTATING MACHINERY

## Abstract
The present invention discloses AC electrodynamic machines, such as electric motors, which are able to be operated in either a high speed mode or a low speed mode by not energising one 7 of the windings 6,7, 8, 9 of the machine or by energising the one winding 7 so as to induce a magnetic pole of reverse polarity to that conventionally induced, respectively. Methods of operating AC electrodynamic machines are also disclosed.
