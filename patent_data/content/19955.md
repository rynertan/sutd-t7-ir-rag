## Description
Benzofurancarboxylic acid derivatives, their preparation and their inclusion in lipogenesis inhibiting comrositions This invention relates to benzofurancarboxylic acid derivatives, to their preparation, and to their use as lipogenesis inhibitors in mammals. Published UK Patent Application No. 2,007,973 relates to a broad class of benzofurancarboxylic acid derivatives which are described as having lipogenesis inhibiting activity in mammals.The synthesis of certain of those compounds was also described byWitiak, D.T., et al in Lipids, 11 1976 5 , 384 391. The applicants have now discovered a novel class of benzofurancarboxylic acid derivatives having lipcgenesis inhibiting activity in mammals. According to the invention there is provided a benzofurancarboxylic acid derivative of formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is a substituent at the 5 position on the benzofuran ring system and is a.thienyl group, or a phenyl, phenoxy, benzyl or benzoyl group substituted by a group selected from alkoxy of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, hydroxy, acetyl, acetyloxg, l hydroxyethyl, acetam ao ana amino, or is a substituent at the 4 position of the benzofuran ring system and is a phenoxy group optionally substituted by a group selected from alkyl and alkoxy of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, hydroxy, acetyl, acetyloxy, l hydroxyethyl, acetamido, amino, fluoro, chloro, bromo and nitro RÚ and Rê represent hydrogen atoms or RÚ and Rê together represent a single chemical bond and represents a hydroxy group, an alkoxy group of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a 2 propenyloxy group, or, when R and R represent hydrogen atoms, a 2 propenylamino group. When R1 and R2 represent hydrogen atoms and R3 represents a 2 propenylamino group, conveniently R is a substituent at the 5position on the benzofuran ring system and is a thienyl group, or a phenyl, phenoxy, benzyl or benzoyl group substituted by an alkoxy group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a l hydroxyethyl group or an acetamido group, or is a substituent at the 4 position on the benzofuran ring system and is a phenoxy group optionally substituted by alkyl or alkoxy of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, acetamido, 1hydroxyethyl or nitro. When R3 represents a hydroxy group, conveniently R is a substituent at the 5 position on the benzofuran ring system and is a phenyl, phenoxy, benzyl or benzoyl group substituted by a group selected from alkoxy of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, acetyl, acetoxy, and hydroxy, or is a substituent at the 4 position on the benzofuran ring system and is a phenxoy group optionally substituted by a group selected from alkyl and alkoxy of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, nitro, acetyl, acetoxy and hydroxy. When R represents an alkoxy group of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a 2 propenyloxy group, conveniently R represents a 5 4 1 hydroxyethyl phenyl, 5 4 acetamidophenyl or 4phenoxy group, or, when RÚ and Rê together represent a single chemical bond, a 5 4 acetylphenyl , 5 4 acetyloxyphenyl or 5 4 aminophenyl group. When R is a substituted phenyl, phenoxy, benzyl or benzoyl group, the substituent is preferably attached at the 4 position thereof. An alkoxy substituent in R is preferably methoxy. R is preferably a substituted phenyl group attached at the 5 position of the benzofuran ring system or aphenoxy group attached at the 4 position of the benzofuran ring system. In preferred compounds of formula I, R is a substituent at the 5 position on the benzofuran ring system and is a phenyl group substituted at the 4 position by an acetyl, acetyloxy, hydroxy, methoxy, 1 hydroxyethyl, acetamido or amino group or is t a phenoxy group attached at the 4 position on the benzofuran ring system Advantageously, R is a 5 4 acetyloxyphenyl , 5 4 1 hydroxyethyl phenyl , 5 4 acetamidophenyl or 4 phenoxy group. It is further preferred in the compounds of formula I that P3 represents a hydroxy, methoxy or ethoxy group or, when R1 and Rê represent hydrogen atoms, a 2 propenylamino group. A particularly preferred group of compounds of formula I for their advantageous lipogenesis inhibiting activity in mammalian tissue is the group wherein R3 is hydroxy, RÚ and Rê together represent a single chemical bond and R is 4 phenoxy or acetyloxyphenyl R3 is methoxy or ethoxy and R is 5 4 1 hydroxyethyl phenyl or 5 4 acetamidophenyl and R3 is 2 propeny lamino and R is 4 phenoxy or 5 4 acetamidophenyl . The invention also provides a process for preparing a benzo furancarboxylic acid derivative of formula I which process comprises reacting a salicylaldehyde of formulaEMI3.1 where R is attached at the 5 or 6 position of the benzene ring and is R as defined above or a group which is convertible to R, with a halomalonate ester of formulaEMI3.2 where Hal is bromine or chlorine and each R4 is alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the presence of a base to give a benzofurancarboxylate ester of formula EMI4.1 followed, where necessary, by conversion of R to R, reduction 4 to R with sodium amalgam and or conversion of R to P Conveniently Hal in the compound of formula III is bromine.The preferred compound of formula III is diethyl bromomalonate.The reaction of the compounds of formula II and III is conveniently effected using an alkali metal carbonate, e.g. potassium carbonate, in anhydrous conditions in an inert solvent such as 2 butanone.Suitable conditions for this type of reaction are disclosed byKurkudar and Rao, Indian Acad. Sci., Section A, 58, 336 1963 . The precursor RÚ subsituted salicylaldehydes of formula II can be prepared by treating the appropriate phenol with chloroform under strongly basic conditions, according to the Reimer TiemannReaction. References cited in The Merck Index, 9th edition, page ONR 74 also, Russell, A. and Lockhart. L.3., OrganicSynthesis, 22, 63 1942 . Many of the precursor phenols are known compounds others can be prepared by conventional procedures. For example, alpha 4 hydroxyphenyl thiophene, the precursor phenol for the compound of formula I wherein R is a 5 2 thienyl group can be prepared by either or both of the methods disclosed by M.A. Al perovich, et al, Zh. Obschch, Khim., 34, 645 50 1964 Chem. Abst., 60, 14639d 196 4 , and Y. Ahmad, et al. Canadian Journal of Chemistry, 45, 1539 42 1967 . P is converted where necessary to an R group by known methods. then the R group in the compound of formula II is different from the R group in the eventual compound of formula I, it may be another R group as defined above, or an unsubstituted phenyl, phenoxy, benzyl or benzoyl group. Thus for example, if the starting compound of formula II is 5 phenylsalicylaldehyde, the R group in he compound of formula IV will be a 5 phenyl group. A 4 acetyl group may be introduced in this phenyl group by conventional Friedel Crafts acylation. This acetyl group many subsequently be converted to an acetyloxy group by a treatment with trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide.The acetyloxy group may in turn be hydrolysed, e.g. using potassium hydroxide in ethanol, to a hydroxy group. The hydroxy group may be converted to an alkoxy e.g. methoxy group by treatment with the appropriate alkyl iodide in basic conditions, e.g. in the presence of potassium carbonate. Similarly, the acetyl group may be converted to a l hydroxyethyl group by appropriate reduction, e.g. using sodium borohydride in ethanol, or it may be converted to an acetamido group by reaction with hydroxylamine followed by Beckmann rearrangement of the resulting l hydroxyimino ethyl derivative. The acetamido group may in turn be hydrolysed in acid conditions, e.g. in the presence of hydrochloric acid, to an amino group. Reduction with sodium amalgam is conveniently effected according to the method of Fredga, Acta Chem. Scand., 9, 719 1955 . The reduction may be effected after the P group has been hydrolysed to a hydroxy group, or the reduction may be effected with hydrolysis in a single reaction sequence, to give a 2,3 dihydrobenzofurancarboxylic acid which, if desired, may subsequently be esterified in known manner. In general, the P group may be hydrolysed to a hydroxy group in known manner by base catalysed hydrolysis using for example sodium or potassium hydroxide, conveniently in ethanol as solvent. The hydroxy group may then be esterified in known manner to give an R group which is alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a 2 propenyloxy group, e.g. by Fisher Speier esterification of the acid with the appropriate alcohol, i.e. by treating the acid with the alcchol using the alcohol itself as solvent, or using a solvent such as benzene or toluene, in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or p2ra toluenesuloonic acid. It will be appreciated that by the above methods there may readil y be prepared 2,3 dihydrobenzofurancarbo. ylic acid esters of formula EMI6.1 where R is as defined above and R5 is an alkyl group. When R5 is an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the compounds of formula V are compounds of formula I. Compounds of formula V are intermediates in the preparation of compounds of formula I wherein R3 is a 2 propenylamino group. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a process for preparing a benzofurancarboxylic acid derivative of formula I wherein RÚ and Rê represent hydrogen atoms and R represents a 2 propenylamino group, which process comprises reacting a 2,3 dihydro 2 benzofurancarboxylic acid ester derivative of formula V with2 prQpeny1amine. Conveniently the process of this aspect of the invention is effected in the presence of an alkanol of one to four carbon atoms as solvent, and R5 is an alkyl group of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In a preferred process, R5 is ethyl and the process is effected using ethanol as solvent. The reaction will go forward at room temperature however, higher temperatures for example, the mixture can be refluxed may be employed to reduce the reaction time. Preferably, about a four to six fold excess of the 2 propenamine is used. The desired product can be recovered by evaporating the solvent and excess amine, then employing conventional techniques such as selective extraction, recrystallization and or dry column chromatography, to isolate the desired product. Compounds of formula I have exhibited lipogenesis inhibiting activity in mammalian tissue. Chirality exists in the compounds of formula I wherein R1 and R are hydrogen atoms, hence they can exist in two optical isomeric forms. None of the isomers has been separated, nor has the lipogenesis inhibiting activity of any of the individual isomers been determined. The individual species that have been prepared inhibit lipogenesis. Under the circumstances, the invention contemplates the active individual isomers, as well as mixtures thereof. Compounds of formula I can be used to inhibit lipogenesis in mammals such as, for example, pets, animals in zoo, livestock, furbearing.animals and domestic animals, including, but not limited to dogs, cats, mink, sheep, swine, cattle, horses, mules and donkeys. The effect is obtained by administering an effective amount of one or a mixture of the inhibitors orally or parenterally to the animal. They may be administered as such, or as an active ingredient of a conventional pharmaceutical formulation. They may be administered orally by any convenient means. Thus, they may be orally administered as a drench, by intubation, in the animal s food and water, in a food supplement or in a formulation expressly designed for administration of the drug.Suitable formulations include solutions, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, tablets, boluses, powders, granules, capsules, syrups and elixirs.For parenteral administration, they may be in the form of a solution, suspension, dispersion or emulsion. They can be administered in the form of an implant or other controlled sust ained release formulation. Inert carriers, such as one or more of water, edible oil, gelatin, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc or vegetable gum can be used. The dosage of the inhibitor needed to inhibit lipogenesis will depend upon the particular compound s used, and the particular animal being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the inhibitor is administered in a dosage of from about 1 to about 500 milligrams per kilogram of the animals body weight. The inhibitor can be administered in a single dose or in a series of doses in the same day, or over a period of days. For any partic ular animal, a specified dosage regium should be adjusted accord ing to the individual need, the particular inhibitor used, and the professional judgement of the person administering or super vising the administration of the Inhibitor. accordingly the invention also provides a lipogenesis inhibiting composition comprising a compound of formula I in association with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier therefor. Further provided is a process for preparing a lipogenesis inhibiting composition which comprises bringing a compound of formula I into association with pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier. The invention also includes a method of inhibiting lipogenesis in a mammal which comprises administering to the mammal orally or parenterally a compound of formula I or a composition according to the invention.

Compounds of formula I have been found to inhibit lipogenesis in tissues of mammals. The manner in which they cause this effect is not known with certainty it is believed that they interfere with the synthesis of fatty acids in the tissues.Their effectiveness for this purpose has been ascertained by immersing samples of swine adipose tissue in a liquid medium containing radioactive glucose and the test chemical for a period of time, the isolating the lipid from the treated tissue and determining the uptake of the radioactive carbon by means of scintillation counting techniques. These tests were conducted in swine adipose tissue because in swine, the primary site of lipogenesis i.e., fatty acid synthesis appears to be adipose tissue. Described in morse detail, the tests were conducted according to the following general procedure 150 milligrams of slices of swine adipose tissue were incubated at 370C for 2 hours with shaking in 3 milliliters of KrebsRinger bicarbonate solution containing one half of the normal calcium ion concentration, 60 micromoles of glucose, 0.5 microCurie of glucose U14C, and 300 micounits of insulin, and 5 dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO . The test compound was added as a solution or suspension in DMSO and was present as a concentration of 100 micrograms per milliliter of incubation mixture. The incubation was terminated by addition of 0.25 milliliter of 1 N sulfuric acid. The resulting mixture was extracted with total of 25 milliliters of chloroform methanol 2 1, v v . The extracts were washed according to Folch et al. J. Biol. Chem., 226, 497 509, 1957 , air dried, and counted in a liquid scintillation countre with 15 milliliters of counting fluid two parts toulene containing 0.4 w v New England Nuclear Omnifluor 1 part TritonX 100 . The tests were conducted in triplicate and were accompanied by control tests in which all ingredients, proportions and conditions were the same except that no test compound was included. From the data obtained were calculated the percent inhibition of lipid synthesis by the test compound. The data obtained are reported as the percent inhibition of lipogenesis compared to the results obtained in the control tests wherein only the test compound was omitted. The results are summarized in Table I. Table I Compound Percent Inhibition 1 28 2 83 3 27 4 20 5 77 6 24 7 56 8 41 9 80 10 30 11 56 12 71 13 85 14 15 52 16 45 17 88 18 76
