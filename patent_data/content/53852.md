# Solar collector.

## Abstract
A solar collector comprising an absorber for transferring solar heat to a heat transporting medium in a duct which is arranged in heat exchange relationship with the absorber, the absorber being insulated from the surroundings by at least one evacuated tube containing a reversible hydrogen getter which consists of one or more of the metals titanium, zirconium, hafnium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, the rare earths, strontium, barium, vanadium, niobium tantalum, thorium and alloys of these metals in a partly hydrogenized condition, and also a fully hydrogenized metal which is thermally more stable and has a higher oxygen affinity than the partly hydrogenized metal, mixture or alloy.
