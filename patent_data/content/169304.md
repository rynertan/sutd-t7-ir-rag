# Foamable polyvinylidene fluoride and a method for producing it.

## Abstract
Foamable and foamed polyvinlyidene fluoride materials prepared by compounding the PVDF with a suitable nucleat ing agent of discreet insoluble particles, a blowing agent having an activation temperature above the melting point of the PVDF, and a dispersing aid to provide a substantially homogeneous powdered mixture that is then melt com pounded with high shear melt blending means and then extruded and quenched to provide the foamable polyviny lidene fluoride material which can then be extruded as an insulating material on wire at a temperature sufficiently high to activate the blowing agent.
