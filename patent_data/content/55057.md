# REDUCING POLYACETYLENE CROSSLINKING AND EMBRITTLEMENT

## Abstract
A process for reducing polyacetylene oxidation and em brittlement comprises contacting undoped polyacetylene with a liquid solution of pH greater than 7 of a anthraquinone and or an anthraquinone salt and base and reducing agent and or b pyrogallol and or c a hydrosulfite. The contact may be by immersion either for storage of cis and or trans polyacetylene or during processes for con verting cis polyacetylene to trans polyacetylene. The so treated polyacetylene may subsequently be doped.
