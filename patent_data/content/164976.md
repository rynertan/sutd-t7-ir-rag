# Method of producing a contact for a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A method of producing a semiconductor device compris ing the steps of forming a window or contact hole in an insulating layer 2 to expose a portion of a semiconductor substrate or a lower conductor line forming semiconductor material silicon in the window substituting the material with a metal tungsten by reaction of the semiconductor material with metal compound WFâ‚† gas and forming a conductor line 6 over the metal within the window. In this way, the contact hole can be fixed with a metal in a shorter period of time and with better reproducibility as compared with the prior art.
