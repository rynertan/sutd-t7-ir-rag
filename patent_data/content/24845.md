## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR REMTING TO EXERCISINO DEVICES. This invention relates to an exercising device and, more specifically, to the so called baby bouncer type of child exercising device. Baby bouncer type exercising devices are well knol.m in the art and generally comprise a child support arrangement resiliently suspended from a fixed elevated location so that a child, in the support arrangement, is resiliently suspended beneath the fixed elevated locat on and can exercise 5y pushing with its feet o toes against the ground to cause the support arrangement to bounce up and dons. The fixed location from which the baby bouncer is suspended may comprise a special stand or any other relatively fixed elevated location, such as the lintel of a doorway or the branch of a tree. The actual fixed elevated location for the baby bouncer forms no part of the present invention but it will be understoo that the baby bouncer proposed by the present invention can be suspended from any fixed elevated location capable of supporting a conventional baby bouncer. The child support arrangesent conventionally comer sews a crutch supporting arrangement depending from a waist band with four flexible members extending from locations spaced around the waist band upwardly to a single suspension point, or to suspension points on a yoke or frame which yoke or frame is itself suspended from a single suspension point. The resilient suspension may be provided by the flexible members comprising resilient members or by a single resilient member between the single suspension point and the Pixed elevated location but with all the prior art constructions the resilient member, or members, absorbs loadings on the child support arrangement by extending in tension, Thus, there is always the danger that, in the event of the, or a, resilient member failing under load the resilient member and those parts of the support arrangement supported by the resilient member below the failure can t rJhip dolvmwardly and strike the child. Surther9 in the event that the resilient support comprises the four flexible members, failure of one flexible resilient member may allow the child support arba gere to tip, to the detriment of the child , whilst with the single resilient support member failure of that support will cause the child, and the bouncer parts beneath the failure, to fall to the ground. The invention as claimed is intended to provide a baby bouncer type exercising device in which the af ore mentioned disadvantages of the conventional baby bouncer are avoided. According to the present invention there is provided an exercising device comprising a child support arrangement and a support means for resiliently suspending the child support means from a fixed location, characterised in that said support means including a resilient member arranged to deform in compression to absorb loadings applied to the support means. The advantages offered by the invention are mainly that as a resilient member can only be placed in compression between two opposing surfaces a partial collapse of the resilient member simply allows the said opposing surfaces to come closer together whereby the support is maintained and, in the event of a complete collapse,including loss of the resilient member from between the opposing surfaces, the opposing surfaces will make contact affording a nonresilient support for the child support arrangement.Thus, even the event of a complete collapse and loss of the resilient Dc ber, the support of the child support arrangement is maintained without harm to the child. Preferably the child support arrangement comprises a band, intended to surround the lower trunk regions of the child, and a crutch strap for retaining the child within the band. Preferably the resilient member comprises a coil sprit and or a resilient body. Preferably also a resilient damper is provided to act in opposition to the said resilient member and, conveniently, said resilient damper comprises a coil spring or a resilient body 43 . When the resilient member, and or the resilient damper, comprises a resilient body said body preferably comprises a plurality of resilient elements in stacked relationship in the direction of compression and each resilient element conveniently defines a chamber which is isolated from atmosphere by deformation of the element when the element is in compression. Preferably the resilient member is pre loaded in compression. In a preferred embodiment in accordance with the invention the resilient support is arranged to afford a relatively low frequency of vertical oscillation so that the support cannot attain a frequency which may be detrimental to the child. Ways of carrying out tht invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 shows, in front view, the upper part of a baby bouncer exercising device including a resilient member. Fig. 2 shows a side view of the arrangement illustrated in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 shows, on an enlarged scale, a crosssection through part of a resilient body for use with the device of Figs. 1 and 2, Fig. 4 shows a viewS similar to Fig. 3, with the resilient body deformed in compression, Fig. 5 shows, in perspective view, a child support arrangement for the baby bouncer, Fig. 6 shows, in cross section, an alternative resilient support arrangement for an exercising device and, Fig. 7 shots an alternative arrangement for the lowest end of the resilient support illustrated inFig. 6. Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, a baby bouncer type exercising device is suspended from a ring 11, anchored to a fixed elevated location not shown , the device attaching to the ring 11 by a hook 12, provided with a safety locking screw 13. The hook 12 is formed on one end of a rod 14 which passes through a clesrance hole not shown in one end wall of a rectangular metal frame 15, within frame 15 the rod 14 passes axially through a resilient body1 generally indicated by reference numeral 16, and the lower end of rod 14 is threaded to allow a washer 17 beneath the resilient body, generally identified by reference numeral 16, to be secured by a nut 18 on the end of rod 14. A belt 19, adjustable in length by a buckle 20, couples the end wall of frame 15 remote from rod 14 with a metal coupling 21 and two flexible members 22 and 23 pass through the coupling 21 and each flexible member 22 and 23 has its two ends secured to a child support arrangement not shown in Figs 1 and 2 . It will be seen that with the above described assembly the weight of a child in the child support arrangement and the weight of the child support arrangemenv is applied via flexible members 22 and 23 to the coupling 21, this load is transmitted through adjustable belt 19 which is adjusted in length as desired to correctly locate the child relative to the floor and from adjustable belt 19 the entire load on the baby bouncer is applied to the frame 15. As frame 15 is totally supported by the resilient body 16 and the lower regions of body 16 are supported by the washer 17 and nut 18 on anchored rod 14, vertically dol.zwçarQ loads applied to the frame 15 cause resilient body 16 to b axially compressed between the upper end wall o frame 15 and washer 17. The resilient body 16 comprises a plurality of resilient elements 24, each of which is defined by a body of revolution and each of which comprises two spaced apart generally parallel end walls 25 connected by a wall 26 which extends from each wall 25 axially and radially to an enlarged diameter, indicated by reference numeral 27, in the mid plane between end walls 25. The end walls 25 are of substantially uniform thlcirness and the arcuate wall 26 is of generally uniform thicn,zness so that each element 24 defines an internal air chamber 28. The end walls 25 include axial bores 29 through which the rod 14 passes and the bores 29 are of such diameter that the elements 24 readily slide along rod 14 when the elements 24 are unstressed. When a load is applied to the baby bouncer, so that the body 16 is placed in compression, the elements 24 are axially compressed and the compression force applied to each element 24 is initially absorbed by deformation of the arcuate wall 26 of that element. Rowever, as each element is axially compressed, the volume of its respective air chamber 28 is reduced, reduction in the volume chamber 28 causes an increase in the air pressure in that chamber 28, and such increase in pressure not only absorbes part of the loading but progressively increases the resistance of the element 24 to further axial compression. Thus, the resistance to axial delormation of each element 24 .ncreases as the deformation increases and the resilient body as a whole absorbs loadings thereon partially by deformation of the body material and partially by compres3ion of the air volume within the elements 24. It will be seen that any partial failure of the body 16, due to failure of one or more resilient elements 24, simply renders body 16 less effective in absorbing the axial loads so that the body 16 may adopt a reduced axial length, without adverse effect on the bouncer or the child. It will also between that with the above described arrangement a defective element 24 may be replaced by simply unscrewing nut 18, removing washer 17, removing the required elements 24 up to and including the defective element 25,and then re assembling the resilient arrangement to include a new element 24. In the most extreme case where the resilient body 16 completely fails, due to failure of all the resilient elements 24, and falls away from the rod 14, the frame 15 will simply displace relative to rod 14 until the washer 17 engages with the upper end wall of frame 15, when the downward movement of frame 15 will be arrested and the bouncer will be simply supported by frame 15 rested on washer 17.Thus, even with a complete failure and removal of the resilient body 16 from the baby bouncer, the bouncer will Still be fully supported and injury to the child will be avoided. Fig.5 illustrates a child support arrangement for a baby bouncer and which comprises a crutch part 31, to which the ends of flexible members 22 and 23 are secured as by stitching, and a waistband 32, sewn to the crutch part 31 and having at each side, adjustable length means9 illustrated as press stud fasteners 33. The child support arrangement illustrated in Fig.5 is one conventional child support arrangement but any other child support arrangement may be substituted therefor and used with the support means proposed by the present invenloa, In the support arranOeaent illustrated in Fig. 6 the rod 14, with hooked end 12 secured to the fixed ring 11 as by safety screw 13, extends downwardly through a clearance hole 34 in an end wall 35 of a cylinder 36, the hole 34 being concentric with the axis of cylinder 36. Within cylinder 36 the rod 14 pastes axially through a coil compression spring 37 and through a washer 38 retained on rod 14 by a nut 39 on the threaded end of rod 14. Thus, the coil spring 37 is contained within cylinder 36 and is axially compressible between end wall 35 and the washer 38. A coupling 40, attached to the lower regions of cylinder 36 by a bolt 41 passing through cylinder 36 supports the adjustable strap 19. The rod 14 has a washer 42 secured thereon just below the hooked end 12 and between washer 42 and the end wall 35 the rod 14 passes axially through a resilient body, generally indicated by numeral 43 and comprising three resilient members 24, identical with, and arranged to operate in identical manner to, the resilient elements 24 illustrated and described with reference to Figs. 1 to 4 inclusive. In operation, and with the child in the child support arrangement suspended from adjustable strap 19, loads applied by the child in the downward direc tion are absorbed by compression of the coil spring 37 and as the child touches the floor, so that the child supports part of its own weight, or the child kicks against the floor to effectively reduce the loading on the support arrangement, the reduced loading allows spring 37 to extend raising the child support arrangement with the child therein. Thus, the child can easily set a bouncing t oscillation in the device. Preferably the spring 37 is pre loaded axially compressed by adjusting nut 39 on rod 14 and such pre loading is balanced by equal compressive loading of the resilient body 43. Thus, if a child in the child support arrangement loads the child support arrangement doa ,araly the load is absorbed by compression of spring 37 and the cylinder 36 is downwardly displaced relative to the rod 14. When now the loading is reduced the spring 37 extends, thus displacing cylinder 36 and the child support arrangement upwardly relative to rod 14 and, towards the end of the oscillation, the resilient body 43 is compressed between washer 43 and the end wall 35 of cylinder 36, to effectively dampen the oscillation. In the event that the spring 37 becomes damaged, but still retains part of its length effective between washer 39 and end wall 35, the child support arrangement is safely supported and the only ill effects will be that the support means will not have the resilience of an undamaged spring 37 and the mean position for the child support arrangement may be closer to the ground. In the unlikely event that the spring 37 is so damaged it has no effective length between washer 39 and end wall 35 the washer 39 will engage end wall 35 to retain support of the child support arrangement. In the event that the spring 37 is damaged, or a differently rated sprint 37 is to be substituted, it is only necessary to remove the bolt 41, separate the cylinder 36 from te coupling 40, and the cylinder 36 can be pushed up the rod 14 to allow access to the nut 39. With the nt removed, washer 38 can be removed from rod 14, the spring 37, or the remains of spring 37, can be reLovea 9 and the new spring fitted on rod 14, followed by re application of washer 38 and tensioning of the new spring 37 by nut 39 on rod 14. Fig. 7 shows a modification to the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 6 and whereby two resilient elements 24 are inserted between spring 37 and washer 38 to provide a damping in the event that the child is able to bounce so high that the spring 37 attains maximum contraction. It will now be appreciated that the resilient member may comprise a coil compression spring, such as spring 37, a resilient body such as body 16, or a combination of a spring 37 and resilient elements 24.
