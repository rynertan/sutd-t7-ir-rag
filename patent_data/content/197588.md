# A method for the processing of a cable end and cable connector for connection to the cable.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method from the end of cable having a screened, multicore of conductors provided with an outer sheath, and to a connector for the same. The cable is cut to provide an auxiliary sheath tube and an end sheath, both of which are utilised during process to expose and fold the screening. The signal conductors of the cable are connected to the insulated contact block of a connector. The ground terminal of the connector contacts the folded over screening. The connector includes strain relief means.
