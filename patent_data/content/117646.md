# Semiconductor memory device with reading writing control circuitry.

## Abstract
A bipolar RAM includes pairs of word lines W , W , pairs of bit lines B₀, B₁ , static memory cells CEL at intersections of word lines and bit lines, constant current sources I The bases of two transistors T Hence fewer constant current sources are required and the device can operate at high speed with reduced power consump tion.
