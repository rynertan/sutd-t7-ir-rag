# Compositions for stabilizing a vinyl or vinylidene halide polymer or chlorinated polyethylene, polymer compositions comprising such a stabilizer composition and shaped articles prepared therefrom.

## Abstract
Compositions for stabilizing a vinyl or vinylidene halide polymer or chlorinated polyethylene which comprise a major proportion of a at least one ester tin compound, for example β carboalkoxyethyl tin mercaptides, β carbo alkoxyethyl tin mercapto acid esters and the like and a minor proportion of b at least one unsubstituted or alkyl substituted o dihydric phenol, such as catechol, t butyl catechol and 2,3 dihydroxy naphthalene. These compositions synergistically contribute to the heat stability of vinyl or vinylidene halide polymers or chlorinated polyethylene. The performance of the compo sitions disclosed is particularly improved as regards resis tance to early discolouration and long term heat stability of the ester tin compounds contained in them. Moreover, the amounts in which the compounds need be used for stabilization can be kept relatively small.
