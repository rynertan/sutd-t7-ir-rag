# Organometallic adducts.

## Abstract
A method of preparing an adduct suitable for conversion into a compound semiconductor of formula M¹ R¹ If x 3 then y 3 and z 1. If x 2 then z 1 or 2 and yz 2. The radical L is provided by a solvent which is an aliphatic ether having between 3 and 12 carbon atoms, preferably a cy clic ether having betwen 3 and 8 carbon atoms. For example L may be provided by tetrahydrofuran or dioxan. The preferred procursor adducts which are of the form M³ R³ ₃.thf where M³ is indium or gallium, R³ is C₁ to ₇ alkyl and thf is tetrahydrofuran are also described.
