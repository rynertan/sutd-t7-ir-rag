# Method and apparatus for producing cement or plaster.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for forming a cement or plaster slurry, for example, for use in mines, in which bags of cement or plaster are fed into a substantially closed chamber 15 , are ruptured, and water is fed into the chamber at a controlled rate. The resulting mixture is fed into a macerator 13 which serves to comminute the bag material and to mix the cement or plaster which is then fed into a pump 11 , preferably a posi tive displacement pump, such as a helical gear pump and this is pumped to the point of use.
