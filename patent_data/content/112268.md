# Mechanical seal with back up seal for gas turbine engines.

## Abstract
In a twin spool gas turbine engine a bellows 34 serves to bias a carbon seal 16 against its seal plate 10 and a piston ring back up seal 51 spaced radially outward and axially from the carbon seal 16 provides a controlled leak path in the event the bellows 34 fails.
