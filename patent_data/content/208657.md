# ELECTRONIC REVERSE SELF SYNCHRONOUS ELECTRIC MOTOR

## Abstract
This invention relates to a new. alternating current AC electric motor, the main feature of which resides in the perfect rotational stability between rotor and the stator rotating field which is achieved by rotor drag imposed by the stator rotating field to which the rotor is magnetically coupled and in the possibility of being able to vary rotation speed at any time by means of a regulator.
