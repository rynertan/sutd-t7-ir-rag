# LOW TEMPERATURE HEAT SHRINKABLE FILM AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME.

## Abstract
Low temperature shrinkable film comprising a straight chain, low density polyethylene resin of a density of 0.935 g cm³ or less having short branched chains, and having film properties of 5 or less in haze value, 30 or more and 5 or less in thermal shrinkage ratios at 90 C in M ant T directions, respectively, and 300 g mm² or more in shrink able stress at 90 C in an M direction. This transparent film with good low temperature shrinkability is produced by stretching polyethylene resin film between two rolls of 200 mmø or less with an air gap of 10 mm or less and a stretching ratio of 3.0 to 6.0. An inflation having a multi layered structure can be obtained by pressing or press stretching a plurality of films of the polyethylene resin, which has excellent transparency, good strength, and uniform film thickness.
