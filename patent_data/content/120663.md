# Four column positioning mechanism for calender machines.

## Abstract
A positioning mechanism for four column calendar machines is disclosed. The mechanism employs an intercon nected piston and cylinder arrangement to permit the rolls to be quickly separated and subsequently automatically repositioned. The rolls are supported on a plate assembly movable on a vertically disposed way mounted on the col umns. A lost motion arrangement is provided in the plate assembly so that when a paper break occurs or when it is otherwise desired to separate the rolls quickly, the cylinders are released permitting rapid relative movement between the rolls to prevent damage.
