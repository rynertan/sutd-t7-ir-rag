# Automatic gain control circuit.

## Abstract
An automatic control circuit for a video camera is dis closed which includes an error detecting circuit for detecting and generating an error data, a control signal generator sup plied with the error data and for generating a control signal and a control circuit supplied with the control signals and for con trolling a controlled circuit for the video camera, wherein said control signal generator mixes a reference correcting data gen erated from the error data with the control signal thereby to generate a new control signal and the control signal generator includes a circuit for changing the polarity of the reference cor recting data and decreasing the absolute value of the reference correcting data when the error data changes its polarity and a circuit for averaging the plural control signals each of which is generated when the reference correcting data is at its minimum value and the error data changes its polarity, the output of the averaging circuit being the control signal.
