# METHOD OF REDUCING ENCROACHMENT IN A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
A nitride layer of a semiconductor device is etched to expose a portion of a layer of silicon dioxide, in turn disposed on a semiconductor substrate, and a thin layer of polysilicon is deposited over the resulting structure prior to growth of an insulating region in the form of a field oxide, with the nitride layer being used as a mask.
