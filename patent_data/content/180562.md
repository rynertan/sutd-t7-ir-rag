# Sampling circuit for microwave signals.

## Abstract
A sampling circuit for microwave signals comprises a substrate S , a planar microwave guide PL on one side of the substrate and a conductive surface on the other. A slot line is formed by a rectangular insulating area B on the other side, and a drive pulse conductor KX is connected to opposite edges of the insulating area for supplying the sam pling pulses. On one side of the substrate there are two separate conductive surfaces A1, A2 , which together with the conductive surface A on the other side forms the capa citors included in the sampling circuit. Two discrete diodes D1, D2 are connected between the microwave guide and the respective surface A1, A2 , and resistors R1, R2 are connected between these surfaces and planar output waveguides UL1, UL2 for the sampling circuit.
