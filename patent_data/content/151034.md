# Method of and apparatus for forming and cartoning multi stack arrays of compressible articles.

## Abstract
The apparatus forms multi stack arrays of compres sible, generally flat articles for example, elongate cata menial napkins on a receiving platform disposed adjacent a stack forming apparatus by pushing one stack against the back wall of the receiving platform, and then pushing suc cessively formed stacks into adjacent relation with the last stack pushed onto the receiving platform. This is done with a stack pusher, and controlling the lengths of its successive strokes as required. Upon moving each stack into its respec tive position on the receiving platform, it is individually com pressed to reduce the height of the stack to about the height of the carton into which the array is to be loaded as a unit. An array pusher then pushes the array orthogonally with res pect to the direction of pushing the stacks onto the receiving platform to displace the array as a unit into a carton through a loading funnel. Preferably, elongate articles such as cat amenial napkins are oriented in the associated stacker so that, relative to the length dimension of the articles, the stacks are displaced sideways from the stacker on to the receiving platform so that the stacks are oriented in side by side relation with each other. Individual compression of each stack substantially obviates any interleaving or damage of the articles in adjacent stacks which might otherwise occur particularly at high stack pusher velocities.
