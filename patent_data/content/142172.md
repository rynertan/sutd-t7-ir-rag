# COMPOSITION USABLE AS ADHESIVE

## Abstract
A new polymerizable composition of matter, especially an adhesive composition that is advantageous as a dental adhesive for bonding with acrylic and metal materials. The composition includes polar organic composition chosen from the group consisting of acids and salts and mixtures thereof, multifunctional vinyl crosslinking composition, and a solvent composition giving said new polymerizable composition sol vent action. The preferred polar organic is an acrylic acid, the prefer red multifunctional vinyl crosslinking composition is difunc tional acrylic crosslinking monomer, and the solvent prefer ably includes dicyclopentenyloxyethyl methacrylate. The composition preferably further includes urethane diacrylate oligomer and a polymerization initiator system, preferably visible light curing with an accelerator. Methods of forming dentures are also disclosed.
