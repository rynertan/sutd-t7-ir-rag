# METHOD OF MAKING WIRE TERMINATIONS

## Abstract
In interconnecting an electrical wire 16 to a conductive terminal 14 having wire receiving slots 26 therein arranged in intersecting disposition, the wire 16 is indexed to a tool T and then to the terminal 14 . The wire is located into the slots 26 , without making connection thereto by applying a light force transversely thereto by a wire pushing element 38 . The connection is made by forcibly inserting the wires into the slots by the pushing element 38 that is configured with a plurality of intersecting splines or vanes 38a to engage the wires 16 and enter the slots 26 within their boundaries during insertion. Such entering of the slots 26 by the splines 38a on the pushing element 28 provides a uniform force application and a full seating of the wires 16 deeply into the slots 26 along a wire length greater than its diameter such that the wires 16 are deformed and wedged tightly in the bottom of the slots 26 .
