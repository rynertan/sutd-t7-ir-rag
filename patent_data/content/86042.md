# Continuous synthesis of chromium dioxide.

## Abstract
A continuous chromium dioxide synthesis process con sists essentially of feeding through an extruder screw 14 while preheating, to just below the temperature at which incipient reaction occurs, a viscous paste mixture comprising CrO₃, Cr₂O₃ and H₂O at elevated pressure to a reaction zone in the form of a twin screw reactor 15 advancing the paste mixture in a starved nonflooded mode through the reactor 15 , at elevated temperatures and pressures, the residence time being sufficient for the paste mixture to react to form CrO₂ continuously venting byproduct oxygen and steam 34 , thereafter injecting water 40 at high pressures into the reaction product to form a viscous CrO₂ H₂O slurry, and discharging the slurry from the reactor 15 into a separate pressure let down zone 48 , wherein the slurry is cooled and depressurized to atmospheric pressure.
