## Abstract
A system and method for controlling the relative position ing of two objects, more particularly for controlling the hori zontal and vertical alignment of a materials handling vehicle 40 with storage locations 18 of an article storage structure 10 , includes a target 20 positioned at each storage location and a sensor 80 positioned on the materials handling vehicle and including three detectors 84, 86, 88 positioned in a trian gular pattern and responsive to the alignment of the detectors with a target to provide control signals employed to control the positioning of the vehicle for the accurate horizontal and vertical alignment of the vehicle with storage locations of the system.
