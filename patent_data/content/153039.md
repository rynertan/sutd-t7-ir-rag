## Description
Lubricant for skis and the like Background of the Invention This invention relates to wax which is applied on various sliding surfaces such as running surfaces of skis for improving their sliding characteristics. Wax of this kind, especially ski wax is adjusted of its physical property by selecting paraffin in accordance with an atmospheric temperature and snow temperature. Since the selection of paraffin determines largely win or lose of a ski tournament, ski players and ski manufacturers make a frantic search for proper wax, by measuring atmospheric and snow temperatures just before their start. For popular skiers, there is available in the market such wax which does not require specific adjustment of paraffin and can widely be used on various snow conditions.However, multipurpose wax of this kind adversely affects the sliding property of skis often when it is used at a low atmospheric temperature by which snow becomes powder, and the wax has a drawback that a layer made by it on the running surfaces of skis comes off rather easily.Brief Summary of the Invention In view of the above mentioned background, this invention is to provide a lubricant which is easy to deal with and can give excellent sliding characteristics irrespectively of snow conditions. More particulary, this invention is to provide a lubricant which is made from an element selected from a group consisting of gallium and molybdenum disulfide. The lubricant is referred to herein as a wax, although metallic. First, this invention is briefly explained further when gallium is employed. Metallic gallium having the melting point of 29.6 10C, density of 5.91g cc, and thermal condu ctivity of 0.29 0.38 at 300C is soft at a low tempera ture, glossy, and easy to handle to various shapes. It has been found in this invention that gallium having the above mentioned physical properties could advantageously be employed as such ski wax which can be applied on running surfaces of skis readily and evenly without hurting the surfaces, can be applied on them by having it warmed in a warm water when it is cold, and can be applied on them thinly with a minimum amount since it is malleable.It is advantageous also that metallic gallium which is applied on sliding surfaces becomes harder when it abuts on snow sur faces of a low temperature, whereby it can have a longer life than paras fix wax. Experiments show that wax made in accordance with this invention has made such good sliding performance on various snow conditions, viz. such as fresh snow, granulated snow, damp snow, and ice up snow which the conventional multipurpose wax can hardly attain. While metallic gallium can present alone such good sliding performance, its melting point becomes lower so that it becomes more easier to deal with, its frictional resistance against snow surfaces becomes lowerer so that skis can run faster, and its production cost becomes cheaper, when it is alloyed with a specific amount of one or more of metallic elements such as In, Zn, Sn, Al and others.The specific amount is 20 60 weight for In, 10 20 forZn, 10 30 for Sn, and 3 5 for Al. The balance is Ga, composition of which with one or more of the aforementioned metallic elements of the above mentioned specific amount can easily be mixed and melt at a temperature lower than 1000C, as shown by phase diagrams of Ga with said metallic elements. Metallic elements other than the aforementioned metallic elements can be employed so far that they can make alloys with Ga, and can be melt at a temperature lower than 1 000C. As mentioned above, Ga alloys come to have a melting point lower than Ga, that is about 300C. For example, a binary alloy of Ga 76 In 24 has a melting point of 15.70C, and a ternary alloy of Ga 82 Sn 12 Zn 6 has a melting point as low as 170C, whereby they become more easier to deal with. And, it is found for this end that Ga has to be more than 60 when it constitutes a binary alloy, and more than 30 when it constitutes a ternary alloy. It is found also that the addition of Zn to Ga is effective especially when atmospheric and snow temperatures are comparatively high. One of the most advantageous points of ski wax of this invention which is made from Ga is that it can be warmed by hands and softened so that it can be applied readily on running surfaces of skis and then spreaded by a piece of gauze or sponge evenly over the surfaces. This work takes time extremely lesser than that required with the conventional ski wax. The conventional wax is applied by means of a burner or iron, shaved portionally so as to make it smooth, and then applied again. This is quite laborious. As mentioned above, it is an advantageous point of this invention wax that it can be safely used for tournaments, because it is hardly affected by snow conditions, as tested in the following Example 1. Second, this invention is briefly explained further when molybdenum disulfide is employed. Molybdenum disulfide, MoS2 has an atomic structure in which a single Mo atom is sandwiched at its two lateral sides by two atoms of S, and belongs to a hexagonal system, and its nolecules are cleavable to each other. Its grains have a flat form which is indeterminate but oval, and thickness of which is about 1 20 of longitudinal axis thereof.Its color is silver gray or black gray, and it has Mohs scale of hardness of 1 1.2, a specific gravity of 4.8 5.0, and a thermal conductivity of 0.328 cal. cm 1 deg 1. Though it is considered to be a semi conductor, its outer membrane becomes conductive when it is strongly compressed.In addition, molybdenum disulfide has characteristics that its resistance reduces when a temperature elevates. Molybdenum disulfide alone having the above properties, or its mixture with paraffin can provide, in this invention, wax which is afforded with good sliding and coating charac teristics. This characteristics are far superior to those afforded to paraffix wax, and even superior to those afforded to the conventional multipurpose ski wax which is made from paraffin mixed with aluminium. While commercial powders of molybdenum do sulfide have an average grain diameter of 0.5 5p , it is preferable in this invention to use the powders of diameters less than about 1.0p, , because such powders have better affinity with paraffin and can produce better sliding and coating characteristics. Thus, it shall be noted that while molybdenum disulfide alone can provide excellent ski wax, its mixture with paraffin can also provide wax which is rich with sliding characteristics and comparable to wax which is prepared specifically for competition purposes. In fact, wax made from molybdenum disulfide and paraffin in accordance with this invention works best for damp and fasten snow.Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments This invention is further described below by way of examples. Example 1 Comparative sliding tests were conducted between the two kinds of conventional wax and the wax made in accordance with this invention. They are as follows. a Multipurpose ski wax of trade name of TOKO made inSwiss, consisted of paraffin wax mixed with aluminum. This multipurpose wax was applied on running surfaces of a pair of skis. The wax was spreaded evenly over the surfaces by an iron, and then wax surface was thinly shaved off. And, the wax was applied and spreaded once again, and finished. b Competition wax of. The The red and yellow of competition wax of trade name of HOLMENKOL made in Germany were mixed at a ratio of 1 1 by melting them by a burner. This mixed wax was applied on running surfaces of skis two times as in the above a , and finished. b 2 The red and white of competition wax of trade name of TOKO made in Swiss were mixed at a ratio of 2 1 by melting them by a burner. This was applied two times as in the above a , and finished. c This invention wax. Three kinds of wax made in accordance with this invention, viz. one made from Ga alone, another of Ga 60 In 40 , and further another of Ga 80 Zn 20 were applied each on running surfaces of a pair of skis, and they were finished by spreading evenly over the surfaces by a piece of gauze. Two skiers who were instructors of All Japan Ski League and representative players at Japan National Games wore the skies and tested them ten times. Test course had an average slant of 150 and distance of 250 meters. Average times required for the skies are as given in the following Table 1. Table 1.
