# Pipe connector.

## Abstract
A pipe connector for connection to a pipe having a plain end comprises a body 10 having a profile matching that of the pipe, and a pair of jaws 12 extending outwardly for insertion within the end of the pipe. The jaws are formed with oppositely directed clamping surfaces 24, 26 for engaging the inner wall surface of the pipe end. One of the jaws 14 is fixed and integral with the body 10 . The other jaw 16 is pivotally mounted on the fixed jaw 14 and is extended inwardly of the body 10 where it is threadedly engaged by a screw 38 which connects the pivoted jaw with the body so that by rotating the screw 38 in the appropriate direction the pivoted jaw 16 pivots away from or towards the fixed jaw 14 to clamp or unclamp the jaws from the pipe. The screw 38 thus provides a positive clamping force which greatly assists the dismantling of the connector from a pipe end when desired. The screw 38 also retains the pivoted jaw 14 in place and there are no loose parts to become lost.
