# Floppy disc drive head cleaner.

## Abstract
A floppy disc drive head is cleaned by using a cleaning disc 44 replaceably insertable into a disc jacket 10 through an open edge thereof. Only the disc needs to be discarded when soiled. The jacket is adaptable for single or double sided drives by means of a peelable label or cover strip 32 which covers the head window 30 on one side of the jacket.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A method of cleaning flexib ,e disc drive drive heads, comprising inserting a cleaning disc into a jacket one edge of which remains at least substantially open, inserting the thusformed cartridge into the disc drive, operating the disc drive to clean the drive head or heads, removing the cartridge from the disc drive, and removing the spent cleaning disc from the jacket. 2. Apparatus for cleaning flexible disc drive drive heads, comprising a disc jacket one edge of which remains at least substantially open, and one or more cleaning discs removably and replaceably insertable into the jacket. 3. A disc jacket for use in the method of claim 1, having one edge remaining at least substantially open. 4. A plurality of cleaning discs for use in the method of claim 1, the discs being individually usable in a single jacket. 5. Apparatus for cleaning flexible disc drive drive heads of one or two sided configuration selectively, comprising a disc jacket containing a cleaning disc, in which the jacket comprises a peelable cover over the head window position on one side of the jacket.

## Description
FLOPPY DISC DRIVE IGEAD CLEANER This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for cleaning flexible disc, or floppy disc, drive drive heads. As is well known in the computing and eord processing and like arts, floppy discs are used as magnetic storage media.They comprise discs of a few inches diameter, typically about 8 inches about 20 cm or about 5 inches about 13 cm though other sizes have been proposed, formed of a magnetisable polyester based material which can be rotated at high speed and written into or read from by an appropriate magnetic head. These discs are prone to malfunction if they become dirty or covered with dust, and for this reason it is vitally important that they are kept as clean as possible. For this purpose the disc is invariably sealed in a PVC jacket which has a central hole to receive a hub, by which it is rotated, and a peripheral aperture, usually in the shape of a radial slot, constituting a head window to permit the reading and writing head to have access to the disc. These discs can be designed for singlesided or doublesided read write heads and the jackets therefore have a head window on one or both sides respectively, as appropriate.The assembly of a jacket and disc is known as a cartridge. The reading and writing heads themselves pick up debris, in particular oxides from the surface of the rapidly rotating disc. For optimum efficiency, accuracy and life of the equipment it is important to clean the heads frequently with an appropriate cleaner. It has been proposed, for the purposes of cleaning a floppy disc drive head, to use a disc formed of Ã  lint free absorbent material which is wetted over a substantial area of the disc with a solvent. In order to apply the solvent it has been found necessary to provide a relatively large aperture in the disc jacket which has its disadvantages. Furthermore, the disc has a limited life, but in view of the expense of the provision of the disc and jacket it is necessary to use each disc a substantial number of times. A record of the number of tines the disc is used uust be kept to avoid head damage by abrasion. The knows proposals cope with the possibility of one or tvrsided operation by providing the head window in one side of the jacket with a knockout section. The tab which fills this window can, however, come free of its own accord and cause serious damage to the mechanism when operating at high speed. This invention has as its object to improve on and in particular, to simplify the prior devices such as that described above. The invention will be described by way of example with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a disc jacket embodying the invention Figure 2 illustrates the blank required to make the jacket shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3 illustrates the manner in which a doublesided disc jacket is used for a single sided drive. Referring to Figure 1, there is seen a disc holder or jacket 10 which is of generally square shape and is formed fran a rectangular sheet 11 of PVC of the shape shown in Figure 2 appropriately folded and welded. As shout in Figure 1 there is a central hole or window 12 which receives the drive hub of the floppy disc drive, and a small index hole or window 14 for control purposes. A write control or inhibit notch 16 may be cut in a side edge of the jacket, and relief notches 18 can be provided in the reference edge 19. The jacket 10 is in normal use made into a sealed whole containing a magnetisable disc by folding over the three flanges and welding them so as completely to seal the jacket. In the present instance however one 20 of these flanges is not folded over so as to seal on the opposed side of the disc but is folded back on itself, as shown in the detail 1A, so as to provide a stiffened edge 22 utich is nevertheless not a sharp cutting edge. The opposed edge of the disc is slightly relieved at its central portion by means of a semi circular cut out 24, to facilitate access for thumb and f ingers. Thus, a circular cleaning disc can be inserted into the jacket through the one open side and can be removed therefrom by the user. The same jacket may thus be used Tor a large number of different cleaning discs, and it is not necessary to purchase a new jacket when the disc becomes dirty. Furthermore, the solvent can be applied directly to the whole, or part, of the disc surface before it is inserted without the need to have an access aperture cut in the jacket, which exposes the disc to the risk of external contamination. The jacket includes slots forming a hea d vindow 30 to allow the reading and writing head to have access to the disc. In the basic form of jacket there are slots through both the opposed sides of the jacket so that that the disc can be used in a double sided environment. However, it may be required only to use it in a single sided drive, and therefore, one of the two slots is covered by a suitable covering strip 32 Figure 3 which carries adhesive 34 around the slot area but not within it, as shown by the shaded areas.This covering strip 32 can be peeled off if The device is to be used in a doublesided drive Three possible arrangements are shown at a , b and c in Figure 3. As shown at a5, the covering strip 32 carries cutouts corresponding to the notches l8 in the periphery of the jacket. The alternative shown at b has a slightly smaller covering strip or label 32 which carries adhesive 34 up to an inner limit 33 which is just larger than the head window 3G but surrounds the windowThe modification shown at c has areas of adhesive 34 only along the long sides of the slots forming the head window 30, leaving the end portions 35 free of adhesive. It may prove possible to use a film of another form of plastics or a paper strip. However, the use of a polyester covering strip has the advantage that if the cleaning disc is also polyester then there is less friction at the polyester polyester interface between the cleaning disc and the label. It will be appreciated that the label may be used in conjunction with a knock out section filling the slot on one side of the jacket. That is to say a jacket having a knock out section or cut out section on one side at the position of the head window will also have a label applied over it. To convert to single sided operation both the label and knock out section are removed. In manufacture the labels can be affixed by hand or by a suitable machine. The cleaning disc, which is cut out into the same configuration as the normal floppy disc, may be formed of a Du Pont polyester material Reemay 2033 The inner periphery 40 and outer periphery 42 of the disc 44 are shown in dashed lines on Figure 1. A standard tape drive cleaning fluid may be used in the form of an aerosol or applied simply fran a dropper bottle. The covering strip may be formed of Mylar polyester film.Typically the cleaning disc will be rotated in the drive for about 30 seconds to clean the head or heads. Preferably the cleaning disc is thrown away on each occasion as it is a relatively inexpensive iten. However, it will be appreciated that the cleaning disc can be retained for a number of uses and it is possible to inspect the whole disc very easily by removing it from the jacket. Thus the degree of contamination of the disc is readily apparent. The jacket is adapted very easily from single to double sided u by the user simply by peeling off the label.
