# CAP FOR SEALING CONTAINER

## Abstract
A snap type cap for sealing against escape of gases through an opening in an end closure of a container having contents therein which dissociate a gas therefrom. The cap includes a seal portion 32 to engage with a sealing lip 30 around the opening in the container end to provide an initial low pressure seal and a second high pressure seal as progressively higher pressures within the container exceed the sealing limit of the initial low pressure seal. The cap may further include an opening portion adapted for contacting an opening panel 27 in the container end and effecting an opening in the container by applying pressure against the opening panel through the opening portion. An improved easy open container end having a smooth sealing lip for cooperating with the cap for resealing and a method of making such an end are also disclosed.

## Claims
1. A cap adapted for a substantially gas tight sealing engagement with a container having contents therein from which gas dissociates with the container having an opening in an end thereof for dispensing its contents and a continuous lip having a substantially smooth sealing surface thereon around the opening, characterized by the fact that the cap comprises a seal portion having a top wall, a skirt depending from the top wall having at least a portion thereof adapted to fit in interference with a portion of the sealing surface on the container lip sufficient to effect a low pressure seal, and a ledge having an upwardly facing surface thereon pro jecting from said skirt, the low pressure seal effective to enable pressure within the container to increase until such increasing pressure acting against the top wall causes the up wardly facing ledge surface to seal against a portion of the sealing surface on the container lip sufficient to prevent the escape of gas at high pressures.

## Description
This invention relates to a cap for sealing a container having contents from which gas dissociates therein. The invention also relates to a cap which is adapted to provide an opening in the container to gain access to the contents as well as seal the opening thereafter. The invention further relates to a cap in combination with a container end suitable for seal ing a container having contents from which gas dis sociates therein, and a method of making such can end. There has been a long felt need for a snap type cap which is effective for sealing and or resealing a container having a gas dissociating substance, such as a carbonated beverage, for example, packaged therein. When a beverage container is opened, gas in the space between the beverage and the container end referred to as head space is immediately lost, and gas which subsequently dissociates from the beverage escapes as well. Any gas loss has an effect on the level of carbonation in the beverage and excessive loss may make the beverage unacceptable. A cap suitable for sealing or resealing must be effective in sealing to make the container substantially gas tight, and it must also remain in sealing engagement at relatively high pressures. Since the level of carbonation from one beverage to another may vary substantially and internal pressure may also vary with other factors, such as temperature and head space above the beverage in the container, for example, it is not practical to establish a performance criteria for a beverage closure which will satisfy every potential use. Typically, however, a cap suitable for providing sub stantially gas tight sealing of a beverage container should be able to retain approximately 90 of the level of carbonation in the beverage at the time of sealing for a period of 24 hours at a pressure of up to approximately 50 psi and with the beverage at room temperature. Many attempts to solve the problem of gas tight sealing against such relatively high pressures with a snap type cap have been made as evidenced by the number of patents which are directed thereto. A large number of proposals have been made to incorporate a central stopper with the cap, whereby the stopper acts against an interior surface of the bottle neck to effect a seal. Examples of but a few of such patents are Salminen U.S. 3,209,934, Lovell U.S. 3,254,785, Lohrer U.S. 3,266,652, Lohrer U.S. 3,438,529, Sachau U.S. 3,528,091, Grussen U.S. 3,858,742, Beck U.S. 3,866,784, Aichinger et al U.S. 3,872,993 and Pirgov et al U.S. 3,994,410. A number of other patents describe stopperless caps which rely solely upon the hoop strength of the cap skirt surrounding the bottle mouth to provide a seal between the cap and bottle. Examples are Gelbjerg Hansen et al U.S. 3,247,993, Fuglsang Madsen et al U.S. 3,247,994 and Ruprecht U.S. 3,371,814. There has also been a long felt need for sealing the opening in a carbonated beverage can. Easy open ends as closures of carbonated beverage cans have become increasingly popular because their usage eliminates the need for a separate opener. A dis advantage, however, of many of the first embodiments of such closures is that the opening panel is a scored portion of the can end which is torn away and separated from the can by lifting and pulling on an attached tab. Careless discarding of the separated portion by users, particularly in public places, has contributed to an evergrowing liter problem, and a new generation of can ends commonly referred to as ecology ends has come into usage. The ecology ends, in general, feature an opening panel which is only partially severed from the end to provide an opening, and thus the panel remains attached to the can end. An example of such a can end is described in Heffner U.S. Patent 3,618,815 wherein V shaped panel in the can end is forced into the can by an opening tab which is attached to the can end, and the panel remains attached along the hinge line. An ever increasing share of the 12 oz. carbonated beverage market is being packaged in cans rather than bottles for such reasons as more efficient use of shelf, storage and shipping space per ounce of beverage packaged, savings in container cost, and savings in cost in packaging the beverage in the container. In addition, cans are lighter and are less susceptible to breakage than glass bottles and provide a package having a longer shelf life than does a plastic bottle. Furthermore, it is readily apparent to any purchaser of carbonated beverages, whether beer or soft drinks, that practically all present day 12 oz. size carbonated beverage cans feature an easy open can end. In spite of the above noted advantages of metal cans over bottles, threaded bottles have general ly been referred for carbonated beverage containers larger than 12 ounces because such beverages are usual ly consumed in quantities of less than 12 ounces at a time, and bottles having a threaded closure thereon have been better adapted for resealing to retain car bonation in the beverage than have metal cans. A variety of suggestions for providing a seal or reseal of a metal can end have been made. Ruskin U.S. Patent 3,664,541, for example, describes a resilient body that is adapted to plug a conventional opening in the can end that is, an opening made by lifting and pulling a tab connected to a portion of the can end defined by a score line. The end metal tears along the score line and the tab and weakened portion are then discarded, and Ruskin s device is used thereafter to seal the opening. Another suggestion for resealing a can end is provided in Balocca et al U.S. Patent 3,804,287. Balocca et al describes a can end having a dispensing aperture which is initially sealed with an adhesive patch adhered to the inner side of the end around the aperture. A resilient resealing member comprised of a plug on one end and a pull handle on the other end is disposed on the outside of the can end with the plug adhesively bonded to the sealing patch. When the handle is pulled, the patch portion defined by the periphery of the aperture is torn away to gain access to the container contents. The opening can then be resealed by pressing the plug downward into the aperture. The reseal is effected by an inter ference fit between the aperture edge and an upper portion of the plug which is larger in cross section than the aperture. It may be seen that in plug seals, such as those described in the aforementioned Ruskin and Balocca et al patents, an effective reseal is dependent upon the interaction between the plug and the single layer of metal in the can end defining the opening. In such a case, the force required to wedge the plug into the opening sufficiently to resist being blown out of the opening by the internal pressure within a carbonated beverage can must be at least as much as the blow out force generated by gas dissociating from the beverage. Since the blow out force in such a container can exceed 35 pounds, the plug may be difficult to insert, as well as remove when it is desired to gain access to the can contents. A combination opener reclosure device for a can end is described in Wells et al U.S. Patent 3,880,319. The device is movably attached to the can end and a plug portion is adapted to partially sever a flap defined by a line of weakness, such as a score line, for example, in the can end. With the opener plug properly positioned in relation to the line of weakness, downward pressure on the device causes rupture of the can end along the line of weakness and the flap is hinged inwardly into the can. The device is then removed from the opening to provide access to the can contents. If only a portion of the contents are consumed, and it is desired to reclose the end, the plug portion is again moved to position it above the opening, and the plug portion is forced into the opening by applying downward pressure. The foregoing examples describe but a few of the many proposals that have been made to provide an easy open can end which can be resealed or reclosed. A cap of the present invention includes a top wall, a skirt therearound, and a ledge projecting from the skirt. The cap is engaged with the container by positioning it over an opening in the container and applying downward pressure to effect a snap engagement between the ledge and a lip on the container around the opening. A portion of the skirt above the ledge is adapted to fit in interference with a peripheral portion of the lip sufficient to enable gas dissociating from a beverage, for example, to accumulate at a faster rate than it escapes and thereby establish a low pressure seal. As the pressure increases from the dissociating gases, it acts against interior surfaces of the cap and, in particular, the top wall. A resulting force from such pressure acts through the skirt upon the ledge to engage the ledge against the container lip to prevent the cap from blowing off and also provide an effective gas tight seal at high pressures in excess of the sealing limit of the initial low pressure seal. A cap of this invention may be adapted to pro vide an opening as well as seal such opening in an easy open can end. A cap of this invention may also be adapted for attachment to the container in a manner which enables selective manipulation of the cap to a position overlying the opening or to a position remote therefrom. It is an objective of this invention to provide an ecological container closure. It is an objective of this invention to pro vide means for effecting a substantially gas tight and liquid tight seal of a container after an opening has been made therein. It is also an objective of the invention to provide a container closure which can be opened without the need to use a separate opening device. It is an advantage of this invention that an end wall of the sealing means is adapted to flex out wardly from the effect of internal pressure and thereby provide noticeable visual evidence of an effective seal. It is also an advantage of this invention that the seal means is resistant against blow off from the con tainer from relatively high internal pressure, but the seal means can be applied to or removed from the open ing with the use of a relatively small user force. It is a further advantage of this invention that the seal means can be repeatedly applied and removed from the container opening without degrading the quality of the seal. It is also an objective of this invention that means for sealing an opening include means for effecting the opening in the container. It is also an objective of this invention that the opening means require the application of a minimal force by the user to effect an opening in the container. It is an advantage in using an opener means of this invention that the user s hand is protected against contact with sharp edges of the container opening and the risk of the user cutting his or her hand is thereby avoided. It is also an advantage in using this invention to effect an opening in a container that the spray of beverage which typically issues from the initial opening of a pressurized beverage container is captured or directed away from the user. It is also an advantage of this invention that is can be positioned with respect to the opening in the container to protect against a user s lip con tacting sharp edges of the opening when drinking from the container, and it is a further advantage that with the invention in such position free access of venting air is assured to thereby facilitate drinking from the container. These and other objects and advantages will be more apparent with reference to the following description of a preferred embodiment and accompanying drawings. For convenience, a preferred embodiment of a container closure of this invention will be described with reference to a can end closure, but it is to be understood that the invention may be used with other containers such as bottles or jars, for example. Where the words upwardly , downwardly , inwardly , outwardly , horizontal and the like are used hereinafter, their meaning is to be taken with reference to a can in an upright position having a cap of this invention attached to the top end thereof. Referring first to Figures 1 and 2, a cap of this invention 10 is shown attached to a can end closure 12 prior to the can end closure s engagement with a can body by double seaming. A preferred blank for making a can end closure 12 for use with a cap of this invention is shown in Figure 3. The can end blank 14 has a sub stantially flat end wall 16, a sidewall 17, flaring upwardly and outwardly from the peripheral edge of the end wall, and an annular flange 18 projecting upwardly and outwardly from the edge of the sidewall 17. An outwardly projecting step 19 intermediate the end wall 16 and annular flange 18 is provided in wall 17. The flange 18 is provided to attach the can end to a can body by double seaming. Referring again to Figures 1 and 2, an up wardly projecting spout 20 is provided adjacent an edge of the end wall 16. The spout 20 is shown as having a circular cross section, but it could also be oval, ellipsoidal or any other shape in cross section suitable for snap engagement of the cap, as will be described later. The spout 20 is an integrally formed portion of the end wall 16 and includes an upwardly projecting sidewall 22 and a top wall 24. A score line 26 in the top wall 24 interrupted by a hinge portion 28 defines an opening panel portion 27 which is pressed inwardly into the can by fracturing the score line. The score line 26 may be continuous to permit complete separation of the panel 27 from the can end, but this is not preferred from the ecology or safety standpoint as a completely severed panel might pass through the opening and be carelessly discarded or swallowed. An annular lip 30 projects outwardly from the side wall at the juncture of the sidewall and the top wall. The method of making the spout 20 and features of the spout just noted will be described in detail later. The cap 10 is preferably molded in one piece using a plastic material having a low modulus of elasticity, such as low density polyethylene, for example. The cap 10 is comprised of a seal portion 32, a pair of arms 34 angularly converging from the seal portion 32, and a tab 38 projecting outwardly from the seal portion 32 for convenience in manipulation of the cap. A strap 33 extends angularly from the arm 34 having the tab attached thereto to the seal portion to prevent caps from tangling during handling before attach ment to the can end. Alternatively to a pair of arms, a single arm of sufficient strength could also be used. The cap is pivotally attached to the end wall 16 with a rivet 36 through an opening at the junction of the arms 34. As shown in Figure 24, the converging arms 34 have an opening 35 to accommodate the rivet 36 and an annular ledge 39 on the bottom surface adjacent the opening to seat in a recess in the can end 16. An upper surface 41 sloping downwardly from the opening 35 into an annular recess 37 provides a lip 43 for engagement with the downwardly angled rivet flange 45, as shown in Figure 6. The rivet flange is formed downwardly a controlled amount with respect to the lip 43 when the rivet is staked to attach the cap to the can end to insure that there is engagement between the rivet and the arms 34 sufficient to maintain the seal portion 32 in a fixed position, but also permit the seal portion to be rotated by hand about the rivet with relative ease. Preferably, the rivet 36 is an integrally formed portion of the end wall 16. Referring now to Figures 4 and 5, the seal portion 32 of the cap 10 includes a top wall 40 and an outwardly flaring depending skirt 42. An annular lip 49 projects outwardly from the distal end of the skirt, and an annular wedge shaped ledge 44 projects inwardly from the skirt 42 near the distal end of the skirt to engage the spout lip 30, as will be discussed later. A small tab 51 projecting outwardly from the annular lip 49 is provided to assist in lifting the seal portion from the can end when positioning it over the spout, as will be discussed later. The top wall 40 includes a central disc portion 46 and an annular outer portion 48 with an annular groove 50 therebetween. The groove is defined by a substantially cylindrical outer wall 52 depending from the inner edge of the annular portion 48, an inner wall 54 flaring outwardly and downwardly from the central planar disc portion 46, and an annular bottom wall 56 connecting the ends of the outer and inner walls 52, 54. The tap 38 is com prised of a handle portion 62 having its upper surface coplanar with the upper surface of the cap top wall 40 and substantially vertical connector legs 60, 60 connecting one end of the handle to an arm 34 and connecting the other handle end to a bar 58 extending outwardly from the annular ledge. A lip 64 depends from the outer edge of the handle 62 for ease in gripping. Use of the invention will now be explained with reference to Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9. As has been noted heretofore, the cap 10 is attached to the can end 12 at a point spaced away from spout 20 by use of a rivet 36 and is positioned alongside the spout, as shown in Figure 1. The opening in the spout 20 can be made by using a finger, pencil or some other tool to press downward on the opening panel 27 adjacent the score line 26 to fracture the end along the score line and thereafter push the opening panel into the can. It is a feature of this preferred embodiment, however, that the seal portion 32 may be used to conveniently make the opening. To open a can having a cap of this invention applied thereto, the seal portion 32 is moved to the position shown in Figure 6 by inserting a finger or thumb nail under the lifting tab 51 not shown in Figure 6 and then lifting the seal portion and rotating the cap 10 about the riveted connection to clear the spout 20. The arms 34 flex so that the seal portion projects upwardly at an angle above the spout 20 with the sloped surface 66 of the ledge 44 resting on the lip 30 of the spout. To open the can using the opener means, pressure is initially applied downwardly on the seal portion 32 which then assumes the position shown in Figure 7 with the annular bottom wall 56 bearing against the spout opening panel 27 adjacent the score line 26. To initiate fracture of the score line 26, downward pressure is applied at any point along the annular groove 50 away from the hinge 28 however, the preferred point of initiating fracture is adjacent the hinge. The preferred point of applying pressure is near, but not on, the hinge since the amount of force required to initiate fracture at such a point is no greater than at any other point along the score line, and by applying pressure adjacent the hinge, the opening panel may be depressed inwardly to an adequate angle to dispense the container contents without the need for applying pressure to the central planar disc 46. Initial downward pressure brings the sloped surface 66 into contact with the spout lip 30 at the periphery thereof where the pressure is being applied and assists in aligning the seal portion 32 in the proper position over the spout with outer wall 52 adjacent to and concentric with score line 26, as may be seen in Figure 6. It is advantageous to align the outer wall adjacent to the score line because such position requires the least amount of force to initiate rupture of the score line. The advantage of using the seal portion 32 rather than the user using his or her finger to make the opening may also be noted with reference to Figure 7. Less downward force is required to initiate fracture of the score line because the force is con centrated adjacent the score line through the relatively rigid structure of wall 52 as compared to the relatively resilient meaty cushion on the user s fingertip. Furthermore, use of the seal portion protects the user from a finger cut in making the opening as well as containing or diverting away from the user the beverage spray issuing from the can at the initial point of fracture of the score line. After fracture has been initiated, further downward pressure along the groove and upon the central planar disc 46 causes severance along the score line to continue progressively from the point of initial fracture. As may be seen in Figure 8, application of downward pressure on the seal portion 32 causes the skirt 42 to spring outwardly as the sloped surface 66 of the ledge 44 slides along the peripheral edge of the spout lip 30. Concurrently the opening panel 27 is forced inwardly into the can. Com pletion of the opening cycle is shown in Figure 9 with the opening panel 27 extending into the can from the hinge 28 at an angle of approximately 75 from horizontal. It is noted, however, that for purposes of this invention, it is not essential that the opening panel 27 be extended inwardly to this extent. It has been determined that the can opening has satisfactory dispensing characteristics if the opening panel 27 is extended inwardly to at least a 45 angle from horizontal. Figure 9 also shows the seal portion 32 firmly engaged with the spout 20. The downward pressure on the seal portion 32 required to effect an opening, as just described, is less than the pressure required to engage the seal portion 32 with the spout 20. If excessive pressure is applied, however, the skirt 42 may be sprung and pushed downward to an extent that the skirt 42 snaps inwardly after the ledge 44 clears the lip 30, and in so doing, the ledge 44 becomes engaged with the lip 30. In the event that engagement of the seal portion 32 with spout 20 does occur, it can be easily disengaged by lifting tab 38 shown in Figs. 1 and 4 and rotating the seal portion away from the opening to gain access to the can contents. After dispensing a portion of the can contents, resealing of the can is readily accomplished by repositioning the seal portion 32 in an overlaying position over spout 20 and applying a downward pressure substantially uniformly across the top of the seal portion 32 to effect engagement with the spout 20. Engagement may be made with the greatest ease and least required force by applying downward pressure at a point or relatively small area adjacent the edge of the seal portion so as to concentrate the force necessary to spring only a relatively small segment of the skirt 42 outwardly and downwardly a distance for the ledge 44 to clear the spout lip 30. Assuming a thumb is used to apply the force, the thumb is then rolled and or moved progressively around the circumference of the cap until engagement is completed. The downward angle of inclination of the engaging ledge 44 is important for several reasons. In determining the optimal downward angle of inclination, consideration must be given to the effect of such angle on sealing characteristics of the cap, ease of disengagement of the cap from the spout, and the preferred method of molding the cap. It may be seen that when the seal portion 32 is engaged with the spout 20, as shown in Figure 15, entrapped gases within the can exert a force against the exposed surfaces and the engagement of the seal portion with the spout must be sufficient to resist this internal pressure. From the standpoint of insuring that the cap not be blown off the spout by such gases, it would be desirable that the ledge have no downward angle of inclination from horizontal or that such downward angle be minimal. Such an angle is not desirable, however, with respect to providing for ease in disengaging the cap from the spout or with respect to the preferred method of molding the cap. To disengage the sealing portion of the cap from the spout, tab 38 not shown in Figure 9 is grasped and lifted. Such lifting causes ledge 44 to slide along the bottom surface of spout lip 30 adjacent the line of connection between the tab and the seal portion 32. As lifting of tab 38 is continued, the ledge 44 is progressively disengaged from the spout 30. The greater the downward angle of inclination from horizontal of ledge 44, the less the force required to disengage the sealing portion from the spout and, therefore, the greater the ease in effecting dis engagement. For ease and economy of molding cap 10, it is also desirable to maximize the downward angle of inclination of ledge 44. It is preferable to mold a cap of this preferred embodiment with a mold referred to as a stripping mold. Such a mold includes two portions a female portion which is contoured to form all of the upper and exterior side surfaces of the cap, and a male portion which is contoured to form ali of the interior surfaces of the seal portion 32 and underlying surfaces of tab 38. In molding the cap, the two mold portions are brought together and there by define a cavity in the shape of the cap. After the mold is filled with plastic and the cap is formed, the female mold portion is separated from the cap and the cap remains engaged with the male portion by the ledge 44. The lesser the downward angle of inclination of ledge 44, the greater is the difficulty in stripping the cap from the mold without tearing at the base of the ledge. The optimal angle of inclination on the ledge 44, therefore, is one which is suitable for making the cap 10 in a stripping mold, which will provide sufficient holding and seal ing power when the seal portion 32 is engaged with the spout to retain it in engagement, and which will enable the cap to be disengaged with minimal applied force. As will now be explained, the maximum downward angle of inclination from horizontal of the ledge 44 on the cap as molded is controlled by the coefficient of friction between the engaging surfaces of the ledge 44 and the spout 20. In this preferred embodiment, the cap 10 is molded from low density polyethylene and the can end 12 is fabricated from aluminum allow 5182 H19 produced by Alcoa with an applied organic coating suitable for contacting a carbonated beverage. Other aluminum alloys may also be used in making the can end. The coefficient of friction between the above two materials is 0.36 and an angle having a tangent equal to 0.36 is 20 . Figure 10 illustrates features of the present invention which are important in providing a sub stantially gas tight and liquid tight seal. High pressure sealing engagement of the seal portion 32 with the spout 20 is dependent upon contact between the ledge 44 and the spout lip 30 at seal zone 70, and low pressure sealing is provided by hoop tension in the skirt 42 compressing an interior portion of the skirt against the spout lip 30 in an initial seal zone 68. The underside of lip 30 projects outwardly from the spout sidewall 22 at a substantially 90 angle and the ledge 44 is inclined downward at an angle of 15 from horizontal. Although an angle of 20 is satisfactory to prevent blow off, this preferred embodiment is molded with a 15 downwardly inclined ledge angle to provide a safety factor of 5 rotational elastic deflection before any unbalanced disengaging force arises. It is also noted that with the ledge inclined at 15 the cap can be readily made in a stripping mold. Contact between the ledge 44 and the lip 30 occurs along a line or narrow zone of tangency 70 which provides a seal zone against the ultimate high pressures which may develop in the con tainer. Providing such initial low pressure and high pressure seal zones is important to insure that a substantially gas tight and liquid tight seal of a carbonated beverage is attained. The skirt 42 has an inside diameter slightly less than the outside diameter of the spout lip 30 in order to compress the skirt in the initial seal zone 68. After initial engagement of sealing portion 32 with the spout 20, escaping gas dissociating from the carbonated beverage causes pressure within the can to steadily increase. Such pressure is first resisted by hoop tension in the skirt 42 which causes the skirt to compress against the lip 30 in the initial seal zone 68. It is not essential that the seal in the initial seal zone be absolute. It is important, however, if gas does escape through the initial seal zone, that the seal be sufficient to ensure that the escape of gas is at a slower rate than it dissociates from the beverage so that pressure can build in the container to effect a high pressure seal. As internal pressure increases due to the initial seal, such pressure operates against the interior of the seal portion 32 to lift it from the spout. Thus, the ledge 44 becomes pressed more tight ly against the spout lip in the high pressure seal zone 70 as the interior pressure increases. At a pressure of about 15 psi, contact between the ledge and spout lip is sufficiently tight to insure a sub stantially gas tight seal, and the initial seal is no longer required. By providing the high pressure seal zone 70 independent of the initial seal zone 68, the skirt 42 can be adapted to require a minimal amount of compression for a low pressure seal which is advan tageous in making the seal portion relatively easy to engage and disengage from the spout. It has also been found that a lubricant in the initial seal zone improves the initial seal. A suitable lubricant, such as paraffin wax, may be applied by dipping the cap in a wax bath. Alternatively, the lubricant can be added to the molding compound prior to mold ing, in which case the lubricant blooms to the surface after molding. The importance of the downward inclination of the ledge 44 with respect to horizontal may be seen with reference to the vector drawings shown in Figures 11, 12 and 13 which show force vectors acting on seal portion 32 and lip 30 surfaces, as shown in Figure 10, in the high pressure seal zone 70 with the ledge 44 at varying downward angles of inclination with respect to horizontal. In each of Figures 11, 12 and 13, the vector notations have the following meanings Load represents the force applied by the ledge 44 against the spout lip 30 as a result of internal pressure. Normal represents the component of the Load force acting normal to the ledge. Removal represents the component of the Load force acting parallel with the surface of the ledge and urging disengagement of the ledge from the lip. Frictional represents the force acting in opposition to the removal force and is the product of the coefficient of friction between the lip and ledge materials and the Normal force. In Figure 11, the vectors are shown as applied to ledge 44 inclined downward at an angle of 20 with respect to horizontal in assembly with spout lip 30. At 20 , which is the angle having a tangent equal in value to the coefficient of friction between the spout lip 30 and ledge 44 of 0.36, the Removal force is equal to the Frictional force. The frictional force, therefore, is sufficient to prevent the ledge from disengaging from the spout. In Figure 12, the vectors are shown as applied to a ledge 44 having a downward angle of inclination from horizontal of 15 , which angle has a tangent of 0.27. The Removal vector is less than the Frictional vector, and the ledge, therefore, can undergo 5 of rotational elastic deflection under load and the frictional force will still be sufficient to prevent the ledge from disengaging from the spout. In Figure 13, the vectors are shown as applied to a ledge having a downward angle of in clination with respect to horizontal of 30 , which angle has a tangent of 0.58. The Removal vector is greater than the Frictional vector and, thus, the frictional force is not sufficient to prevent dis engagement of the ledge from the spout. It is noted that when the frictional force is not sufficient to prevent disengagement such as shown in Figure 13, disengagement of the cap from the spout might be prevented by increasing the hoop strength in the cap skirt. Increasing the hoop strength, however, necessitates increasing the stiffness of the skirt and, even if it were possible to develop sufficient hoop strength to prevent disengagement, greater force would be required to engage or disengage the cap with the spout. Thus, if the tangent of the downward angle of inclination from horizontal of the ledge is equal to or less than the coefficient of friction between the ledge and spout lip materials, the frictional force alone will retain the ledge in engagement with the spout lip. Utilization of frictional force alone to maintain the cap in engagement with the container permits the hoop tensile stiffness of the skirt to be no greater than that necessary to provide a low pressure seal and the cap can be easily engaged and disengaged with the container. In order to maximize the utilization of frictional force between the cap ledge and spout lip to maintain a cap of this invention in engagement with the container, the seal portion 32 of a cap of this invention is adapted to bulge substantially outwardly as internal pressure increases. As will now be dis cussed, such bulging causes the angle of inclination of the ledge from horizontal to decrease as the pressure increases and, thus, utilization of frictional force is maximized. Referring first to Figure 14, the seal portion 32 is shown as applied to the spout 20 before internal pressure in the container begins to increase from dissociating gas. As has previously been dis cussed, the inside diameter of the skirt 42 is sized to be less than the outside diameter of the spout lip 30 an amount sufficient to generate an interference fit and sufficient hoop tension in the skirt to effect an initial seal. As gases dissociate from the beverage, top wall portions of the seal portion 32 begin to bulge upwardly, as shown in Figure 15, from increasing internal pressure until the maximum effect from the pressure is realized by causing the walls 52, 54 defining the groove 50 to spread and thereby at least partially flatten the wall structure defining the groove. As a result of such bulging, skirt 42 and ledge 44 rotate inwardly, as indicated by the arrow, decreasing the angle of inclination from horizontal and maximizing the utilization of the frictional force in preventing blow off of the cap. Although not intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed that a cap of this invention having a top wall adapted to substantially bulge under pressure has improved resistance to blow off as compared to a cap having a substantially flat wall for reasons which follow. Referring to Figure 36, the portion of the figure on the left of the center line represents a seal portion 32 having a top wall 40 adapted to substantially bulge under pressure when the seal portion is in sealing engagement with a container having internal pressure therein. The portion of the figure on the right of the centerline is a seal portion 32 identical in all respects to seal portion 32 except for having a substantially flat top wall which is not adapted to substantially bulge under pressure. Seal portion 32 is shown in sealing engagement with a container identical to the container shown on the left of the centerline and is subject to the identical pressure as is seal portion 32. Both seal portions 32, 32 are made from an identical plastic compound having a low modulus of elasticity approximately 20,000 psi and the top wall 40, 40 of each is relatively thin approximately .020 inch . Although the top walls of each are thin, the walls are of sufficient thickness to withstand anticipated internal pressures without developing unit stresses in excess of the elastic limit of the plastic from which they are made. Referring first to the portion of the figure to the right of the centerline, vector P represents the vertical component of the total force acting against the top wall 40 from the internal pressure within the container. Although the pressure acts uniformly across the surface of the top wall, vector P is shown as a single line acting at the center of the wall for convenience of discussion. The horizontal component of the force is not shown since such com ponent has a relatively small value and has practically no effect on the blow off resistance of the cap. Since the top wall 40 is relatively thin and has a low modulus of elasticity, it has low bending stiffness and primarily resists the force of vector P in tension. It also bulges upwardly from its unpressurized position shown as dashed lines to assume a slightly arcuate domed position. Although the tension force resisting the force of vector P acts through the slightly arcuate top wall, it is shown as a straight line vector T₂ acting along approximate centerline b b for con venience, and such showing can be made without intro ducing any appreciable error. As internal pressure increases, P and T₂ likewise increase until the highest anticipated internal pressure is reached. At such highest anticipated internal pressure, top wall 40 and vector T₂ will have rotated through angle A₂ and, according to principles of static equilibrium, T₂ will have a magnitude which will provide a vertical component equal to P. It is evident that a sub stantially flat top wall, such as top wall 40 , will rotate through a relatively small angle A₂ from the application of internal pressure, and as a consequence, the tension T₂ in the top wall will be relatively large. In contrast, the seal portion 32 to the left of the centerline in Figure 36 will substantially bulge under the identical highest anticipated pressure and will rotate from the position shown in dashed lines through a relatively large angle A₁ before reaching a position of static equilibrium. Because angle A₁ is substantially larger than angle A₂, tension force T₁ in top wall 40 acting along approximate centerline a a is substantially less than tension force T₂ in top wall 40 . The effect of the relatively large differences in magnitude between T₁ and T₂ and angles A₁ and A₂ with respect to blow off resistance may be seen with reference to Figures 37 and 38. Figure 37 shows the skirt portion of the seal portion shown on the right hand side of the centerline of Figure 36 as a free body and the forces acting upon it. The tension force T₂ is resisted by a force T₄ of equal magnitude and acting parallel to T₂ at point O₂ which is the point of tangency between the ledge 44 and spout lip 30. Tension force T₂ acting in a plane spaced away from point O₂ by the distance L₂ produces a force couple C₂ acting in a counterclockwise direction and having a magnitude determined by multiply ing the amount of force T₂ by the length of moment arm L₂. The effect of force couple C₂ is to tend to rotate the ledge in a counterclockwise rotation in creasing its angle of inclination with respect to horizontal and thereby decreasing its resistance to blow off. The slight doming or bulging of the top wall tends to rotate the ledge in a clockwise direction to offset the counterclockwise rotation caused by the couple C₂. The clockwise direction rotation, however, is a function of the vertical component of the internal pressure acting on top wall 40 that has rotated through the angle A₂ and, because of the relatively small value of angle A₂, there is negligible resistance to counterclockwise rotation of the ledge. Referring now to Figure 38 which is the skirt portion of the seal portion to the left of the centerline in Figure 36 shown as a free body, tension force T₁ is resisted by opposite force T₃ of identical magnitude acting at point O₁. The plane of action of force T₁ is offset from point O₁ a distance L₁ which is equal to the offset distance L₂ for the seal portion to the right of the centerline. A force couple C₁ rotating in a clockwise direction equal in magnitude to the product of T₁ and length L₁ is generated by forces T₁ and T₃ Since T₁ is substantially smaller than T₂, force couple C₁ is shown with substantially thinner lines than the couple C₂ to indicate the relative difference in magnitude between the two. In the case of the cap seal portion 32 shown on the left of the centerline, force couple C₁ acts to tend to rotate ledge 44 clockwise so as to increase the angle of inclination with horizontal and thereby decrease its resistance to blow off just as force couple C₂ does on seal portion 32 . Such tendency to rotate clockwise is offset, however, by the vertical component of the total force of the internal pressure acting against top wall 40 which is rotated through angle A₁. It may be seen that if the bulging of top wall 40 is sufficient, the tendency for counter clockwise rotation of ledge 44 will be greater than the tendency for clockwise rotation and the ledge will be rotated counterclockwise and increased resistance to blow off will be provided thereby. From the foregoing, it may be seen that as the ability to bulge under pressure of the top wall of a seal portion of a cap of this invention increases, the greater is the force acting on the skirt to rotate the ledge inwardly and the less is the magnitude of the force couple tending to rotate the ledge outwardly with the net effect being to improve the blow off resistance of the cap. Thus, providing sufficient bulging of the top wall of a cap of this invention enhances the maintenance of a high pressure seal of the gas within the container. It is evident, however, that a cap having a particular top wall thickness and skirt and ledge structure will ultimately blow off at some internal pressure. As the internal pressure increases and the top wall becomes bulged to its limit within the elastic limit of the plastic material, the tension force T₁ increases as well. The angle A₁ remains unchanged with increasing pressure after the top wall has reached its bulging limit, but the lifting force working through the skirt wall steadily increases and finally becomes so great as to cause bending or deformation of the skirt and ledge structure in the area of their juncture. As a consequence, the angle of inclination of the ledge with horizontal is increased, and when it exceeds an angle having a tangent equal to the coefficient of friction between the ledge and container lip materials, the cap will disengage from the container lip and blow off. As has been noted earlier, a cap capable of sealing at pressures up to 50 psi will usually be satisfactory for sealing carbonated beverages. Some beverages, however, may develop internal pressures up to 100 psi, in which case it may become necessary to strengthen the skirt and ledge junction to function satisfactorily at such higher pressure. In general, it is preferred to make the skirt and ledge structure no stronger or rigid than necessary to withstand the anticipated internal pressure for ease in engaging and disengaging the cap with the container lip. Making the top wall portions of the seal portion 32 sufficiently thin to bulge under pressure also pro vides the added advantage of minimizing the amount of material required to make the cap and provides readily visible evidence of a satisfactory seal of the con tainer. A further advantage is that the cap can be molded with the ledge 44 having an optimal downward angle of inclination for molding purposes since the angle decreases from the effect of internal pressure. After seal portion 32 is disengaged, the top wall 24 will typically again assume its as molded shape, although temperature, amount of pressure and the length of time the seal portion is subject to the pressure will affect the recovery to its original shape. If, for example, the seal portion were engaged with a container having a relatively high internal pressure for an extended period of time at a relatively high temperature, the seal portion might not return to its original shape after disengagement without additional manipulation by hand to promote its return. Certain features of the spout 20 of a pre ferred embodiment of a can end for use with a cap of this invention are important and will now be discussed with reference to Figure 16. The spout opening panel 27 is inwardly concave and includes a central portion 72 and a ring portion 74 of a thinner thickness extend ing therefrom. The preferred line of weakness 26 is made by scoring in a manner described in Jordan U.S. Patent 3,997,076 which is hereby incorporated by by reference. The concave opening panel combined with such a score line is preferred because internal pressure within the can acting against the concave panel puts the metal in the line of weakness 26 in compression which provides maximal resistance to rupture from internal pressure, but the score line can be easily ruptured by the application of an external force adjacent thereto to gain access to the container content. The spout lip 30 is com prised of a top wall 76 extending from the scored line 26 at a slightly downward angle from horizontal approximately 15 25 and is connected with a sub stantially horizontal bottom wall 78 underlying the top wall by an arcuate outer wall 80. Anti fracture score 29 is a coined zone adjacent the line of weaken ing 26 which is provided to control stresses produced in forming the line of weakening. The spout sidewall 22 projecting upwardly from the end wall 16 of the can end is connected to the bottom wall 78 of the lip by a second arcuate portion 82. It is noted that the wall thicknesses of the lip portions 76, 78 and 80 and the second arcuate portion 82 are reduced in thickness relative to the thickness of the can end wall and the thickness of the spout sidewall. The relatively thin wall is desirable for the purpose of forming the arcuate connecting walls 80 and 82 with a minimal radius. Locating the point of transition from the relatively thicker sidewall 22 to the thinner arcuate portion 82 just below arcuate portion 82 controls the location of and assists in minimizing the radius of arcuate portion 82. Controlling the thickness, length and locations of bottom wall 78 and of arcuate portions 80 and 82 is desirable to insure that lower wall 78 of lip 30 projects outwardly from spout sidewall 22 at a substantially 90 angle, as will be discussed later. Lip 30 is adapted to maximize the sealing performance provided by the seal portion. The arcuate portion 80 is provided with a minimal radius to take advantage of the smooth surface of the sheet for the sealing surface and also to minimize the area of sealing contact so as to maximize the unit pressure in the seal area. Maximizing the unit pressure in the initial seal area by providing a minimal radius on the lip is important so that the degree of interference fit between the cap and the lip can be minimized. The less the interference fit required to attain an effective initial seal, the greater the ease in applying and removing the cap from the spout. By thinning the metal to form the lip, the radius of the arcuate portion 80 can be minimized and unit pressure in the seal zone can be maximized and thereby attain enhanced seal security. The arcuate portion 80 presents a substantially smooth surface for the plastic cap surfaces to slide against during application and removal with no degradation of the seal quality or blowoff resistance. The plastic sealing surfaces are therefore not cut, scraped or otherwise damaged during application and removal. This is in contrast to some of the prior teachings noted heretofore which describe sealing against sheared edges, or edges of a fractured score. Sealing against such edges will produce high unit pressure in the seal area because of low contact area, but such edges are very sharp and may cut or scrape the plastic seal ing surfaces and thus degrade seal quality. Thinning the metal to reduce the size of the seal radius has the further advantage of decreasing the required inward extent of cap ledge 44 to insure that seal portion 32 engages with the spout lip 30 and that the high pressure sealing zone 70 is positioned on the downwardly inclined portion of ledge 44. The larger the radius of arcuate section 80, the greater is the required inward extent of ledge 44 to effect engagement. As the required inward extent of the ledge increases, the greater the difficulty of applying and removing the snap cap with no improvement in seal performance or blowoff resistance. Thinning the metal in arcuate portion 82 and terminating the thinned section just below arcuare portion 82 reduces the size of the radius required for forming and causes arcuate section 82 to occur just above the unreduced section. This combination, along with control of the thickness, length and location of underside wall 78 and arcuate portion 80, causes underside wall 78 of the lip to form at a substantial ly 90 angle to sidewall 22 of the spout. Use of a controlled amount and location of thinning is important to control the shape of the lip during forming, as will be discussed later. The spout 20 is formed in five stages the first four as shown in Figures 17, 18, 19, and 20 form the spout to a desired height and diameter and partially form the spout lip, and then a final stage as shown in Figure 21 finishes forming the lip and scoring the spout end wall 24 by using the method described in previously incorporated by reference U.S. Patent 3,997,076. Forming of the can end will be described with reference to making a 209 can end, a typical size for packaging carbonated beverages, but the method of forming hereafter described is not limited to any particular size of can end. In a first forming stage shown in Figure 17, a can end blank 14, as shown in Figure 3, of a preferred aluminum alloy 5182 H19 produced by Alcoa having a nominal thickness of .0115 inch is inserted into a press between spaced apart forming dies which are in coaxial alignment and at least one die is adapted for coaxial movement relative to the other. A first die 84 has a dome shaped forming surface 86, and the opposing second die 88 has an annular arcuate forming surface 90. Die or dies 84, 88 are moved relative to one another to a closed position, as shown in Figure 17, to form the metal in the end wall 16 into an initial bubble 92. The location of the initial bubble 92 in this first forming step is important in making this preferred embodiment. A relatively large amount of metal is required to form the finished spout, so it is desirable to form the largest bubble possible consistent with the final dimensions of the can end closure. For ease of pouring or drinking beverage from the container, it is also desirable that the spout have as large an opening as possible and that the spout, as finally formed, be positioned as closely as possible to the edge of the can. By reference to Figures 1 and 2, it may be seen that the spout and the seal portion 32 of the cap 10 fit side by side on the panel end wall 16 and thus the sum of the spout diameter and the outermost diameter of the seal portion 32 plus the extent of the tab 38 must be less than the diameter of the end wall 16. In addition, clearance between the spout and the widewall 17 of the can end panel 14 must be provided to accommodate a chuck that is used in double seaming the can end to the can. For a 209 can, it has been determined that the distance from the axis of the can end blank 14 to the center line of the bubble 92 should be at least .529 inch, and using the aforesaid parameters to locate the bubble 92 on the can end 16, the bubble is formed as shown in Figure 17 as high as possible and as close as possible to the upwardly flaring can end blank sidewall 17. During the second forming stage, as shown in Figure 18, the can end blank 14 having the bubble 92 thereon is further formed to add additional height to the bubble and reform the bubble to a shape intermediate the final spout shape. The blank 14, as formed in Figure 17, is inserted into a forming press between a second pair of coaxially aligned spaced apart forming dies 94, 96 with at least one die adapted for axial movement relative to the other. To the right of the centerline in Figure 18, dies 94 and 96 are shown in the initial forming position, die 94 having moved relative to the bubble 92 shown in Figure 17 to reform the bubble. Dies 94 and 96 are then moved relative to each other squeezing can end wall material between them to coin a portion thereof and further reform the bubble as shown to the left of the center line. The male die 94 has an arcuate forming surface 98 to stretch the bubble during the initial interaction between the forming dies to a shape conforming to the male die forming surface. The female die 96 has a frustoconical forming surface 100 to interact with the male die 94 to coin a portion of the reformed bubble and increase its height. A slight depression 99 is provided in the frustoconical forming surface of die 96 to prevent excessive thinning of a zone which will later be formed into the bottom wall 78 of the lip 30 as shown in Figure 16. Referring now to the left side of the center line in Figure 18, dies 94 and 96 are shown at the com pletion of their relative movement with resepct to each other. It may be seen that as can end wall material is compressed between the arcuate forming surface 98 of die 94 and the frustoconical forming surface 100 of die 96, the depression 99 fills with end wall metal, and metal adjacent to the depression is coined. The coined metal 101 below the depression will later be formed into the second arcuate lip portion 82 Figure 16 and the coined metal 102 above the depression will be formed into the first arcuate lip portion 80 Figure 16 . The proper positioning of the coined metal in this area is important in attaining the final shape of the spout lip later. Metal that is displaced in the coined area 102 is extruded upwardly causing the reformed bubble 92 of Figure 17 to be raised from the surface of die 94 and increase the height of the intermediate formed spout. The coined metal 102 produced in this second forming stage has controlled zones of thickness varying from approximately .0050 to .0055 inch and its proper positioning and length is important to provide coined metal which will sub sequently be formed into the spount lip. Coining further contributes to increasing the height of the intermediate spout shape. It is preferable that the coining be accomplished with the female die 96 because it is important that die 94 have a precise contour and smooth forming surface to accomplish the desired amount of stretching that occurs before coining without causing tensile fracture of the bubble. It is also preferable to coin with the female die 96 to avoid the possibility of damage to the organic coating which is present on the interior surface of the end wall 16 of the blank. The third forming stage, as shown in Figure 19, further reforms the spout to its final outside diameter, exclusive of the lip which is formed later. In addition, an annular groove 104 is formed at the junction of the can end wall 16 with the sidewall 17. Can ends typically include such an annular groove to increase the resistance of the end against buckling from internal pressure. In the usual practice of making a can end, the groove is formed concurrently with forming the end blank from a sheet blank. In making a can end of this invention, however, it is preferable to delay forming the groove until this or a subsequent stage in order that the spout can be located as close as possible to the chime on the finished can. As has been noted heretofore, it is desirable to form the initial bubble as large as possible, and forming the bubble and spout before form ing the groove permits gathering metal from the area to be occupied by the groove to form the bubble as closely as possible to the sidewall 17 of the can end and there by position the spout as closely as possible to the can chime. At the beginning of the third stage in form ing the spout, the formed blank as shown on the left side of centerline in Figure 18 is inserted into a press between upper and lower support rings 106, 108 which pinch outwardly projecting step 19 therebetween. Coaxially aligned, spaced apart dies 110, 112, with at least one die adapted for axial movement relative to the other, are then brought together. The male die 110 has a substantially planar forming surface 114 and a substantially cylindrical projection 116, projecting upward therefrom to assist in forming the interior of the spout to its finished inside dimensions. The female die 112 has a substantially planar forming surface 118, an annular ridge 120 for forming groove 104 to an inside radius of approximately .030 inch, and a cylindrical recess 122 to cooperate with the male die features in forming the can end having a spout there in. Figure 19 shows dies 110, 112 in a closed position at the end of this third forming stage. It is noted that during this forming stage the reformed bubble is substantially flattened with the coined metal zone 102 positioned so as to be subsequently formed into the spout lip. The fourth stage in forming the spout, as shown in Figure 20, partially forms the outwardly pro jecting lip 30 around the periphery of the spout. The formed can end blank, as shown in Figure 19, is inserted between coaxially aligned spaced apart ring dies 125, 127 which are adapted to hold the formed can end between the dies in the flange area. Central die portions 124, 126 are shown in a closed position and are adapted for vertical movement relative to one another. The male die 124 functions as a support tool having a cylindrical support portion 128 projecting up wardly from the die face. Female die 126 includes a cylindrical recess 130 having a cylindrical side surface 134 with an inside diameter slightly greater than the spout diameter in order to partially form the lip. A coining ring 132 extends inwardly from the cylindrical side surface 134. This ring coins the metal in the spout end wall and extrudes metal radially outwardly from the spout to partially form the lip 30. Figure 20 shows the dies 124, 126 in a closed position after this partial lip forming stage has been completed. As the dies 124, 126 come together, the coining ring 132 contacts the end wall of the flattened bubble to reduce the metal thickness in the coined area to a thickness of approximately .007 inch and extrude metal radially outwardly and thereby partially form lip 30. In this, the fourth stage of forming the spout, the annular groove 104 which was formed in the third stage is reformed to a smaller radius of approximately .016 inch. The groove was not formed to this smaller radius in one step to reduce the danger of fracturing the metal in the groove area if a single forming step was used. The smaller radius is advantageous because a thicker guage of metal would be required to resist buckling from equivalent internal pressure if the groove were not reformed to the smaller radius. Figure 21 illustrates the fifth stage of form ing the spout which forms the lip to its final shape and dimension and scores the end wall. It also illustrates the advantage of reducing the thickness of the metal in the lip as much as is practically possible. The spout, before forming, is shown in dashed lines and, as has previously been noted in dis cussing the second forming stage, the coined metal 102 has controlled zones of varying thicknesses to enable forming the lip 30. The metal in area 102 which is formed into arcuate sections 80 and 82 is thinner than the metal which is formed into relatively straight sections 76 and 78 and that which is to be formed into arcuate section 80 is thinner than that to be formed into arcuate section 82 to insure that a desired small radius is formed at 80. To finish forming the spout and score the spout end wall, the can end blank as formed in the fourth forming stage is positioned on a support die 221 having an upwardly extending portion 220 with a diameter suitable to fit within the spout. As shown by dashed lines, the upper portion of the partially formed spout extends above the up wardly extending portion 220 of the support die. The upper die is comprised of a central cylinder 222 and circumscribing ring 224. The dies in Figure 21 are shown in a closed position, but at the beginning of this final forming stage, dies 222 and 224 are in a raised position spaced apart from the can end blank. Opposing faces of die 222 and the upstanding portion 220 of the support die are contoured to form the score line 26 and form the opening panel 27 with a controlled degree of inward concavity. The outer ring die 224 has a die face 225 sloping downwardly and outwardly to form the upper spout lip wall 76 downwardly. At the inner edge of the outer ring die face, an annular bead 226 projects outwardly from the die face to form the anti fracture score 29 in the spout top wall 24. Dies 222 and 224 function as a single unit but are made as separate elements so that the opening score and anti fracture score can be set up separately and for con venience in making and maintaining the dies. From their raised position, dies 222 and 224 are moved downwardly as a single unit. As the die faces contact the partially formed spout shown as dashed lines, the spout is pressed downward and the partially formed lip portion begins to bend at desired sites for proper forming of the lip. As previously noted, the metal in area 102 is thinner than spout wall 22 and that which forms arcuate sections 80, 82 is thinner than that which forms straight section 78 to insure that the metal bends at desired points. Furthermore, the metal which forms arcuate section 80 is thinner than that which forms section 82 to insure that the desired small radius forms at section 80 before wall section 78 is bent below horizontal. If the metal to form section 82 doesn t have higher bending strength than that which forms section 80, section 82 metal will form pre ferentially and the section 80 metal will not form to the desired small radius. Since metal will bend where bending strengths are the least, by proper proportioning the thicknesses of the metal and the length of portions having different thicknesses, the lip can be formed to project outwardly at a substantial ly 90 angle from the spout and with a minimal radius on the arcuate sealing surface. As shown in Figure 22, a slight modification of support die 221 and ring die 224 enables producing a spout lip 30 having a bottom wall 78 projecting outwardly from the spout at less than a 90 angle. The modification comprises altering the slope of cooperating die faces 223 and 225 so that spout top wall 76 and bottom wall 78 are bent downwardly the desired degree. In the foregoing description, scoring of the spout end wall is accomplished by use of the method described in U.S. Patent 3,997,076 because such a score line combined with the downwardly concave opening panel minimizes the amount of force required to effect separation of the opening panel from the spout end wall. Other known methods of scoring including pro viding a score line on either the inner or outer surface of the wall to be scored, for example, may be used in a can end for use with a cap of this invention, although use of such a less preferred score line may require a greater force to effect a separation of the opening panel from the can end. If a score line requiring a greater force to effect separation of the opening panel from the end wall is employed, it may be desirable to provide seal portion 32, as shown in Figure 23. In this embodiment, a boss 140 is provided which projects downwardly from the seal portion bottom wall 56. The boss may have any suitable cross section, such as cylindrical or triangular, for example, and is pre ferably located on the bottom wall 56 at a point that is at a minimum of 30 from the unscored hinge 28 when the seal portion 32 is positioned over the spout. Addition of the boss is useful to initiate severance of the opening panel along the score line by providing a concentration of the downward force in the boss area. The seal portion, as shown in cross section in Figure 23, is identical to that shown in Figures 4 and 5 except for the boss 140 and that in Figure 23 the bottom wall 56 is disposed closer to the top of the seal portion 32 by a distance equal to the thickness of the boss. In use of this just described alternate embodiment of the seal portion, the cap is attached to the can end wall and the seal portion 32 positioned over the spout as has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment. When downward pressure is applied along the groove 50 above the boss 140 to effect opening of the can, the boss 140 is the first portion of the seal portion to contact the spout opening panel and the downward force is concentrated over the cross sectional area of the boss to initiate severance of the opening panel. Thereafter, the bottom wall 56 contacts the opening panel adjacent the score line and continued application of pressure ruptures the scored metal causing the opening panel to be bent downward into the can about the opening panel hinge. Although it is preferred that the spout be integral with the container end, the spout may be made as a separate piece and assembled with the container end. For example, Figure 39 shows a spout 20 molded of a suitable plastic, such as polypropylene or polyethylene material. The spout is a molded hollow cylindrical tube having a sidewall 22 , an outwardly projecting annular lip 30 for engagement with the sealing portion 32 of a cap of this invention, and an annular groove 23 near the bottom end of the sidewall for a snap engagement in an opening in the container end wall 16. The slope of the underlying surface 78 of the spout lip 30 and the slope of the engaging ledge 44 of the cap seal portion 32 are determined by the coefficient of friction between the plastic cap material and the plastic spout material. The seal portion ledge angle with respect to horizontal when the seal portion is engaged with the spout must not be greater than an angle having a tangent equal to the coefficient of friction between the two materials in order to maintain the cap in sealing engagement. As a consequence, the downward angle of the underlying lip surface 78 with respect to horizontal must also be an angle no greater than an angle having a tangent equal to the coefficient of friction between the sealing portion and spout materials. In this embodiment, the spout is molded as a hollow cylinder and an end closure must be provided, therefore, when the container is filled. One method of accomplishing an initial seal of the container is to utilize the seal portion 32 by positioning it as shown in Figure 39 and then apply a rupturable overlay at the junction of the seal portion and the spout. Overlays that might be used, for example, are an adhesive tape or heat shrink plastic collar, either of which could be applied so as to cover the seam between the seal portion and the spout. If the seal portion 32 were adapted so as to have a flat top wall 40 without the annular groove 50, a heat seal foil disc having sufficient strength and adhesive properties could be applied to the spout opening with the seal portion 32 applied thereover to protect the integrity of the foil disc. In yet another embodiment as shown in Figure 40, the spout 20 could be molded with a closed end top wall 24 having a molded line of weakening 26 there around. A tab 25 projecting upwardly from a portion of the top wall 24 adjacent to the score line 26 is provided to effect an opening. By lifting and pulling on the tab 25 , the central portion of the top wall defined by the score line 26 can be separated from the spout and discarded. Another important feature of a preferred embodiment of a can end for use with a cap of this invention is the use of the integrally formed rivet 36 shown in Figure 6. The rivet is formed by successive coining steps. A first coining step is shown at its com pletion in Figure 25. At the beginning of the step, can end wall 16 is disposed between spaced apart coining die 144 and support die 146. Coining die 144 has an annular coining surface 148 around a central opening 150 with the coining surface having a .120 inch I.D. and .260 inch 0.D. Support die 146 has a planar support surface 152. The coining die and support die are adapted for axial movement of one with respect to the other. The dies are then brought together. The end wall is reduced in thickness in the first coined zone 154. Metal displaced therefrom is extruded radially inwardly to form the bubble 142 and outward ly to spring upwardly a portion of the end wall 16 adjacent the exterior of coining die 144. The completion of the second coining step is shown in Figure 26. The shape formed in Figure 25 is first placed between support die 156 and spaced apart hold down tool 158 and coining die 164. Hold down tool 158 and coining die 164 are adapted for axial movement independent of one another. Support die 156 has a planar support surface 160 and hold down tool 158 is cylindrical with an annular planar end surface 162. The hold down tool is moved axially toward support die 156 with a portion of the upwardly sprung portion of the can end wall 16 therebetween to hold down and flatten such portion. Second coining die 164 having a central opening 166 and an annular coining surface 168 with a .270 inch I.D. and a .370 inch 0.D. there around is then moved axially downward to coin and thin the wall in a second coined zone 170. The second coined zone is outward of the first coined zone 154, and since end wall 16 outward of the second zone is held down and restrained from movement, the metal displaced from the second coined zone is extruded radially inwardly pushing the first coined zone 154 and bubble 142 upwardly. In the third and final coining step, the height of the bubble 142 and first coined zone 154 is further increased and a recess is formed in the end wall adjacent the upwardly formed wall portion to pro vide a seat for a cap of this invention. Figure 27 shows the tooling and end wall at the completion of the final coining step. To perform such step, the formed shape shown in Figure 26 is positioned between cylindrical hold down tool 172 and coining die 186 spaced apart from support tool 174. Hold down tool 172 and coining die 186 are adapted for axial move ment independent of one another. Support tool 174 has a planar support surface 176, and hold down tool 172 has an annular planar end surface 178. The interior corner 180 of the hold down tool is radiused to provide an upwardly projecting ridge 182 in the end wall 16 adjacent the coined recess 184. The hold down tool 172 is moved axially toward the support die 174 to hold the formed shape therebetween. Coining die 186 having a central opening 188 and an annular coining surface 190 with a .200 inch I.D. and a .280 inch 0.D. therearound is moved axially against the end wall metal to coin and thin the metal therebelow and thereby form recess 184. The metal displaced by coining the recess is primarily extruded radially inwardly to further in crease the height of the bubble 142 and first coined zone 154. A small portion of the displaced metal is extruded radially outwardly, however, to fill the void between the radiused hold down tool corner 180 and the coining die 186 and thereby form the ridge 182. As finally formed, the bubble section 142 has the same thickness, t, as the end wall 16, the first coined zone 154 is 0.6t, the recess 184 has a thickness of 0.5t and the outermost coined ring under hold down tool 172 has a thickness of 0.6t. The formed end wall shape shown in Figure 27 can be formed into the rivet 36 shown in Figure 6. It is preferred, however, to reform the shape into a substantially uniform dome 192, as shown in Figure 28, prior to forming the rivet. The dome is formed by restraining the end wall 16 against movement with hold down tooling 193 while a mandrel 194 is forced upwardly against the interior surface of the shape shown in Figure 27 reforming the shape to the dome configuration of the cavity in female die 195. Rivet 36 is formed by a step referred to as staking. An assembly of the rivet dome 192 and cap is made by inserting the dome through the opening in the cap arms 34, and the assembly is positioned in the staking tooling as shown in Figure 29. The lower die 196 has a planar support surface 198 to support the can end wall 16 and a cylindrical portion 200 with an upper planar surface 202 thereon extending upwardly therefrom. An upper tool assembly comprising a central cylindrical die 204 having a planar end surface 206 and a hollow cylindrical die 208 having a downwardly and outwardly sloping end surface 210 therearound is positioned coaxially with the lower cylinder portion 200. The cylindrical die 204 and hollow cylindrical die 208 are adapted for independent axial movement. Upper die 204 is first moved downwardly whereby the dome portion between dies 204 and 196 is first flattened and then thinned. Metal displaced by the thinning extrudes radially outwardly forming the rivet flange 45, as shown in Figure 30. Die 208 is then moved axially downward a controlled distance, as shown in Figure 31, whereby rivet flange 45 is bent downwardly to engage the sloping recess surface 41 of the cap arms 34 and press the ledge 39 against the coined recess seat 184. The downward movement of die 208 is controlled to insure that the cap arms 34 are not engaged with the rivet 36 so tightly that rotation of the cap about the rivet is restricted. Upper dies 204 and 208 can be combined into a single die, but it is preferred that they be separate to better control the downward bending of the rivet flange. In an alternate embodiment of this invention shown in Figure 32, the can end severable opening panel may be located in a recessed portion of the can end panel. Such a can end closure 12 differs from that shown in Figures 1 and 2 only with respect to the spout 20 structure. Can end 12 has a spout 20 depend ing from end wall 16 . A radiused lip 30 formed from coined metal projects into the spout at the juncture of the spout and the end wall. The spout has an inwardly concave opening panel 27 connected to the spout side wall 22 by a line of weakness 26 except at an un weakened hinge portion 28 . A cap of this invention for use with the can end shown in Figure 31 differs from the cap 10 shown in Figures 4 and 5 only with respect to seal portion 32. A seal portion 32 suit able for use with the can end shown in Figure 32 is shown in Figure 33. The seal portion 32 has a top wall 40 with a skirt 42 depending therefrom. An annular lip 212 projects outwardly from the skirt 42 in line with top wall 40 . An annular groove 50 is defined by a arcuate portion 214 in the top wall with a central disc portion 46 inwardly of the groove. A downwardly and outwardly sloping ledge 44 spaced away from the lip 212 projects outwardly from the skirt 42 An annular ring 216 having a triangular cross section is connected to the skirt 42 and top wall 40 at the junction thereof. A lifting tab 38 projects upwardly from the top wall 40 along an edge portion thereof. The seal portion 32 is connected to arms identical to arms 34 shown in Figures 4, 6 and 24. Referring now to Figure 34, the seal portion 32 is shown in combination with spout 20 after open ing panel 27 has been partially separated from the spout and bent inwardly at hinge 28 . Such an open ing is effected by positioning the seal portion 32 in coaxial alignment with spout 20 and pressing down wardly. Skirt 42 flexes inwardly as sloping surface 66 contacts lip 30 , and after clearing the lip, the skirt flexes outwardly to be aligned adjacent the score line 26 above the opening panel 27 . Continued downward pressure causes fracture of the score line and bends the opening panel 27 inwardly at the hinge 28 To gain access to the can contents, the tab 38 may be lifted to remove seal portion 32 . To reseal the opening, the seal portion 32 is again aligned with the spout 20 and pushed downward ly until ledge 44 clears spout lip 30 . An initial low pressure seal is established by compression of skirt wall 42 against the smooth radiused lip 30 . As internal pressure increases, the seal portion 32 is lifted until ledge 44 contacts the underside of lip 30 and thereafter a sealing engagement is maintained between the ledge and lip, as shown in Figure 35. It is noted that annular groove 50 is provided only to give a clear indication that the can is sealed by inversion of the groove from the action of internal pressure. If desired, the groove can be eliminated without detrimentally affecting the sealing characteristics. As previously discussed, the downward angle of inclination from horizontal of ledge 44 is important. Since the internal pressure acting on a cap of this alternate embodiment will tend to rotate the skirt 42 so as to increase such angle, stiffener ring 216 is provided at the junction of skirt 42 and top wall 40 to prevent such rotation. It is noted that it is not essential that the opener reseal device be rotatably attached to the can end panel to be within the scope of this invention. For example, the device may be tightly secured by alternate means, such as a rivet or a suitable adhesive, for example, with the cap portion 32 overlying the open ing panel in an unengaged position. After opening the can in a manner as previously described with respect to the preferred embodiment, the cap portion may be manipulated away from the opening by flexing the arm so as to gain access to the can contents. Furthermore, the device may be rigidly attached to the can end with the opener reseal portion stored alongside the spout, as shown in Figure 1. By providing an arm or arms 34 of sufficient flexibility, the opener reseal portion 32 can be manipulated to overlay the spout to effect opening or resealing. From the foregoing, it may be seen that numerous modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
