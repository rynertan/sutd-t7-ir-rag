# Picture signal processing system suitable for displaying continuous tone pictures.

## Abstract
A local fluctuation factor in the density of an input picture is detected by a detector circuit 10, 13 on the basis of a pic ture information signal to be supplied to a picture output de vice 22 so as to display an output picture which correspond to the input picture. To display a continuous tone picture pleasantly a picture information processing circuit 14 and 18 to 21 is provided for binarization and dithering of a picture in formation signal. The processing circuit is responsive to the detector circuit to supply binary picture information to the pic ture output device when the local fluctuation factor is larger than a predetermined value and dithered picture information to the picture output device when the local fluctuation factor is smaller than the predetermined value.
