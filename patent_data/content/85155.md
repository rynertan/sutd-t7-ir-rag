# Nitrogen generation system.

## Abstract
A PSA pressure swing adsorber system for producing high purity nitrogen from compressed air containing a pressure swing dryer to dry the compressed air arranged for regeneration by oxygen enriched desorption effluent gasses from the PSA towers. A product nitrogen purge assists in desorption of the PSA towers and leads to improved yield. The system is characterized by capability for yields of 99.5 nitrogen plus argon to exceed about 25 and an efficiency of about 60 volumes of the 99.5 product per volume of adsorbent per hour.
