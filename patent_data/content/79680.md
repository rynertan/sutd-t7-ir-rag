# Circuitry controlled by coded manual switching for producing a control signal.

## Abstract
Circuitry controlled by a series of switch actuations per a preselected switch code provides a control signal. A plurality of flip flop circuits 13 16 are connected for series operation. A plurality of switches 1 12 in excess of the number of digits in the code are available to provide an actuating signal for a flip flop circuit. A time delay 83 85 provided between successive flip flop circuits enables a given switch to be used more than once for a switch code. Automatic resetting of the last flip flop circuit 16 at which the control signal is provided allows tne control signal to be repeated one or more times before all of the flip flop circuits 13 16 are reset. A time delay circuit 35 at the first flip flop circuit 13 provides for automatic reset of the circuitry. Each switch not connected to a flip flop circuit as a digit of the switch code will, when actuated, reset the circuitry. The control signal that is provided is useful for operation of a door lock or to operate an automatic garage door opener.
