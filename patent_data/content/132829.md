# VIDEO RANGEFINDER

## Abstract
A system for determining range and orientation of distant objects, such as a ship, is claimed. By utilizing split imaging the observed height on a video monitor can be accurately determined despite movements of the image on the monitor. The observed ship can be visually identified and the true height determined from reference source. A better compari son of data indicating the true height compared to observed height permits calculation of the range to the target ship. Split imaging can also be utilized to determine the observed length of the ship so that observed height and length data can be compared to the true height and length of the target ship to determine orientation of the target ship relative to the observed.
