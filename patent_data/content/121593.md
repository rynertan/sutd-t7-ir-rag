# OPTICAL SYSTEM FOR IMAGING AN ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC MEMBER

## Abstract
An optical system for imaging an electrophotographic member, which is carried on a drum 66 , supplies a beam 60 of radiant energy, splits it into a fine beam 62 and a reference beam 118 and vertically aligns the fine and reference beams, respectively, above and below one anoth er. The fine beam is composed of individual rays split from the supplied beam in response to electrical signals. Mirrors 122, 128, 134 and focusing lenses 124, 126, 132 direct the fine and reference beams through a field flattening lens 136 to a raster mirror 138 , which reflects the beams back through the field flattening lens to the electrophotographic member. The raster mirror 138 oscillates back and forth about an axis and sweeps the fine and reference beams back and forth across an arc 142 with the fine beam de scribing an image line on the member. The vertical posi tions of the fine and reference beams are inverted by the raster mirror.
