An opening 4 is provided in the upstream disc of each zone and a transfer blade 6 is associated with each opening to urge material therethrough as the conveyor is rotated. In one embodiment, the upstream disc of the second zone is provided with an additional opening 4 such that a dose of material ejected from the first zone will be spread across the second and third zones for treatment therein and will be subsequently recombined in the fourth zone.
