# Improvements in or relating to paving blocks.

## Abstract
A paving block, particularly for use in constructing revet ments, is configured so that a three dimensional interlock is obtained between adjacent blocks. At least one face 1,21 of the block has an edge contour comprising alternate recesses 2, 3 etc. and projections 4, 5 etc. . The side walls of the block comprise inclined faces 8b, 8d etc. which, in one form of the block join the edges of the recesses and projections to the edges of the opposite face 18 of the block, which is rectangular. In another form of the block, the inclined faces 27a, 27b etc. join the edges of the recess and projections to a rectangular contour 31 located midway between the two faces 21, 22 of the block. These blocks may be roped together to form a mat by cables 40 running between adjacent mats along the edges of the rectangular contours 31 .

## Description
ImDrovemeats in or relating to Paving Blocks This invention relates to paving blocks such as are used to pave areas of ground and has particular reference to blocks for use in the construction of revetments for the protection of river banks, sea walls and the like from erosion. Paving blocks are usually configured so that they can be interlocked during laying to impart stability in two dimensions over the paved surface to resist lateral forces. However, the interlocking is required to be such that some degree of relative vertical movement between adjacent blocks is required to avoid cracking which might otherwise occur. Blocks for use in the construction of revetments should also be able to withstand vertical pressures and thus a three dimensional interlock between adjacent blocks is desirable. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a paving block contoured to enable it to interlock effectively in three dimensions and which is also of relatively simple design. It is a further object to provide a mat of paving blocks which can be prefabricated in a relatively simple manner for use in, for example, the construction of revetments. According to the present invention, a paving block has a first face of generally rectangular form with an edge contour comprising alternate straightedged recesses and projections the block also having, in a plane parallel to the first face, a rectangular contour located centrally with respect to the first face the side walls of the block comprising a series of inclined faces joining the edges of the recesses and projections to the edges of the rectangular contour. The rectangular contour may be the edge contour of a second face of the block. Alternatively, the rectangular contour may be located in a plane intermediate the first face and a second face of the block. In this case, the edge contours of the first and second faces are preferably the same. The alternative form of block may be used to form a paving mat in which the blocks are roped together by at least one cable which extends along an edge of the rectangular contour of a block. The invention further provides a paving mat compri sing a plurality of blocks roped together by at least one cable which extends along one side of at least a pair of adjacent blocks. By way of example only, blocks embodying the invention and suitable for use in the construction of revetments will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figs0 1 and 2 are plan views of a first block Fig 3 is a section on the line III III of Pig. 1 Fig. 4 is a perspective view of several of the blocks laid in interlocking engagement Fig. 5 is a perspective view of C second block Fig. 6 is a section, corresponding to that of Fig. 3, through the block of Fig. 5 Fig. 7 illustrates a modification of Fig. 6, and Figs. 8 to 1O illustrate arrays of blocks in accerdance with the invention. The block shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 has a first, flat face 1 √èf generally rectangular form but wh e edge contour is of the form described in U.K. Patent Specification No. 1,520,274. to face 1 has one edge with outwardly flared recesses 2, 3 separated by an inwardly flared projection 4. The recess is bounded by a further inwardly flared projection 5. The opposite edge has an inwardly flared projection 6 that lies opposite recess 2 and that is bounded by outwardly flared recesses 7, 8 that lie opposite projections 4 and 5 respectively. On the other side of recess 7 from projections 6 is a further inwardlyflared projection 9. The face 1 also has an end edge with an inwardlyflared projection 10 adjacent an outwardly flared recess 11. The other end edge of the face 1 has an outwardlyflared recess 12 that lies opposite projection 10 and an inwardly flared projection 13 that lies opposite to recess 11. As can be seen from Fig. 1, recesses 3, 8, 11 and 12 are each bounded on one side by projections 14, 15, 16 and 17 respectively, such projections being, in effect, continuations of projections 13, 10, 5 and 9 respectively.Projections 14.....17 are rounded as shown. The opposite face 18 of the block is of rectangular form whose corners lies centrally beneath the rounded projections 14.....17. Between the faces 1, 18 of the block, the side walls are contoured to provide inwardly inclined faces linking the flat outer ends of the projections 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 13 with the edges of the rectangular face 18 and outwardly inclined faces linking the flat inner ends of the recesses 2, 3, 7, 8, 11 and 12 with those edges. The perspective view of Fig. 4 shows the inclined faces and it will be observed that each increases in width from the edges of face 1 to the edges of face 18. This is because the edges of the face 18 lie midway between the flat outer and inner ends of the projections and recesses of the edge of the front face 1. Thus, the flared sides of the projections and recesses of the edges of the front face give rise to triangular shaped surfaces between those edges. Referring to Fig. 4, the inner end 8a of recess is joined by an inclined face 8b to the edge of the face 18. The outer end 6a of the adjacent projection 6 is joined by an inclined face 6b to the edge of the face 18. Faces 6b and 8b are trapezoidal and increase in width from edges 6a and 8b respectively to the edge of face 18. The flared sides 8c of recess 8 are joined by inclined faces 8d of inverted triangular shape to the edge of the face 18. Similarly, the flared sides 6c, 8c of projection 6 are joined by inclined faces 6d of inverted triangular shape to the edge of face 18. As has been stated above, the corners of face 18 lie centrally beneath the rounded projections 14..117 and the sides of the rectangular face, when the block is viewed as in Fig. 1, lie along lines that bisect the flared sides of the recesses and projections of the edge contour of the face 1. Thus, faces 8b and 6b are oppositely inclined. In like manner, the inner ends, flared sides and outer ends of the remaining recesses and projections of the edge contour of the face 1 are joined to edges of face 18 by inclined faces. Thus, when laid on a flat surface, adjacent blocks are interlocked by the interengaging projections and recesses to give two dimensional stability to resist lateral faces and by the interengaging inclined faces between faces 1 and 18 to give stability in the third dimension so that the blocks will resist both upward and downward forces. In practice, there will be nominal gaps between the interengaging projections, recesses and inclined faces of adjacent blocks but this will not prevent interlocking of the blocks to resist the forces described. Figs. 1 and 3 indicate that conduits 50 may be formed in the blocks. The purpose of these conduits is described below. The block shown in Fig. 6 is similar to that shown in Figs. 1 to 3 but, instead of having one face of rectangular form, both faces 21,22 are of generally rectangular form with an edge contour of the form described in U.K. Patent Specification No. 1,520,274. The edge contours of the two faces 21 ,22 coincide when the block is viewed from above, that is the flared recesses and projections such as 23,24,25,26 of the lower face 22 are located directly below corresponding flared recesses and projections 27,28,29,30 respectively of the upper face 21. In a plane midway between the two faces 21, 22 and parallel thereto, the block has a rectangular contour 31. The corners of the rectangle lie centrally beneath the end projections 32 to 35 of the face 21, in the manner described for the rectangular face 18 of Figs. 1 to 3, and centrally above the corresponding end projections of which only 36 to 38 can be seen inFig. 5 of the face 22. The edges of the recesses and projections such as 23 to 30 of both faces 21, 22 of the block are all joined by inclined faces to the rectangular contour 31 exactly in the manner already described for the block of Figs. 1 to 3. In tbe case of projection 24 of the face 22, for example, these inclined faces are indicated at 24a, 24b and 24c and in the case of recess 27 of the face 21 they are indicated at 27a, 27b and 27c. It will be seen that, from above, this second block has the same plan view as the first block, shown in Fig. t. Blocks of the type shown in Fig. 5 will also interlock effectively in three dimensions when laid on a flat surface and both forms of block can be used in the construction of revetments on river banks and sea shores for example. The blocks may be aid individually in which case a sloping base is prepared with, if necessary, a toe beam of concrete supported by piles. The blocks are then laid upon the prepared surface in interlocked configuration, the Interlocking surfaces of adjacent blocks being in contact. The blocks may be laid in any suitable configuration although a herringbone pattern as illustrated in Fig. 8 is particularly stable. Alternatively, in the construction of a revetment it may be preferable to incorporate cables between the blocks as they are being laid or, indeed, to lay the blocks in the form of mats, each mat comprising a number of blocks roped together by a non corrosive cable system.In the latter case, the pre assembled mats are laid on the prepared sloping base, using a crane, and secured to anchor points at the top of the revetment. The block shown in Fig. 5 is particularly suitable for use with cable in either of these ways because the nominal gap between adjacent blocks always runs in a straight line at the mid plane of the blocks providing, effectively, a channel through which a cable system can pass. This is illustrated in Fig. 6 which shows a section through a block with 2 cable 40 running lengthwise on either side adjacent the rectangular contour 31.If desired, the block could be modified as illustrated in Fig. 7 by the provision of a groove 41 on either side specifically to accommodate the cables and, a cable could, similarly, run widthwise of the block either in addition to, or as an alternative to the cable 40. One suitable configuration of the blocks when used with a cable system is illustrated in Fig. 9. In this case, the blocks are laid in alternating pairs and a system of cables 42,43 runs both lengthwise and widthwise between the pairs. As can be seen, the set of parallel cables 42 extending in one direction is anchored, at points 44, on each side of the array of blocks while the cables 43 extending in the other direction are anchored, at points 45, at one end only with the other ends 46 of the cables being free. The mat of cables which is formed in this way can be prefabricated, laid in place by a crane and subsequently secured by attaching the free cable ends 46 to anchor points. Alternatively, if desired, a cable system such as that 42,43 illustrated in Fig. 9 can be incorporated when blocks are laid in place by hand. However, blocks need not be roped together in the manner illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7 but could, for example, be formed with one or more conduits therethrough, through which the cable system is passed. Such conduits are indicated at 50 in Figs. 1 and 3, for example, and could similarly be included in the block of Figs.5 and 6 but would, of course, be omitted if not required. Fig.10 illustrates, by way of example, an array of blocks roped together by cables 51 which pass through the blocks and a mat of blocks prefabricated in this manner could be laid in place by crane as already described. A preassembled mat may be of any appropriate size, depending on the location in which it is to be laid and the equipment available for handling it. The use of preassembled mats is particularly advantageous when a revetment is being constracted under water or when it is not possible to provide an adequate toe beam support for the blocks to be laid individually. The blocks described above can also be used to pave horizontal surfaces where the three dimensional stability referred to above is required. The blocks are made from concrete, a suitable mix being. 1 part cement 1 parts aggregate 3 parts sand and are formed in moulds using standard production techniques. The top surface of the blocks may have a smooth flat finish or a profiled finish or, if required, a rough finish provided, for example, by incorporating unbroken stones. The overall block dimensions and the degree of inclination of the inclined faces will depend upon the use to which the blocks are to be put. It is also possible to vary the shape of the alternate projections and recesses in the edge contour of the faces 1, 21 and 22 of the blocks and also the number of those projections and recesses without destroying the threedimensional interlock between adjacent blocks. Moreover, in the block of Fig. 5 it is not essential for the lower half of the block to be a mirror image of the upper half to enable the desired three dimensional interlock to be obtained, nor for the rectanguZar contour 31 to be midway between the faces 21,22 of the block, although the symmetry simplifies both the design and use of the block.
