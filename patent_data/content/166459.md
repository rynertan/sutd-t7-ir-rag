# A method and apparatus for collecting articles successively fed on a conveyor into at least two groups separated by a gap.

## Abstract
Rectangular articles, such as milk or juice boxes, successi vely fed along a conveyor A are arranged into groups of articles by pushing a contiguous row of articles transversely from the conveyor in front of the receiving surface of a stepwise tapered pusher B whose contiguous sequence of steps is interrupted by at least one omitted or receded portion b0 . By reciprocating the pusher B in a direction parallel to the conveyor A the articles accumulated in front of the pusher are successively pushed onto a receiving platform D to form groups of articles, with exception of those articles which are located in front of the omitted portion b0 of the pusher B , wich are intercepted by a stopper 3 , thereby providing for the gap to be formed between the groups of articles.
