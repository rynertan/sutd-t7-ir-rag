# Mechanism for feeding web in a typing mechanism.

## Abstract
In a mechanism for friction feeding web, such as paper, in a typing machine having pairs of pressure rollers being journal supporting and engageable and disengageable with a cylindrical platen of the typing machine to achieve a less complex design and to reduce manufacturing costs, the in vention provides that each of the pairs of rollers are part of a truck assembly unit 30, 32 having two identical parts 34, 36 which lock together capturing two pressure rollers 38, 40 . The truck assembly unit 30, 32 is supported on a cylin drical portion of a support bar 12 so that it can rotate through a limited range, the range being limited by a ridge running along the bar. The support 20 is affixed eccentrically on journals 18, 20 captured in the frame 22, 24 of a typing a machine so that rotation of the bar moves the supported truck assembly towards and away from the platen 80 . Arms sup porting the rollers 46, 48 provide flexure to bias the rollers 38, 40 against the platen 80 .
