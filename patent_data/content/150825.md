# IMPROVED CIRCUIT CONNECTION FOR COILS WOUND ON YOKE OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC PICKUP CARTRIDGE

## Abstract
An electromagnetic pickup cartridge having a pair of out put terminals and a yoke with a pair of arms and a pair of gen erator coils respectively wound on the arms where the first of the coils has a start terminal where the coil winding begins and an end terminal where the winding ends and the second of the coils also has a start terminal and an end terminal to thus pro vide a first pair of start terminals and a pair of end terminals where one of the pairs of terminals are connected to each other and the other of the pairs of terminals are respectively con nected to the output terminals. In particular, the start terminals may be connected to each other while the end terminals are re spectively connected to the output terminals or vice versa.
