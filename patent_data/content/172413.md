## Description
This invention relates to a process for producing a piperidine derivative. More particularly, this invention relates to a process for producing a piperidine derivative represented by the general formula III wherein R₁ is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms R₂ is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and R₃ and R₄ is each independently an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms. The piperidine derivative represented by the above mentioned general formula III is known to be useful as a light stabilizer for high molecular substances such as plastics, rubbers and fibers. There has already been known as a process for producing the piperidine derivative represented by the general formula III a process which comprises reacting 4 amino 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine in the general formula I which will be shown later, R₁ and R₂ are each H with α bromo α,α dimethyl N 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinylacetamide EP A 0 062 322 . However, the above known process requires an extremely special raw material, such as α bromo α,α dimethyl N 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinylacetamide, and further gives a low yield of intended product as low as 69 , so that it can hardly be deemed as an industrially satisfactory process for production. Under these circumstances, the present inventors have made intensive studies to find an industrially advantageous process for producing the piperidine derivative represented by the general formula III . As a result, it has been found that the intended product can be obtained selectively and without requiring the special raw material, α bromo α,α dialkyl N 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinylacetamide, by reacting a piperidine represented by the general formula I shown later and a ketone in the presence of chloroform and alkali and thus the present invention has been accomplished.
