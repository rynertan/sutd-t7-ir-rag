# Process for the preparation of pure silicon dioxide.

## Abstract
Pure silicon dioxide is prepared by admixing in a first step a H₂SiF₆ solution with a quantitiy of NH₄OH solution, which is 40 75 wt of the amount required for conversion to NH₄F and SiO₂ separating out the precipitate formed, treating the remaining liquid with NH₄OH, and recovering the pure SiO₂ precipitate formed. The SiO₂ obtained is useful as a catalyst support or as a substitute for quartz.
