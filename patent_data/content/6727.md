# Optical scanner.

## Abstract
An optical scanner is incorporated in a thermal imaging system which generates high resolution images at commercial T.V. rates while scanning relatively large apertures. A facet mirror 25 is mounted for rotation about a vertical rotational axis 33 , and a framing mirror 43 is mounted on the optical axis 51 for oscillation about a horizontal oscillatory axis 59 . An off axis, magnifying relay lens system 41 including an objective lens 45 and an eyepiece 47 re images the pupil at the facet mirror onto the framing mirror, so that there is a real pupil at the framing mirror with no image artifacts. The relay lens system 41 is located in the optical path between the facet mirror 25 and the framing mirror 43 and provides a magnification of about 1.8. The relay lens system defines an image plane 53 and at least one point blockbody is located substantially at the image plane for purposes of providing a video reference and calibration. A detector 21 receives the focused beam of radia tion reflected by the facet mirror through a collimator 23 for subsequent display on commercial T.V. monitors 19 . The detector shares vacuum with the high speed scanner.
