# USE OF LEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTS FOR PRODUCING CYTOPROTECTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING CYTOPROTECTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Leukotriene antagonists have been found to be useful for inducing cytoprotection via an unspecified mechanism. Specific therapeutic utilities include, erosive gastritis, erosive esophagitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and induced hemorrhagic gastric erosions such as those caused by indomethacin or ethanol. The leukotriene antagonists are used to produce cyto protective pharmaceutical compositions. In a process for pro ducing cytoprotective pharmaceutical compositions the leukotriene antagonists are incorporated into a correspond ing composition in a cytoprotective effective amount.
