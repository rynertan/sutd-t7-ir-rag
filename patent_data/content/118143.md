## Abstract
A method and a device for manufacturing an informa tion carrier of synthetic material having a laminated struc ture, in which a transparent carrier 2 is provided away from the mould with a resin layer 10 12 and is then brought to a position opposite a mould with its resin layer facing the mould, after which the carrier is pressed against the mould 21 progressively from a boundary surface of the carrier by means of one or more rollers 24 and at least the part of the carrier located directly behind the roller or rollers is exposed 22 for curing the resin layer, the carrier with the cured resin layer being subsequently removed from the mould and further transported.
