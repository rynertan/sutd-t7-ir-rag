# Bidirectional seal.

## Abstract
An improved bidirectional sealing element for sealing between two parallel cylindrical surfaces including an in wardly facing outer surface and an outwardly facing inner surface which includes a resilient sealing ring having a central mass, side masses on each side of the central mass, a pair of sealing lips extending radially outwardly and axi ally away from the central mass to engage and seal against said outer surface and a pair of sealing lips extending radially inwardly and axially away from the central mass to engage and seal against said inner surface, the side mas ses having a smaller internal diameter than the internal diameter of the central mass so that the side masses engage said inner cylindrical surface on contraction respon sive to cooling prior to the engagement of the inner surface of the central mass so that the central mass continues to contract and causes said outer sealing lips to move radially outwardly to maintain their sealing engagement with said outer cylindrical surface.
