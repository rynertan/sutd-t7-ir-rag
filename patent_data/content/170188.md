# Novel phenothiazines, preparation thereof and use thereof in electrochromic recording systems.

## Abstract
3 N R² N Acylamino 7 N R³ N R⁴ ami no 10 acylphenothiazines and phenoxazines useful as color formers, particularly in electrochromic recording sys tems, are prepared by the interaction of the corresponding 3 N R² amino 7 N R³ N R⁴ amino phenothiazi nium or phenoxazinium halide with a reducing agent to obtain the corresponding leuco compound and subsequently interacting the leuco compound with at least two molecular proportions of an acylating agent.
