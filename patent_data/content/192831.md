# SURFACE MODIFICATION OF HYDROPHILIC CONTACT LENSES

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method of modifying a surface of a soft contact lens to make the lens resistant to soiling. The method comprises initiating a reaction between the unhydrated lens surface containing carboxylic acid or alcohol moieties and agents capable of reacting with car boxylic acid or alcohol moieties in order to produce a surface which then either has a hydrophobic coating, a nonionic hydrophilic coating or is charged.
