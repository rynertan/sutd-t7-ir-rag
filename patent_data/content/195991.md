# Process for producing degummed vegetable oils and gums of high phosphatidic acid content.

## Abstract
A process for producing at the same time degummed vegetable oils and gums of high phosphatidic acid content is described. The starting materials for this process are veg etable oils which have been conventionally water degummed and accordingly still contain too much non hydratable phos phatides and iron for further processing by physical refining and providing a refined oil of good keepability. Therefore in a first stage of the disclosed process a non toxic aqueous acid, e.g. phosphoric acid, is finely dispersed in the water de gummed oil and sufficient contact time is allowed to complete the decomposition of the metal salts of phosphatidic acid. In a second stage a base is added to increase the pH above 2.5 without substantial formation of soap and in a third stage the aqueous phase containing the gums and the oil phase are sep arated. Surprisingly this process not only results in a de gummed oil with very low phosphorus and iron contents which make the oil suitable for physical refining but also provides gums of high phosphatidic acid content with improved usabil ity.
