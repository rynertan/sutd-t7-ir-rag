# Dental floss dispenser.

## Abstract
A dental floss dispenser preferably in a credit card format permitting the dispenser to be conveniently carried on a person. The dispenser comprises a base panel 10 having a peripheral ridge 12 to define a shallow well 13 within which is nested a supply of dental floss in flattened coil form 14 . The leading end of the coil 14 passes out of the well 13 through an aperture 15 and is caught by a lug adjacent an edge notch 17 cut in the base panel 10 . Anchored in the well 13 is a blade 18 whose cutting edge is exposed by the notch 17 , whereby when floss is pulled out of the well 13 to provide a usable length, the trailing end thereof may be cut by the blade 18 . The dispenser is completed by a face panel 11 bonded to the ridge 12 to encapsulate the floss supply, the face panel 11 having a corresponding notch 13 .
