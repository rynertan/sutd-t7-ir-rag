# GAIN AMPLIFIER

## Abstract
A novel switched capacitor gain stage uses a unique cir cuit design and clocking technique that reduces the compo nent mismatch offset voltage and the clock induced feed through offset voltage produced by the circuit. The total capac itance ratio between the input capacitors and the feedback capacitor necessary to achieve a desired total gain is also mini mized.
