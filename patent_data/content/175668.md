# Composite fluid separation membranes.

## Abstract
A membrane having improved fluide permeabilities and a method for preparing same are disclosed. The membrane is comprised of a porous support in the form of a flat sheet, tube or hollow fiber which is impregnated with a volatile sol vent followed by the in situ formation of a separating layer wherein the preimpregnation of the pores of the porous sup port with the solvent provide a separating layer of substan tially uniform thickness and minimum intrusion of the sepa rating layer polymer into the pores of the porous support.
