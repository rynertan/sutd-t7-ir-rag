## Description
The invention relates to an abrasive wheel mounting apparatus accrding to the preamble of claim 1. Abrasive wheels consist of integral stones or of stone sections. The term stone is intended to include also all kinds of abrasive artificial stone, i.e. molded, bonded or vitrified abrasive members. Modern disc or attrition mills use steel discs that can be rotated at higher speeds than the early buhrstone mills. For many applications like size reduction of organic materials such as rubber, plastics or wood pulp, stones are superior to metal discs, if operated at high speeds. However, there is the disadvantage of stones breaking at high speeds due to centrifugal and thermal stresses. In the past, grinding wheels have been held in place onto the supporting member by using cement such as molten sulphur, lead or other suitable material and or clamping means including steel wedges Fig. 5 in US A 3,117,603 . It is also known to use clamping bars or wedges arranged at the inner periphery of sectors to force same against outer lips or flanges of a backing plate so that an essentially outwardly directed radial compressive load is produced to hold the sectors in place Fig. 4 of US A 3,117,603 . In a known apparatus of the kind referred to above DE A 1,607,612, Fig. 3 , an elastic supporting ring having a bevelled inner surface is pressed by springs against the outer bevelled surface of the abrasive disc or wheel, the arrangement being such as to allow some movement between the components for compensating any difference in the thermal expansion thereof. This means that the taper is a self releasing one. Furthermore, springs can hardly produce forces as requested under the last feature of claim 1. Also the springs and bolts for holding the ring extend above the grinding level of the disc so that cooperation with the second disc of the mill is hardly possible and will require a special construction of the mill in any case. Fig. 1 and 2 of DE A 1,607,612 show an arrangement of levers and flight weights to bear against the outer cylindrical surface of the abrasive wheel when the rotational speed increases. A prestress as with the last feature of claim 1 is not intended. In a further known apparatus for mounting an abrasive wheel DE A 1,507,527 the grinding disc or wheel is intended to be clamped at its inner and outer peripheral rim. To this end, the outer periphery of the grinding disc has a bevelled surfce under 45 to the disc plane and is engaged by a clamping ring which has a corresponding bevelled surface to press the disc onto the supporting member which has an inner shoulder and create also some radial inwardly directed stress. DE A 1,507,527 is saying that the stresses should be so high that, at all operational conditions, engagement on both inner and outer clamping surfaces is guaranteed. Whereas usual abrasive wheels cannot be pressed together from the outside so as to engage the inner shoulder of the supporting member, the taper of the bevelled surface under 45 in any case will produce an axial directed compressive load of essential value on the outer rim of the wheel. This will lead to shearing forces, that is, a prestress on the wheel in an even manner in radial direction throughout its periphery is not possible. The problem to be solved by invention is to create an apparatus for mounting an abrasive wheel onto a rotable supporting member which can be used in disc or attrition mills for operating same at high speeds with abrasive wheels consisting of an integral stone or of stone segments. The solution to this problem can be found in claim 1 or 4. With a rotational speed of 3600 rpm the diameter of 0.305 m gives a peripheral speed of 57.46 m s ¹ and also for the usual rotatinal speed in Europe near 3000 rpm, the peripheral speed of 17.88 m s ¹ exceeds the U.S. maximum standard speed of 32.5 m s ¹ 6500 feet minute . The radial compressive force onto the wheel provided with invention makes it possible to use wheel diameters and rotational speeds for abrasive wheels which formerly could be used only for metal mill discs. One possibility for providing the required compressive load or force comprises using a taper similar to those commonly used in the machine tool industry. A suitable taper can be one of two types depending on the application. A self holding taper is defined as a taper with an angle small enough to hold in place ordinarily by friction without holding means. Sometimes referred to as a slow taper. A steep taper is defined as a taper having an angle sufficiently large to ensure the easy or self releasing feature. As disclosed above, the use of tapers is a well known industry practice. Their use and description is disclosed in Machinery s Handbook, 19th edition, pages 1678 1692. The taper may be an integral part in which case the separate part mates the straight wheel outer diameter and carries the appropriate taper on the outside diameter. The machine tool industry uses these tool elements on certain types of small tools and machine parts, such as twist drills, arbors, lathe centers, etc., to fit into spindles or sockets of corresponding taper, thus providing not only accurate alignment between the tool or other part and its supporting member, but also more or less frictional resistance for driving the tool. Both elements of the taper are usually small and made of metal in the case of the machine tool industry without regard for placing the male member in compression other than for frictional resistance. For grinding wheels, which can resist high compression loads but very low tension loads, this compression feature of the taper makes it possible to pre stress the wheel using the outer female element of the taper made of metal which has a high modulus in comparison with the wheel itself. The compression load placed on the wheel by the taper is balanced against any tension stresses in use by the female element and the wheel need not be an integral element but may be made of two or more sections. Accordingly, in the apparatus of the invention, the means to place a compressive load on the wheel is a taper element, the taper being a slow or non releasing one. In the method of the invention, the compression loading may be obtained by means of taper elements incorporating the wheel itself, or by taper element other than the wheel, in both cases the taper being a slow or non releasing one. Instead, the compression loading may be by hydraulic or pneumatic clamping. According to another aspect of the invention, a method of comminuting vulcanized rubber comprising grinding it between two grinding stones is characterized in that said stones have a diameter of at least 305 mm 12 inch , are placed under a radial compressive load at mounting, and are rotated at a rate of at least 3.600 rpm. Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of a wheel mounted with a taper on the wheel. Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a wheel mounted with the taper elements separate from the wheel. Figure 3 is a diagrammatic view of the forces and supporting reactions on the taper. Figure 4 is a force polygon used to solve for the supporting reactions and forces on the taper. Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of a wheel mounted with fluid clamping to induce compressive stress. Figure 1 is an illustration of a tapered grinding wheel. A conventional grinding stone 1 is tapered on its outer periphery 2 according to the present invention. The stone is placed on a drive table 3 which rotates about shaft 4. The stone 1 is mounted on table 3 by means of a holding ring 6 which has been cut with a tapered surface 12 to accommodate the taper on wheel 2. Ring 6 is mounted on drive table 3 by means of a threaded screw 7 which passes through an opening 8 in ring 6 and is threaded into a corresponding opening 9 in drive table 3. A suitable number of mounting screws 7 may be placed around ring 6 to tightly secure wheel 1 to table 3. In operation, wheel 1 has a counterpart bearing a similar taper above the one shown separated by a suitable distance to allow the grinding action to take place. The upper stone is similarly affixed to a non rotating mount so that the grinding action takes place between the lower rotating wheel and the upper fixed wheel. An alternative embodiment is illustrated in Figure 2, wherein a conventional wheel 1 does not have a taper but is in the normal cylindrical configuration. As in Figure 1, the stone in Figure 2 is mounted on a drive table 3 by means of holding ring 6 through which are threaded a series of screws 7 attaching the holding ring to the drive table. However, in Figure 2, there is an additional split ring 11 which provides the taper for engaging the holding ring 6. Ring 11 is a ring of brass, stainless steel or suitable material which encircles stone 1. The inside circumference of ring 11 is slightly smaller than the outside circumference of wheel 1. There is a split in the circumference of ring 11 to allow a gap of approximately 3 mm 1 8 inch to facilitate the encirclement of ring 11 around stone 1. When the stone 1 and ring 11 are placed on table 3, holding ring 6 may be tightened down to narrow the gap in the split of ring 11 and securely hold stone 1 against table 3. In a preferred embodiment, the split ring 11 is a tapered steel ring straight cut on the inside diameter and matching the outside diameter of the stone. The ring 11 is tapered 292 mm m three and one half inches per foot on the outside diameter. The thickness of the ring 11 varies with the thickness of the stone 1 and in all areas the taper is from the top edges. The ring 11 is cut in half across the diameter and 6,3 mm one quarter inch cut from each end. In association with the two split rings 11, is a third ring 6 with the inside cut to the same taper as the split rings 11. The ring is provided with recessed mounting bolts 7 and, when mounted over the split rings 11 and bolted to the stationary or rotary mounting plate 3, compresses the split rings 11 against the grinding disc 1 and puts the stone under compression. This allows the stones 1 to be driven from the outside. Thus, the compression load placed on the wheels 1 by the taper is balanced against tension stresses generated by centrifugal force of the rotating wheels. The purpose of holding ring 6 in both the embodiment of Figure 1 and Figure 2 is to prestress the stone in an even manner so that tension forces are evenly applied throughout the periphery of the stone. The prestress applied by holding ring 6 to stone 1 gives the stone the capability of counteracting the centrifugal forces in operation. Figure 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of the forces and reactions on the taper of the wheel of Figure 1 or the ring 11 of Figure 2. The figure shows the forces which act upon the taper in accordance with the following formula The required force P to move the taper in the direction of P and overcome force H may be determined by using the force polygon shown in Figure 4. The friction angles of the three faces of the triangle are a₁, a₂, and a₃. The supporting reactions K₁, K₂, and K₃ may also be determined from the force polygon of Figure 4. In order for the taper to be a slow or non releasing one, the value of b should be greater than the value of the sum of a₁ and a₃. Stated in another way, the value of b should be more than twice the value of a. In order for the taper to be self releasing, then the value of b should be less than the value of 2a or the value of a₁ a₃. It is also within the scope of my invention to use external elements and hydraulic or pneumatic clamping means to apply a compressive load to the grinding discs. Figure 5 illustrates one type of fluid actuated clamp used to induce compression at the circumference of the abrasive grinding wheel during mounting and in use. As in Figure 2, a conventional wheel 1 is mounted on a drive table 3 by means of a clamping ring 6 attached to the table. However, in Figure 5, the clamping ring retains a fluid expandable tube 21 connected through a valve 22 which may in turn be connected at 23 to a suitable source of pressure to expand the tube, encircling the circumference of the stone, against the clamping ring. The purpose of the clamping ring is to prestress the stones in an even manner as in the embodiments of Figure 1 and Figure 2. Once the desired prestress load is attained, by application of pressure, the valve is closed to retain the prestress during use which gives the capability of counteracting the centrifugal forces in operation as previously illustrated. Size and speed can vary widely in the method of this invention. For example, the grinding wheels may typically range in size from 152 to 914 mm 6 to 36 inches in diameter. The female member of the elements should be designed to withstand the centrifugal and other stresses generated at operating conditions. The method of this invention can be used on compositions of low tensile strength, e.g., soft grade wheels allowing this to be used at high speeds. By making the compressive strength the limiting factor, the useful operating speed can be at an optimum. The optimum speed will vary with the diameter of the grinding discs but typical speeds will range from 1200 3600 RPM. The throughput of ground product that results from the present invention is a function of the wheel diameter. The stone wheels presently in use have a 152 mm 6 inch diameter and generate about 29.5 kg 65 pounds of ground product per hour. By the method of invention was found that using a wheel large enough to produce 158 kg 350 pounds of product per hour are possible. Steel wheels, used in the past for grinding on large diameter wheels, are not hard enough to effectively comminute large volumes. Consequently, steel wheels wear excessively. The throughput of the process is also a function of the speed of rotation of the wheel. While steel wheels in the past could be rotated at 3600 RPM, stone wheels would break apart by centrifugal force at that speed. I prefer a rotation of 3600 RPM for optimum production, but no precise speeds are required. The rotation rate chosen depends on the material being ground, the particle size desired, the incoming material size and composition, etc. The stress on the wheel is squared with the doubling of either the diameter of the wheel or speed of rotation. The size reduction elements used are comprised of two adjustably spaced grinding stones, one in a fixed position and the other rotating. The stones are typically comprised of vitrified silicon carbide. The grit size of the stones can vary from 16 to 120 depending on the fineness desired in the finished product. In order to transport material from the center of the stones to the outer periphery, furrows are required. The furrows may be cut tangentially or radially from the stone center. The number of furrows in the stone will vary depending on the diameter of the stone. In a 178 mm 7 inch diameter stone, for example, six furrows are adequate to produce 100 mesh rubber at a rate of 22.7 kg h 50 lbs h . On large diameter stones, one may use from 8 to 24 furrows. The depth of the furrows can vary from 3.2 to 6.4 mm 1 8 to 1 4 and the width from 6.4 to 12.7 mm 1 4 to 1 2 . The method of this invention can be used to comminute wood pulp, plastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene and polybutylene terephthalates, polycarbonates, Teflon and vulcanized rubber. Comminuting rubber or plastics in the method of this invention generates large amounts of heat. In order to cool and lubricate the stones during grinding, a lubricant is required. Water is an excellent fluid for this purpose and also serves as a carrier for transporting the particles to be carried into the grinding discs. The amount of water required is a function of mill size and throughput. While water is a preferred lubricant and carrier medium, other fluids may also be used such as high boiling organic fluids. The invention is illustrated by the following non limiting specific examples A standard Morehouse colloid mill Model B1400 was used for this test. The size reduction elements of this mill consist of two adjustably spaced grinding stones, one in a fixed position and one rotated at 3600 RPM. Stone mounting for the rotating member is the usual threaded spindle nut arrangement. This rotating stone was removed and a 0.125 1 1 2 per foot taper cut on the outer diameter the smaller diameter at the top by standard methods used in the industry in the manner illustrated in Figure 1. A 178 mm 7 diameter steel ring with a matchiang taper 0.125 1 1 2 per foot on the inner diameter was machined. The metal ring was placed over the wheel and attached to the platen by screws, tapping down the metal ring as the screws were tightened to seat the taper in compression on the wheel. The stones were adjusted to a tight setting and fed a coarse grain pigment. The effluent from the mill had a very smooth consistency equivalent to that obtained by normal mounting as would be expected. The same equipment and procedure described in Example I was repeated except the rotating stone was broken on a diameter into two segments before mounting. Again the mill effluent was examined and found to have the same smooth consistency obtained when using an unbroken stone because the taper compressed the stone to close any crack that would otherwise exist. A standard 305 mm 12 laboratory refiner attrition mill manufactured by Sprout, Waldron Co., Inc. was operated at various speeds up to 3600 RPM. This mill is very similar to the mill described in Example I except the standard size reduction elements are metal plates bolted in place to form both the fixed and rotating discs that are capable of withstanding the higher centrifugal forces which are over four times that in Example I according to the following two laws of physics 1 For a given diameter, the stresses are proportional to the square of the speed. 2 For a given speed, the stresses are proportional to the square of the diameter, e.g. at the 3600 RPM, the 305 mm 12 diameter is two times the 152 mm 6 diameter resulting in four times the stress. While operating this mill on mechanical wood pulp, three passes through were required at the tightest setting to remove mats of fibers in the pulp. The bolted plates were removed from this mill and replaced with abrasive wheels 305 mm 12 in diameter. Both fixed and rotating stones were dressed on the outer diameter with a 0.25 3 per foot taper for mounting with a 356 mm 14 diameter steel ring carrying the female portion of the matching taper. The same mounting method used in Example I to place the wheels in compression was followed. At the tightest setting, pulp, free of mats of fibers, was obtained by one pass through the mill. Again, the rotating stone was broken on a diameter into two segments before mounting. The product was equal to that produced by the integral wheel described in Example III. The metal plates were removed from a model 36 2 production size mill of the same manufacturer and configuration as described in Example III. The outside diameter of two 610 mm 24 wheels were dressed perpendicular to the sides. As shown in Figure 2, a separate metal part 11 with a 0.29 3 1 2 taper per foot on the outer diameter and matching the wheel outside diameter was placed between a 660 mm 26 diameter steel ring carrying the female portion of the taper and the wheel. This assembly was mounted as described in Example I. The rotor carrying the 610 mm 24 wheel at 3600 RPM according to the laws of physics stated in Example III. Clean pulp was produced at production rates with a pass compared with three required for the metal plates just as the case using the laboratory refiner. As in Examples II and IV, the rotating wheel was broken on a diameter into two segments before mounting. One pass on pulp was equivalent to the integral wheel described in Example V. An 203 mm 8 attrition mill manufactured by Bauer Brothers, Model 148 2, was equipped with 178 mm 7 stone grinding discs in a manner similar to that described in Example I and illustrated in Figure I. This mill was powered by a 2.2 kw 30 H.P. motor turning at 3600 RPM. The stones were adjusted to a tight setting and fed 10 mesh whole tire stock at a rate of 18 kg h 40 lbs h . Water was fed to the mill at a rate of 2.27 l h 0.5 gallons min . The effluent was a thick, creamy paste having a particle size of 100 mesh.
