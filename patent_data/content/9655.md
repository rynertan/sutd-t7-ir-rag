## Description
NEW N PYRROLYL PYRIDAZ INEAMINES , PROCESS FOR THEIRMANUFACTURE AND THEIR USE AS ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENTSThe invention relates to new N pyrrolyl pyridazineamine derivatives having antihypertensive activity, to the process for their manufacture and to their use as antihypertensive agents.2 Pyrrol l yl imidazoleamines having antihypertensive effectiveness are known from U.K. Patent No.1408362.3 Hydrazinopyridazines and 4 hydrazino phthalazines having antihypertensive activity are broadly described in the pharmaceutical literature see Progress in Drug Research, vol. 20, page 203 205, edited byE. Jucker, Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, 1976 .The prior literature teaches that blocking of the terminal nitrogen of hydrazine moiety of the 4 hydrazino phthalazines through chemically stable substituents such as alkyl or aryl groups leads to virtually inactive compounds see Progress in Drug Research vol. 4 page 332, edited by E. Jucker, Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, 1962 .The novel compounds which form the first object of this invention are N pyrrolyl pyridazineamine deriva tives of the general formulaEMI2.1 wherein R, R1ssR2, R3, may be the same or different and are independently selected from hydrogen and lower alkyl R4 represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkylamino lower alkyl, di lower alkylamino lower alkyl, lower alkanoyl,halo lower alkanoyl, carbo lower alkoxy or carbobenzyloxy R5 and R6 each independently represent lower alkyl, hydroxy lower alkyl, lower alkoxylower alkyl, lower alkanoyloxy lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, phenyl lower alkyl and substituted phenyl lower alkyl or taken together with the adjacent nitrogen atom represent a saturated 5 6 membered heterocyclic ring which may contain a further heteroatom selected from 0, N and S, and which may bear 1 to 2 substituents selected from lower alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, phenyl lower alkyl, substituted phenyl lower alkyl, hydroxy, hydroxy lower alkyl, and lower alkanoyloxy R7 and R8 represent hydrogen atoms or,taken together, a 1,3 butadienylene radZf. el forming a benzo system fused with the pyridazine rinq The invention includes the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I .In the specification and in the claims the term lower alkyl designate a C1 C4 straight or branched alkyl, preferably methyl and ethyl the term lower alkoxy designate an alkoxy group wherein the aliphatic portion is a straight or branched alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon, preferably a methoxy or an ethoxy group the term lower alkanoyl designates an alkanoyl radical of 1 to 4 carbons, preferably acetyl and propionyl, the term halo lower alkanoyl designates a lower alkanoyl of 2 to 4 carbon atoms with 1 to 3 halo substituents, preferably chloroacetil, fluoroacetil, trichloroacetil and trifluoroacetil the term hydroxy lower alkyl designates a lower alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms with a hydroxy substitution on the chain, prefe rably, 2 hydroxyethyl, 2 hydroxypropyl and 3 hydroxypropyl the terms lower alkylamino lower alkyl and di lower alkylamino lower alkyl designate lower alkyls of 1 to 4 carbon atoms having one Cl C4 alkylami no or di C1 C4 alkylamino substituent such as, for instance, methylami.no, dimethylamino, ethylamino and diethylamino the term lower alkanoyloxy desiqnates an alkanoyloxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably formyloxy, acetyloxy and proprionyloxy the term lower alkoxy lower alkyl designates a group wherein the lower alkoxy portion is defined as before and the lower alkyl portion is an alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon, preferably ethyl and propyl the term lower alkanoyloxy lower alkyl designates a group wherein the lower alkanoyloxy portion is defined as befo re and the lower alkyl portion is an alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon, preferably ethyl and propyl the term lower alkenyl designates an alkenyl of 3 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably allyl the term substituted phenyl represents a phenyl substituted with 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from, cloro, fluoro, bromo, lower alkyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy and methylenedioxy, preferably chlorophenyl, tolyl, methoxyphenyl, dimetoxyphenyl, trimetoxyphenyl, and 3, 4 methylenedioxy phenyl the term substituted phenyl lower alkyl designates a group wherein the substituted phenyl portion is as defined before and the lower alkyl portion is a 1 to 4 carbon alkyl preferably methyl and ethyl representative members of the saturated 5 6 membered heterocyclic rings which may contain a further heteroatom selected form N, 0 and S , are pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, morpholine and thiomorpholine typical examples of substitutions on said heterocyclic rings include lower alkyl,hydroxy, hydroxy lower alkyl and lower alkanoyloxy substituents on the carbon atom moiety of said rings and or lower alkyl, hydroxy lower alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl phenyl lower alkyl, substituted phenyl lower alkyl substituents on the second nitrogen atoms when the ring contains said further heteroatom.The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts refers to non toxic acid addition salts of the compounds the anion of which are relatively innocuous to animals at dosages consistent with good antihypertensive activity so that the beneficial pharmacologi cal effect is not vitiated by the side effects ascribable to the anions.Pharmacologically acceptable salts include those derived from mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid as well as those derived from organic acids such as lactic, maleic, succinic, fumaric, oxalic, glutaric, citric, malic, tartaric, p toluenesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, cycloexanesulfonic acid and the like.The use of the novel N pyrrolyl pyridazineamines as antihypertensive agents refers to all industrially applicable aspects and acts of said use, including the embodying of the novel compounds into pharmaceutical compositions. The pharmaceutical compositions containing said active compounds are in fact a further specific object of this invention. The compounds and the compositions of this invention are useful as antihypertensive agents, that is, when said substances are administered in pharmacologically effective amounts to animals suffering of spontaneous or experimentally induced hypertension, produce a considerable reduction of the blood pressure, without displaying any untolerable side effect.The compounds of this invention have the peculiar characteristic of a long lasting action since a remarkable reduction of the blood pressure in the test animals is still persistent even seven hours after administration.The process for the manufacture of the novel N pyrrolyl pyridazineamines of this invention comprises contacting a hydrazino derivative of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 have the same meanings as above or an acid addition salt thereof with a dicarbonyl compound of the formulaEMI6.1 wherein R, R1, R2 and R3 have the same meanings as above or a functional derivative thereof wherein the keto functions can be easily restored under the reaction conditions. The two reactants are usually contacted in about equimolecular amounts although a 1 to 20 excess of dicarbonyl compound may in some instances positively affect the conversion yields of the hydrazine compound.The reaction is usually carried out in the presence of a solvent such as water, a C1 C4 alkanol, acetic acid, benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofouran, dioxane and mixture thereof, preferably in the presence of an acidic catalyst.Although several type of catalysts such as hydrohalic acids, sulfuric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid and Lewis acids may be employed, lower alkanoic acids are particularly suitable in that they may be used simultaneous ly both as solvents and catalysts. Among the lower alkanoic acids, acetic acid is particularly preferred.In the case where an acid addition salt of the hydrazine of the formula 2 is employed such as thenydrohalides, the dirhydrohalides, the sulfate and the hydrogen sulfate, the addition of a base or of a basic buffering agents to the reaction solution is needed to allow reaction of the hydrazine in the free base form. The reaction temperature is generally ranging between about 10 C and the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably between 150C and 1200 C, most pre ferably between 20 C and 85 C. The reaction time may vary from about 0,5 to about 4 hours during which the reaction course may the monito red by thin layer chromatography. The recovery of the reaction product is carried out according to the general procedures for recovering so lid or oily products from organic solutions. In generic operations, once the reaction is completed, the reaction solution is evaporated to dryness, the residue is slurried with an aqueous solution of a base to remove traces of the acidic catalyst or solvent the residue may be dissolved in an organic solvent and then recovered by concentration and or cooling of the organic solution. The compound thus obtained may be fur ther purified by usual procedures such as crystalliza tion from solvents,column chromatography, preparative thin layer chromatography and similar methods. The acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I may be obtaihed through common procedures from thecorre sponding free bases bt addition of an appropriate acid. The intermediate hydrazines of formula II are prepared according to procedures described in the literature. Some hydrazino pyridazines are specifically described for instance in the following U.K. patents U.K. 1.157.642, U.K. 1.373.548, U.K. 1.299.421 and in the following papers E. Bellasio et al. I1 Farmaco Ed. Sci. 24, 921 1969 G. Pifferi et al. J. Med. Chem. 18, 741 1975 . For preparation of compounds of formula I wherein R4 represents lower alkyl, lower alkanoyl, carbo lower alkoxy , or carbobenzyloxy, besides the general method described above, a further procedure may be advantageously employed in cases where the preparation of the corresponding N alkylated or acylated hydrazine starting material is difficult. This alternative procedure involves preparation of the compounds of formula I whereinR4 is hydrogen which is then alkylated or ácylated on the unsubstituted nitrogen atom by means of common alkylation or acylation procedures.Alkylation may be carried out, for instance, with lower alkyl halides or sulfates in the presence of acid acceptors such as alkali metal hydrides, alkali metal alkoxydes and the like. Acylation may be carried out by reacting the N unsubstituted compound with the appropriate acyl halide or anhydride, optionally in the presence of an acid acceptor such as pyridine.The acyition pr ocedure may also be employed for conversion of free hvdroxv soups to lower acvloxv in the portionEMI8.1 of the compounds of formula t above.Representative example of compounds of this invention are indicated in TABLE I.The antihypertensive activity of the compounds of the invention was shown in representative tests on spontaneous hypertensive rats and in renal hypertensive dogs.In representative experiments with renal hypertensive dogs, effective amounts l to 4 mg kg of compounds of examples 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14 and 15 were administered p.o.to the conscious hypertensive animals. The systolic arterial blood pressure was measured by the indirect method on the tail before and 1, 3, 5 and 7 hours after treatment.The results of these experiments showed that the compounds were effective in lowering the blood pressure. The drop of the systolic blood pressure ranged between 20 and 70 mm Hg, depending on the specific compound tested and on the time at which the blood pressure was observed. In general the antihypertensive effect started about 3 hours after treatment and the maximum effect was still persistent 7 hours after treatment.In representative experiments with spontaneous hypertensive rats MHR Milano hypertensive rats see G. Bianchi et al. Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Phiosiology,Suppl. 3, 15 20, 1976 a 20 to 60 mm Hg systolic blood pressure drop was observed in the test animals administered p.o.with effective 2 to 100 mg kg amounts of the compounds ofExamples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 26. The toxicity of these compounds was found to be very low since the values of the LD50 in mice were generally higher than 500 mg kg p.o. and, in most cases, the LD50 was greater than 800 mg kg p.o. Besides, representative compounds of this invention have shown absence of any mutagenic effect in current mutagenetic in vitro tests See Ames et al. Proc. Natal. Acad. Sci. U.S., 70 782, 1973 .For instance, the compound of example 3 having a value ofLD50 of about 800 kg p.o. provoked a blood pressure drop of 38 mm Hg, when administered at a dose of 5 mg kg to spontaneous hypertensive rats. In renal hypertensive dogs, drops of the systolyc blood pressure of 50 and 70 mm Hg, were observed with of and 4 mg kg p.o. respectively. The hydochloride of said compound of example 3 as well as the compounds of examples 2, 19 and 21 showed analogous results.A surprising and very interesting pharmacological effect showed by these compounds is the persistence of the antihypertensive action even at a considerable period of time after the administration. For instance, the compound of example 3, when administered at a dose of 2 mg kg.to renal hypertensive dogs, showed a maximum systolic blood pressure drop of 52 mm Hg after about three hours and after seven hours a blood pressure drop of 48 mm Hg was still registered.Under the same conditions and at the same dosage, hydralazine l hydrazinophthalazine showed a maximum decrease of the systolic blood pressure of 41 mm Hg after about one hour but, after seven hours, the blood pressure descrease was only of 29 mm Hg.The effect was confirmed in experiments wherein the two substances were administered intravenously at equipotent dosages.Another very remarkable effect of the antihypertensive compounds of this invention is that the maximum blood pressure drop is reached through a gradual decrease which does not dramatically affect all the circulatory parameters concerned, thus avoiding the undesired side effects generally displayed by most of the known antihypertensive substances.The persistence of the antihypertensive effect is a very favorable characteristic of the novel compounds of this invention, since it allows a less frequent administration scte dule and, moreover, the total amount of antihypertensive substance required to keep the blood pressure value at a normal level in chronically hypertensive patients is lower than with other hypertensive substances having the same potency but with a shorter period of action. The following are examples of preparation of representative compounds of this invention given by way of illustration only, without any intention of limiting the present invention.
