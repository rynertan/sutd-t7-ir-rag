## Description
The present invention relates to a method of producing annular explosive charges for explosive jointing of large diameter pipes such as pipelines, and to charges produced according to the method. Explosive jointing may be effected by explosive welding or by some type of shrink joint. As a rule, explosive jointing of large diameter pipes such as pipelines is effected using interiorly placed annular charges which act against an exteriorly placed support or abutment. In order to provide a completely satisfactory joint, the charges must abut quite closely to the inner surface of the pipe. Minor deviations from circular configuration in the pipe may, in such operations, be compensated for in that the charge is made elastically deformable. However, the requirement of a special charge diameter for each pipe diameter remains, as well as the requirement of a good connection between the outside of the charge and the inner surface of the pipe. Moreover, the fact that the charge may not be so elastically deformable that it fails to be self supporting may result in the situation that standard charges cannot always be used in such pipes whose dimensional tolerances lie at the extreme margins of accepted tolerance ranges for the pipe in question. Of necessity, the dimensional tolerances for such large diameter pipes as pipelines are quite broad. Hence, a plurality of different charge dimensions for one and the same type of pipe may be necessary, and this, of course, increases costs. The standard method within the prior art for producing such annular charges intended for explosion welding has been to cast the charges. This is quite a circumstantial procedure if the intention is to produce a plurality of charges of different, but relatively similar, accurately specified outer diameters. The object of the present invention is to offer a practical and versatile method of producing such annular charges by winding a strip shaped elastically deformable flexible flat explosive to form a circular ring of uniform thickness and consisting of a plurality of closely mutually superposed and suitably joined layers of desired outer diameters. If, in this operation, the strip shaped flat explosive is wound, its ends must be bevelled. One method of directly producing such strip shaped flat explosive which is bevelled at its ends is to cast the explosive in a horizontal mould which is progressively shallower towards its ends. The inclination of the shallow sloping in the mould must, in this instance, be equal, at one end, to the thickness of the flat explosive divided by the outer periphery of the currently contemplated charge, and at the other end equal to the thickness of the flat explosive divided by the inner periphery of the currently contemplated charge. Besides, casting in a horizontal mould is probably the best method of producing the flat explosives of the type under consideration here. In this operation, the mould is suitably interiorly coated with silicon or teflon. In this mould, which may be provided with an interlay so as directly to provide the desired strip width which, however, may also be realized by other suitable means, such as by cutting of a large flat explosive panel , the explosive is cast mixed with a suitable binder which, at the same time, reduces the VOD velocity of detonation of the charge, a high density filler to increase the density of the charge, and gas blisters in the form of gas filled microspheres of glass or plastic to reduce the critical diameter of the charge and guarantee reliable total initiation, and possibly also a surface active agent such as lecitine to increase the flow properties of the mixture. Another method of improving the flow properties of the mould mixture so that it flows out to a horizontal layer of uniform thickness in the mould is to employ particulate oomponents as explosive and filler, with a carefully adapted particle size distribution. Concerning other general data relating to charges for explosive jointing of metals, reference is made to our own co pending Swedish patent application Explosive charge and a method for its production SE pat.appln. 8503079 9. As has been mentioned above, the charge should contain a binder. This should be a polymer binder which hardens at room temperature and permits casting of charges. The binder may not have any negative effect on the explosive by an uncontrollable exothermic curing process and must, in the hardened state, impart to the charge desired flexibility such as sufficient elasticity and self bearing properties. As a rule, a content of approx. 50 per cent polymer binder should give the desired properties. Explosives suitable for explosive jointing are primarily pentyl, but also TNT, octogene, hexogene and ammonium nitrate could probably be employed. According to one preferred variation of the present invention, use is made of a polyurethane based binder system comprising of one of the di isocyanates disclosed below or their isomeric mixtures ration 1 1 and a polyhydroxy compound on a Σ caprolacton basis. In the physical application of the method according to the present invention, use may be made, as polyisocyanates, of unitary substances or mixtures thereof. The polyisocyanates must have at least two NCO groups. Polyisocyanates with up to six NCO groups may also be employed. The polyisocyanates may have aliphatic, cyclo aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic molecular structure. As examples of appropriate polyisocyanates, the following might be mentioned 2,4 toluene di isocyanate and 2,6 toluene di isocyanate or their isomeric mixtures diphenylene methane 4,4 di isocyanate, diphenyl dimethyl methane 4,4 di isocyanate, triphenyl 4,4,4 tri isocyanate, phenylene 1,4 di isocyanate 2,2 6,6 tetramethyl diphenyl methane 4,4 di iso cyanate, diphenyl 4,4 di isocyanate, diphenyl ether 4,4 di iso cyanate or their halogen substituted derivates 2,6 di isopropylene 1,3 di isocyanate, m xylene di isocyanate, p xylene di isocyanate, tetramethyl p xylene di isocyanate, dimers of toluene 2,4 di isocyanate, cyclohexane 1, di isocyanate, 1,2,3,4,5,6 hexahydrodiphenyl methane 4,4 di isocyanate, naphtha lene 1,5 di isocyanate. Instead of the above mentioned isocyanates, a multiplicity of additional products with isocyanate end groups may be employed. These additional products are manufactured in such a manner that a polyhydroxy compound is reacted with polyisocyanate in such a ratio that there will be obtained at least two isocyanate groups per molecule in excess. In certain cases, the excess of isocyanate groups may amount to six per molecule. The polyhydroxy compounds usable for the manufacture according to the present invention may be summarized under the heading of polyethers. These polyethers may, in their nature, be based on aliphatic or aromatic molecular structures. The number of hydroxy groups per molecule available for the reaction with the polyisocyanates may vary between from two to six. As examples of such compounds, mention might be made of those as are manufactured frcm aliphatic dioles, trioles, tetroles, pentoles and hexoles, as well as aliphatic diamines as initiators. These aliphatic polyoles and diamines are suitably straight chains containing from two to six carbon atoms. By an addition of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or tetrahydrofurane to the initiators, there will be obtained two to six functional products with molecular weights varying between 100 and 10 000. These above described polyethers are aliphatic compounds. However, for producing the mould compo sitions according to the present invention, use may advantageously also be made of polyethers on an aromatic basis with five or six linked rings. Examples of such compounds are reaction products between ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and tetrahydrofurane, respectively, and di hydroxy diphenylene urethane, di hydroxy di phenylene propane, di hydroxy diphenyl or di hydroxy hydantoin. These aromatic polyethers may be embraced in the following general formulae The molecular weight of these compounds lies between 300 and 800. These above described compounds react with polyisocyanates by polyaddition. The following systems are usable thanks to their low viscosity, low exotherm and long pot life. Isophorone di isocyanate 3 isocyanatomethyl 3,5,5 trimethyl cyclohexyl isocyanate . The NCO content for these isocyanates should lie between 30 and 40 . As polyhydroxy compounds, use is preferably made of polyethers on an Σ caprolactone basis. wherein R may be any OH terminated compound whatever. However, the condition is that the OH group must be Polyesters suffer from the drawback that they are often highly viscous, brittle and give a rapid and high temperature elevation on polymerization. Low viscous polyester systems contain hazardous monomers. The catalyst types used for polymerization of polyesters are inhibited by nitro compounds and nitrate esters. Consequently, polyesters are unsuitable for this purpose. On the other hand, silicons which have elastic properties may be used, at least in certain cases. Moreover, these harden completely at room temperature without rapid exotherms. On the other hand, their price level is clearly disadvantageous as compared with isophorone based polyurethane systems. Moreover, viscosity is often higher for silicon systems. Nor is silicon as strong as polyurethane systems. On the other hand, epoxy resins cannot, as a rule, be employed, since the catalysts are often incompatible with explosive. In order to attain a sufficient degree of cohesion, the different layers of the charge should be glued to one another. This may either be effected using a separate glue or by utilizing the polymer binder. In the first case, the glue surfaces may, for example, be coated with a curing polyurethane which contains an excess of polyol. In the second case, the hardening of the polymer binder may be delayed in its surface layer facing the mould. This may be effected, for example, by coating the inside of the mould with a certain type of silicon rubber which has a hardening inhibiting effect on polyurethane. The glueing of the different layers to one another may also be utilized to divide up the charge by means of inert layers which reduce the VOD of the charge. The charge may also be reinforced by glass fibre matting or other material in conjunction with the moulding of the charge. The nature of the present invention and its aspects have been defined in the appended claims. Referring to the drawings, Fig. 1 shows a first variant of the present invention with a plurality of concentric layers of strip shaped flat explosive, while Fig. 2 shows another type of charge produced frcm helically wound layers of strip shaped flat explosives. On the figures, reference No. 1 designates flat explosive, 2 glue joints and 3 an outer reinforcement and or buffer and 4 a tamping. A suitable thickness for the flat explosive contemplated here may be from 3 to 10 mm. The following components and amounts were mixed Isophoron di isocyanate 15 Polyol 30 Pot life 1 hour Coarse grained pentyl 24 Fine grained pentyl 6 Glass microspheres 3 Zinc powder 21.5 Lecitine 0.5 The components were mixed in vacuum in a planetary type mixer at 10 mm Hg. Thereafter, the composite mass was poured onto a silicon coated substrate. Silicon of the condensation type was employed. After 12 hours, the panel was removed from the mould. Its underside was tacky as has been mentioned above. Pieces were cut out from the panel and were then glued together to form an annular charge according to Fig. 2. This charge was subsequently employed as a patented explosive welding charge. The flat explosive was so elastic that it could be bent to a curvature of 20 mm without cracking.
