# Channel plate electron multiplier.

## Abstract
In a channel plate electron multiplier 1 having a stack of perforated conducting sheets dynodes 2,2 in sulated 3 from one another, electrons incident on the input face of the stack which do not enter the channels give rise to unwanted secondary electrons which move transverse to the channels in the space in front of the stack and enter channels remote from the point of inci dence. This degrades the definition and contrast of an electron image transmitted by the channel plate. A layer of lower secondary emission material 4, which may by an a sheet carrier 5, is provided on the stack input face.
