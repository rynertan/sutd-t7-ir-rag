# Polymerisation process for preparation of non aqueous dispersions of microparticles and coating compositions containing said microparticles.

## Abstract
A process is described for making sterically stabilised non aqueous dispersions of polymer microparticles in which 1 monomers including at least one crosslinking monomer are polymerised in an aqueous medium at a temperature at least 10 higher than the glass transition temperature of the polymer to be formed, in the presence of a block or graft copolymer stabilising agent containing in the molecule, as the component solvated by the aqueous medium, a polymer chain derived from a polyethylene glycol of molecular weight at least 1000, under conditions such that there is at no time present a sepa rate monomer phase and 2 the microparticles thus obtained are transferred into a non aqueous medium which is capable of dissolving the polyethylene glycol in question, when the lat ter is in the non hydrated state, to the extent of at least 10 by weight at room temperature. The microparticles are of value for incorporation into coating compositions the main film forming constituent of which is compatible with the polyethylene gly col derived stabilising chains of the particles.
