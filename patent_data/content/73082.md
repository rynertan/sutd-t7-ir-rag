# Method for manufacturing a measuring capillary.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a measuring capillary, wherein in each of a number of substantially plate shaped parts 1 a recess 2, 3 is formed. The shape of the recesses 2, 3 is such that when said plate shaped parts 1 are superposed with the recesses 2, 3 facing each other, said recesses 2, 3 define the capillary. The walls of the recesses 2, 3 and at least the plate surface portions directly adjacent thereto are coated by a certain substance. The plate shaped parts 1 are superposed such that the recesses 2, 3 formed therein, define together a capillary and the plate shaped parts 1 are fixed to each other.
