# An electron beam exposure method.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method for exposing an electron beam of a beam shaping type, wherein, the electron beam can be shaped into a polygon having a desired size by passing through a first 13 and a second 15 apertures. The position of the first 13 or the second 15 aperture tends to be deviated from its design position due to heat resulting in a deviation of the electron beam. According to the invention, the offset value OF of the real image 14 formed on the second aperture, with respect to the ideal image 14 , is automatically determined by detecting a current passing through the second aperture 15 . During an electron beam exposure for patterning, the amount of deflection of the electron beam is corrected by taking the previously obtained offset value OF into consideration.
