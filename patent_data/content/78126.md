# Tablet dispenser.

## Abstract
A dispenser of dispensing tablets one at a time has a reservoir, a chamber below the reservoir in which the tablets are arranged in a single layer and a dispensing passageway which leads to a disoensing orifice. The passageway is of such a width that a single column of tablets can be accommodated. The passageway is defined by portions of a moving slider member and can be moved from a non dispensing position to a dispensing position. In this latter position the lowermost tablet is dispensed whereas the remaining tablets in the column are retained in the passage way by a fixed protuberance. One side of the passageway is resilient to minimise tablet damage. The slider member is adapted to assist the passage tablets from the reservoir to the chamber.
