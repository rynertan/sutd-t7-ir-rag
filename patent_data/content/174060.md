# Method for growing a single crystal.

## Abstract
Modified liquid encapsulated Czockralski method for growing a single crystal of compound semi conductor. This method uses two vessels. An inner vessel is filled with an inactive gas, a gas of the element of V group composing the compound and an impurity gas, if necessary. An outer vessel is filled only with the inactive gas. Total pressure of the inner atmosphere is equal to or higher than that of the outer atmosphere. Liquid encapsulants cover a material melt in a crucible, openings of the inner vessel for penetrating shafts therethrough. The partial pressure of the gas of the element of group V is bigger than the dissociation pressure of the element of group V near the melting point of the compound semicon ductor.
