# OUTDOOR STOVE

## Abstract
A stove includes a housing having side by side cham bers each of which may be alternately used either as a firebox or an oven. One chamber is located directly under a grill while the other chamber is located under a griddle so that the location of the fire can be selected to obtain the most advantageous heat distribution for the type of cooking engaged in but the arrangement is such that no matter which firebox location is selected, both the grill and the griddle are heated to some extent.
