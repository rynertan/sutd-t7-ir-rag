# Rotary atomizing burner for the combustion of fine grained coal particles suspended in a liquid.

## Abstract
Burner for a suspension of fine grained coal in a liquid, particularly water, which burner operates according to a combination of the rotary burner and toroidal burner princi ples. The fuel is supplied axially behind a transverse distribu tion baffle 12, 31, 55, 65 within a conical rotary body 10, 30, 50, 60 . At least the outer rim portion 13, 62 of the inner side of the rotary body 10, 30, 50, 60 forms an angle of 35 80 with the axis of the burner. At the outer edge 13, 45, 64 of the rotary body there is an annular air supply nozzle 16, 46, 70 for supplying a conically diverging outwardly directed air stream 17, 47 . Outside the air supply nozzle and at a radial distance from it, there is a conical guide baffle 18, 48 which at its outer end may be curved inwardly at 22, 48 and which, together with the diverging air stream, serves to produce a positive recirculation of combustion gases, non combusted coal parti cles and ash particles in a direction back towards the rotary body in accordance with the toroidal burner principle.
