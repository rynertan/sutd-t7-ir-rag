# A hierarchical memory system including separate cache memories for storing data and instructions.

## Abstract
A hierarchical memory system for use with a high speed data processor characterized by having separate dedicated cache memories for storing data and instructions and further characterized by each cache having a unique cache directory containing a plurality of control bits for assisting line replacement with the individual cache memories and for eliminating many accesses to main memory and to insure that unnecessary or incorrect data is never stored back into said main memory. The present cache architecture and control features render broadcasting between the data cache and instruction cache unnecessary. Moditication of the instruction cache is not permitted. Accordingly, control bits indicating a modifi cation in the cache directory for the instruction cache are not necessary and similarly it is never necessary to store instruction cache lines back into main memory since their modification is not permitted. The cache architecture and controls permit normal instruction and data cache fetches and data cache stores. Additionally, special instructions are provided for setting the special control bits provided in both the instruction and data cache directories, independently of actual memory accessing OPS by the CPU and for storing and loading cache lines independently of memory OPS by the CPU.
