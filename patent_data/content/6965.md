## Description
POLYESTER CARBONATES CONTAINING BISPHENOL A AND TRANS 1, 4 CYCLOHEXANE DICARBOXYLIC ACID MOIETIES PROCESS PRODUCTION THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known.to produce polyester carbonate copolymers from bisphenol A and certain dicarboxylic acids, in particular, adipic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. See U.S.P. 3,169,121 of February 9, 1965 toE. P. Goldberg.This patent broadly suggests at column 3, lines 64 70 that the dicarboxylic acid can contain an alkylene, alkylidene, or cycloaliphatic group and cites certain such groups at column 4, lines 7 33 including tetrahydroterephthalic acid, i.e. 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid etc. but no specific teaching of how to make or use polyester carbonate copolymers containing cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid is presented in the patent, or elsewhere in the prior art so far as we are aware. Use of trans 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid for production of alicyclic polybenzoxazinones is disclosed in the publication Die Makromolekulare Chemie, Volume 126 1969 pages 48 55 by Y. Hagiwara et al. It is noted in this article that these alicyclic polymers are colorless whereas the corresponding aromatic polymers are tan or yellow colored page 49, lines beneath the formulas . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have now found specific melt processable polyester carbonate copolymers of bisphenol A hereinafter called BPA and trans 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid hereinafter called CHDA moieties, having desirable properties oE low color, good impact strength and good abrasion resistance. Our polyester carbonate copolymers have viscosity number i.e. specific viscosity divided by concentration of at least 0.6 dl. g. measured at 250C. and 0.5 g. 100cc. concentration in 40 60 weight ratio of tetrachloroethane phenol solvent, and have mole ratio of theBPA CDHA moieties in the range between 2 0.4 and 2 1.3. The molar proportion of carbonate moiety amounts to the difference between BPA and acid moieties. The distribution is essentially random. These copolymers can additionally contain other dibasic acid moieties, in particular moieties of terephthalic TPA and or isophthalic acid in no greater molar proportion than the CHDA moiety. PREFERRED EMOBODIMENTS The examples which follow illustrate preferred embodiments of our invention, but the invention is not intended to be limited by the details of the examples. As seen in the examples, the copolymers of this invention are obtained using excess pyridine over the theoretical 2 1 mole ratio with BPA, and using several fold dilution of the pyridine with dichloromethane.Example 1 132.8 grams of BPA 0.583 mole was dissolved in 140 ml. of pyridine 1280 ml. of dichloromethane DCM solvent. Then 60 grams of trans 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid dichloride CHDC 0.287 mole dissolved in 500 ml of dichloromethane was added slowly at room temperature. To the resulting solution, phosgene was added by bubbling in with good stirring until the solution became viscous. Then the solution, containing precipitated pyridinium hydrochloride, was further diluted with enough DCM to facilitate its filtration through a coarse sintered glass filter. After being filtered on the glass filter, the solution was poured with vigorous stirring into about 3 volumes of acetone whereby it was precipitated. The precipitate was filtered and dried and dissolved in about 2 liters of dichloromethane, to which activated charcoal 2 grams was added. After filtration to remove the charcoal, the polymer was precipitated a second time in acetone as above, and filtered off. Then the polymer was washed with hot water 7008O0 and then with acetone and was filtered and dried. Properties observed for the resulting polymer were BPA CHDA moieties mole ratio by infrared for proportion of ester vs. carbonate carbonyl groups, as determined by using standard mixtures of BPA polycarbonatewith BPA CHDA polyester for calibration . 2 1.1 Viscosity number 1.4 dl. g. Glass transition temperature T 176 C. g Abrasion resistance by falling grit method ASTMNo. D 673 70 expressed as difference in percent haze when measured after vs. before abrasion using 300 ml. grit 17 using 1000 ml. grit 21 . These results can be compared to values for standard commercial polycarbonate, obtained by the same test method, of 300 ml. 27 1000 ml. 41 . The impact strength of the present polyestercarbonate copolymer was at a satisfactory level of 3.2 ft. pounds per inch of notch, as determined upon samples cut from a plaque and compression molded. Such production of a satisfactory test plaque shows that the polymer is melt processable. Observation of the polymer in plaque form, before and after exposure to ultraviolet light, showed that the exposed polymer had practically the same absorption of ultraviolet radiation as did the original polymer and that the polymer before and after exposure was water white in color.Example 2 114 grams of BPA 0.500 mole was dissolved in 120 ml of pyridine and 1000 ml of dichloromethane. A solution containing 20.3 grams of terephthaloyl chloride TPC and 31.1 grams of CHDC dissolved together in 500 ml of dichloromethane was poured slowly several seconds into the BPA solution with good stirring at 25 C. After a few minutes, and just prior to phosgenation 2.5 grams of t butylphenol was added as a molecular weight regulator.Phosgene was then bubbled into the solution with good stirring at 250C until the viscosity reached a maximum and leveled off as judged by visual observation. The feed ratio of ingredients in moles was BPA CHDC TPC phosgene 2.O O.6 O.4 excess over 1. The resulting polymer solution was filtered to remove much of the solid pyridinium hydrochloride. The polymer was isolated as a soft precipitate by pouring the solution as a slow stream with stirring into three volumes of acetone. The precipitate was chopped up in a Waring Blender in 1 1. of methanol, filtered, and washed with water at 70 800C followed by 1 1. of methanol. The polymer was then dried, redissolved in 1.5 1. of dichloromethane, and reprecipitated in acetone as described above. The reprecipitated polymer was chopped up in methanol as above, filtered, and washed with hot water and methanol, and dried, as above. Tg 1750C Viscosity number 0.73 dl. g. Mole ratio of BPA CHDA TPA moieties by infrared, using pure BPA polycarbonate and pure BPA poly ester of CHDA and of TPA for calibration 2 0.5 0.4 In color, this copolymer was light yellow, showing optical density of 2 solution for absorption of visible blue light 400 480 nm wavelength of 0.015 at 480 nm, 0.02 at 450 and 425 nm, and 0.04 at 400 nm these figures are about double the values found for the practically colorless product of Example 1. The T values of 1750C shows a relatively high g resistance at the level of viscosity number 0.73 dl. g. compared to the very similar T and considerably higher g viscosity number 1.4 dl. g. of Example 1.
