# WIRE CUT DISCHARGE MACHINING CONTROLLING METHOD.

## Abstract
A wire cut discharge machining controlling method capable of machining an elliptic tapered surface SCT at the corner where the first and the second tapered surfaces TP₁, TP₂ intersect. This method has the steps of inputting the radius value r of the elliptic tapered surface SCT in addition to position control information for machining the first and second tapered surfaces TP₁, TP₂ , calculating the points Q, R on an instruction passage when the elliptic tapered surface SCT and the first and the second tapered surfaces TP₁, TP₂ make contact with each other from the position control information and the radius value, and machining the elliptic tapered surface SCT , thereby forming the elliptic tapered surface SCT at the corner and forming the first and the second tapered surfaces TP₁, TP₂ at the other part.
