# Etchant for chemical milling a high tungsten content superalloy and process.

## Abstract
Chemical milling of cast superalloys having high tung sten contents is advantageously accomplished with an etchant which consists by volume percent of 40 60 concen trated HNO₃, 0.6 0.8 concentrated HF, 30 70 H₂O, with which is included at least 0.008 moles liter CuSO₄ and 0.0016 0.025 moles liter FeCl₃. Preferably the molar ratio of CuSO₄ to FeCl₃ is 2 1 and etching is accomplished in the range 50 80 C.
