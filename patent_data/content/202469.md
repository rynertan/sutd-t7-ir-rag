# Driving device for signs.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a driving device for signs having movable display screens which are multilateral and simultaneously rotatable by means of a driving unit 20 for providing together a number of continuously recurrent pictures corresponding to the number of sides on the display screens 2 , whereby at least some of the display screens comprise two toothed pulleys of which one is adapted to cooperate with a toothed belt 32 or 33 for transferring the driving power of the drivmg unit 20 from a preceding display screen 2 and the other is adapted to cooperate with another toothed belt 32 or 33 for transferring said driving power to a succeeding display screen 2 . In order to facilitate setting of the display screens 2 relative to each other by facilitating tightening and loosening of said toothed pulleys and by preventing toothed pulleys for the same display screen 2 from rotating relative to each other during setting, both toothed pulleys for the display screen 2 form part of a toothed twin pulley 31 as toothed portions 34, 35 which are non rotatably connected to each other, said toothed twin pulley further comprising a clamping device 36 with clamping members 37, 38 positioned axially outside the toothed portions 34, 35 and at least one clamping means 39 provided on said clamping members 37, 38 , extending transverse to the axis of rotation R of the toothed twin pulley 31 and by tightening adapted to clamp the clamping device 36 on a shaft journal 11 on the display screen 2 .
