## Description
The present invention is in the fields of genetic engineering and plant husbandry, and especially provides means for promotion of transcription in and selectable markers for both plants and bacteria. Following are publications which disclose background information closely related to the present invention. These publications are discussed in greater depth in the Background sections indicated. M. W. Bevan EP A 122791, EP A 140556, EP A 142924, EP A 145338 and EP A 140504 disclose the use of promoters from octopine type Ti plasmids to obtain expression of foreign structural genes in plants. Shuttle vectors, developed by G. B. Ruvkun and F. M. Ausubel 1981 Nature A shuttle vector consists of a DNA molecule, usually a plasmid, capable of being introduced into the ultimate recipient bacteria having a replicon that can be maintained independently therein. It also includes a copy of the fragment of the recipient genome into which the foreign genetic material is to be inserted and a DNA segment coding for a selectable trait, which is also inserted into the recipient genome fragment. The selectable trait marker is conveniently inserted by transposon mutagenesis The shuttle vector can be introduced into the ultimate recipient cell, typically a bacterium of the family Rhizobiaceae which contains the genus After the shuttle vector is introduced into the recipient cell, possible events include a double cross over with one recombinational event on either side of the marker. This homogenotization event will result in transfer of a DNA segment containing the marker to the recipient genome replacing a homologous segment lacking the insert. To select for cells that have lost the original shuttle vector, the shuttle vector must be incapable of replicating in the ultimate host cell or be incompatible with an independently selectable plasmid pre existing in the recipient cell. One common means of arranging this is to provide in the third parent another plasmid which is incompatible with the shuttle vector and which carries a different drug resistance marker. Therefore, when one selects for resistance to both drugs, the only surviving cells are those in which the marker on the shuttle vector has recombined with the recipient genome. If the shuttle vector carries an extra marker, one can then screen for and discard cells that contain plasmids resulting from a single cross over event between the shuttle vector and the recipient plasmid resulting in cointegrates in which the entire shuttle vector is integrated with the recipient plasmid. If the foreign genetic material is inserted into or adjacent to the marker that is selected for, it will also be integrated into the recipient plasmid as a result of the same double recombination. It might also be carried along when inserted into the homologous fragment at a spot not within or adjacent to the marker, but the greater the distance separating the foreign genetic material from the marker, the more likely will be a recombinational event occurring between the foreign genetic material and marker, preventing transfer of the foreign genetic material. If the shuttle vector is used to introduce a phenotypically dominant trait e.g. a novel expressible insecticide structural gene, but not an inactivated oncogenic T DNA gene one need not rely on a double homologous recombination. The cells resulting from a single cross over event resulting in cointegrate plasmids can transfer the desired trait into plant cells A. Caplan Shuttle vectors have proved useful in manipulation of Agrobacterium plasmids see D. J. Garfinkel A recently disclosed variation of the shuttle vector system for inserting changes into large DNA molecules is the suicide vector . In this system, as described by A. Puhler An alternative to the use of homologous recombination for introduction of novel DNA sequences into T DNA involves bacterial transposons. As described in the section Agrobacterium Genes on the TIP Plasmids, transposons can jump into the T DNA of a TIP plasmid e.g. see D. J.

Transposons can be easily inserted using this technology D. J. Garfinkel Deletions can be generated in a TIP plasmid by several methods.

In plant cells, a bacterial kanamycin resistance gene from Tn5 is not transcribed under control of its own promoter J. D. Kemp N. Murai A. J. de Framond Chilton One object of this invention is to provide means for promoting the expression of structural genes within both plant cells and bacterial cells wherein said genes are foreign to said cells and would not be expressed otherwise. In pursuance of this goal, a dual purpose promoter region foreign structural gene combination is provided, which is a DNA sequence capable of controlling structural gene transcription within plant and bacterial cells combined with a structural gene which confers an identifiable phenotype to a cell transformed by the combination. According to the invention, the dual purpose promoter region is derived from an octopine type Ti plasmid. Another object is provide specialized plant tissues and plants having within them proteins encoded by foreign structural genes and, in cases where the protein is an enzyme, having or lacking metabolites or chemicals which respectively are not or are otherwise found in the cells in which the genes is inserted. Other objects include providing means for preliminarily testing and otherwise screening in prokaryotes constructions designed for eukaryotic expression, and providing means whereby transformed cells, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, may be identified. Further objects and advantages will become evident from the following description. The invention disclosed herein provides a plant comprising a genetically modified plant cell having a foreign structural gene introduced and expressed therein under control, in the preferred embodiment, of a T DNA 1450bTx derived plant expressible transcriptional control sequence. Further, the invention provides plant tissue comprising a plant cell having a genome comprising a foreign structural gene inserted in such orientation and spacing with respect to T DNA derived plant expressible transcriptional control sequences as to be expressible in the plant cell under control of those sequences. Also provided are novel strains of bacteria containing and replicating T DNA, the T DNA being modified to contain an inserted foreign structural gene in such orientation and spacing with respect to a T DNA derived plant and bacterium expressible promoter region as to be expressible in a plant or bacterial cell under control of said promoter region. Additionally, the invention provides novel vectors useful in efforts to transform plants having the ability to replicate in bacteria and comprising T DNA, and further comprising a foreign structural gene inserted within T DNA contained within the vector, in such manner as to be expressible in a plant cell or a bacterium under control of the T DNA derived promoter region. Furthermore, strains of bacteria harboring said vectors are disclosed. The experimental work presented herein describes a DNA molecule having promoter activities that cause transcription both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes of a single copy of a structural gene. The availability of dual purpose promoter region foreign structural gene combinations will facilitate those of ordinary skill in the art of plant transformation to express foreign structual genes and to engage in other manipulations of DNA sequences. The ability to express a foreign structural gene in a prokaryote before transformation into a eukaryote permits one to functionally test a recombinant DNA construction towards ascertaining whether said construction has been properly assembled. Further utility of this promoter region is evident when it is used to control expression of a genetic marker. When the marker provides a resistance or tolerance to a selective agent, e.g. an antibiotic, that is toxic to both plant and bacterial cells, a single DNA sequence comprising the promoter region and the foreign structural gene can be used to identify or select transformed cells, whether such cells are bacteria or are from plants. Dual purpose promoter region structural gene combinations are especially useful where the combination is the sole means for expression in a cell of an identifiable phenotype conferred by the structural gene. Use of a single DNA sequence for two purposes, selection or screening in plants and selection or screening in bacteria, enables one to decrease the size of DNA molecules which carry such marker, thereby facilitating recombinant DNA manipulations and cell transformation processes. The present invention comprises foreign structural genes under control of a dual purpose promoter region and a polyadenylation site, said promoter gene polyadenylation site combination being inserted into a cell by any means known to the art. More specifically, in its preferred embodiment the invention disclosed herein further comprises expression in plant and bacterial cells of foreign structural genes under control of a certain T DNA derived plant expressible transcriptional control sequence, the 1450bTxPR, after introduction via T DNA, that is to say, by inserting the foreign structural gene into T DNA under control of the 1450bTxPR and ahead of a polyadenylation site and introducing the T DNA containing the insert into a plant cell using known means. Once plant cells expressing a foreign structural gene under control of a dual purpose promoter region are obtained, plant tissues and whole plants can be regenerated therefrom using methods and techniques well known in the art. The regenerated plants are then reproduced by conventional means and the introduced genes can be transferred to other strains and cultivars by conventional plant breeding techniques. The invention in principle applies to any introduction of a foreign structural gene into any plant species into which foreign DNA in the preferred embodiment T DNA can be introduced by any means and in which said DNA can remain stably replicated. In general, these taxa presently include, but are not limited to, dicotyledenous plants such as sunflower family Compositeae , tobacco family Solanaceae , alfalfa, soybeans, and other legumes family Leguminoseae , cotton family Malvaceae , and most vegetables. The invention is useful for genetically modifying bacteria, plant cells, plant tissues, and whole plants by inserting useful structural genes from other species, organisms, or strains. Such useful structural genes include, but are not limited to, genes conveying identifiable phenotypes such as the following improved tolerance to extremes of heat or cold improved tolerance to anaerobic conditions e.g. water logging , drought, or osmotic stress improved resistance or tolerance to insect e.g. insecticidal toxins such as the The present invention additionally includes sub Ti plasmids having foreign structural genes transcribed under control of the 1450bTx promoter region. The use of sub Ti plasmids containing the direct repeats involved in incorporation of the T DNA into the plant genome and one or more opine synthesizing genes can have the following useful results 1.

The following definitions are provided, in order to remove ambiguities to the intent or scope of their usage in the specification and claims. DNA fragment designations are defined in Figures 1 and 2. Production of a genetically modified cell expressing a dual purpose promoter region foreign structural gene combination combines the specific teachings of the present disclosure with a variety of techniques and expedients known in the art. In most instances, alternative expedients exist for each stage of the overall process. The choice of expedients depends on variables such as the choice of the basic vector system for the introduction and stable maintenance of the dual purpose combination, the plant species to be modified and the desired regeneration strategy, and the particular foreign structural gene or promoter sequences to be used, all of which present alternative process steps which those of ordinary skill are able to select and use to achieve a desired result. For instance, although the starting point for obtaining a dual purpose promoter region is exemplified in the present application by T DNA isolated from pTiA6, DNA sequences of other homologous Ti plasmids might be substituted as long as appropriate modifications are made to the promoter region isolation and manipulation procedures. Often, pTi15955 may be used without modification. Dual purpose promoter regions other than that derived from the 1450bTx gene taught herein may be discovered or constructed. Homologous genes may be identified by those of ordinary skill in the art by the ability of homologous nucleic acids to cross hybridize under conditions of appropriate stringency or by comparison of nucleic acid or protein sequences, as is well understood in the art. It will be understood that there may be minor sequence variations within gene sequences utilized or disclosed in the present application. These variations may be determined by standard techniques to enable those of ordinary skill in the art to manipulate and bring into utility the promoter regions of such homologous genes. As novel means are developed for the stable insertion of foreign genes in plant cells, those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select among those alternate process steps to achieve a desired result. The fundamental aspects of the invention are the nature of the dual purpose promoter region and its use to drive expression of a single copy of a foreign structural gene in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Other aspects include the nature and structure of the foreign structural gene and its means of insertion and expression in bacterial and plant genomes. The remaining steps of the preferred embodiment for obtaining a genetically modified plant include inserting the 1450bTxPR structural gene combination into T DNA, monitoring expression in bacteria, transferring the modified T DNA to a plant cell wherein the modified T DNA becomes stably integrated as part of the plant cell genome, techniques for A principal feature of the present invention in its preferred embodiment is the construction of a T DNA derivative having an inserted foreign structural gene under control of the 1450bTxPR, i.e., between a dual purpose promoter region and a polyadenylation site, as these terms have been defined, As will be understood by persons skilled in the art, other sites may be substituted for the Persons practicing the art of plant transformation will be aware of numerous situations where structural genes are advantageously expressed in bacterial hosts as well as in plant cells. However, use of the 1450bTxPR to drive expression of genes that function as genetic markers for identification and or selection of transformed cells is particularly advantageous and is exemplified herein Example 4 . Transformation of cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, is most easily accomplished when one has a means for readily identifying cells transformed by a particular recombinant DNA molecule carrying the marker and linked DNA sequences. Use of the 1450bTxPR to effect expression of a single marker saves those of ordinary skill the trouble of inserting a second marker into a transformation vector. Additionally, lack of a second marker allows construction of transformation vectors smaller than would be otherwise possible, thereby facilitating DNA manipulations, increasing transformation efficiencies, and the like. However, when a particular marker is placed behind the 1450bTxPR, one must be aware of homologous sequences elsewhere in a plasmid that may lead to genetic rearrangements, as is well understood in the art. For example, a Persons practicing the art of plant transformation will be aware of numerous situations where structural genes are advantageously expressed in bacterial hosts as well as in plant cells. However, use of the 1450bTxPR to drive expression of genes that function as genetic markers for identification and or selection of transformed cells is particularly advantageous and is exemplified herein Example 4 . Transformation of cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, is most easily accomplished when one has a means for readily identifying cells transformed by a particular recombinant DNA molecule carrying the marker and linked DNA sequences. Use of the 1450bTxPR to effect expression of a single marker saves those of ordinary skill the trouble of inserting a second marker into a transformation vector. Additionally, lack of a second marker allows construction of transformation vectors smaller than would be otherwise possible, thereby facilitating DNA manipulations, increasing transformation efficiencies, and the like. However, when a particular marker is placed behind the 1450bTxPR, one must be aware of homologous sequences elsewhere in a plasmids that may lead to genetic rearrangements, as is well understood in the art. For example, a As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, the dual purpose promoter region foreign structural gene combination may be placed between any restriction sites convenient for removing the combination from the plasmid it is carried on and convenient for insertion into the plant transformation or shuttle vector of choice. Location of the dual purpose combination insertion site within T DNA is not critical as long as the transfer function of sequences immediately surrounding the T DNA borders are not disrupted, since in prior art studies these regions appear to be essential for insertion of the modified T DNA into the plant genome. Preferred insertion sites are those which lie in areas that are most actively transcribed, in particular T A convenient means for inserting a dual purpose combination and any desired linked DNA into T DNA involves the use of a shuttle vector, as described in the Background, having segments of T DNA those segments between which insertion is desired incorporated into a plasmid capable of replicating in Following the strategy just described, the modified T DNA can be transferred to plant cells by any technique known in the art. For example, this transfer is most conveniently accomplished either by direct infection of plants with the novel An alternative to the shuttle vector strategy involves the use of plasmids comprising T DNA or modified T DNA, into which a dual purpose combination is inserted, said plasmids being capable of independent replication in an Although the preferred embodiment of this invention incorporates a T DNA based Regeneration of transformed cells and tissues is accomplished by resort to known techniques. An object of the regeneration step is to obtain a whole plant that grows and reproduces normally but which retains integrated T DNA. The techniques of regeneration vary somewhat according to principles known in the art, depending upon the origin of the T DNA, the nature of any modifications thereto and the species of the transformed plant. Plant cells transformed by an Ri type T DNA are readily regenerated, using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill, without undue experimentation. Plant cells transformed by Ti type T DNA can be regenerated, in some instances, by the proper manipulation of hormone levels in culture. Preferably, however, the Ti transformed tissue is most easily regenerated if the T DNA has been mutated in one or both of the The genotype of the plant tissue transformed is often chosen for the ease with which its cells can be grown and regenerated in The following Examples utilize many techniques well known and accessible to those skilled in the arts of molecular biology and manipulation of TIPs and Textual use of the name of a restriction endonuclease in isolation, e.g. Plasmids, and only plasmids, are prefaced with a p , e.g., pTi15955 or pUC13, and strain designations parenthetically indicate a plasmid harbored within, e.g., Other plasmids and strains are widely available and accessible to those in the art. This Example discloses and discusses results of transcript mapping experiments which located the 1450 base transcript 1450bTx and also teaches the methods used to obtain said results. These experimental results are essentially excerpted from S. J. Karcher Figure 1 shows a restriction endonulcease map of part of pTiA6 indicating the regions of the Ti plasmid which are stably integrated into plant DNA the T DNA . Subfragments of To define more precisely the boundaries and the polarities of the 1450bTx, S₁ nuclease mapping experiments were performed. Fragments to be used as probes for S₁ nuclease protection experiments were cloned in both orientations into vectors derived from the single stranded bacteriophage M13 see Example 1.3b . The use of such M13 derived single stranded DNA had advantages over the use of double stranded DNA as probes for S₁ nuclease analysis. Hybridization between DNA and RNA could be performed at 65 C in an aqueous solution in a relatively short time. In addition, because cloning into M13 separates the strands of DNA from one another, each strand could be tested separately for protection from S₁ nuclease digestion by RNA. By determining which cloned DNA strand was protected and the orientation of the insert cloned into the M13 multiple cloning site, the polarity of transcription of the RNA could be inferred. When both strands of a given region were protected, transcription in both directions was indicated. The results of such an analysis, using E9 total cellular RNA, are shown in Figure 2. By using d₁ d₂ as an S₁ nuclease protection probe, it was determined that the 1450bTx begins about 240 bp to the right of the Using Northern blotting and S₁ nuclease analysis, five transcripts encoded by the T An S₁ nuclease mapping procedure was used to determine the direction of transcription of these RNAs and to localize their 5 and 3 termini more precisely than is possible with blotting experiments. The S₁ nuclease protection data indicated that the gene encoding the 1450 base RNA does not contain any detectable intervening sequences. The transcript size determined by Northern blotting analysis was larger than the size indicated by the S₁ nuclease analysis. This difference in size is easily accounted for by the posttranscriptional addition of a poly A sequence. The Northern blot and S₁ nuclease protection data corresponded well with DNA sequence data of this region derived by others R. F. Barker Crown gall tumor lines were grown at 25 C under constant illumination on MS3 medium either without for suspension cultures or with for callus cultures 1.0 phytagar M. F. Thomashow Regions of Tumor RNA was isolated as previously described S. B. Gelvin Agarose gel electrophoresis through denaturing formaldehyde gels, blotting onto nitrocellulose, and hybridization were as described Gelvin Hybridizations between recombinant M13 single stranded DNA and E9 suspension RNA were performed in 20 30µl of 5 x SSC, 20mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 at 65 C. Typically, 500ng of recombinant phage DNA were hybridized with 20µg of total RNA isolated from E9 suspension cultures. After 5 hr, the volume was brought to 150µl with cold S After incubation at 20 C, the precipitates were collected, dissolved in 20µl of alkaline buffer 30mM NaOH, 2mM Na₂ EDTA , and the fragments subjected to electrophoresis on 1.2 or 2.0 alkaline agarose gels M.

A kanamycin resistance is not susceptable to the action of either enzyme. The ligation mixture was transformed into The pUC13KanBgl Sma and pRK290Eco13ΔCla were linearized by digestion to completion with pRK290 based plasmids are fairly large more than 20 kbp and are therefore often difficult to handle while doing recombinant DNA manipulations. The construction of two plasmids which replicate pRK290Kan 1 DNA was digested to completion with pRK290Kan 1 DNA was digested with The pUC series of plasmids e.g. pUC13 based plasmids cannot be mobilized for conjugal transfer from pVic1 and pBR322 DNA, each digested by pUC13Kan 1 DNA and pBR322 DNA, each digested by This Example discloses the unexpected result that, when placed behind the 1450bTx promoter region, the bacterial structural gene for kanamycin resistance was expressed in both eukaryotic cells, specifically plant cells, and in prokaryotic cells, specifically A348 pRK290Kan 1 was homogenotized into pTiA6 and used to transform plant cells. The upward facing end of inverted sunflower hypocotyl sections see K. A. Barton This Example teaches the unexpected result that eukaryotic structural genes placed behind the 1450bTx promoter region are expressed in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Lectins are nutritionally important seed protens and are thought to be important during establishment of legume pRK290Lec 1 DNA is transfered into A348 pTiA6 by either transformation or matings followed by introduction of pPH1J1 to exclude independent pRK290 replicons and selection for tetracycline resistant cells. For expression of the lectin gene, homogenotes need not be isolated but, if desired, may be identified by screening the descendants of tetracycline resistant cointegrates by restriction enzyme analysis. TIP plasmids resulting from either cointegration or homogenotization events of pTiA6 with pRK290Lec 1 are designated herein as pTiA6Lec 1. RR1 pRK290Lec 1 and A348 pTiA6Lec 1 are screened by electrophoretic and hybridization methods and are observed to contain the appropriate plant RNA sequences. A348 pTiA6Lec 1 is inoculated onto inverted sunflower stems and the resultant crown gall tumors are observed by hybridization, electrophoretic, and immunological methods, known to those of ordinary skill in the art, to contain lectin mRNA and protein sequences. This Example teaches the construction of sub Ti plasmids which include all of T pRK290Kan 1 was transferred into A348 pTiA6 by means of transformation. After homogenotization, which deletes the 1450bTx structural gene and results in an opine synthesis phenotype, Ti plasmid DNAs isolated from kanamycin resistant pUC13Bam2Kan 1 and pRK290 DNAs are respectively digested with The vector described in Example 6.1 is based on Other enzymes such as Mini Ti plasmids may similarly be constructed by use of the enzymes In order to reduce the size of the sub Ti plasmids discussed herein, smaller vectors may be substituted for pRK290. Plasmids other than those referenced in Background Shuttle Vectors that can be maintained in Triparental matings were generally accommplished as described below other variations known to those skilled in the art are also acceptable.
