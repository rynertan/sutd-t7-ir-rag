# X ray intensifying screens based on phosphor mixtures.

## Abstract
X ray intensifying screens with improved speed and image sharpness can be made from a phosphor mixture of calcium tungstate and a rare earth, e.g. yttrium, tantalate. The tanta late phosphor may be further activated with rare earths.
