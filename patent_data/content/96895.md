# POSITIVE TYPE RADIATION SENSITIVE ORGANIC HIGHPOLYMER MATERIAL AND METHOD OF FORMING FINE PATTERN BY USING THE SAME

## Abstract
A positive type radiation sensitive copolymer of at least two aliphatic aldehyde monomers having the general formula R CHO wherein R denotes an alkyl group, a halogenated alkyl group, an aralkyl group or a halogenated aralkyl group. Exhibit ing high sensitivity to high energy radiation, is used for the for mation of fine patterns required for producing semiconductor devices, magnetic bubble memory devices, integrated circuits, etc.
