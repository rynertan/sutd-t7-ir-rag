## Description
This invention relates generally to vehicles for lifting and transporting loads by air. For convenience, a vehicle of this type will hereinafter be referred to as an air vehicle . So called Alighter than air air ships and balloons are well known for load carrying purposes. An aircraft of this type relies on helium or some other gas which is lighter than air to create lift. Hot air balloons are also well known and rely for buoyancy on the natural tendency of air to rise as its density decreases on heating.Generally, these known type of craft are difficult to control with precision and have not found wide application for commercial load lifting and transporting purposes. United States Patent literature contains numerous examples of prior art proposals for transporting loads by air. For example, the following patents disclose proposals for using air ships and balloons in logging operations U.S. Patent No. 3,221,897 Matheson U.S. Patent No. 3,249,237 Stewart U.S. Patent No. 3,270,895 Stewart U.S. Patent No. 3,369,673 Mosher The following United States patents disclose prior art proposals for lighter than air balloons of generally annular form U.S. Patent No. 3,941,384 Wopschall U.S. Patent No. 1,572,187 Cooper U.S. Patent No. 213,603 Apraxine U.S. Patent No. 3,558,083 Conley et al. Proposals for jet propelled air vehicles are to be found in United States Patents Nos. 3,053,483 Stahmer and 3,152,777 McLean . Eshoo U.S. Patent No. 4,326,681 discloses an example of a non rigid air ship which relies for lift on both heated air and on a gas which is lighter than air. Batchelor U.S. Patent No. 3,658,278 discloses a load transporting system in which a balloon supports a flexible electric line leading from a source of electricity to a load carrying device including a helium filled rotor and means for releasing gas to provide a load carrying force. An object of the present invention is to provide an air vehicle suitable for use in commercial load carrying operations. The vehicle provided by the invention includes an envelope having the general shape of a torus extending about a passageway between top and bottom surfaces of the envelope. The envelope contains a gas, preferably a lighter than air gas. Fan means is carried by the envelope and is arranged to direct air downwardly through the passageway to generate a downwardly vectored thrust for lifting the vehicle. The fan means is controllable to vary the magnitude of the thrust and hence the altitude of the vehicle in flight. The envelope also carries propulsion means for generally lateral propulsion of the vehicle. In a preferred embodiment, the vehicle provided by the invention derives lift both from the lighter than air gas within the envelope and from the thrust provided by the fan means. It is believed that this provision for lift from two sources will permit the design of a vehicle which is not only capable of lifting relatively heavy loads but in which the altitude of the vehicle can be easily and precisely controlled in use. It is also believed that it will be possible to build and operate such a vehicle quite economically. For example, the vehicle may be designed so that the gas within the envelope provides sufficient lift to support the weight of the vehicle when unloaded. The fan means need then generate only sufficient thrust to be capable of lifting the load to the required altitude. In another case, the gas could provide positive buoyancy for the unloaded vehicle although this may then require the addition of means for tethering or anchoring the vehicle when unloaded. The gas within the envelope is preferably, but not essentially, a lighter than air gas such as helium for example, air could be used in the envelope. In this event means may be provded for heating the air to provide lift. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the vehicle includes means for controlling the direction of the thrust vector provided by the fan means, to control the attitude of the vehicle. A further embodiment provides means for generating additional lift by the so called wing effect of air flowing over the top surface of the envelope into the passageway through the envelope. In order that the invention may be more clearly understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings which illustrate a number of preferred embodiments of the invention by way of example, and in which Fig. I is a perspective view from above of an air vehicle in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is an underneath perspective view corresponding to Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a vertical sectional view through the vehicle shown in Figs. 1 and 2 Fig. 4 is an underneath perspective view of a vehicle in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention Fig. 5 is a plan view corresponding to Fig. 4, partly in section Fig. 6 is a vertical sectional view through the vehicle shown in Figs. 4 and 5 Fig. 7 is a vertical sectional view on line 7 7 ofFig. 6 Fig. 8 is a view generally similar to Fig. 4 illustrating an air vehicle in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention Fig. 9 is a vertical sectional view on line 9 9 ofFig. 8 Fig. 10 is an enlarged detail view of part of Fig.9 Fig. 11 is an underneath plan view in the direction of the arrow denoted 11 in Fig. 9 and, Fig. 12 is a plan view of a trim control system of the air vehicle, shown separately from the vehicle. Referring first to Figs. 1 to 3 an air vehicle is generally denoted by reference numeral 20 and includes an envelope 22 having the general shape of a torus. A passageway generally denoted 24 extends between top and bottom surfaces 26 and 28 respectively of the envelope. The envelope contains a gas which is lighter than air in practice, helium . Fan means shown in Figs. 1 and 3 and denoted generally 30 are carried by the envelope and arranged to direct air downwardly through passageway 24 to generate a downwardly vectored thrust for lifting the envelope. In this case, two fans 32 and 34 are provided and are driven individually by respective jet engines 36 and 38. The engines can be controlled to vary the magnitude of the thrust and hence the height of the vehicle in flight, in known manner. The vehicle is provided with a pair of propulsion units in the form of jet engines 42 and 44 which are carried by the envelope and arranged for propelling the vehicle generally laterally. Referring now more specifically to Fig. 3, the envelope 22 comprises essentially a non rigid gas impervious bag 46 having the general shape of a torus the bag is normally maintained in an inflated condition by helium gas under pressure. Bag 46 is made of a polymeric material, in this embodiment the material sold under the trade markMYLAR. A saddle, the shape of which can perhaps best be seen in Fig. 1 extends across the top of the bag and provides a support for the fans 30 and 32 and the engines by which they are driven. The saddle is generally indicated by reference numeral 48 and includes an elongate center portion 48a which extends generally diamentrally of the torus and by which the fans 32, 34 and the engines 36, 38 are supported. Continuations 48b of the center portion 48a extend part way down the sides of the bag and carry the engines 42 and 44. The engines are disposed generally on a median plane through the torus. The saddle also includes an annular portion 48c which overlies the top of the bag 46 and in effect defines the top surface of the torus. As can best be seen in Fig. 3, this annular portion 48c also extends partially down the inside surface of the torus defining the opening 24 to the edge denoted 48d in Fig. 3. Adjacent the bottom of passageway 24 is a second annular member denoted 50 which is also of an arcuate shape in cross section conforming generally to the curvature of bag 46. The bag is secured by adhesive to the bottom member 50 and to the saddle 48 sb that the member and saddle partially support the bag in its inflated condition. Saddle 48 and member 50 are bonded structures typically formed from an epoxy resin matrix and aramid fibers such as those sold under the trade mark KEVLAR. Glass and or carbon fibers may also be incorporated. Other alternative materials are aluminum and titanium. An air bag 52 is provided inside the torus 22 and comprises a closed tubular structure disposed generally on the center line of the torus and maintained in position by supporting wires indicated at 54. Bag 52 contains air and can be inflated or deflated to control the buoyancy of the envelope, as is conventional in air ships. When the air bag 52 is inflated the density of the helium within the bag 46 is increased, reducing its buoyancy. Conversely, deflation of air bag 52 allows the density of the helium to decrease, increasing its buoyancy. A suitable air pump, power source and control equipment will of course be provided in the vehicle for inflating and deflating the air bag 52.This equipment will be carried from the saddle 48 of the vehicle but, for simplicity, has not been shown since it forms no part of the present invention and is similar to equipment conventionally used in air ships. t vh continued reference to Fig. 3, it will be seen that each of the lift fans 32, 34 is supported on saddle 48 above an associated duct, 56, 58 extending downwardly from the saddle. The two ducts 56, 58 merge at a circular chamber 60 generally at the center of the torus 22 Chamber 60 contains two stacked, contra rotating, freewheeling fans 62, 64 rotatable about the center line of chamber 60. These fans are designed to turn in opposite directions under the influence of air from the fans 32, 34 and serve to mix the air into a uniform, downwardly directed stream. That stream enters a discharge duct within a somewhat conically shaped duct member 66, in the center of which is suspended a bell shaped duct member 68.The two members define therebetween a narrow duct 70 which is generally of hollow conical shape and which defines an annular air outlet nozzle 72 at the bottom of the torus.Accordingly, air leaves nozzle 72 in an annular stream or curtain around the perimeter of the bell member 68. Member 68 is suspended at its apex from a universal joint 74 carried at the lower end of a shaft about which the two fans 62 and 64 rotate. The universal joint 74 allows the bell member 68 to be deflected laterally with respect to the outer member 66 to vary the shape of nozzle 72 and hence the configuration of the curtain of air issuing from the nozzle. By changing the configuration of the air stream in this way, the attitude of the vehicle can be controlled in flight. This is accomplished by three actuators mutually spaced at 1200 about the perimeter of nozzle 72. Two of those actuators are visible in Fig. 3 and are denoted by reference numeral 76. Referring to the actuator which is seen at the right in Fig. 3, each actuator is carried by the outer duct member 66 and includes an operating member 78 which extends inwardly and is coupled to the bell member at its outer end.Each actuator comprises a fast acting stepping motor operated by suitable control equipment not shown carr ied by the saddle 48 of the vehicle. In an alternative embodiment, the actuator 76 could be replaced by other forms of actuator, for example, hydraulic cylinders. The duct assembly comprising the ducts 56, 58, chamber 60 and the members 66 and 70 may all be formed as bonded structures from the same materials as the saddle 48 and bottom member 50. Guy wires 79 stabilize the duct assembly with respect to the saddle 48 and bottom member 50. The two jet engines 36 and 38 are located within respective housings 80 and 82 at the underside of the center portion 48a of saddle 48 and have suitable vents 84 and 86.The engines themselves are essentially conventional aircraft type jet engines connected through suitable gearboxes to respective drive shafts 88 and 90 coupled to the associated fans 32 and 34 respectively. Suitable, angle drives 92 and 94 connect the drive shafts to the fan axles. The universal joint 74 at the apex of the bell member 68 is also used as an attachment point for suspending loads from the vehicle. As shown in Fig. 3, an attenuator 96 is suspended from the universal joint 74 and extends downwardly from the vehicle as indicated by line 98 for attachment of loads below the vehicle. Attentuator 96 takes the form of a hydraulic cylinder and performs a shock absorbing function in the suspension line. Typically, the attentuator will be quite short and a cable or other suspension element will extend downwardly from the attentuator for actually carrying the load. The two engines 42 and 44 for propelling the vehicle laterally through the air are also essentially conventional jet engines and are positioned at diametrally opposite sides of the torus for use in maneuvering the vehicle. The engines are reversible. Reference will now be made to Figs. 4, 5 and 6 in describing a second embodiment of the invention. In those views, primed reference numerals will be used to denote parts corresponding with parts shown in Figs. 1 to 3. The vehicle shown in Figs. 4 to 6 has the same principal components as the vehicle shown in the previous views, namely a torus shaped envelope 22 defining a central passageway 24 , fan means 30 , and propulsion means, in this case represented by four generally laterally directed jet engines individually denoted 100. Referring primarily to Fig. 6, it will be seen that the torus shaped envelope 22 r is generally similar to the envelope 22 of the previous views although of somewhat different cross sectional shape, and that the saddle 48 of the previous embodiment has been omitted. The torus itself may be of the same construction as in the previous embodiments and may have an internal air bag as bag 52 if required. Instead of being disposed at the top of the passageway through the torus, the fan means 30 in the embodiment of Fig. 6 is positioned at the bottom of the passageway and draws air downwardly through the passageway. At the top of passageway 24 is a member 102 having the general shape of an inverted cone with a concave profile and a flat base. The member is arranged so that its base is disposed generally in the same plane as the top surface of the torus for minimzing drag as the vehicle moves through the air. The member is located by guy wires 104 extending between it and the envelope 22 and is positioned with its concave surfaces spaced from the opposing surfaces of the envelope 22 so that the shape of passageway 24 is in effect defined between the envelope and the member 102. As seen in horizontal section, the passageway has an annular shape, the diameter of which gradually increases towards the top of the torus, where the passageway flares outwardly and merges smoothly with the top surface of the envelope. Member 102 is arranged so that the width of the annulus decreases somewhat towards the top surface of the torus generally in the regions indicated by arrows 106 in Fig. 6, to achieve a venturi effect causing the velocity of the air entering the passageway 24 to be accelerated. Thus, the air being drawn into the passageway by the fan means 30 is drawn over the convex profile generally denoted 108 at the top of the torus and is accelerated, creating a low pressure area above surface 108 which tends to augment the lifting forces being imposed on the envelope.In other words, a wing effect is created, increasing the lifting forces acting on the vehicle. Means may be provided for tilting member 102 to change the shape of passageway 24 , to control the stability and or pitch of the vehicle. These means may be essentially similar to the actuators used for duct member 68 in the preceding embodiment In an alternative embodiment, member 102 may beomitted. The fan means 30 of the vehicle is supported by a gondola structure 110 which is in turn carried at the lower end of a member 112 of inverted conical shape disposed within the passageway 24 through the envelope 22t. The upper end of the cone is of greater diameter than the minimum diameter of passageway 24 when the envelope 22 is fully inflated so that the member tends to be held in the passageway by the envelope. The envelope is also secured to the member by adhesive. The envelope extends to the lower edge of member 112 and accordingly has the general shape of a pear drop in this embodiment. This arrangement has been found to distribute stresses uniformly and directly to the envelope surface and avoids the need for guy wires secured to load patches on the envelope, as is conventional in the art.In an alternative embodiment, the envelope could, in itself, be an incomplete torus shape and attached to the upper end of member 112 and the outer extremity of the gondola, for example at the points denoted A and B in Fig.6. Member 112 and the gondola would then have to be designed to, in effect, complete the torus. It is believed that this configuration would offer advantages in terms of lowering the maximum stress on the envelope because the stress would then be exerted over a larger diameter area. Gondola 110 has a central opening 114 which has substantially the same diameter as the lower end of member 112. The fan means 30 takes the form of a fan 116 disposed with its axis of rotation coincident with the axis of member 112 and passageway 114. Fan 116 is supported by a spider structure 120 that forms part of an internal space frame of the gondola.This frame is designed on conventional airframe design principles and, therefore, has not been shown in detail. The frame merely provides support for the various components of the gondola, and,for the pilots. Spider structure 120 has four arms 122 disposed generally mutually at right angles and extending outwardly through the gondola 110 from the center of opening 114. The structure is held in place by virtue of the fact that the arms 122 extend through the walls of the gondola as shown at the lefthand side of the gondola in Fig. 6.It will be understood that the gondola is shown partly sectioned in that view about a section line 124 the portion of the drawing to the right of the section line shows the external appearance of the gondola including part of one of the propulsion units 100 while the portion of the drawing to the left of the center line shows the gondola structure in section. This latter portion of the view clearly indicates the fact that the gondola includes an inner wall 110a which defines the opening 114, and an outer wall 110b which extends upwardly and outwardly from the lower end of the inner wall 110a. The arms 122 of spider structure 120 extend through openings in both of those walls. If necessary, the arms may be retained by suitable retaining means not shown . The space between the two walls 110a and 110b of the gondola may be used to house control equipment, fuel tanks, power supplies, etc., or even for carrying passengers in larger vehicles. For the sake of illustration, windows have been shown at 125 but, of course, need not necessarily be present. The gondola structure and member 112 are made as bonded matrix fiber structures as discussed previously in connection with the preceding embodiment. Each of the propulsion units 100 is mounted at the outer end of one of the spider structure arms 122. Fig. 7 is a vertical sectional view through a typical one of those propulsion units. The unit includes a housing 126 sur rounding a reversible electric motor 128 supported by struts 130 from the housing 126. The motor has a drive shaft which projects from both ends of the motor housing and the shaft is fitted at each end with a propellor. The two propellors are denoted respectively 132 and 134 in Fig. 7 and are positioned at 900 with respect to one another. The blades of the propellors are designed to produce equal thrust in whichever direction the motor turns. Reversible electric motors may not be suitable for large size vehicles. Alternatives are gas or jet engines with reversible transmission systems or arrangements using two engines. Another possibility would be to use a ducted air system vectored thrust . A still further possibility is to use a non reversible motor or engine with a variable pitch propeller capable of being controlled to provide thrust selectively in forward or reverse directions. Fig. 4 shows the relative orientations of the four propulsion units 100. It will be seen that the units are spaced mutually at 900 from one another about the vertical center line of the vehicle and are oriented so that the thrust vector of each unit is generally tangential to a notional circle drawn on that center line and passing through all four units. It has been found that this orientation of propulsion units coupled with the feature of reversibility discussed above allows for substantial maneuverability of the vehicle in flight. In an alternative embodiment, three propulsion units equally spaced around the gondola could be used. Again, suitable control equipment will have to be provided for the propulsion units but will be essentially conventional and, for that reason, has not been shown in detail. In summary, a vehicle of the form described above derives lift forces both from the gas within the torus shaped envelope of the vehicle and from the lift fan or fans which provide readily controllable vectored thrust for varying the altitude of the vehicle. Independent control of all directions of lateral movement including left, right and yaw is also provided. In addition, the embodiment ofFigs. 5 to 7 provides additional lift by virtue of the wing effect of air flowing over the top surface of the torus. It has been found in experiments that the resulting vehicle is stable and controllable and capable of lifting useful, significant payloads. By way of example, it is envisaged that a vehicle in accordance with the invention may be constructed with an envelope diameter of 140 feet and an envelope height of 55 feet, an operating altitude of 4,000 feet and a maximum forward air speed of 40 m.p.h. These dimensions of course given by way of example only and may vary in practice. The vehicle could also be built to a relatively small scale for use as a toy. Reference will now be made to Figs. 8 to 12 in describing a further embodiment of the invention. The air vehicle shown in these views is generally similar to the vehicle shown in Figs. 4 to 7 but incorporates additional improvements. Double primed reference numerals are used inFigs. 8 to 12 to denote parts corresponding with parts shown in previous views. Referring first to Figs. 8 and 9, the vehicle has an envelope 22 attached to a rigid cone member 112 from which is suspended a gondola 110 . A spider structure 120 carried by the gondola has four radial arms 122 that project outwardly from the gondola and carry propulsion units 100 at their outer ends. A vertical lift fan 116 is carried by the spider structure 120 for directing air downwardly through a central passageway 24 through the torus shaped envelope. In contrast with the previous embodiment see particularly Fig. 6 there is no member 102 of inverted conical shape within passageway 24 . Otherwise, the principal components of the vehicle thus far described are essentially similar to the preceding embodiment and are made of similar materials. In contrast to the preceding embodiment, the envelope 22 incorporates an internal hoop 140 that defines the maximum diameter of the torus. The envelope is attached to hoop 140 at spaced positions around the hoop by conventional attachment means not shown . Hoop 140 is dimensioned with respect to the envelope 22 to define a leading edge or nose in the cross sectional shape of the torus as generally indicated at 142 in Fig. 9. As seen in Fig 8, this leading edge of course extends around the entire periphery of the envelope. The envelope has a crosssectional shape resembling a flattened ellipse which is somewhat pointed at the leading edge 142. This shape streamlines the envelope for lateral movement of the vehicle through the air, reducing drag. Some lift may also be generated due to air flow over the convex surface above the leading edge 142.In this embodiment, the overall sape of the envelope may be termed a torroidal ellipsoid . Hoop 140 additionally serves to permit attachment of other components to the envelope. These include four vertical thrusters two of which are visible in Fig. 9 and are individually denoted 144. As can best been seen in Fig.8, there are in fact four such thrusters 144 equally spaced around the perimeter of the vehicle. The arrow denoted F inFig. 8 indicates the direction of forward motion of the vehicle. One of the thrusters 144 is disposed at the forward end of the vehicle with respect to this intended direction of movement while the other three thrusters are equally spaced at the rear and two opposite sides. The lateral propulsion units 100 are correspondingly positioned accordingly, the four arms 122 of the spider structure l20t by which these units are carried are disposed at right angles to one another on what might be termed as a fore and aftN axis and a lateral 1 axis of the craft as best seen in Fig. 11. The two axes are denoted respectively as X and Y .Following conventional aerodynamics terminology a vertical axis at right angles to axes X and Y on the centerline of the vehicle would be denoted Z seeFig. 9 . Two of the arms 122 that are disposed mutually at right angles incorporate devices known as 11inclinometers11. Inclinometers are conventional level sensing devices and are available from Sperry Corporation. Other conventional angle detecting means such as gyroscopes could alternatively be used. In any event, in Fig. 11, the two inclinometers are denoted by reference numeral 146 and one of those inclinometers is also visible in Fig. 9. Each inclinometer responds to changes in the inclination of the arm 122 by which it is carried. The particular inclinometers used in this embodiment provide outputs in terms of millivolts per degree of inclination. Those outputs are electronically processed by conventional means and used to control the thrusters 144 externally of the envelope. The particular inclinometers used have a very fast response are extremely sensitive so that the thrusters 144 respond almost instantaneously to signals from the inclinometers. Each inclinometer 146 in effect senses the inclination of the vehicle along the particular axis X or Y on which the inclinometer is disposed. In principle, the inclinometer on axis X controls the thrusters 144 at the front and rear of the craft while the other inclinometer controls the lateral thrusters. The signals from the inclinometers are processed so that the thrusters tend to maintain the craft in a stable attitude along both axes. The thrusters 144 and the inclinometers 146 and associated signal processing equipment combine to provide what is referred to as a damping system for the vehicle in the sense that the thrusters 144 will resist forces tending to cause the vehicle to swing about the X or Zy axis. In practice, when the craft is in horizontal motion, the thrust generated by the propulsion units 100 is below the center of drag of the vehicle and causes the vehicle to tend to incline upwardly at its leading end to some extent. The damping system then maintains that stable attitude and does not attempt to force the vehicle back to a horizontal attitude. This occurs because the damping system is designed to respond to changes in inclination of the craft ratherthan to absolute deviation from the horizontal.In flight, the damping thrusters could be used to control the pitch of the vehicle about axis Us . In this particular embodiment, each of the thrusters 144 comprises a fan 148 that is rotatable about a vertical axis and driven by an electric motor 150. The motor is supported by a strut 152 that extends outwardly from the envelope and is cpnnecte d through the envelope to the hoop 140. A housing 154 also extends outwardly from the hoop and around the fan. It should be noted that the damping thrusters need not be positioned on axes extending fore and aft and from side to side of the vehicle. For example, in an alternative embodiment, the thrusters could be 450 offset from those axes. Also, more than four or as few as three damping thrusters could be used. A further improvement in the vehicle of Figs. 8 to 12 as compared with the preceding embodiment is that a single drive motor is provided for driving both the vertical lift fan 116 and the lateral propulsion units 100 . Fig. 10 is an enlarged view of the gondola 110 of the vehicle and shows this single drive motor at 156. In practice, drive motor 156 may take the form of a gasoline engine running at constant speed. Motor 156 is mounted within the gondola 110 at the rear side thereof as contrasted with the direction of forward motion indicated at F in Fig. 10. In a manned vehicle, a cockpit will provided for one or more pilots at the front of the vehicle, generally in the area denoted 158 to counterbalance the weight of the drive motor 156. In an unmanned vehicle, appropriate control equipment can provide this counterbalancing effect. Drive motor 156 has an output shaft 160 that extends radially inwardly through the inner wall of the gondola to a gearbox 162 disposed on the vertical centerline C of the vehicle below the fan 116 .Gearbox 162 has five output shafts. Four shafts extend laterally from the gearbox through the respective arms 122 of the spider structure to the lateral propulsion units 100 . Three of those shafts are visible in Fig. 10 and are individually denoted by reference 164. At their outer ends, the shafts 164 drive the propulsion units 110 through suitable conventional rightangle drive couplings. The fifth output shaft of gearbox 162 is not specifically shown but extends vertically upwardly from gearbox 162 and carries the fan 116 . Suitable conventional servomotor controls will be provided for the fan 116 and each of the propulsion unit propellors to permit pitch changes in accordance with the thrust required to be generated by the particular fan or propellor. These controls have not been illustrated. since they are conventional. Provision will also of course be made to change the normal constant speed of the drive motor 156 to accomodate extraordinary thrust requirements. An additional improvement in the air vehicle ofFigs. 9 to 12 as compared with the preceding embodiment is incorporation of a trim control system. As best shown inFig. 12, the system essentially comprises two ballast tanks 166 and 168 disposed respectively at the front and rear of the vehicle and connected by piping 170 incorporating a pump 172. Pump 172 is operated to pump liquid between the two tanks in accordance with trim requirements. Any suitable liquid can be used in the trim control system, preferably water with suitable additives if necessary to lower the freezing point of the water. Figs. 9 and 11 show the trim control system as installed in the vehicle. The two tanks 166 and 168 are disposed within envelope 22 and are coupled to the hoop 140. The piping 170 is routed through the envelope and around the vertical air passageway 24 , where the pump 172 is located. Pump 172 will of course be integrated into the overall control system for the vehicle so that it can be remotely operated either by the pilots in the case of a manned vehicle or from the ground where remote control is used. In summary, the vehicle shown in Figs. 8 to 12 incorporates several improvements as compared with the preceding embodiment, namely the improved torus shape, the damping system for maintaining a stable attitude, a single drive motor for vehicle thrust and lateral propulsion, and a trim control system. An important practical feature of the vehicle common to all embodiments is that the vehicle does not rely on aerodynamic control surfaces to maintain stability or attitude. In other words, there is no need for the vehicle to have forward velocity to have control. In both of the embodiments described with reference to Figs. 4 to 12, the vehicle is inherently stable because the center of mass is below the center of lift. The vehicle also provides for independent control of motion in the directions of the X , Y and Z axes as well as turning motion about the Z axis yaw . In the embodiment of Figs. 8 to 12, the damping thrusters prevent turning about the X and Y axes. It should of course be understood that the preceding description relates to particular preferred embodiments of the invention only and that many modifications are possible within the broad scope of the invention. For example, the specific materials referred to previously are given by way of example only and are not to be considered as limiting. In the illustrated embodiments, the envelope of the vehicle is formed of a urethane impregnatedDACRON TM material conventionally used in airships, although there is of course no limitation to this particular material within the broad scope of the invention, the envelope could even be rigid. Obviously, variations may also be made in the manner in which the load is suspended from the vehicle while suspension on the centerline of the vehicle is to be preferred, the load could be suspended in other ways, for example from the saddle in the case of the first embodiment or from peripheral points on the gondola in the second embodiment. In the embodiment of Figs. 1, 2 and 3, the arrangement for controlling the attitude of the vehicle could be changed so that the outer duct member 66 would be displaceable with respect to the inner duct member 68 instead of the reverse arrangement shown. The engines and motors used in the vehicle need not be of the types specifically described above. For example, the engines 36 and 38 in the first embodiment need not be jet engines. The gondola in the embodiments of Figs. 4 to 12 need not be of annular form. An elongate gondola e.g. cigar shaped may be preferred for smaller craft where minimum drag is important. A vertical passageway may be provided through this type of gondola also, for accommodating a vertical lift thruster. The term torus as used herein is to be interpreted broadly. For example, the term includes shapes such as those shown in Fig. 6 and those which result in a section through the torus having an elliptical or flattened elliptical shape. In the latter case the torus would have a shape similar to that of a flying saucer . The torus shape shown in Figs. 8 and 9 the leading edge shape could be achieved other than by means of a hoop within envelope 22 for example, cables or webs could be used to hold the envelope in the required shape. The shape need not be circular in plan and could, overall, resemble a conventional airship shape but with a vertical passageway for the lift thruster. Broadly, the envelope may in fact have any shape not necessarily torroidal . For example, an envelope having the shape of a delta wing could be employed.
