# INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR ERROR PROCESSING, AND ERROR PROCESSING METHOD.

## Abstract
A data processing system for error processing and an error processing method, which system includes a main memory M , an information processing unit A , an error processing unit EP and an alternate memory. When an error arises in a portion of the main memory, corrected information is stored in the alternate memory. Then, under the control of the error processing unit EP , the alternate memory is employed instead of the malfunctioning portion of the main memory. The alternate memory is adapted to be used only when the error is a fixed error or a burst error, in order to avoid a system shut down caused by fixed and soft errors or burst and soft errors which occur during information processing. The alternate memory, therefore, is not used in a case where the error is a soft error. This imparts an additional advantage in that the size of the memory is reduced.
