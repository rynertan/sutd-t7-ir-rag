# Machine for packaging products in heat shrinkable film.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a machine 10 for packaging products in heat shrinkable film, of the so called bundling machine type, in which the film 65 fed from opposing reels 67 and 68 is made to pass over a product support platform 17 which is lowered into a vertically extending chamber 13 comprising at its top an aperture 16 which can be closed alternately by said support platform 17 and by a lateral panel 18 which is mobile horizontally when said platform 17 is in its lowered position. Within said chamber 13 there are positioned film welding means 51 and 52 and means 19 and 20 for heating the film when wrapped and welded about the product 66 in order to cause its heat shrinkage. Furth ermore, in a position corresponding with said aperture 16 of the chamber 13 , means 80 are provided for lifting the film into a position above said support platform 17 when this latter has been raised in order to close the chamber 13 and carries the finished package 102 .
