# Vascular grafts with cross weave patterns.

## Abstract
Graft prostheses are woven with cross weave patterns 35 to prevent unravelling and to increase suture hold strength. A vascular graft according to the invention is woven as a continuous tube by shuttling a continuous weft thread 30 through a double layer array of warp threads 32 . As the weft thread 30 is shuttled through the warp pat tern, groups of warp threads 32a are retained in parallel relationship to each other while interspersed pairs of warp threads 32b, c are crossed over each other. This results in graft having normal weave patterns circumferentially alter nating with weave patterns.
