# Thermal magnetic circuit breaker.

## Abstract
A circuit breaker of the type in which a toggle is manually erected to drive a heart as a unit for closing the circuit breaker. The heart includes a contact arm 12 , an actuator 14 , and overcurrent releasable latch means 16 which collectively form a normally latched unit. Under excess current conditions, the latch means 16 releases the actuator 14 , and the contact arm 12 then opens the circuit. The latch means 16 includes a con ventional bimetal strip 32 fixed at one end to the contact arm 12 . The bimetal strip 32 carries a pivoted latch lever 52 , and is surrounded by a core and armature unit 38, 44 adjacent its secured end, for operating the latch lever 52 in response to high overcurrents. High magnetic trip sensitivity is achieved in a construction wherein the whole electromagnet 38, 44 moves bodily with the con tact arm 12 , without resort to a current carrying coil for the electromagnet.
