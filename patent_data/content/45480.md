# Timing layers for color diffusion transfer assemblages.

## Abstract
Photographic assemblage comprising a combination of two timing layers and a neutralizing layer. The outermost timing layer contains photographic addenda, such as a development inhibitor, for substantially terminating de velopment of the silver halide. The timing layer next to the neutralizing layer has a much longer breakdown time so that it is permeated by the alkaline processing composition only after silver halide development has been substantially terminated.
