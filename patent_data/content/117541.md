# Apparatus for plasma treatment of resin material.

## Abstract
An apparatus for plasma treatment, capable of plasma treating works of resin material by irradiating the surfaces of the works with a microwave discharge plasma within a vacuum reaction chamber. A plasma introducing port is formed in the wall of the reaction chamber. A plasma irra diating pipe is connected to the plasma introducing port for injecting the plasma into the reaction chamber to irradiate the surfaces of the works. A discharge port is formed in the wall of the reaction chamber to reduce the internal pressure of the reaction chamber. A plasma diffuser includes a rotat able vane for diffusing the flow of plasma to distribute uni form density of plasma in the reaction chamber. A plurality of deflecting plates projecting from the inner wall of the reaction chamber toward the interior thereof may also be provided to diffuse the flow of plasma in the reaction chamber. In a method, a plurality of the works are rotated in relation to each other about a common axis, and also indi vidual works are rotated independently from each other about their own axes.
