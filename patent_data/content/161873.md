# Electronic inclination gauge with acceleration compensation.

## Abstract
Apparatus for providing dynamic measurements of the grade of a road bed provides correction for accelerations of the carrying vehicle. A tilt transducer 36 , responsive to both the angle and sense of inclination and to accelerations of the vehi cle is used to measure the angle of displacement. The time rate of change of velocity signal derived from the motion of the vehi cle is used to provide a signal corresponding to the vehicular ac celeration. The acceleration signal level is adjusted to cancel acceleration sensed by the transducer 36 , thereby providing an output reflecting the true angular grade reading.
