## Description
INSULATING MULTIPLE CONDUCTOR CABLESDESCRIPTION This invention relates to a method of insulating multiconductor, medium voltage electrical power cables at locations where the cable insulation has been removed, and, in particular, to insulating a joint between such cables and to the resulting joint. Medium voltage is used herein to specify voltages in the range of about 1 to about 36 kilovolts kV . It has long been known to insulate a joint between multi conductor cables with a cured resin system. TypicalAC multi conductor cables contain three conductors at the same voltage but in different phases. Conventionally, a joint between such cables is enclosed by a metal or plastic joint box. Resin is poured through vents in the box and allowed to cure. The cured resin insulates the conductors from each other and from the joint box. To prevent the conductors of the cable from contacting each other, a solid separator can be placed between the conductors. It has been found that the resin, which is typically at an elevated temperature when it is poured into the joint box, tends to solidify when it touches the cold conductors. This can result in voids between the conductors and between the conductors and spacer, if one is used.This method of insulating joints is cumbersome and time consuming. Another method of insulating joints is to use a heat shrinkable enclosure such as that disclosed in U.S. PatentNo. 4,383,131. This technique has been used with single core cables and with multi conductor cable. When used with multi conductor cables, each of the conductors of the cable is generally separately insulated and shielded. A heat shrinkable enclosure is then installed over the joint.Enclosing and insulating a joint by this method requires numerous steps to install the various insulating and shielding components. This invention relates to a method of using a heatshrinkable enclosure to provide insulation between the conductors of insulate a joint between multi conductor, medium voltage power cables, which method provides the advantages of a resin filled system without the inconvenience and other disadvantages typically associated with such systems, while maintaining the advantages of ease of installation of heat shrinkable systems without requiring individual insulation and shielding of each conductor.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to insulating the conductors, or cores, of multi conductor, medium voltage power cables at locations, such as joints between such cables, where the original cable insulation has been removed. The term conductor has been used in the specification and claims to refer to the current carrying element and can be the bare conductor or the conductor surrounded by primary insulation.The conductor plus primary insulation is generally referred to in the art as a core. Medium voltage A.C. power cables typically have three conductors but cable configurations containing additional conductors are known. By the term medium voltage power cables is meant electrical cables which conduct electricity at voltages between about 1 kV and 36 kV. Such voltages are also referred to as distribution voltages. This invention is described in detail below for a joint between 11 kV belted cables. It is to be understood that the techniques of this invention can be employed with other types of multi conductor power cables wherever restoration of the insulation between the conductors is desired. 11 kV belted cables are well known and generally contain three conductors each surrounded by oil impregnated cable insulation with paper or jute filler surrounding the insulated conductors. A layer of belt insulation surrounds the wormings and a metallic sheath, e.g. of aluminum or lead, surrounds the belt layer. Armor wires, or other armoring, may be provided on the outside of the metallic sheath. A protective jute or polymeric jacket is on the outside of the armor wire, if present, or the metallic sheath where there is no armor wiring. In preparing a joint between such cables, the conductors are exposed by removing the outer layers of the cable structure and the oil impregnated paper insulation surrounding each conductor. The conductors are generally of a highly conductive metal such as copper or aluminum. The conductors can be solid and can be circular, oval or sec tored. Alternatively, the conductors can be made up of numerous metals strands forming what is known as stranded conductors. The conductors of the cables to be joined are connected together by a suitable connector.Typical connectors comprise a metal cylinder which are crimped down onto and or soldered to the conductors. A preferred connector is that described in European PatentApplication publication No. 125042A US Patent Serial no. 598,557, filed April 9, 1984 , the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Each conductor of the first multi conductor cable is connected to a conductor of a second multi conductor cable. Before installing the insulation assembly of this invention, the individual conductors and connectors may be provided with initial insulation by wrapping an insulating tape or placing an insulating sleeve around the exposed portion and an adjacent insulated portion of each conductor and the connector. This may be done using several individual sleeves, e.g. one sleeve over the connector and separate sleeves over the adjacent conductor regions. In a preferred method, each exposed conductor portion and adjacent core section is insulated with a recovered dimensionally recoverable, preferably heat shrinkable, polymeric sleeve. The polymeric sleeve is preferably of an oil resistant material, for example polyvinylidene fluoride, when the cables being jointed are oilimpregnated paper insulated cables. The term recoverable article is used herein to mean an article the dimensional configuration of which may be made substantially to change when subjected to some treatment. Heat recoverable articles, which recover when heated, are particularly preferred in the practice of this invention.Usually these articles recover, towards an original shape from which they have previously been deformed but the term recoverable , as used herein, also includes an article which adopts a new configuration, even if it has not been previously deformed. In their most common form, such articles comprise a heat shrinkable sleeve made from a polymeric material exhibiting the property of elastic or plastic memory as described, for example, in U.S. Patents 2,027,962, 3,086,242 and 3,597,372. As is made clear in, for example, U.S.Patent 2,027,962, the original dimensionally heat stable form may be a transient form in a continuous process in which, for example, an extruded tube is expanded, while hot, to a dimensionally heat unstable form but, in other applications, a preformed dimensionally heat stable article is deformed to a dimensionally heat unstable form in a separate stage. In the production of heat recoverable articles, the polymeric material may be cross linked at any stage in the production of the article that will enhance the desired dimensional recoverability. One manner of producing a heat recoverable article comprises shaping the polymeric material into the desired heat stable form, subsequently cross linking the polymeric material, heating the article to a temperature above the crystalline melting point or, for amorphous materials the softening point, as the case may be, of the polymer, deforming the article and cooling the article while in the deformed state so that the deformed state of the article is retained. In use, since the deformed state of the article is heat unstable, application of heat will cause the article to assume its original heatstable shape. In other articles, as described, for example, inBritish Patent 1,440,524, an elastomeric member such as an inner tubular member is held in a stretched state by a second member, such as an outer tubular member, which, upon heating weakens and thus allows the elastomeric member to recover. Articles which are dimensionally recoverable without the application of heat are described in U.S. PatentsNos. 4,070,746, 4,179,320 and 4,338,970. Such articles comprise an elastomeric member held in a stretched state by a retaining member. The elastomeric member is retained in the stretched state until released from the retaining member by application of solvent or by mechanically breaking or removing the retaining member. Typically, such articles comprise an elastomeric tube held in a stretched state by an outer tubular member to which it is adhered. Each connector is preferably insulated with a polymeric insulating layer. Again, the insulating layer can be tape or a recovered dimensionally recoverable polymeric sleeve.Preferably a stress grading material is placed around the conductor prior to recovering the sleeve. The term stress grading material is used herein to mean a material which when applied to areas of high electrical stress, relieves or reduces the stress. The stress grading material preferably is a mastic or other polymeric material having an impedance in the range of about I X to 109 ohm cm to about 5 X 109 ohm cm, measured at 40 80 Hertz. The material can be applied over each connector in the form of a maleable filling compound, tape, sheet or the like. A preferred material that can be used is an epihalohydrin based composition such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No.4,378,463 to Senior et al the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Following initial preparation of the conductors in the above or similar manner, the joint is insulated in accordance with the method of this invention. An insert is positioned between the conductors. The insert is shaped such that it lies between each of the conductors. Generally, for a three conductor cable, the insert is in the shape of fly . At least the surface of the insert comprises a first voidfilling material which is capable of forming a void free interface between the insert and each of the conductors.Preferably, the insert should be sufficiently flexible to enable it to accommodate the configuration of the conductors in the cable. The insert should be of a material which does not melt at temperatures reached during installation of the heat recoverable sleeve or at temperatures reached during fault conditions of the cable. The insert serves to insulate the conductors of the joint from each other and to prevent them from migrating toward each other. If the insert melts, the conductors may not be kept separate from each other and if they touch when the cable is operating, premature failure of the joint may occur. The insert may be made from a material, such as a polymeric gel, as described below, capable of forming a voidfree interface with each conductor. In a preferred embodiment the insert comprises a material which itself is not a void filling material but is coated with a first voidfilling material. Preferably the insert is formed of a polymeric insulating material having a dielectric constant in the range of between about 2 to about 6, preferably about 2.5 to about 3.2. For example, the insert may be formed of a polymeric gel or a polymeric material. A polymeric insert can be formed by conventional methods, such as extrusion, molding and the like. The insert can contain a metal layer, preferably embedded in the body of the insert, to electrically shield the conductors from one another. The first void filling material, which may be insulating or stress grading, is formed of a sealant such as a mastic or gel. A mastic is an adherent, cohesive sealing material capable of filling a gap between two components. A mastic can deform or yield plastically, that is, undergo viscous flow, both during application and in subsequent service at ambient temperatures. Mastics may consist of mixtures of substantially non crystalline materials, for example, bituminous materials, elastomers, or thermoplastic polymers, and may contain insert fibrous or powdered fillers. The term gel , as used herein, refers to a swollen cross linked polymeric material, for example, a matrix of cross linked rubber containing oil. A preferred gel for use herein is that described in U.S.Application Serial No. 646,555, filedAugust 31, 1984, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the void filler is a thermoplastic material having a viscosity at 700C of between about 1 X 103 to about 5 1 X 105 poise. On application of heat to recover a heat recoverable sleeve placed over the joint, the void filling material melts and flows filling voids between the conductors and the insert. The void filler can be applied to the insert by any convenient technique, for example as a maleable putty like material, as a tape, or the like. A second void filling material can, and preferably is, applied around the conductors after the insert is positioned. This additional void filler can be applied by any convenient technique. One method of applying the voidfiller is to use it in the form of a tape and wrap one or more layers over the assembly of conductors plus insert.The second void filler can be a sealant, grease, mastic or gel and can be the same or different than the first voidfilling material discussed above. Another technique is to provide the second void filler in the form of diamond shaped profiles of a material which flows under heat and or pressure. Each profile is positioned over the gap to adjacent conductors and extending between them. On installation of the recoverable sleeve over the assembly the pressure of the sleeve and or heat, if applied to recover the sleeve, causes the void filling material to flow around the conductors filling all voids. Additional stress control material such as that described above, is advantageously applied in areas subject to electrical stress. A dimensionally recoverable polymeric sleeve, which may be in the form of a tube or sheet capable of being formed and held in the shape of a tube, is installed over the assembly after the insert and void filling materials have been appropriately positioned. In a preferred embodiment the heat recoverable sleeve has an inner insulating layer and an outer semi conductive layer. The sleeve is positioned so that it overlaps the lead sheaths of the cables and is then recovered. The insulating and conductive layer can be applied as separate heat recoverable sleeves, if desired. The outer conductive layer is electrically connected to the lead sheaths of the cables, for example by means of a metal mesh which extends across the sheath. The invention can also be used to insulate joints between shielded power cables. In such event, the method of enclosing joints between shielded cables disclosed in U.S.Patents No. 4,383,135 to Clabburn and 4,390,745 to Boettcher can be used. An outer protective jacket enclosing the entire joint can be applied. Preferably the protective jacket is a polymeric tubular article. The tubular article also is preferably installed as a dimensionally recoverable, preferably heat recoverable, tubular article or wraparound sleeve. If the cables are armoured, armouring must be established across the joint. This can be accomplished by using a metal liner under the heat recoverable sleeve. An example of a metal liner which can be used is described in European Patent Application PublicationNo. 93617A US Patent application Serial Number 374,558 , the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A heat recoverable sleeve is then positioned over the liner and recovered. Turning now to the drawings which illustrate an embodiment of this invention, Figure 1 illustrates positioning a sealant coated insert between the conductors 2, 3 and 4 of a joint between cables 5 and 6. Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a joint insulated in accordance with this invention. Insert 1 has been positioned between conductors 2, 3 and 4.The surface of insert 1 comprises a coating, 7, of mastic. Diamond shaped profiles 8, 9 and 10 of voidfilling mastic compostion are postioned around the conductors. A heat recoverable polymeric sleeve, 11, comprising an inner layer, 12, of insulating polymeric material and an outer layer, 13, of conductive polymeric material encloses the assembly. Figure 2 illustrates the joint just prior to recovery of the sleeve. On application of heat to effect recovery of the sleeve, the void filling mastics of profiles 8, 9 and 10 and of coating 7, melt and flow filling substantially all voids between insert 1 and conductors 2, 3 and 4 and between the conductors themselves and the conductors and the recovered sleeve. Figure 3 is a longitudinal view of the completed joint.In Figure 3, each of the connectors, conductors and adjacent insulation have been covered by initial insulation by means of polymeric sleeves 20, 21 and 22. The third set of conductors is blocked from view by insert 1. The void filling material, 23, is derived from the melting of coating, 7, and profiles 8, 9 and 10 shown in Figure 2. The heat and pressure of recovery of the polymeric sleeve, 11, having caused the void filling materials to fill all spaces between the insert, conductors and polymeric sleeve. A metal braid, 24, and screen, 25, are positioned over the top of the recovered sleeve, 11, and are connected to metal sheath 26 of each of cables 5 and 6. For the sake of simpliaity one cable only is marked with reference numerals.A liner, 27, comprising elongate metal strips is positioned over the joint and connected to armor wires 28 of each cable. This provides continuity of the armoring of the cables. An outer protective jacket, 29, applied in the form of a heat recoverable sleeve is installed over the joint and onto the outer jacket 30 of each cable. The invention has been described, as noted above, primarily with regard to its use in insulating a joint between 3 phase 11 kV belted cables. The invention is not to be construed as limited to such joints and can be used to insulate joints between shielded power cables, plastic insulated power, paper insulated draining and non draining mass impregnated cables and can also be used to insulate the conductors wherever the original cable insulation has been removed, for example in preparing terminations or the like, or where the insulation has been removed by accidental damage or destruction.
