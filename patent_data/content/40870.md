# Process of treating a dust which contains zinc and lead and which is derived from an iron or steel making process.

## Abstract
Zinc and lead are separated together out of dust derived from a gas cleaning installation in iron or steel making by a flotation separation treatment. In order eco nomically to provide a good separation of these metals and to leave a residue which is re usable in an orepreparation process in the iron and steel industry, the flotation sep aration treatment is at a pH of 7 to 9 and is effective to achieve a separation, according to size of the dust particles, of a floated component in which the zinc and lead are concentrated and a non floated component which is suit able for re use.
