# LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS CHECKING SYSTEM AND TECHNIQUE

## Abstract
There is disclosed a system and technique for providing an indication of an error in the driving circuitry of a liquid crystal display. An alternating current generator is coupled to drive the backplane of an LCD display and also coupled through gating circuits to drive the individual segment electrodes in response to data which individually controls each of the segments of the LCD display. The alternating current source is provided to the backplane of the LCD through an EXCLUSIVE OR gate which has as a second input a control signal which operates to invert the sense of the backplane drive voltage in accordance with a predetermined control scheme under the control of a microprocessor. At the same time, the microprocessor programming is configured to invert data and is used to control the individual segments in a cyclic manner so that the inverted data corresponds to inversion in the backplane drive signal. As long as the driving circuit elements function in a proper manner, the simul taneous inversion of the segment drive signals and the backplane signal causes the LCD to operate in a normal fashion. However, if the internal operation of the drive circuitry fails such that the data does not change as required by the cyclic inversion process the effected segment will blink on and off indicating a malfunction in the driving circuitry.
