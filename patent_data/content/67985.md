# Ribbon drive arrangement for a printer.

## Abstract
Apparatus for advancing equal increments of ribbon to a take up rell 10 utilizes a drive blade 24 having an edge 26 that tends to slip in one longitudinal direction and grip in the other. Reciprocation of the drive blade at the circumference of the accumulated ribbon results in incremental ribbon movements in the direction corresponding to gripping of the drive edge. For a preferred implementation, the drive edge has the contour of an involute. By so contouring the drive blade, the engagement of the ribbon circumference is essentially tangential for a broad range of diameters of the accumulated ribbon.
