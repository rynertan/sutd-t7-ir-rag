## Description
SILVER HALIDE PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material, and more particularly, to a silver halide photographic material having improved image quality. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Among the many properties that are required to be met by recent versions of silver halide photographic materials, stability, high sensitivity, reduced fog and high quality image are particularly important.For X ray photographic materials that should provide much information with reduced personnel exposure toX rays, the requirements are high sensitivity, high image quality and adaptability to rapid processing. Several methods are known for increasing the sensitivity of silver halide photographic materials and they are classified into two groups. In the methods which belong to the first group, the sensitivity is increased by incorporating sensitizers in the silver halide photographic material. For example,U.S. Patents Nos. 2,521,926, 3,021,215, 3,625,697,Japanese Patent Publication No. 11116 72, and JapanesePatent Application OPI No. 155828 79 the symbol OPI as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application disclose techniques for increasing the sensitivity of the silver halide photographic material by incorporating organic thioethers in it.The essence of the methods of the second group is enhancement of the degree of development by increasing the size of silver halide grains or by incorporating sensitizers or development accelerators in developing solutions. Methods are also known for rapidly processing silver halide photographic materials by either reducing the amount of gelatin as binder with respect to the silver halide or effecting development at an elevated temperature 30 400C in a developing bath of high pH value. However, the conventional methods for increasing the sensitivity of silver halide photographic materials or achieving their rapid processing are known to provide photographic images of much inferior quality.Many reports have been made on the method for minimizing the deterioration of the quality of the photographic images formed on silver halide photographic materials. According to one method, an antifoggant or stabilizer is incorporated in a silver halide emulsion in order to inhibit the deterioration of image quality due to the coarsening of developed silver grains. Other methods are essentially the same in that they reinforce the film, on which developed silver grains are supported, by hardening the gelatin binder in the photographic material. Hardeners used for this purpose include inorganic compounds such as chrome alum aldehyde compounds such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde compounds having activated halogens as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,288,755 compounds having reactive ethylenically unsaturated bonds as described in U.S.Patent No. 3,635,718 epoxy compounds as described in U.S. Patent No.3,091,537 and organic compounds such as halogenated carboxyaldehydes e.g. mucochloric acid . These hardeners are incorporated in silver halide emulsion layers or protective layers to harden the gelatin binder to such a degree that it withstands processing under severe conditions such as rapidity and elevated temperatures. However, none of these methods are capable of improving the image quality satisfactorily without impairing the other properties of the silver halide photographic materials e.g.sensitivity, contrast and maximum density . Therefore, it has long been desired to provide a technique for producing a high quality image on silver halide photographic materials in spite of the use of a sensitizer in silver halide emulsions, reduction in the amount of gelatin binder with respect to silver halide, or rapid development under elevated temperature. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One object of the present invention is to provide a silver halide photographic material that produces an image of good quality even if it is processed to achieve high sensitivity subjected to rapid processing using less gelatin with respect to the silver halide. Another object of the present invention is to provide a silver halide photographic material that yields an image of good quality even if it is subjected to rapid processing under high pHs and temperatures. As a result of various studies to develop a product that can attain these objects, we have found that they can be achieved by a silver halide photographic material that has formed on a support at least one photographic constitution layer containing at least one compound of the following formula EMI4.1 wherein A is a carbonyl group or a sulfonyl group R1 is an aliphatic group, an aromatic group or a heterocyclic group R2 and R3 are each a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an alkyl group, SO3M whereinM is a monovalent cation , a halogen atom or C0OR4 wherein R4 is a monovalent cation or an aliphatic or aromatic group , provided that at least one of R2 and R3 is COOR4 and n is an integer of 0 to 6. Simply stated, we have found that the objects of the present invention can be accomplished by incorporating the thioether compound of the formula in at least one element in a silver halide photographic material. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The thioether compound incorporated in a photographic element according to the present invention is represented by the formula given hereinabove. Preferred aliphatic groups for Rl and R4 are straight chain, branched chain and cyclic aliphatic groups such as alkyl groups having 1 to 18 carbon atoms e.g. methyl, nbutyl, 1 propyl, t butyl and n dodecyl , alkenyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms e.g. allyl, butenyl and octenyl , and cycloalkyl groups having 3 to 8 carbon atoms e.g. cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl .

Preferred aromatic groups for R1 and R4 include phenyl and naphthyl groups, and they may have at least one substituent such as an alkyl group e.g. methyl or ethyl , alkoxy group e.g. methoxy or ethoxy , hydroxyl group, halogen atom e.g. chlorine, bromine or iodine , acylamino group e.g. acetylamino or benzoylamino , alkoxycarbonyl group e.g. methoxycarbonyl or ethoxycarbonyl , succinimido group, carbamoyl group or nitro group Preferred heterocyclic groups for R1 are 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic groups having at least one hetero atom selected from among nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur atoms e.g. pyrrolyl, pyridinyl, pyridyl, thiazolyl, morpholino and furanyl . These heterocyclic groups may have at least one substituent selected from among those listed as substituents for the above defined aliphatic and aromatic groups. Preferred monovalent cations for M in the group SO3M for R2 and R3, as well as for R4 include hydrogen ion, alkali metal ion e.g. sodium or potassium ion and ammonium ion. Particularly preferred compounds having the formula defined above are those wherein R1 is an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, either R2 or R3 is a carboxyl group and the other is COOR4 R4 is an aliphatic or aromatic group , and A is a carbonyl group. Typical examples of the compound having the formula noted above are listed below, but it should be understood that they are merely illustrative and the scope of the present invention is by means limited to these examples.EMI7.1 EMI8.1 EMI9.1 EMI10.1 EMI11.1 EMI12.1 These compounds may be synthesized by the methods described in Chemical Abstracts, vol. 35, pp. 2114, 1941 and Journal of the Chemical Society, pp. 21232125, 1951. The compounds according to the present invention are effective not only in increasing the sensitivity but also in inhibiting fog and minimizing the deterioration of image quality, and in this respect, the compounds are advantageous over conventional organic thioether compounds that can increase the photographic sensitivity only at the expense of other photographic characteristics. The silver halide photographic material comprising a support having formed thereon a photographic element that contains the compound of the formula is hereunder described in detail.

The silver halide photographic material of the present invention may be used for processing by blackand white or color photography. It may be used for general purposes, as well as for special purposes such as printing, X ray photography and radiography.Especially good results are achieved if it is used as a high sensitivity, silver iodobromide photographic material. The silver halide photographic material of the present invention may be subjected to ordinary exposure or it may be exposed for a shorter period or only for a flash of time. The material may be processed photographically by a conventional method. The two basic processing steps are development and fixing, which may be effected consecutively or simultaneously. The present invention is hereunder described in greater detail by reference to examples which are given here for illustrative purposes only and are by no means intended to limit its scope. Example 1 One kilogram of a silver halide photographic emulsion containing 100 g of silver iodobromide containing 3.0 mol silver iodide and 40 g of gelatin was subjected to sulfur sensitization and gold sensitization to prepare a high sensitivity negative emulsion. Saponin was added to this emulsion as a coating aid. The resulting emulsion was divided into 15 portions. The compounds indicated in Table 1 were added to 14 portions in the amounts also indicated in Table 1. The resulting coating solutions were applied to polyethylene terephthalate film bases. To each of the resulting silver halide emulsion layers, a gelatin solution containing a coating aid and a hardener was applied to form a protective layer in a thickness of 1.5 g m2.After drying, each sample was exposed to white light with a sensitometer,Model KS l of Konishiroku Photo Industry Co., Ltd., according to the method specified in JIS, and subsequently processed with a processor of continuous transport type which could accomplish development, fixing, washing and drying automatically. The developing solution used had the following composition.Developing solution development period 30 seconds at 350C Anhydrous sodium sulfite 70 gHydroquinone 10 gBoric anhydride lg Sodium carbonate monohydrate 20 g l Phenyl l,3 pyrazolidone 0.35 g Sodium hydroxide 5 g 5 Hethylbenzotriazole 0.05 gPotassium bromide 5 gGlutaraldehyde bisulfite 15 gGlacial acetic acid 8 g ,Water to make 1,000 ml The so processed samples were subjected to sensitometry to check for their photographic characteristics, which are summarized in Table 1, wherein the figures in the column of sensitivity are relative values, with the sensitivity of the control sample No.1 taken as 100. The quality of the image formed on each sample was evaluated by visually checking the deterioration of developed silver grains at a density of 0.8, and the indices of rating were 0 good , n moderate , and X unacceptable . The combination of two indices means that the degree of deterioration was of a value between the two indices. Table 1 demonstrates the ability of the compounds of the formula to provide an image of improved quality without sacrificing other photographic characteristics.
