# Method and apparatus for controlling air fuel ratio in internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
In an internal combustion engine wherein feedback control of the air fuel ratio is carried out in accordance with the concentra tion of a specific composition in the exhaust gas, so that the air fuel ratio is close to an aimed air fuel ratio, the atmospheric pressure is detected, and the aimed air fuel ratio is varied in accordance with the detected atmospheric pressure.
