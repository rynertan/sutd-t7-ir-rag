# A process for the production of a surface coated article.

## Abstract
A surface coated article or part, for example, hard material coated steels or cemented carbides for cutting tools, wear resisting tools, sliding parts or decoration articles, having good properties comparable to those obtained by the PVD method, can be produced by a plasma CVD method characterized by using jointly a high frequency source and a direct current source as a plasma exciting source, holding a substrate or base metal at a negative potential by the direct current source and adjusting a high frequency power density applied to a plasma forming space to 0.01 to 1 W cmÂ³, an absolute value of a direct current voltage to at most 1500 V and a gaseous atmosphere pressure to 0.05 to 5 Torr.
