# Method of manufacturing a copolymer of trioxane.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing copolymers of trioxane by copolymerizing trioxane in the presence of a cation active catalyst, and wherein one or more sterically hindered phenols are incorporated into a monomer or monomers e.g. into the trioxane monomer prior to the polymerization in an amount of from 0.001 to 2.0 by weight based on the total amount of monomers, the polymerization reaction being subsequently carried out in the presence of said sterically hindered phenols characterized in that the polymer product is heated to a temperature above its melting point to selectively decompose constituents of the copolymeric product which are relatively unstable, leaving a polymeric trioxane product of enhanced stability.
