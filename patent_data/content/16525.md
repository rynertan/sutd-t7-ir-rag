# Thermostatic electrical switch and method of assembling such a switch.

## Abstract
A thermostatic electrical switch for providing an electri cally conductive path when the temperature of the switch is below a threshold temperature and for opening the path when the temperature of the switch is above the threshold tempera ture, includes a bimetallic thermostatic element 14 which is riveted to a support post 20 . The latter is welded to a base plate 10 which forms a portion of the switch casing. An indentation 44 is formed in the casing such that a portion 42 of the mounting 36 for an electrically conductive terminal 30 is urged downwardly, thus positioning the terminal 30 for proper switch operation.
