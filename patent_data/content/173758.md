## Description
FLOATING DISK BRAKE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a floating disk brake suitable for braking a two wheeled vehicle. In general, two types of disk brakes are available for two wheeled vehicles. In one of these types, a floating caliper is supported by a fixing member which is mounted on a member of the vehicle body such as a front fork. In the other type of disk brake, a torque receiving part is formed integrally with the front fork, and the caliper is slid in the axial direction of the disk rotor as the pads wear. The former type of disk brake is disadvantageous in that, as the disk brake requires the fixing member, it is relatively heavy. Also, since the fixing member is disposed between the caliper and the front fork, the center of gravity of the caliper is offset from the fork center, and hence its inertial moment relative to the fork is large, which lowers the handling characteristics of the brakes. The latter disk brake type, although superior to the above described disk brake in performance, suffers from the difficulty that the torque receiving part lying over the disk rotor must be formed on the front fork so as to extend therefrom. Thus, the structure of the front fork is intricate and the manufacturing cost thereof is high. Furthermore, in the other type of disk brake, it is difficult to make the right and left pads of the same configuration. Therefore, because the pads cannot be interchanged, they are more expensive. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a floating disk brake of small weight and low manufacturing cost and in which the caliper slides stably and the center of gravity of the caliper is close to the front fork or the like. In order to achieve the foregoing object, in the floating disk brake according to the invention, a brake force applied to the pads is first received by the caliper and then transmitted to the vehicle body through two slide bolts serving also as caliper mounting bolts. At least one of the bolts extends over the disk rotor in such a manner that the slide center thereof is substantially coincident with the center of the disk rotor. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figs. 1, 2 and 3 are a front view, a left side view, and a bottom view showing an example of a disk brake according to the invention and Fig. 4 is a sectional view showing slide parts of a caliper. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS. A preferred embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In Figs. 1 through 3, reference numeral 1 designates a caliper which includes, as one unit, a cylinder part 2, a bridge part, an outer pawl 4 and slide parts 5 and 5 into which slide bolts described later are inserted. A liquid pressure operated piston not shown is mounted in the cylinder part. The bridge part of the caliper has a pin 6 at the center. The pin 6 is laid parallel to the axis of rotation of a disk rotor d and passes through apertures in protrusions which extend from the peripheries of the backing plates of a pair of pads 7 which are disposed on both sides of the disk rotor.That is, the pin 6 prevents the pads 7 from coming off the caliper. As shown in Fig. 2, torque receiving surfaces 8, 8 and 9, 9 are formed in the caliper on both sides corresponding to the inner and the outer sides of the disk rotor and are abutted against the side surfaces of respective ones of the pads 7. Specifically, the surfaces 8 and 9 receive the brake torque which is applied to the pads when the vehicle moves forwardly and the surfaces 8 and 9 receive the brake torque which is applied to the pads when the vehicle moves backwardly. Of the slide parts of the caliper, the slide part 5 positioned on the outer side of the rotor D is adjacent the periphery of the rotor, and the other slide part 5t positioned on the inner side of the rotor D is provided Dn one side of the rotor and extends in the axial direction of the rotor D. As shown in Fig. 4, a slide bolt 10, which receives the main portion of the torque, is fitted into the hole of the slide part 5 so that the slide part 5 is slidable with respect to the caliper, and another slide bolt 10 , which receives the remaining part of the corque, is fitted into the hole of the slide part 5 in the same manner. The above described slide bolts 10 and 10 serve also for mounting the caliper on the vehicle. The bolts 10 and 10 are screwed into mounting parts a and a formed on a member A of the vehicle body such as the front fork.One end portion of the bolt 10 inserted into the slide part 5 extends over the rotor in such a manner that the center of the effective slide length of the bolt coincides with the center of the thickness of the rotor. The slide bolt 10 is preferably a stepped bolt. However, in the case where it is a straight bolt as shown in Fig. 4, a sleeve 11 should be placed over the bolt so as to provide a sufficiently tight fit. In this connection, the slide part 5 may be shifted radially of the rotor so that the bolt 10 extends over the rotor.However, it should be noted that, in this case, it is necessary to greatly protrude the mounting part a of the member of the vehicle body. Accordingly, it is preferable that the slide part and the pin be designed as shown inFig. 4. In the figures, references numerals 12 and 12 designate dust boots. In the disk brake thus constructed, the brake torque which acts on the pads 7 is received by the torque receiving surfaces 8 and 9 or 8 and 9 and transmitted to the caliper. The brake torque thus transmitted is received by the two slide bolts which are fixedly secured to the vehicle body. As described above, in the disk brake according to the invention, the two slide bolts serve also as the mounting bolts of the caliper, and a brake force applied to the pads is transmitted through the caliper to these bolts. No fixing member as used in the conventional floating disk brake is needed. Accordingly, the disk brake of the invention is smaller in weight and lower in manufacturing cost than the conventional floating disk brake The mounting parts formed on the member of the vehicle body are simple in configuration. The member can be readily manufactured at low cost. In the inventive disk brake, the center of the effective slide length of at least one of the slide bolts is substantielly coincident with the center of the thickness of the rotor, and therefore the caliper will not be twisted during braking. Accordingly, the caliper operates smoothly to permit a stable braking operation.In addition, decreases of the brake force due to inadequate contact of the pads is eliminated, and nonuniform wear of the lining members reduced. Furthermore, since the disk brake has no fixing member, the center of gravity of the caliper may be set close to the front fork, for instance, so that the inertial moment relative to the front fork is decreased, whereby the handling characteristics are improved.
