## Description
TOILET AND DENTAL PREPARATIONS AND THEIR USE FOR ORAL AND DENTAL HYGIENE The field to which this invention relates is that of oral and dental hygiene, and of toilet and dental preparations for such hygiene purposes. T11 particular the invention relates to oral products such as dentifrices and mouthssashes which have antiplaque activity, i.e. those which are effective in retarding the formation of oral plaque in the mouths of users. There are already numerous prior art disclosures relating to substances with anti plaque activity.Among these are disclosures of the use of aliphatic amines, e.g. decylamine, dodecylamine, tetradecylamine and hexa decylamine, as showing such activity in tests carried out in vitro. Tetradecylamine was studied separately by R.M. eying, J. Dental Res. 1951 , 30, 399 402, in trials using tetradecylamine in medicinal paraffin. US Patent No. 3,943,267 Randol discloses use of heavy metals in treatment of tooth enamel by a process including acid etching and heavy metal deposition on the e eled surfaces the metals used include zinc, iron, cromiun, nickel, lead, cobalt, cadmium, copper, platinum, L, and silver and the process requires conversion to metal sulphides in vivo to resist decay. There are also disclosures of certain metal compounds as ingredients in such oral products as dentifrices and meuthashes 7 e.g. zinc ions US Patent No. 4,022,880 Vinson Cancro and UK Patent No. 1,373,001 Unilever S Patent No. 3,888,976 Mlkvy and Tucci . We consider it desirable to find ways of increasing the activities of active ingredients present in anti plaque oral hygiene compositions, so that for a given effect less of the active ingredients is required. This invention is based on the finding that the anti plaque activity of oral products containing tetra ylamine can be enhanced by the presence of compounds of certain metals to an extent greater than that attributable to the mere presence of the metal compounds themselves i.e. the effect is what has been called synergistic. A sImilar effect was sought, but not found, in mixtures in which dodecylamine or hexadecylamine was present instead the tetradecylamine as an anti plaque agent. Accordingly, by this invention, there is provided an oral composition, such as a dentifrice or a mouthwash, comprising a tetradecylamine, b at least one compound of zinc, aluminium, copper, iron, nickel, cobalt and or tin, and c a base acceptable for oral use and compatible with components a and b in which composition the tetradecylamine component a and metal compound component b are present in amounts effective for retarding plaque formation and for providing a retarding effect greater than that attributable to the sum of the plaque retarding effects which ould be shown by each of components a and b in the absence of the other The oral compositions of this invention can take the form of mouthwashes, toothpastes, tooth powders, lozenges, dental creams and or chewing gum.They enable plaque to be controlled when they are applied to the mouths of users, and are hence useful in the prophylaxis of tooth decay and periodontal disease. The concentration of the tetradecylamine component a in the compositions will preferably, for many purposes, be chosen within the range 0.005 0.05 molar. The concentration of metal compound component b in the compositions will preferably, for many purposes, be chosen within the rangeO.0005 molar to 0.05 molar.However, for many purposes it will be preferable that where zinc or aluminium is used, the concentration chosen w.ill preferably be in the range 0.001 0.05 molar there copper, nickel, iron, cobalt or tin is used, the concentration chosen will preferably be in the range 0.0005 0.015 molar.A plurality of compounds of one or a plurality of metals as .specified at b can be present, if desired. According to the Seventh Issue of the Merck Index, aluminium and zinc have an LD50 orally in rats of approximately 3 4 g kg body eight copper, iron, nickel, cobalt have LD50 orally in rats in the range 0.3 0.9 g kg body weight, and tin has an LD50 orally in rats in the range about 0.05 g kg bod eight. The synergism observed between the active ingredients a and b in the compositions of this invention has the result that plaque may be controlled with relative ease by using substantially non tosic amounts of the metal compound with a substantially non toxic amine. The essence of the invention consists, thus, of a synergistic combination with greater antiplaque activity than the simple additive effect of both of the constituent compounds. Tetradecylamine when used alone exhibits good antiplaque activity but when coupled with the metal compound component b of this invention, gives significant additional activity. In addition to their synergistic activity, the metals wsere chosen for their solubility, low astringency and low toxicity. imbile not wishing to be bound by the following theories, it is postulated first that the amine facilitates the penetratlon of the bacterial cell wall by the germi civil metal. Charged metals are normally excluded from inside microorganisms by a lipid protein cell wall. The iipophylic tetradecylamine may solubilise the cell wall or as the charge of the metal to allow passage of the particle into the bacterial cell. An increased death of tneroorganisms will be manifested in a reduction of plaque gswth and its accumulation.Several antibiotics, including the sulfa drugs,have been shown to work synergistically with metals While antibacterial agents alone will kill or retard the growth of plaque bacteria, neither the metal ions nor the tetradecylamine of this invention can easily be used at levels permissible in the oral cavity which produce the technical effect possible with the to in combination. Additionally, as a second postulate, the level of antiplaque activity may be increased because the synergistic combination reduces the surface energy and surface tension of the tooth pellicle. The pellicle may be covered by a low surface tension monolayer of tetradecylamine and positively charged metal ions. In effect, this lover surface tension may reduce the affinity of plaque to the dentition. Further, this monolayer may reduce the incidence of caries by preventing the transport of ions from the enamel surface. The latter theory, regarding lowering of surface tension, is favoured since the antiplaque compositions of the instant invention failed to demonstrate synergistic germicidal activity in bacterial cultures. In addition, the critical micellar concentration CMC of tetradecylamine was found to be lowered in combination with selected metals. Bass, Dillingham and Powers J. Dent. Res. 54 968 971, 1975 shoved that lowering the CMC in a series of aliphatic amines increased the antiplaque activity. The CMC of other amines was not lowered in combination ith zinc. It was found that lo cjering the CMC paralleled the finding of synergistic plaque reduction of the present invention. Aluminium and or zinc metals are thought to lover the CMC of tetradecylamine by forming ion pairs.This theory was further confirmed hen it vas found that the addition of C02 to tetradecylamine increased antiplaque activity while lowering the CMC. The final evidence was offered when it was found that during formulation, if nonionic detergents such as Brij, Tween or Triton products ere employed, the CMC of tetradecylamine in combination with selected metals was raised to that concentration expected for tetradecylamine alone, while the synergistic plaque reductions were lost, leaving plaque reductions indicative of only tetradecylamine. Dodecylamine, dimethyldodecylamine, hexadecylamine, decylamine, and N,N dimethyl octadecylamine do not give synergistic plaque reductions. Only the primary aliphatic amine with a fourteen carton chain length acted synergistically with zinc or aluminium. Under the conditions of the tests described below, the minimum amount of the metal compound or mixtures of compounds necessary to result in control of plaque is generally about 0.001 molar for aluminium and zinc, and O.QQOd molar for copper, nickel, iron, cobalt and tin,at the site of formation of the plaque. While there seems to be no maximum effective concentration, an amount significantly higher than about 0.05 molar aluminium and zinc, and 0.015 molar copper, nickel, iron, cobalt and tin, may be difficult to formulate in an organoleptically acceptable mouthwash. The particularly preferred metal concentration molar is about 0.018 aluminium, 0.020 for zinc, 0.0037 iron, 0.0042 nickel, 0.0042 cobalt, 0.0041 copper, and 0.0019 tin in combination with tetradecylamine in a mouthrinse for application to plaque.The maximum concentration which can be utilised is properly determined by product parameters such as astringency and formulation eompatibilities. The preferred pH of a mouthrinse is in the range pH 3 5, particularly preferred is about pH 4.1 C aluminium, pE 4.3 for zinc, pH 5 for copper, iron, n elwel and cobalt, and pll 3 for tin, to deliver sufficient tl ions to the site of plaque formation. The concentration of metal containing compound combined ith a vehicle and the tetradecylamine to form the compositions of this invention is not critical and may vary thin an organoleptically and toxicologically acceptable limit so long as the amount of compound is sufficient to result in the concentration of 0.0005 to 0.05 molar at the site of formation of the plaque, preferably 0.01 0.05 molar in the case of aluminium and zinc, and 0.0005 0.015 molar n the case of copper, iron, nickel, cobalt, and tin. The optimum abount of the tetradecylamine necessary Xa result in a control of plaque when combined with the metals of the instant invention is generally about 0.005 molar in a rinse. While there is no maximum effective concentration, amounts significantly higher than about 0.05 molar will be difficult to formulate in an organoleptically and toxicologically acceptable mouthwash or manner. The maximum concentration of tetradecylamine which can be utilised is thus properly determined by product parameters as listed above in relation to the maximum amount of metal which can be use. Without tetradecylamine the high level of the metal which would be necessary to observe significant benefit may be too astringent and or toxic for normal therapeutic use. Furthermore, high levels of plaque reduction with a metal have never been demonstrated in a clinical study.In addition, high levels of metals are difficult to formulate into a product acceptable to the consumer and conformable with legislation applicable to oral products. Tetradecylamine without a metal does not attain the desired plaque reductions. While higher levels of this amine confer additional benefit, its bitter taste, greater tonicity, prohZems of solubility and compatibility with the vehicle provide practical limits of increasing its concentration. This invention sugests the use of the highest possible level of tetradecylamine which is non toxic and suitable for formulation. The addition of the metal to the amine does not markedly affect the toxicity or acceptability of the amine. By using the synergistic mixtures of this invent on advantage is taken not only of their co action, but also of the fact that low levels of each can be employed. In one embodiment, the invention comprises a wateralcohol soluble tetradecylamine metal mouthwash oral rinse which reduces dental plaque. In a further embodiment, the combination of the invention may be used in a dentifrice. The essential components of the invention are an orally acceptable medium, which may be for example, water and alcohol, and the antiplaque mixture. The term orally acceptable medium applies to any suitable carrier medium for the antiplaque mixture such a medium is selected to be harmless to the oral cavity and is not meant to be intentionally swallowed however the medium is, of course, harmless in an amount accidentally ingested during use. Ibe compositions of the instant invention may be utilised with a variety of orally compatible agents such as mouthwashes, toothpastes, dentifrices, tooth powders, lozenges, and chewing gum as well as any compatible vehicle for applying the synergistic combination at the specific site of plaque formation. Such formulations are generally prepared in accordance with the art recognised practice. In mouthwash formulations, for example, the medium includes typically an essentially aqueous solution of alcohol, glycerine or sorbitol. In some mouthwash formulations it is not essential to use any of these materials although theS do help to solubilise certain flavour oils. A suitable mouthrinse, for example, stains about 0.02 molar tetradecylamine and about 0.02 molar zinc or aluminium, or 0.004 molar copper, iron, cobalt, ickel, or 0.002 tin, in a medium consisting essentially of 95 water and 5 250 ethanol. Other common additives do not affect synergism may also be present. In toothpastes and tooth powder formulations, the essential ingredient other than tetradecylamine and the aluminium and or zinc compound of this invention is any itable dental abrasive compatible with components a and oj the composition. It is recommended that the Lrasives used in the dentifrice formulation of the presentInvention provide a final composition which has an accept Dle dentin abrasion value. Suitable dental abrasive Instances include finely divided particles of appropriate size, hardness and composition for dentifrice abrasives. Toothpastes and tooth powder formulations also commonly contain a soap or synthetic surface active agent. It is essential in these formulations as well as mouthwash oi mulations to provide sufficient foaming action to satisfy market eonsumer preference for this property. A preferred aterial for dentifrices is sodium lauryl sulfate. oxever,many other surface active agents can be used so long s bhey are compatible, i.e. they do not interfere with the activity of the compound synergistic interaction between the etradecylamine and the metal compound. It has however been noted that in some compositions nonionic detergents did inactivate the synèrgism. The practitioner in the art will be able to test for this effect by the methods referred to herein and avoid such inactivation. In addition, the toothpaste formulation will frequently contain humectants sufficient to provide smooth texture and flowability. Glycerine and sorbitol are preferred for tis purpose together with suitable amounts of water, ethyl alcohol, glucose, and mannitol. Lastly, the toothpaste formulation generally contains cected binding agents. These also should be compatible itfl the synergistic combination as well as with the other toothpaste components. For example, cellulose ethers are ole type of preferred binder. A chewing gum medium normally comprises a gum base and cemmon flavouring materials used in the field. The flavouring materials are present at a level of about 0.01 2.0up of the final chewing gum composition. The base is a chewable plastic gum material such as natural rubber, chickle, polyvinyl acetate, ester gum, coumarone resin, and paraffin wax. The gum base is typically nade from a mixture of two or more plastic gum materials to achieve a preferred degree of plasticity for chewing. Optionally, a binder or a softener may be used as well as sweetening agents. Lozenges may be made containing the synergistic combination with a suitable binder. The invention is further illustrated hereinbelow by a number of Tests and Examples. An in vitro test was used in the Tests described herein for examining and effects of chemotherapeutic agents on plaque, and was carried out in accordance with the test reported in the Journal of Dental Research, Vol. 55,February 196, page B286, by R T Evans, P J Baker,R A Coburn and R J Genco. An assay system for producin artificial plaque was used to screen antiplaque agents rapidly under conditions which simulated those found in the oral cavity. Evans et al. found that effective dosages in the in vitro assay correlated with results of previously published clinical studies. The assay gives reproducible, quantitative results and has the ability to distinguish between antibacterial agents which are clinically effective or non effective as plaquae inhibitors. The in vitro plaque was formed at 370C on uniformlysized aluminium plummets which were first coated with saliva. The plummets were then placed in a growth medium inoculated with clinical plaque samples. After seven hours the plummets were suspended overnight in a 25 ó saliva mixture. On the second day, the plummets were aaersed in a 50 saliva 50 o test compound mixture for ne minute, placed in the growth medium for seven hours, retreated with the test mixture and suspended in 25eah aliva overnight. The plummets were treated again on the third day and incubated in the growth medium for three hours.The plaques were removed from the plummets by sonication into approximately six millilitres of buffer and quantitated by optical density O.D. in a Beckman DU spectrophotometer at 570 nm. A test compound showed antiplaque activity if the O.D. plaque mass was reduced from the control plaques treated earth water. Positive controls were included to determine relative activity. Comparisons of antiplaque activity were then made within a given experiment. At least five replicas per compound were examined. The following Tests and Examples will more fully illustrate the embodiments of this invention. All parts and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise noted. TEST 1 The effects of H20, 0.04 cetyl pyridinium chloride CPC , 0.0600Zh tetradecylamine TDA 0.30 ZnC12 and several concentrations of zinc salt plus tetradecylamine are examined, by the artificial plaque method previously described, all with 15 ethanol, at pH 4.1.

Clinical data suggest however that zinc salt alone provides about 5 reduction in plaque. Tetradecylamine alone was slightly less effective than the quaternary ammonium germicide, CPC. This level of TDA is usable in an oral product for human use without creating anp problems due to toxicity. The results shown in Table I clearly show that the combination of ZnC12 and tetradecylamine produced a greater anti plaque effect than the sum of the effects produced by either ingredient alone, i.e. a synergistic effect. The dose response curve of tetradecylamine indicates the necessity of increasing the concentration from 0.060 ó to 0.2to in order to raise the plaque reduction from 18 to 44 when a metal is not present. This higher level would be expected to be more toxic and more bitter than lower levels. The synergistic effect of combining the use of zinc chloride with that of tetradecylamine, as disclosed herein, allows such drawbacks to be mitigated. TEST 2 To test higher levels of tetradecylainine, the artificial plaque treatment previously described is eliminated on the third day to simulate infrequent use of the antiplaque products.

When compared with zinc salt and tetradecylamine, equimolar amounts of aluminium salt and tetradecylamine give statistically greater reductions.In addition, aluminium salt is less astringent and may be less toxic, thus, aluminium salt plus tetradecylamine may be more useful in a therapeutic product. It is postulated that the weight gains observed with the metal salts alone are the result of the precipitation of salivary components onto the plummots. Even without regarding these as weight gains, both metal salt combinations with the amine give wide margins of synergistic reductions over the relatively low reduction seen for the tetradecylamine alone. Cations such as hydrogen, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium, have not been found to give synergistic plaque reductions by the in vitro assay. In addition, synergism has not been found associated with chloride, fluoride, nitrate, phosphate and sulphate in themselves.

The antiplaque effect of the formulations is greater than that accountable by the sum of the effects of either tetradecylamine or metal salts alone.

TEST 4 The effects of 0.060 0 tetradecylamine TDA 0.05 Sus14, and the combination of SnC14 and TDA at these concentrations are examined by the artificial plaque method previously described, all with 15coo ethanol, at pH 2.6.

Clinical data suggest that tin salt alone provides slight reductions in plaque. As with Tests 1 3, it is postulated that the weight gains observed with the metals alone are the result of the preciptation of salivary components onto the plummets.Even IgnorIng these weight gains, the metal amine combina tins gave wide margins of synergistic reductions over the relative low reduction seen for the tetradecylamine alone. Cations such as hydrogen, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, did not give synergistic plaque reductions by the in vitro assay. In addition, synergism was not found associated with chloride, fluoride, nitrate, phosphate and sulphate in themselves. The combination of SnC14 and tetradecylamine clearly produced a synergistic effect. The dose response of tetradecylamine indicates the necessity of increasing the concentration from 0.0605b to 0.20 in order to raise the plaque reduction from 1850 to 4450 when tin is not present. This higher level would be expected to be more toxic and more bitter than lower levels.

The antiplaque effect of the formulations is greater than that accountable by the sum of the effects of either tetradecylamine or metal salts alone. In summar, it appears that the presence of quantities of salts of the metals mentioned above which are in themselves insufficient to give more than a very small antiplaque effect or which give none at all can nevertheless result in a substantial increase in the anti plaque effectiveness of tetradecylamine present in an oral product.
