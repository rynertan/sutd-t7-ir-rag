# Gas panel system with interrogation by selective sustain.

## Abstract
Readout from a gas panel system is achieved by modi fying the sustain drive circuitry, which normally applies a full sustain voltage to all cells simultaneously, so that only a partial sustain voltage is applied, and using address cir cuitry, also used e.g. for writing, to address one or more selected cells so that only those selected cells have the partial sustain voltage boosted to the full sustain voltage and go through a selective sustain cycle, different cells being selected during different cycles to provide sequential readout. During a sustain cycle a cell will ignite twice whose walls had been previously charged to represent data. Cell ignition is detected photoelectrically by detectors each com mon to a number of cells to provide readout.
