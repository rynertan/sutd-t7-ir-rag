# SYSTEM FOR MAINTAINING PRESSURE IN AN INJECTION MOLDING MACHINE.

## Abstract
A system for maintaining pressure in an injection molding machine, in which an injection shaft is driven by an electric motor 20 which is controlled by a numerical control unit 30 . To maintain the pressure, the numerical control unrt 30 operates the electric motor 20 while applying torque limit thereto, so that a predetermined pressure is applied to the molten material in the metal mold 4 .
