# Hose and method of making same.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a flexible hose for a vacuum cleaner comprises injection moulding a length of hose 13 in the annular space 12 between a mandrel 11 and a mould body 10 , withdrawing the mandrel 11 axially. opening the mould 10 and moving the mandrel 11 and moulded length of hose 13 axially until the mandrel 11 is back to the moulding position, closing the mould 10 and repeating the process until the required continuous length of hose 13 is produced. The mandrel 11 and mould body 10 have corresponding screw thread formations 14, 15 so that a corrugated hose 13 is produced, and electrical conducting wires 17 are laid into an axial rib formed on the hose 13 .

## Description
NOSE AND THOD OF I AKIr G SA tE This invention relates to hoses and to methods of manufacturing the same, and in particu ar to flexible hoses such as are used with suction cleaning equipment and the like.It is known to manufacture such hoses by the extrusion of an appropriate section of a plastics material, winding the section spirally and welding the spirally wound section with plastics material. Such a hose is entirely of plastics material and may have reinforcing ribs incorporated therein dependent upon the section shape extruded. Alternatively it is known to produce hoses of a plastics material reinforced with a wire spirally wound on a mandrel. It is also known to mould into such hoses an electrically conducting wire or wires. However such processes involve several steps includin spiral winding of either the plastics section or the ire reinforcing and in consequence the hoses produced are relatively costly.Also if such electrically cor.uctlnt wires are helically wound an excessive quantity of wire is used which adds to the cost of the hose.It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a hose which avoids the abovementioned disadvantages.The invention provides a method of manufacturing a flexible hose comprising the steps of injection moulding a length of hose in an annular space between a mould body and a mould portion of a mandrel located in a moulding position within said mould, moving said mandrel axially thereof to a position in which only an end of said mould portion remains within said mould body, opening said mould body and moving said mandrel together with said moulded length of hose until said mandrel is in said moulding position, closing the mould and repeating the aforementioned steps until a desired continuous length of hose is produced.The method may also include the step of laying a length of one or lengths of a plurality of continuous wires in said mould prior to each injection moulding step, whereby said wire or wires is or are moulded into said hose in a continuous length or lengths.Preferably said mandrel is formed having a helical rib on the outer surface of said mould portion in which case said withdrawing step comprises unscrewing said mandrel from the moulded hose. Preferably said mould body is also formed with a helical rib on its inner surface, the helical rib in said mould body being of the same pitch as that in said mandrel but axially displaced therefrom by an amount equal to half of said pitch when said mandrel is located in said moulding position. Said mould body may also be provided with an axially aligned groove in its inner surface wherein said wire or wires may be laid, whereby an axially aligned rib is moulded onto said hose with said wire or wires embedded therein.The invention will now be described further by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Figs. 1 to 4 illustrate in section one embodiment of apparatus for use in the method of the invention in four consecutive steps of the method.Referring now to Fig. 1 there is shown a mould body 10 and a mandrel 11 located in a moulding position concentrically within the body 10 so as to provide an annular space 12 therebetween. A thermoplastic material is injection moulded into the annular space 12 to form a length of hose 13. The mandrel 11 is formed having a helical rib 14 extending along a moulding portion on its outer surface and the mould body 10 is formed having a helical rib 15 on its inner surface. The ribs 14, 15 are of equal pitch but are displaced axially by an amount equal to half of that pitch when the mandrel 11 is located in the moulding position so that the hose 13 is helically ribbed but of constant wall thickness.When the length of hose 13 is formed the mandrel 11 is screwed relative thereto until it reaches the position shown in Fig. 2. In this position only a short length of helical rit 14 remains within the hose 13 and mould body 10. The mould body 10 is then opened and the mandrel 11 is moved back to the moulding position as shown in Fig. 3. The mandrel 11 is not rotated during this movement so that the hose 13 remains supported by the mandrel 11 and stationary relative thereto. When the mandrel 11 is in the moulding position the hose 13 extends beyond the mould body 10 which is then closed to form the annular space 12 around the mandrel. A further length of hose 13a is then injectionmoulded in the annular space 12 as shown in Fig. 4, hose lengths 13, 13a becoming integral.By successively repeating the steps described above a continuous hose may be produced of any desired length.As shown in Fig. 3 an axially aligned groove 16 is provided in the mould body 10. Along this groove one or more electrically conducting wires 17 are laid so as to be moulded into a longitudinally extending rib not shown on the hose 13. Since the hose 13 does not rotate relative to the mould body 10 only a length of wire or wires 17 equal to the length of the hose 13 is required, successive potions of wire 17 being pulled from a supply thereof not shown into the groove 16 by the movement of the mandrel 11 and hose 13 from the position of Fig. 2 to that of Fig. 3. The helical ribs 14, 15 are shown as being of rectangular form but alternative forms of rib may be provided if preferred.Also the electrically conducting wires 17 may be of round section as is conventional or may be flattened so as to be enclosable in a shallower rib on the hose.In this case the hose would possess greater flexibility than would be achieved in the case of round wires.Alternatively, or in addition to the electrically conducting wires 17, a tube may be laid so as to be moulded into a longitudinally extending rib in the manner previously described. Such tube may then be used for the subsequent housing of the electrically conducting wires 17 or for the feeding of fluid such as detergent to a carpet cleaning device, or air to a pneumatically operated switching device, mounted on the head of the suction cleaning device.
