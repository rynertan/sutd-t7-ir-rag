# Method and means for detecting the location of a marine pipeline or a cable.

## Abstract
To detect the location of a marine pipeline or a cable 1 by mens of a vessel 4 , acoustic pulses are transmitted by a submarine pulse transmitter 9 carried by the vessel 4 . These pulses, as well as the reflections of the pulses on the seabottom 2 and on the pipeline or cable 1 are detected by means of two detectors 8A, 8B that are carried by two para vans 5 towed by the vessel 4 . The signals received by the detectors 8A, 8B are combined and the record of the com bined signals is displayed. The signal parts that are represen tative for the acoustic waves reflected by the pipeline 1 are identified in the record by separate colours or various inten sities of a single colour.
