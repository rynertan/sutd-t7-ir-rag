# A process for electrochemical additions to alkenes.

## Abstract
Organic compounds having vicinal functional groups, such as amidothioethers and esterthioethers, are prepared by electrochemically oxidizing an organic disulphide, an organic diselenide, a hexasubstituted organic disilane or a tretrasubstituted organic hydrazine in the presence of an alkene and an organic nucleophile.
