# POLYSILICON DIODES

## Abstract
An improved lateral polysilicon diode in an integrated circuit structure is disclosed. The diode is characterized by low reverse current leakage, a breakdown voltage of at least 5 volts, a low series resistance permitting high current flow before being limited by saturation. The polysilicon diode comprises a polysilicon substrate having a first zone suffi ciently doped to provide a first semiconductor type and a second zone sufficiently doped to provide a second semicon ductor type whereby the junction between the two zones forms a diode. The lateral edges of the diode are treated to remove defects to thereby inhibit current leakage around the edges of the lateral diode to lower the reverse current leakage of the diode.
