# A rotary type electrostatic spray painting device.

## Abstract
A rotary type electrostatic spray painting device compris ing a rotary shaft 8 and a spray head 9 fixed onto the front end of the rotary shaft. An annular step portion 73 radially extending outwardly from the tip edge of the cup shaped inner wall 15 of the spray head, is formed on the tip of the spray head. A thin annular tip wall 74 axially projects from the outer periphery of the annular step portion. Paint is fed onto the cup shaped inner wall of the spray head. The rotary shaft is supported by a single thrust air bearing 40 and a pair of radical air bearings 22 23 . An electrode 66 continuously contacting the rear end of the rotary shaft, is provided. A negative high voltage is applied to the housing 2 3 of the paint device. In addition, the negative high voltage is also applied to the spray head via the electrode 66 and the rotary shaft 8 .
