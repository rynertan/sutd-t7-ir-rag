# Rotary variable delivery compressor.

## Abstract
A variable delivery compressor having plural compress ion chambers 32 whose volume is changed as a rotor 16 is rotated in a housing 2, 4, 6 2b, 4b, 6 to compress a gas sucked through a suction port 38 38a 120 and deliver the compressed gas through a discharge port 42 , comprising a bypass passage 66 66a 66c 148 for communication between a compressing and a sucking compression chamber 32 of the plural compression chambers a device for changing the position of the discharge side extremity of an opening of the by pass passage on the side of the compress ing compression chamber, in the circumferential direction of the rotor, to retard the compression start timing of the compressing compression chamber and at least one of a variable flow restrictor device 4, 64, 68, 73, 96 110, 111, 112 4, 64, 68a, 73, 96 4, 64, 68a, 73a, 115, 116, 117 associated with a suction passage communicating with the suction port 38 38a 120 to adjust a flow of the gas which is sucked through the suction passage, and a pressure relief device 70, 71, 73, 96 70, 71, 73a, 115, 116, 117 including a pressure relief passage 70, 71 and a switching device 73, 96 73a, 115, 116, 117 for closing and opening the pressure relief device.
