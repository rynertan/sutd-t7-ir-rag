See Scheme II. A compound of Formula III is known or can readily be prepared from compounds known in the literature. For example, compounds of Formula III wherein R³ is an amino or a substituted amino may be prepared in a manner analogous to or derived from the process described by P. C. Unangst, An alternate route to compounds of Formula III having R³ as amino or substituted amino groups may be analogous to a reaction described by M. A.

For example, esterification of a compound of Formula VIII, wherein R¹ and R² are as defined above may be followed by cyclization to obtain the compound IV. See Scheme V. The antiallergy activity of the compounds having the Formula I of the present invention was determined by the well known Schultz Dale procedure, that is described in N. Chand, et al, By virtue of this antiallergy activity the compounds of Formula I are useful in treating an allergic hypersensitivity reaction AHR having broad symptoms. For example, the symptoms may include dermatitis, lacrimation, nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty in breathing, pain, inflammation, and in severe cases, anaphylactic shock, circulatory collapse, and even death. The AHR is found in man as well as other animals suffering from bronchial asthma, seasonal pollinosis e.g., hayfever , allergic rhinitis, urticoria, allergic conjunctivitis, food allergies, and anaphylactoid reactions. In an AHR an antibody reagin in man influences the cell membrane of a mast cell by reacting with an antigen, to initiate reactions within the mast cell which ultimately causes release of mediators bioactive compounds such as bradykinin, slow reacting substance A SRS A , histamine, serotonin 5HT , possibly some prostaglandins, or other not now known substances. The mediator is released from the mast cell whereupon it attaches to suitable receptor sites e.g., on smooth muscle resulting in AHR attack symptoms. Various methods are used to relieve the symptoms of AHR. It is not known, however, what mechanism is effected for the antiallergic use by the compounds having Formula I of the present inventions. Pharmaceutical compositions are prepared from compound Formula I and salts thereof described as the present invention having inert pharmaceutical carriers. The compositions may be either solid or liquid. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill readily determines a subject who is exhibiting AHR symptoms. Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to the pharmaceutical art. The compounds can be administered in such oral unit dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, or granules. They also may be administered rectally or vaginally in such forms as suppositories or bougies they may also be introduced parenterally e.g, subcutaneously, intravenously, or intramuscularly , using forms known to the pharmaceutical art. They are also introduced directly to an affected area, e.g., in the form of eye drops or by inhalation . For the treatment of AHR induced conditions such as erythema, the compounds of the present invention may also be administered topically in the form of ointments, creams or gels. In general, the preferred route of administration is orally. An effective but nontoxic quantity of the compound is employed in treatment. The ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian will readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the anti AHR agent to prevent or arrest the progress of the condition. In so proceeding, the physician or veterinarian could employ relatively low dosages at first, subsequently increasing the dose until a maximum response is obtained. Initial dosages of the compounds of the invention having Formula I are ordinarily in the area of 10 mg up to 2 g per day orally, preferably 10 mg to 500 mg per dose orally, given from one to four times daily or as needed. When other forms of administration are employed equivalent doses are administered. The compounds of this invention can also be administered as pharmacologically acceptable salts such as can be readily prepared with inorganic and organic bases, such as NaOH, KOH, Mg OH₂ , Ca OH ₂, NH₄OH, substituted ammonium salts, L arginine, choline and N methyl glucamine. The novel compounds of Formula I are named as derivatives of indoles by virtue of a nitrogen containing heterocyclic five membered ring fused to a phenyl ring. The fused rings are numbered counterclockwise starting with the nitrogen atom at the one position as shown in the ring system of Formula I . Certain compounds within the scope of Formula I are preferred, since they have a more advantageous pharmacologic effect. Preferred compounds include compounds of Formula I wherein Q is hydrogen. Compounds of the Formula I more preferred are the following compounds 1 5 methoxy 3 1 methylethoxy 1 phenyl Of the above, the most preferred compound is 5 methoxy 3 1 methylethoxy 1 phenyl Alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, is methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, or isomeric forms therof. Alkyl of from one to twelve carbons, inclusive, is methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, etc, and includes Alkoxy of from one to twelve carbons, inclusive, is methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, etc, and includes isomeric forms of alkoxy of from one to six carbons, inclusive. Alkoxy of from one to six carbons, inclusive, are preferred. Substituted phenyl is a phenyl having at least one substiuent and particularly one or two substituents such as, alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, alkoxy of from one to four carbons, inclusive, hydroxy, nitro, amino, substituted amino, mercapto, alkylthio of from one to four carbons, methylenedioxy, or halogen. Substituted amino is mono or di alkyl amino wherein alkyl is from one to four carbons, inclusive. Halogen is fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, or trifluoromethyl. The compounds of this invention are synthesized as illustrated in Schemes I V. Generally, the compounds having the Formula I, as illustrated in Scheme I are prepared by treating an indole 2 carboxylic acid of Formula III wherein R¹, Q, R², and R³ are as defined above. A 3 alkoxy ester of Formula IX, wherein R¹, Q, and R² are as defined above, R³ is alkoxy, and R⁵ is benzyl or alkyl of from one to six, inclusive, as shown in Scheme VI may be prepared by methods analogous to those known in the literature. See for example, H. Plieninger, et al, The 3 alkoxy ester is then converted to carboxylic acids of Formula III wherein R¹, Q, and R², are as defined above, and R³ is alkoxy. The conversion is accomplished using standard conditions, such as, using either a strong base, e.g NaOH or KOH, or analogous organic bases such as potassium tertiary butoxide, followed by acidification. see a similar process in indole chemistry in the A. Galun, et al, reference cited above . Additionally, the general preparation of a compound of Formula I wherein R⁴ is A, R³ is amino or substituted amino and R¹, Q, and R² are as defined above may also be accomplished as shown in Scheme VII. That is, a mixture of a compound of Formula XX wherein R¹, Q, and R² are as defined above and an alkylaldehyde of from one to four carbons, inclusive in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile, is treated with sodium cyanoborohydride. The resulting compound of Formula XXI wherein R⁷ and R⁸ are independently hydrogen or alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, and R¹ and Q are as defined above is then reacted with R² Cl or R² Br wherein R² is as defined above to obtain the compound of Formula IX. Such a compound of Formula IX, wherein R¹, Q, R² and R⁷ and R⁸ are as defined above may be directly coupled with the compound of Formula II in the presence of lithium diisopropylamine or treated as shown in Schemes VI and further, optionally treated as for Schemes I, II or III as described above. A compound of Formula XX wherein R¹ is 5 methoxy and Q is hydrogen is known and is prepared by the procedure described in S. V. Simakov, et al, The preparation of XXI is generally conducted by the procedures known as reductive amination and the further reaction to convert the compound of Formula XXI to the compound of Formula IX₁, is analogous to the reaction having conditions known as an Ullmann reaction. Also, the compound of Formula I wherein R⁴ is A, and R³ is alkylthio or alkylsulphonyl may be prepared by the processes shown in Scheme VIII. The compounds of Formula XXX wherein R¹ and Q are as defined above are prepared by known methods, methods analogous to known methods or are commercially available and are reacted with R² Br or R²Cl wherein R² is as defined above using conditions analogous to those described as an Ullmann reaction and shown as step 2 of Scheme VIII. Then the carboxylic acid group is protected, for example, by reaction with CH₃I to form an ester of Formula XXXII wherein R¹, Q, and R² are as defined above and then treated with thionyl chloride in a reaction similar to that described by J. Szmuszkovicz, The compound of Formula XXXIII reacts with a Grignard reagent or an alkyl cuprate reagent to yield alkylsulphinyl or phenyl or substituted phenylsulphinylindoles of the Formula XXXIV wherein R⁹ is alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, phenyl or substituted phenyl. The sulphinyl indoles of Formula XXXIV may then be reduced with trifluoroacetic anhydride and sodium iodide to provide the compound of Formula IX, or further reacted to give the compound of Formula IX₃. Again the Formula IX may be coupled with 5 aminotetrazol by various procedures discussed above to give a compound of Formula I wherein R³ is SR⁹ wherein R⁹ is as defined above and R¹, Q, and R² are also as defined above. A compound of Formula I wherein R³ is SR⁹ may of course, be further treated with standard oxidizing reagents such as potassium permanganate or metachloroperbenzoic acid, using conditions analogous to those known for similar reactions to obtain a compound of Formula I⁴ wherein R⁹ is as defined above. The preparation of compounds of Formula I wherein R³ is a sulphur containing group as described hereinabove is shown in Scheme VIII. Particularly, the processes described above include compounds wherein R¹ is 5 methoxy, Q is hydrogen, and R² is phenyl or benzyl beginning with either a commercially available compound or a compound described by Y. Murakami, et al. in The 3 alkoxy carboxylic acids of Formula III may be purified by conventional methods or employed without separation in the step shown in Scheme I. This step is accomplished by methods known in the art, for example, by coupling the 3 alkoxy carboxylic acids of Formula III with 5 aminotetrazole of Formula II, in the presence of coupling agents. Such agents include 1, The starting materials required for the processes described in this invention are either commercially available or they can be synthesized by methods known in the art of organic chemistry. For example, an acid intermediate having the Formula III wherein R¹, Q, and R² are hydrogen, R³ is methoxy, is described by N. T. Modi, et al, Under certain circumstances it is necessary to protect either the N or O of intermediates in the above noted process with suitable protecting groups which are known.
