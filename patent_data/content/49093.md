# Internally vented float bowl carburetor with primer pump.

## Abstract
A manually actuable primer 45, 47 for an internally vent ed float regulated fuel bowl type carburetor 11 employs an ar rangement for minimizing variations in fuel mixture richness re sulting from variations in air intake path restrictions as might be created by a clogged air filter includes a bifurcated float bowl air vent conduit 61, 63 with one branch 61 communicat ing with the carburetor bore in the region of the Venturi 59 and the other branch 63 communicating with the bore 57 outside the region of the Venturi along with an arrangement for directing displaced fuel from the fuel supply chamber 25 di rectly into a conduit 43 which normally conveys fuel from a uel well 41 to the Venturi region 59 , the directing arrange ment being formed as an annular insert 23 for the fuel well, the aperture of which forms the fixed fuel metering orifice of the carburetor. With this arrangement primer actuation pres surizes the region above the fuel in the float bowl 25 , forcing through the annular insert 23 directly into the conduit 43 communicating between the fuel well and the carburetor bore Venturi 59 , while the bifurcated float bowl air vent arran gement allows a smaller 65 opening into the float bowl, mak ing float bowl pressurization priming feasible, while minimizing mixture richness changes normally associated with air intake obstructions such as a dirty air filter.
