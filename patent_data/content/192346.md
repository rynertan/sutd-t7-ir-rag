# Servo assisted master cylinder assemblies.

## Abstract
A servo assisted master cylinder assembly 1 for a vehicle hydraulic braking system has a tandem master cylinder 4 with primary and secondary pistons 5, 6 operative to pressurise primary and secondary pressure spaces 7, 8 for primary and secondary brake circuits. A servo chamber 11 is defined behind the primary piston 5 , and pressurisation of the servo chamber 11 from a source of pressure fluid is controlled by valve means 13 in response to an input force applied to the primary piston 5 . The valve means 13 comprises a spool 34 operated solely by pressure in the primary space 5 and a bias force from servo pressure in a bias chamber 50 and a spring 51 . The secondary piston 6 has a smaller effective area than the primary piston 5 , so that the pistons are in abutment in their retracted positions. To reduce pedal travel, one of the brakes of the primary circuit can be supplied from the servo chamber 11 instead of the primary pressure space 7 .
