# Switching regulator type power supply circuit.

## Abstract
A power supply circuit comprises a converter transformer T and a switching transistor TR1 . The input winding N1 of the transformer, the collector and emitter of the transistor TR1 , and a collector emitter current detecting resistor R11 are connected in series, while the base of the transistor TR1 is connected through a starting resistor R14 to a direct cur rent input L1 and is also connected to one end of a feedback winding N2 of the transformer T . A turning off capacitor C9 and a diode D9 are connected in series between both ends of the feedback winding N2 , whereby the capacitor C9 is charged on the occasion of non conduction of the transistor TR1 . A switching element formed by two transistors TR3, TR4 which are cascade connected is connected directly or through the above described current detecting resistor R11 between one end of the capacitor C9 and the emitter of the transistor TR1 . A variable direct current voltage obtained based on the voltage from a detecting winding N3 of the transformer T and a voltage developed across the above de scribed current detecting resistor R11 are applied to the con trol input B of the switching element TR3, TR4 , so that the switching element TR3, TR4 is rendered conductive when the voltage developed across the resistor R11 reaches a prede termined value determined by the variable direct current vol tage, whereby the transistor TR1 is turned off by the voltage across the capacitor C9 .
