## Abstract
An automatic numbering apparatus for use with a text processing system has first storage means 108 for storing a starting position specified on a display screen of a display and the kind or type of a corresponding outline number, an outline number generator 110 for sequentially generating, when the starting position of the specified item is specified on the display screen and a predetermined key is operated, outline numbers corresponding to the starting positions of the specified items, second storage means 113 for storing the outline number generated by the outline number gener ator 110 , for starting position thereof, and a corresponding page and text inputted by a data input device keyboard , and an outline searching device 117 for searching for the outline number, the corresponding position and the corresponding page of the stored contents in the second storage means 113 , whereby the text containing the items can be printed out and a table of contents comprising a list of the items and the corresponding pages as searched by the outline sear ching device can be printed out on paper. Document data formed from character data inputted by the data input device is stored in a text memory and displayed on the display device. When a mode detector detects that a numbering mode has been selected, a data processor 20 searches for previously specified outline numbers and generates a subse quent index number, the index number automatically being set on a document text specified by the text data.
