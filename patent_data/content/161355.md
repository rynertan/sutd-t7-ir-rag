# Apparatus for producing oxidized filaments.

## Abstract
An apparatus 100 for producing continuous oxidized filaments comprises an oxidizing furnace 101 having a heated oxidizing gas atmosphere 103 therein, into which continuous precursor filaments 105 such as polyacryloni trile filaments are continuously introduced and from which the oxidized filaments 107 are continuously drawn out. A first duct 205 communicates with the furnace 101 to provide thereinto a flow of an oxidizing gas such as heated air at a temperature between from about 200 C and about 300 C and a second duct 207 exhausts gas from the fur nace 101 . A conduit 209 connected to the furnace draws off a part of the gas in the furnace together with sealing air introduced into the furnace from outside. To counter any fire in the conduit 209 or the furnace 101 an injecting means 223 is located in the conduit 209 for injecting water in the form of liquid and or in the form of steam, and a shutting means 229 is provided in the conduit 209 to shut off gas flow in the conduit 209 , whilst a water spraying means 235 is provided in the furnace 101 to extinguish any fire in the furnace.
