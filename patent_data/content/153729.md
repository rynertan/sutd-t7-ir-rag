# Optical recording medium.

## Abstract
In an optical recording medium comprising a pair of substrates 11,21 each having an electrode, the space between the substrate is filled with a high dielectric liquid crystal 31 to form a rewritable recording layer. A phthalocy anine is applied to the substrate to form a radiation absorbing electrode.
