## Description
FLUORINATION PROCESS AND FLUORO ANALOGS OF HYDROCODONE AND OXYCODONE DESCRIPTIONTechnical Field This invention relates to a fluorination process for production of compounds which are useful as intermediates in syntheses of novel fluorine analogs of hydrocodone and oxycodone, the fluorine analogs exhibiting analgesic and or narcotic antagonist properties in mammals.Background Art Morphine and codeine analgesics exhibit toxic properties or have addictive action. Considerable effort has been made to find derivatives that are free from these qualities and still have analgesic effects.Compounds which are narcotic antagonists are also useful in medicine, such as in the treatment of addicts. Fluorine derivatives of codeine have been reported by Ayer in U.S. Patent 3,137,701. They are prepared by the reaction of a 6 hydroxyalkaloid having the codeine ring structure with a fluorinating agent such as N 2 chloro 1,1,2 trifluoroethyl diethylamine. One such compound obtained by Ayer, and confirmed byBognar et al., Acta Chimica Academiae ScientiarumHungaricae 67, 63 69 1971 , is of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein the double bond is at the 7,8 position, that is, beta gamma, relative to fluorine in the 6position. It is well known that fluorine substitution in organic compounds causes different biological effects and is different from chlorine, bromine or iodine substitution, as for example the 6 chloro, 7,8double bond compound disclosed by Stork et al., J. Am.Chem. Soc. 78, 4619 1956 . Diethylaminosulfur trifluoride DAST is a convenient reagent for replacing the carbonyl oxygen of aldehydes and ketones with two fluorine atoms. W. J.. Middleton, J. Org. Chem., 40, 574 1975 , NewFluorinating Reagents, Dialkylaminosulfur Fluorides and L. N. Markovskij, V. E. Pashinnik and A. V.Kirsanov, Synthesis, 787 1973 . Middleton disclosesCC13F, diglyme, methylene dichloride and benzene as reaction solvents and temperatures of 25 850C.Markovskij et al. disclose that the carbonyl compound and dialkylaminosulfur trifluoride are simply mixed in equal molar amounts and heatedDisclosure of the Invention One aspect of the invention resides in compounds of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 10 carbon atoms, allyl, methylallyl, dimethylallyl, cycloalkyl methyl of 4 7 carbon atoms, 2 furanyl methyl, 2 tetrahydrofuranylmethyl, 2 thienylmethyl, 2 thienylethyl or phenylethyl which may be ring sub stituted with chloro, bromo, fluoro, methoxy or 1 3 carbon atom alkyl substituents Y is H or R1 R1 is alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms or alkanoyl of 1 12 carbon atoms R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy or alkanoyloxy of 1 4 carbon atoms n is 1 or 2 and a is a 6,7 double bond when n is 1 and a single bond when n is 2 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds.Formula I and all formulas shown hereinafter are depicted by planar representations. One skilled in the art will readily understand the nonplanar aspects of these representations, for example, that the carbon oxygen bond in the 5 position is exo or alpha.Pharmaceutically acceptablc salts arc tliosc iladc with physiologically acceptable acids that are knoxm in the art such salts include the hydrochloride, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, citrate and maleate. The invention also resides in pharmaceutically active compositions which include these compounds. Particularly preferred are compounds of formula I wherein R is cyclopropylmethyl or cyclobutylmethyl. Those compounds wherein Y is H or acetyl are generally more active, as are those wherein R2 isH. For reasons of availability and pharmacological activity, generally, n is 1 and, therefore, a is a double bond. The compounds of Examples 5 7, 11 and 12 illustrate the best mode of the invention of whichExamples 5 and 11 are preferred. Compounds of this invention can be prepared by reacting a disubstituted aminosulfur trifluoride with a mineral acid MA , for example, HC1 or H2S04 salt of a 6 keto compound corresponding to that of formula I wherein Y is R1 R2 is H or alkanoyloxy of 1 4 carbon atoms, a is a single bond and F n is replaced by carbonyl oxygen 0 .In such process the ketone of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 10 carbon atoms, allyl, methylallyl, dimethylallyl, cycloalkylmethyl of 4 7 carbon atoms, 2 furanylmethyl, 2 tetrahydrofuranylmethyl, 2 thienylmethyl, 2 thienylethyl or phenylethyl which may be ring substituted with chloro, bromo, fluoro, methoxy or 1 3 carbon atom alkyl substi tuents R1 is alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms or alkanoyl of 1 12 carbon atoms R is hydrogen or alkanoyloxy of 1 4 carbon atoms and MA is a mineral acid, is reacted with a disubstituted aminosulfur trifluoride fluorinating agent of the formula R4 R5 NSF3 wherein each 5 R4 and R , alike or different, is a primary alkyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms or R4 and R5 when taken together are CH2 4 , CH2 5 or CH2CH2OCH2CH2 at a temperature of about 400C to about 800 C in the presence of a polar or nonpolar solvent and recovering the fluorine containing compound of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein R, R1 and R are as defined above n is 1 or 2 and a is a 6,7 double bond when n is 1 and a single bond when n is 2.In accordance with the process of the invention, many cyclic and acyclic ketones are transformed by the disubstituted aminosulfur trifluoride into vinyl fluorides as well as gem difluorides. When R in formula I is H obtained as shown in Example 13 , the corresponding 6 fluoride is converted to a pharmaceutically superior compound by alkylation of the HN group with RX, usually under basic conditions, wherein R is as previously defined except that it is not H and X is generally halogen C1, Br orI , for example,cyclopropylmethyl bromide. In the compounds obtainable by the procedures herein, the substituent in the 3 position is generally the 3 methoxy substituent. Treatment of such compounds with a demethylating agent, such as ahydrogen halide, gives the 3 hydroxy compound from which can be prepared the corresponding alkyl ether wherein the alkyl group contains 1 4 carbon atoms, for example1 the propoxy or butoxy derivative, or the corresponding ester of a C1 C12 alkanoic acid, for example, the formate, butyrate or dodecanoate, using general synthetic methods. The esters can exhibit greater potency as pharmaceuticals. The more active compounds are preferably prepared by reacting under substantially anhydrous conditions the ketone of the formulaEMI6.1 wherein R3 is alkyl of 1 9 carbon atoms, vinyl, l pro penyl, isobutenyl, cycloalkyl of 3 6 carbon atoms, 2 furanyl, 2 tetrahydrofuranyl, 2 thienyl, 2 thienylmethyl or phenylmethyl which may be ring substituted with chloro, bromo, fluoro, methoxy or 1 3 carbon atom alkyl substituents R1 is as defined above 2 R is hydrogen or alkanoyloxy of 1 4 carbon atoms and MA represents a mineral acid, with a disubstituted amino sulfur trifluoride of the formula R R NSF3 wherein each of R4 and R5, alike or different, is a primary alkyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms, or R4 andR5 taken together are CH2 4 , CH2 5 or CH2CH2OCH2CH2 ,at a temperature of about 400C to about 800C,in the presence of a polar or nonpolar solvent, and recovering the fluorine containing compound of formula described below. When the amide starting material of formulaII is used, the aforesaid fluorination step produces an intermediate compound of the formulaEMI7.1 wherein the symbols are as previously defined, which formula includesEMI7.2 This intermediate is subjected to reduction whereupon theEMI8.1 group is converted toEMI8.2 The reduction can be accomplished using conventional chemical techniques, for example, by subjecting the intermediate of formula IV to reaction with LiAlH4, as exemplified in the examples below. Other reducing agents which can be used include other alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium or potassium borohydride. When the compound of formula III is used as the starting material in the aforesaid reaction, the product will be of the formulaEMI8.3 MA wherein the symbols are as previously defined, which formula includesEMI8.4 Regarding formula I, when R2 is to be hydroxyl in the final product, the compound subjected to fluorination should have R2 as the ester or equivalent protective group which is subsequently converted to the hydroxyl. When R2 is OH in the starting compound, the use of excess fluorinating agent, disubstituted aminosulfur trifluoride, results in the formation of.a product wherein R2 is F. When the starting ketone is the mineral acid salt, for example, the hydrogen sulfate of formula III, a good yield of the desired fluorinated compound is obtained.For better yields it is preferred to use the starting ketone which is the amide of formula II. It is more preferred to use such amide wherein R3 has 3 8 carbon atoms. The disubstituted aminosulfur trifluorides are known compounds. Particularly useful are diethylaminosulfur trifluoride DAST , pyrrolidinosulfur trifluoride, morpholinosulfur trifluorde and piperidylsulfur trifluoride. The reaction is normally carried out in a solvent medium, preferably catalytically using a highly polar catalyst. The solvent can be polar or nonpolar but it must be nonreactive with the disubstituted aminosulfur trifluoride. The use of a polar solvent tends to give more of the 6 fluoro 6,7 unsaturated codeine n is 1 whereas the use of a nonpolar solvent generally gives more of the 6,6 difluoro compound n is 2 . By polar solvent is meant a solvent that has a high dielectric constant. Solvents which favor conversion of ketones to vinylene fluoridesEMI9.1 are polar and include dioxane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether glyme , diethylene glycol dimethyl ether diglyme and triethylene glycol dimethyl ether.Nonpolar solvents, such as hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons, for example, CC13F, generally increase the amount of 6,6 difluoro gem compound formed. The addition of a small amount of a strong acid, such as fuming sulfuric acid, as a highly polar catalyst increases the rate of formation of the 6,7unsaturated 6 fluoride. Other useful catalysts include strong mineral acids that, in the quantities used, do t react with the carbonyl group, with the carbon carbon blue bond or with other groups present in the codeine type c.npounds, for example, perchloric, polyphosphoric and fluorosulfonic acids. The useful acids generally have Åa log K of greater than about 2. The amount of catalyst used is generally about 0.001 to 1 by weight of the ketone starting material.The catalyst is believed to unction by increasing the polarity of the reaction tedium and by increasing the rate of the reaction. The reaction is conducted, under substantIally anhydrous conditions, in a vessel which is suitably glass, but a metal or ceramic vessel can be used. The reaction is conducted at 400C to about 800C with the range 0 300C being generally preferred. The reaction time is dependent upon the reactants and the temperature, with times of less than one hour to one week or more being useful. Pressure is not critical but ambient or autogeneous pressure is preferred. The desired fluoro compound can be separated from the reaction mixture by conventional procedures.Preparative chromatography is a particularly useful procedure for separation and purification but other means, for example, crystallization or extraction can be used. All temperatures reported here in are in OC.

Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 95, 729 1957 . A test compound suspended in 1 methlcellulose was given orally to fasted 17 21 hours female white mice, 5 20 animals per double blind test. Aqueous 0.01 phenyl E benzoquinone phenylquinone was injected intraperitoneally at 2d minutes later using 0.20 ml per mouse. Commencing at 30 minutes after the oral administration of the test compound, the mice were observed for 10 minutes for a characteristic stretching or writhing syndrome which is indicative of pain induced by phenylquinone. The effective analgesic dose for 50 of the mice ED 50 was calculated by the moving average method of Thompson,U.R., Bact. Rev. 11 115 145 1947 . This is reported as PQW ED50 in the table below. Some of the compounds of this invention are particularly useful as analgesics by subcutaneous injection for example, the compound 29 of Example 11 had an ED30 of 0.0016 fifteen minutes after injection. Narcotic analgesics produce in mice an erection and arching of the tail 900 or more which is referable to spinal cord stimulation. This Straub tail reaction is not produced by other analgesics, including the narcotic antagonists. The method used was modified from Shemano Shemano, I., and Wendel, H., Tox. ppl. Pharm. 6, 334 9 1964 . CF1S female mice 18 21 g , 10 20 mice per dose were injected subcutaneously with log scaled doses of analgesic in 0.9 saline or 0.45 saline containing 0.5 methylcellulose. A positive Straub tail response was recorded if a tail was erected for 3 seconds at any time within 25 minutes after dosing. A quantal Straub tail ED50 was calculated by the moving average method and is an indication of physical dependence. The narcotic antagonist anti Straub tail property of the compounds is estimated by their ability to prevent morphine induced Straub tail in mice. In this test the compound is injected intraperitoneally into mice and 10 minutes later 53 mg kg of morphine sulfate is given subcutaneously. Prevention of the induction or a 900 Straub tail for minutes after the morphine sulfate injection is considered to wnaicate narcotic antagonism in te compound tested. The following table shows the activity in mg kg exhibited by various compounds Including those of this invention in te hydrochloride salt form to provide solubility , when tested by the procedures given above. k value of 135 ms kg or higher is considered to indicate an inactive compound.
