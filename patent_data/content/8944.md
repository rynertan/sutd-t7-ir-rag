# Hydraulic expansion swaging of tubes in tubesheet.

## Abstract
A method of hydraulically expansion swaging a tube into a tube sheet by abruptly applying a very high pressure pulse to the already pressurized annular space between a hydraulic expansion swaging mandrel core and the tube being swaged. With this method it is possible to obtain a practically zero gap, after removal of the pressure, between the tube and the bore in which it is swaged.
