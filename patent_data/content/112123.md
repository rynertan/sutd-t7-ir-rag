# WASHING AND EXTRACTING MACHINE

## Abstract
A washing and extracting machine 10 includes a frame assembly 52 on which a cylindrical housing 12 is rotatably and pivotally mounted. The housing is connected to the frame assembly by releasable connectors 84 each including a pin 86 secured to the housing and a toggle latch mechanism 108 mounted on the frame and actuated by a actuator 100 . A hydraulic motor 36 is secured to the housing to rotate it relative to the frame. An extensible cylinder 128 is mounted on the frame and to a bracket 132 secured to the cylindrical housing. Upon actuation, the extensible cylinder pivots the housing relative to the frame. The bracket includes a slot 142 in which an end of the extensible cylinder is slidably positioned. A toggle latch 152 is mounted on the bracket to lock the end of the extensible cylinder in the slot during pivoting of the housing.
