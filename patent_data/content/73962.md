## Description
TRANSMISSION V BELTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a transmissionV belt of the kind constructed of a plurality of V shaped blocks arranged in face to face abutting relationship and transversely mounted on an endless band. 2. Description of the Prior Art Japanese Patent Application publicationNo. Sho 55 100443, which corresponds to U.S. Pat.No. 4,303,403, discloses in Figs. 1 and 2 thereof a plate like transverse element or a V shaped block formed with a three sided slot for receiving an endless belt.The V shaped block has two projections on one of head side surfaces thereof and two recesses on the other head side surface thereof for centering purpose. Figs. 1 through 3B of the accompanying drawings of the present application show a transmission V belt employing a plurality of V shaped blocks as disclosed inFigs. 1 and 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,303,403. As shown inFig. 1, the transmission V belt includes an endless band 1 constructed of a plurality of metal strips superimposed one after another and a plurality pairs of differentV shaped blocks 2 see Figs. 2A and 2B and 2 see Figs. 3A and 3B which are complemantary to each other.The V shaped blocks 2 and 2 are disposed sequentially in face to face abutting relationship and transversely mounted on the endless band 1. In assembly, the V shaped block 2 is mounted transversely from one side of the endless band 1 in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the endless band with its three sided slot engaging the endless band 1, while the complemantary V shaped block 2 from the opposite side edge of the endless band 1 in the opposite direction to the first mentioned direction with its three sided slot engaging the endless band 1, thus preventing the endless band 1 from dropping off. Each of the V shaped blocks 2 and 2 has a surface which is in contact with the endless band 1. The V shaped block 2 has inclined lateral side surfaces 2a contactable with the inclined surfaces 5 defining the V groove of the pulley 3 or 4.Similarly, the complementary V shaped block 2 has inclined lateral side surfaces 2 a contactable with the inclined surfaces 5 of the V groove of the pulley 3 or 4. The transmission V belt can be used for transmitting a torque between the two pulleys 3 and 4 in which the spacing between the inclined surfaces 5 of the V groove of each of the pulleys can be varied to provide a continuously variable reduction ratio. In such a V belt transmission belt, power is substantially transmitted between the pulleys 3 and 4 by pushing forces between theV shaped blocks 2 and 2 . The primary pulley 3 drives the V shaped blocks 2 and 2 contacting with the inclined surfaces 4 of the V groove thereof. The power is transmitted by a pushing force by an array of V shaped blocks 2 and 2 to the secondary pulley 4. For preventing relative displacement of the array ofV shaped blocks 2 and 2 , each of the V shaped blocks 2 has projections 2b on one head side surface thereof with respect to the running direction of the band 1 and recesses 2a on the other head side surface thereof with respect to the running direction of the band 1 as shown in Figs. 2a and 2b, and each of the complementaryV shaped blocks 2 has two projections 2 b on one head side surface thereof and two recesses 2 a on the other head side surface thereof as shown in Figs. 3A and 3B.In assembly, the projections 2b of the V shaped block 2 are inserted into the two recesses 2 c on the abutting head side surface of the adjacent complementary V shaped block 2 and the recesses 2c of the V shaped block 2 receive the projections 2 b on the abutting head side surface of the adjacent another complementary V shaped block 2 . With this coupling means, alignment of theV shaped blocks 2 and 2 is accomplished, thus preventing the occurrence of noise which would otherwise take place when the V shaped block comes into contact with the pulley. Problems encountered in the transmission belt so far explained in connection with Figs. 1 through 3B are derived from the use of two kinds of V shaped blocks which are quite similar in configuration although the arrangement of two projections and two recesses are different. One of the problem is in increasing the manufacturing cost and complicating the parts management of the V shaped blocks. Other problem is that, during assembly work of transmission V belt, it occurs frequently to pick out a different V shaped block by mistake, resulting in poor efficiency in assembly work.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, a transmissionV belt comprising an endless band and a plurality of V shaped blocks of identical construction transversely mounted on said endless band and arranged in face to face abutting relationship in a longitudinal direction of the endless band, said V shaped blocks disposed sequentially in a first position and a second position turned through 180 degrees from said first position about an axis perpendicular to a longitudinal plane of said endless band, each of said V shaped blocks having a projection and a recess on one of head side surfaces thereof and a recess and a projection on the opposite head side surface thereof, said projection and recess on said one head side surface of said each V shaped block coupling with the recess and projection of the abutting head side surface of the adjacent V shaped block, respectively, said recess and projection on the opposite head side surface of said one V shaped block coupling with the projection and recess on the abutting head side surface of the adjacentV shaped block. An object of the present invention, thereof, is to provide a transmission V belt wherein a plurality ofV shaped blocks of identical construction are transversely mounted on an endless belt in face to face relationship and disposed sequentially in a first position and a second position that is turned through 180 degrees from said first position about an axis perpendicular to a longitudinal plane of the endless band and the V shaped blocks are centered with each other.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Two embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic elevation of a transmissionV belt explained before Fig. 2A is a cross section of a V shaped block explained before having an endless band in its three sided laterally opening slot and running between inclined surfaces of a V groove of a pulley Fig. 2B is a side view of the V shaped block shown in Fig. 2A Fig. 3A is a similar view to Fig. 2A showing anotherV shaped block complemantary to the V shaped block shown in Fig. 2A Fig. 3B is a side view of the V shaped block shown in Fig. 3A Fig. 4A is a top view of a first embodiment of aV shaped block according to the invention mounted transversely from the left hand side edge of an endless band and disposed in a first position Fig. XB is a similar view to Fig. 2A illustrating the V shaped block shown in Fig. 4A Fig. 4C is a side view as viewing Fig. 4A along an arrow X Fig. 5 is a diagrammatic top elevation of a plurality of the V shaped blocks transversely mounted on the endless band one after another before they are brought into face to face abutting relationship Fig. 6A is a similar view to Fig. 4A showing a second embodiment of a V shaped block according to the invention Fig. 6B is a similar view to Fig. 4B illustrating the V shaped block shown in Fig. 6B Fig. 6C is a side view as viewing Fig. 6A along an arrow Y and Fig. 7 is a similar view to Fig. 5 showing theV shaped blocks shown in Fig. 6A.DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS Referring to Figs. 4A, 4B, 4C and 5 illustrating one embodiment of the present invention, similar parts to those illustrated in Figs. 1 through 3 are denoted by the same reference numerals. Referring to Figs. 4A, 4B and 4C, each of V shaped blocks 6 is transversely mounted on the endless band 1 and has a generally V shaped configuration as shown inFig. 4B having inclined lateral side surfaces 6a and also has a surface 6b frictionally contacting with an endless band 1 on the inner peripheral surface thereof. If each of the V shaped blocks 6 were the same in thickness, they would not smoothly follow a circular arc when they were to be entrained around the pulley 3 or 4 because the adjacent V shaped blocks 6 abut with each other on inward portions thereof in the vicinity of the center of rotation of the pulley 3 or 4.For preventing this, an edge of each of the V shaped blocks has inclined surfaces 6c on both head side surfaces thereof with respect to the running direction of the endless band 1, which inclined surfaces 6c become closer and closer toward each other as approaching toward the center of rotation of the pulley. Each of the V shaped blocks 6 further includes an integrally formed hook 6d which rises from one side edge of the surface 6b that is remote from the center of rotation of the pulley 3 or 4 and extends in parallel to the upper surface to hang over the outer peripheral surface of the endless band 1, the thickness of the hook 6d being set equal to that of the remainder portion of the V shaped block 6. As shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B, the hook 6d extends beyond the center plane 7 of theV shaped block 6. On one head side surface of the hook 6d with respect to the running direction of the endless band 1, a projection 6e and a recess 6f are formed. In the illustrated embodiment the recess 6f is defined by an open end of a through hole 6f. The projection 6e and recess 6f are disposed on the opposite sides of the center plane 7 and equidistant therefrom.On the other head side surface of the hook 6d, a similar projection 6g and a similar recess 6f are formed. The projection 6g and recess 6f are aligned with the projection 6e and recess 6f , respectively, along the longitudinal direction of the endless band 1. Thus, the recess 6f is defined by the other open end of the through hole 6f.The diameter of the through hole 6f should be set a little larger than the diameter of the projection 6e or 6g, and furthermore the total of the amount of height of the projection 6e and that of the projection 6g is smaller than the thickness of the V shaped block 6. A plurality of such V shaped blocks 6 are mounted transversely as shown in Fig. 5 on the endless band 1 and disposed in face to face abutting relationship in the longitudinal direction of the endless band 1. TheV shaped blocks 6 are disposed sequentially in a first position and a second position which is turned through 180 degrees from the first position about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal plane of the endless band 1 in which the endless band 1 lies. In assembly, one V shaped block 6 is mounted transversely from one side edge of the endless band 1 by inserting the endless band 1 into the three sided slot defined by the surface 6b and the hook 6d, and a subsequent one V shaped block 6 is mounted from the opposite side edge of the endless band 1 transversely by inserting the endless band 1 into the three sided slot defined by the surface 6b and the hook 6d.This arrangement wherein the V shaped blocks 6 embrace from the opposite sides of the endless band 1 prevents the endless band 1 from dropping off. For centering purpose, the projection 6e and recess 6f on the one head side surface of each V shaped block 6 are coupled with the recesse 6f and projection 6e on the abutting head side surface of the adjacent V shaped block 6, while, the projection 6g and recess 6 f on the opposite head side surface of the V shaped block 6 are coupled with the recess 6f and projection 6e on the opposite head side surface of the adjacent anotherV shaped block 6. Referring to Figs. 6A, 6B, 6C and 7, the second embodiment is explained. As will be readily understood from the comparison of Fig. 6A with Fig. 4A, the second embodiment has been obtained from the first embodiment only by switching the location of a projection 6e with the location of a recess 6 f. Although not shown, the second embodiment can be obtained from the first embodiment by switching the location of a projection 6g with the location of a recess 6 f. As shown in Fig. 6A, the projection 6e and recess 6 f are aligned with the recess 6t f and projection 6g, respectively. As shown inFig. 7, the V shaped blocks 6 are assembled with the projection 6e and recess 6 f coupled with the recess 6 f and projection 6g on the abutting head surface of the adjacenty V shaped block 6 and with the recess 6 f and projection 6g coupled with the projection 6g and recess 6 f on the adhacent V shaped block 6. It may well be understood that although in each of the above described embodiments, the projections 6e, 6g and recesses 6f , 6f are formed on the hook 6d, they may be formed on the remaining portion of the V shaped block as long as the function of the V belt in not hindered.
