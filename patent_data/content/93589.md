Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is that it provides a process for preparing a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I which comprises the steps of a heating a dialkoxy ethyl thiadiazolylurea of the formula II EMI12.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, or phenyl, R3 is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl, R5 is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl, and R6is hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl,C2 C6 alkynyl, C1 C6 t alkoxy, or R5 and R6 taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attacked form pyrrolidino, piperidino, or morpholino, and X and Y independently are C1 C6 alkoxy in the presence of an inorganic or an organic acid or b dehydrating a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I wherein R4 is hydroxy to provide a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I wherein R2 and R4 combine to complete a double bond or c reacting a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I wherein R is hydroxy with an acylating agent derived from a C1 C6 carboxylic acid to provide a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of 4 formula I wherein R is C1 C alkanoyloxy or d reacting athiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I wherein R4 is hydroxy with an isocyanate of the formula R1NCO or a carbamoyl halide of the formula R1R6NCOC1, wherein R1is as defined above and R6 is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl, to provide a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I wherein R is EMI13.1 or e reacting a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I wherein Ris hydroxy with an amine of the formula di Cl C6 alkyl NH to provide a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I wherein R4 is di Cl C6 alkyl amino or f reacting a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I wherein R4 is hydroxy with aC1 C6 alkyl alcohol in the presence of a mineral acid to provide a thadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I wherein R4 is C1 C6 aloxy. Preparation of thiadiazolylurea intermediate As pointed out earlier, the thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivatives of this invention require, as an initial starting material, a thiadiazolylurea of the formula II EMI14.1 wherein X and Y are C1 C6 alkoxy groups such as methoxy, ethoxy or the like. The thiadiazolylurea intermediates can be prepared by any of several procedures.In a typical procedure, a 2 amino 5 aminosulfonyl1,3,4 thiadiazole is reacted with a haloformate such as phenyl chloroformate to give a thiadiazolyl carbamate, which when reacted with a suitably substituted ethylamine gives the thiadiazolylurea of the invention.Such procedure can be illustrated by the following EMI15.1 The 2 aminothiadiazole sulfonamides, wherein R5 and R6 are as defined above, are known in the art or are available by art known methods. Similarly, the dialkoxy ethylamines of the formula R1NHCH R3 CHXY are well known in the art and some are commercially available. The reaction of a haloformate such as phenyl chloroformate and a 2 aminothiadiazole generally is carried out by combining an excess of haloformate with the thiadiazole in an organic solvent such as pyridine or triethylamine, and stirring the mixture for about 1 to about 24 hours at a temperature of about 0 to about 300C. The product of the reaction, a thiadiazolyl carbamate, is generally isolated by adding the reaction mixture to cold water and then acidifying the aqueous mixture, for instance by the addition of a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. The carbamate product generally precipitates out of solution and can be collected by filtration.The carbamate normally needs no further purification, but if desired it can be crystallized from common solvents such as benzene, acetone, ethyl acetate and the like. The thiadiazolyl carbamate thus formed is next reacted with a 2,2 dialkoxy ethylamine derivative.Typical ethylamines commonly employed include Nmethyl 2,2 dimethoxyethylamine, N ethyl 2,2 diethoxyethylamine, N isobutyl l methyl 2 ethoxy 2 methoxy ethylamine, N phenyl l n hexyl 2 methoxy 2 hexyl oxyethylamine, 2,2 diethoxyethylamine, and the like. The thiadiazolyl carbamate and the ethylamine generally are combined in a mutual organic solvent such as toluene or benzene. The reactants can be utilized in about equimolar amounts, or if desired the ethylamine derivative can be employed in excess. The reaction routinely is substantially complete within about 2 to about 5 hours when carried out at a temperature of about 50 to about 1000C. Isolation of the product, a thiadiazolylurea intermediate of the invention, usually is accomplished by filtration or by simply removing the reaction solvent, for instance by evaporation under reduced pressure. The thiadiazolylurea can be further purified if needed by routine methods, including recrystallization and chromatography. An alternative procedure for preparing the thiadiazolylurea intermediates of the invention comprises reacting a suitably substituted 2,2 dialkoxy ethylamine derivative with a 2 5 aminosulfonyl l,3,4thiadiazolyl isocyanate. The thiadiazolyl isocyanate is conveniently prepared by reacting a 2 aminothiadia zole with phosgene in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid to give the corresponding 2 chlorocarbonylaminothiadiazole. The latter compound undergoes dehydrohalogenation in situ to provide the corresponding thiadiazolyl isocyanate. The reaction of the isocyanate with an ethylamine derivative is illustrated by the following sequence EMI17.1 wherein R1, R3, R5, R6, X and Y are all as heretofore defined.The reaction of an ethylamine with a thiadia zolyl isocyanate generally is carried out by combining approximately equimolar quantities of the reactants in a suitable solvent such as benzene or toluene. The reaction normally is complete within about 2 to about hours when carried out at a temperature of about 50 to about 100 C. Isolation of the product generally is achieved by simply removing the reaction solvent by evaporation under reduced pressure. Further purification, if needed, can be accomplished by crystallization, chromatography or similar conventional methods. Thus, another aspect of the invention is that it provides dialkoxy ethyl thiazolylureas of the formula II EMI18.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl R3is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl R is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl, and This hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl,C2 C6 alkynyl, C1 C6 alkoxy, or R5 and R taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form pyrrolidino, piperidino, or morpholino, and X and Y independently are C1 C6 alkoxy.

Biennials subject to control include wild carrot, wild barley, burdock, bull thistle, houndstongue, and purple star thistle.Other common weeds which can be controlled with the herbicides of this invention include perennial ryegrass, quackgrass, Johnson grass, sheep sorrell, nutgrass, field chickweed, dandelion,Russian Knotweed, horsetail, sesbania, cattail, wintercress, nutsedge, milkweed, sicklepod, black nightshade, and related weeds. The pre emergent and post emergent terrestrial herbicidal activity of several thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivatives of this invention has been determined in standard greenhouse experiments. Such experiments were carried out by first formulating a test compound for convenient soil surface or overtop foliar spray application. The test compound was formulated by dissolving 0.2 percent by weight in a solution containing 4.0 percent by weight acetone, 4.0 percent by weight ethanol, and 91.7 percent by weight of deionized water, and 0.1 percent by weight of a commercial surfactant, for example Toximul R and S, which are blends of anionic and nonionic surface active agents Stepan Chemical Co. Northfield, Illinois, 60093 . The solution containing the test compound was then serially diluted with deionized water to the appropriate volume containing the desired concentration of test compound.The formulated compounds were applied pre emergence and or post emergence to metal greenhouse flats filled with soil and seeded to test plants. The compounds were evaluated at several application rates, initially at 15 pounds per acre 16.8 kg ha and at lower rates until compound activity diminished. Preemergence applications were made to the soil surface of the seeded flats. Post emergence applications were made to the foliage of the various plant species approximately twelve days after seeding. All treated flats were maintained in a greenhouse following treatment.Evaluations of compound activity were made in the form of plant injury rating on a scale of 1 to i. The rating of 1 refers to no plant injury 2 slight Table 15Plant Injury Ratings for 3 5 dimethylaminosulfonyl 1, 3, 4 thiadizol2 yl 4 dimethylamino 1 methyl 2 imidazolidinone of Example 15PLANT

A dash n n in any column means that no evaluation was made at that level on the particular plant species. Evaluations were made from 11 to 14 days after post emergence application, and from 18 to 21 days following pre emergence application. Tables 1 15 which follow presents the herbicidal activity of typical compounds provided by this invention. The data presented in Table 1 demonstrate that 3 5 dimethylaminosulfonyl I, 3,4 thiadiazol 2 yl 4 hydroxy 1 methyl 2 imidazolidinone is effective both as a pre emergence and a post emergence terrestrial herbicide at rates as low as about 1 pound per acre 1.12 kg ha against weeds such as velvetleaf, zinnia, wildoat, foxtail, pigweed and lambsquarter, while having no or only slight adverse affect on desirable plants such as corn, cotton and soybean. The compound is active as a pre emergence herbicide at rates as low as 0.125 pound per acre 0.14 kg ha . The data presented in Table 2 demonstrate that the compound tested is an excellent pre and post emergence herbicide at rates as low as 0.5 pound per acre 0.56 kg ha against commonly occurring terrestrial weeds such as lambsquarter and velvetleaf, while displaying little or no toxic affects to desirable plants such as corn, wheat, rice, alfalfa and the like. Similarly, the data of Table 4 show that a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone of this invention is toxic both pre and post emergence at rates as low as 0.25 pound per acre 0.28 kg ha against weeds such as lambsquarter, crabgrass, and pigweed, while having little or no adverse affect on corn, cotton, soybean, rice, or the like. The data thus far generated indicate that compounds embraced by this invention are useful as selective terrestrial herbicides against common weed varities which are found in desirable crops such as corn, wheat, soybean, and the like. The compounds can also be used in a chemical fallow program, for example in a fallow wheatland weed control program. Thus, a further important aspect of the invention is that it provides a method for controlling the growth of vegetation which comprises applying to the locus where vegetative control is desired a herbicidally effective amount of a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative of formula I as defined above. The practice of the foregoing method can be carried out by applying the herbicidal compounds by any of several art recognized methods. The compounds can be surface applied to soil prior to planting of crops or emergence of seedlings. If desired, the surface applied herbicide can be incorporated into the soil by conventional means such as a double disc or harrow.The compounds can alternatively be applied early postemergence, for instance within about 2 weeks following seedling emergence. The amount of herbicidal thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivatives to be employed in the method of this invention is an amount which is effective in controlling the growth of unwanted vegetation. Such herbicidal amount will depend upon a number of factors, including the method of application, formulation, soil texture, soil moisture content, the expected population of unwanted vegetation, degree of incorporation, the extent of growth control desired, and related factors.The rate of application normally will be from about 0.01 to about 10.0 pounds per acre, and preferably from about 0.25 to about 5.0 pounds per acre. These ranges are equivalent, respectively, to from about 0.011 to about 11.2 kilograms per hectare, and from about 0.28 to about 5.6 kilograms per hectare. The thiadiazolylimidazolidinone and thiadiazolylimidazolinone herbicides to be employed according to the terrestrial method of this invention can be formulated for convenient application as aqueous sprays, drenches, solid powders, dusts and the like. Herbicidal formulations containing a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative as defined herein are provided in a further embodiment of this invention Such formulations will contain from about 1.0 to about 90 percent by weight of active thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative, and can be prepared by combining a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative with any number of common agronomically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjutants and the like. The formulations can contain liquid carriers and adjuvants such as organic solvents, including benzene, xylene, toluene, a halo toluene such as orthochlorotoluene, n hexane, n pentane, kerosene, and similar organic solvents.

The herbicidal thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivatives of this invention can be employed in combination with other herbicides for the effective control of an even broader spectrum of weeds. Well known herbicides which may be utilized together with the herbicides of this invention include diuron, atrazine, trifluralin, metribuzin, simazine, propazine, parauat, and the like. Combinations of the compounds of this invention together with herbicides which are especially effective against grasses are particularly preferred.Typical of such combinations is trifluralin and a compound such as 3 5 dimethylaminosulfonyl 1,3, 4 thiadiazol 2 yl l ethyl 2 imidazolinone. It is contemplated that such combinations will contain the respective herbicides in approximately equal amounts, and that upon application each respective herbicide will be present at about 0.1 to about 5.0 pounds per acre 0.112 to about 5.6 kg ha . The thiadiazolylimidazolidinones of this invention also are useful in the control of unwanted vegetation in a chemical fallow program, for instance in the control of lambsquarter, morningglory, velvetleaf, and similar weeds in fallow wheatland. Combinations with herbicides such as atrazine and trifluralin are particularly useful in a fallow program. The compounds defined herein also are useful in regulating the growth pattern cf plant life without causing total elimination. In order to achieve suc plant growth regulation, the compounds are employed in amounts which are effective to cause growth regulation but are not herbicidal. The compounds are applied directly to the plants or to the locus where the plants to be regulated are growing. The compounds are preferably formulated for post emergence over the top spray application. Typical manifestations of plant growth regulation employing compounds of this invention include stunting, control of flowering, control of fruiting, delay in maturation, reduction in stem growth, improvements in yield, and related regulatory responses. The plant growth regulating properties of the compounds defined herein have been determined by the following test procedure. Test compounds were formulated as a foliar spray by dissolving 50 mg in 25 ml ofToximul Rand Toximul S 50 50 . An aliquot of the solution was further diluted to a concentration of test compound of 1000 parts per million ppm . The formulated test compound was sprayed onto the leaves of squash and bean plants, and the plants were then allowed to dry for two hours. All leaves were then removed from the treated plants, and the plants were placed in a greenhouse. Evaluations for terminal growth and morphological effects were made after five days. Growth regulator activity is rated on a scale of 3 to 3. A indicates growth promotion, while a N Il indicates growth inhibition.The numerical ratings are assigned the meanings 0 no effect 1 slight response 2 moderate response 3 distinct response.Phytotoxicity is indicated according to the following scale B burn C chlorosis X deathThe results of plant growth regulator tests for several representative compounds of the invention are presented in Tables 16, 17, and 18 which follow Table 16Plant Growth Regulator Activity Squash BeanCompound of Concentration Growth Phyto Growth PhytoExample No. ppm Rating toxicity Rating Toxicity 4 1000 1 0 2 0 5 1000 2 0 3 3C 7 1000 0 0 3 3C 13 1000 1 0 2 0 Table 17Plant Growth Regulator ActivityCompound of Concentration Snap beanExample No. ppm Shoot Growth Root Growth 5 100 1 2 7 100 3 3 11 100 1 0 Table 18Plant Growth Regulator ActivityCompound ofExample Concen Mode of Plant No. tration Application Variety Epinasty Abscission Height Branching Injury 4 2000 foliar cotton 0 3 0 3X soybean 2 3 0 3X cucumber 0 3 3X barley 3 3X ryegrass 3 3X 4 5 soil cotton 0 3 3 0 3X soybean 0 3 0 3X cucumber 0 3 3X barley 3 3X ryegrass 3 3X Table 18 continued Plant Growth Regulator ActivityCompound ofExample Concen Mode of Plant No. tration Application Variety Epinasty Alscission Height Branching Injury 5 2000 foliar cotton 0 0 2 0 2B soybean 0 3 0 2X cucumber 0 3 0 3X barley 3 3X ryegrass 2 2B 5 50 soil cotton 0 0 3 0 3X soybean 0 3 0 3X cucumber 0 3 0 3X barley 3 3X ryegrass 2 2B As the data in Tables 16, 17, and 18 demon strata, the compounds of the invention are useful in controlling the growth of plants when applied at nonherbicidal rates. While the particular rate will vary depending upon the growth regulator response desired and the plant species treated, a typical plant growth regulator amount will be from about 0.01 to about 5.0 pounds per acre. The thiadiazolylimidazolidinones of this invention have additionally demonstrated good aquatic herbicidal and plant growth regulator activity, and thus are useful in controlling the growth of aquatic vegetation such as hydrilla, coontail, chara, naiad, duckweed and the like. The compounds are also effective as aquatic algicides and can be employed to control algae such as Chlorella vulgaris, Anacystis nidulans and the like.
