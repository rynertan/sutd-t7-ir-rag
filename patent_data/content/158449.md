## Description
MICROCAPSULES AND MICHOENCAPSULATION PROCESS This invention relates to microcapsules and to a process for their production. In particular, this invention relates to encapsulated droplets of a liquid material which is substantially insoluble in water, where the encapsulating agent is a film formed from a modified urea formaldehyde polymer. The use of membranes, coatings, and capsules for the controlled release of liquid materials is well known in the art of both agricultural and non agricultural chemicals. In agriculture, controlled release techniques have improved the efficiency of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, and fertilizers. Non agricultural uses include encapsulated dyes, inks, pharmaceuticals, flavoring agents, and fragrances. The most common forms of controlled release materials are coated droplets or microcapsules,coated solids including both porous and non porous particles, and coated aggregates of solid particles. In some instances, a watersoluble encapsulating film is desired, which releases the encapsulated material when the capsule is placed in contact with water. Other coatings are designed to release the entrapped material when the coating is ruptured by external force. Still further coatings are porous in nature and release the entrapped material to the surrounding medium at a slow rate by diffusion through the pores. In addition to providing controlled release, such coatings also serve to facilitate the dispersion of waterimmiscible liquids into water and water containing media such as wet soil.Droplets encapsulated in this manner are particularly useful in agriculture, where water from irrigation, rain, and water sprays is frequently present. A variety of processes for produeing such capsules is known. In one process, the capsules are formed by phase separation fran an aqueous solution through the coacervation of a hydrophilic colloid sol. Ihis is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,800,457 Green et al., July 23, 1957 and 2,800,458 Green, July 23, 1957 . An interfacial polymerization process is disclosed in U.S.Patent Nos. 4,046,741 Scher, September 6, 1977 and 4,140,516 Scher,February 20, 1979 , whereby the film forming reactants are dissolved in the hydrophobic liquid which is dispersed in water, the reaction occurring at the interface when the phases are placed in contact as an emulsion. A further interfacial polymerization process is described inU.S. Patent No. 3,726,804 Matsukawa et al., April 10, 1973 whereby all the film forming ingredients initially reside in hydrophobic droplets which also contain a low boiling or polar solvent in addition to the material to be encapsulated. Upon heating, the solvent is released into the aqueous phase the continuous phase of the emulsion , and the filmr forming materials accumulate at the interface and polymerize. Olefin polymerization using a peroxide catalyst is described inJapanese patent publication No. 9168 1961, whereby an oil insoluble poly after is formed at the surfaces of oil drops. British Patent Nos. 952,807 and 965,074 describe a process whereby a solid such as wax or a the plastic resin is melted, dispersed and cooled to form an encapsulating film around liquid droplets. U.S. Patent so. 3,111,407 Lindquist et al., November 19, 1963 describes a spray drying method Which forms encapsulated droplets at the instant of atanization. These processes vary in terms of equipment expense, energy requirements, ease of controlling the microcapsule size, the need for extra reagents such as catalysts and settling agents, and percent microcapsule phase. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a simple inexpensive method for producing microcapsules of uniform and readily controlled size, which are suitable for use without further treatment. Other objects of the invention will be apparent from the following description. Summary of the Invention It has now been discovered that a liquid material which is substantially insoluble in water can be microencapsulated within a porous shell by a process which comprises a providing an organic solution comprising said material and a urea formaldehyde prepolymer in which fran about 50 to about 98 of the methylol groups of said prepolymer have been etherified with a C4 C10 alcohol, b causing an emulsion of said organic solution in an aqueous solution comprising water and a surface active agent, wherein said emulsion comprises discrete droplets of said organic solution dispersed in said aqueous solution, and c causing in situ self condensation of said urea formaldehyde prepolymers by adding to said emulsion an acidifing agent and maintaining said emulsion at a pH of between about 0 and about 4 for a sufficient period of time to allow sub stantial completion of in situ condensation of said resin prepolymers to convert the liquid droplets of said organ ic solution to capsules consisting of solid permeable polymer shells enclosing said liquid material, and d heating said emulsion to a temperature between about 200C and about 100 C to cause curing of said in situ formed polymers. Microcapsules formed by this process are capable of effecting a slow rate of release of the encapsulated liquid by diffusion through the shell to the surrounding medium. The present invention resides in both the process described above and the microcapsules thus formed. Description of the Preferred Enrbodiments The e present invention can be readily adapted to acscnrdate variations in the materials used, the kind of product desired, and economic factors in general. As the following indicates, both essential and optional features of the process and the product thereof can be varied over a wide range.A. Core Liquid It is essential that the organic solution which forms the interior of the capsules i.e., the core liquid be substantially insoluble in water. Preferably, its solubility under ambient conditions is approximately 5000 parts per million ppm by weight or less. The organic solution may consist of a single liquid material or one or more active liquid or solid materials dissolved in an inert solvent which has at most a slight solubility in water. In the latter case, the liquid or solid solute must reside preferentially in the organic phase when the two phases are in equilibrium. A wide variety of liquids can be encapsulated by the present process. The most useful liquids are those which do not react with either the prepolymer, the acid used in the self condensation wall forming step, or any of the other components in the system. Thus, any nonreactive liquid which will diffuse through the shell membrane is suitable. The liquid can be a single chemical compound or a mixture of two or more compounds. It can diffuse into water, soil, air, or any other surrounding medium. Liquids suitable for encapsulation include chemical biological agents such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, nematocides, bactericides, rodenticides, molluscides, acaricides, larvicides, animal, insect, and bird repellents, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, phercmones, sex lures and attractants, and flavor and odor compositions. The microcapsules of the present invention are particularly well adapted to pesticides, including thiocarbamates, d ithiocartrrtes, acetamides, anilines, sulfonamides, triazines, organophosphorus compounds, and pyrethroids, The following are examples of such compounds, folllowed in parentheses by their carmon names where available HERBICIDESS ethyl N cyclohexyl N ethylthiocarbamate cycloate9S

different types of core liquids useful in the present composition, pesticides are preferred, and certain classes of pesticides are particularly preferred.One such class is that of substituted thiocarbamates, particularly those of the formulaEMI7.1 in which R1 is selected fran the group consisting of Q C6 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl, and C7 cg phenylalkyl, and is optionally substituted with up to three groups selected from halogen and nitro and R2 and R3 are either independently C1 C6 alkyl or C5 C7 cycloalkyl, or conjointly form C4 C7 alkylene. The terms alkyl, alkenyl, and walkylenew are intended to include both straight chain and branched chain groups, and all carbon atom ranges are intended to be inclusive of the upper and lower limits stated. More preferred thiocarbamates are those in which R1 is C2 C4 alkyl and R2 and R3 either independently form C2 C4 alkyl or conjointly form hexamethylene. The most preferred are those in which R1, R2, and R3 are all inde pendently C C4 alkyl. Ihiocarbamates are particularly useful as preemergence and postemergence herbicides. One can broaden the variety of crops on which certain pesticides, particularly herbicides, can be effectively used by including an antidote in the composition. The antidote helps to protect the crop from injury by the herbicide, without appreciable effect on the potency of the herbicide against the undesired weed species. The antidote thus renders the herbicide more selective in its action. Useful antidotes include acetamides such as N,N diallyl 2,2 dichloroacetamide and N,N diallyl 2 chioroacetanide, oxazol idines such as 2,2,5 trimethyl N dichloroacetyl oxazolidine and 2, 2 spirocyclohexy N dichloroacetyl oxazolidine, and 1,8naphthalic anhydride. For maximum effect, the antidote is present in the composition in a non phytotoxic, antidotally effective amount.By non phytotoxicn is meant an amount which causes at most minor injury to the crop. By antidotally effective is meant an amount which substantially decreases the extent of injury caused by the pesticide to the crop. The preferred weight ratio of pesticide to antidote is about 0.1 1 to about 30 1. The most preferred range for this ratio is about 3 1 to about 20 1. The utility of many pesticides can also be broadened by the inclusion of synergists in the pesticide composition. Synergists are pounds which have little or no pesticidal activity of their own, but when combined with a pesticide produce a combination with a potency significantly greater than the additive sum of the potencies of the compounds applied individually. Useful synergists include 5 1 12 2 ethoxyethoxy ethoxy ethoxy 1,3 benzodioxole sesamex , 1,4 di 1,3 benzodioxol 5 yl tetrahydrofuro I3,4 cl furan sesamin , l methyl 2 3,4lnethylenedioxy phenyl ethyl octyl suiphoxide sulfoxide , and 5 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethoxymethyl 6propyl 1,3 benzodioxole piperonyl butoxide . ten included synergysts are prezent in effective amounts, i.e. at any pesticide to synergist rat 10 at wnich a synergist effect is observed.This ratio varies widely from one combination to the next.B. Prepolymer Prepolymers suitable to the present invention are partially etherified urea formaldehyde prepolvners with a high solubility in the the organic phase and a low solubility in water. In its non etherified form, the prepolymer contains a large number of methylol groups, CH20R, in its molecular structure.Etherification is the replacement of the hydroxyl hydrogens with all groups, and is achieve by condensation of the prepolymer with an alcohol. When the alkyl groups canprise four car bon atoms or more and they have replaced more than about 50 of the hydroxyl hydrogen atoms on the prepolymer molecule, the prepolymer becomes soluble in the organic phase. Complete etherification is to be avoided, however, since hydroxyl groups are needed for the in situ self condensar tion polymerization which occurs in the wall forming step.Therefore, the prepolymers useful in the present invention are those in which fran about 50 to about 98 of the hydroxyl hydrogen atoms have been replaced by alkyl groups of 4 to 10 carbon atcms each. In preferred practice, about 70 to about 90 of the groups have been etherified with a C4 C6 alcohol. 20th straight chain and branched chain alcohols are useful in the present invention, and all carbon atom ranges quoted herein are to be inclusive of their upper and lower limits. Etherified urea formaldehyde prepolymers are commercially available as solutions in alcohol or in a mixture of alcohol and xylene. The alcohol used as the solvent is normally identical to that used as the etherifying agent. Those in most caacn use are nrbutanol and iso butanol.The degree of etherification butylation in these commercial products ranges between 70 and 90 , and the solution contains from 50 to 85 by weight of prepolymer. Minor amounts of free formaldehyde are also frequently present. These solutions are typically sold as cross linking agents for alkyd resins and used primarily for the formulation of coating and finishing products such as peints and lacquers. Urea formaldehyde prepolymers which have not been etherified are also available camrercially, either in aqeuous solutions or as waterdissolvable solids, for use as adhesives. These can be etherified by condensation with the desired alcohol in a weakly acidic alcohol solution.The water of condensation is distilled off as an azeotrope with the alcohol until the desired degree of condensation etherification has been reached. Urea formaldehyde prepolymers themselves can be prepared by known techniques, notably the base catalyzed reaction between urea and formaldehyde in water at a weight ratio of 0.6 to 1.3 parts formaldehyde to one part urea by weight 1.2 1 to 2.6 1 on a molar basis , at a pE of 7.5 to 11.0 and a temperature of 500C to 900C. Etherification is then accomplished as described in the preceding paragraph. The degree of etherification can be monitored by the quantity of water driven off during the distillation. Although the degree of etherification can be varied over a wide range to accommodate the needs of the reaction system, the rate of polymerization in the subsequent wall forming step decreases as the degree of etherification increases. Tco high a degree of etherification, therefore, tends to inhibit the progress of the wall formation. Bbwever, the water solubility of the prepolymer also decreases with increasing degree of etherification. Since low water solubiity is a desirable feature of the prepolymer, it is best to avoid too low a degree of etherification. Thus, the suitable and preferred ranges are those stated above. The organic solution comprising the core liquid and the etherified prepolymer is most conveniently formed when the latter is predissolved in a solvent, as it is when oommercially sold for the coatings and finishings industry. In the absence of such a solvent, there is a high degree of hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups, and the prepolymer is a waxy solid which is difficult to dissolve in the capsule core liquid.Polar organic solvents are particularly useful for preventing the hydrogen bonding and dissolving the prepolymer examples include alcohols, ketones, esters, and aranatics. When etherifying agents of high chain length are used, aliphatics and other non polar solvents can also be used. The most useful solvents are the same alcohols used as the etherifying agents, the solution being taken directly fran the reaction mixture of the etherification process. The concentration of the prepolymer in the organic phase is not critical to the practice of the invention, but can vary over a wide range depending on the desired capsule wall strength and the desired quantity of core liquid in the finished capsule. It will be most convenient, however, to use an organic phase with a prepolymer con concentration of fran about 1 to about 70 on a weight basis, preferably fran about 5 to about 508. C. Optional Additives Optional additives include solvents, polymerization catalysts, and well mcdifying agents. Solvents provide a means for controlling the wall forming reaction. As explained in Section E below, the reaction occurs when protons come in contact with the urea formaldehyde prepolymer. The organic phase rmst be sufficiently hydrophilic to attract protons to the interface fran the bulk of the aqueous phase, yet sufficiently hydrophobic to prevent large amounts of protons fran crossing the interface and causing polymeri zation to occur throughout the bulk of the droplet. Ad appropriately selected solvent added to the organic phase can correct the character of the organic phase to achieve these results. Clearly, the need for a solvent and the type of solvent needed hydrophobic or hydrophilic depends on the nature of the liquid core material. Aliphatic and alicyclic solvents are examples of hydrophobic solvents, and alcohols and ketones are examples of hydrophilic solvents. The amount of solvent can be varied as needed to achieve the desired results. Catalysts capable of enhancing the wall forming reaction can be placed in either the aqueous or organic phase. Catalysts are generally used when the core material is too hydrophobic, since they serve to attract protons toward the organic phase. Any water soluble catalyst which has a high affinity for the organic phase and is capable of carrying a proton can be used. Carboxylic and sulfonic acids are particularly useful. Dtaples include orthochlorobenzoic acid, 2 phenyi 2,2 dichloro acetic acid, ben25ic acid, salicylic acid, p toluenesulronic acid and dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid. The same catalytic effect can be accomplished by dissolving salts of these acids in the aqueous or organic phase and then acidifying the aqueous phase.The acid form is produced by ion exchange. Wall modifying agents serve to modify the character of the wall by varying its permeability to the core material. Suitable wall modifying agents contain a substantial number of hydroxyl or mercapto groups capable of reacting with the methylol groups on the prepolymer. The wall modifier can be used to add multiple linkages to the methylol groups to increase the degree of cross linking, or to exhaust active sites on the prepolymer to decrease the degree of crosslinking. Ihus, depending on the kind of modifier used and the ratio of modifier to prepolymer, the permeability of the wall and consequently the release rate of the core liquid can be either increased or decreased. Castor oil is one example of such an agent.D. Emulsion Formation Once the organic solution is formed, an emulsion is formed by dispersing the organic solution in an aqueous solution comprising water and a surface active agent. The relative quantities of organic and aque ous phases are not critical to the practice of the invention, and can vary over a wide range, limited mostly by convenience and ease of handling. In practical usage, the organic phase will comprise a maximum of about 55 by volume of the total emulsion and will comprise discrete droplets of organic solution dispersed in the aqueous solution. The surface active agent can be any of the wide variety of pounds known to be useful for lowering the surface tension of a fluid interface. nionic and anionic types are both useful. Examples of nonionic agents are long chain alkyl and mercaptan polysthoxy alcohols, alkylaryl polytthoxy alcohols, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, alkyl polyether alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polycxyethy lene ethers, and polyethylene glycol esters with fatty or rosin acids.Examples of anionic agents are the calcium, gamine, alkanolamine, and alkali salts of alkyl and alkylaryl sufonates vegetable sulfonates and ethoxylated and propoxylated mono and diethers of phosphoric acid.Blends of surface active agents are also useful. Preferred surface active agents are polyethylene glycol ethers of linear alcohols and alkali salts of alkyl and alkylaryl sulfonates. The quantity of surface active agent is not critical to the invention, and can vary over a wide range. For convenience, the agent generally comprises from about 0.1 to about 5.08 by weight of the aqueous phase. The agent can be added before or after the emulsion is formed. In somesystems, emulsion stability can be enchanced by adding a protective colloid to the aqueous phase. A protective colloid stabilizes a dispersed system against aggregation, flocculation, and coalescense.Many materials are known to function as protective colloids and are available commercially, including polyvinyl alcohols, alginates, alpha and gartina protein, casein, methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, gelatin, glues, natural gums, polyacids, and starch. The colloid can be added to the aqueous phase prior to the formation of the emulsion, or to the emulsion itself after it has been formed. Although the colloid is an optional additive, its inclusion in the present system is preferred. Polyvinyl alcohol protective colloids are particularly preferred. Additional compounds which serve as protective colloids are the salts of lignin sulfonate, such as the sodium, potassium, magnesium, cal cim or amonium salts. among commercial lignin sulfonates are Treaxa, ITS, LTK and LTM, respectively, the potassium, magnesium and sodium salts of lignosulfonate 50 aqueous solutions , Scott Paper Co., ForestChemical Products Marasperse CRO and Marasperse CBOS 3 commat , sodium lignosulfonate, American Can Co. Polyfon Or, Polyfon TR, Reax88R, Reax 85R, sodium salts of lignin sulfonate and Reax C 21 commat , calcium salt of lignin sulfonate, Wµstvaco Polychemicals Orzan S and Orzan A, the sodium and ammonium salts of lignosulfonate, ITT Rayonier, Inc. The actual quantity of colloid is not critical and any amount which is effective in enhancing the stability of the emulsion can be used.It is most convenient to use between about 0.1 and about 5.0 colloid by weight in terms of the aqueous phase. The droplet size in the emulsion is not critical to the invention. For greatest utility of the final product, the droplet size will fall in the range of about 0.5 microns to about 4000 microns in diameter.The preferred range for most pesticidal applications is from about 1 micron to about 100 microns in diameter. The emulsion is prepared by the use of any conventional high shear stirring device. Once the desired droplet size is attained, mild agitation is generally sufficient to prevent droplet growth throughout the balance of the process.E. Wall Formation Once the dispersion and desired droplet sile are attained, the system is acidified to a pH of between about 0 and about 4.0, preferably between about 1.0 and about 3.0. This causes the etherified urea formal dehyde prepolymer to polymerize by self oondensing in situ and form a shell completely enclosing each droplet. Acidification can be acoom plished by any suitable means, including adding any acid which is watersoluble, including formic acid, citric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.Acidification can also be achieved by the use of acidic dispersants or surface active agents, provided that such components are added to the system after the emulsion has been formed. As the polymer wall becomes more rigid, contact between the active gros on the prepolymer becomes increasingly more difficult.Thus, the in situ self condensation polymerization reaction is selfterminating and is generally allowed to run to completion. The reaction can be arrested before completion, however, by raising the pH. In this manner, the wall tightness, rigidity, and permeability can be controlled. This can also be accocplished in most cases by a wall modifier as described above. The rate of the in situ self condensation polymerization reaction increases with both acidity and temperature depending upon the pH.The reaction can therefore be conducted anywhere within the range of about 20iC to about 100 0C, preferably between about 40 C and about 70 C. The reaction will generally be complete within a few hours, although with high acidity and high temperature, the reaction can be completed within minutes. Once the capsules are formed, they can be stored and used as an aqueous dispersion, or filtered and recovered as dried capsules. In either form, the capsules are useful and effective in the slow release of the core liquid. Dispersions are preferably stabilized by dispersants dissolved in the continuous phase. Since most dispersants are more effective in neutral or basic solutions, it is preferable to raise the pH of the dispersion once the wall has been formed. This is accomplished by any water soluble base. Any conventional dispersant can be used. Typical dispersants include lignin sulfonates, polymeric alkylnaphthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthalene sulfonate, polymethylene bis naphthalene sulfonate, and sodiumN methyl num N long chain acid taurates. The following examples are offered as illustration of both the process and product of the present invention, and are intended neiter to define nor limit the invention in any manner. MAMPLE 1 An aqueous solution was prepared, canprising 2.0 weight Gelvatol0 40 20 and 0.3 Tergitols 15 5 7, with a total solution weight of 300 g. Gelvatol 40 20 is a polyvinyl alcohol protective colloid degree of hydrolysis 73 77 , with an average molecular weight of about 3000, obtained from Monsanto Company, Indian Orchard, Massachusetts. Tergitol 15 S 7 is a nonionic surfactant consisting of a polyethylene glycol ether of a linear alcohol, obtained fran Union Carbide Chemicals and PlasticsCompany, New York, New York. In a separate vessel, 100 g of S ethyl diisobutylthiocarbamate a herbicide known by the common name butylate and 50 g of Bedcamine0 21 625 were blended into a homogeneous solution. Beckamine 21 625 is a 70 75 n butanol solution of a partially butylated ureaformaldehyde prepolymer in which the degree of butylation is approximately 80 90 , obtained from Reichhold Chemicals, Inc., White Plains, New York. The thiocarbamate prepolymer solution was, added to the aqueous solution and an emulsion was formed by means og a high shear stirrer, the organic solution forrind the dispersed phase with droplets ranging in size from 5 to 40 microns in diameter. While mild agitation was maintained, the pH of the emulsion was adjusted to 2.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the temperature was raised to 50 C for three hours. The resulting suspension was then allowed to cool to room tempera ture and concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide was added to raise the pH to 7.0. Observation of the suspension under both a laboratory microscop and an electron microscope revealed discrete, roughly spherical, fully enclosed capsules with smooth surfaced outer walls. The capsules were about 5 to 40 microns in diameter and although some were touching each other, none were fused together. EXAMPLE 2 An organic solution was prepared, comprising 162.2 g of 2 methoxy 9 p sioprtopylphenyl 2,6 dimethylnonane a known insect maturation inhibitor see U.S. Patent tio. 4,002,769, issued January 11, 1977, toSchwarz et al. and 48.0 g of ResimeneR X 918. me latter is a 70 n butanol solution of a partially butylated ureaformaldehyde prepolymer with a degree of butyl at ion of approximately 80 90 , a product of MonsantPlastics and Resins Company, Newport Beach, California. This solution was added to an aqueous solution comprising 168. g of water and 1.87 g of Gelvatol 40 20 and an emulsion was formed as in Example 1, with droplets ranging in diameter fan 1 to 40 microns. To this emulsion was added 20 g of water containing 1.87 g each of the dispersants Lomar NCOR and 2. The former is a product of DiamondShamrock Chemical Company, Nopco Division, Morristown, New Jersey, and is a sodium salt of a condensed mcnonaphthalene sulfonic acid. The latter a product of R.T. Vanderbilt Company, Inc., NorwIk, Connecticut, and is comprised of sodium salts of polymerized substituted benzoic alkyl sufon acids.A 5 hydrochloric acid solution was added to lower the pH of the emulsion to 2.0 and the temperature was raised to 500C with continued stirring for three hours. The resulting dispersion was then cooled to roan temperature and concentrated caustic solution was added to raise the pH to 9.0. Microscopic observation of the dispersion revealed fully formed, discrete capsules as in Example 1. EXAMPLE 3 The organic solution for this example consisted of 139.9 g ofO ethyl S phenyl ethylphosphonodithioate a commercial insecticide also known by the common name tfonofos and 39.9 g of Resimene X 918. This solution was emulsified in an aqueous solution consisting of 200 g of water and 2.35 g of Gelvatol 40 20 to a droplet size of 1 to 40 microns, and 35 g of water containing 2.35 g each of the dispersants Lomar NO andDarvan µ2, as well as 2.4 g of p toluene sulfonic acid, was added. The temperature was raised to 600C and stirring was continued for three hours.The dispersion was then allowed to cool to roan temperature and the pE was raised to 9.0 with caustic solution. Microscopic observation of the dispersion revealed fully formed, discrete capsules as in Example 1. EXAMPLE 4 The organic solution for this example consisted of 156 g of HI SQL 4 3 and 43.5 g of Beckamine 21 625. The former is a heavy aroma tic naphtha, with boiling temperature ranging from 2380C to 2860C, a product of Ashland Chemical Company, Industrial Chemicals and SolventsDivision, Columbus, Ohio. This solution was emulsified in an aqueous solution consisting of 194.6 g of water, 3.9 g of Gelvatol 40 20, and 7.8 g of Darvan num 2, to a droplet size of 1 to 40 microns. The pH was adjusted to 2.0 with a 5 solution of hydrochloric acid and the temperature was raised to 50 C with continued stirring for three hours. The dispersion was then allowed to cool to room temperature and the pE was raised to 9.0 with caustic solution. Microscopic observation revealed fully formed, discrete capsules as in Example 1. EXAMPLE 5 An aqueous solution consisting of 251.6 g of water, 5 g ofGelvatol 40 20, and 2.5 g of TamolR SN was heated to 50 C. Tamol SN is a dispersant identified as a sodium salt of a condensed naphthalene sulfonic acid, obtained from Rohm and Haas Goçxsy, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. To this heated aqueous solution was added an organic solution consisting of 173.4 g of S ethyl diisobutylthiocarbanate butylate , 7.5 g of N,N di allyl dichloroacetamide, and 22.5 g of Resimene X 918. The thiocarbamate acetamide combination is a known herbicide antidote combination seeU.S. Patent No. 4,021,224, issued May 3, 1977, b Pallos et al.An emulsion was formed by means of a high speed stirrer as in the above examples, to a droplet size of 1 to 40 microns. The high temperature was maintained and the pH was lowered to 2.0 with 5 hydrochoric acid. After three hours of additional stirring, the dispersion was oooled to roan temperature and the pH was raised to 9.0 with caustic solution.
