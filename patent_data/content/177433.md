# Leakage detection and tracking system.

## Abstract
Leakage monitoring for a nacelle forcing a turbine type power plant powering aircraft is achieved by measuring the pressure inside and outside or ambient of the nacelle with and without a given quantity of flow added inside the nacelle and calculating the leakage by use of the isentropic flow curve. Temperatures may also be sensed at different stations within the nacelle to predict the location of the leakage.
