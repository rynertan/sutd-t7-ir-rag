## Description
The present invention refers to new partially retro inverso peptide derivatives which are analogues to the bradykinin potentiating peptide BPP More particularly the present invention relates to new partially retro inverso peptides of the following general formula Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts of the compounds of formula I with various organic and inorganic acids and bases. Such salts, which may conveniently be prepared by conventional methods such as by reacting the free acid or free base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent or medium wherein the salt is insoluble or in a solvent which is then easily removed, include ammonium salts, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases e.g. N methyl D glucamine and dicyclohexylamine, salts with basic amino acids e.g. arginine and lysine, and the like also salts with organic or inorganic acids such as HCl, HBr, H₂SO₄, H₃PO₄, sulphonic acids, oxalic acid, acetic acid, pivalic acid and the like. While the non toxic physiologically acceptable salts are preferred, other salts may also be useful e.g. in isolating or purifying the product. A preferred group of compounds of the present invention comprises those compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is selected from the group consisting of methyl, 2 propyl, 2 butyl, and 2 methyl 1 propyl corresponding to the side chains of alanine, valine, isoleucine and leucine and R² is selected from the group consisting of benzyl, 4 hydroxy benzyl, and 4 imidazolylmethyl, corresponding to the side chains of phenylalanine, tyrosine and histidine respectively, X is as defined above and Z is hydroxy or alkoxy. A most preferred group comprises those compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is methyl, corresponding to the side chain of alanine, R² is benzyl, corresponding to the side chain of phenylalanine, X is as defined above and Z is hydroxy. The compounds of the present invention which inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme Over the past decade, in fact, a mass of data has accumulated supporting a major role for the renin angiotensin aldosterone system in determining the onset of hypertension. It is now clear that the action of renin on a pseudoglobulin of blood plasma produces the decapeptide angiotensin I, which is quickly converted to the active pressor agent, the octapeptide angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, besides exerting a powerful vasoconstricting action on the arterial smooth muscle, acts directly on the adrenal gland to stimulate aldosterone secretion which in turn produces sodium retention. Conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II is brought about by the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE which is also responsible for inactivating bradykinin, a nonapeptide with powerful hypotensive action. The net result of this daul action by the angiotensin converting enzyme is an increase in arterial blood pressure. Recently, peptides which potentiate bradykinin activity, have been isolated from some low molecular weight fractions extracted from the venom of the Bothrops Jararaca snake. Further studies have shown that these peptides are also active as ACE inhibitors. Among these peptides, the pentape ptide Glp Lys Trp Ala Pro BPP The interest of such inhibitors resides in the possibility of reducing or controlling the angiotensin related hypertension due to the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II by the angiotensin converting enzyme or kinase II in mammals. Compounds which inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme may be useful as antihypertensive agents in the treatment of renal hypertension, malignant hypertension and essential hypertension. These inhibitors are also useful as diagnostics. In fact, in the long term treatment of hypertension, the possibility of determining the degree of involvement of the renin angiotensin system by the use of ACE inhibitors, would be of great importance in choosing the therapeutic treatment. The pentapeptide BPP However, as also the Ondetti M.A. et al. Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, Chap. 9, 88, 1978 reports in fact a complete loss of inhibitory activity after 15 minutes of preincubation of BPP According to Italian patent application 24369 A 82, BPP The obtained compound, i. e. the pentapeptide Glp Lys gPhe mAla Pro OH, when tested It has now been found that by replacing the proline residue in the retro inverso peptide sequence with a proline residue C substituted with a S or O CH₂ group, the ACE inhibitory activity of the obtained compounds is very high only 10 times lower than that of the natural product while their stability in the presence of the enzyme is quite remarkable. In particular, comparative experiments carried out While compounds c , d and e are quickly degraded, The compounds of the present invention are therefore useful in treating hypertension and other related clinical conditions. To this purpose the compounds of this invention may be utilized in solid or liquid dosage forms such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration, or sterile solutions or suspensions for intravenous or intramuscular administration. It is apparent to any skilled person that the daily dosage to be administered to patients in need of such treatment to provide optimal pharmaceutical efficacy will vary from patient to patient depending upon the nature and severity of the disease, the patient s weight, the route of administration and other possible concurrent medical treatments. However, a suitable daily dosage will generally be about 1 to 1000 mg, preferably administered in 2 or 3 subdivided doses. Preferably, a dosage range will be about 2.5 to 250 mg and more preferably about 2.5 to 100 mg per day per patient. The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in combination with other antihypertensive agents known in the art or currently used in therapy. Typically, the compounds of the invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient of formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, and, optionally, additional antihypertesively active ingredients, compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavoring agent etc. in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active principle in these compositions is such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated above is obtained. The compounds of formula I are readily prepared through condensation of a N monoacylated gem diamino residue of the formula The condensation reaction is typically carried out by contacting about equimolar proportions of the reaction partners and the coupling agent at a temperature comprised between 10 C and room temperature, in the presence of a highly polar, aprotic organic solvent. Suitable solvents are for instance di methylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like solvents. Preferably the condensation is carried out by slowly adding a solution of an acid addition salt of the compound of formula II wherein R² is as defined above and the functional group, if any, of the radical R², as well as the lysine amino group are suitably protected, in the presence of an acid accepting agent such as a tertiary amine, to a solution of the reactant of formula III and the coupling agent. Once the condensation is over, the temporary protecting groups are removed and the obtained peptide of formula I is recovered and purified, for istance, by extraction, counter current distribution, precipitation, crystallization or chromatographic methods. In compounds of general formula I, the carbon atom to which R¹ is attached may have the L or D configuration while all the other amino acid moieties of the sequence have the L configuration. The compounds accordingly exist in two isomeric forms or in mixtures thereof. If a reactant of formula III having a fixed configuration at the C R¹ atom is used in the above process, only one isomer of the compounds of formula I is selectively obtained. Alternatively, if desired, when a mixture of isomers is obtained, it can be separated by conventional chromatographic methods, typically reverse phase HPLC, into the single pure isomers. Although the amino acid partial structure Typically, purification as well as separation into the single isomers, can be achieved by reverse phase HPLC, using a Lichroprep 25 40 µm resin Merck as the stationary phase and eluting with a CH₃CN H₂O mixture containing 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid. Product identity is confirmed by NMR. Product purity is checked by reverse phase HPLC RP HPLC using the following eluting systems H₂O MeCN, TFA 0.1 in aqueous MeCN solution and by silica gel tlc using the following eluting systems n butanol acetic acid water 4 1 1 chloroform methanol acetic acid 85 10 5 n butanol isopropanol 1N NH₄OH ethyl acetate 1 1 5 1 , organic phase. The starting compounds of formulas II and III may be prepared easily according to known techniques such as for instance the peptide synthesis method described by Bodonszki M. and Ondetti M.A. in Peptide Synthesis, Interscience, N.Y., 1976 and The Peptides, Vol. 1, Gross E. and Meienhofer L.Ed., Academic Press, New York, 1979.
