# Cosmid cloning vectors.

## Abstract
A bi functional, hybrid cosmid cloning vector capable of replication in both Eschericia coli and in Streptomycetes is constructed by a cleaving a broad host range Streptomycete plasmid vector at a particular endonuclease sensitive restriction site b ligating DNA from a plasmid from an E. coli host to the cleaved plasmid to form a hybrid vector having two of said sites and c inserting cohesive end sequences excised from a suitable source into said hybrid vector by cleaving the latter at a suitable site and ligating the cohesive end sequences to the cleaved hybrid vector. The particular cosmid cloning vector pPZ74 is described. Such vectors are useful for the construction of gene libraries in E. coli, which can then be transferred back into Streptomyces without further DNA manipulation.

## Description
This invention relates to cosmid cloning vectors and in particular to a cosmid vector capable of gene cloning in a wide variety of Streptomycetes, including the oxytetracycline producing organism Streptomyces rimosus. Cosmids are plasmids having within their structure cohesive end sites, which enable them to be used as vectors for gene cloning in conjunction the phage packaging technique, described by Collins andHohn in Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 75, 4242 4246 1978 and also in BritishPatent no. 2017754 and U.S. Patent 4304863. The present invention provides a novel hybrid cosmid cloning vector, which has been constructed in such a way as to be bi functional, i.e. it is capable of replication in both Escherichia coli and in Streptomycetes. Gene cloning can therefore be carried out in E. coli using this vector and the packaging technique of Collins and Hohn, and the vector can then be transformed into Streptomycetes as well as into E. coli. The advantage of gene cloning with a cosmid vector using the packaging technique of Collins and Hohn is that relatively large DNA inserts can be used. In the construction of genomic DNA libraries, the number of clones to be screened is related both directly to genome size and inversely to the average size of the DNA inserts. It follows therefore that to minimise the number of clones to be screened, the size of the DNA insert should be maximised. Streptomyces have a 4 genome complexity of 10 kb. The binomial theorem predicts that a genomic library prepared with Streptomycete DNA of.average size 5kb typical for cloning experiments would need to contain 6000 independent clones to have a 95 probability that all of the genomic sequences were represented.Increasing the size of the DNA insert to 30kb would reduce the number of clones to be screened to 1000. This reduction would be particularly useful when no selection strategy e.g. phenotypic expression in a blocked mutant or auxotroph was available to screen for the clone of interest and where labourintensive screens using enzyme or product assays have to be employed.However, it is difficult technically to prepare libraries with such large inserts using conventional vectors. The bi functional cosmid vector of this invention will select for clones with insert size 25 40kb and by using it gene libraries can be constructed in E. coli and transferred back into Streptomyces without further DNA manipulation. More specifically, the invention provides a novel hybrid cosmid designated pPZ74. The cosmid pPZ74 is constructed according to the invention from a plasmid, pPZ12, obtainable from a strain of Streptomyces albus AT95 containing it, which was deposited for the purposes of patent procedure under the Budapest Treaty in the Culture Collection of theNational Collection of Industrial and Marine Bacteria at the TorryResearch Station, in Aberdeen, Scotland, on 12th December, 1983 and has received the accession number NCIB 11936. In general, to construct a hybrid cosmid cloning vector according to the invention, a broad host range Streptomycete plasmid vector e.g. pPZ12 is cleaved at a particular endonuclease sensitive, restriction site e.g. a Pst I sensitive site and DNA from a plasmid from an E. coli host e.g. pBR325 is ligated to the cleaved plasmid to form a hybrid, bi functional vector having two of such sites. Cohesive end sequences excised from a suitable source e.g.plasmid pBTI 1 are then inserted into the hybrid vector by cleaving the latter at a suitable site e.g. one of the Pst I sensitive sites and ligating the cohesive end sequences to the cleaved hybrid vector, thus forming the hybrid cosmid of the invention. Preferably, the Streptomycete plasmid vector contains a single restriction site which will be unique in the final hybrid cosmid of the invention and which will provide a suitable cleavage site for insertion of donor DNA having the desired 25 40kb size. Such DNA will have been cut restricted by a restriction enzyme such as Sau 3A orTaq I which cuts that DNA frequently thereby generating, by partial digestion, random DNA fragments of donor organism, including fragments of 25 40kb. The restriction enzyme chosen to digest the donor DNA will of course be such as to provide fragments which can be inserted at the unique restriction site in the hybrid cosmid vector. For example, the restriction enzyme Sau 3A will provide DNA fragments which can be inserted at a unique Bgl II sensitive site in the cosmid vector.Thus, a Bgl II site may be inserted in place of the unique Sst I site in the Streptomycete plasmid pPZ12, before insertion of pBR325 DNA, to provide the desired unique Bgl II site in the hybrid cosmid of the invention. The techniques used for cleaving plasmid DNA at specific sites and ligating DNA from another source to the cleaved DNA, and the designations of the particular enzymes used, are well known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the laboratory manual Molecular Cloning by T. Maniatis et al Cold Spring HarborLaboratory, 1982 . The following is an Example of the construction of a hybrid cosmid cloning vector according to the invention, namely pPZ74, which is also illustrated in Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings.Temperatures are given Celsius. EXAMPLE a Preparation of plasmid pPZ34 Plasmid pPZ12 is isolated from Streptomyces albus AT95 using the method described by Chater et al, Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, 1982, 96, 69 95. The isolated plasmid DNA is finally dissolved in water to produce a concentration of lpg of pPZ12 per Spl of water. Its unique Sst I site is replaced by a Bgl II site by the following technique. 10 g of the plasmid pPZ12 in 50pl water are incubated with 50 units of the restriction enzyme Sst I Bethesda Researcb Laboratories Inc. BRL , catalogue no. 5222SA in the assay buffer specified by the supplier, at 37 for 2h, in a total reaction volume of 250pal. The DNA is precipitated by adding 2 volumes 625pl of absolute ethanol, centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min and dried under vacuum. The DNA is then dissolved in 20pl water and incubated with 0.5 units of nuclease Bal 31 New England Biolabs Inc., Catalogue no. 213 in the assay buffer specified by the supplier at 300 for 3 min in a total reaction volume of lOOpl. The reaction is terminated by adding lOpl of a 0.2M solution pH 8 of EGTA ethylene glycol bis B aminoethyl etherl N,N1 tetra acetic acid and the DNA precipitated with ethanol, centrifuged and dried, as before. The DNA is again dissolved in 20pl water and incubated with 5 units of DNA polymerase Klenow, large fragment Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Catalogue no. 152 692 in the buffer specified by the supplier in a total volume of 100l at 200 for 30 min. The reaction is terminated by heating at 650 for 10 min and the DNA precipitated with ethanol, centrifuged and dried, as before. The DNA is redissolved in 20pl water and ligated with a 50 fold molar excess of Bgl II linker New EnglandBiolabs, Cat. No. 1001 in accordance with the supplier s instructions. The reaction mixture is then used to transform protoplasts of Streptomyces albus, by the method described inExample I c of our patent application Ref.PLC 387 filed concurrently herewith , the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, but using Streptomyces albus instead ofEMI5.1 S. rimosus 4018S. The host cells are regenerated and thiostrepton resistant colonies are selected and purified as described in Example I d and e of that application. These colonies should contain the plasmid pPZ34, which includes a unique Bgl II sensitive site this is confirmed by isolating plasmid DNA from the colonies by the method already described for pPZ12 and showing that it is cleaved by the restriction enzyme Bgl II.Preparation of plasmid pPZ54 lOpg of plasmid pPZ34 dissolved in 50pl water are incubated with 50 units of the restriction enzyme Pst I BRL Cat. No. 5215SA in the assay buffer specified by the supplier, at 370 for 2h, in a total reaction volume of 250pal. The cleaved pPZ34 plasmid DNA is precipitated with ethanol, centrifuged and dried, as before. 10pig of the plasmid pBR325 prepared as described on pp 92 94 of the laboratory manual Molecular Cloning , already referred to are also digested with the restriction enzyme Pst I, as described above, precipitated with ethanol, centrifuged and dried, as before. This DNA is redissolved in 100l of 0.1M glycine buffer pH 10.2 and incubated with 5 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase Boehringer Mannheim Cat. No. 108 154 for 30 min at 37 . The reaction is terminated by heating at 65 for 10 min and precipitated with ethanol, centrifuged and dried, as before. The DNA is redissolved in 20pl water and mixed with the cleaved pPZ34 plasmid DNA, also redissolved in 20pl water and incubated with T4 DNA ligase BRL, Cat.No. 5224SB in the assay buffer specified by the supplier, at a total DNA concentration of 20jug per ml, at 14 for 16h. The DNA is precipitated with ethanol, centrifuged and dried, as before, redissolved in 20yl water and used to transform competent cells of E. coli strain MC1061 Casadaban et al, J. Mol. Biol. 1980, 138, 179 by the method described on pp.250 1 of the laboratory manual Molecular Cloning , already referred to.Chloramphenicol resistant, tetracycline resistant, ampicillin sensitive colonies are selected which should contain the plasmid pPZ54, which now includes plasmid DNA from pBR325 as well as from pPZ34 this is confirmed by isolating plasmid DNA from the colonies as already described for pPZ12 and showing that the DNA is susceptible to cleavage by restriction enzymes in the predicted manner. c Preparation of hybrid cosmid pPZ74 10pig of plasmid pPZ54 dissolved in 50pl water are incubated with 2 units of the restriction enzyme Pst I in assay buffer as previously specified at 370 for 30 min in a total reaction volume of 250pal. The reaction is terminated by heating at 650 for 10 min and the reaction mixture loaded onto an 0.8 agarose gel and subjected to electrophoresis as described on pp 150 167 of the laboratory manual Molecular Cloning already referred to. The 12kb linear DNA component of the mixture is recovered from the gel, redissolved in 0.1M glycine buffer, incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, the reaction terminated and the DNA recovered and redissolved in 20pl water, all as previously described in b . 20pug of plasmid pBTI 1 Boehringer Mannheim,Cat. No. 674 222 is digested with the restriction enzyme Pst I in assay buffer as previously specified , loaded onto a 8.0 polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis, as described on pp. 173 178 of the laboratory manual, Molecular Cloning already referred to. The smaller fragment is recovered from the gel, precipitated with ethanol, centrifuged and dried, as before, and redissolved in 20pl water. This is then mixed with the solution of alkaline phosphatase treated 12kb linear DNA component and incubated with T4 DNA ligase, as previously described in b , and the DNA precipitated with ethanol, centrifuged and dried, as before. This is then used to transformE. coli MC1061, as described in b and chloramphanicolresistant, tetracycline resistant, ampicillin sensitive colonies are selected which should now contain the hybrid cosmid pPZ74 according to the invention. This is confirmed by isolating plasmid DNA from the colonies as already described for pPZ12 and showing that the DNA is susceptible to cleavage by restriction enzymes in the predicted manner.A restriction map of the hybrid cosmid pPZ74 is shown in Fig. 2 of the accompanying drawings.
