## Description
Method and device for automatic level controlThe invention concerns a method and a device for automatic adjustment and level control of molten metal in a metal casting process, strip casting in particular.Continuous casting of wide aluminium and aluminium alloy strips requires advanced technology and equipment in order to achieve uniform product quality. Finished cast strips with a thickness of 5 to 10 mm are used as semi manufactured products for further treatment rolling into sheets foils making heavy demands on the surface quality and internal structures such as uniform grain size, no occlusions etc. A uniform supply of metal without fluctuations in the casting mould casting nozzle is among the most important factors affecting the strip quality.Adjustment and control of the metal volume and temperature is often a complex process comprising several control stages.U.S. Patent No. 3.405.757, for instance, describes a classic adjustment system incorporating a float chamber placed between a crucible casting furnace and a fireproof, lined gutter to the casting machine. A float following the movement of the metal level in the chamber is designed to change the position of a valve member that is moved in and out of the tap hole in the furnace wall. A two way limit switch connected to a motor pressure or electrically driven sees to it that the valve body is adjusted and moved between two predetermined level positions. Unfortunately, such an on off adjustment has proven unable to provide the accuracy required, and it does not ensure even, fluctuation free feed of the metal to the casting machine. Furthermore, due to time delay between signal for actuation and change of valve position, the known adjustment systems are not suitable for fine tuned metal adjustment in an integrated control system for a continuous strip casting process.The level control device for molten metal is applied in an environment characterized by high temperatures, dust, and it is also exposed to metal spray, corrosive atmosphere etc.Consequently, there are strict requirements for a simple, robust but reliable and accurate adjustment system, and it is not possible to use the more sophisticated adjustment systems developed for other processing industries.Consequently, it is the object of this invention to provide a method and a device for automatic level control of molten metal which is continually self adjusting towards the predetermined metal level and which furthermore automatically ensures adjustment of a new metal level as part of a complex control system for the casting process.These and other objects and advantages of the invention are achieved by means of a method and device, the new and unique features of which will be stated in more detail in the following specification and patent claims and illustrated by means of the attached drawings, Figs. 1 and 2, of whichFig. 1 shows schematically a level control device, andFig. 2 shows a cross section of the device as taken along line I I in Fig. 1. The device for automatic adjustment and level control as shown in Fig. 1 comprises a float 1 placed in a float or level chamber 2 which is connected via tap hole 3 to the casting gutter 7 supplying the metal from the crucible not shown in the figure . A plug rod 5 with a plug adjusting the degree of opening of the tap hole is connected to an air diaphragm motor 8 via an arm lever 6 and an attachment link. The air diaphragm motor 8 is connected to a relief valve not shown in the figure controlled by the float 1 which floats on the surface of the metal 9 in the float chamber by means of inclination of a float arm 10 fixed to a slide system 11 . The slide system 11 is connected to a servomotor 13 enabling raising lowering of the float, and thus the metal level, even by remote control.Fig. 2 shows the device in cross section as taken along lineI I in Fig. 1 with the float 1 in the float chamber 2 , the tap hole 3 and the plug rod 5 for opening adjustment controlled by the air diaphragm motor 8 . Furtheremore, there is shown an electric servomotor 13 for adjustment of the position of the float via the slide system 11 with an attached arm 10 . A relief valve 17 connected to the float arm, and thus to the slide system 11 , controls the air pressure on the diaphragm in the motor 8 by alternately increasing or reducing the pressure as a function of the inclination of the float arm. The float arm is also fitted with a diaphragm control valve 15 that closes up opens up, respectively, for the air jet on two pneumatic sensors used as alarms in case of adjustment system failure, e.g. by power failure, mechanical break down of the plug rod etc.The figure also shows the arm lever 6 , which via the attachment link not shown in the figure connects the plug rod 5 to the air diaphragm motor 8 . The adjustment device according to the invention works as follows. The diaphragm motor is spring loaded on one side of the diaphragm and air pressure loaded on the other side.Consequently, air pressure changes will move the diaphragm and thus the plug which closes the tap hole with reduced air pressure and vice versa,At the start of the casting the air side of the diaphragm receives 100 of a pre set air pressure. The plug opens fully, and the metal will flow into the float chamber 2 and gradually fill it. When the metal reaches the predetermined level 9 , the metal will raise the float 1 and, via the float arm 10 , it will actuate the relief valve 17 which gradually reduces the air pressure until the air pressure and the spring pressure on the diaphragm in the diaphragm motor reach a state of equilibrium. The plug rod 5 controlling the metal flow has now reached its correct position, the plug will be stable and the metal level will be constant under stable casting conditions.The float arm 10 will essentially be at a right angle to the vertical axis of the slide system. By changing the casting parameters, e.g. the casting speed, every slightest change in the metal level will bring about immediate correction of the tap hole opening such that the constant metal level in the float box will be maintained continuously. This is effected by adapting the position of the plug rod continuously by altering the pressure on the diaphragm in the diaphragm motor 8 which is in turn controlled by the relief valve in step with the movement of the float. Furthermore, the device according to the invention offers the possibility of adjusting the metal level in the float chamber, e.g. if it is desirable to use the metal level actively in an integrated strip casting control process in order to control the metal volume hydrostatic pressure on the nozzle. The relief valve connected to the float arm 10 , which is attached to the slide system 11 controlled by the servomotor 13 , allows raising lowering of the float and thus setting of a new metal level 9 in the float chamber and a new basic position of the relief valve at the same time.The servomotor, which may also be operated manually, is equipped for remote control with position indication, and it may be connected to the control system for an automated casting process.
