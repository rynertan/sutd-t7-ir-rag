# Daylight film loading method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A film package containing a stack of films in a lighttight envelope is held vertically in a lighttight loading chamber, and a lower end of the envelope is cut while at least the films are prevented from falling. A film receiving case is moved upwardly to the vicinity of the lower end of the film package, and the films are allowed to fall onto the case. The case is then moved down to completely separate the films from the lighttight envelope, and a shutter is closed between the envelope and the films to shield the films from light.
