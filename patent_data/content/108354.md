# A DATA PROCESSING APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR USE IN SPEECH RECOGNITION

## Abstract
A speech recognizer is disclosed which includes a number of processors 110, 130, 140, 150, 160 each having a shared memory 406 associated therewith. Each processor performs local processing tasks on data stored in the associated shared memory. The data stored is distributed by direct memory access during and without interfering with local processing of the remaining data stored in the shared memories. A plurality of circuits are connected to a shared data bus 412 for effecting the data transfer across the shared data bus. A remote controller 447 controls transfer of data across a remote bus 450 . A shared controller 440 includes synchronization circuitry 1100 for synchronizing shared data bus requests with the timing of the local processor, and priority circuitry 1000 to insure that the local processor always has access to the shared memory 406 through the shared data bus 412 without waiting. When used in continuous speech recognition, a front end processor 110 is employed for converting digital spectral speech data to frames of parametric data more suitable for further speech processing at last two template processors 130, 140, 150 are employed to store the recognizable vocabulary as templates and for comparing the frames of parametric data individually with the stored templates and a master proces sor 160 is employed to transfer new frames of parametric data to the template processors and to redistribute templates among the template processors for more efficient processing in response to analysis of the results of template compari sons.
