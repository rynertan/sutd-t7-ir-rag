## Description
POWER FACTOR CONTROLLERTHIS invention relates to a method and means of regulating the power factor in a consumer network.It is an object of the present invention to provide substantially automatic power factor regulation in an electrical network.According to the invention a method of regulating the power factor in an electrical network comprises the steps of providing a plurality of capacitive and or inductive reactive components, measuring the power factor in the network, determining the corrective reactance required to obtain a predetermined overall corrected power factor, and switching a reactance which equals or approximates such required reactance into the network. For practical purposes the switched reactance will almost invariably be capacitive.Further according to the invention the method includes the step of determining which reactive components, when summated will approximate the ideal corrective capacitance, and coupling such capacitive components into the network. It is envisaged that the power factor will be measured by known methods. For example the power factor could be measured by determining the time period between zero crossings of the voltage and current waves of the alternating current supply, and utilizing harmonic filtering to eliminate spurious interferances with measurements.Alternatively the suitable measurement and computation of real power kW and apparant power kVA could be used to determine the power factor.In a preferred arrangement according to the invention the determinations and calculations above will be made and controlled by a micro processor and the method includes the steps of entering the values and or corrective effects of the capacitive components in a suitable memory facility. Thus in operation the micro processor will have access to the characteristics of the capacitive components in order to sleablo it to s ct the most suitable combination of components for corrective purposes.It is envisaged that where a CapaciLivo component malfunctions it will be excluded from use, and a suitable indication and or alarm signal provided.Yet further according to the invention the method in one embodiment proposes that determination of the power factor and correction if necessary will be effected at predetermined time intervals. It will be appreciated that after an initial correction, additional corrections may comprise the substitution of one capacitive component for another, or the addition or removal of a capacitive component to or from the network. Alternatively, in order to reduce switching, additional corrective switching of capacitive components into or out of the network, after the initial correction may be effected only after the power demand of the system varies by a predetermined amount.Thus for example after the initial power factor correction sequence, additional capacitive components will be switched into the system only if the demand level rises by a further percentage, typically in the order of 50 fifty percentum to 70 seventy percentum of the demand during previous correction. The method also includes the step of summating the collective content of harmonics in the supply and activating an alarm, trip or the like when such sum exceeds a predetermined harmonic level.Further features of the method of the invention provide for indication and or alarm signals to be given for various malfunctions such as current input loss, excessively low current, incorrect polarity, voltage loss on a phase, incorrect phase rotation of voltage connections, a switching malfunction in respect of the capacitive components, and where an unacceptable power factor prevails for a predetermined time period.The invention is further directed to apparatus suitable for use in the method disclosed above comprising means for determining the power factor in an electrical network, means for determining the corrective capacitive or inductive reactance required to provide a predetermined corrected power factor, a plurality of reactive components, and switch means for switching any one or more of the reactive components into the network, in accordance with the corrective reactance required.The means for determining the power factor could be of a conventional type as described above.Further according to this aspect of the invention the means for determing the corrective capacitance required is a micro processor, with access to a memory which includes the values and or corrective effects of the respective capacitive components.Also according to the invention means is provided for summating the collective content of harmonics in the supply. When an excess above a predetermined harmonic level arises, an alarm and or trip functions will be activated.In order more clearly to illustrate the invention an embodiment thereof is described hereunder purely by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a power factor correction controller andFigure 2 is a representation of a display panel for the controller in Figure 1.In the diagrams the numbers identify the following compents Number Component 1.

Reference Inputs 34 Inhibit Control With reference to Figure 1 a controller adapted to switch a required combination of reactive components into a consumer network for purposes of regulating the power factor comprises a voltage input shown at R,S,T which is linked via a voltage conditioning circuit, a voltage filter 2 and rectifier 5 to a multiplex AD convertor 7. A current input K,L is likewise linked via a current conditioning circuit 27, a fundamental current filter 28, a harmonic filter 30, and fundamental and harmonic current converters 29 and 31 respectively to a convertor 7. A waveform sense circuit 6 provides phase signals to a central processor unit 8 enable the latter which is interfaced with the convertor 7, to determine the power factor in the network. The power factor is measured by determining the time period between the zero crossings of the voltage and current waves.The power factor will be displayed on a conventional seven segment LED display 12.It is a feature of the invention that the processor unit 8 will determine the value of the total capacitive or inductive reactance required to provide a predetermined power factor for the network. It is for example envisaged that a power factor of 0,98 will be set as the target power factor. In the circuit illustrated six capacitive components are provided and adapted to be switched by means of relays shown at 24 in any desired combination. LED s i to vi, Figure 2 will indicate which capacitive components are coupled in the network at any particular time. The values of the capacitive components as well as the individual corrective effect of each component will be stored in a ram memory 10 for the micro processor 8. The operating program of the processor 20 will be stored in a suitable Eprom memory shown at 9.The corrective effect of a capacitive component can be determined on installation of the controller by switching each capacitive component into the network and storing the result in the memory 10.In a preferred arrangement of the invention the central processor unit 8 will make an initial adjustment to the power factor in the network by selecting a combination of the capacitive components. Thereafter readjustment can be effected at predetermined time intervals, for example ten second periods, and it will be appreciated that the processor unit can either substitute capacitive components, add additional components to the network, or switch components out of the circuit. Alternatively in order to minimize switching, additional correction after the initial correction could be effected only once the system demand level rises over a predetermined level of that experienced during initial correction. For example the arrangement could be such that additional correction is not effected until the system demand level rises over say 70 seventy percentum of that during initial correction.Once the 708 seventy percentum level is reached switching will again occur freely to obtain the predetermined power factor.Further features of the invention provides for LED indicators 16 to 21 to indicate various system conditions and these are operated through an LED driver 13. In a preferred arrangement it is envisaged that these will indicate a cos 0 leading condition, a current input loss, a condition where the current is below a predetermined minimum operating level, where polarities are incorrect, where a voltage loss on a phase occurs, where phase rotation of a voltage is incorrect and an excessive harmonics condition. An audible alarm and light 23 could aleo be activated where any one or more of the above conditions occur, and in addition where for example there is failure of a capacitive component or where the power factor remains at an unacceptable level for a predetermined period etc.Further components of the controller in Figure 1 comprise a phase loss and reversal detector 4 which provides a signal on occurance to the microprocessor 20 for display on one of the LED S 16 to 21. An inhibit control is shown at 34. The other components in the schematic diagram comprise reference inputs 33 and an auto ranging circuit coupled to the convertor 7. A power supply unit is shown at 26.Further components, not shown, could comprise manual condition settings in the form ok rncernal pots, and manual overriding switches for the relays 24. The overriding switches could be provided externally on the display of the unit, and the operation of a switch will sequentially switch relays into the network while operation of the other switch will sequentially switch relays out of the network.Doubtless many variations of the invention exist which differ in matters of detail only but do not depart from the principles set out in the consistory clauses.
