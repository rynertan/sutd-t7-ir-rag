# Transparent container for electrostatic sensitive electronic components.

## Abstract
A container 10 for longitudinally receiving a plurality of electrostatic sensitive electronic components 12 having a rigid, transparent, elongated channel 14 being open on at least one end. The channel 14 has a transparent, insulative layer 22 and a transparent conductive layer 24 at least partially transversely surrounding the electrostatic sensitive electronic components 12 . Optionally, the interior surface of the channel 14 may contain an antistatic layer 27 . Further optionally, the exterior surface of the container may contain a transparent protective layer 26 .
