## Description
PHOTOGRAPHICALLY USEFUL CKALCOGENAZOLYLIDENE AND CijALCOGENAZOLIUM DYES AND METHODS AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THEIR PREPARATION This invention is directed to certain novel aromatic chalcogenazolylidene and and chalcogenazolium nucleus containing dyes and to methods and intermediates for their preparation. Dyes containing one or more aromatic chalcogenazolium nuclei, such as benzoxazolium, naphthoxazolium, benzothiazolium, naphthothiazolium, benzoselenazolium, and naphthoselenazolium nuclei, as well as their azole, azoline, and azolinium derivatives, have been widely employed in silver halide photography. Although U.S. Patents 2,168,174, 2,323,503, and 504 have extended generic ring formulae to include tellurazoles as extrapolations of investigations of other chalcogenazoles, the true state of the art is summed up by U.S. Patent 2,339,094 It may be observed that the difficulty of reaction resulting in the production of azoles containing members of the oxygen group of elements in the azole ring may vary greatly with different elements, becoming greater in proceed ing from the non metallic elements such as oxygen and sulfur to the more strongly metallic elements such as selenium and tellurium. This probably accounts for the fact that many of the oxazoles and thiazoles have been known for years while the preparation of most of the selenazoles has been accomplished more recently and some of them are still unknown although the corresponding oxazoles and thiazoles are known.Furthermore, the tellurazoles from the simplest to the more complex derivatives have not been described up to the present time. While the art has heretofore been unsuccessful in preparing tellurazolium and tellurazolylidene nuclei, it should be noted that divalent tellurium atoms have been placed in other ring structures.Benzisotellurazole l,2 is described in Un NouvelHeterocycle Tellure le Benzisotellurazole l,2 , byCampsteyn et al, Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry,Vol. 15, August 1978, pp. 745 748. Unfortunately no derivative of benzisotellurazole l,2 is disclosed.Without a 3 position substituent the ring structure is itself severely restricted as a possible dye.Further, in general isochalcogenazoles are less desirable and more infrequently suggested for use as photographic addendum than the corresponding chalcogenazoles, since the chalcogen to nitrogen bond in the ring is a potential source of instability. Tellurium atoms have been incorporated in ring structures other than azole or azine rings of various dyes. Japanese Kokai 136420, laid openNovember 25, 1976, discloses a l tellura 3,5 cyclohexanedione nucleus in a merocyanine sensitizing dye in a silver halide emulsion. U.S. Patent 4,329,284 discloses l,2 oxachalcogenol l ium salts, wherein the chalcogen can be tellurium or selenium, to be useful in photoconductive compositions. U.S. Patents 4,365,016 and 017 disclose tellurapyrylium dyes for use in photoconductive compositions. It is one object of this invention to provide a dye having novel properties containing at least one basic nucleus comprised of an aromatic ring and a fused chalcogenazolium ring. This object is achieved when the chalcogenazolium ring is a tellurazolium ring. It is also an object of this invention to provide a first process for preparing protonated tellurazolium salts useful in preparing the tellurazolium ring containing dyes of this invention, these salts being of the general formula EMI3.1 wherein G represents the atoms completing a fused aromatic nucleus, R is an optionally substituted hydrocarbon moiety, and X is an anion. The first process according to the invention for preparing a protonated tellurazolium salt satisfying the general formula I is characterized by reacting a starting material of the formulaEMI3.2 with a strong alkaline reducing agent, acylating with a compound of the formula 0 II Y C R , and III treating with a strong nonoxidizing acid, where in G, R, and Xl are as defined above, m is zero or 1, X is halogen or a pseudohalogen, Y is halogen or R C O O , Z is O or N R , and R is an aromatic nucleus. It is an additional object of this invention to provide a second process for preparing a protonated tellurazolium salt satisfying general formula I . The second process according to this invention for preparing a protonated tellurazolium salt satisfying general formula I is characterized by reacting a starting material of the formulaEMI4.1 with a strong alkaline reducing agent, and treating with a strong nonoxidizing acid, wherein G represents the atoms completing a fused aromatic nucleus, R represents an aliphatic or aromatic group comprised of a hydrocarbon moiety optionally linked through a divalent oxy, thio, or carbonyl linkage, an amino group, an amido group, a ureido group, a formamidine disulfide group, or a C O M group, wherein M is chosen to complete an acid, ester, thioester, or salt, X represents halogen or pseudohalogen, and X represents an anion. It is a further object of this invention to provide a processing for preparing a compound according to formula IV . This process is characterized by reactingEMI4.2 with TeX4 at an elevated temperature, wherein H is an activated hydrogen atom, G represents the atoms completing an aromatic nucleus, R represents an aliphatic or aromatic group comprised of a hydrocarbon moiety optionally linked through a divalent oxy, thio, or carbonyl linkage, an amino group, an amido group, a ureido group, a formamidine disulfide group, or a C O M group, wherein M is chosen to complete an acid, ester, thioester, or salt, and X represents chlorine or bromine atoms. It is a still further object of this invention to provide compounds containing an aromatic ring and, fused with the aromatic ring, a five or six membered ring containing a chalcogen atom, a nitrogen atom, and an oxygen atom bonded to the chalcogen atom and interposed between the chalcogen and nitrogen atoms characterized by the chalcogen atom being a tellurium atom. Tellurazolium or tellurazolylidene dyes have been long postulated, but sought without success.The present invention for the first time provides the art with such dyes as well as processes and intermediates for their preparation. These aromatic tellurazolium and tellurazolylidene ring structures are, quite unexpectedly, highly stable and therefore can be usefully employed as photographic dyes in place of corresponding nuclei containing other chalcogens, often with unexpectedly advantageous results. When in the form of polymethine dyes, particularly cyanine dyes, the dyes of this invention exhibit heretofore unrealized advantages. In polymethine sensitizing dyes electromagnetic radiation absorption maxima are shifted bathochromically as the number of methine linking groups is increased.Unfortunately, dye desensitization also tends to increase as a function of the number of methine linking groups. It is known that a bathochromic shift in absorption maxima of up to 5 nm per nucleus can be realized when a selenium atom is substituted for a sulfur atom in a chalcogenazolium dye nucleus.Thus, with a symmetrical simple cyanine dye a bathochromic shift of the absorption peak of up to 10 nm can be realized by substituting selenium for sulfur in both nuclei. It has now been discovered that the substitution of tellurium for sulfur in a chalcogenazolium dye nucleus is typically capable of producing a bathochromic shift in absorption of 25 nm or more.This can allow a reduction in the number of methine linking groups needed to achieve a selected absorption peak which reduces dye bulk and can reduce dye desensitization. For example, in a simple symmetrical cyanine dye the inclusion of two nuclei containing tellurium can result in a 50 nm or more bathochromic shift in the absorption maximum as compared to that of a corresponding dye containing sulfur in place of tellurium. Thus, although the compounds of this invention can take the form of dyes having absorption peaks ranging from the ultraviolet, through the blue, green, and red portions of the visible spectrum, and into the infrared, the dyes are increasingly attractive as the absorption maxima are shifted bathochromically.Preferred dyes according to this invention are therefore those capable of spectral sensitization in the minus blue greater than 500 nm portion of the visible spectrum and in the infrared portion of the spectrum. It has also been discovered that relatively high extinction coefficients are realized with the dyes of the present invention. This can be advantageous in allowing lower levels of dye to be employed to achieve a desired level of radiation absorption. When adsorbed to silver halide grain surfaces, the dyes of the present invention are useful not only as sensitizers, but also for altering native or intrinsic sensitivity. When not adsorbed to silver halide grain surfaces, the dyes of this invention can function in the emulsion and other layers of photographic elements as inter grain absorbing, antihalation, and filter dyes. Other, non photographic uses of these dyes are, of course, also possible. Dyes according to this invention contain as a nucleus an aromatic ring portion and, fused with the aromatic ring portion, a five membered ring containing a divalent tellurium atom, a nitrogen, and a carbon atom interposed between the tellurium and nitrogen atoms. Four possible divalent tellurium atom containing ring structures, depending upon ring unsaturation and bonding to the nitrogen atom are possible. These ring structures are tellurazole, tellurazoline including tellurazolinylidene when the interposed carbon atom is doubly bonded to a single substituent , and, when the nitrogen atom is protonated or quaternized, tellurazolinium and tellurazolium ring structures. The dyes of this invention contain a tellurazolium or tellurazolylidene nucleus. However, the other possible ring structures can be present in intermediates. The aromatic ring portion facilitates synthesis of the five membered ring portion with which it is fused. The five membered ring portion is highly stable and should by analogy to corresponding chalcogen containing heterocycles be highly stable, once formed, with or without a fused aromatic ring portion. Therefore, dyes lacking a fused aromatic ring portion should offer performance characteristics which are similar to those of the dyes of this invention. Procedures for synthesizing the dyes according to this invention satisfying the above general description, not having been previously known to the art, also constitute subject matter of the present invention. One useful synthetic route is to prepare a protonated tellurazolium salt, such as illustrated by general formula I above. The tellurazolium salt can be deprotonated by treatment with a base to form the corresponding tellurazole. The tellurazole can be converted to the corresponding tellurazoline by a conventional 2,3 addition reaction. A quaternizing agent can be employed to convert the tellurazole or tellurazoline to the corresponding quaternized tellurazolium or tellurazolinium salt.When the five membered tellurazolium ring is substituted at its 2 position i.e., at the interposed carbon atom , conventional procedures can be employed to prepare a polymethine dye containing a tellurazolium nucleus linked chromophorically through its 2 position. In such a polymethine dye the tellurazolium ring is recognized to constitute one resonance extreme while a tellurazolinylidene rlng constitutes another resonance extreme. Thus, it is apparent that the preparation procedures of the present invention are capable of producing dyes containing tellurazolium and tellurazolinylidene ring portions. The first process according to this invention for preparing a protonated tellurazolium salt satisfying formula I described above employs a starting material satisfying formula II . When m is zero and Z is N R , the starting material can be 2 phenylazophenyl C,N tellurium II chloride, the preparation of which is described by Cobbledick et al, Some New Organotellurium Compounds Derived fromAzobenzene The Crystal and Molecular Structure of 2 Phenylazophenyl C,N tellurium II Chloride ,Journal of Chemical Research, pp. 1901 1924, 1979.Although Cobbledick et al employed chloride as the halogen corresponding to X in formula II , it is apparent from the reported synthesis that X can be halogen employed here and elsewhere to deIgnate generically chloride, bromide, or iodide or a pseudohalogen i.e., one of the recognized class of substituents known to approximate the substituent properties of halogen , such as a cyano, thiocyanate, or hydroxy substituent. Similarly, G and R can be varied merely by substituting for one or both of the phenyl groups employed in the phenylazophenyl employed by Cobbledick et al an alternative aromatic nucleus.In general the aromatic nuclei, which form C in each of its various occurrences and are referred to in other occurrences variously as aromatic rings, nuclei, or aryl groups or moieties, are preferably carbocyclic aromatic nuclei having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, most preferably a phenyl or naphthyl or, in the fused form, a benzo or naphtho, nucleus.In some instances an aromatic nucleus can be fused through a five membered ring, as illustrated by acenaphthylene fused at its 1,2 ring edge. Since R has little influence on the reaction and is not incorporated in the final product, R can take a particularly wide variety of aromatic forms, but is generally most conveniently chosen from among the preferred forms of carbocyclic aromatic nuclei. In an alternative form the first process can employ a starting material according to formula 11 in which m is zero and Z is oxygen. This compound, which is a novel compound according to this invention, can be formed by placing in solution an optionally substituted a tetralone, hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, tellurium dioxide, and hydroxylamine. This reaction has the advantage that all of the required materials are readily available at relatively low cost. Alcohols are convenient solvents for the reaction, although other nonreactive organic solvents can be employed. Heating is not required, but can accelerate the reaction. The material of formula 11 forms a solid phase which can be separated by routine filtering and washing steps. Both unsubstituted a tetralone and various substituted derivatives are useful.Preferred a tetralones can be represented by the formula EMI10.1 wherein R2 and R3 are independently selected from among hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, and alkoxy. SinceR2 and R3 are naphtho ring substituents in the tellurazolium salt ultimately produced, it is apparent that the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl and alkoxy substituents can be widely varied.Instead of employing an a tetralone, as described above, it is possible to employ a substituted or unsubstituted acenaphthen l one. In general alkyl substituents and moieties of the tellurazolium salts and their derivatives are limited only by physical considerations, such as solubility, mobility, and molecular bulk. Generally alkyl and other aliphatic moieties of the tellurazolium salts and their derivatives of this invention are contemplated to contain up to 18 or more carbon atoms. Since increasing molecular bulk, except as sometimes required to reduce mobility, is seldom desirable in photographic applications, the preferred aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties contain up to 6 carbon atoms, with the lower alkyls i.e., methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl being preferred. In general, references to cycloalkyl indicate groups having 4 to 10 carbon atoms in a ring, with 5 or 6 ring carbon atoms being preferred. Instead of preparing the starting material of formula II wherein m is zero and Z is oxygen in the manner described above, an oxime of an a tetrlone or acenaphthen l one described above can be reacted with tellurium tetrahalide, preferably tellurium tetrachloride or tellurium tetrabromide.In this and subsequent descriptions of employing tellurium tetrahalides as reactants it should be borne in mind that similar results can usually be obtained by reacting before or during the a tetralone or acenaphthen l one reaction a soluble halide salt, such as an alkali or alkaline earth halide, with tellurium dioxide. This is believed to generate a tellurium tetrahalide. A carboxylic acid can be employed as a solvent for the reaction, and the reaction can be accelerated by heating. The starting material of formula 11 forms a solid phase which can be separated by routine filtering and washing procedures. The preferred a tetralone oximes correspond to the preferred a tetralones and can be represented by the formula R2 OH VII N R3 wherein R2 and R3 are chosen as described above. In a third general form of the starting material of formula II m can be 1 and Z oxygen.This form of the starting material of formula II , which also is a novel compound according to this invention, can be prepared by reacting with tellurium tetrahalide a carbocyclic aromatic compound activated for electrophilic substitution. Although naphthalene is illustrative of a fused ring carbocyclic aromatic compound that has been activated for electrophilic substitution, it is generally easiest to activate benzene. Activation can be achieved by employing electron donating substituents, such as hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, hydroxyaryl, amino, and groups of similar negative Hammett sigma values, singly or in combination.The reaction can be carrried out in an organic solvent such a liquid hydrocarbon e.g., benzene or cyclohexane , a halohydrocarbon e.g., chlorobenzene or chloroform , a nitrohydrocarbon e.g., nitromethane , or acetonit rile while heating to reflux. Formation of the starting material of formula II can be completed by nitrating and then treating with a reducing agent.Strong reducing agents can be employed in precisely stoichiometric concentrations. It is generally preferred to employ a mild or dilute reducing agent.Nitric acid in a suitable diluent, such as water or carboxylic acid, can be used for nitrating while hypophosphorous acid can be employed as the mild reducing agent. The synthetic route described above can be modified by a preliminary treatment with the mild reducing agent before nitrating and employing a strong nonoxidizing acid after nitrating and before employing the mild reducing agent a second time. In general the strong nonoxidizing acids contemplated for use in this and other steps of the preparation procedures herein described include acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, fluoroboric acid, a sulfonic acid, and phosphoric acid. A particularly preferred starting material, which constitutes a novel compound according to this invention, prepared by the process described in the preceding paragraph can be represented by the formula EMI12.1 wherein at least one of R1 and R2 and preferably both are chosen from among hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, hydroxyaryl, and amino groups. Alternatively R1 and R2 together can form an alkanediyldioxy linkage e.g., a O CH2 0 linkage, wherein n is preferably from 1 to 3. X is halogen or pseudohalogen, as previously described. Once the starting material of formula 11 has been prepared, regardless of the choice of alternative preparation routes described above, it is treated with a strong alkaline reducing agent, such as an alkali borohydride e.g., lithium, sodium, or potassium borohydride . The reaction product is then acylated with a compound according to formula III .From the values of Y identified above, it is apparent that the acylating agent can be either acyl halide, such as acetyl chloride or acetyl bromide, or an acid anhydride, such as acetic anhydride. By noting the appearance of R in formulas I and III it is also apparent that the acyl halide or acid anhydride also provides the 2 position substituent in the protonated tellurazolium salt formed as an ultimate product. The R group serves the important purpose of providing a favored reaction site on the tellurazolium ring of the salt ultimately produced. Generally this function is adequately served when R is a methyl group, but a wide variety of alternatives can be generated readily, if desired. When the acylating agent is acetyl halide or acetic anhydride, the 2 position substituent is methyl. By varying the acyl halide or acid anhydride employed, the 2 position substituent of the tellurazolium salt can take the form of various hydrocarbon moieties, such as alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkaryl, aryl, aralkyl, and various substituted derivatives, such as those containing alkoxy, alkylthio, halo, amino, amido, and similar substituents. Though not isolated, it is believed that acylation according to this invention produces tellurazolines. The additional step of producing the stable corresponding protonated tellurazolium salt is undertaken by treatment with a strong nonoxidizing acid, such as any of those mentioned above. Another process for preparing a protonated tellurazolium salt according to formula I comprises employing a starting material according to formula IV , which additionally constitutes a novel compound according to this invention. X is formula IV can be halogen or pseudohalogen, as previously described.R in the starting material of formula IV and the protonated tellurazolium salt prepared satisfying formula I can include an aliphatic or aromatic group comprised of a hydrocarbon moiety e.g., alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl moiety optionally linked through a divalent oxy, thio, or carbonyl linkage e.g., an alkoxy, aryloxy, alkaryloxy, aralkyloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkarylthio, aralkylthio, or acyl moiety an amino group, including primary, secondary and tertiary amines an amido group e.g., acetamido and butryamido a ureido group e.g., l ureido, 3 phenyl 1 ureido, and 3 methyl l ureido a formamidine disulfide group e.g., formamidine disulfide and N ethyl N3 methyl a1 dithiobisformamidine groups or a C O M group, wherein M is chosen to complete an acid, ester, thioester, or salt e.g., C O OH, C O OCH3, C O SCH3, or C O ONa . When M completes an ester or thioester, the esterifying moiety can take any of the hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon form s previously described by reference to R. When R is a primary amino group, it is in fact in one tautomeric form an imino group, which provides a highly convenient starting material for the synthesis of azacyanine dyes. The starting material according to formula IV is reacted with a strong alkaline reducing agent, such as described above, and the resulting product is reacted with a strong nonoxidizing acid, such as also described above, to produce the desired protonated tellurazolium salt. By suitable treatment, e.g., reduction or hydrolysis , the formamidine disulfide can, if desired, be converted to a thioureido group once the protonated tellurazolium salt has been formed. The structure of formamidine disulfide is described in International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, Nomenclature of OrganicChemistry, Buttersworth, London, 1965, Section 951.5. Both the starting material of formula IV and the process for its preparation form a part of the present invention.When the compound of formula V is melted or heated in a suitable solvent e.g., acetonitrile, butyronitrile, or chloroform with tellurium tetrachloride or tellurium tetrabromide, the material of formula IV is produced. Heating to a temperature of at least 600C up to about 1400C is contemplated, with temperatures of from about 110 to 1200C being preferred. In part the reaction to produce the material of formula IV is accomplished by choosing G in formula V so that the aromatic nucleus which it completes is activated in the position ortho to the amido substituent. This can be accomplished by including in the aromatic nucleus one or more substituents capable of directing ring substitution in formula V to the ring position of the starred activated hydrogen atom.For carbocyclic aromatic rings, such as benzene and naphthene rings, useful substituents can be chosen from among aliphatic and aromatic groups comprised of hydrocarbon moieties e.g., alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or alkaryl optionally linked through a divalent oxygen or sulfur atom e.g., an alkoxy, aryloxy, alkaryloxy, alkaryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkarylthio, or alkarylthio group an amino group, including primary, secondary and tertiary amines an amido group e.g., acetamido and butyramido a sulfonamido group e.g. an alkyl or arylsulfonamido group a sulfamoyl group e.g. an alkyl or arylsulfamoyl group a ureido group e.g., l ureido, 3 phenyl lureido, and 3 methyl l ureido a thioureido group e.g., a thioureido group corresponding to the above exemplary ureido groups hydroxy or a C O M group or S O 2M, wherein M is chosen to complete an acid, ester, thioester, or salt, as previously defined. The aromatic nucleus completed by G as well as R can progress unaltered from the compound of formula V to the protonated tellurazolium salt forming the protonated tellurazolium salt. The anion X shown associated with the protonated tellurazolium salt in formula I is usually the anion of the last acid employed in the process. However, it is apparent that conversion from one anion to another can be easily accomplished and that the anion of the tetrazolium salts can be varied widely. To obtain the tellurazole corresponding to the protonated tellurazolium salt prepared as described above treatment with a base, such as ammonium hydroxide, an alkali hydroxide, or an alkali carbonate or bicarbonate, can be undertaken. Procedures for performing the same operation on known chalcogenazolium salts are directly applicable. The tellurazole product obtained is generally indicated by the formulaEMI16.1 wherein G and R correspond to their values in the parent protonated tellurazolium salt. To convert the tellurazole of formula IX to a corresponding quaternized heterocyclic ammonium salt, as indicated by the formulaEMI17.1 the tellurazole of formula IX is reacted with a quaternizing agent. In a preferred form the quaternizing agent is a sulfonic acid ester containing the quaternizing radical R5 as the base derived moiety of the ester. Specifically preferred quaternizing agents are strong quaternizing agents, such as poly fluoro alkylsulfonic acid esters, such as aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, or alkaryl esters of poly fluoro alkvlsulfonic acid.Perfluorinated alkylsulfonic acid esters are particularly preferred quaternizing agents e.g., trifluoromethylsulfonic acid esters . Arylsulfonic acid esters, such as para toluenesulfonic acid esters, are also strong quaternizing agents. 1,3,2 Dioxathiane 2,2 dioxide and l,3,2 dioxathiolane 2,2 dioxide have also been demonstrated to be useful quaternizing agents. Including electron donating ring substituents in the aromatic nuclei forming G in formula IX facilitates quaternization while strongly electron withdrawing substituents require strong quaternizing agents to be employed when quaternization occurs after tellurazole ring formation. A very advantageous approach for preparing quaternized tellurazolium salts according to formula X is to employ a starting material according to formula II wherein m is zero, indicated specifically by the formula EMI18.1 wherein G represtns the atoms completing a fused aromatic nucleus, X is chloride, bromide, or iodide, Z is O or N R , and R is an aromatic nucleus.The starting material is first treated with a strong alkaline reducing agent, which can be selected from among those described above. The reaction product is then treated with an oxidizing agent, such as oxygen, a peroxide, a disulfide, or a sulfoxide, then treated with an aldehyde, treated with a reducing agent, such as described above, and then treated with an acylating agent according to formula III , as described above, and a strong nonoxidizing acid, also as described above. Although treatment with an oxidizing agent is preferred, no separate oxidizing step is required. Ambient air will spontaneously perform such oxidation, and treatment with the aldehyde is sufficient in an inert atmosphere.A variety of quaternizing substituents can be introduced in the salt of formula VIII in addition to those provided by strong quaternizing agents, merely by appropriate selection of the aldehyde. Thus, R5 in formula VIII can take the form of an optionally substituted hydrocarbon residue of an aldehyde quaternizing substituent, such as alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or aralkyl moieties as well as substituted derivatives, such as oxy, thio, sulfo, sulfonyl, sulfato, halo, or carboxy substituted derivatives, often incorporated to modify solubility or other physical properties.Sulfoalkyl and sulfatoalkyl quaternizing substituents having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms are specifically preferred. In the foregoing discussion the novel compounds of formulae II , IV , VIII , and XI have been described in terms of their utility as starting materials for the preparation of tellurium, nitrogen, and carbon containing ring structures. It should be recognized, however, that these formulae represent specific illustrations of a novel class of cyclic compounds containing tellurium, nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen in the ring structures. The cyclic compounds of this class according to the present invention can be characterized as containing an aromatic ring and, fused with the aromatic ring, a five or six membered ring containing a tellurium atom, a nitrogen atom, and an oxygen atom bonded to the tellurium atom and interposed between the tellurium and nitrogen atoms.From the formulae, it is apparent that the tellurium atom is preferably in either a tetravalent or hexavalent form, and the nitrogen atom is in either a trivalent or pentavalent form. In a form in which the heterocyclic tellurium containing ring is a five membered ring and the ring nitrogen atom is trivalent, these novel compounds can take the form of 1,2,5 oxatellurazoles which contain an aromatic ring. Specific examples of such compounds are substituted and unsubstituted 2,1,3 benzoxatellurazoles and naphth 2,1 c 1,2,5 oxatellurazoles. When the nitrogen atom is in a pentavalent form, the compounds can take the form of corresponding N oxides e.g., substituted and unsubstituted 2,1,3 benzoxatellurazole N oxides and naphth 2,l c l,2,5 oxatellurazole N oxides. In a form in which the heterocyclic tellurium containing ring is a six membered ring, these novel compounds can take the form of 1,2,5 oxatellur azinium salts which contain a fused aromatic ring.Specific examples of such compounds are substituted and unsubstituted 2,1,4 benzoxatellurazinium and naphth 2,1 c 1,2,5 oxatellurazinium salts. The ring substituents described in connection with formulae 11 , V , IX , and XII are those preferred for the applications in which these compounds are employed as starting materials in the syntheses described. However, it is apparent that ring substituents can be chosen from among those known for chalcogenazole and chalcogenazolium nuclei to satisfy other specific applications. For example, electron withdrawing substituents other than halogen and pseudohalogen can be present. In addition to being useful intermediates for the syntheses described above, the compounds of this invention containing tellurium, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms in a five or six membered ring can be applied to uses as ultraviolet and visible electromagnetic radiation absorbers. From the foregoing discussion of synthetic discoveries it is apparent that this invention is in general capable of providing tellurium analogues of the chalcogenazolium salts and their chalcogenazole, chalcogenazoline, and chalcogenazolinium derivatives heretofore known to be useful, particularly those known to be useful in the photographic art. Of particular importance to the preparation of photographically useful polymethine dyes is the capability of the processes of this invention to produce compounds substituted in the 2 and 3 positions that is, the 2 position ring carbon atom and the nitrogen atom of the divalent tellurium containing ring. A 2 position substituent is essential to providing a favored reaction site on the tellurium containing ring.Contemplated 2 position substituents can be linked to the interposed carbon atom by a single or double carbon to carbon, carbon to nitrogen, or carbon to chalcogen bond. Carbon to carbon double and single bonding is highly useful in forming polymethine dyes containing a methine linkage in the 2 position. Carbon to nitrogen single and double bonds are useful in the 2 position are useful in preparing azacyanine polymethine dyes and in preparing azo dyes incorporating the tellurium containing ring as a portion of the chromophore. Chalcogen single and double bonds in the 2 position provide conveniently addressed reaction sites. Once formed, the tellurazolium salts of this invention and their tellurazole, tellurazoline, and tellurazolinium derivatives were discovered to form unexpectedly stable heterocyclic nuclei which can thereafter be synthetically modified by synthetic procedures generally applicable to known chalcogen analogues. These procedures, which are well known in the art, are adequately illustrated by the examples. While the tellurazolium and tellurazolylidene nucleus containing dyes of this invention can be applied to a variety of known applications for corresponding dyes incorporating a differing divalent chalcogen atom, these dyes are particularly suited to photographic uses, particularly uses in silver halide photography. In a specifically contemplated photographically useful form a dye according to the present invention contains at least one basic nucleus comprised of an aromatic ring and a fused tellurazolium ring. The tellurazolium ring preferably forms a part of the chromophore so that it is in the form of a tellurazolium ring in one resonance extreme and rearranges to a tellurazolylidene ring in a second resonance extreme. When the protonated tellurazolium salts are as described above with R being amine, a corresponding diazo dye can be generated including the novel ring structure of this invention as a part of the dye chromophore. In a specifically preferred form the dyes of this invention are polymethine dyes. Such dyes include cyanine and merocyanine dyes. The dyes can contain two nuclei joined through a methine linkage, which is the most common occurrence. These dyes are sometimes referred to as simple cyanines or merocyanines to distinguish them from those containing three or more nuclei, referred to as complex cyanine or merocyanine dyes. In addition to the above, the polymethine dyes of this invention can take the form of hemicyanine, styryl, neocyanine, azacyanine, and allopolarcyanine dyes. Such dyes according to the invention are direct analogues of conventional dyes in these classes, the difference being the presence of a divalent tellurium atom in at least one chalcogenazolium nucleus in place of another divalent chalcogen. The following formula can be employed to describe polymethine dyes according to this invention EMI22.1 where in G represents the atoms completing a fused aromatic nucleus R5 represents a quaternizing substituent X1 represents a counterion z is zero or a positive integer chosen to balance ionic change and L represents the atoms necessary to complete a polymethine dye. In a specifically preferred form the dyes according to the present invention are cyanine dyes.These dyes can be symmetrical, thereby including at least two identical tellurazolium nuclei according to this invention or asymmetrical, in which instance the nuclei can each be different tellurazolium nuclei according to this invention or can be a combination of at least one tellurazolium nucleus according to this invention together with one or more conventional basic heterocyclic cyanine dye nuclei. The nuclei are joined through a methine linkage, which can consist of a single methine group or a chain of methine groups. As discussed above, since the tellurazolium ring is capable of producing a bathochromic absorption shift, a lesser number of methine groups can be employed to achieve absorption of longer wavelength electromagnetic radiation however, methine linkages of up to 13 or more successive methine groups can be incorporated in the dyes, if desired. One preferred class of cyanine dyes according to this invention can be represented by the following formula EMI23.1 wherein G represents the atoms completing a fused aromatic nucleus Ll L2 L3 L4, and Ls each independently represent a methine group n represents zero, 1, or 2 p represents zero or 1 Q represents the atoms completing a basic azolinylidene or azinylidene heterocyclic nucleus R5 and R6 each independently represent a quaternizing substituent X1 represents a counterion, and z is zero or a positive integer chosen to balance ionic charge. From the foregoing formula it is apparent that the cyanine dye is a species of the quaternized tellurazolium salt of formula X wherein the 2 position substituent R has been further elaborated. The tellurazolium nucleus has already been discussed above. Although this nucleus could be characterized as either a tellurazolium or tellurazolinylidene nucleus, for convenience the former nucleus designation is employed while for consistency the remaining nucleus is referred to as an azolinylidene or azinylidene nucleus. Generally any conventional azolinylidene or azinylidene nucleus satisfying formula XIII can be employed in combination with the tellurazolium nucleus. It is specifically contemplated that Q can be chosen from among benzotellurazolinylidene, naphthotellurazolinylidene, 2 or 4 pyridylidene, imidazopyridylidene, 2 or 4 quinolinylidene, 1 or 3 isoquinolinylidene, benzoquinolinylidene, thiazoloquinolylidene, imidazoquinolylidene, 3H indolylidene, 1H or 3H benzindolylidene, oxazolinylidene, oxazolidinylidene, benzoxazolinylidene, naphthoxazolinylidene, oxadiazolinylidene, thiazolidinylidene, phenan throthiazolinylidene, acenaphthothiazolinylidene, thiazolinylidene, benzothiazolinylidene, naphthothia zolinylidene, tetrahydrobenzothiazolinylidene, dihydronaphthothiazolinylidene, thiadioxazolinylidene, selenazolidinylidene, selenazolinylidene, benzoselenazolinylidene, naphthoselenazolinylidene, selenadiazolinylidene, pyrazolylidene, imidazolinylidene, imidazolidinylidene, benzimidazolinylidene, naphthimidazolinylidene, diazolinylidene, tetrazolinylidene, and imidazoquinoxalinylidene nuclei.The nuclei can be substituted in any conventional manner consistent with formula XIII . R6 can, for example, be any conventional quaternizing group and can be chosen from among any of the various forms of RS described above. In a specifically preferred form the cyanine dyes of this invention satisfying formula XIII are cyanine dyes of the formulaEMI25.1 wherein G completes a fused benzo or naphtho nucleus n is zero, 1, or 2 R5 and R6 are independently alkyl radicals which are optionally sulfo substituted Q represents the atoms completing a basic azolinylidene or azinylidene nucleus optionally including a fused benzo or naptho ring portion Xl is a counterion and z is zero or a positive integer chosen to balance ionic charge. In certain optimum forms R5 and R6 are sulfo or sulfato substituted hydrocarbon e.g., alkyl or aryl substituents containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as sulfomethyl, sulfatomethyl, sulfoethyl, sulfatoethyl, sulfopropyl, sulfatopropyl, sulfobutyl, sulfatobutyl, sulfophenyl, or sulfatophenyl substituents. Further, the benzo or naphtho nucleus completed by G can include one or a combination of alkyl, alkoxy, thioalkyl, and hydroxy substituents. In another preferred form the cyanine dyes employed in the photographic elements of this invention can be represented by the formulaEMI26.1 wherein G represents the atoms completing a fused aromatic nucleus L1 L2 L3, L4, and Ls each independently represent a methine group n represents zero, 1, or 2 p represents zero or 1 Q represents the atoms completing a basic heterocyclic azolinylidene or azinylidene nucleus R5 and R6 each independently represent a quaternizing substituent Xl represents a counterion, and z is zero or a positive integer chosen to balance ionic charge. Except for the form of the azolinylidene or azinylidene ring completed by Q, the various components of formula XV can be selected similarly as described above with respect to formula XIII and are not again discussed. In optimum forms Q in formula XV is selected from among pyrrolylidene, indolylidene, carbazolylidene, benzindolylidene, pyrazolylidene, indazolylidene, and pyrrolopyridinylidene nuclei. Again, conventional ring substituents consistent with formula XV are contemplated. Rs and R6 are optimally sulfo or sulfato substituted hydrocarbon substituents, as described above. Preferred merocyanine dyes according to this invention are those of the formulaEMI27.1 where in E represents an acidic nucleus G represents the atoms completing a fused aromatic nucleus 1.1 and L2each independently represent a methine linkage n represents zero, 1, or 2 and R5 represents a quaternizing substituent. From formula XVI it is apparent that, except for the acidic nucleus E, the portions consti tuting the preferred merocyanine dyes can be selected from among corresponding components constituting the cyanine dyes. Accordingly, these corresponding components of the merocyanine dyes are not redescribed. The acidic nucleus E can take the form of any conventional merocyanine acid nucleus. TypicallyE is in one resonance extreme comprised of a methylene moiety bonded to a carbonyl, sulfo, or cyano group directly or through a methine linkage.Unlike the nuclei of the cyanine dyes, the acidic nucleus E need not be heterocyclic or even cyclic. In a preferred form E can be represented by the formulaEMI28.1 wherein D is a cyano, sulfo, or carbonyl group, D is a methine substituent, which in one form can with D complete a five or six membered heterocyclic ring containing ring atoms chosen from the class consisting of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. When E is an acyclic group that is, when D and D are independent groups, E can be chosen from among groups such as malononitrile, alkylsulfonylacetonitrile, cyanomethyl benzofuranyl ketone, or cyanomethyl phenyl ketone. In preferred cyclic forms of E, D, and D together complete a 2 pyrazolin 5one, pyrazolidene 3,5 dione, iniidazoline 5 one, hydantoin, 2 or 4 thiohydantoin, 2 iminooxazoline 4one, 2 oxazoline 5 one, 2 thiooxazolidine 2,4 dione, isoxazoline 5 one, 2 thiazoline 4 one, thiazolidine4 one, thiazolidine 2,4 dione, rhodanine, thiazolidine 2,4 dithione, isorhodanine, indane l,3 dione, thiophene 3 one, thiophene 3 l ,l dioxide, indoline2 one, indoline 3 one, indazoline 3 one, 2 oxoindazolinium, 3 oxoindazolinium, 5,7 dioxo 6,7 dihydrothiazolo 3,2 a pyrimidine, cyclohexane 1,3 dione, 3,4 dihydroisoquinoline 4 one, l,3 dioxane 4,6 dione, barbituric acid, 2 thiobarbituric acid, chroman 2,4dione, indazoline 2 one, or pyrido l,2 a pyrimi dine l,3 dione nucleus. Conventional substituents of the rings are contemplated. The dyes according to this invention can be applied to any application where otherwise corresponding dyes containing another chalcogen atom are employed. The dyes of this invention are in a preferred application incorporated into silver halide photographic elements. The location and concentra tion of the dye is dictated by the photographically useful function sought to be realized. The dyes can be located behind one or more silver halide emulsion layers as imagewise exposed to absorb actinic radiation penetrating the silver halide emulsion layer or layers, thereby reducing scattered radiation. In other words, the dyes can be employed as antihalation dyes. They can be incorporated in interlayers or in overcoats to function as filter dyes. The dyes are preferably incorporated directly in the silver halide emulsion.The dyes can increase photographic sharpness by intercepting and absorbing actinic radiation that would otherwise be reflected between grains. In other words, the dyes can take the form of intergrain absorbers. A highly preferred utility for the dyes is to increase the wavelength of spectral response of silver halide grains to exposing radiation. In such an application the dyes are typically adsorbed to the surfaces of the silver halide grains. In addition the dyes can also serve the function of reducing the sensitivity of the silver halide grains in the spectral region of intrinsic or native sensitivity.This can be a desirable feature apart from spectral sensitization or can be a desirable feature in combination with spectral sensitization to increase the difference between sensitized and intrinsic speeds of the emulsions, as is desired for minus blue recording emulsions in color photography. It is specifically contemplated to employ the dyes of the present invention as spectral sensitizers in both surface and internal latent image forming emulsions.The latter emulsions offer the advantage of permitting more favorable dye concentration desensitization relationships i.e., more dye is required to reach desensitization levels. When the dyes of the present invention are employed in combination with surface fogged silver halide emulsions intended for use in forming direct positive images, their substituents can be chosen to enhance electron trapping. As discussed above, ultraviolet, blue, green, red, and infrared absorbing dyes according to this invention are contemplated however, dyes having absorption peaks at 500 nm and longer wavelengths are particularly advantageous.ExamplesA. Preparation of 2 Phenylazophenyltellurium TrichlorideEMI30.1 C1 2H9Cl3N2Te mw 415.18 A two liter, 3 necked flask was fitted with mechanical stirrer Teflon blade , reflux condenser and nitrogen inlet. A gas outlet from the top of the condenser was connected to a gas bubbler dipping into a magnetically stirred 1000 ml beaker containing 200 ml distilled water and a little phenolphthalein indicator. The system was sufficiently gas tight so that a very gentle stream of nitrogen produced consistent bubbles in the indicator solution. Into the flask were placed 100 g 0.55 mole azobenzene, 134 g 0.5 mole tellurium tetrachloride, and 66 g 0.5 mole anhydrous aluminum chloride. l,2 Dichlorobenzene 500 ml was added, the apparatus closed, the nitrogen flow started, and the mixture stirred until an orange brown solution was obtained. Five ml of 1N sodium hydroxide were then added to the indicator solution, and the flask contents were heated to reflux with brisk stirring. The start of the reaction was marked by loss of the indicator color. Measured volume increments of 1N sodium hydroxide were then added to the beaker each time the indicator color discharged. Incremental volume and elapsed time of addition are tabulated below Time Vol. in NaOH Minutes ml 0 5 6.5 50 13.0 100 20.0 150 28.0 200 36.5 250 46.0 300 54.0 350 70.0 400 85.0 450 94.0 475Boiling under reflux was continued until 475 ml 1N sodium hydroxide had been consumed. The flask contents were then permitted to cool to about 80 C. Methyl alcohol was then added very slowly to the rapidly stirred solution until the initial vigorous reaction ceased. A total of 500 ml methanol was then added and the mixture cooled in ice for more than one hour. The heavy granular crystalline precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with methanol until the methanol filtrate was pale yellow. The light brown glittering crystals were dried in vacuum. A yield of 130.3 g 63 of theory , m.p. 261 2630C was obtained. The product contained small amounts of oxides that were removed by recrystallization from 1 ,2 dichlorobenzene.

To the rapidly stirred solution was added, at room temperature, 50 aqueous hypophosphorous acid 30 ml, 0.3 mole as rapidly as possible. There was a brief appearance of a brown solution color, before the entire solution set to a mass of black fibrous crystals. The product was collected after 15 minutes by filtration using rubber dam to compact the highly solvated crystal mass.

The mixture turned black immediately, indicating that considerable quantities of tellurium had been generated. The black mixture was stirred for another 30 minutes, then filtered to collect the precipitate.The solid was washed briefly with dichloromethane and air dried.

Through the condenser was added sodium borohydride until further addition no longer produced a transient orange color. This required about 3.0 g. The mixture was stirred for a few minutes under nitrogen, then concentrated hydrochloric acid 100 ml was added in one portion.The mixture was clarified by filtration with Elite, then evaporated under reduced pressure to 200 ml, again filtered from inorganic salts and chilled overnight. Filtration yielded 9.15 g of colorless solid, which was rinsed with isopropanol and air dried. The material was not pure and contained inorganic salt contaminants.

Sodium hydroxide 8.0 g o 0.2 mole in water 30 ml was added, followed by sodium borohydride 8.56 g 0.225 mole until the reduction mixture was a pale brown.This required heating to aid in dissolving the starting material and the initial reduction products. When the reduction was complete, the mixture was cooled to about 100C, and concentrated hydrochloric acid 100 ml was added in one portion. There was a granular black precipitate, which was removed by filtration. The filtrate was evaporated in vacuum to 250 ml, diluted with water to twice the volume, and stirred until crystallization was complete. A yield of 29.5 g, 94.8 of theory, was obtained.

The material did not completely dissolve. Sodium borohydride was added in portions with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere.The starting material underwent vivid color changes to orange and then to blue with the addition of each portion of reducing agent. The mass became difficult to stir. Eventually, the reaction mixture became more liquid, though the orange color kept returning after each portion was added, as the rather insoluble starting material underwent the first reduction step. The reaction mixture was kept overnight under an atmosphere of nitrogen. The reduction was continued the next day by heating the mixture to near reflux temperature while sodium borohydride was being added.When the stage was reached where the reaction turned colorless after a portion was added and the orange color did not return upon further stirring after the addition of 6.65 g 0.175 mole sodium borohydride , the mixture was cooled to l00C and concentrated hydrochloric acid 50 ml 0.5 mole was added in one portion.

The mixture was stirred for about 10 minutes at room temperature. A black precipitate, which formed during the acid addition, was removed by filtration, washed with ethanol, and discarded, leaving a yellow filtrate. The yellow filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure with a bath temperature of about 45 0C. When the volume was about 75 ml, the liquid was diluted with water to about 200 ml. The warm solution was clarified by filtration over Elite diatomaceous earth and then chilled in ice for two hours. A fluffy, crystalline solid 10.5 g was collected by filtration.

The reaction time was 24 hours. The dye was recrystallized twice from isopropanol to yield a sample that was pure according to the thin layer chromatograms and an ionogram. The three dyes of Examples 96 through 98 were observed to be easily converted in solution in the presence of base such as triethylamine to a merocyanine by the loss of hydrogen trifluoromethanesulfonate. In the next three examples the dyes were isolated in the merocyanine form. The conversion to merocyanine of all six hydroxy styryl dyes ofExamples 96 through 101 is easily and completely reversible by the addition of acid to the solutions of the dyes.EMI91.1 Example 99 2,6 Di tert butyl 4 2 5 methoxy 3 methylbenzotellurazolinylidene ethyl idene 2,5 cyclohexadien 1 one, R1 OCH3 C2 5H3 1NO2Te mw 504.76 This dye was prepared in the same way as that of Example 98, except that S methoxy 2,3 di methylbenzotellurazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate Example 32 was used in place of 2,3 dimethylbenzotellurazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate, up to the point where the crude product was redissolved in isopropanol.

Samples of the coatings were exposed to a tungsten light source in an Eastman 1B sensitometer through a wedge spectrograph. The coatings were developed for five minutes in a hydro quinone Elone N methylaminophenol hemisulfate developer, fixed, washed, and dried. Additional samples of each of the coatings were incubated for two weeks at 490C under 50 relative humidity before being exposed and processed as described above. A characteristic curve was plotted for each coating.The sensitivity and fog D min data were determined from these curves and are presented in Table II.

The dyes were added to separate portions of the emulsions at the concentrations indicated, and the resulting mixtures were coated to obtain silver coverage of 1.07 g m2 and a gelatin coverage of 7.32 g m2 on a cellulose ester support. A portion of each coating was exposed in a spectral sensitometer to a quartzhalogen light source through a Written 80B color correcting filter, diffraction grating with filters to remove second order transmission, and through a superimposed step wedge.The coatings were developed in a Kodak X omate processor for 80 sec at 350C in a Kodak Rapids X ray developer, fixed, washed, and dried. A characteristic D log E curve was determined for each coating at 400 nm and at each 10 nm interval between 400 nm and 700 nm. The speed at 0.3 density units above fog was read from each characteristic curve, adjusted for a uniform energy distribution over the spectral range, and plotted against wavelength to obtain a relative log spectral sensitivity curve. The sensitizing maximm and the relative speed at the sensitizing maximum for each dye was determined from this curve. The results of these tests are summarized inTable IV. The levels are expressed as moles of dye per mole of silver x 104. For example, the dye of Example 69 was present at 0.0008 mole mole Ag,. Sensitivity maxima and ranges are expressed in nanometers.

R1 R2 Rll R12 w OCH3 The emulsion used in these examples was a 0.25 pm cubic internal latent image forming silver bromide core shell emulsion in which the core was sulfur and gold sensitized and the surface was unsensitized.The dyes were added to separate portions of the emulsion at the levels indicated inTables VI and VII. Each portion was divided so that one also contained an addenda package of composition below and one did not. The amount of each component in the addenda package is expressed in grams mole Ag.

A portion of each coating was exposed in a spectral sensitometer, to a tungsten light source in both the visible and infrared region through a diffraction grating, with filters to remove second order transmission, and a continuous step wedge. Another portion was exposed to a tungsten lamp at 30000K through a Wrattens 87 filter which combination transmits radiation at wavelengths of 735 nm or longer . Still another portion was exposed to the 365 nm mercury emission line using a mercury lamp and a Written 18A filter. The coatings were developed twelve minutes in Kodak Rapid X rays developer which also contained in addition potassium iodide at room temperature, fixed, washed, and dried. Table VI contains a summary of the relative intrinsic sensitivities from the 365 nm line exposures and the relative infrared sensitivities from the 30000K Written 87 exposure . Results in Table VII demonstrate that all three dyes spectrally sensitize. The photographic response in coatings containing the addenda was better than in coatings without the addenda.
