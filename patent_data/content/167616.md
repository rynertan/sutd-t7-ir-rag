## Description
The ability to detect and diagnose cancer through the identification of tumor markers is an area of widespread interest. Tumor markers are substances, typically proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, and the like, which are produced by tumor cells and characteristic thereof. Often, a tumor marker is produced by normal cells as well as tumor cells. In the tumor cell, however, the production is in some way atypical. For example, production of the tumor marker may be greatly increased in the cancer cell. Alternatively, proteins and other substances normally present within or on the surface of normal cells may be released or shed into circulation when the cell becomes malignant. Detection of such secreted substances in serum may thus be diagnostic of the malignancy. Another problem encountered in cancer diagnosis relates to identifying the cellular origin of both primary and metastatic tumors. With both types of tumors, it is sometimes difficult to morphologically distinguish among tumors of differing cellular origins, e.g., tumors of epithelial origin carcinomas , tumors originating in the non epithelial connective tissue sarcomas , and lymphoid tumors lymphomas . Moreover, with breast epithelial cancers, it is often difficult to distinguish among tumors originating in ductal epithelial tissues, secretory epithelial tissues, and myoepithelial tissues. Therefore, it is desirable to identify previously unrecognized tumor markers, particularly tumor markers which are secreted into circulation and which may be identified by serum assays. It is also desirable to develop methods and compositions which allow determination of the cellular origin of a particular tumor. In the prior art, a 52,000 dalton protein released by certain breast cell lines in response to estradiol stimulation has been identified. See, Westley and Rochefort 1980 Cell 20 353 3362, and Veith et al. 1983 Cancer Res. 43 1861 1868. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the MCF 7 human breast cancer cell line have been shown to identify a 24 kilodalton cytosol protein. Ciocca et al. 1982 Cancer Res. 42 4256 4258. A protein referred to as tissue polypeptide antigen TPA is related to cytoplasmic intermediate filaments of epithelial cells. TPA is reported to be a tumor marker, both in serum and as a cell surface marker. See, Altmannsberger et al. 1981 Virchows Arch.

Sangtec Medical, Bromma, Sweden, sells a kit for the detection of TPA in serum and plasma under the tradename Prolifigren RIA kit. Mariresse et al. 1981 J. Steroid Biochem. 15 375 381, report the presence of an approximately 50 kd low turnover rate protein in the culture medium of MCF 7 cells. Serologic detection of keratin has been reported in a cancer patient. Madri et al. 1983 Lab. Invest. 48 98 107. The present invention provides methods and compositions useful for detecting and monitoring primary and metastatic epithelial tumors, particularly epithelial breast tumors. The method relies on the detection of soluble extracellular cytokeratins which are released into circulation by neoplastic epithelial cells. In one identification, the extracellular cytokeratins have a molecular weight of approximately 40 to 46 kilodaltons and an isoelectric point of 5.0 to 5.2. They are related to approximately 42 to 48 kd proteins found on the cell surface of neoplastic epithelial cells. Both the extracellular cytokeratins and the cell surface proteins are in turn related to intracellular cytokeratin, but in another identification of the extracellular cytokeratin it differs from both intracellular cytokeratin and cell surface cytokeratin in that it has a blocked N terminus, is soluble in aqueous solution and is immunologically related to Type 8 or Type 18 intracellular cytokeratins. Detection of the extracellular cytokeratin may be conveniently accomplished by reaction with monoclonal antibodies derived from hybridoma cell lines UCD AB 6.11, UCD PR 10.11, or other antibodies having a similar specificity. Monoclonal antibodies capable of reacting with epithelial cytokeratins, particularly UCD PR 10.11, may be utilized to distinguish epithelial tumors carcinomas from non epithelial tumors such as sarcomas and lymphomas. Moreover, groups or panels of antibodies may be utilized to distinguish among primary and metastatic breast tumors of ductal epithelial, secretory epithelial, and myoepithelial origin. Methods and compositions are provided for the detection, identification, and monitoring of epithelial tumors, particularly mammary epithelial tumors. It has been found that both normal and neoplastic epithelial cells are characterized by the presence of an about 42 to 48 kilodalton kd protein on the cell surface, which protein is immunologically and compositionally related to intracellular cytokeratin. It has also been found that a smaller form of the cytokeratin related protein about 40 to 46 kd is released by both normal and neoplastic cells, but that the rate of release from neoplastic cells is significantly higher. Thus, a patient population may be screened for epithelial neoplasms by assaying for the presence of such extracellular cytokeratins in serum. The assay is particularly suitable for monitoring the progress of patients undergoing treatment for epithelial neoplasms. Intermediate filaments are a major component of the cytoskeleton in many types of cells. Epithelial cells of tissues such as the mammary gland contain soluble intermediate filaments composed of keratin. These proteins, referred to as cytokeratins, are found in both normal and neoplastic mammary cells and comprise a group of at least 19 distinct proteins, referred to as Types 1 through 19 Moll et al. 1982 Cell 31 11 . Heretofore, such cytokeratins have been believed to be intracellular cytoskeletal proteins. The work reported in the Experimental section hereinafter, however, demonstrates that proteins which are immunologically and compositionally related to such intracellular cytokeratins can also be found on the cell surface and be secreted from the cells. The cell surface cytokeratin and soluble extracellular cytokeratin identified by the present invention are structurally and immunologically related to, but not identical, to known intracellular cytokeratins. Structurally related means that there is at least 60 homology between the extracellular cell surface cytokeratins and the intracellular cytokeratins, usually being 75 or greater homology. Immunologically related means that there will be at least one common epitopic site among the cytokeratins, usually being a plurality of epitopic sites, but fewer than all epitopic sites. In the exemplary case of breast epithelial cells, it is found that there are at least three epitopes present on the cell surface cytokeratin which are immunologically cross reactive with Types 8, 18 and 19 intracellular cytokeratins. The extracellular cytokeratin which is released from breast epithelial cells is most strongly cross reactive with Type 8 and Type 18 intracellular cytokeratin and is soluble in aqueous solution. It is further found that the extracellular cytokeratin has a blocked N terminus. Detection of the extracellular cytokeratin in a biological fluid, such as serum, can be related to the status of an epithelial carcinoma. Neoplastic epithelial cells release the cytokeratin at an increased rate relative to normal epithelial cells, and observing the serum level of cytokeratin can be related to the status of the disease. For example, serum levels of cytokeratins will be expected to decrease after a tumor is surgically removed or regression is induced by other forms of therapy. Serum levels of the patient can subsequently be monitored to detect increased levels of extracellular cytokeratins which would be diagnostic of an increased tumor load, either primary or metastic. The present invention is also useful for screening tumor cells to determine the cellular origin of the tumor cells. The presence of cytokeratins in the tumor cells is diagnostic of the epithelial origin of the cells. Thus, epithelial tumors may be distinguished from non epithelial tumors by reaction with antibody specific for the cell cytokeratins. Moreover, it has been found that certain antibodies reactive with cytokeratins are able to distinguish among ductal epithelial, secretory epithelial, and myoepithelial breast cells. Thus, by employing a group or panel of antibodies which are reactive with each type of epithelial breast cell, but substantially less reactive with the other two types of epithelial breast cell, the cellular origin of a breast tumor may be determined, conveniently by histochemical staining techniques. By substantially less reactive, it is meant that it will be possible to evaluate positive and negative samples based on reactivity with the antibody by means of conventional techniques. Knowledge of the cellular origin of a tumor is useful in selecting the proper mode of therapy. Conveniently, the presence of the cell cytokeratins and the soluble extracellular cytokeratins may be determined immunologically employing conventional immunoassays or histochemical staining techniques using antibodies reactive with the proteins. Such antibodies can be prepared conventionally as described below employing either the cell cytokeratins or extracellular cytokeratins, or antigenic fragments thereof, as the immunogen. Conveniently, whole or lysed cells from breast tumor cell lines may be employed as the immunogen. Alternatively, antibodies specific for the cytokeratins may be utilized to isolate the cytokeratins from serum, primary tumor cells, or tumor cell lines, to obtain purified antigen for use as the immunogen. Antibodies may be obtained by injecting the desired immunogen into a wide variety of vertebrates in accordance with conventional techniques. Suitable vertebrates include mice, rats, sheep and goats, in particular mice. Usually, the animals are bled periodically with successive bleeds having improved titer and specificity. The antigens may be injected intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, or the like. Usually, a vehicle is employed such as complete or incomplete Freund s adjuvant. If desired, monoclonal antibodies can be prepared. To obtain monoclonal antibodies, spleen cells from the immunized vertebrate are immortalized. The manner of immortalization is not critical. Presently, the most common method is fusion with a myeloma fusion partner. Other techniques include EBV transformation, transformation with bare DNA, e.g., oncogenes, retro viruses, etc., or any other method which provides for stable maintenance of the cell line and production of monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by fusion of the spleen cells with an appropriate human fusion ptartner, such as WI L2, described in European patent EP A 0 062 409. A detailed technique for producing mouse x mouse monoclonal antibodies is taught by Oi and Herzenberg, in Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology, Mishell and Shiigi eds. , W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco 1980 pp 351 372. The antibodies of the present invention may be of any immunoglobulin class, i.e., IgG, including IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b, IgA, IgD, IgE and IgM, usually being IgG or IgM. Particularly useful monoclonal antibodies have been prepared for use in the present invention. Antibody UCD AB 6.11 is reactive with the intracellular, cell surface, and extracellular forms of epithelial cytokeratins, particularly with Type 18 cytokeratin which is characteristic of secretory epithelial cells. Antibody UCD PR 10.11 is reactive with intra cellular and extracellular forms of cytokeratin, particularly with Type 8 cytokeratins which are characteristic of ductal epithelial cells. UCD PR 7.01 is reactive with intracellular and extracellular forms of an antigen which is characteristic of myoepithelial cells. These three antibodies are particularly suitable for screening neoplastic epithelial cells to determine whether they are of ductal, secretory, or myoepithelial origin. Antibody UCD PR 10.11 is also particularly suitable for screening tumor cells to determine if they are of epithelial origin. It is found that the UCD PR 10.11 antibody has a high affinity for epithelial cells and provides highly specific staining with very low background levels. Once antibodies having suitable specificity have been prepared, a wide variety of immunological assay methods are available. Numerous competitive and non competitive protein binding assays have been described in the scientific and patent literature, and a large number of such assays are commercially available. Exemplary immunoassays which are suitable for detecting the serum antigen include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,791,932 3,817,837 3,839,153 3,850,752 3,850,578 3,853,987 3,867,517 3,879,262 3,901,654 3,935,074 3,984,533 3,996,345 4,034,074 and 4,098,876. It will usually be necessary to pretreat the biological sample in some manner prior to performing the immunoassay. Sample preparation will vary depending on the source of the biological sample. Solid tumors and other tissue samples will be prepared by lysing the cells. Serum samples will typically be prepared by clotting whole blood and isolating the supernatant in accordance with well known methods. Other biological fluids, such as semen, sputum, and urine, may also be assayed for the presence of the extracellular cytokeratin. Conventional immunohistochemical staining techniques may also be used for detecting the cytokeratins in tissue samples. For example, the tissue sample may be fixed in formalin, B 5 or other standard histological preservatives, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin as is routine in any hospital pathology laboratory. Sections may be cut from the paraffin and mounted on glass slides. The cellular antigen can then be detected and localized either by exposure to labelled antibody and a labelled secondary antibody. Alternatively, cytological preparations may be used. For example, cells from the tissue sample may be fixed on a slide, typically by exposure to formalin in a buffer at physiologic pH followed by suspension in acetone and pelleting onto gelatin coated slides by centrifugation. The cell surface receptor may then be localized, either by exposure to labelled antibody or by exposure to unlabelled antibody and a labelled secondary antibody. The amount of the cell surface protein in the sample is directly proportional to the amount of bound label. Whole body imaging techniques employing radioisotope labels can be utilized for locating epithelial tumors, particularly breast carcinomas which have metastisized. The antibodies of the present invention, or fragments thereof, are bound to a suitable radioisotope, typically technetium 99, ¹²³iodine, The following experiments are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. The following abbreviations are used 1. MCF 7 cells. The MCF 7 human mammary tumor cell line was used to both immunize and screen for antibody production. This is a well characterized cell line that was derived from a pleural effusion of a patient with metastatic breast cancer Soule et al. 1973 J. Natl. Cancer Res. 51 1409 1416 . It has been shown to contain both estrogen and progesterone receptors. 2. HBL 100. HBL 100 is a non malignant human breast epithelial cell line developed from lactating breast milk sample Polanowski et al. 1976 3. 186 NWT. 186 NWT is a human epithelial cell line developed from ascites fluid from a patient with metastatic breast cancer. It has not shown any breast cell markers and is ER negative. 4. P3x63Ag8.653. This is a mouse myeloma cell line used as a hybridoma fusion partner for MCA production. It does not produce immunoglobulin or any immunoglobulin subunits Kearney et al. 1979 J. Immunol. 123 1548 1555 . Hybridoma cell lines were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute Tissue Culture Medium 1640 Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, N.Y. supplemented with 10 heat inactivated calf serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L glutamine, and 25 µg ml gentamicin. Human breast cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Minimal essential medium with either 5 calf or horse serum, 1 µg ml insulin, 25 µg ml gentamicin and 100 nM 17β estradiol Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. . 5. Cell line AE1 is a hybridoma cell line described by Tseng et al. 1982 Cell 30 361 372, which was prepared by immunization with cytokeratins. The antibodies produced by the cell line are specific for all acidic cytokeratins and specifically for MCF 7 Type 19. 6. Cell line βH11 is a hybridoma cell line described by Gown and Vogel 1982 J. Cell Biol. 95 414 424, which was prepared by immunization with cytokeratin. The antibodies produced by the cell line are specific for cytokeratin Type 8, 18 and 19 in MCF 7 cells. Paraffin blocks of normal and malignant human breast tissue were obtained from the School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, University of California Medical Center, Sacramento, California. Delapidated HMFGM was prepared by extracting the cream fraction of human milk with chloroform and ether Ceriani et al. 1977 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74 582 586 . A standard polyethylene glycol fusion, hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine selection procedure as described by Oi and Herzenberg 1980 in Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology, Mishell and Shiigi, eds., W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, CA pp. 351 372. Antibody producing clones were identified with radioiodinated rabbit anti mouse IgG by solid phase RIA and autoradiography as described by Tsu and Herzenberg 1980 BALB c mice were hyperimmunized with live intact MCF 7 cells 2 X 10⁶ cells intraperitoneally once per week for three weeks. After three weeks, the mice were immunized a fourth time with 2 X 10⁶ cells intraperitoneally three days prior to the fusion. Mouse spleen cells were then hybridized with P3x63Ag8.653 mouse myeloma cells. Whole live MCF 7 and HBL 100 cells were also used in solid phase RIA for first and second level screening Brown et al. 1979 J. Immunol. Methods 31 201 209 . Live cells were used to avoid selecting for fixation artifacts. MCF 7 was used as a positive screen to identify antibodies against antigens on ER positive cells. HBL 100 was used as a negative screen to identify ER negative antibodies. HMFGM isolated from normal human milk was also used to select against normal breast epithelial surface components using a standard solid phase RIA Tsu and Herzenberg 1980 The final screening criteria were based on direct visualization of antigen distribution in paraffin slides using the immunoperoxidase technique for detection of antigens. Second generation monoclonal antibodies were produced as above, except that the mice were immunized with antigen isolated from either MCF 7 tissue culture medium fusion series 10 antibodies or a membrane extract from 186 NWT cells fusion series 7 antibodies . The antigens were isolated using an immunoaffinity column prepared with UCD AB 6.11 antibodies, as described below. Screening procedures for the second generation antibodies were as follows. Selection of the second generation antibodies was based on reactivity in solid phase RIA, Western Blots and immunoperoxidase see below for details . The MCA s were isotyped using the double diffusion method of Ouchterlony and Nilsson 1973 in Handbook of Experimental Immunology, Weir, ed. Blackwell, London, chapter 19 . Supernatants from each clone and ascites fluid diluted 1 100 in PBS 0.9 NaCl, 10 mM NaPO₄, pH 7.5 were reacted against antisera specific for each immunoglobulin class IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG3, and IgA. Class specific antisera were purchased from Miles Laboratories, Inc., Elkhart, Ind. Cells were harvested from 75 cm² tissue culture flasks by trypsinization, plated in 96 well tissue culture plates at 50,000 cells per well and incubated for 18 to 24 hours. All incubations were at 37 C in 5 CO₂. Growth media were aspirated, 150 µl of growth media containing 0.08 sodium azide was added, and cells were incubated for 30 minutes. Cells were rinsed with Hank s balanced salt solution containing 5 calf sera and 0.08 sodium azide wash buffer . Wash buffer 100 µl was then added and the cells were incubated for 30 minutes. The cells were again rinsed with wash buffer and 50 µl of tissue culture fluid from a hybridoma culture or diluted ascites was added and incubated for 1 hour. The cells were then rinsed twice with wash buffer, and 50 µl 2 X 10⁴ cpm of Proteins were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE , as described by Laemmli 1970 Nature 227 680 685, using a 4 acrylamide stacking gel with a 10 resolving gel, both containing 0.2 SDS. Samples were applied in 50 µl of sample buffer 63 mM TRIS pH 6.8, 10 glycerol, 5 2 mercaptoethanol, 2.3 SDS and were electrophoresed for four hours with a constant current of 20 mA. The molecular weights of proteins were estimated by their mobilities relative to standard proteins of known molecular weight. Two dimensional electrophoresis was performed as described by O Farrell 1975 J. Biol. Chem. 250 4007 4021, except SDS PAGE in the second dimension was as described above. Either 40 µl of immunoaffinity purified tissue culture fluid evaporated to dryness and redissolved in lysis buffer or 40 µl of cellular proteins dissolved in lysis buffer 1 confluent 100 mm petri dish dissolved in 2 ml of lysis buffer were analysed. Protein concentration was determined using a dye binding assay Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA . To characterize the antigen identified by the antibody, a modification of the Western blot as described by Towbin, et al. 1979 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76 4350 4354 was used in which the proteins are transferred from SDS PAGE gels to nitrocellulose filters and identified by the MCA. After transfer to the nitrocellulose filters, excess protein binding sites were blocked by soaking the filters in PBS containing 3 BSA. The antigen was located by incubating the sheet in 30 ml of PBS containing 1 BSA and 1 2 X 10⁷ cpm of iodinated antibody for one hour. The filter was then rinsed, dried and autoradiographed. As little as 100 pg of protein can be detected with this procedure. Cells were grown for 10 days in 5 calf serum treated with DCC to remove steroid hormones. Two days prior to testing, cells were trypsinized and plated at 4 x 10⁶ cells per 100 mm petri dish. After 24 hours, estradiol was added to the media to attain concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 100 nM estradiol. The media was changed after 24 hours. After 48 hours of hormone treatment, the cells were washed twice with Hank s balanced salt solution. Serum free media, hormone supplemented as above, containing 10 of the normal methionine concentration plus 200 µCi ml of The immunoperoxidase staining procedure used was a modification of the avidin biotin immunoperoxidase technique of Hsu et al. 1981 J. Histochem. Cytochem. 29 577 580 as described by Horan Hand et al. 1983 Cancer Res. 43 728 735. Sepharose 4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, New Jersey was activated with cyanogen bromide as described by March et al. 1974 Anal. Biochem. 60 149 152. Antibodies were purified from ascites by precipitation in 40 ammonium sulfate at 4 C overnight. The precipitate was dissolved in and dialysed against 0.2 M NaPO₄, pH 7.3. One volume of activated Sepharose , which had been filtered down to a compact cake, was added to 1.5 volumes of antibody solution 2 mg protein ml . Antibody was coupled for 16 hours at 4 C with gentle mixing. The Sepharose was again filtered to a compact cake, washed with three volumes of water and added to 1.5 volumes of 1 M ethanolamine, pH 9, to block unreacted sites. This reaction was for two hours at 27 C. The Sepharose was then washed with ten volumes each of phosphate buffer 0.1 M NaPO₄, pH 7.3, 1.0 M NaCl , 0.1 M acetic acid, and phosphate buffer again in that order. The resin was stored at 4 C in phosphate buffer with 0.1 sodium azide. The affinity resin was poured into 0.2 1.0 ml columns, stripped with five column volumes of 6 M guanidine HCl pH 1.5, and rinsed with at least ten volumes of PBS before use. Tissue culture fluid was collected and 2 mM EDTA and phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride added to inhibit proteolysis. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 X g for 20 minutes followed by filtration through glass wool and 0.22 micron filters. The sample was passed through a 1 ml column of Sepharose 4B before being passed through the affinity column at 20 30 ml hour at 4 C. Nonspecifically bound protein was eluted with 10 20 ml of 0.5 M urea in PBS. Antigen was eluted with four column volumes of 6M guanidine HCl pH 1.5, the eluent neutralized, and dialysed. Antibodies were iodinated by a chloramine T method McConahey et al. 1980 Methods Enzymol. 70 210 213 to a specific activity of approximately 2 µCi µg. Reaction products were separated on a 1 cm by 30 cm column of Sephadex G 25 in PBS with 1 BSA and were stored at 70 C until use. The autoradiographic binding pattern in the live cell RIA was the basis of the initial selection of MCA. Eighty seven out of 288 wells from the initial fusion contained hybrid colonies that produced antibody against the MCF 7 cell line. Twenty two of these colonies were chosen for expansion and further characterization. Nine colonies were cloned by limiting dilution. From these, two antibodies designated UCD AB 6.01 and UCD AB 6.11 were chosen for further characterization. The specificity of UCD AB 6.11 for MCF 7 was demonstrated by the Western blot technique. UCD AB 6.11 bound to two SDS PAGE bands in MCF 7 extracts but did not show any binding to HBL 100, NWT 186 HWT extracts or to HMFGM. For comparison, another clone, designated UCD AB 6.13, showed binding to all three cell lines but not the HMFGM. Detection of cellular antigens in paraffin sections using the avidin biotin immunoperoxidase technique was performed to assure that the MCA s were binding human breast antigens and not just tissue culture artifacts of MCF 7. The distribution of the antigens identified by UCD AB 6.11 in normal, dysplastic and malignant breast tissue were determined using formalin and B 5 fixed tissue. B 5 fixation gave the better cytologic detail. Using avidin biotin immunoperoxidase staining, UCD AB 6.11 was found to bind to normal prelactating epithelial cells, but not with normal myoepithelium, stroma, or luminal secretory products. The antigen detected by UCD AB 6.11 was primarily localized in supranuclear granules. This antigen had a patchy distribution between globules so that a positively staining globule was often found adjacent to a negatively staining globule. In many cases, adjacent cells within an individual globule were alternatively positive and negative. Paraffin sections of 90 18 20 of the breast cancer cells stained with immunoperoxidase were positive for UCD AB 6.11. Most of the malignant cells in a given tissue section stained. The staining pattern was generally diffuse and cytoplasmic, although granular and surface staining were also observed. Staining was much more intense in the tumor cells than in adjacent normal cells. Staining was also more intense in metastatic tumor cells than in primary breast tumor cells. These results indicate that there is increased production of the antigen in the metastatic breast cancer cells. Some but not all mammary dysplasias fibrocystic disease were stained with UCD AB 6.11. Second generation monoclonal antibodies resulting from immunization with antigen isolated by immunochromatography with 6.11 antibody from MCF 7 tissue culture medium were designated series 10. The particular antibodies selected for further characterization and testing were UCD PR 10.02, UCD PR 10.11, and UCD PR 10.12. UCD PR 10.02 is a murine IgM which reacts with type 18 cytokeratin, but does not inhibit binding of UCD AB 6.11 or UCD PR 10.11 to the antigen recognized by UCD AB 6.11 6.11 antigen . UCD PR 10.11 is a murine IgG which reacts with the 6.11 antigen as well as type 8 cytokeratin and, to a lesser extent, with type 18 cytokeratin. UCD PR 10.12 is a murine IgM which reacts with the 6.11 antigen. Second generation monoclonal antibodies resulting from immunization with antigen isolated by immunochromatography with 6.11 antibody from 186 NWT cells were designated series 7. One particular antibody, designated UCD PR 7.01, was found to be specific for myoepithelial cells. Iodination of the cell surface proteins of live cells by lactoperoxidase followed by immunoprecipitation was used to further characterize the cell surface location of the antigen identified by UCD AB 6.11. This data showed that the antigen is located on the cell surface when the cells are grown either with or without estradiol. Three types of intracellular keratin related proteins related to Types 8, 18 and 19 were identified in the MCF 7 mammary carcinoma cell line. These proteins were estimated to have molecular weights of about 52, 46, and 40 kd and isoelectric points in the range from 6.1 6.0, 5.8 5.3, and 5.2 5.0, respectively. The multiple isoelectric forms observed are believed to be due at least in part to varying phosphorylation of the keratins. Immunoblots using anti keratin monoclonal antibodies resulted in different patterns of binding for each antibody against each protein type. For example, the 35 βH11 antibody recognized all three MCF 7 cell keratin related proteins, whereas AE1, UCD AB 6.01, UCD AB 6.11 and UCD PR 10.11 each distinguished between the various protein types. See Table 1. In order to determine the tissue distribution of the epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies UCD AB 6.11 and UCD PR 10.11, and to evaluate the utility of these antibodies in immunodiagnosis, large numbers of formalin or B5 fixed paraffin tissue sections were screened by the avidin biotin immunoperoxidase technique. The results are set forth in Table 2 below. In histologically normal tissues, both antibodies stained simple epithelial including mammary, sweat, and salivary glands, gastric and colonic mucosa, and kidney distal tubules. Both antibodies failed to react with neural and blood elements, although UCD AB 6.11 but not UCD PR 10.11 often reacted weakly with a component of smooth muscle. Indirect immunofluorescence on live, intact MCF 7 cells was performed to visualize surface binding to cell surface epitopes. UCD AB 6.01 and UCD AB 6.11 identified punctate antigens which were dispersed over the entire cell surface with concentrations in regions of cell to cell contact. The cell surface epitopes were readily removed by light trypsin treatment, showed no evidence of patching or capping, and were present when cells were grown in either serum containing or serum free medium. The epitopes recognized by UCD PR 10.11, 35βH11 and AE1, however, could not be detected in analogous indirect immunofluorescence experiments. Antigens related to keratin can also be found as soluble proteins in neoplastic mammary tissue culture media. Culture fluid from the MCF 7, T47D, and SK BR 3 human mammary cell lines have each been found to contain keratin like immunoreactivity. Four out of five monoclonal antibodies tested bind to the antigen from MCF 7 culture supernatants Table 3 , and the antigen has a molecular weight range of 40 46 kilo daltons and an isoelectric point of 5.0 5.2. Additional experiments indicated that the MCF 7 tissue culture antigen has a sedimentation coefficient of 3.6S and a buoyant density of 1.25 g cm³. This MCF 7 extracellular antigen thus appears to be related to intracellular cytokeratin. First, antibodies raised against non mammary keratins such as 35βH11 and AE1 recognize the antigen. Second, when hybridomas are produced from mice immunized with the immunoaffinity purified MCF 7 tissue culture fluid antigen, the resulting antibodies such as UCD PR 10.11 are broadly reactive with non mammary keratins. Third, the amino acid composition of the purified MCF 7 antigen closely approximates that found for other keratins, particularly in that glycine and glutamic acid glutamine residues comprise 25 30 of the total amino acids in the protein. See Table 4. UCD AB 6.11 was employed in a radioimmunoassay to detect the presence of extracellular cytokeratin in both normal serum and serum from patients suffering from breast cancer. The assay was a modification of the two site immunoradiometric assay IRMA described by Miles et al. 1973 in Radioimmunoassays and Related Procedures in Medicine, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria, pp. 149 164, Vol. 1. Purified monoclonal antibody UCD AB 6.11 was adsorbed on plastic microtiter plate wells. After adsorption, sample serum was placed into each well. If the extracellular cytokeratin was present in the serum sample, UCD AB 6.11 bound to the solid phase reacted to capture the cytokeratin. Excess purified rabbit IgG antibody specific for a different epitope on the cytokeratin was then introduced to the microtiter wells where it reacted with the bound cytokeratin if any . Excess ¹²⁵I radiolabelled protein A was then introduced to the wells where it reacted with the rabbit IgG. After washing to remove unbound labelled protein A, the amount of radioactivity in each well was determined. The amount of extracellular cytokeratin was thus directly proportional to the amount of bound radioactivity. Absolute amounts of cytokeratin were determined from a previously prepared standard curve. When normal serum was assayed for the presence of extracellular cytokeratin, values obtained ranged from 140 to 3260 CPM, corresponding to 0.02 µg ml to 0.82 µg ml. For breast cancer patients, the values were 340 to 10,800 CPM, corresponding to 0.05 µg ml to 33.4 µg ml. Choosing 1000 CPM as an arbitrary cut off, two out of 14 14 of normal serum samples were positive. For breast cancer patients, 30 out of 83 36 were positive. Thus, the presence of extracellular cytokeratin in serum is significantly elevated in patients suffering from epithelial tumors, such as breast cancer. In accordance with the subject invention, accurate and sensitive assay are provided for detecting the presence of a particular 42 to 48 kd cell protein and a related 40 to 46 kd serum protein in biological samples. The method is particularly useful for identifying those breast tumors which are responsive to estrogen therapy. The method is also useful for identifying such estrogen sensitive breast tumors which have metastisized from the breast, and for screening patient s sera for such tumors.
