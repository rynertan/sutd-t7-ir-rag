# Material discharge unit.

## Abstract
It is an object of the invention to provide a unit for discharging material, such as lengths of paper strip from an air stream. A flow of air with suspended waste material enters, as illustrated by the arrow 1, along a duct 2. The flow is into an entry section 4 of a perforated duct 5 located within an outer casing 6 which forms an air duct. At the downstream end, the duct 5 leads into a bend section 7 which is perforated on the outside of the bend and at the sides. The flow of air or gas continues out of the open end 8 of the casing 6 as indicated by the arrow 9, while the suspended solid material is deflected by the bend section into a discharge duct 11, down which the solid material falls by gravity. The duct 11 is shown as including two pairs of optional isolating flap valves 12 so as to provide an air lock arrangement so that the air flow in the duct 11 is substantial ly zero.
