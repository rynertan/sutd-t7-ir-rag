# Fiberscope.

## Abstract
A fiberscope, particularly, a fiberscope adapted to be inserted into a blood vessel 5 or the like, having a reduced diameter and reduced flow rate of flushing fluid. A cylindric ally shaped inflatable balloon 21 is disposed around the flexible tube 1 of the fiberscope somewhat rearward of the tip end. When an observation is to be performed, the balloon 21 is inflated ro reduce the flow rate of blood in the vessel 5 . As a result, the amount and flow rate of the flushing fluid needed to provide a clear visual field between the tip of the fiberscope and the wall of the vessel to be observed are reduced.
