# Electrical surveys of underwater of underground structures.

## Abstract
Offshore or onshore electrical surveys of buried or submerged structures such as pipeline 11, 30 are con ducted in a fixed cell to moving cell 28, 20 fashion either before or after one or more established pipe to electrolyte potentials are obtained. The results of the fixed cell to moving cell survey are then corrected by a summation of the fixed to moving cell recorded poten tial and the established potential at a location of the established potential to obtain a reliable electrical sur vey of the structure. As indicated, the fixed cell to moving cell survey may be conducted either before or after the established potential is obtained or either be fore or after a disposable wire survey using a direct connection to the structure.
