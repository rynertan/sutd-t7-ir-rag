# Catalyst for the polymerisation of conjugated dienes.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a catalyst system comprising a a compound of a rare earth element and, as cocatalyst, a second component b comprising an organomagnesium compound. In the polymerisation of a conjugated diene this catalyst gives a polymer having a very high content of trans 1,4 isomer. A third component c which is a Lewis acid alters the reaction to give a polymer having a very high content of cis 1,4 isomer. If desired reaction can be initiated using components a and b alone and component c then added at the desired conversion to produce a block polymer having a block of high trans content followed by a block of high cis content.
