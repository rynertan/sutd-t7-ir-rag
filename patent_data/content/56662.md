# Extrudable compositions for making refractory cores for sandcasting of ferrous alloys.

## Abstract
The compositions, which are suitable for making refrac tory cores as described in the parent application, comprise 100 parts by weight of refractory particles, 4 to 20 parts by weight of an organic binder, a plasticiser and or a tempering fluid, and a mineralizer which may be present in the refractory particles or a separate ingredient in an amount sufficient to provide at least 0.04 parts by weight of devitrifying ions. At least 80 by weight of the refractory particles is vitreous silica, at least a quarter by weight of the latter having a particle size of 1 to 30 microns, and at least 40 by weight of the refractory particles have a particle size of 50 to 150 microns.
