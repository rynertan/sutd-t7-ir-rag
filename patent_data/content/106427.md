# Method and apparatus for bending wood.

## Abstract
An integral wood veneer strip 10 having first, second 62 and third 64 portions with the second portion disposed at less than 180 to the first portion and the third portion disposed at less than 180 to the second portion is produced simply and easily. A number of similarly shaped thin strips of wood 11, with adhesive 12 between them, are placed together to form a linear laminate. Before curing of the adhesive, the laminate is placed in contact with a particularly contoured female die surface 25, with a flexible band 13 over the laminate. A male die surface provides a pressing force at a central portion of the band to press the laminate into close conformance with the female die surface, and the ends of the band are attached up to roller 17, 18. The rollers are rotated to tighten the ends of the band, also bringing the ends of the laminate into tight contact with the female die surface. The adhesive is cured while the laminate is in the bent position the curing may be facilitated by using microwaves from source 57 , and then the laminate is released after curing, and may be utilized as decorative molding for furniture 66.
