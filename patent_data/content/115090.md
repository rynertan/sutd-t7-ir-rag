# Masonry blocks.

## Abstract
A masonry block 10 , cast in a mould and compacted by a gravity impact method has one or more core holes 14 surrounded at one end by a rim 15 and at the other end by a socket 20 , the rims 15 and sockets 20 having tapered walls 16 which form a line of contact to prevent ingress of water into the blocks by capillary means. The blocks are laid in bond so that each block in a course overlies, and engages, at least two blocks in the course below it.

## Description
Masonry blocks. This invention relates to masonry blocks. The masonry blocks presently available have a number of significant disadvantages. The concrete in the blocks is generally poorly compacted and the blocks have a low permeability.They are difficult to lay correctly, do not form a strong bond at the corners of a building structure and require concrete or mortar to bond the blocks together. Other disadvantages will be well known to the skilled addressee. It is an object of the present invention to provide masonry blocks which overcome some, or all, of the above disadvantages. It is a preferred object to provide masonry blocks which may be interlocked together. It is a further preferred object to provide blocks which can be sealed together with integral resilient seals. It is a still further preferred object to provide blocks which can be manufactured on a modular basis, e.g. with 1, 2, 3 or 4 holes. Other preferred objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description. In one aspect the present invention resides in a masonry block of concrete or like material including a substantially rectangular block having at least one core hole therethrough a raised rim around the core hole at one end of the core hole a complementary recessed socket around the core hole at the other end of the core hole, so arranged that at least one rim on one of said masonry blocks will engage in a corresponding socket or sockets in a superimposed block. In a second aspect, the present invention resides in a building construction incorporating said masonry blocks. Preferably the rims are inwardly tapered towards the top of the blocks and the sockets have a corresponding taper. The blocks may have one, two, three of four core holes, the lengths of the blocks being arranged on a modular basis. Preferably a pair of rubber, neoprene or other plastics material sealing strips are engaged in slots in one end of the blocks to sealably engage the other end of adjacent blocks.Sealing strips may also be provided between the rims around adjacent holes in the masonry blocks to sealably engage a superimposed block or blocks . Preferably the concrete in the blocks has a high impermeability. Reinforcing wires or fibres, e.g. of steel, glass or plastics material may be embedded in the concrete to increase the strength of the blocks. To enable the invention to be fully understood, a preferred embodiment will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective top view of a four hole block Fig. 2 is a perspective underside view corresponding toFig. 1 Fig. 3 is a sectional side view showing a block superimposed on two blocks in a lower course, locking them together. The block 10 is cast and compacted in concrete in a suitable steel mould, the blocks being compacted by pressing a gravity impact compaction to form a dense, highly impervious block. The block is rectangular in plan, end view and side view, with side walls 11 and end walls 12. The length of the side walls 11 is four times the width of the end walls 12. Three intermediate walls 13, at equal spacings, combine with the side and end walls to form four square core holes 14 through the block, the core holes 14 having equal dimensions. At the top of the block 10, a peripheral rim 15 is formed around each core hole, each rim 15 having an inclined wall 16 the rim tapering inwardly towards the top of the block. As shown in Fig. 1, the rims 15 are spaced from the side and end walls 11, 12 to provide a peripheral abutment face 17 around the top of the block, while a raised portion 18 is provided between each pair of rims 15. Referring now to Fig. 2, a peripheral abutment face 19 is provided around the bottom of the block. Recessed sockets 20, each having inwardly tapered walls 21 towards the top of the block, surround the core holes 14, each socket 20 corresponding to a rim 15 around the top of each core hole. As shown, the bottom face 22 of each intermediate wall 13 is spaced from the bottom of the block to provide clearance for the raised portions 18 when a block is superimposed on another block. A pair of spaced, vertical grooves are formed in one of the end walls 12 and a neoprene sealing strip 23 is firmly engaged in each groove. Small neoprene sealing strips may also be engaged in grooves extending across the block in the raised portions 18 . Referring to Fig. 3, a wall is constructed using the masonry blocks as follows. A first block 10a is placed on a flat foundation not shown .A second block 10b is laid end to end to the first block 10a, the sealing strips 23 on the block 10b engaging the adjacent end wall 12 of the block 10a. The first course of blocks is completed by repeating this step. The second course is then laid on top of the first course.As shown, the third block 10c is laid in half bond, equally spanning the first and second blocks 10a, 10b, with 2 rims each of blocks 10a, 10b engaging in the complementary sockets 20 in the block 10c. Sealing strips of neoprene 24 laid along the raised portions 18 of the blocks 10a, lOb sealably engage the bottom faces 22 of the block 10c to form a seal therebetween. To finish the second course, blocks are laid in end to end relationship along the top of the first course, locking adjacent blocks in the first course together. If block 70b was at the end, e.g., of a wall joined by another wall at right angles, a single hole block would be laid to the right hand side of block 10c. A two, three or four hole block is then laid over the free end of block 1Ob and along the block or blocks of the second wall at right angles to the wall shown to join the two walls together. In the third course, the blocks in that course would be laid over that corner block. For cyclonic areas, cyclone bolts can be passed down through the core holes 14, suitable capping plates being laid along the top of the wall and the bolts placed under tension. To increase the strength of the completed wall, soil, rock, concrete, or other filling may be placed down the core holes.Alternatively, an insulating material may be placed down the core holes. In certain applications, rolled steel tubular sections may be passed down through the core holes to form columns to strengthen the wall and at their tops, to support, e.g., a roof structure. It is preferred to select the height of the blocks so that full courses of the blocks will accommodate existing standard door and or window frames, while special lintel beams can be provided which will interlock with the blocks by engagement with the core holes. Where a cavity wall structure is erected, using blocks in parallel spaced relationshiP, galvanized ties can hold the walls relative to one another. Advantages of the present invention include 1. the masonry blocks have an extremely high impermeability, and combined with the neoprene seals, can be used to form a highly weathertight construction 2. the blocks interlock with each other and no mortar or cement is required to bond the blocks together 3. the blocks can be laid in quarter, half or threequarter bond, and the blocks can be manufactured in modular lengths of one, two, three or four times the width of the blocks 4. the core holes through the blocks can receive, inter alia, rolled steel section columns, filling or insulating material or cyclone bolts 5. the blocks can be used with standard door and or window frames, or with specially designed lintel beams which interlock with the blocks 6. cross walls and corners can be easily and effectively locked together and 7. the blocks can be simply and efficiently cast in concrete, which may include suitable reinforcing fibres or other material. Various changes and modifications may be made to the arrangements described without departing from the present invention. For example, a single neoprene seal may be provided centrally of the second end wall to engage the adjacent end wall of a second block between the seals in the end wall of that second block.
