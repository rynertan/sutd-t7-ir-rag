# Synchronous decentralized processing system.

## Abstract
A decentralized processing system has a plurality of subsystems 1...n of the same order and connected to one another. Each subsystem 1..n has a diagnosis means 10, 20, no for diagnosis of failure in other subsystems, and a function to take a suitable countermeasure in response to the result of the diagnosis. When a failure has occurred in any one of the subsystems 1...n constituting the process ing system, each subsystem can conduct a suitable fault time processing in accordance with the state of the failure. After the recovery from the failure, each system can execute a processing for recovering the ordinary status. The subsys tems 1...n can correspond to each other to conduct the processings in synchronization as required. It is, therefore, possible to attain synchronous operation of two or more subsystems in various control systems or the like.
