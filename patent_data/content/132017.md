## Description
This invention relates to a cross bow. A traditional cross bow comprises a short bow or prod which is mounted on a tiller and which, in use, is levelled against the shoulder like its successor the musket. In order to cock the traditional bow the bowstring is drawn back by hand or by means of some mechanical aid which can range from a simple lever to a windlass or the rack and pinion mechanism cranequin . One of the disadvantages in the use of a cross bow lies in the time taken to span and discharge the bow. Known mechanisms are operable so as to draw back the bowstring away from the prod which remains fixed relative to the tiller, until the bowstring is arrested ready to receive a bolt. This well known method also has the disadvantage that in drawing back the bowstring some measure of torque is applied to it so that when the bow is discharged torsion in the bowstring suddenly is relieved which can disturb the smooth discharge of the bolt. The Encyclopaedia van Wapens , Uitgeverij Helmond B.V. Helmond 1981 , page 105 Original Title Weapons , Diagram Visual Information Ltd 1980 discloses a cross bow having a tiller which carries a prod and a bowstring arrestor and release mechanism in which the bowstring arrestor and release mechanism is mounted for reciprocal movement relative to the tiller to facilitate cocking the bow. The present invention seeks to overcome these disadvantages and to give a rapid loading, smooth firing bow. One aspect of the invention provides a cross bow having a tiller which carries a prod and a bowstring arrestor and release mechanism characterized in that said prod is mounted for reciprocal movement relative to the tiller to facilitate cocking the bow. Another aspect of the invention provides a method of cocking such a cross bow characterized by reciprocating the prod by first moving the prod together with the bowstring rearwardly along the tiller so that the bowstring is arrested at the end of said rearward travel by a bowstring arrestor and release mechanism and then moving the prod back forwardly along the tiller whilst the bowstring remains arrested so as to tension the bowstring for discharge. Cross bows embodying the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring first to Figures 1 6 of the drawings, there is shown a cross bow 10 suitable for use as a hunting bow, which comprises a tiller 12 having a forend 14, a body or stock 16 and a heel butt 18. A prod 20 mounted on the forend has an upper limb 22 and a lower limb 24 both joined to, and carried by, a draw block 26. The draw block is mounted on the forend 14 for reciprocal movement towards and away from the stock 16 in order to charge the bow. In this embodiment of the invention, the forend 14 comprises a hollow tube of circular cross section and the draw block 26 is formed with a central bore 28 in which the forend tube 14 is a sliding fit. Other forend constructions are envisaged and it will be apparent that the forend may have a cross section other than circular. The free ends of the limbs 22, 24 are interconnected by a stout cord which provides the bowstring 30 of the bow. In order to load and discharge the bow a cocking mechanism known as a draw mechanism, M see Figure 3 is provided which is analogous to a simple slider crank mechanism. The draw mechanism M comprises a crank lever 32 which has one of its ends pivotally mounted to the stock 16 intermediate the forend 14 and heel but 18 by means of a stock pin 34 and has its opposite end pivotally connected intermediate the ends of a connecting lever 36 by means of a crank pin 38. The slider of the draw mechanism comprises the draw block 26 to which one end of the connecting lever 36 pivotally is mounted by means of block pin 40. The connecting lever extends beyond the pivotal connection at the crank pin 38 to provide a grip portion 42 by which the draw mechanism is manipulated. The crank pin 38 provides the fulcrum for the grip portion. The cross bow in uncocked position is best shown in Figures 1 and 2. Here the draw block 26 is disposed adjacent the free end of the forend tube 14 and the drawn mechanism M is in its stable condition. That is to say, the pivot pins 34, 38 and 40 are substantially aligned along but normal of the main longitudinal axis of the tiller. Hence, the crank lever 32 and the connecting lever 36 are superposed one on the other so that the connecting lever lies parallel to the stock 12. In this construction, the stock and the connecting lever 36 each is formed with an elongate recess 44 and 46 respectively which recesses together provide a cavity in which the crank lever 32 is accommodated when the draw mechanism is in its stable condition. Indeed, the grip portion 42 extending between crank pin 38 and the free end of lever 36 is shaped so as to fit flush against, and form part of, the stock when the draw mechanism is in its stable condition. To cock the bow, the grip portion 42 of the connecting lever 36 is manipulated so that it is pushed away from the stock to pivot about block pin 40 see Figures 3 and 3a . This action necessarily causes the draw block to slide along the forend tube 14 towards the adjacent shoulder 16a of the stock. Thus, the prod 20 and bowstring 30 are moved rearwardly together as a unit. A bowstring arrestor and release mechanism shown generally at 48 see Figure 2 is provided on the stock and is positioned automatically to arrest the bowstring when it enters the mouth 50 of the mechanism. This occurs when the draw block 26 comes to the end of its travel along the forend tube 14 and is located at the fixed end of the tube adjacent the stock shoulder 16a. The bowstring arrestor and release mechanism 48 is of known construction Once the bowstring is arrested, the connecting lever 36 is pushed back into flanking relationship with respect to the stock so that the draw mechanism is again put into its stable condition. In so doing, the draw block 26 is constrained to slide along the forend tube 14 to adopt the initial position shown in Figures 1 and 2. Of course, this return motion puts both the prod 20 and bowstring 30 into firing tension whereby the bow is cocked ready to receive a bolt not shown . The bow is charged by introducing the nock of a bolt into the mouth 50 of the arrestor and discharge mechanism 48 so that it is engaged by the bowstring. Suitable support and guide means which, for example could comprise an apertured plate giving the bolt three point support adjacent its tip may be carried by the draw block. Thus, the bolt is held only at its nock and discharged from the bow by squeezing the trigger whereby the bowstring arrestor and discharge mechanism releases the bowstring. In order to level the bow for discharge, a trigger grip 54 extends downwardly from the underside of the stock and is generally constructed to be held in a similar fashion to that of a rifle. Further the heel butt of the bow is formed to provide a shoulder rest 56 which is rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the stock. This feature allows the bow to be held for discharge in either one of two attitudes. Firstly, the bow may be held by its stock 16 and trigger grip 54 with the prod 20, trigger grip 54 and shoulder rest 56 all extending downwardly in a notional plane passing vertically through the tiller 12. Thus, a bolt is discharged from a position in which it is supported alongside the stock opposite to that at which the draw mechanism is carried. In this attitude the bow may be aimed by using the telescopic sight 58 provided on the upper face of the stock. A foresight may be provided by the draw block or by the forend tube if desired. Secondly, the bow may be held by its stock and trigger grip with the prod and trigger extending outwardly in notional plane passing horizontally through the tiller and with the shoulder rest 56 swivelled through 90 degrees in relation to the prod and trigger grip so that it remains in a downwardly extending position. Thus, the bolt is supported uppermost of the stock and the bow is therefore levelled in a manner similar to that of a conventional cross bow construction. This is illustrated in Figure 6. In order to aim the bow when it is held in this attitude an additional aiming sight 60 is provided on the stock. Sight 60 pivotally is mounted to that part of the stock which incorporates the bowstring arrestor and discharge mechanism 48. The sight 60 may be raised into the position shown in Figure 6 from a stowed position in which it lies flush with the stock. It will be appreciated that the draw distance of the prod may be varied in order to alter the potential thrust of the bow. In the draw mechanism described, the ratio of the distance between the block pin to the crank pin and the crank pin to the free end of the connecting lever is approximately 1 2 as measured along the connecting lever. It is to be understood that other ratios may be chosen and indeed the construction may be such as to facilitate such a change. In this regard, the forend tube and or crank lever may be readily removed and replaced by similar components of different lengths and the position of the crank pin along the connecting lever also may be selectively adjustable. Preferably, the block pin 40 is readily removable or releasable to allow the prod 20 to be removed by sliding the draw block 26 forwardly off the forend tube 14, to facilitate carrying of the cross bow. For example, the block pin 40 may be provided by an Allen bolt which is easily removed when required. In another possible arrangement this pivot may be provided by upper and lower spring loaded pins or buttons which can be depressed to provide a quick release of the prod. This removable or releasable facility of the prod also allows different prods, all having the same draw length, to be used interchangeably on the cross bow. Referring now to Figure 7 of the drawings, there is shown another cross bow 62 suitable for use as a target bow. This bow may have a draw mechanism similar to that described previously or may have another or no mechanical aid to facilitate cocking the bow. In relation to the bow 10, like parts are designated with like reference numerals with the addition of suffix a . In this construction the forend 14a of the bow is considerably more elongate and carries a front sight 64. The prod 20a is mounted for selective positioning along the forend so that the draw length of the bow can be adjusted by altering the position of the prod. To this end, the forend may have a dovetail groove into which the prod slidingly is received by means of a cooperating key as shown in Figure 7a. Other key and groove arrangements are envisaged. An additional arrow rest 68 which also can be adjustably mounted on the forend is provided to give support for various length arrows. It is to be understood that the term prod as used in this specification is not limited to the flexible limb construction described and shown but may embrace other constructions by which a cross bow can be charged for firing. For example, it is known to utilize pneumatic rams for this purpose.
