# Process and apparatus for electromagnetically casting or reforming strip materials.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for electromagnetically con taining and forming molten material 16 , into a desired thin strip shape. At least two inductors 24,25 are employed which are powered at respectively different frequencies. The frequency of the current applied to the upstream inductor 24 , is substantially lower than the frequency applied to the downstream inductor 25 thereby providing improved effi ciency and reduced power consumption.
