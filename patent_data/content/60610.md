Compounds of the present invention can be regarded as synthesizable from three synthons, viz., a RH, RH or R H b an alpha,omega disubstituted straight chain alkane or alkane precursor and c a side chain terminal group, or terminal group precursor. Synthesis of 2 piperidon l yl derivatives formula I, p 1, Z methano, A ethano formula V, R5 and R6 are taken together as CH2 3CO illustrate the basic methods of approach which are applied.Method A a b c EMI11.2 a b c EMI11.3 wherein n and R are as defined above and D represents a displaceable group C1, Br, I, CH3SO2O, etc. . This nucleophilic displacement reaction is carried out in a reaction inert solvent, such as a lower aliphatic ketone e.g., acetone, 2 butanone, 3 methyl 2 butanone, 3 methyl 2 pentanone , a lower alkanol e.g., ethanol, 2 propanol , or a lower aliphatic amide e.g., dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide . The pyridoindole RH, R1R is preferably maintained in the form of the much more reactive free base by the addition of at least one equivalent of a base such as sodium carbonate to the reaction mixture. When D is other than I, iodide ion can be added to enhance the reaction rate, if desired.Temperature is not critical, the temperature usually being elevated e.g., 50 1500 C. to enhance the rate of reaction, but not so high ás to cause undesirable levels of thermal degradation of the products and or reactants. The pyrido 4,3 b indoles required for these syntheses and the further syntheses detailed below are available by the methods of U.S. patents 3,687,961 3,983,239 3,991,199 4,001,263 4,141,980 and 4,224,329. The piperidone derivatives are readily available by reaction of the anion of 2 piperidone with a disubstituted alkane, D CH2 nD, wherein D and n are as defined above and the D groups can be the same or different. Bis displacement is minimized by using excess D CH2 nD and or by one group being more readily displaceable e.g., Cl CR2 nBr . Reaction conditions solvent and temperature are generally as described above, except that protic solvents e.g., alcohols , which are more acidic than 2 piperidone, are avoided. The same approach is broadly available for the synthesis of many other compounds of the present invention. For example, those compounds wherein the sidechain terminus is alkanoylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino, Ib to Ij , IIa to IIc , IIIa to IIIf , or N substituted variants thereof.In other cases, for example, those compounds wherein the sidechain terminus ispiperazino qr, of the formula IId IIh , the same approach is just as applicable when equally reactive or more reactive nitrogen atoms are already substituted, e.g.,EMI13.1 If the substituent is a group such as benzyl, the substituent can be removed by hydrogenolysis affording a synthesis of those compounds wherein the terminus is unsubstituted piperazino, or IId to IIh , e.g.,EMI13.2 Method B a b c EMI13.3 a b c EMI13.4 wherein R , n and D are as defined above.This nucleophilic displacement is carried out using substantically equivalent quantities of the reactants, otherwise under conditions as described above for the synthesis ofEMI14.1 While the substituted pyridof4,3 blindoles are potentially available by a number of routes, the preferred route is EMI14.2 The piperidone anion is generally formed in situ by reaction of the piperidone with sodium hydride. This approach is also broadly applicable to the synthesis of other compounds of this invention, applying the principles enunciated in the preceding section, e.g.,EMI14.3 Method C a b c EMI15.1 a b c EMI15.2 wherein R and n are as defined above, and x and y are each 1 or greater and x y 2 n. These are hydrogenation reactions, carried out in an inert solvent under a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, preferably a noble metal catalyst including platinum, palladium, rhodium and ruthenium, either of the, supported or non supported type, as well as the known catalytic compounds thereof such as the oxides, chlorides, etc. Specific examples of suitable catalysts are 5 palladium on carbon, 5 palladium on barium carbonate, 58 rhodium on carbon, rhodium chloride, platinum oxide and 5 ruthenium on carbon. The temperature and pressure of the hydrogenation are not critical, being generally carried out in a temperature range of 10 90 C., conveniently 20 500 C., at a pressure ranging from subatmospheric to 100 atmospheres, or more. A convenient operating pressure is 2 3 atmospheres. The starting materials required for these syntheses are generally available by following method A above, but substituting an unsaturated compound for D CH2 nD, e.g. EMI16.1 Alternatively, the following synthetic route is available EMI16.2 The first stage nucleophilic displacement reaction is carried out under conditions described above. The second stage formaldehyde bridging of the acetylene to. RH, is carried out in a reaction inert solvent a lower alkanol is well suited employing the free base form of RH, an equivalent of formaldehyde conveniently as a 30 aqueous solution and an equivalent of the acetylene in the presence of cuprous chloride as catalyst. Temperature is not critical e.g., 0 50 C. , the reaction being conveniently carried out at ambient temperature 20 25 C. . This approach is further available for the synthesis of many other compounds of the present invention, when the terminus is free of groups which are subject to significant hydrogenation side reaction under the conditions employed for hydrogenation of the unsaturation. In the case of benzyl protecting groups, these can generally be removed in the same reaction as reduction of an unsaturated group, e.g.,EMI17.1 When the terminus is free of carbonyl, hydride reduction of amide precursors is a further viable route to compounds of the present invention, e.g.,EMI17.2 A further variation is to alternatively or simultaneously reduce a different terminal amide group, e.g.,EMI17.3 These hydride reductions are conveniently carried out with excess lithium aluminum hydride two equivalents are required for each amide function in an ether solvent e.g., diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane in the temperature range 0 50 C. Alternatively, such amides are reduced with diborane or aluminum hydride in the same type of solvent, or reacted with triethyloxonium fluoroborate e.g., in methylene chloride at 20 309 C. and then reduced with sodium borohydride in a lower alkanol e.g., ethanol at 0 25 C. It will be noted that the approach of Method C, as detailed above, has particular value in the synthesis of the hexahydropyrido 4,3 b indoles, specified as RH, since the tetrahydro compounds R tH have a double bond which can complicate hydrogenation of an olefin.However, when the terminus of a tetrahydro compound is a precursor amine, then the above lithium aluminum hydride reduction of amide or nitrile is well suited, eg. , EMI18.1 Diborane is, of course, not employed unless simultaneous conversion of tetrahydro to hexahydropyridof4,3 b indole is desired. Method D a b c EMI19.1 a b c EMI19.2 wherein n, R and D are as defined above and R7 is C1 C5 alkyl. The nucleophilic displacement of D is carried out under conditions detailed above. The anion can be preformed or formed in situ with a strong base such as sodium hydride. The intermediate is conEMI19.3 The intermediate amide need not be isolated, but can be formed in situ and then converted to the anion.The acylation is carried out under mild conditions e.g., 25 to 350 C. , usually in a reaction inert solvent in the presence of at least one equivalent of inorganic base or of tert amine e.g., triethylamine,N methylmorpholine . The alternative process, cyclization of the amino ester precursor, is accomplished by mere heating of the free base form of the amino ester in a reaction inert solvent, conveniently an aromatic, hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene or xylene. Temperature is not critical e.g., 80 150 C., preferably 100 125 C. so that the reaction proceeds at a reasonable rate, but thermal degradation is minimized. The preferred value of R7 is methyl, since cyclization occurs most rapidly at the lowest possible temperatures. The amino estersEMI20.1 In modified form, the reactions described immediately above can be applied to the preparation of other compounds of the present invention, e.g.,EMI20.2 wherein n, m, R, R , R4 and R6 are as defined above. In further modified form the basic approach ofMethod D is broadly applicable to the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention, that is, to build the side chain terminus from suitable precursor, e.g.,EMI21.1 wherein A4 is oxygen or NR and n, R and R are as defined above. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the derivatives can be prepared by reaction with either about 1 molar equivalent or about 2 molar equivalents of an organic or mineral acid in either aqueous or nonaqueous solution. Since the compounds of the present invention are generally dibasic, either mono salts or bis salts are thereby formed, depending upon the molar equivalent of acid. Those compounds which are tribasic can, of course, form a tris salt, in which case three molar equivalents of acid can be used. Suitable salt forming acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, phosphoric, methanesulfonic, p toluenesulfonic, lactic, citric, tartaric, succinic, maleic and gluconic acids. The salt can be isolated by removal of the solvent in vacuo or in an appropriate case, by precipitation. The derivatives are useful as neuroleptic agents in the treatment of mental disorders and illnesses including schizophrenia, psychoses and neuroses.Symptoms requiring such treatment include anxiety, aggression, agitation, depression, hallucinations, tension and emotional or social withdrawal. In general, the derivatives exhibit major tranquilizing activity but have fewer side effects than the drugs presently in use. The derivatives can be formulated in a variety of pharmaceutical preparations which contain the derivative alone or in combination with pharmaceutical carriers such as inert solid diluents, aqueous solutions or various non toxic, organic solvents and in dosage forms such as gelatin capsules, tablets, powders, lozenges, syrups, injectable solutions and the like.Such carriers include water, ethanol, gelatins, lactose, starches, vegetable oils, petroleum jelly, gums, glycols, talc, benzoyl alcohols, and other known carriers for medicaments. If desired, these pharmaceutical preparations can contain additional material such as preserving agents, wetting agents, stabilizing agents, lubricating agents, absorption agents, buffering agents and isotonic agents. The derivatives are administered to a patient in need of treatment by a variety of conventional routes of administration such as oral, intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous. In general, small doses will be administered initially with a gradual increase in the dose until the optimum level is determined. However, as with any drug the particular dose, formulation and route of administration will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient and will depend upon the judgment of his attending physician. In the usual course of treatment a dose of a derivative of approximately 0.1 mg per day to 100 mg per day will provide effective treatment for the human patient. When the derivative has a prolonged effect, the dose can be administered less frequently, such as every other day or in 1 or 2 divided doses per week. The tranquilizing activity of the derivatives may be determined using the well known standard procedureantagonism of amphetamine induced symptoms in rats.This method has excellent correlation with human efficacy and is taught by A. Weissman, et al., J.Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 151, p. 339 1966 and by Quinton, et al., Nature 200, p. 178, 1963 , and more particularly by Harbert et al., Molecular Pharmacology 17, pp. 38 41 1980 . In detail neuroleptic effects in vivo were estimated by the blockade of amphetamine stereotypy.Rats were placed individually in covered plastic compartments after a brief period of acclimation in the cages the rats in groups of five were treated intraperitoneally with the test compound at doses separated by 0.5 log units i.e.,...l, 3 2, 10, 32,...mg kg . They were subsequently treated 1, 5, and 24 hr laterEwith d amphetamine sulfate, 5 mg kg ip. One hour after each amphetamine challenge, each rat was assessed for its most characteristic cage movement behavior on a 6 point scale Weissman et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp.Ther. 151, pp. 339 352 1966 1. These ratings represent increasing degrees of drug effect Quinton and Halliwell,Nature London 200, pp. 178 179 1963 and the time of rating chosen coincides with the peak effect of amphetamine Weissman, Psychopharmacologia 12, pp. 142157 1968 . Scores were dichotomized cf. Weissman et al., loc. cit. , and approximate ED50 s were determined, based on the quantal data, Doses are expressed in terms of the hydrochloride salts. As illustrated by the results tabulated in Table I, this method shows that the compounds of the present invention have excellent tranquilizing activity compared to the standard test drug, chlorpromazine. So called intrinsic tranquilizing neuroleptic activity of the derivatives was determined using 3Hspiroperidol binding to dopamine receptor according to the method of Leysen et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 27, p. 307 1978 and was adapted from that of Burt et al., Mol Pharmacol. 12, pp. 800 812 1976 . Rats Sprague Dawley CD males, 250 300 g,Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass. were decapitated, and brains were immediately dissected to recover the corpus striatum. The latter was homogenized in 40 vol of ice cold 50 mM Tris tris hydroxymethyll aminomethane HCl buffer, pH 7.7 with a BrinkmannPolytron PT 10. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 50,000g for 10 minutes at 0 4 with rehomogenization of the intermediate pellet in fresh Tris buffer same volume in the Polytron.The final pellet was gently resuspended in 90 volumes of cold 50 mM TriswHCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 120 mM NaCl, 5mM KC1, 2mM CaCl2, lmM MgC12, 0.18 ascorbic acid, and 10 pM pargyline.The tissue suspension was placed in a 370 water bath for 5 minutes and kept ice cold until use. The incubation mixture consisted of 0.02 ml inhibitor solution or vehicle, 1.0 ml tissue preparation, and 0.10 ml 3R spiroperidol New England Nuclear, 23.6 Ci mmol prepared so as to obtain 0.5 nM final concentration.Tubes were incubated in sequence for 10 minutes at 370 in groups of three, after which 0.9 ml from each incubation tube was filtered through Whatman GF B filters with vacuum. After washing twice with 5 ml of cold tris HC1 buffer, pH 7.7, each filter was placed in a scintillation vial with 10 ml Aquasol 2 New England Nuclear , and each vial was vortexed. Samples were kept at room temperature overnight before determination of radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Binding was calculated as fmoles of 3H spiroperidol bound per milligram of protein. Controls vehicle or 10 7 M l butaclamol , blank 10 7 M d butaclamol and inhibitor solutions four concentrations were run in triplicate.The concentration that reduced binding by 50 IC50 was estimated on semilog paper. The IC50 values in Table I represent means of two or three runs. Insoluble drugs were dissolved in ethanol 1 2 ethanol in final incubation mixture . As illustrated in Table I, this intrinsic method shows that the compounds of the present invention have excellent neuroleptic activity. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples. However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific details of these examples.
