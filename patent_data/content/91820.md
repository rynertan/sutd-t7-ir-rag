## Description
This invention relates to aqueous compositions containing perfluorocyclocarbons having particular utility as artificial blood and other gas transport agents. A number of years ago, the oxygen carrying capacity and lack of toxicity of perfluorinated liquids were reported. Emulsions of fluorocarbon liquids were also used as artificial bloods. In brief, over nearly the last 20 years, considerable work has been accomplished in connection with the use of fluorocarbons and fluorocarbon emulsions as oxygen transfer agents and as artificial bloods. Artificial bloods are now being commercialised, particularly in countries where the requirements for their use and commercialisation are not as involved as they are in the United States of America. It is inevitable that artificial blood will be commercialised and used throughout the world because of the significant need for such oxygen transport agents and the advantages of such agents over natural blood. US A 3,911,138 sets forth the various advantages and needs for artificial blood and may be referred to as further background of this invention. In this prior patent, artificial bloods containing perfluorocyclocarbons were disclosed as useful blood substituents. Emulsions containing emulsified particles of the perfluorocyclocarbons were also infused intravenously into experimental animals and functioned as oxygen carbon dioxide carrying agents intravascularly. Furthermore, the perfluorocyclocarbons surprisingly were found to be excreted from the animal body through the tissue, particularly the lungs and skin. The perfluorocyclocarbons disclosed in US A 3,911,138 were referred to as RES phobic, which indicatcd that the perfluorocyclocarbons exhibited a unique property of temporary sequestration by the liver or spleen and subsequent elimination by the animal body. It was later disclosed in US A 4,105,798 that certain other perfluoro polycyclic compounds were useful as synthetic blood and perfusion media. The perfluorinated polycyclic compounds disclosed in this patent are known generally as bicyclononanes and adamantanes. Bicyclononanes and adamantanes were found to have a high oxygen solubility, very low body residue, formed very stable emulsions and had a very satisfactory vapour pressure enabling them to be excellent candidates for blood substitutes and perfusion compounds. Thus, emulsions made from perfluorocyclo compounds such as perfluorodecalin have been found useful as blood substitutes because the cyclic fluorocarbon is transpired by the body though the skin and the lungs. However, in order for these emulsions to be preferred for biological use, they must be freshly prepared because they are not stable. That is, they tend to increase in opacity and the particle size of the fluorocarbon liquid increases rather rapidly with time. This process can be slowed by cooling or even by freezing. Whereas perfluorinated organic amines such as perfluorotributylamine or perfluorotripropylamine will make emulsions having good stability, it is known that such compounds tend to reside in the body, for example the liver or spleen, for considerable periods of time in comparison to the perfluorocyclo compounds such as perfluorodecalin. Recently, therefore, perfluorodecalin and perfluorinated amines such as perfluorotripropylamine have been combined in order to provide an emulsion which has increased stability and which would leave the body at a reasonable rate. Nevertheless, it has been observed that such perfluoroamines as tripropylamine tend to leave the body only very slowly and still such emulsions must also be kept cold or even frozen. Thus, while these compositions attempt to combine perhaps the best properties of both the fluorocarbons employed, namely, perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine, there are still problems that remain. Nevertheless, these preparations have been employed fairly widely in human beings in life saving procedures and have been proven to be very useful. Therefore, these advances, together with considerable research to date serve to emphasize that highly fluorinated organic compounds in the form of emulsions are very useful in supporting life when used in place of whole blood. The stability of an emulsion particle in a fluorochemical emulsion has great importance in the sense that the greater the stability, the longer the emulsion can be safely stored before it is used US A 3,778,381 and its counterpart discloses DE A 2,319,971 aqueous microemulsions, useful as artificial blood substitutes, which comprise certain fluorohalocarbons and, as surfactants in the preparation of the microemulsions, fluorinated amine oxides of the formula US A 3,828,085 also discloses aqueous artificial blood compositions containing perfluorinated hydrocarbons in which fluorinated amine oxides are used, as surfactants, to emulsify the perfluorinated hydrocarbon component. Finally, JP A 80 147218 discloses artificial blood compositions formed by emulsifying perfluorodecalins containing from 9 to 11 carbon atoms with a fluorinated amine oxide of the formula. We have now found, in accordance with the present invention, that highly stable aqueous gas transport agents, useful as blood substitutes for example, can be formed from two very specific classes of fluorinated hydrocarbons using organoamine oxide surfactants. The two classes of fluorinated hydrocarbons used in the present invention are as follows It will be appreciated that these two classes of compounds are not mutually exclusive but rather that certain compounds can fall into both classes. Thus, in one aspect the present invention provides a gas transport agent liquid composition comprising water, a perfluorocyclocarbon and an organoamine oxide, characterized in that said perfluorocyclocarbon is a non aromatizable perfluorinated polycyclic compound having 9 18 carbon atoms and at least two bridgehead carbon atoms linked through a bridge containing at least one carbon atom. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a gas transport agent liquid composition comprising water, a perfluorocyclocarbon and an organoamine oxide, characterized in that said perfluorocyclocarbon is a polycyclic perfluorocarbon containing at least 12 carbon atoms. As indicated above, the first class of perfluorocyclocarbons used herein are non aromatizable perfluorinated polycyclic compounds having 9 18 carbon atoms and at least two bridgehead carbon atoms linked through a bridge containing at least one carbon atom. As disclosed in US A 4,105,798, the term bridgehead carbon atom refers to a carbon atom bonded to three other carbons in a cyclic compound having two or more rings whilst the term non aromatizable refers to a polycyclic perfluoro compound whose ring structure cannot be aromatized without destruction of its original carbon to carbon cyclic bonds. Thus, the perfluoro compounds of this first class are to be distinguished from the perfluorodecalins used in JP A 80 147218, for example, which can be aromatized. In accordance with this invention, room temperature stable mixtures of the perfluorocyclocarbons and water have been obtained by the incorporation of an organoamine oxide as a surfactant or solubilizing agent. Even room temperature stable emulsions or solutions have been prepared which have the property of transparency. While these mixtures may either be considered a solution, a micellar solution, microemulsion, vesicular suspension, emulsion or a mixture of all of these physical states, it nevertheless has been demonstrated that in preferred embodiments of this invention such liquids are room temperature stable for extended periods of time. It has also been found that astonishingly large concentrations of the perfluorocyclocarbons are obtained in aqueous solutions or emulsions, even up to concentrations of 50 or more perfluorocyclocarbon by volume or 95 by weight in water. The combination of the perfluorocarbon and organoamine oxide surfactant or solubilizing agent seems to synergistically behave in water. In the past, usually 10 or 20 or at most 30 by volume perfluorocarbon liquids were considered to be concentrated emulsions. Moreover, the concentrated emulsions or solutions of this invention even have room temperature stability without any visible change for many months. Nearly transparent or transparent emulsions or solutions of perfluorinated compounds in water have also been surprisingly obtained. Such transparency has been achieved with very little sonication and such solutions or emulsions have room temperature stability for many months. Compositions of this invention offer excellent properties as oxygen transport agents. They are relatively non toxic and non hemolytic which renders them suitable for use as artificial bloods. Even though considerable amounts of perfluorocarbon may be concentrated in water, it has been found that the viscosities of the resultant fluids are very satisfactory for use as artificial bloods. The viscosities are near the viscosity of water. Furthermore, it has been discovered that the mixture, i.e., emulsions or microemulsions or whatever the physical or chemical state thereof, would pass readily at low pressures through a 0.22 µm filter which indicates that they will traverse the capillaries of living tissue, thus, such discovery is significant for biological and medical applications. This technique can be used to sterilize the mixtures as well. In contrast, previously known emulsions would only partially pass through such a filter at high pressures and thus such emulsions must be autoclaved for sterilization. Upon infusion into animals, the emulsions or solutions function as oxygen transport agents. Furthermore, the perfluorocyclocarbons employed have been proven to leave the body and have RES phobic properties. The emulsifier itself is excreted by the kidney and not retained in the body. Previous experience with perfluorinated derivatives such as FC 47 has demonstrated that emulsions of about 10 to about 30 by volume would increase in viscosities as the concentrations increased. These emulsions would tend to have the consistency of honey at the higher concentrations. In comparison, even with concentrations on the order of 50 or more by volume of the present perfluorocyclocarbons, particularly DAWN , containing the amine oxide, tend to have viscosities approaching the viscosity of water. These results are remarkably surprising. In brief, these and other advantageous properties of the compositions and methods of this invention will be further understood with reference to the following detailed description. The gas transport agents or artificial blood compositions of this invention are liquids. The term liquids , as used herein, is a comprehensive designation including any components in a fluid. As stated above, the physical state of the liquids may vary and include solution, miscellar solution, microemulsion, vesicular suspension, emulsion, or mixtures of any of these. In certain preferred features, as developed above, transparent solutions, emulsions, microemulsions, mixtures or other states, have been surprisingly found to exist wherein the perfluorocarbon is mixed with water in the presence of an organoamine oxide surfactant or solubilising agent, as the case may be. The term perfluorocyclocarbon means a cyclic compound of carbon, whereas the term substituted derivatives thereof characterises substituted perfluorocyclocarbons with acyclic or alkyl side chains, preferably lower alkyl side chains. It should also be noted that the term perfluorocyclocarbon denotes substitution of all hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms chain or ring and any carbon side groups with fluorine. It is conceivable in the manufacture of such compounds that minor amounts of substantially fluorinated derivatives may be mixed with completely fluorinated compounds. This is permissible providing the lack of complete replacement of all hydrogens does not affect the essential characteristics of the liquid perfluorocarbons of this invention, particularly when the active hydrogens critically enhance the toxicity of the compounds when they are employed in oxygen transport agents in animals. Among the perfluorocyclocarbons which may be employed herein are perfluorobicyclo 4.3.0 nonane, perfluoroendotetrahydrodicyclopentadiene, perfluoroadamantane, perfluor oexo tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene, perfluorodimethylbicyclo 3.3.1. nonane, perfluoro 1 methyl adamantane, perfluorodecahydroacenaphthene, perfluorotrimethylbicyclo 3.3.1. nonane, perfluorotetradecahydrophenanthrene, perfluoro 1,3,5,7 tetramethyl adamantane, perfluorododecahydrofluorene, perfluoro 1,3 dimethyl adamantane and perfluoro 7 methylbicyclo 4.3.0. nonane. It is also to be understood that the fluorocarbons that are useful according to this invention may be generally termed perfluorocyclocarbons or perfluorocarbocyclic compounds or cyclic perfluorocarbons . The term used predominantly in this description is perfluorocyclocarbon however, the term cyclic perfluorocarbons or perfluorocarbocyclic compound are considered alternative expressions. The term polycyclic means a compound of carbon having two or more rings of carbon atoms, e.g. a bicyclic compound in the case of naphthalene or more than two rings in the case of phenanthrene. The carbon ring can be alkylated with a lower alkyl group or groups such as methyl or ethyl as in the case of perfluoro decahydrodimethylnaphthalene . Perfluorocyclocarbons of this invention may be formed of neat perfluorocarbon liquids or solids and often, due to their mode of manufacture, are mixtures of perfluorocyclocarbons. For instance, perfluoro 1,3 dimethyl adamantane is normally a solid but in mixture with perfluorotrimethylbicyclo 3.3.1 nonane a liquid is formed and this mixture is sometimes referred to simply herein as DAWN . The designation DAWN comprises these compounds in varying amounts or proportions as revealed by gas chromatography wherein a number of major and minor peaks are observed representing the isomers of pefluoro 1,3 dimethyl adamantane and perfluorotrimethylbicyclo 3.3.1. nonane. Gas chromatography results are exhibited later in TABLE II. Perfluorocyclo compounds suitable for use in this invention are disclosed in US A 3,911,138 and 4,105,798, mentioned above. The following TABLE I lists two presently preferred perfluorocarbon liquids. The above perfluorocarbons are capable of being synthesized by either well known, chemical or electrochemical processes. The chemical processes yield fairly pure substances of known structure, having well defined boiling points. Whereas the electrochemical processes tend to yield a mixture of isomers, the liquids have well defined boiling points. With respect to gas chromatography, each liquid is capable of being well defined by either the packed or capillary column procedure. The standard to define each compound in gas chromatography is prepared as follows 2 microlitres of neat liquid are added to 120 millilitres of air in a sealed bottle and allowed to vaporise producing a stock standard upon vaporisation, 120 microlitres of the vapour from the stock standard are added to another 120 millilitres of air in a sealed bottle producing the working standard the sample measured by the procedure is withdrawn from the working standard, thus, a typical sample will contain 16.7 pico litres of perfluorocarbon per millilitre of standard however, in the capillary column procedure, the sample is split into a ratio of 23 1, therefore, only 1 23 of the sample is actually measured. As indicated in Table II, the retention time is highly definitive of each liquid used in this invention. Moreover, the capillary procedure is more specific than the packed column procedure by defining additional characteristic peaks of each compound. Thus, a more precise definition of compounds can be had with the capillary column procedure. The above perfluorocarbons all have in common a high solubility for oxygen and carbon dioxide, inertness, and RES phobic properties, as developed above. One main property generic to the preference of the fluorocarbons according to this invention over the other fluoro containing compounds is their chemical structure rendering them RES phobic. As developed in the background of this invention, RES phobic fluorinated liquids tend to accummulate in the bodies of animals, principally in the liver, and to a lesser extent in the spleen and the kidneys but leave in an acceptable period of time. This is significant because such liquids will not become fixed indefinitely within the cells of an organ. A perfluorocyclocarbon or a mixture thereof is preferably employed having a vapour pressure within the range of 1.33 x 10² to 33.25 x 10² Pa 1 to 25 torrs at 35 The term organoamine oxide is a generic expression to define cyclic or acylic amine oxides and substituted derivatives thereof. The term organo is intended to cover in its broadest sense acyclic as well as carbocyclic organic moieties whether they contain within their structure other atoms such as oxygen, bromine or nitrogen, or have substituted groups or side chains. In a preferred aspect of this invention, the organoamine oxides are fluorinated or polyfluorinated organoamine oxides. Organoamine oxides of the broad class which may be suitable for use in this invention are described in a general way in US A 3,194,840 3,547,995 3,600,415 3,778,381 and 3,828,085. A detailed discussion of organoamine oxides or N oxides appears in the literature reference The Pharmacology and Biochemisty of N Oxides , Hereinafter this compound will be referred to sometimes as XMO10 . The invention will be further understood with reference to the following detailed Examples which illustrate its practice. Two grams of XMO10 were dissolved in 200 ml of sterile distilled water. Nine ml of this 1 w v XMO10 solution was added to 1 ml of DAWN fluorocarbon liquid and sonicated for 10 seconds using a Branson sonicator. The resultant solution was clear and transparent and had a slight pink or bluish cast in certain lights. A mouse with a weight of 25.6 grains was injected with 1 cc of DAWN XMO10 emulsion which is equivalent to a dose of 39.0 cc kg. The mouse remained in good health. One cc of the 1 XMO10 preparation of Example 1 was diluted with 9 cc of distilled water, thereby resulting in a concentration of 0.1 XMO10. One cc of DAWN was combined with 9 cc of the 0.1 XMO10 mixture. When 1 cc of the DAWN was added to the XMO10 mixture, one could not see any change in the layers. Whereupon, after sonicating for approximately 20 seconds, the emulsion was warm and cloudy. It reverted to a clear solution or emulsion when cooled. A mouse was injected with 1 cc intravascularly as in Example 1. Other emulsions prepared in the fashion as in Examples 1 and 2 were made and even after over one year the emulsions are still transparent, or nearly so, and do not appear to have changed chemically after being kept at room temperature. Furthermore, other mice that have been injected with doses on the order of those identified in Examples 1 and 2 were still in good health and showed only the slightest traces, if that, of fluorocarbons according to gas chromatographic with electron capture detection techniques which can measure as little as 2 x 10 ¹⁵ litres in samples of whole body transpired air. In comparison, of course, large amounts of other fluorocarbons such as F tributylamine and even measurable amounts of F tripropylamine still remain after one year. It has also been found that the emulsions of XMO10 and DAWN can be heated and cooled repeatedly with the emulsion becoming more transparent while cold and with the system completely reversible. Thus, this also demonstrates the stability of these unique emulsions. A series of 10 ml test tubes were set up containing 50 by volume of perfluorocarbon liquids identified in Table III hereinafter and 50 by volume of a 2 2 grams of XMO10 in 100 cc water water solution of XMO10. The mixtures were sonicated and the results are reported in the Table. With reference to Table III, with the exception of DAWN and XMO10, both of which have been identified above, the following perfluoro chemicals are identified perfluorotributylamine FC47 , perfluorodecalin PP5 , perfluoro 1 methyldecalin PP9 , perfluorotetrahydrofuran FC80 , perfluoroether PID CF₃ ₂CFOCF₂CF₂ ₂CF₂OCF CF₃ ₂ , perfluoroether PIID CF₃ ₂CFOCF₂ CF₂ ₆CF₂OCF CF₃ ₂ , perfluoropolymer E3 perfluoropolymer E4 octyl bromide octyl br , and perfluoroetherpolymer Fromblin Y 01 . Astonishingly, even with a concentration of 50 by volume perfluorocarbon liquid, the DAWN XMO10 liquid was a nearly transparent emulsion or solution which was obtained almost without any sonication. The DAWN XMO10 preferred composition of this invention remained without visible change for several months. All of the other perfluorocarbons tested according to Table III formed milky emulsions which were vastly different in apearance. Other emulsions or solutions of DAWN and XMO10 made at other times were also transparent and showed similar stabilities. The structure of XMO10 which was identified above was anaylsed to verify its chemical consitituents. The table of data which follows further illustrates the principles of this invention in comparison to other perfluorocarbons. The prefix F means perfluorinated. The fluorocarbon was by volume or weight where a solid was employed. The XMO10 was by weight volume of water as in the earlier examples. The optical density was determined at 540λ at room temperature. At the end of a brief sonication of about 10 90 seconds, an initial determination of optical density was made Min. and a later determination Max. was made after a number of days as indicated in TABLE IV. The other commercial designations have been identified above, as well as DAWN. The above tabulated data demonstrates quite clearly that extremely stable emulsions are prepared from the present perfluorocyclo derivatives in combination with an organoamine oxide and such stability exists for long periods of time in comparison to other perfluorocarbon liquids. Amounts of perfluorocarbon from about 10 to 50 and from about 1 to 10 XMO10 may be employed, and even as little as 1 to 2 to obtain substantially transparent mixtures. More particularly, the preferred DAWN composition exhibits a stability far exceeding the stability of any of the other perfluorocarbons tested. The compositions are relatively non toxic and non hemolytic. In connection with the measurement of optical density, it should be understood that optical density 2 minus the log of the transmission is commonly used in colourimetry because there is usually a linear relation between increasing optical density and increasing concentrations of a coloured substance. In the data above, it is a measurement of the opacity of the solution or emulsion, or whatever the state may be. The smaller a particle, the more transparent the solution, emulsion or microemulsion, as the case may be, until a point where it is so transparent that it cannot be distinguished from water, for instance. The term transmission is not used much but it is easier to understand in a way because at 100 transmission O.D. 2 log 100 2 2 0 the sample is water clear. If not completely transparent, the instrument is often set to read at 100 transmission and as colour or opacity like milk is increased, the transmission decreases until it reaches 0. At this point the optical density is 2 log of 0 2 0 2. To read the opacity of emulsions beyond this point, it is necessary to either dilute them or use a shorter light path than for instance a 1 cm light path. Because of the complications which may be introduced by dilution factors which may change particle size, it was preferred to use a shorter light path in determining the optical density. If a solution has an optical density of 1.7 in a 1 cm cell, it will have an optical density of 0.17 in a 0.1 cm cell. Hence, if 1.7 is measured in a 0.1 cm cell, the optical density by this method becomes 17. It is practical to use a light path down to 0.05 cm or even to 0.01 cm in routine work in the laboratory. Therefore, optical density measurements reported in TABLE IV above were made with varying light paths and the results were mathematically made comparable. The compositions of this invention are especially useful as stated above for artificial blood. However, they also have utility as other oxygen or gas transfer agents in the body and for treatment of various conditions such as ischemia, shock, heart attack, stroke, and other such conditions where oxygenating the tissue is important. Further in the broadest sense, other uses will become apparent for these liquids as gas transfer agents in view of their high solubility for oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases. Furthermore, the capability of the perfluorocarbons employed above as gas transport agents in animals may be further understood by reference to the above patents cited in the description.
