# Engine cooling system control apparatus.

## Abstract
A cooling system control apparatus includes an electro nic control unit 18 to individually control the operation of an engine water pump 10 , a radiator fan motor 6a and an electromagnetic valve 11 for bypassing the cooling water passage to the radiator 5 , on the basis of a cooling water temperature. When the cooling water temperature is below about 85 C, the water pump 10 is stopped to raise the cooling water temperature rapidly, and when the cooling water temperature is above about 85 C, the water pump 10 is operated and the electromagnetic valve 11 is operated to bypass the cooling water passage to the radiator 5 , and when the cooling water temperature is above about 90 C, the fan motor 6a is operated and also the electromagnetic valve 11 is operated to allow the cooling water to pass through the radiator 5 .
