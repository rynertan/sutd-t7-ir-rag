The compounds of the invention may be prepared in various ways, for example by the process outlined in SchemeA belowScheme AEMI13.1 In Scheme A, the symbols R and X have the meanings previously assigned to them. The carboxylic acids II required as starting materials are known compounds. The other reactants RH are also in general knowncompounds or, where new in themselves, may be prepared by methods known for the preparation of the analogous known compounds.According to Scheme A, a carboxylic acid II is treated with thionyl chloride to convert it to the acid chloride III . Usually the reaction may be carried out by heating the carboxylic acid II under reflux with excess of thionyl chloride and removing the excess of thionyl chloride under reduced pressure when reaction is complete.The acid is then reacted with the compound RH, preferably in a solvent or diluent inert towards the reactants, and preferably in the presence of an acid acceptor. Depending upon the particular reactant RH chosen for use, the reaction mixture may be heated to accelerate the reaction, for example to a temperature in the range from 30 130 C or above. In some cases, it may be desirable to cool the reaction mixture at the start in order to moderate a vigorous exothermic reaction. The solvent or diluent may be for example a liquid hydrocarbon, for example diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran or a ketone, for example methyl ethyl ketone. Other solvents and diluents will be known to those skilled in the art the choice of solvent or diluent is not critical. The acid acceptor is preferably present in at least an equimolar amount with respect to the reactants. Examples of acid acceptors include tertiary amines, for example pyridine, dimethylaniline, and triethylamine and inorganic bases, for example sodium or potassium carbonate. The product may be isolated from the reaction by conventional methods. An alternative method of preparing the compounds of the invention is outlined in Scheme B below Scheme BEMI14.1 EMI15.1 According to Scheme B, the carboxylic acid IV is converted to the corresponding acid chloride V as described in Scheme A. The acid chloride is then reacted with the appropriate intermediate RH also as described inScheme A. The product VI so obtained is then converted to the required compound I by nitration or chlorination.Thus, where X is to be a nitro group, the diphenyl ether VI is treated with a nitrating agent, for example a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, or potassium nitrate sulphuric acid. Where X is to be chlorine, the diphenyl ether VI is treated with a chlorinating agent for example, the diphenyl ether may be dissolved in a solvent eg. glacial acetic acid and treated with gaseous chlorine. In either case the required compound I is isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional methods. Compounds of the invention wherein R is NS1S2 may also be prepared in a variety of ways. A process for preparing compounds in which S1 is hydrogen and s2 is a groupEMI15.2 outlined in Scheme C below Scheme CEMI16.1 The aminesEMI16.2 are in general known compounds.According to Scheme C, an acid chloride II is reacted with such an amine, preferably in a solvent or diluent inert towards the reactants, and preferably in the presence of an acid acceptor. Depending upon the particular reactants chosen for use, the reaction mixture may be heated to accelerate the reaction, for example to a temperature in the range from 30 130 C or above. In some cases, it may be desirable to cool the reaction mixture at the start in order to moderate a vigorous exothermic reaction. The solvent or diluent may be for example a liquid hydrocarbon, for example diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran or a ketone, for example methyl ethyl ketone. Other solvents and diluents will be known to those skilled in the art the choice of solvent or diluent is not critical. The acid acceptor is preferably present in at least an equimolar amount with respect to the reactants.Examples of acid acceptors include tertiary amines, for example pyridine, dimethylaniline, and triethylamine and inorganic bases, for example sodium or potassium carbonate. The product may be isolated from the reaction by conventional methods. Compounds of the invention wherein S1 is an agriculturally acceptable cation may be prepared from compounds of formula VII by treatment of the latter with an equimolar amount of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or carbonate, or with ammonium hydroxide or a substituted ammonium hydroxide. Compounds of the invention wherein S1 is a chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom may be prepared by reacting an alkali metal hypohalite eg. a sodium hypohalite for example sodium hypochlorite with a compound of the formula VII . The reaction is generally carried out in aqueous or aqueous organic solution or suspension, in the presence of a water miscible solvent such as an alcohol or ketone, for example methanol, ethanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone. The reaction is generally carried out at a temperature from 10 to 60 C preferably from 10 to 40 C. The concentration of starting material in the reaction medium is preferably from 0.5 to 30 by weight, preferably from 2 to 10 . The amount of hypohalite used is generally from 1 to 3 times the stoichiometric amount. Compounds according to the invention wherein S1 is hydrogen and s2 is a groupEMI17.1 may be prepared for example by the process outlined in Scheme D.Scheme DEMI17.2 EMI18.1 The substituted benzamide derivatives VIII used inScheme D are either known compounds or can be prepared by standard methods from the corresponding known carboxylic acids. In stage a of Scheme D, a substituted benzamide VIII is reacted with oxalyl chloride to give an acid chloride IX , preferably in a solvent or diluent inert toward the reactants. The reaction is preferably accelerated by heating, for example to a temperature in the range from 50 to 120 . The acid chloride derivative, after removal of the solvent, is then reacted with an alcohol or phenol S30H to give the carbamate derivative X .Conveniently this may be done by heating the acid chloride IX with an excess of the alcohol or phenol, for example at a temperature in the range from 50 to 100e or more, the excess of the reactant S30H acting as a solvent. The compounds X may be converted into salts by reaction with an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or carbonate or with ammonium or substituted ammonium cation as described above. The N chloro, bromo, or iodo derivatives may also be prepared as described above. In the above schemes, the substituent X is shown as being present throughout the reaction sequence however, in alternative processes, the X substituent is introduced by nitration or chlorination as the last step of the process,X being hydrogen in the intermediates.
