# Fluidized bed reactor for purification of waste water.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a one unit fluidized bed reactor for pu rification of waste water by means of biomass attached to car rier particles, comprising above the bottom of the reaction space a liquid distribution device 2 , suited in particular for in troduction of waste water in wide reactors achieving uniform fluidisation therein, consisting of a number of substantially hor izontal pipes each of them having in the under surface a num ber of regularly distributed openings for downward introduc tion of the liquid, and on top of the reaction space 1 united therewith a multifunctional separation compartment 3 for complete separation of the gas liquid solids mixture leaving the reactions space and for complete return of attached bio mass into the reaction space. The separation compartment is construction wise adaptable to treatments involving large or small gas fractions in reactors of varying width. The reactors are particularly suited for biological processes involving com plete and firm attachment of biomass to carrier without undue surplus accretion of biomass.
