## Description
This invention relates to a mowing machine comprisinga plurality of rotary cutting units mounted to a mainframe so as to be drivable about upwardly extending axes,wherein a the main frame extends, during operation of themachine, transverse to the operative travel A of themachine and comprises at least one driving unit having ahousing, b said driving unit supports at least one cuttingunit and drive means therefore, and c the driving unit comprisesa releasable shoe, extending forwardly, with respectto the normal direction of operative travel of the machine,along the bottom of the driving unit to its front side,protecting means being situated in front of the driving unit,below the cutting unit, the protecting means and the frontside of the shoe being rigidly secured together, wherein thereleasable shoe is mounted, with respect to the normaldirection of operative travel of the machine, to the rearside of the driving unit and is extending from the rear sideof the driving unit to its frontside, and in that the protectingmeans and the front side of the shoe are fitted aroundand over the forwardly protruding leading edge of the housingof the driving unit and the shoe is curved upwardly behindthe rear wall of the driving unit and is fastened only at thesaid rear wall thereto by two bolts, such that the shape ofthe shoe generally follows the form of the front, underneathand rear surfaces of the housing of the driving unit and thatonly the shoe is merely hooked around the leading edge. Before the priority date of the invention a mowingmachine manufactured by P.J. Zweegers en Zonen LandbouwmachinefabriekenB.V. of the type FALAZET 185 was sold. Saidmowing machine was provided with a releasable shoe. Saidreleasable shoe is mounted, with respect to the normaldirection of operative travel of the machine, to the rearside of the driving unit and is extending from the rear side of the driving unit to its frontside and the protecting meansand the front side of the shoe are fitted around and over theforwardly protruding leading edge of the housing of thedriving unit. This known machine had the disadvantage that theconnection of the shoes to the driving unit can come intocontact with obstacles on the ground, owing to which thisconnection can be damaged and weared. The aim of the invention is to improve this machineand according to the invention the shoe is curved upwardlybehind the rear wall of the driving unit and is fastened onlyat the said rear wall thereto by two bolts, such that theshape of the shoe generally follows the form of the front,underneath and rear surfaces of the housing of the drivingunit. The GB A 2 059 236 shows a protecting means protectingthe respective cutting unit from the lower sidethereof being formed, relative to the normal direction ofoperative travel of the machine, at the front side of thedriving unit. A shoe being bolted to the rear side of thedriving unit and is extending forwardly along the bottom ofthe driving unit to the front side thereof to be fittedaround a tie member connecting the driving units together. Inthis known construction the driving units are large andrelatively complicated as the protecting means are part ofthe driving units. Also here the connection of the shoes tothe tie member below the top front side of the driving unitcan come into contact with obstacles on the ground, owing towhich this connection can be damaged and weared. The DE A 2 825 665 shows a known constructionwhereby the frame beam is constructed of two angled plates,the upper of which is provided with forwardly extending partsforming protecting means for the respective cutting unit.Shoes are provided to the lower side of the frame beam, whichshoes are connected with bolt means to the lower side of theprotecting means. Also in this known construction the protectingmeans are part of the frame beam making the samewider and more complicated to fabricate. The bolt meansconnecting the shoes to the lower sides of the front ends of the protecting means can also easily be damaged and wear,during operation of the machine, by meeting obstacles andother members on the ground. For a better understanding of the present inventionand to show how it may be carried into effect,reference will now be made, by way of example,to the accompanying drawings, in which, The mowing machine shown in Figure 1 comprisesa fastening trestle 3 which is hitched to athree point lifting device 1 of a tractor 2. At therear, the trestle 3 carries an intermediate frame 4,which is pivotable with respect to the trestle 3about a substantially horizontal pivotal axis 5extending in the intended direction of operativetravel of the machine, as indicated by an arrow Ain Figures 1, 2 and 9. In the illustrated embodiment,the axis 5 lies substantially in the vertical,longitudinal central plane of the tractor 2. Theintermediate frame 4 extends away from the axis5 transversely of the direction A to a positionsubstantially level with a lateral boundary face ofthe tractor 2. A main frame 6 is connected to the end of theintermediate frame 4 away from the pivotal axis 5and is pivotable with respect to the intermediateframe 4 about a pivotal axis 7. The axis 7 isparallel to the axis 5 and is located just within thelateral boundary of the tractor 2. Viewed on plan,the main frame 6 is in line with the intermediateframe 4 and thus also extends transversely of thedirection A. In the illustrated embodiment the main frame 6carries six cutting units 8, which are drivable inrotation about upwardly directed rotary axes 9. The rotary axes 9 may be vertical, but preferablythey are tilted slightly forwards, with respect tothe direction A, from bottom to top. Each cuttingunit 8 is provided with one or more outwardlyextending cutters 10. The tip of a cutter 10 of thecutting unit nearest the intermediate frame 4described a circle which extends substantially upto the nearest boundary face of the tractor 2, thatboundary face being parallel to the direction A. The intermediate frame 4 and the main frame 6are pivotable with respect to the trestle 3 about anupwardly directerd pivotal axis 11 which liessubstantially in the vertical longitudinal centralplane of the tractor 2 and which provides theconnection between the intermediate frame 4 andthe trestle 3. In normal operation, pivoting aboutthe axis 11 is prevented by an overloadmechanism 12 which is arranged at a distancefrom the central longitudinal plane of the tractorand connects the intermediate frame 4 to thetrestle 3. A framework 13 extends over the main frame 6.Flexible walls are suspended from the peripheryof the framework 13 and extend to the ground to theprotect bystanders against objects such as stoneswhich might be thrown up by the cutting units 8. The mowing machine has an input shaft whichis journalled in a sleeve 15 and which can beconnected to the power take off shaft of thetractor 2 by an auxiliary shaft 14. The sleeve 15 isrigidly secured to the intermediate frame 4 andextends substantially horizontal in the direction A.The axis of the input shaft 16 coincides with thepivotal axis 5. The input shaft 16 projects from therear end of the sleeve 15 and the projectingportion carries a pulley 17. Near the end of theintermediate frame 4 adjacent the main frame 6there is a pulley 18 which is mounted on a shaft 19journalled in lugs 20 and 21 provided on theintermediate frame 4 and in a gear box 22. Thegear box 22 is pivotable with respect to the lugs20 and 21 and is rigidly secured to the main frame6. The axis of the shaft 19 coincides with thepivotal axis 7. The pulley 17 is drivably connected separateto the pulley 18 by means of one or more V belts23 running around the two pulleys. The diameterof the pulley 17 is larger for example three timeslarger than the diameter of the pulley 18. Theshaft 19 carrying the pulley 18 is provided with abevel gear wheel 24 Figure 4 , which mesheswith a bevel gear wheel 25, whose rotary axis,which is substantially horizontal during operation,intersects the pivotal axis 7 at right angles.The gear wheel 25 is journalled in a substantiallyvertical gear box 26, which is rigidly secured tothe gear box 22. The shaft of the bevel gear wheel25 is provided with a gear wheel 27 which islocated inside the gear box 26 and meshes withan intermediate gear wheel 28 disposed below it.The intermediate gear wheel 28 meshes with agear wheel 29 disposed beneath it. The rotaryaxes of the gear wheels 27, 28 and 29, which areall spur gears, are parallel to one another andlocated vertically one above the other. The diameterof the bevel gear wheel 24 is significantly larger than the diameter of the bevel gear wheels25, and the substantially equal diameters of thegear wheels 27 and 29 are considerably largerthan the diameter of the lower gear wheel 29. Thegear box 26 has at the bottom an outwardlyprojecting collar 30 Figure 4 , which surroundsthe shaft of the gear wheel 29 extending in thesame direction. The outwardly directed end partof the shaft of the gear wheel 29 is provided withaxial splines co operating with further axial splineson the inside of a sleeve 31 which fits over theprotruding shaft portion of the gear wheel 29 andis located inside the collar 30. The end of thesleeve 31 facing the gear wheel 29 abuts a bearing32A which is located between the sleeve 31 andthe gear wheel 29 and is one of the bearingssupporting the gear wheel 29. The end of thesleeve 31 away from the bearing 32A projectsbeyond the outer end of the shaft bearing the gearwheel 29. The sleeve 31 is surrounded by part of atie piece 32 having a bore, opening towards thegear wheel 29, which grips the sleeve 31. This partof the tie piece 32 is rotationally connected withthe sleeve 31 in a manner not shown, forexample, by means of splines. The part of the tiepiece 32 away from the gear wheel 29 is alsoshaped as a sleeve, but with a smaller diametraldimension. This part defines an outwardly openingrecess having a square transverse cross section.This square recess opens into the bore ata shoulder 33. Before slipping the tie piece 32onto the sleeve 31, a supporting plate 34 isdisposed on the shoulder 33, so that this plate 34is clamped between the sleeve 31 and theshoulder 33. The main frame 6 is clamped to the collar 30 ina manner to be described more fully later, andextends outwardly away from the collar. Before describing in detail the construction andassembly of the main frame, the associated drivingunits and the cutting units, the general structureof the main frame will be discussed. Themain frame 6 is made up of a sequence ofseparate parts comprising beginning at the collar30 a separate intermediate piece 35 Figure 4 , aseparate driving unit 36 comprising a rotatablepart at the top forming the cutting unit 8 , anintermediate piece 35, another driving unit 36 again comprising a rotatable cutting unit 8 , anintermediate piece 35 and so on. The outermostpart in this sequence is a driving unit terminatedby an end piece to be described more fully later.The intermediate pieces 35 are separate partswhich may have identical shapes and dimensionsto each other. As viewed in the direction B Figure4 or in the opposite direction, the end faces of theintermediate pieces 35 all have the same shapeand dimensions. The lengths of the intermediatepieces 35 measured in the direction B may be thesame for all of the intermediate pieces, but theycan alternatively be wholly or partly different.Basically the driving units 36 are identical. Thisalso applies to the cutting units 8 provided on thedriving units 36, but the lengths of the cutters 10may be different for different cutting elements. For the sake of clarity, Figure 8 is an elevationalview, in the direction opposite the direction B. Thesolid line part of Figure 8 applies to all of theintermediate pieces 35. The solid line part ofFigure 8 together with the broken line part appliesto an elevational view of a driving unit 36 takenopposite the direction B. The intermediate pieces35 and the housings of the driving units 36 aremade from, for example, cast iron. Figure 8 showsthat the lateral boundary faces of the intermediatepieces 35 and of the driving units 36 have threeholes 37, 38 and 39. These holes extend in thedirection B across the part concerned up to theother boundary face. The hole 37 serves toreceive a single main shaft 41 extending in thedirection B through all of the intermediate pieces35 and driving units 36. The hole 38 serves toreceive a tie member in the form of a tie rod 42which also extends through all of the intermediatepieces 35 and driving units 36. This tierod is heavily loaded in tension and is anchored atits ends on the inner and outer driving unit orintermediate piece respectively in the collar 30 sothat all driving units and intermediate pieces aresubjected to a compressive force parallel to thedirection B which is equal to the tensile force inthis tie rod. The hole 38 for receiving the tie rod is locatedapproximately at the middle of the dimension ofthe end face in the direction A so that thecompressive force exerted by the tie rod on theintermediate pieces and driving units act centrallyin order to avoid gaps between the intermediatepieces and the driving units and in order to obtainan assembly which is resistant to bending, whilstthe entire mating surface of each intermediatepiece and driving unit is uniformly loaded.On the side of the hole 38 away from the hole 37the end face of each intermediate piece anddriving unit has a hole 39. This hole 39 is importantin the manufacture of the castings for releasingthe cores of the castings. The wall thickness ofeach intermediate piece and driving unit is relativelysmall so that a large hollow space can beenclosed and the weight can be kept low, whilethe structural rigidity is sufficient. The generalform of the intermediate pieces and the housingsof the driving units, as viewed in the direction A,is shown in Figure 4. In the central region of eachintermediate piece 35 the vertical and transversedimensions are smaller than in the short regionsnear the adjacent driving units. In particular, it issignificant that the central region of the leadingedge of the intermediate piece 35 is set back fromthe end regions of the leading edge. The planview of Figure 2 indicates the distance 40measured in the direction A between the leadingedge of an intermediate piece 35 viewed on plan and the foremost boundary of the main drivingshaft 41 of the main frame. In order to maximizethe amount by which the central region of theleading edge of the intermediate piece is set backfrom the end regions, the dimension 40 is minimizedand is substantially equal to the wallthickness of the casting of the intermediate piece. Consequently, the leading edge is close to theopening for the main driving shaft. Thus, whenthe cutters of neighbouring driving units arerotating in opposite senses, as shown by way ofexample in Figure 2 sticking of crop cuttingswhich form in practice into a growing crust on theleading edge of a frame part in the region wherethe cutters of two adjacent driving units movebackwards can occur without being able toincrease forwardly to a point where the circlesdescribed by the outermost tips of the cuttersintersect, where the crust would adversely affectthe mowing operation. The dimension betweenthe leading edge of the intermediate piece and thepoint of intersection of the mowing circles is toolarge to be covered by the sticking crop cuttings,since the front portion of the crust is constantlybreaking off to an extent such that bridging thegap between the leading edge of the intermediatepiece and the point of intersection of the mowingcircles cannot occur. The tie rod 42 is shown in Figures 2 and 5. Thetie rod 42 extends through all of the intermediatepieces and driving units and comprises a seamless,drawn, thick walled tube. Alternatively adifferently shaped tube or solid rod may be used.At the inner end of the main frame 6 the tid rod 42is provided with a welded head 43 Figure 2 bearing on the surfaces of the gear box 26directed towards the intermediate frame 4. Asshown in Figure 4, the tie rod 42 is thus locatedbehind the axis of the gear wheel 29, with respectto the direction A. The two upwardly directedwalls of the gear box 26 have holes through whichthe tie rod 42 passes. From Figure 3 it will beappreciated that the outermost end of the tie rod42 has an internal screwthread receiving a bolt 44.The head of the bolt bears on the outer surface ofan end piece 45 in the form of a plate which is incontact with the outer end face of the outermostdriving unit 36. The length of the tie rod 42 is suchthat a small space is left between its outer endand the inner surface of the end piece 45. Bytightening the bolt 44 to a maximum torque of, forexample, 24 kgs m the tie rod 42 is placed undertension so that it exerts, through the end piece 45,a compressive force on the intermediate piecesand driving units. The end piece 45 extendsrearwardly and slopes inwardly Figure 3 toprovide a support for a swath board for definingthe outer edge of the mown swath of cropdeposited behind the machine in operation.Under the action of the compressive force appliedby the tie rod 42, the intermediate element 35located nearest to the gear box 26 bears, throughan intermediate ring, on the collar 30, whoseouter face matches the contacting face of theintermediate ring. Figure 6 shows one of the driving units 36clamped between two intermediate pieces 35 seethe side elevation of Figure 8 as a whole . Themain drive shaft 41 passing through all of theintermediate pieces 35 and driving units 36 is asolid shaft of non circular cross section. In theillustrated embodiment the shaft 41 has a square cross section, but it could alternatively be rectangular,hexagonal or circular with a flat side or akey way. The sides of the square cross section are12 mms long. In each driving unit 36 the shaft 41passes through a matching square hole in a bevelgear wheel 46, which meshes with a bevel gearwheel 47, the axes of these bevel gear wheelsintersecting each other at right angles. The gearwheel 46 has 16 teeth and the gear wheel 47 has33 teeth. A shaft 48 extends upwardly from thegear wheel 47 and has a cylindrical part 49 whichis in close contact with the cylindrical innerboundary of a hub 50 of the associated cuttingunit 8. The interface between the cylindrical portion49 and the inner wall of the hub 50 thusconstitutes a centering face for the position of thehub 50. A locking ring 51 is bolted to the castingforming the housing of the driving unit 36. Thelocking ring 51 is also a casting and has an L shapedradial cross section. The inner surface ofthe locking ring 51 is smoothly reamed andreceives two bearings 52 and 53 disposed oneabove the other. The inner races of the bearings52 and 53 support the outer surface of the lowerpart of the hub 50. The top part of the hub 50 has aflange extending over the upper bearing 52. Thetop surface of the flange serves as a supportingsurface for an annular cutter holder 54, whichslopes downwardly on all sides away from theouter periphery of the top part of the hub 50 andthen extends as a flat ring at right angles to thecentreline of the shaft 48. The flat ring carries, inthis embodiment two mowing cutters 10 disposeddiameterially opposite each other. Each ofthe cutters 10 is fastened to the cutter holder 54 ina pivotable manner by means of a bolt which isparallel to the centreline of the shaft 48. The innerperiphery of the upper and inner part of the cutterholder 54 defines a square hole which is a close fitover a raised part 55 of square shape, as viewedon plan, on the top surface of the hub 50. The shaft 48 comprises a splined portionlocated inside the hub 50 and above the cylindricalpart 49. The splines cooperate with furthersplines in the inner periphery of the hub 50.Above the splined portion the shaft 48 has ascrewthreaded portion 56. A cap 57 is fitted overthe screwthreaded portion 56 to secure the centralpart of the cutter holder 54. The cap 57 has arecess on the underside which receives thesquare raised part 55 of the hub 50. A nut 58 isscrewed onto the screwthreaded portion 56 toclamp the cap 57 to the cutter holder 24 and to thetop surface of the hub 50. The inner race of the lower bearing 53 bears ona shoulder 59 of the shaft 48, this shoulderconstituting a centering surface which is locateddirectly above the gear wheel 47 so that the lowerbearing 53 extends deeply into the housing of thedriving unit 36 so that the total height of thecutting unit can be limited, which is conducive tostability in operation. The gear wheel 46 is journalledin a bearing 60, the outer race of which issupported in the hole 37 of the casting forming the housing of the driving unit 36. On the side ofthe bearing 60 facing the adjacent intermediatepiece 35 there is a locating ring 61 which isarranged in the hole 37 and projects from the endface of the casting. Between the bearing 60 andthe locating ring 61 there is a Seeger ring circlip 62 located in a groove in the wall of the hole 37. Aseal 63, for example, formed by an O ring, isarranged between the outer race of the bearing 60and the boundary of the hole 37. As viewed inFigure 6 a bearing 60, an O ring 63, a Seeger ring circlip 62 and a locating ring 61 are provided in asimilar arrangement on the other side of thedriving unit 36. The gear wheel 46 is integral with a sleeve 64extending towards the bearing 60 further from thegear wheel 46, which bearing is axially supportedon a shoulder provided at the end of the sleeve64. The Seeger rings circlips 62 prevent thebearing 60 from moving outwardly of the drivingunit 36. The space around the gear wheels 46 and 47 arefilled with lubricant such as grease. The presenceof the sleeve 64 results in the grease filled part ofthe driving unit 36 being held within a closedspace so that the grease cannot penetrate to theinterior of the sleeve 64. Consequently, if the maindrive shaft 41 is removed and the driving unit 36is used as a separate unit, the grease cannot leavethe driving unit. In Figure 6, the gear wheel 46 is shown on theleft hand side of the axis 9 of the shaft 48. Thelocating ring 61 is a sliding fit allowing movementof the ring in the hole 36 so that, when the drivingunit 36 is used as a separate unit, the ring can bereadily removed. After the removal of the Seegerring circlip 62 the bearing 60 can also beremoved, since the bearing 60 is held in place bythe Seeger ring circlip and the sleeve 64 ratherthan by the fit of the bearing 60 in the housing ofthe driving unit. These conditions also apply tothe centering ring 61, the Seeger ring circlip 62and the bearing 60 on the right hand side inFigure 6. This means that the gear wheel 46 andthe sleeve 64 can be removed and replaced theother way round, the gear wheel 46 then being onthe right hand side, as viewed in Figure 6 so that itengages the opposite side of the gear wheel 47.When the main drive shaft 41 is driven in thesame direction as before, the cutting unit 8 isdriven in the opposite direction of rotation. Since the lubricant contained in the driving unit36 is confined in a closed space, it is necessary toprovide vent means shown in Figure 7. A holder65 is screwed into a tapped hole in the lockingring 51. The holder 65 has a bore communicatingwith the space around the gear wheels 46 and 47.The bore contains a compression spring 66. Onthe underside the compression spring 66 bears onthe top side of a plunger 67, the underside ofwhich bears on a shoulder in the continuous borein the holder 65. At the top the holder 65 has adiscontinuous collar 68 below which there is asecond discontinuous collar 69, which bears onthe locking ring 51 in the mounted state. The top end of the spring 66 is in contact with theunderside of a cap 70 of readily deformablematerial such as brass which is fined over theupper collar 68 and crimped, by means of pincers,in the region between the two collars 68 and 69.The cap 70 is crimped only on two opposite sides, theand consequently between the crimped parts thecap is slightly deformed outwardly so that anaperture is formed extending from the bore of theholder 65 along the discontinuous collar 68 to theregion between the two collars and thence to theopen air. The spring 66 normally holds the flap 67closed, but when heat is developed inside thedriving unit 36 the lubricant, which then tends toexpand, can lift the flap 67 and escape through anaperture 67A to the bore of the holder 65 andalong the path described above. The escapinglubricant is in general formed by a mixture of airand grease particles. After the cutter holder 54 isremoved, the holder 65 can be unscrewed and, ifnecessary, the driving unit may be replenishedwith grease through the opening thus formed. From Figures 2 and 8 it will be appreciated that,viewed in the direction of movement A, theleading edges of the tops of the driving units arelocated in front of the leading edges of theadjacent intermediate pieces 35. This is a consequenceof the shaft 48 of the cutting unit 8 ofeach of the driving units being placed as farforward as possible with respect to the neighbouringintermediate pieces in order to obtain, inthe opposite direction of rotation of the cuttingunits 8, an overlap of the cutters located as far aspossible in front of the leading edge of theadjacent intermediate piece 35. An additionalconsideration, as referred to above, is the effect ofa growth of a layer of crop cuttings settling on theleading edge of the intermediate piece. In Figure 2the leading edges of the top parts of the housingsof the driving units 36 protruding in front of theleading edges of the intermediate pieces aredesignated by reference numeral 71. Viewed onplan in Figure 2 the leading edge of each drivingunit is arcuate and subtends an angle of about150 or more in front of the leading edge of theadjacent intermediate piece. From the leadingedge 71, the front wall of each driving unit isinclined downwards from the front to rear andadjoins on the underside the underside of thedriving unit Figure 8 . Each driving unit 36 comprises a releasableshoe 72, the shape of which, in side view,generally follows the form of the front, underneathand rear surfaces of the housing of thedriving unit Figure 5 . The shoe 72 fits around theleading edge 71 of the driving unit and thenslopes downwards and rearwards subsequentlyit extends over the bottom face of the housingand curves upwardly behind the rear wall of thehousing. This shoe 72 is fastened to the housingonly at the rear by two bolts 73. The shoe 72 notonly provides a sliding and wear resistant surfacefor the driving unit the bottom face of eachadjacent intermediate piece 35 is located abovethe ground as can be seen, for example, from Figures 4 and 6 , but also enables a protectingplate 74 Figure 5 , to be rigidly secured to thefront of the shoe 72. The protective plate 74 isfastened at a distance of about 2 to 3 cms,preferably about 2.5 cms, below the outer edge ofthe cutter holder 54 and extends parallel to theouter edge of the cutter holder 54. The width ofthe protective plate 74, measured in the directionB Figure 4 , is substantially equal to that of thedriving unit and, viewed on plan, the outerboundary of the plate 74 approximately correspondswith that of the outer edge of the cutterholder 54. The plate 74 protects the cutting unit 8from stones and other objects which might otherwisepenetrate below the cutters 10 to the drivingunit and damage the cutting unit 8 by an upwardmovement. The main drive shaft 41 of the mower is madefrom a single length of material and extends fromthe collar 30 of the gear box 26 to the outer side ofthe outermost driving unit. This shaft is comparativelyvery thin and this thinness of the shaftappreciably contributes to the low value of thedimension 40 in Figure 2. The polar moment ofresistance of the main driving shaft 41 amount toabout 0.36 cm An important advantage of the comparativelythin main drive shaft 41 is that, during operation,this shaft can withstand an appreciable torsionaldeformation. With an overall length of the shaft41 of 165 cms the angular displacement betweenthe ends of the shaft is slightly more than 9 innormal operation. The total permissible angulardisplacement between the ends of the shaft isabout 46 before the yield point of the material isreached. The elasticity of the shaft 41 enables external forces exerted on the cutting units byimpact with obstacles such as stones and the liketo be absorbed without resulting in damage to the ofmachine. The safety factor up to the yield point ofthe shaft 41 is approximately 5. Also in the case ofa jolting start and running down of the rotatingcutting units the elasticity of the shaft 41 isimportant. As shown in Figure 6, each gear wheel 46 has acylindrical cavity 75 which opens to the outsideon the side facing the outer side of the drivingunit. The cylindrical wall of the cavity 75 has acontinuous groove 76. The cavity 75 and thegroove 76 are only used in the outermost drivingunit 46 as is shown in Figure 3. In this outermostdriving unit the gear wheel 46 is arranged on thatside of the driving unit which is furthest from thegear box 26, since the cutters 10 driven by thisdriving unit have to move inwardly at the front ofthe machine. The cavity 75 is, therefore, open tothe outside. The continuous groove 76 canreceive a Seeger ring circlip which provides astop in outward direction for the adjacent end ofthe main drive shaft 41. The inner end of the shaft41 is located by abutment with the supportingplate 34 mentioned above with reference to Figure4. In this way the shaft 41 is prevented frommoving axially except for a small clearance andit is retained axially by stops which rotate with theshaft so that they do not give rise to wear. The cutting unit 8 arranged on the outermostdriving unit 36 that is to say at the free end of themain frame 6 is preferably provided with adifferently shaped cutter holder 54 and hub 50,the cutter holder 54 measured in a vertical directionbeing appreciably higher than the cutterholders shown in Figures 4 and 6, that is to say,preferably 2 to 4 times higher than the cutterholders shown. The general design may be thesame, i.e. an upwardly converging truncatedcone. The reason for this is that the outermostcutter holder 54, the front side of which movesinwardly, contributes to the establishment of thelateral edge of the mown swath. The hub 50 isalso higher, whilst the same cap 57 can be used asin the other cutter holders. When viewed in a horizontal direction and inthe direction A Figures 4 and 6 , the top face ofeach intermediate piece 35 is located at a distance 1.5 to 2.5 cms below the bottom face of thelocking ring 51 of the adjacent driving units 36 inorder to minimize any hindrance of the passage ofmown crop to the rear over and across theintermediate pieces. The distance between thetop side of the part of the main drive shaft 41 ineach intermediate piece 35 and the top face of theintermediate piece itself is mainly occupied by thewall thickness of the intermediate piece 35. This isanother advantage of the small diameter of themain drive shaft 41 allowed by the comparativelyhigh speed of rotation of this shaft. As stated above the cutters 10 two of which areshown on each cutting unit 8 are arranged on the unitsouter, lower rim of the cutter holder 54 so as to be otherfreely pivotable at their inner ends about a pivotal axis parallel to the axis 9. The cutters 10 have atwisted form so that, with respect to the directionof rotation, the leading edge of each cutter is at alower level than the trailing edge. The mowing machine described may be assembledin various ways in accordance with the user sneeds. The intermediate pieces 35 and the drivingunits 36 on which the cutting units are or will bemounted are alternately mounted on the tie rod42, for example, first an intermediate piece 35,using the associated holes 8 through whichpasses the tie rod 42 , then a driving unit 36 alsousing the holes 38 , then another intermediatepiece 35, and so on until the desired number ofdriving units and cutting units 8 is attained. Thetubular tie rod 42 is preferably a close fit in theholes 36 Figures 5 and 8 , but this is not essential.In assembling the intermediate pieces and drivingunits the location of these components relative toeach other is ensured by the locating rings 61 Figure 6 each abutting the Seeger ring circlip 62 of the adjacent driving unit and abutting ashoulder in the adjacent intermediate piece. Sucha shoulder is also provided in the collar 30 of thegear box 26 Figure 4 . By means of these locatingrings 61 the relative positions of the intermediatepieces and the driving units as well as of the firstintermediate piece and the collar 30 areaccurately established. Since the contacting facesof the intermediate pieces and the driving unitsare smooth, relative rotation of these componentsmight occur, but this is prevented by the presenceof the draw rod 42 at a distance behind thelocating rings 61 and by the high compressiveforce exerted by the tie rod on the intermediatepieces and the driving units, this force beingsatisfactorily absorbed by the cast iron housingsof the intermediate pieces and driving units, it isadvisable to pass the main drive shaft 41beforehand through a number of intermediatepieces and driving units the end of the shaft 41may be bevelled to make its insertion easier. Theshaft 41 accurately fits in the square hole in eachgear wheel 46. In this way the flexible shaft 41 canbe readily passed through the intermediate piecesand driving units. A first possibility of varying the characteristicsof the mowing machine is to use intermediatepieces 35 of different lengths, measured in thedirection B. It is also possible to use intermediatepieces 35 of equal lengths and to vary the distancesbetween the driving units by arranging fillingpieces at the ends of the intermediate pieces. Inthis manner the distance between the rotary axes9 of the cutting units 8 can be varied. This may bedetermined by the choice of the directions ofrotation of neighbouring cutting units 8. Twoadjacent cutting elements having the same senseof rotation have cutters whose paths must notoverlap to any appreciable extent. If a standardlength of the cutter is used, the length of theintermediate piece located between the drivingunits concerned is chosen to be larger than inother cases. Alternatively, the length of the intermediatepiece may remain the same, but then shorter cutters must be used. When two adjacentdriving units rotate in opposite directions, thecutters can overlap considerably in accordancewith the desired local mowing effect. When thestandard length of the cutters of the last mentionedcutting elements is used a shorter intermediatepiece 35 may be used between the twodriving units, or, if comparatively long cutters areemployed, the intermediate piece can be of standardlength. Otherwise, if larger diameters ofsome or all cutting elements and larger diametersof the circles described by the cutter tips aredesired, longer intermediate pieces 35 have to beused so that higher cutting speeds of the cutterscan be attained. Then cutter holders 54 of largerdiameter are used in their central parts they havethe same square recesses receiving the squareelevated part 55. The later possibility thus providesa second variation in assembling the mowingmachine. It is also possible to select the direction ofrotation of each cutting unit 8. As stated abovewith reference to Figure 6 the gear wheel 46together with its integral sleeve 64 can be takenout of the driving unit 36 by removing the locatingring 61, the Seeger ring circlip 62 and thebearing 60. Figure 6 shows the gear wheel on theleft hand side of the housing of the driving unit this disposition determines the direction of rotation.When the removed parts 46 and 64 areinserted from the right hand side of the housingso that the gear wheel 46 engages the right handside of the gear wheel 47, the cutting unitmounted on the driving unit will be driven in theopposite direction of rotation. For this purposethe end of the sleeve 64 away from the gear wheel46 is moved to the right hand side of the housingof the driving unit and the shoulder like part iscaused to bear on the inner race of the bearing 60on the left hand side. Then on the right hand sidethe bearing 60 is inserted, to abut the shouldernear the cavity 75. Finally, the Seeger ring circlip 62 is inserted at the right hand side and thelocating ring 61 is fitted so as to locate theintermediate piece on the right hand side. Theseoperations are simple to carry out not only by themanufacturer of the machine but even by a dealeror the user himself. Of course driving units havingexisting dispositions of gear wheel 46 relative togear wheel 47 can be threaded in a different orderof succession onto the tie rod 42. The mowing machine described can thus bemodified to vary not only the distance betweenthe rotary axes of the cutting units but also thediameters of the circles described by the tips ofthe cutters and the relative directions of rotationof adjacent cutting units. When assembling themowing machine in the manner described aboveattention should, of course, be paid to the relativedirections of rotations of the cutters, as viewed onplan. The cutters of two adjacent cutting unitswill, in general, be disposed so that they are out ofphase by a right angle with respect to oneanother. It is important for the numbers of teeth ofthe gear wheels 46 and 47 of each driving unit to have a given ratio. The ratio between the numbersof teeth of the gear wheels 47 and 46 neednot be an integer, but should preferably beslightly higher or lower than an integer. In theembodiment described the gear wheel 47 has 33teeth and the gear wheel 46 has 16 teeth. When adriving unit is slipped from the right hand endonto the drive shaft 41 so fixing the squareelevated part 55 with respect to the length of theshaft 41 and subsequently an intermediate piece35 is mounted on the shaft, the shaft 48 of thenext driving unit can be turned by hand before itis slipped onto the shaft 41 until the square part55 and the square recess in the gear wheel 46have the same positions as those of the drivingunit already mounted. Owing to the aforesaidratio between the numbers of teeth of the gearwheels 46 and 47 a few turns of the shaft 48 willbe sufficient to cause both the square elevation 55and the square recess in the gear wheel 46 to bein the same positions as those of the driving unitalready mounted. Afterwards the cutter holder 54is fitted on the square part 55 in a manner suchthat the associated cutters are out of phase by aright angle with respect to those of the drivingunit slipped on previously. Apart from the aforesaid advantages of theintegral drive shaft 41, such a construction ispreferred over an assembly of shaft portions forother reasons. For example, the individual portionsof a composite shaft would have to becoupled together by coupling pieces for examplewith a splined connection between the shaftportions and the coupling pieces so that duringoperation due to the varying torsional moment inthe shaft the shaft portions tend to bite thecoupling pieces. Preferably the drive shaft 41 is subjected to asurface treatment to avoid corrosion of the shaftsurface otherwise the passage of the squarerecesses in the gear wheels 46 of the driving unitsover the shaft might become difficult. Such asurface treatment may be cadmium orchromium plating or the like. As viewed from the side Figure 8 the top faceof each intermediate piece 35 slopes upwardlyfrom front to rear see the dashed line 77representing the front portion of the top face andthe solid line 78 representing the rear portion thesolid line located above the dashed line 77represents an integrally cast ear of the castingnear the two ends of the intermediate piece 35, asis also shown, for example, in Figure 4 . Croppassing across the top face of the intermediatepiece to the rear, when the intermediate piece islocated, for example, between two cutting units 8rotating in opposite directions, is guided by theupward slope of the rear part 78 in upwardly andrearwardly inclined direction as a result of whichthe crop is airily deposited on the ground. Figure 9 schematically shows a number ofcutting units 8, which have been assembled in themanner described above to give a desiredsequence of the various relative distancesbetween the neighbouring rotary axes 9 and for the directions of rotation of the cutting units. Thethree cutting units on the left hand side of Figure9 all rotate in the same sense i.e. clockwise, whilethe three cutting units on the right hand side ofthe machine all rotate in the opposite direction e.g. anti clockwise. The mown crop is conveyed from the two endsof the row of cutting units towards the centre ofthe machine and is deposited to the rear over andacross the respective intermediate piece 35 in theform of a swath by two central cutting units whichrotate in opposite directions. In this embodimentall the mown crop is passed between only twocuffing units so that it is useful in this case for theintermediate piece arranged between the twocutting units driven in opposite senses to berelatively long compared with the other intermediatepieces 35, or for auxiliary pieces to beprovided. The embodiment shown in Figure 9 isonly given by way of example, and the relativedispositions may be different. For example, onthe left hand side there could be two cutting unitsrotating clockwise, the other four cutting unitsrotating anti clockwise, but many other combinationsof directions of rotation and relative distancesare also possible. In the embodiment shownin Figures 1 and 9 the mowing machine comprisessix cuffing units 8 each having a mowingcircle of 30 cms diameter, when rotating in thesame direction, and of 35 cms diameter whenrotating in opposite directions, the distancebetween the rotary axes 9 being about 30 cms andthe overall cutting width being 1.8 ms. The lengthof the main drive shaft 41 is in this case about 165cms. For two adjacent driving units 36 rotating inthe same direction, the distance between the gearwheels 46 is then, of course, also 30 cms. For twodriving units driven in opposite directions, thedistance between the associated gear wheels 46is about 38 cms, since the gear wheel 46 of one ofthe two driving units see Figure 6 is put at theright hand side of the driving unit in its mirror imageposition. This means that torsional deformationof the shaft length between the gearwheels 46 of the driving units driven in oppositesenses is greater and hence there is more resiliencethan between the units driven in the samesense so that jolting loads occurring particularlyin driving units driven in opposite directions as inthe middle of Figure 9 can be better absorbed. The mowing machine described is particularlysuitable for being hitched not only to the rear liftof a tractor but also to a front lift, in which casethe gear box 26 need only be arranged in a mirror imageposition with respect to a plane at rightangles to the plane of the drawing in Figure 4 particularly the collar 30 . A required change ofdirection of rotation of the cutting elements canbe carried out in the manner described above.The mowing machine is particularly intended tomow agricultural crop, for example, grass andclover.
