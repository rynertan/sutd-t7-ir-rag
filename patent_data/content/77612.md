# Connector arrangements.

## Abstract
The arrangement connects two liquid supply ducts 14,16 and at least two electrical leads 58,70 . The connector arrangement comprises two abuttable bodies 10,12 each having attachment means 18,20 to a liquid supply duct and connections 58,70 to the electrical leads and including a valve 22,38 to close the liquid supply ducts. The electrical connection is made by an elongate conductor 60 on one body entering a socket 68 in the other body, this connection being made before the liquid can flow from one body to another to prevent the possibility of arcing between the electrical connections igniting the liquid.
