# Pouring mechanism having an extensible pouring spout.

## Abstract
An improved pouring mechanism in a container for liquids, e.g., a can, has an extensible pouring spout 7 in the form of a tube which is movable in the axial direction in the orifice of a container neck 2 or pipe stub having external threads 3 for a screw cap 4 . The outlet of the tube 7 is provided with an outwardly directed abutting and sealing flange 8 , and the neck 2 on the container is provided with an inwardly directed, annu lar flange 6 . An inwardly directed flange 9 on the spout 7 is formed as a sealing lip which, when the container 1 is closed, cooperates with a central plug 10 inside the cap 4 . Said inwardly directed sealing lip 9 is adapted to engage with the internal plug 10 in the cap with a press fit sufficiently tight to permit the pouring spout 7 to be drawn outward through the container neck 2 when the cap 4 is unscrewed and lifted off, until protruding catch surfaces 13 on the spout encounter the inner face of the flange 6 in the neck.
