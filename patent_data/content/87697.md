# Multiple inverter.

## Abstract
A multiple inverter has an input shut off circuit 22 receiving a DC energy input and providing two DC outputs E221, E222 two unit inverters 24, 26 coupled to the input shut off circuit 22 , each including switching elements, for respectively converting the DC outputs E221, E222 into two AC outputs e24, e26 and a control circuit 28, 32 coupled to the unit inverters 24, 26 for detecting an accidental overcurrent IA1 or IA2 due to a shoot through of the switching elements, and turning off the unit inverters. The input shut off circuit 22 includes circuit elements for interrupting a current path of the DC energy input when the control circuit 28, 32 detects the accidental or faulty over current.
