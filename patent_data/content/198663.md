# Toner compositions.

## Abstract
An electrostatic toner composition having positive or negative charging for use in electrostatography comprised of resin particles, pigment particles, and a complex of a dipolar molecule or salt attached to an ionophoric polymer. Positive charging compositions are particularly useful in systems hav ing a Viton coated fuser roll because the additives do not react with the roll coating. Negatively charged compositions are particularly useful in colour imaging processes.
