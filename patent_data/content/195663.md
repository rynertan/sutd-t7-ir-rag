## Description
This invention relates to peroxygen bleaching compositions and processes therefor that provide effective surface bleaching of textiles over a wide range of temperatures. Surface bleaching of textiles is bleaching wherein the bleaching mechanism takes place on the textile surface, and, thereby, removes stains and or soils. The present invention relates to a bleaching composition comprising a compound which will provide in aqueous solution a peroxyacid of the general formula Preferred compounds which provide the above peroxyacid are the magnesium salts thereof. Such salts have the following general formula The peroxyacids may also be formed in situ from a peroxygen bleaching compound capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide and a bleach activator of the following formula Where the composition contains the bleach activator, another essential component is a peroxygen bleaching compound capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution. In a preferred embodiment, the bleaching compositions are incorporated into detergent compositions. The invention also relates to a process for bleaching textiles with one of the above described compounds. This invention relates to bleaching compositions comprising compounds which provide peroxyacids of the following formula The bleaching compositions of the invention provide bleaching over a wide range of solution temperatures. Bleaching is obtained in bleach solutions wherein the solution temperature is at least 5 C. The compounds providing the peroxyacids in the compositions of the invention may be synthesized from natural raw materials such as coconut extract which is predominently lauric acid. These compounds are essentially odor free as compared with shorter chain, more volatile homologues. Because of the low cost of the raw materials, the compounds are also more economical to use. The peroxyacid may be used directly as a bleaching agent in compositions of the invention under the proper conditions, as hereinafter defined. For improved stability, especially when incorporated into detergent compositions, the magnesium salt of the peroxyacid is preferred. Alternatively, a bleach activator may be employed with a peroxygen bleaching compound capable of releasing hydrogen peroxide. The magnesium salt has the following general formula In a preferred form, the magnesium salt is a hydrate of the following formula The magnesium compounds are solid and possess excellent storage stability, especially under alkaline conditions such as when admixed with a detergent composition. Stability means that the solid magnesium peroxycarboxylates retain the active oxygen during storage to a much greater extent than the corresponding peroxyacids. The active oxygen in the magnesium peroxycarboxylate is readily available. This means that the solid magnesium peroxycarboxylates are readily soluble or dispersible and yield solutions containing active oxygen. When the solution is aqueous, it cannot be distinguished from an aqueous solution prepared from the corresponding peroxyacid and an equivalent amount of magnesium, when the solutions are adjusted to the same pH. The magnesium peroxycarboxylates are safer than the corresponding peroxyacids both for handling purposes and to the substrate. Also the solid magnesium peroxycarboxylates have superior odor, dispersibility and handling properties relative to the corresponding peroxyacids. It is believed that the increased stability of the magnesium salt relative to the primary peroxyacid is due to the fact that the active oxygen atom is nucleophilic rather than electrophilic as it is in the corresponding peroxyacid. Nucleophilic agents which would attack an electrophilic oxygen are much more prevalent in bleaching and detergent compositions than electrophilic agents. The magnesium peroxycarboxylates are prepared via the process of U.S. Patent 4,483,781, Hartman, issued November 20, 1984, incorporated herein by reference. Hartman discloses magnesium salts of peroxyacids containing alkyl groups of from C₁ C₂₀. Contrary to the teachings of the prior art, however, the compounds of the C₁₀ C₁₅ chain length possess excellent bleach ing ability and are virtually free of malodor when used in compositions involving an ionic strength of no more than 0.05 The bleach activators within the invention have the following general formula The leaving group L should be electron withdrawing in order to increase the reactivity of the carbonyl moiety. L must be sufficiently reactive for the perhydrolysis, hereinafter defined, to occur within the optimum time frame e.g., a wash cycle . However, if L is too reactive the bleach activator will be difficult to stabilize for use in a bleaching or detergent composition. It is also important that L form a stable entity after leaving so that the back reaction will occur at a negligible rate. These attributes are generally paralleled by the pKa of the conjugate acid, HL, of the leaving group, L, although exceptions to this convention are known. Generally, suitable leaving groups possess pKa s of their conjugate acid in the range of from about 4 to about 13, preferably from about 7 to 11, and most preferably from about 8 to 11. L should also contain a water solubilizing group, Y, so that the dissolution of the bleach activator proceeds expeditiously. Preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R is as defined in the general formula and L is selected from the group consisting of Preferred bleach activators are also those of the above general formula wherein L is as defined in the general formula and R is an alkyl group containing about 11 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R is an alkyl group containing from about 10 to about 15 carbon atoms and L is selected from the group consisting of Especially preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R is a linear alkyl chain containing about 11 carbon atoms and L is selected from the group consisting of The most preferred bleach activators have the formula The bleaching compositions of the invention are those which, upon dissolution in aqueous solution, provide a bleaching com pound of the formula The bleaching compositions of the invention provide surface bleaching over a wide range of bleach solution temperatures. Such bleaching is obtained in bleach solutions wherein the solution temperature is at least about 5 C. Peroxygen bleaches would be ineffective and or impracticable at temperatures below about 60 C. Optimum surface bleaching performance is obtained with bleaching solutions wherein the pH of such solution is between about 8.5 and 11.0 and preferably between 9.5 and 10.5. It is preferred that such pH be greater than 9 to increase the concentration of perhydroxyl anion present. Such pH can be obtained with substances commonly known as buffering agents, which are optional components of the bleaching compositions herein. The bleaching mechanism generally, and the surface bleach ing mechanism in particular, are not completely understood. However, it is generally believed that the bleach activator under goes nucleophilic attack by a perhydroxyl anion, which is gen erated from the hydrogen peroxide evolved by the peroxygen bleach, to form a peroxycarboxylic acid. This reaction is com monly referred to as perhydrolysis. A second, less desirable reaction involves the formation of the less reactive diacyl peroxide. The latter reaction increases in consequence with the hydrophobicity of the R group. However, the extent of desirable surface bleaching also increases with the hydrophobicity of the R group. The generation of the less reactive diacyl peroxide can be minimized by increasing the amount of the perhydroxyl anion present in the bleaching solution. Since the perhydroxyl anion is the perhydrolysis agent, this accelerates the perhydrolysis of the bleach activator. The diacyl peroxide will also perhydrolize to regenerate the more reactive peroxyacid. This vastly increases the bleaching efficiency of the bleaching solution. The amount of perhydroxyl anion may be increased directly by adding more alkalinity to the bleaching solution. U.S. Patent 4,412,934, Chung et al issued November 1, 1983, incorporated herein by reference teaches that R groups of the length described C₁₀ C₁₅ will not form useful amounts of peroxyacids. Likewise, in A second mechanism for the generation of diacyl peroxide involves the combination of two peroxy acid molecules, as disclosed by J.F. Goodman Applicant has now surprisingly found that bleach activators of the invention wherein R is an alkyl chain with about 10 to about 15 carbon atoms will undergo perhydrolysis to form and maintain useful amounts of peroxyacids. This requires that the ionic strength of the solution be from about 0 to about 0.05 The bleaching compositions of the invention are substantially free of cationic surfactant, such as those described in U.S. Patent 4,222,905, Cockrell, issued September 6, 1980 and in U.S. Patent 4,239,659, Murphy, issued December 16, 1980, both incor porated herein by reference. Where cationic surfactants are present, they form less than 0.5 , preferably less than 0.2 by weight of the surfactant present. Inclusion of more than the stated limits of cationic surfactant results in excessive formation of the corresponding diacyl peroxide and attendant loss of bleaching performance. Without being bound by theory it is believed that diacyl peroxide formation, hereinabove described, tends to dominate when R is longer than about 10 carbon atoms and the ionic strength is greater than about 0.05 It is believed that the greater hydrophobic character of diacyl peroxides formed from the bleach activators and peroxyacids of this invention wherein R consists of a carbon chain of about 10 to about 15 carbon atoms accounts from this behavior. The lower homologous bleach activators and peroxyacids outside this invention are generally less affected by ionic strength or surfactant types. This is because the shorter R groups lead to more hydrophilic diacyl peroxides which remain accessible to the perhydroxyl anion even with higher levels of ionic strength and or cationic surfactants. Thus it can be seen that the bleach activator or peroxyacid wherein R is 15 would be more affected than wherein R is 11. Thus, for a bleach activator or peroxyacid wherein R is 15, a lower ionic strength is required than when R is 11. However, it is believed that any peroxyacid, or bleach activator capable of generating a surface active peroxyacid will have a maximum ionic strength above which inaccessible diacyl peroxide formation dominates. Appropriate design of the bleaching composition, as described herein, ameliorates this condition. The peroxygen bleaching compounds useful in the compositions containing bleach activators herein are those capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution. These compounds are well known in the art and include hydrogen peroxide and the alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxide bleach ing compounds such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalt bleaching compounds, such as the alkali metal perborates, percar bonates, perphosphates, and the like. Mixtures of two or more such bleaching compounds can also be used, if desired. Preferred peroxygen bleaching compounds include sodium perborate, commercially available in the form of mono , tri and tetra hydrate, sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate, sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrate, and sodium peroxide. Particularly preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate and, especially, sodium perborate monohydrate. Sodium perborate monohydrate is especially preferred because it is very stable during storage and yet still dissolves very quickly in the bleach ing solution. It is believed that such rapid dissolution results in the formation of higher levels of percarboxylic acid and, thus, enhanced surface bleaching performance. The level of peroxygen bleach within compositions of the invention is from about 0.1 to about 95 and preferably from about 1 to about 60 . When the bleaching compositions within the invention are also detergent compositions it is preferred that the level of peroxygen bleach is from about 1 to about 20 . The level of bleach activator within the compositions of the invention is from about 0.1 to about 60 and preferably from about 0.5 to about 40 . When the bleaching compositions within the invention are also detergent compositions it is preferred that the level of bleach activator is from about .1 to about 10 , and preferably 1 to about 6 . As a preferred embodiment, the bleaching compositions of the invention can be detergent compositions. Thus, the bleaching compositions can contain typical detergent composition components such as detergency surfactants and detergency builders. In such preferred embodiments the bleaching compositions are particularly effective, if the detergent composition has an ionic strength within the invention. The bleaching compositions of this invention can contain all of the usual components of detergent compositions including the ingredients set forth in U.S. Patent 3,936,537, Baskerville et al, incorporated herein by reference. Such components include color speckles, suds boosters, suds suppressors, antitarnish and or anticorrosion agents, soil suspending agents, soil release agents, dyes, fillers, optical brighteners, germicides, alkalinity sources, hydrotropes, antioxi dants, enzymes, enzyme stabilizing agents, perfumes, etc. The detergent surfactants can be any one or more surface active agents selected from anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic, ampho teric classes and compatible mixtures thereof. Detergent surfactants useful herein are listed in U.S. Patent 3,664,961, Norris, issued May 23, 1972, and in U.S. Patent 3,919,678, Laughlin et al, issued December 30, 1975, both incorporated herein by reference. The following are representative examples of detergent surfactants useful in the present compositions. Water soluble salts of the higher fatty acids, i.e., soaps , are useful anionic surfactants in the compositions herein. This includes alkali metal soaps such as the sodium, potassium, ammon ium, and alkanolammonium salts of higher fatty acids containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, and preferably from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. Soaps can be made by direct saponification of fats and oils or by the neutralization of free fatty acids.

Espec ially valuable are linear straight chain alkylbenzene sulfonates in which the average number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group is from about 11 to 13, abbreviated as C Other anionic surfactants herein are the sodium alkyl gly ceryl ether sulfonates, especially those ethers of higher alcohols derived from tallow and coconut oil sodium coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride sulfonates and sulfates sodium or potassium salts of alkyl phenol ethylene oxide ether sulfates containing from about 1 to about 10 units of ethylene oxide per molecule and wherein the alkyl groups contain from about 8 to about 12 carbon atoms and sodium or potassium salts of alkyl ethylene oxide ether sulfates containing about 1 to about 10 units of ethylene oxide per molecule and wherein the alkyl group contains from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms. Other useful anionic surfactants herein include the water soluble salts of esters of alpha sulfonated fatty acids containing from about 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the fatty acid group and from about 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the ester group water soluble salts of 2 acyloxyalkane 1 sulfonic acids containing from about 2 to 9 carbon atoms in the acyl group and from about 9 to about 23 carbon atoms in the alkane moiety water soluble salts of olefin and paraffin sulfonates containing from about 12 to 20 carbon atoms and beta alkyloxy alkane sulfonates containing from about 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and from about 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkan moiety. Water soluble nonionic surfactants are also useful in the compositions of the invention. Such nonionic materials include compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups hydrophilic in nature with an organic hydrophobic compound, which may be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature. The length of the polyoxyalkylene group which is condensed with any particular hydrophobic group can be readily adjusted to yield a water soluble compound having the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements. Suitable nonionic surfactants include the polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols, e.g., the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from about 6 to 15 carbon atoms, in either a straight chain or branched chain con figuration, with from about 3 to 12 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol. Preferred nonionics are the water soluble and water disper sible condensation products of aliphatic alcohols containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, in either straight chain or branched config uration, with from 3 to 12 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Particularly preferred are the condensation products of alcohols having an alkyl group containing from about 9 to 15 carbon atoms with from about 4 to 8 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Semi polar nonionic surfactants include water soluble amine oxides containing one alkyl moiety of from about 10 to 18 carbon atoms and two moieties selected from the group of alkyl and hydroxyalkyl moieties of from about 1 to about 3 carbon atoms water soluble phosphine oxides containing one alkyl moiety of about 10 to 18 carbon atoms and two moieties selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups and hydroxyalkyl groups con taining from about 1 to 3 carbon atoms and water soluble sulf oxides containing one alkyl moiety of from about 10 to 18 carbon atoms and a moiety selected from the group consisting of alkyl and hydroxyalkyl moieties of from about 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Ampholytic surfactants include derivatives of aliphatic or aliphatic derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines in which the aliphatic moiety can be straight chain or branched and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one aliphatic substituent con tains an anionic water solubilizing group. Zwitterionic surfactants include derivatives of aliphatic, quaternary, ammonium, phosphonium, and sulfonium compounds in which one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms. The compositions of the invention are substantially free of cationic surfactants, such as those desribed in U.S. Patent 4,222,905, Cockrell, issued September 6, 1980, and in U.S. Patent 4,239,659, Murphy, issued December 16, 1980 both incor porated herein by reference. Where cationic surfactants are included, they comprise no more than about 0.5 , and preferably no more than about 0.2 by weight of the total surfactant in the composition. Preferably, any cationic surfactant present is in the form of a separate body, wherein the cationic is separated from other compounds of the composition by encapsulation prior to addition. The level of detergent surfactant that can be employed is from 0 to about 50 , preferably from about 1 to about 30 and most preferably from about 10 to about 25 by weight of the total composition. In addition to detergent surfactants, detergency builders can be employed in the bleaching compositions. Water soluble inor ganic or organic electrolytes are suitable builders. The builder can also be water insoluble calcium ion exchange materials non limiting examples of suitable water soluble, inorganic detergent builders include alkali metal carbonates, borates, phosphates, bicarbonates and silicates. Specific examples of such salts include sodium and potassium tetraborates, bicarbonates, carbonates, orthophosphates, pyrophosphates, tripolyphosphates and meta phosphates. Examples of suitable organic alkaline detergency builders include 1 water soluble amino carboxylates and aminopolyace tates, for example, nitrilotriacetates, glycinates, ethylenediamine tetraacetates, N 2 hydroxyethyl nitrilo diacetates and diethyl enetriamine pentaacetates 2 water soluble salts of phytic acid, for example, sodium and potassium phytates 3 water soluble polyphosphonates, including sodium, potassium, and lithium salts of ethane 1 hydroxy 1, 1 diphosphonic acid sodium, potassium, and lithium salts of ethylene diphosphonic acid and the like 4 water soluble polycarboxylates such as the salts of lactic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, citric acid, carboxy methyloxysuccinic acid, 2 oxa 1,1,3 propane tricarboxylic acid, 1,1,2,2 ethane tetracarboxylic acid, mellitic acid and pyromellitic acid and 5 water soluble polyacetals as disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,144,266 and 4,246,495 incorporated herein by reference. Another type of detergency builder material useful in the present compositions comprises a water soluble material capable of forming a water insoluble reaction product with water hardness cations preferably in combination with a crystallization seed which is capable of providing growth sites for said reaction product. Such seeded builder compositions are fully disclosed in British Patent Specification No. 1,424,406. A further class of detergency builder materials useful in the present invention are insoluble sodium aluminosilicates, particu larly those described in Belgian Patent 814,874, issued November 12, 1974, incorporated herein by reference. This patent discloses and claims detergent compositions containing sodium aluminosili cates having the formula Na The level of detergency builder of the bleaching compositions is from 0 to about 70 , preferably from about 10 to about 60 and most preferably from about 20 to about 60 . Buffering agents can be utilized to maintain the desired alkaline pH of the bleaching solutions. Buffering agents include, but are not limited to many of the detergency builder compounds disclosed hereinbefore. Buffering agents suitable for use herein are those well known in the detergency art. Preferred optional ingredients include suds modifiers parti cularly those of suds suppressing types, exemplified by silicones, and silica silicone mixtures. U.S. Patents 3,933,672, issued January 20, 1976 to Bartolotta et al, and 4,136,045, issued January 23, 1979 to Gault et al, incorporated herein by reference, disclose silicone suds controlling agents. The silicone material can be represented by alkylated polysiloxane materials such as silica aerogels and xero gels and hydrophobic silicas of various types. The silicone material can be described as siloxane having the formula Particularly useful suds suppressors are the self emulsifying silicone suds suppressors, described in U.S. Patent 4,073,118, Gault et al, issued February 21, 1978, incorporated herein by reference. An example of such a compound is DB 544, commer cially available from Dow Corning, which is a siloxane glycol copolymer. Suds modifiers as described above are used at levels of up to approximately 2 , preferably from about 0.1 to about 1½ by weight of the surfactant. Microcrystalline waxes having a melting point in the range from 35 C 115 C and a saponification value of less than 100 represent additional examples of preferred suds control compon ents for use in the subject compositions, and are described in detail in U.S. Patent 4,056,481, Tate, issued November 1, 1977, incorporated herein by reference. The microcrystalline waxes are substantially water insoluble, but are water dispersible in the presence of organic surfactants. Preferred microcrystalline waxes have a melting point from about 65 C to 100 C, a molecular weight in the range from 400 1,000 and a penetration value of at least 6, measured at 77 F by ASTM D1321. Suitable examples of the above waxes include microcrystalline and oxidized microcrystal line petroleum waxes Fischer Tropsch and oxidized Fischer Tropsch waxes ozokerite ceresin montan wax beeswax cande lilla and carnauba wax. Alkyl phosphate esters represent an additional preferred suds control agent for use herein. These preferred phosphate esters are predominantly monostearyl phosphate which, in addition thereto, can contain di and tristearyl phosphates and monooleyl phosphate, which can contain di and trioleyl phosphate. Other suds control agents useful in the practice of the invention are the soap or the soap and nonionic mixtures as disclosed in U.S. Patents 2,954,347 and 2,954,348, incorporated herein by reference. The level of bleach activator or peroxyacid in these bleaching compositions should be sufficient to provide between from about 0.2 to about 10 mg L ¹ active oxygen, preferably from about 0.5 to about 4 mg L ¹ of active oxygen, and most preferably about 2 mg L ¹ of active oxygen. This invention also relates to the process of bleaching tex tiles with a compound which, when in aqueous solution, yields a peroxyacid of the following formula The following examples are given to illustrate the parameters of and compositions within the invention. All percentages, parts and ratios are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The following data show the results of a bleach test using a detergent outside the scope of the current invention. For com parison, the efficacy of each bleach treatment in removing the specified stain is expressed as a percentage of the removal achieved by a reference bleach, C₈OBS, wherein C₈ denotes the carbon chain length including carbonyl carbon and OBS denotes the oxybenzenesulfonate leaving group. The activators perhydrolyze to generate the corresponding monoperoxy acid, for example, C₈MPA. In several of the examples shown, the monoperoxy acid is delivered to the wash medium directly. The detergent formula used for these tests delivered the following concentrations of actives This test shows that the C₁₂OBS activator performs poorly in the presence of a cationic surfactant, even though the corre sponding monoperoxy acid C₁₂MPA performs well. The test also shows that C₁₄ MPA performs poorly. The extent of perhydrolysis of any bleach activator is an important indicator of its potential bleaching performance level. Perhydrolysis may be measured by dissolving the activator and hydrogen peroxide together in water at constant pH and tempera ture. Aliquots are then sampled from the reaction medium and mixed with an ice cold aqueous solution of potassium iodide and glacial acetic acid. The resulting brown color is titrated to a colorless endpoint with sodium thiosulfate solution. The volume of titrant employed is related to the amount of activator that has been converted into the desired peroxy acid. The following table shows data developed for the activator, C₁₂OBS, with a five mole excess of hydrogen peroxide. The base formula used for the experiments was as follows The bleach activator, C₁₂OBS, was used at 0.30m The results again show that no peroxy acid is produced in the presence of a cationic surfactant. The data also show that increasing ionic strength decreases the amount of peroxy acid generated. The following table compares the performance of C₁₂ OBS and C₉ OBS in a stain removal test in a detergent formula having an ionic strength of 0.010 and a pH of 10.3. A panel score unit represents the averages of grades given by three expert panelists using the scale 0 no difference 1 think there s a small difference 2 know there s a small differ ence 3 know there s a large difference. The results above show that C₁₂OBS plus a fivefold molar excess of hydrogen peroxide deliver stain removal performance equal to if not better than that of C₉OBS. In an analogous experiment in which a cationic surfactant was present, this comparison heavily favored C₉OBS, as in comparative Example I. The detergent composition used in this experiment was composed of The test was carried out in 1 L of water at 100 F in a Terg O Tometer pot with 100 rpm agitation. The conversion of C₁₂OBS to C₁₂MPA was 51 . The following table compares the performance of C₁₂ MPA in a stain removal test in detergent formulae having varying ionic strengths and a pH of 10.0. The base ingredient formula used for the experiment was as follows The test was carried out as described in Example II. The results show that the performance of C₁₂ MPA declines above an ionic strength of 0.050 except on spaghetti stain which is susceptible to bleaching by the lauroyl peroxide formed under these conditions. The following table compares the performance of C₁₄ MPA across several ionic strengths using the methodology described in Example III. The test shows that the performance of C₁₄ MPA declines above an ionic strength of about 0.0030 except on spaghetti stain. The tetradecanoyl peroxide formed becomes insoluble inaccessible to perhydroxyl anion at lower ionic strengths than the lauroyl peroxide produced in Example III. Other such comparisons were also made, and in each case the activators within the current invention gave stain removal performance comparable to the shorter chain length homologues only if the ionic strength was maintained below 0.050 and pref erably below 0.030.
