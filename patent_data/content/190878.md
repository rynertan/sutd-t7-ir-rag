## Description
The present invention relates to an extruded stretched filament of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene and to a method and apparatus for producing the same. Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene is increasingly used as a so called engineering plastic because of its excellent impact resistance, abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, tensile strength, and other properties, when compared with conventional polyethylene. However, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene has an extremely high melt viscosity and poor flowability when compared with conventional polyethylene, and thus it is very difficult to mold such a plastic by conventional extrusion molding and injection molding. Accordingly, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene is generally molded by compression molding with the exception of rods and the like, which are partly extrusion molded at a very low extrusion speed. On the other hand, as a method for stretching the monofilament of high density polyethylene at a high draw ratio, it has been proposed in, for example, Japanese Examined Patent Publication Kokoku No. 37 9765, that an additive e.g., o chlorobenzene, xylene having a boiling point higher than the melting point of the polyethylene is incorporated into the polyethylene in an amount of 20 to 150 by weight based on the weight of the polyethylene and the resultant dispersion is formed into a primary fibrous material, followed by hot stretching at a draw ratio of 3 to 15 while retaining the 5 to 25 by weight corresponding amount of the additive in the spun threads. It has been also proposed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 56 15408, that a solution of linear polyethylene having a molecular weight of 400,000 or more is spun, followed by stretching the same at a temperature such that the modulus of at least 20 GPa can be obtained. However, although these methods can provide stretched filaments having a high elasticity and high strength, raw filaments having a diameter of more than 1 mm are very difficult to obtain since a solution having an extremely low viscosity obtained by diluting ultra high molecular weight polyethylene with a large amount of a solvent is extruded and processed. Thus, the stretched thread has a diameter of at most about 0.042 mm 50 deniers and generally of 0.038 mm 10 deniers or less. Accordingly, since a large amount of these stretched fine threads must be intertwined to form thick ropes and nets having a high strength, or cords for cord cutters i.e., lawn mowers , there are problems in that the process operations are troublesome, the stiffness of the resultant ropes and nets is unpreferably high, and the flexibility is insufficient. Furthermore, the resultant ropes and nets are usually very hairy. In addition, it has been proposed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Kokai No. 52 74682, that polymers having a weight average molecular weight of 150,000 or more are processed under the conditions of a temperature of about 75 C to about 140 C and a deformation ratio of about 18 or more to form elongated and orientated polymers. However, this reference describes that the diameter of fibers or the thickness of films or tapes before stretching is preferably about 1 mm or less. Also, the Examples given therein only disclose that polyethylene having a molecular weight of about 300,000 is spun through circular orifices having a diameter of 1 mm to form thin filaments having a diameter of 0.7 mm or less and, in the case of polyethylene having a molecular weight of 800,000, filaments are prepared only by stretching dumbbell shaped samples having a gauge dimension of 1 cm x 0.2 cm derived from the compressed sheet having a thickness of 0.5 mm. Thus, it has not been established in the art that filaments having a diameter of more than 1 mm can be industrially produced from ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having an extremely high molecular weight. Furthermore, it has been desired in the art to substitute plastic wires for the iron wires usually used in, for example, orchards, e.g., for tying the loculi of fruit and for grape vine trellises, because iron wires easily rust and cannot withstand the effects of long term use. However, conventionally commercialized plastic wires composed of nylon and polypropylene have a certain elasticity and, therefore, cannot be plastically deformed, unlike iron wires For example, plastic wires cannot be firmly joined only by twisting. The present invention addresses disadvantages of the prior art and provides for production of an extruded filament of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having an outer diameter of 0.2 to 20 mm, e.g. more than 1 mm , and a stretched such filament. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an extruded stretched filament of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having an intrinsic viscosity π of at least 3.5 dl g as determined in decalin solvent at 135 C, a tensile strength at break of at least 98.0665 MPa 10 kg mm² , a draw ratio of at least 3, a C axis orientation degree of at least 0.9, and an outer diameter of 0.1 to 10 mm . In accordance with the present invention, there is also provided a method for producing an extruded In accordance with the present invention, there is further provided an apparatus for producing an extruded The present invention will be better understood from the description set forth below with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein The ultra high molecular weight polyethylenes usable in the present invention are crystalline ethylene homopolymer or crystalline ethylene alpha olefin copolymers having a major content of ethylene e.g., an ethylene content of about 95 to about 100 mol having an intrinsic viscosity η , determined at 135 C in a decalin solvent, of 3.5 dl g or more, preferably 4 dl g or more, more preferably 8 to 25 dl g, and a melt flow rate MFR , determined according to an ASTM D 1238 F method, of 0.01 g 10 min or less. Examples of the alpha olefin comonomers are those having 3 to 20 carbon atoms such as propylene, 1 butene, 1 hexene, 1 octene, and 4 methyl 1 pentene. According to the present invention, the stretched filaments of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene can be obtained by stretching raw filaments thereof prepared as mentioned below. The resultant stretched filaments have an intrinsic viscosity η of at least 3.5 dl g, preferably 4 dl g or more, more preferably 6 to 20 dl g. a tensile strength TS at break of at least 98.0665 MPa 10 kg mm² , preferably 196.133 MPa 20 kg mm² or more, more preferably 392.266 MPa 40 kg mm² When the intrinsic viscosity η is less than 3.5 dl g, the average chain length of the molecules is short and, therefore, the tensile strength is disadvantageously small even in the case of the higher draw ratio. When the TS at break is less than 98.0665 MPa 10 kg mm² , When the outer diameter of the stretched filaments according to the present invention is less than 0.1 mm , the productivity of the raw filament is low and is not practical, although the filament can be technically produced. Contrary to this, when the outer diameter is more than 10 mm , the initial investment for the stretching device becomes unpreferably large and practical usage of the filament is poor. According to the present invention, the raw filaments of the stretched filaments of the ultra high molecular weight can be produced by melting the above mentioned ultra high molecular weight polyethylene in a screw extruder, preferably a screw extruder provided with a grooved cylinder or barrel , and then melt extruding the molten polyethylene from a die having an L D of at least 10, preferably 15 or more, more preferably, 30 to 60. After the extruding, the extrudate is taken off at a draft ratio of at least 1, preferably 1.2 to 30, while the extruded strands are gradually cooled, preferably by passing through a cooling cylinder having a length of, for example, 0.3 to 5 m, and air blowing at 15 C to 80 C. Thus, the desired raw filaments of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having an outer diameter of generally 0.2 to 20 mm , preferably 2 to 10 mm , and having an excellent stretchability can be obtained. The term. draft ratio used herein denotes the ratio of the take off speed of the taking off unit to the extruding speed of the extruded polyethylene at the outlet of the die. When a die having an L D of less than 10 is used, the molten polyethylene has a poor melt flowability and is not completely uniformly fused before being extruded from the die, since the molten ultra high molecular weight polyethylene is a rubber like mass unlike the molten product of conventional polyethylene and, therefore, only raw filaments having a poor stretchability can be obtained. As a result, the stretched filaments having sufficient strength cannot be obtained even after stretching. On the other hand, although there is no critical limitation to the upper limit of the L D ratio, the preferable upper limit of the L D ratio is 100 from a practical viewpoint. The shape of the die is generally circular or cylindrical. There is a correlationship between the productivity and the L D ratio of the die. Thus, the larger the L D ratio, the bigger the increase in the production rate i.e., the taking off speed . When the molten strands extruded from the die are quenched, for example, by means of a water circulation water bath, raw filaments having poor stretchability are obtained because bubbles having a vacuum are generated. in the cores of the strands and because the crystallinity becomes low. In addition, in order to obtain stretched filaments having an excellent tensile strength at break from the raw filaments obtained by the draft ratio of less than 1, the draw ratio must be at least 4 and thus loses efficiency. According to the present invention, there are no critical limitations to the extrusion molding temperature of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, as long as the temperature is higher than the melting point of the polyethylene but lower than the decomposition temperature thereof. The preferable extrusion temperature conditions of the above mentioned ultra high molecular weight polyethylene are an extruder temperature of 180 C to 350 C, a temperature between the inlet and the intermediate portion of the tube die of 180 C to 300 C, and temperatures between the intermediate portion and the outlet of the tube die of 135 C to 160 C. Thus, according to the present invention, the desired raw filaments of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having an outer diameter of 0.2 to 20 mm , preferably 2 to 10 mm , especially when the wires are produced therefrom, can be obtained. When the extruded raw filaments of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having an outer diameter of 0.2 to 20 mm are produced, either dry stretching or wet stretching may be carried out. However, the use of wet stretching is preferable from the standpoint of heat transfer efficiency and temperature control accuracy. Furthermore, the use of multiple step stretching is preferable, when compared to single step stretching, because the draw ratio can be increased and because stretched filaments having a high strength can be obtained. A typical embodiment of the apparatus suitable for use in the production of extruded raw filaments from the above mentioned ultra high molecular weight polyethylene will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawing. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the apparatus for producing raw filaments from the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene comprises, in sequence from the extruder side, an extruder 1 provided with a grooved cylinder 2 and a screw 3 having a compression ratio of 1 to 2.5, preferably 1.3 to 1,8 a cylindrical die 6 connected to the tip of the screw 3, a cooling cylinder 9, and a taking off unit 10. The die 6 has an L D ratio of at least 10, preferably 15 or more, more preferably 30 to 60, and a ratio S₁ S₂ of a cross sectional area S₁ of the inlet portion 4 of the die 6 to a cross sectional area S₂ of the outlet portion 5 of the die 6 of 1 to 5, preferably 1.5 to 3.0. The cooling cylinder 9 for gradually cooling the extruded strands is provided with an air ring or sizing die not shown at the inlet portion 8 of the strands. The grooved cylinder 2 is provided with groove portions 11 to ensure a stable feed of the powder particles of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene to a compression zone 12. As mentioned above, the compression ratio of the screw 3 should be within the range of 1 to 2.5. When the compression ratio of the screw 3 is less than 1.0, the contact stress of the polyethylene against the cylinder wall is small, so that the extrusion amount becomes unstable and the resultant extruded filaments will have a poor appearance due to surging or insufficient deaeration. Contrary to this, when the compression ratio of the screw 3 is more than 2.5, the polyethylene temperature is abnormally increased due to clogging and the generation of frictional heat in the compression zone, so that the friction coefficient and abrasion resistance of the extruded raw filaments are impaired due to a decrease in the molecular weight of the polyethylene caused by thermal decomposition. The term compression ratio of the screw 3 used herein is defined by a ratio of the groove depth at the hopper portion of the screw 3 to the groove depth at the screw tip. The L D ratio of the extruder 1 according to the present invention is generally 7 to 32, preferably 20 to 26. When the L D ratio of the extruder 1 is less than 7, powder of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene is likely to be fed to the cylindrical die 4 because of incomplete melting. On the other hand, when the L D ratio of the cylindrical die 6 is less than 10, raw filaments having a poor stretchability are formed because the molten product of the ultra high molecular weight is not completely fused before the molten product is extruded from the die. The L D ratio of the cylindrical die 6 is defined by a ratio of the length L between the inlet portion 4 of the cylindrical die 6 and the outlet portion 5 of the die 6 to the inner diameter D of the die outlet 5. Also, as mentioned above, the ratio S₁ S₂ should be within the range of 1 to 5. When the ratio S₁ S₂ is less than 1, the fusion of the molten ultra high molecular weight polyethylene becomes incomplete due to an insufficient inner pressure and, therefore, the appearance or shape of the extruded strand is worsened and the desired raw filaments having an excellent stretchability cannot be obtained. Contrary to this, when the ratio S₁ S₂ is more than 5, a so called shear failure stream is possibly generated in the molten product and, therefore, an unpreferable low speed extrusion must be carried out. There are no critical limitations to the length of the gradual cooling cylinder 9 as long as the length thereof is sufficient to cool the molten strands extruded from the cylindrical die without quenching. For example, the length of the cooling cylinder 9 is generally 0.3 to 5 m, preferably 1 to 3 m. When the length of the cooling cylinder 9 is less than 0.3 m, the molten strands cannot be properly gradually cooled when the taking off speed is high. The air ring provided at the inlet portion of the cooling cylinder 9 for molten strands is designed to gradually cool the molten strands by supplying warm air having a temperature off from 15 C to 80 C, preferably, 30 C to 50 C. Furthermore, in the apparatus according to the present invention, a sizing die not shown is optionally provided at the inlet side of the cooling cylinder 9 to control the size of the molten strands and to gradually cool those strands. According to the present invention, the extruded strands having an intrinsic viscosity η of, for example, 4 dl g, preferably 8 to 30 dl g, and a TS at break of 196.133 MPa 20 kg mm² or more, preferably 490.3325 MPa 50 kg mm² or more, are stretched at a draw ratio of 8 to 30 to form whitened plastic wires. The resultant plastic wires of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene are oriented and crystallized in the stretching direction by stretching. As a result, the wires are divided into fine fibers to form whitened wires, and accordingly, when the wires are bent or twisted, deformation is caused by slip between the fibers based on stress. Thus, even after the stress is removed, such deformation can not be recovered and the wires brought to their original linear shape, due to the elasticity thereof. The folding return angles ϑ when the present wire is folded at 90 and 180 are 20 or less, preferably 10 or less. The term folding return angle used herein means the returning angle ϑ after the wires are allowed to stand for 10 minutes at the folding conditions as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. When the intrinsic viscosity η is less than 4 dl g, the average molecular chain lengths are small and, therefore, the tensile strength cannot be increased even when the draw ratio is increased. On the other hand, when the TS at break is less than 196.133 MPa 20 kg mm² , the strength is likely to be insufficient for enabling the plastic wires to be used instead of iron wires. The outer diameter of the plastic wires according to the present invention is generally about 0.4 to 3.5 mm , preferably about 0.5 to 2.5 mm . The plastic wires according to the present invention can be used either as a single wire or as thicker wires obtained by twisting a plurality of single wires. When the outer diameter is less than 0.4 mm , the productivity of the raw filaments is low from the industrial point of view. On the other hand, when the thickness of the wire is more than 3.5 mm , the initial cost for the stretching apparatus is unpreferably large and also no practical use thereof can be expected. The stretching temperature is preferably a temperature of the melting point of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene plus 15 C or less, preferably 80 C to 150 C, more preferably 100 C to 150 C. Although the stretching can be effected even at a temperature higher than the melting point of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene plus 15 C, the desired whitened wires having a high strength cannot always be obtained. Contrary to this, when the stretching temperature is too low, the desired high strength cannot always be obtained although the whitened wires can be obtained. Although the stretching can be carried out at a single stage, a multi stage stretching can be advantageously utilized because the draw ratio can be increased and because the desired stretched filaments having a high strength can be obtained. The typical multi stage stretching conditions are as follows. That is, the raw filaments or strands are stretched at a draw ratio of 4 to 8 at 80 C to 135 C in the first stage, and the stretched filaments are then stretched at a draw ratio of 2 to 5 at 140 C to 150 C in the second stage. Thus, the raw filaments are stretched at a total draw ratio of 8 to 30, preferably 10 to 30. The plastic wires thus obtained are oriented and crystallized in the stretching direction and are whitened. As explained above, although the stretched filaments of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene according to the present invention have an outer diameter of 0.1 to 10 mm , which is very much thicker than that of conventional melt spun filaments or the like of ultra high molecular weight, the stretched filaments according to the present invention have an extremely high tensile strength at break, when compared to conventional stretched filaments of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, while retaining the inherent characteristics of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene such as abrasion resistance, self lubricating properties, and impact resistance. Accordingly, the present stretched filaments can be advantageously used as, for example, thick ropes and nets for ship mooring and load carriers or cords for cord cutters i.e., lawn mowers , for which the use of conventional ultra high molecular weight polyethylene filaments is limited. Furthermore, the above mentioned production process and apparatus according to the present invention, can stably produce raw filaments of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having an excellent stretchability, which filaments are suitable for producing stretched filaments having the above mentioned characteristics and which have been difficult to produce heretofore. Furthermore, as mentioned above, since the plastic wires produced according to the present invention are plastically deformable, these plastic wires can be twisted for tying in the same way as iron wires. Accordingly, the plastic wires according to the present invention can be substituted for conventional iron wires in any usage where no substantial heat is applied. For example, the plastic wires according to the present invention can be used for tying the loculi of fruit and for constructing grape vine trellises and orchard shelves. In addition, since the plastic wires according to the present invention do not rust, unlike iron wires, the present plastic wires have an excellent serviceability and can be repeatedly used, without snapping the wires, due to the plastic deformability thereof. The present invention will now be further illustrated by the following Examples. Stretchable raw filaments or strands of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene were produced by using an apparatus for producing such stretchable raw filaments or strands . The specifications of the apparatus used are as follows. Powdered ultra high molecular weight polyethylene Hizex Million 240M available from Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Ltd. having an intrinsic viscosity η of 16.5 dl g, an MFR of less than 0.01 g 10 min, a melting point of 136 C, and a bulk density of 0.45 g cm³ was extruded from the above specified extruder under the following conditions to produce stretchable raw filaments or strands of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having an outer diameter of 4.0 mm . The resultant strands were stretched in a stretching bath containing triethylene glycol at a draw ratio of 18 i.e., first stage 6 times at 133 C, second stage 3 times at 144 C to produced the stretched filaments. In Comparative Example 1, conventional polyethylene having an intrinsic viscosity η of 2.6 dl g, an MFR of 0.11 g 10 min, a density of 0.956 g cm³, and a melting point of 131 C was extruded and stretched in the same manner as in Example 1, except that the extruder temperature was changed to 220 C. Thus, the stretched filaments were produced. The physical properties of the resultant stretched filaments were determined according to the following methods. The results were as shown in Table 1. Degree of orientation Degree of orientation was calculated from the following equation by determining the 110 face reflection by using X ray diffraction apparatuses RU 200A and RU 200PL. wherein α is the half width of 110 face reflection Stretchable strands of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having an outer diameter of 8.0 mm were produced in the same manner as in Example 1, except that a die having a length of 600 mm, an inner diameter at die outlet of 12 mm , an L D ratio of 50, and an S₁ S₂ ratio of 1.9 was used, and that the screw revolution number and the taking off speed were changed to 50 rpm and 0.8 m min, respectively. The strands thus obtained were stretched at a draw ratio of 8 i.e., first stage 4 times at 134 C, second stage 2 times at 145 C . In Comparative Example 2, stretched filaments were produced in the same manner as in Example 2, except that the conventional polyethylene used in Example 1 was used in lieu of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. The physical properties of the resultant stretched filaments were determined in the same manner as in Example 1. The results are as shown in Table 1. An attempt was made to produce stretchable strands of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene used in Example 1 in the same manner as in Example 1, except that a die having a length of 50 mm, an inner diameter, at die outlet, of 6 mm , an L D ratio of 8.3, and an S₁ S₂ ratio of 1.1 was used, the setting temperatures of the extruder, D₁ , and D₂ were changed to 350 C, 230 C, and 140 C, respectively and the screw revolution number and the taking off speed were changed to 25 rpm and 0.7 m min, respectively. However, the polyethylene was intermittently cut off and continuous stretchable strands could not be produced. The stretchable strands produced in Example 1 were stretched in a stretching bath containing triethylene glycol under the following draw ratios The resultant stretched filaments were evaluated as follows The results are as shown in Table 2. As is clear from the results shown in Table 2, when the stretching ratio or draw ratio is 8 or more, more specifically, 10 or more, the desired plastic wires having a small return angle when folded and having an excellent tensile strength at break can be obtained. Contrary to this, when conventional polyethylene is used, the desired plastic wires having a small return angle when folded cannot be obtained.
