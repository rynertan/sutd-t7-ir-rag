# Sheet feeding apparatus.

## Abstract
This relates to sheet feeding apparatus of the kind in which sheets following separate first and second belt transport paths are fed into a common belt transport path. At the junction of portions of the paths of belts 5 and 9 which define portions of the first and second belt transport paths, a sheet guide 8 is freely mounted for pivotal movement about the shaft of a roller 20, the guide 8 having surfaces tapering to a leading end which extends towards the meeting point of the belts 5 and 9. One of these surfaces assists in guiding notes from the first path into the third common belt transport path, defined by the belts 5 and 9 upstream of their meeting point and the other of the guide surfaces guides notes arriving from the second belt transport path into the common path. Because the guide is freely mounted, it can be deflected by the sheets themselves and as they do not arrive at the junction simultaneously, adequate clearance is neces sary on only one side of the guide at any one time and its leading end can extend further into the junction.
