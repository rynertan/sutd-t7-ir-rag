# Method of and apparatus for use in reinforcing a piling structure, and a precast concrete pile for use in the method.

## Abstract
A method of reinforcing a piling structure by means of an improved precast concrete pile and hydraulic sealing apparatus which comprises the steps of driving a hollow, precast concrete pile 1 into the ground by means of a pile driver, the pile being formed with thin and frangible portions formed in its peripheral wall, holding in suspension a hydraulic cylinder 8 fitted with a resilient rubber packing 10 thereunder at a desired level within the hollow body of the pile, filling the hydraulic cylinder with oil to cause radial swelling of the rubber packing to such an extent that the deformed rubber closes the clearance between itself and the inner periphery of the pile body and thus defines therewith a sealed hollow space 5b under the rubber packing, and pumping pressurized mortar through a hose 15 into the sealed hollow space of the pile until the thin and frangible portions of the pile burst open from increasing internal pressure thus enabling the internal mortar to rush out and penetrate the surrounding soil, with the subsequently har dened masses of mortar serving as claws 14 protruding outwardly from within the pile body to prevent settlement of the embedded pile. A plurality of such claws can be formed along the length of the pile by separate injection of mortar into the divided, sealed hollow sections of the pile body from the lower to the higher section. A hollow, precast concrete pile particularly suitable for use in the method has a tapered order, preferably along the length of the pile. end and a plurality of spaced apart concavities 6 disposed in its inner or outer peripheral wall in an upwardly spiralling
