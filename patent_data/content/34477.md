# A power source circuit for an electric discharge machine.

## Abstract
There is provided a power source circuit for use with an electric discharge machine which machines a work W by a discharge produced between an electrode P and the work W . When an arc forms in a working gap defined between the electrode P and the work W , the OFF period of a switching element Q inserted in a charging path of a capacitor C for storing a discharge energy is increased so that a current flow ing across the working gap is cut off for a longer period of time than in the case of a normal operation, thereby quickly recov ering insulation during arcing.
