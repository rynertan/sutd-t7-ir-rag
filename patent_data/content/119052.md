# Short circuit MIG welding.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for short circuit MIG welding is described. The apparatus comprises a power supply 1 electrically connected with electrode wire 2 and a work piece 4 in use and electrode wire feed means 8 . Monitoring means 9 is provided for monitoring the ratio M of one of the mean and successive integral of the arc duration to the corresponding one of the mean and the successive integral of the short circuit duration. The welding process can be monitored by monitoring the ratio M .
