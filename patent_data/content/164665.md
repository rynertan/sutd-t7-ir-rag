# X ray tube apparatus.

## Abstract
An X ray tube apparatus is disclosed, which comprises a vacuum envelope and, an anode target 8 and a cathode assembly 6 both disposed in the envelope and facing each other. The cathode assembly 6 includes a filament 20 for emitting an electron beam, filament supports 30 for sup porting the filament 20 and a beam shaping electrode 40 for passing through the electron beam from the filament 20 and focusing the electron beam. The fllament 20 has a flat sheet like electron emission portion 22 , a pair of U shaped portions 24 provided at the opposite ends of the electron emission portion 22 , in such manner that they extend from the opposite ends in the direction away from the anode target 8 and bend back toward the anode target 8 , and a pair of supported end portions each extending from the U shaped portions 24 .
