# Method and apparatus for testing a battery.

## Abstract
The operating condition and or characteristics of a battery is tested by obtaining the dynamic voltage current characteristic of the battery as a function of the charge condition thereof. A controllably varying charging current is supplied to the battery, and the voltage produced across the battery while that current is supplied is measured. The dynamic voltage current characteristic is obtained as a function of the measured voltage and supplied current. This voltage current characteristic is compared to predetermined voltage current characteristics representing batteries of the type being tested in order to determine the operating condition and or characteristics of the battery under test.
