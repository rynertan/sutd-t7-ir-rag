# Scale inhibiting compositions and process for inhibiting scale in systems exposed to water.

## Abstract
Compositions which inhibit the formation of scale due to calcium carbonate precipitation in recirculating water sys tems comprise a mixture of polyvinylpyrrolidone and ami notri methylenephosphonic acid . The compositions are pre ferably present in the water system in an amount from 2 to 25 ppm and preferably contain from 1 to 10 moles of the phosphonic acid per mole of polyvinylpyrrolidone.
