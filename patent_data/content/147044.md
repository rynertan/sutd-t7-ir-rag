## Description
OFURANCARBOXAMIDES, PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND PHARMACEUTICAL PEPARAT ONS CO TA NJ NG THEM The present invention relates to a novel group of benzamides which are useful as antiemtic and or antipsychotic agents. More particularly, it relates to a novel group of benzofuran 7 carboxamides. There has been little treatment in the literature of the relationship between structure and activity of antiemetic and antipsychotic agents. A large number of chemically quite diverse compounds have been used particularly as antiemetic agents. This is due to the fact that there is more than one physiological cause for these disorders. U.S. Patent No. 3,342,826 discloses a number of benzamide derivatives which are useful antipsychotic and antiemetic agents. Among the compounds disclosed in the patent is sulpiride, 2 methoxy N l ethyl 2pyrrolidinylmethyl 5 sulfamoyl benzamide. U.S. Patent 3,177,252 to Thominet discloses metoclopramide, 4 amino 5chloro N 2 diethylamino ethyl 2 methoxybenzamide, which has been used clinincally to prevent emesis. Benzamide derivatives function as antiemetic and antipsychotic agents by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. The administration of sulpiride, metoclopramide, and other prior benzamide derivatives is accompanied by several undesirable side effects including an increase in the release of prolactin and extrapyramidal side effects.It is believed that in blocking certain dopamine receptors benzamide derivatives prevent the secretion of prolactin inhibiting factor or PIF, which regulates the release of prolactin. As a result, there is an elevation in prolactin levels and mammary hypertrophy in the form of breast engorgement, galactorrhea, and amenorrhea results. Thus, there is a need for effective antiemetic and antipsychotic agents and, particularly, for antiemetic and antipsychotic agents which are free from the aforementioned side effects. The principal object of the present invention is to provide benzofurancarboxamides which are useful as antiemetic and, or antipsychotic agents and pharmaceutical preparations containing the same. In the case of benzamide derivatives, it appears that the 2 methoxy group located adjacent to the carboxamide linkage in both sulpiride and metoclopramide plays an important role in providing good antipsychotic and antiemetic activity. The compounds of the present invention are characterized in that the oxygen atom in the benzofuran ring is adjacent thse carboxamide linkage. The compounds of the present invention are represented by the general formula I EMI2.1 wherein Z represents the atoms necessary to complete a benzotb furan or a dihydrobenzo b furan ring R1, R2 and R3 may be the same or different and represent a member selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an amino group, an alkyl substituted amino group, an acylamido group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a sulfonamido group having up to 6 carbon atoms, a halogen atom, and a nitro group A represents a tertiary aminoalkyl group containing the atomic sequence EMI3.1 Typical examples of the tertiary alkylamino groups represented by A in formula I are EMI3.2 wherein R6, R7 and R8 are selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom and a lower alkyl group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The present invention is more specifically directed to benzolb furan and dihydrobenzoib furan carboxamides represented by the formula II and III whereinR1, R2 and R3 are defined as above and R9 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms and to pharmaceutical preparations containing the same.EMI4.1 The present invention is still more specifically directed to compounds of the formula I, II or III whereinR2 is a lower alkyl group and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the same. With reference to formulae I, II, and III above, in more detail Z represents the atoms necessary to complete a benzolb furan or a dihydrobenzo b furan ring which may be substituted in the 2 or 3 position by a lower alkyl group such as a methyl group or an ethyl group or may be unsubstituted. Thus, where Z represents the atoms necessary to form a dihydrobenzolb furan ring, Z may be a CnH2n group where n is 2 to 4 such as CH2CH2 , CH2CH CH3 , CH2C CH3 2 , CH Ch3 CH2 , CH2CH C2Hs etc. Where Z represents the atoms necessary to form a benzofuran ring, Z may represent CH CH , CH CCH3, or CH3C CH . Representative examples of the alkyl group represented by R1, R2 or R3 include lower alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, and t butyl groups. Representative examples of the halogen atoms represented by R1 R2 and R3 include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine atoms. The amino group represented by R1, R2 or R3 may be an unsubstituted amino group or a substituted amino group of the formula NR4R5 wherein R4 and R5 may be the same or different and selected from a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, etc. Otherwise, the amino group can be a substituted amino group such as an acylamido or a sulfonamido group of the formula NHCOR4 and NHSO2R4 wherein R4 is defined as above. Representative examples of the alkoxy groups forR1, R2 and R3 include alkoxy groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methoxy, ethoxy, and propoxy. Of the compounds represented by the formula I, II and III, those which appear to be particularly preferred are compounds in which R2 is an alkyl group and A is a 2 N ethyl pyrrolidinylmethyl group. The compounds of the present invention exhibit antipsychotic and antiemetic activitiy in in vivo screening tests as shown below. The compounds can be compounded with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier for parenteral or oral administration. In most cases the compounds are useful in the form of the acid addition salt, e.g., the hydrochloride, phosphate, fumarate, citrate, tartarate. Therapeutically effective dosages will lie in the range of about 0.01 to 10 mg kg. The compounds of the present invention are conveniently prepared by condensing benzo b furan 7carboxylic or dihydrobenzo b furan 7 carboxylic acid chlorides or esters with appropriate amines and recovering the carboxamides as acid salts. Hereinbelow, four synthetic approaches to the carboxamides are described. The synthesis of the benzofuran 7 carboxylic acid esters, which are convertible to the acid chloride to produce benzofurancarboxamides in accordance with the present invention proceeds along Reaction Scheme I REACTION SCHEME IEMI7.1 The compounds of the present invention can be prepared from commercially available substituted or unsubstituted salicylic acids. In accordance withReaction Scheme I, 2 ,3 ,4 ,5 or 6 substituted or unsubstituted benzofuran 7 carboxamides can be synthesized from salicylic acid 1 by treating the acid with methanol in the presence of sulfuric acid, as a catalyst, to produce the methyl ester 2 . The ester 2 can be alkylated to give the intermediate 3 in over 90 yield by nucleophilic substitution of the phenoxide ion with an allyl halide in acetone containing potassium carbonate.The 2 unsubstituted derivatives are prepared by substitution with allyl bromide. The 2 or 3 alkyl substituted derivatives are prepared by reacting with 3 chloro 2 alkyl propene or 3 chloro 3 alkyl propene. The products are clean and can be used for subsequent reaction without purification. By heating the intermediate 3 at about 2000C under argon either without any solvent Method A or withN,N dimethylaniline Method B , a Claisen rearrangement takes place resulting in the compound 4. Table I below summarizes the Claisen rearrangement conditions for obtaining eight intermediates Compounds 4a 4h by this method and provides the relevant analytical data.Attempts to distill compounds 4f and 4g led to mixtures possibly due to production of para isomers by further rearrangement. Chromatography of the reaction mixture 49 gave the desired compound 4g along with the p isomer in 3.7 yield. Column chromatography of compound 4f led to isolation of four products including compound 4f.

Acid catalysts are employed for cyclization of the aldehydes or ketones to produce compound 6 . The acid catalysts of choice are either Amberlyst XN1010 and trifluoroacetic acid TFA . TFA is more preferred because it requires a shorter reaction time and generates fewer by products. Using either catalyst, the phenolic hydroxy group attacks the aldehyde to form a hemiacetal which loses water and results in the benzofuran ester 6 .

Reaction Schemes II IV below are alternative syntheses for dihydrobenzoiblfuran 7 carboxamides. Reaction Scheme II which is particularly useful in synthesizing the 2 alkyl 2,3 dihydrobenzo b furan derivatives proceeds from the Claisen rearrangement product 4 of Reaction Scheme I as follows REACTION SCHEME IIEMI14.1 The intermediate 10 is obtained by reacting the product 4 with mercuric acetate in dry THF in the dark. Reduction of intermediate 10 with sodium borohydride in 3N NaOH gives, upon workup by column chromatography, the dihydrobenzotblfuran 7 carboxylic ester 11 . The ester can be converted to the corresponding acid chloride and reacted with an appropriate amine to give dihydrobenzo b furans such as compound 13 as previously outlined.

Nitrogen containing compounds were analyzed for C, H, N others for C, H only. Substituents can be introduced into the benzene ring by selecting the appropriate substituted salicyclic acid as a starting material or by reacting the benzofuran carboxylic acid with the appropriate electrophilic reagent. For example, chlorination of the 4 chloro derivative 12f with sulfuryl chloride at room temperature furnishes the 4,5 dichloro derivative 12i Table V in 54 yield. Nitration of compound 12f in refluxing HN03 TFA gives the 4 chloro 5 nitro derivative 12j in moderate yield. In general it is desired to perform the electrophilic substitutions before condensing the amine to avoid hydrolysis of the amine during the substitution. Other modifications can be performed after condensation and are discussed below. Table V below provides the reaction conditions for hydrolysis substitution of the esters 11 with the yield and melting point for seven dihydrobenzofuran 7carboxylic acid derivatives produced by following ReactionScheme II. The carboxamides 13 are prepared by reaction of the acid chlorides or the esters 11 by heating with the appropriate amine, which in the case of compound 13 is 2 aminomethyl l ethylpyrrolidine. In most cases, the carboxamides are most conveniently isolated as their fumarate salts. Reaction Scheme II is illustrated in more detail in Synthesis Example 2 for the synthesis of 4 chloro N lethyl 2 pyrrolidinylmethyl 2 methyl 2,3 dihydrobenzolblfuran 7 carboxamide fumarate compound 13f .

REACTION SCHEME IVEMI23.1 Reaction Scheme IV proceeds via alkylation of a 2,6 dibromophenol 18 by reaction with 1,2 dibromoethane to provide the phenyloxyethyl bromide 19 . By lithiating the bromide 19 using n butyl lithium, quenching in dry ice and acidifying 2,3 dihydrobenzo b furan 7 carboxylic acid 20 is obtained.

Antipsychotic Screen The effect of each of the benzofurancarboxamides shown in Table VIII below on apomorphine induced climbing behavior was tested under the conditions described byCostetin et al, Rapid and Dissociated Changes inSensitivities of Different Dopamine Receptors in MouseBrain , Nature, 257, 405 1975 . Each mouse was administered from 0.1 to 50 mg kg of test compound and antagonism was observed 20 minutes after injection of 1 mg,kg apomorphine induced climbing behavior. The ED 50 values are shown in Table VIII.b. Antiemetic Screen Each of the test compounds shown in Table VIII was administered subcutaneously to two beagle dogs at dosage levels of 0.05, 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mgtkg. One hour following administration of the test compound, each animal received 0.1 mgkg, sc, of apomorphine HC1. Apomorphine consistently evokes an immediate emetic response through direct dopaminergic interaction at the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone CTZ . Antiemetic compounds which act at the OTZ and, or the midbrain vomiting center will block this effect. If both animals receiving a particular treatment are protected, i.e., no emetic response within one hour after apomorphine , the test compound is considered active.The dosage at which both animals were protected 100 effect is shown in TableVIII.
