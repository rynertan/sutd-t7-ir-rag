In this case, it is desirable to convert, prior to the reaction with the pyrimidine derivative III , the alcohol and the phenol into an alcoholate and a phenolate respectively by the reaction with a base.The reaction is carried out in a solvent. As the solvent, there may be mentioned an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g., benzene, toluene, xylene and the like and an amide, e.g., dimethylformamide.

McOmie, Plenum Press,London L New York 1973 . Moreover, the 5,6 alkylenepyrimidine derivative of the present invention may also be prepared according to the following reaction scheme D .EMI25.1 wherein Y and n have the same meanings as defined above, Z means the other groups than a hydrogen atom in the groups defined as Z.The compound I of the present invention may be prepared by the condensation or addition reaction of a pyrimidine derivative V with an activated derivative of a compound Z H, such as, a lower alkyl halide, a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl halide, an acryloyl halide, a lower alkylcarbonyl halide, a substituted or unsubstituted phenylcarbonyl halide, a substituted or unsubstituted cinnamoyl halide, a substituted or unsubstituted acryloyl halide, a lower alkyl isocyanate, a lower alkyl isothiocyanate, a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl isocyanate, a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl isothiocyanate, a lower alkoxycarbonyl halide, a lower alkylsulfonyl halide, a substituted or unsubstituted phenylsulfonyl halide, a pyridyl halide, a quinolyl halide, a pyrimidyl halide, a quinazolyl halide wherein the halide means chloride, bromide and so on .This reaction may preferably be carried out with the equimolar amounts of the starting materials, and preferably in an inert solvent.
