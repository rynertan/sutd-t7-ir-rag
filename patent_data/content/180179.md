# Arrangement for detecting bursts in a TDMA communications system.

## Abstract
In order to detect bursts transmitted in a manner that each burst is located within an allocated time slot within each consecutive frame, the bursts are labelled in accordance with a burst time plan signal to produce a burst discriminating sig nal. Thereafter, information of window position and burst con dition and window mode is stored, with respect to each burst, in respective memories using the burst discriminating signal. The stored data are renewed and read out from the memories also using the burst discriminating signal. Further, the burst discriminating signal is further used to change the window mode each predetermined frames.
