# Wheelchair and method of manufacturing it.

## Abstract
A wheelchair has lateral frames each constituted by a prefabricated modular front frame unit and a prefabricated modular rear frame unit 12 secured together against relative longitudinal movement. The front frame unit has a post 40 from which upper and lower rail sections 41, 42 extend in engagement with rail sections 46, 47 se cured to a rear post 45 which acts as a wheel mounting tube. The rail sections 41, 42, 46, 47 are interlinked by a spacer tube 49 which carries a pivot sleeve 51 of a crossbrace member 52 . The upper rail section 41 carries a mounting socket 43 for a prefabricated backrest tube 35 . The frame components may be prefinished for local assembly and permit a wide range of wheelchairs of different length, width and backrest configurations to be manufactured from a restricted range of standard parts.
