# Pump systems.

## Abstract
A pump system, particularly suitable for pumping wet mix es and slurries, achieves an output of pumped material sub stantially free from pulsations or fluctuations by control move ment of power pistons 12A, 12B within power cylinders 10A, 10B . The power pistons 12A, 12B are connected by piston rods 14A, 14B to pumping pistons 16A, 16B which suck material to be pumped in through valves 20A, 20B and out through valves 22A, 22B into a delivery pipe 26 . A closed loop 32 connects annular chambers 13A, 13B of the power cylinders 10A, 10B , and a continuously operating pump P2 feeds the closed loop 32 . The power pistons 12A, 12B on their suction strokes move faster than on the delivery strokes, whereby one or other or both pistons 12A, 12B are always moving forwards. Control adequate to achieve a smooth delivery of pumped material is achieved by providing sensing valves PVA1, PVA2, PVB1, PVB2 on each power cylinder 10A, 10B , these valves being arranged to be ac tuated at different positions of the power piston 12A, 12B within the cylinder. The sensing valves pass signals to check valves CV1, CV2 to vent and close the closed loop 32 in response to actuation of the sensing valves and thus to control movement of the power pistons in the cylinders.
