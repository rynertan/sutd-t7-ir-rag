# HYBRID PLASMID AND PREPARATION THEREOF

## Abstract
A hybrid plasmid comprising of a plurality of unit plas mids joined together is disclosed, which hybrid plasmid is proliferable in a Gram positive bacterium and is stabilized against dissociation thereof into the parent unit plasmids by the removal of the base sequence related to the dissocia tion.
