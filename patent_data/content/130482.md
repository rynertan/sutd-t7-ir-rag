## Description
Diaminocyclohexane platinum complexes, process for preparing same and pharmaceutical compositions containing same The present invention relates to certain novel 1,2 diaminocyclohexane platinum complexes, pharmaceutical compositions for use in the treatment of tumors and a process for preparing the complexes. Recently, certain platinum complexes have been shown by Rosenberg et al and others to be highly active anti tumor agents see U.S. Patents 4,177,263 and 4,140,707 . For example, the complex cis dichlorodiammineplatinum II or cisplatin is the chemotherapeutic agent of choice in the treatment of many and varied tumors. There are several drawbacks, however, associated with the use of the platinum complexes to treat tumors.Generally, the platinum complexes have a relatively low solubility in water thereby rendering it difficult to formulate a composition which can effectively deliver the reagent to the site of the tumor in the body. Moreover, many of the platinum complexes are highly nephrotoxic thereby further restricting their use in the absence of precautionary measures to avoid damage to the kidneys when administered to animals afflicted with tumors. Recently, considerable activity has centered on the use of 1,2 diaminocyclohexane complexes of platinum as anti tumor agents. Sce, for example, U.S. PatentsNos. 3,892,790 3,904,663 4,115,418 4,140,707 4,169,846 4,175,133 4,228,090 and 4,256,652 and GermanOffenlegungschrift 30 22 917.Although the complexes described therein posscss antitumor activity, virtually all are difficultly soluble in water and are also relatively highl nephrotoxic. German Offenlegungschrift 30 22 957 describes 1,2 diaminocyclohexane ascorbate complexes of platinum, useful as anti tumor agents, which comprise mixtures of complexes having varying ratios of ascorbate ion to platinum. Thus, the publication discloses complexes of the formula EMI2.1 wherein n varies from 1.2 to 1.5. The complexes are described as poorly water soluble. The hereinbelow described method enables the production of complexes of DACH platinum complexes of the following formulae which contain stoichiometric ratios of anion to platinum EMI2.2 wherein X is a monovalent anion selected from the group consisting of ascorbate, isoascorbate, mono saccharate, saccharate 4 lactone, shikimate, isethionate, 2 aminoethylsulfate, azetidine carboxylate, proline, hydroxyproline, pipecolinate, cyclopropanecarboxylate, cyclobutanecarboxylate, cyclopentanecar boxylate, cyclopentenecarboxylate, cyclo hexanecarboxylate, cyclohexenecarboxylate, bicine, glycine, 2 aminoethanesulfonate, 2 chloroethanesulfonate, and Y is a divalent anion selected from the group consisting of iminodiacetate, iso citratelactone, furanedicarboxylate, cyclo propane l, l dicarboxylate and isocitra tomonoethyl esther, N methyliminodiacetate, N 2 hydroxyethyl iminodiacetate, N benzyliminodiacetate, N phenyliminodiacetate, N 2 acetamido iminodiacetate, cyclohexane 1, 1 diacetate, trans i, 2 cyciopropanedicar boxylate, trans 1,2 cyclobutanedicarboxylate, trans 1,2 cyclopentanedicarboxylate and trans 1,2 cyclohexanedicarboxylate The method of the invention for preparing the above described complexes comprises a reacting a water soluble haloplatinatc IlJ in an aqueous medium with DACH to produce a di halo DACH platinum II b reacting said product of step a with a soluble sulfate salt in an aqueous medium to produce sulfato DjtCII platinum II c reacting the product of step b with a soluble salt of X or Y to produce said complex of the above formula, and d recovering said complex. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form suitable for administration to an animal afflicted with tumor cells sensitive to a platinum complex of the above formula comprising a therapeutically anti tumor effective amount of the platinum complex and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. The invention also provides a method for the treatment of an animal afflicted with tumor cells sensitive to a platinum complex of the above formula comprising administering to the animal a therapeutically, anti tumor effective amount of the platinum complex.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The complexes of the invention have the following structural formulae EMI4.1 bis ascorbato EMI5.1 bis isoascorbato EMI5.2 bis monosaccharato EMI5.3 bis saccharato 1,4 lactone EMI6.1 bis shikimato EMI6.2 bis isethionato EMI6.3 bis 2 aminocthylsulfato EMI7.1 bis azetidinecarboxylato EMI7.2 bis prolinato EMI7.3 bis hydroxyprolinato EMI8.1 bis pipecolinato EMI8.2 Iminodiacetato EMI8.3 isocitratolactone EMI9.1 furanedicarboxylate EMI9.2 cyclopropanedicarboxylato EMI9.3 isocitratomonethylester EMI9.4 bis cyclopropanecarboxylato EMI10.1 bis cyclobutanecarboxylato EMI10.2 bis cyclopentanecarboxylato EMI10.3 bis cyclopentenecarboxylato EMI10.4 bis cyclohexanecarboxylato EMI11.1 bis cyclohexenecarboxylato EMI11.2 N phenyliminodiacetato EMI11.3 cyclohexane l,l diacetato EMI11.4 1,2 cyclopropanedicarboxylato EMI12.1 trans 1,2 cyclobutanedicarboxylato EMI12.2 trans 1,2 cyclopentanedicarboxylato EMI12.3 trans 1,2 cyclohexanedicarboxylato EMI12.4 N 2 acetamidoj iminodiacetato EMI13.1 bis 2 chloroethanesulfonato EMI13.2 bis 2 aminoethanesulfonato EMI13.3 bis glycinato EMI13.4 bis bicinato EMI14.1 N methyliminodiacetato EMI14.2 N 2 hydroxyethyl iminodiacetato EMI14.3 N benzyliminodiacetato The stoichiometric mono and bis anion DAClI platinum complexes of the invention i.e., containing one divalent anion or two monovalent anions per molecule of platinum may be prepared by reacting any suitable water soluble haloplatinate i.e., R2PtC14 with DACH to produce the intermediate, di halo DACH platinum II . The reaction is preferably effected in water at room temperature for a time sufficient to drive the reaction to completion, generally from about 6 to 8 hours. The intermediate di halo complex is normally a yellow solid precipitate which is advantageously isolated from the reaction mixture by filtering followed by washing with water, methanol and acetone. Finally, the yellow solid is dried, preferably under vacuum or is left in solution and immediately reacted therein with a sulfate. It is preferred to utilize a sulfate of a metal or cation the halo salt of which is insoluble in water to facilitate isolation of the product. Thus, where the di halo DACH platinum is the di chloro complex, it is preferred to employ Ag2SO4 thereby facilitating removal of the insoluble by product, AgCl. The reaction is preferably carried out in an aqueous medium such as water or in the reaction medium from the first step of the method at room temperature. The reaction generally gocs to completion in from about 18 to about 24 hours. Following removal of the insoluble by product halide, the intermediate sulfato DACH platinum II is isolated by evaporating the yellow filtrate to dryness, e.g., using a rotary evaporator, as a yellow brown solid which is washed, erg., with acetone and dried, preferably, in vacuum. Alternatively, the sulfato DACH platinum intermediate is left in solution and reacted therein with a soluble salt of the appropriate anion to yield the platinum complex of the invention It is preferred to utilize a metal or other cation salt of the anion whose by product sulfate salt is insoluble in water to facilitate isolation of the platinum complex. For example, the use of a barium salt of the anion yiclds barium sulfate as a by product which is readily removable from the reaction medium by filtration. The reaction is preferably conducted in an aqueous medium at about room temperature for a time sufficient to drive the reaction to completion, generally from about 0.3 to about 0.5 hours. The platinum complex may be isolated from the reaction medium by filtering the by product barium sulfate.The yellow filtrate is evaporated to dryness at 45 500C under reduced pressure, e.g., using a rotary evaporator.The yellow brown solid is then dried, e.g., over P205 under vacuum.
