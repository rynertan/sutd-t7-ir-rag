## Description
DERMOTROPIC COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to new cosmetic compost tions endowed with entrophic and moisturizing properties to be applied to skin for preventing or rep airing ageing threwf. In partIcular, the present invention relates to new cosmetic compositions suitable for strengthening hair, preventing its falling out and stimulating hair growth. It is known that cutis, due to the particular functions to which it is devoted, is structured in a particular way and is substantially comprised of two superimposed layers, namely the underlying derma and the epidermis forming the external surface of cutis. As epidermis is devoid of blood vessels, even if it has to carry out many of the most remarkable functions of the skin, such as the protective, secretive, thermore gulating, respiratory functions, and so on, metabolic impairments often occur, affecting its appearance and jeopardising its functions, also in a serious manner. It also known that hair, as the essential part of the human piliferous apparatus, is planted in epidermis, so that it also shares in a very considerable way its vicissitudes and deficiencies, and therefore falling out of hair is a more and more frequent phenomenon both in men and in women, also in not typically pathological situations.The multifactorial aetiogenesis of such a falling out, having a developing course stress, atmospheric pollution, emotional factors, washing with strongly detergent shampoos, hormonal factors, etc. is always connectable with a morphological alteration of the connective tissue surrounding the hair bulb which is determined, inter alia, by the decrease of specific acidic mucopolysaccharides heparin, hyaluronic acid,A, B, C, chondroitinsulphates in the connective tissue itself, with dehydration, consequent ageing of the tissue and dekeratinisation, together with fragility and poor elasticity of hair, and then sclerosis and death of the hair bulb. In order to prevent ageing of cutis and, particularly, falling out of hair, different criteria have been followed till now, such as the local use of degreasing, rubefacient and vasodilating agents, polyvitaminic compositions and vegatable extracts of different kinds, as well as mucopolysaccharide extracts with unspecified compositions and activity with particular reference to the anticoagulant and lipasemic activities, which are closely correlated and interdependent activities alone or in combination.However, none of these compounds has ever faced in a rational way, and consequently solved, the problem of physiological hydration of cutis and of the tissue surrounding the hair bulb, which, as above mentioned, is an essential condition for the vitality of the bulb itself and of hair. Even if the use of sulphomucopolysaccharides, which notoriously possess hydrophilic properties, is already known, it is likewise known that they usually are substan tially not absorbed through cutis. The applicant has now discovered that it is possible to provoke and facilitate the cutaneous absorption of mucopolysaccharides by mixing them with an umbilical cord extract, which is notoriusly rich in chondroitinsul phates and hyaluronic acid, obtained under particular conditions. The purpose of this invention is therefore to produce a preparation substantially based on mucopolysaccharides MPS and extract of umbilical cord ECO , able to promo te, by topical application, the hydration and trophism of skin, and particularly of hair. The present invention is based on the ascertainment that an extract of umbilical cord, besides possessing its own high hydrophilic and hydrating properties, allows the absorption of the essential MPS by skin, owing to the presence of the peptide chains of proteohyaluronic acid therein contained, which, by promoting an increase in the peripheral blood microcirculation, allows an effective absorption of the aforesaid substances. A further problem solved by this invention is that of choosing the acidic mucopolysaccharides which have to be supplied to skin and must be such as to correct the typical deficiency of these substances occurring in concomitance with falling out of hair and ageing of cutis.The MPSs chosen for topic application have furthermore to act, through their clarifying i.e. anticoagulating normolipe mising activity, as regulators for the sebaceous secretion which is a contributory cause of hair weakening and of sclerosis of hair bulb, all causes bringing to the common baldness or androgenetical or seborrhoical alopecia. The complex of extractive acidic mucopolysaccharides of animal origin according to this invention is rich in chondroitinsulphates and heparin like substances and is characterised by the following essential analytical parameters pH in 5 aqueous solution 5 to 7.5 rotatory power 0 to 150 proteins absent total N 4.5 S 6 inorganic P 0.5 hexuronic acids 20 hexosamines 20 anticoagulating activity 40 50 mg I.U.USP, XX The extract of umbilical cord to be mixed with theMPSs according to this invention is an aqueous extract of human or animal umbilical cord containing, on average, 5 to 7 g litre of hyaluronic acid, principally in the form of proteohyaluronic acid proteoglycane , and containing, moreover, C chondroitinsulphate. The hyaluronic acid, as contained in this extract, shows a molecular weight between 2.5 and 3 million. An aqueous extract of human umbilical cord shows, for instance, the following essential analytical features viscous, transparent, slightly yellowish solutionPh 5 to 7 viscosity at 300C 10 to 25 centistokes residue at evaporation 2 to 3 hyaluronic acid titre 500 to 700 mg dl ashes 0.1 to 0.5 S absent proteins 0.5 to 1.0 total N 0.15 to 0.30 aminic N 0.10 to 0.20 hexosamines 0.010 to 0.050 The process for obtaining the extract of umbilical cord according to the invention is as follows A certain quantity of umbilical cord is washed with water, crumbled by means of a triturator and conveyed into a mixer, to which a volume of water twice as much as that of the crumbled tissue is added. The obtained aqueous mush is milled and the whole is well mixed at low temperature. The mixed suspension is then filtered and the filtrate is concentrated at reduced pressure and low temperature. 4.5 of methyl para hydroxybenzoate and 0.5 of propyl parahydroxybenzoate are separately dissolved in a volume of ethanol equivalent to 5 by volume of the concentrated solution. The two solutions are mixed and filtered, and the filtrate is then sterilized by filtration through a membrane. The sterilized solution is at last closed into hermetic vessels for subsequent use. The enclosed figures 1 and 2 show the graphs obtained from two samples of extract of umbilical cord according to the present invention by high speed gas chromatography with a mobile phase consisting of an aqueous solution of KC1 0.1M buffeered at pH 7.0 with a solution of phosphate 1 15M figure 3 shows the gas chromatographic graph obtained from a standard solution containing blue dextran 2000, gammaglobulin, lactoalbumin, eggalbumin, myoglubulin and alanine in the same operational conditions. The following examples, which by no means have te be considered as limiting, illustrate the particular properties of moisture retention shown by extracts of human umbilical cord which have been used in the formulations according to the present invention, in comparison with similar properties shown by other known substances having similar characteristics. EXAMPLE 1 The tests were carried out by using the following materials A Extract of human umbilical cord HA with residue at evaporation 2.238 B Solution of sodium chondroitinsulphate CS Na with residue at evaporation 3.0 C Solution of sodium pyrrolidonecarboxylate PCA Na with residue at evaporation 3.08 Carefully weighed samples of 20 g of A, B and C, respectively placed in glass capsules having an inside diameter of 85 mm and a depth of 20 mm, were put into a drier adjusted at 300C and 80 of relative humidity.The so prepared samples were then weighed every 24 hours so as to evaluate the undergone weight changes.

The cosmetic formulations according to this invention are characterized by a number of properties which may be resumed as follows Remarkable hydrating effect on cutis, which avoids the dehydratation of the horny layer, retains water, prevents dandruff, reduces statical electricity of hair making easier the action of the comb, increases hair elasticity making hair softer ability to form membranes having greater strength and elasticity than those obtained with other products as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or gelatine, and that increases the hydrating effect and facilitates the action of the comb improvement of the subcutaneous microcirculation through topical peripheral vasodilation and permanent action on the connective tissue antibacterial activity due to a phenomenon of anionic repulsion which is typical of the extract of umbilical cord, with consequent hindran ce to the dandruff formation. The sum of these properties and characteristics allows therefore to extend the use of the formulations according to this invention to all the morphological alterations of the subcutaneous connective tissue, which are characteristic of premature ageing of skin in different cutaneous districts. Therefore, both active agents, convenient ly chosen and mixed according to this invention extract of umbilical cord and mucopolysaccharide complex and rightly conveyed and combined with other substances, differentiated according to the use and the concerned district, may be usefully employed in the different forms of chronic alopecia and particularly in the androgenetic and seborrhoic alopecia, in the treatment of dry and arid skins in order to avoid the formation of wrinkles or to attenuate the already formed wrinkles, in the topical treatment of cellulitis, owing to the vasodilating action and metabolic activation which fa vours the elimination of adipose cushions, as well as in every other non pathological skin unaesthetisms as they are sustained, in most cases, by an insufficient water content of derm. Although this invention has been described on the basis of some of its preferred embodiments, it is obvious that changes and or variations can be made by those skilled in the art, without departing from the gist and scope of the invention.
