## Abstract
In an arithmetic control unit according to the invention, which is a one chip high density semiconductor integrated element capable of controlling the prefetching of user s instructions with respect to a main memory, an arithmetic logic unit ALU 220 effects the subtraction of the content of a location counter 208 holding the location of an user s instruction to be executed next from the content of a memory address register 206 holding main memory address data, and the result of the subtraction is discrimin ated through gates 308, 309 connected to the ALU for determing whether or not to make prefetched instruction buffer content ineffective. An address matching mechanism 300 provided outside the chip of the arithmetic control unit according to the invention includes a comparator 303 for comparing an execution stop address set by an address switch 301 and the memory addresses. The output data of the comparator 303 is stored in a particular memory section 203x which is provided to correspond to the prefetched instruction buffer 203 , and when a microinstruction stored in the prefetched instruction buffer 203 is tranferred to an instruction register 202 , the data stored in the particular memory section 203x is also read out to check for the execution stop address. Further, when making access to the main memory a particular signal indicating whether the access is pertinent is externally coupled and stored in the particular memory section 203x , so that it may be read out when reading out an instruction from the prefetched instruc tion buffer 203 and an illegal address interruption may be produced when it indicates that the access is inadequate.
