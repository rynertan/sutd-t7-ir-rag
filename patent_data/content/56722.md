# VACUUM CIRCUIT INTERRUPTER WITH ON LINE MONITORING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A vacuum circuit interrupter has vapor deposition shields which is controlled by the circuit interrupter to produce a cold cathode ion detector for determining the quality or amount of vacuum within the vacuum circuit interrupter. The central shield support ring protrudes through an insulating casing to supply ion current to a current detecting bridge through a clrcumferentially insu lated surge resistor and from there to the common terminal.
