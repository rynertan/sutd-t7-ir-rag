# CIRCUITAL ARRANGEMENT ADAPTED TO GENERATE ALARM CRITERIA IN RESPONSE TO THE ERROR DETECTION IN MESSAGES EXCHANGED BETWEEN A PAIR OF FUNCTIONAL UNITS

## Abstract
The transmitting section of each functional unit is equipped with means which are designed to compute the cyclic redundance bits on the ground of the logic value of the information bits of each message and is further adapted to send the information bits, together with the associated cy clic redundance bits, to the receiving section of the commu nicating functional unit FU by way of a control unit CB . The receiving section of said functional units is equipped with means adapted to compute the cyclic redundance bits on the ground of the received messages and to send them to the control unit. This unit is designed to compute the cyclic redundance bits on the ground of the information bits of the message in transit, to compare them with the cyclic redun ance bits extracted from the message emitted by the said transmitting section as well as to generate a first alarm cri terion A₁ in case it detects the non identity in the com pared quantities. The control unit is further adapted to compute the cyclic redundance bits and to compare them with the cyclic re dundance bits computed by the receiving section should said control unit detect non identity in the compared quan tities, it generates a second alarm criterion A₂
