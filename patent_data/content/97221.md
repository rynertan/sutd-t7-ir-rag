# Rigid floppy disk cartridge.

## Abstract
A flexible magnetic recording disk 18 is nonremovably enclosed in a rigid jacket 10 . A wall 17 of the rigid jacket includes a movable wall piece 29 which operates as a disk cleaning member. The disk is clamped to a spindle collet drive assembly while the disk cleaning member is spaced from the adjacent surface of the disk. Only after clamping has been accomplished is the disk subjected to the friction force of the cleaning member.
