## Description
A SELECTABLE MARKER FOR DEVELOPMENT OF VECTORS AND TRANSFORMATION SYSTEMS IN PLANTS Crown gall formation on dicotyledonous plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the result of the transfer and covalent integration of a small segment called transfer DNA T DNA of a tumor inducing Ti plasmid into the chromosomal DNA of plant cells. The transferred T DNA is expressed in plant cells and codes for several polyadenylated transcripts. Some of the transcripts are known to be responsible for opine synthesis and for tumor growth these latter transcripts are encoded by oncogenes. None of these transcripts have been found to be essential for T DNA transfer. The transfer mechanism is thought to involve repeated nucleotide sequences present near the T DNAborders. As long as these borders are present, a foreign gene can be inserted into the T DNA of a Ti plasmid and thus engineered into the genome of a tumor cell or regenerated plant. In addition to the T DNA sequences, it is generally believed that another set of Ti plasmid genes, located outside the T DNA, termed the VIR virulence region, play a role in the mobilization of the T DNA from the bacterium to the plant cell. Heretofore, the presence of the crown gall tumor on plants infected by an Agrobacterium carrying both the T DNA and VIR regions has been the primary means of identifying transformed plant cells. This means of identification has limited commercial utility however, because whole plants can not be regenerated from crown galls containing functional oncogenes. Thus, it would be advantageous to develop a way of introducing and expressing foreign genes in plant cells without relying on tumor genes for the selection and identification of transformed plant cells. Presently, a variety of methods to introduceDNA into plant cells are available with varying degrees of success. These methods include the use of liposomes to encapsulate one or more DNA molecules, the contacting of plant cells with DNA which is complexed with either polycationic substances or calcium phosphate and protoplast fusion techniques. Currently, the preferred technique involves the utilization of Ti plasmids fromAgrobacterium cells to transfer a desired gene into a plant cell. Recently, researchers at Monsanto Company have demonstrated the availability of a co integrant Ti plasmid for use in a method for transforming plant cells. See, Fraley and Rogers, PCT Application W084 0219 .In addition, a Ti binary vector system, developed byHoekema et al., 1983, Nature 303 179, is known in the art. The aforementioned T DNA region from the Ti plasmid is available for the insertion of a desired gene which is under the control of a functional plant expression mechanism. Such chimeric genes are known in the art to express both plant and bacterial derived polypeptides. Prior to the present invention, a chimeric protein, that is, a heterologous gene which is fused to a portion or whole of a structural plant gene, had never been expressed in a plant cell. The present vector constructions provide for the production of such a chimeric protein and thus contributes to the continuing development of plant transformation systems. As demonstrated for bacterial and mammalian cells, one of the primary steps in the development of efficient transformation systems is the construction of dominant selectable markers. Such markers allow cells that have acquired new genes via transformation to be selected and identified easily. The present invention provides novel expression vectors which demonstrate that the aminocyclitol antibiotic hygromycin B can be the basis of such a selection scheme for transformed plant cells. The present invention further provides a method of selecting transformed plant cells from a background of nontransformed cells. The method allows one to add non selectable DNA to the present vectors, transform plant cells with the modified vectors and select hygromycin resistant transformants containing this otherwise non selectable DNA. Since transformation is a very low frequency event, such a functional test is a practical necessity for determining which cell s , of among millions of cells, has acquired the transformingDNA. For purposes of the present invention, as disclosed and claimed herein, the following terms are defined below. Recombinant DNA Cloning Vector any autonomously replicating agent, including but not limited to plasmids, comprising a DNA molecule to which one or more additional DNA segments can or have been added. Recombinant DNA Expression Vector any recombinant DNA cloning vector into which one or more transcriptional and translational activating sequence s have been incorporated. Amino terminal region encoding sequence the region of DNA which encodes that part of the mRNA at which translation into a polypeptide is initiated and from which a portion of the amino end of the polypeptide is translated. Chimeric protein a recoverable heterologous polypeptide which is translated from RNA coded for by a gene containing a promoter and a portion of a homologous coding region. Border Sequence DNA sequence which contains the ends of the T DNA. Broad host range replicon a DNA molecule capable of being transferred and maintained in many different bacterial cells. Conjugation the process whereby DNA is transferred from bacteria of one type to another type during cell to cell contact. Crown Gall a plant tumor caused byAgrobacterium tumefaciens. Ti plasmid a large Agrobacterium plasmid which confers the ability to induce tumors and promotes bacterial conjugation. Micro Ti Plasmid a plasmid capable of replication in Agrobacteria and containing DNA flanked by T DNA borders. Non oncogenic Strain a strain ofAgrobacterium tumefaciens which is unable to induce crown gall but retains the vir functions. Transformation the introduction of DNA into a recipient host cell that changes the genotype and results in a phenotypic change in the recipient cell. In accordance with this invention, functional and selectable micro Ti plasmids are disclosed. The hygromycin phosphotransferase aphIV gene fromEscherichia coli was inserted between the 5 promoter and associated amino terminal region encoding sequence of an octopine synthetase OCS gene and the 3 terminator sequence of a nopaline synthetase gene. These constructs were assembled between T DNA border fragments in a broadhost range vector to form the micro Ti plasmids of the present invention. The invention further provides a method of providing a hygromycin resistant plant cell and selecting the provided cell which comprises a inoculating a plant or a plant cutting with a strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing a recombinant DNA expression vector of the present invention comprising a gene which codes for hygromycin phosphotransferase and b selecting a plant cell transformed by said vector under hygromycin resistance selective conditions. Fig. 1 shows the restriction site and function map of plasmid pCEL30. Fig. 2 shows the restriction site and function map of plasmid pCEL40. Fig. 3 shows the restriction site and function map of plasmid pCEL44. Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention discloses a recombinantDNA expression vector which is functional and selectable in plants comprising 1 a transcription unit, flanked by transfer DNA border sequences, which comprises a promoter and associated amino terminal region encoding sequence and a terminator signal sequence, wherein said sequences are derived from one or more genes which are naturally expressed in a plant cell 2 an antibiotic resistance gene encoding sequence located between said promoter and associated amino terminal region encoding sequence and said terminator sequence and 3 a DNA fragment containing a replicon that is functional in Agrobacterium. In accordance with the invention, an 1.3 kbBamHI BglII fragment coding for hygromycin phosphotransferase was introduced, in both orientations, into a unique BqlII restriction site of the intermediary cloning vector, plasmid pCEL30. Plasmid pCEL30 carries the promoter transcription signal and sequences coding for the first 11 amino acids of the ocs gene. The introduction of the hygromycin phosphotransferase aphIV encoding gene was engineered to maintain the reading frame of the OCS coding region. Thus, the aphIV gene was subcloned into the BglII site of pCEL30, resulting because of the specific sequences involved in the generation of a BglII BarnHI fusion near the initiation codon of ocs.The resulting vector, plasmid pCEL40 encodes an ocs aphIV fusion protein. When the phIV gene was inserted in the opposite orientation, hygromycin phosphotransferase was not produced. A restriction site and function map of plasmids pCEL30 and pCEL40 is presented in Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings. Plasmid pCEL30 can be conventionally isolated from Escherichia coli K12 RRlAMl5 pCEL30, a strain deposited and made part of The Northern Regional Research Laboratory, Peoria, Illinois 61604. Plasmid pOW20, a source of the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene, is also deposited with the NRRL and can be readily isolated from E. coli JA221 pOW20. Both strains are avilable to the public, as a preferred source and stock reservoir of the plasmids, under the accession numbersNRRL B 15915 and NRRL B 15838, respectively. Since plasmid pCEL40 is not capable of replication in Agrobacterium, the micro T DNA of plasmid pCEL40 was first transferred, as an EcoRI fragment, into a broad host range vector pKT210. This host vector is available from the Plasmid Reference Center, StanfordUniversity, Palo Alto, California 94305. The use of a specific host range vector is not critical in the construction of the present plasmids. Other such useful vectors include, for example, pRK290 Ditta et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 77 7347 7351 and R772 Hoekema et al., 1983, Nature 303 179 180 . If properly assembled and inserted into a plant genome, a fusion protein will be expressed in the plant cell to create a desired polypeptide, such as a bacterial enzyme which confers antibiotic resistance upon the plant.Thus, the resulting micro Ti plasmid pCEL44 is extremely useful because it contains a selectable and functional plant gene for hygromycin resistance. In conjunction with the presence of a selectable and functional plant gene, the unique construction of plasmid pCEL44 confers additional beneficial attributes for use in plant transformation systems. For example, the T DNA border sequences assist in the transfer and covalent integration of the transcription unit of the present micro Ti plasmid into the chromosomal DNA of plant cells theAgrobacteria functional replicon provides an efficient means of plasmid replication and eliminates a cointegration step used by others skilled in the art and the unique SalI cloning site provides a convenient cleavage site for insertion of a gene of interest. The above illustrated vector confers hygromycin resistance to plant cells because of the presence of a functional phosphotransferase aPhIV gene. Although the particular phosphotransferase gene inserted in the above vector is an 1.3 kb BamHI BglII restriction fragment, other known phosphotransferase aphIV genes can be substituted. Such genes include, but are not limited to, those disclosed by Rao et al., 1983, AntimicrobialAgents and Chemotherapy 24 689 695. In addition, a variety of different plasmid pOW20 restriction fragments that contain the hygromycin resistance conferring gene can also be substituted provided that any of these restriction fragments are positioned such that the promoter region causes the transcription of the structural sequence.The phosphotransferase aphis gene is encoded on the 1.3 kb BamHI BglII fragment of plasmid pOW20, therefore any restriction fragment containing the aforementioned 1.3 kb BamHI BglII fragment also confers the desired resistance to sensitive plant host cells.Skilled artisans will recognize that all the above genes and fragments are functionally equivalent and thus can be used and interchanged for purposes of the present invention. Restriction fragments used to construct vectors illustrative of the present invention can be conventionally modified to facilitate ligation. For example, molecular linkers can be provided to a particular phosphotransferase aphIV containing restriction fragment, to DNA comprising the replication functions of the vector, or to DNA comprising the promoter or terminator sequences. Thus, specific sites for subsequent ligation can be constructed conveniently.In addition, any of these DNA fragments can be modified by adding, eliminating or substituting certain nucleotides to alter characteristics and to provide or eliminate a variety of restriction sites for ligation of DNA. Those skilled in the art understand nucleotide chemistry and the genetic code and thus which nucleotides are interchangeable and which DNA modifications are desirable for a specific purpose. The present invention also discloses a method providing a hygromycin resistant plant cell and selecting the provided cell which comprises a inoculating a plant or a plant cutting with a strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing a recombinant DNA expression vector of the present invention comprising a gene which codes for hygromycin phosphotransferase and b selecting a plant cell transformed by said vector under hygromycin resistance selective conditions. In accordance with the method of the invention, micro Ti plasmids, such as pCEL44, were conjugated into different strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.Triparental matings were conducted with E. coli K12 RRlAM15 pCEL44, an E. coli containing the helper plasmid pRK2013 Ditta et al., supra and A. tumefaciens LBA4013, a strain that contains a wild type Ti plasmid, pTiAch5.For purposes of this invention, the use of a specific helper plasmid or of a specific strain of A. tumefaciens is not critical. In this regard, any of the helper plasmids described in Bagdasarian et al., 1981, Gene 16 237 247 can be substituted for plasmid pRK2013, as the sole function of this kanamycin resistant helper plasmid pRK2013 is to trans complement the micro Ti plasmid for mobilization. In like manner, any oncogenic strain ofA. tumefaciens carrying a wild type Ti plasmid with a functional vir region, which is capable of transferring its own Ti plasmid to a plant cell and transforming the plant cell, can be used in the present invention. Various strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens that are suitable for use in the present invention are publicly available see, e.g., ATCC Catalogue of Strain I, p.66 15th edition, 1982 . A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes a non oncogenic, or avirulent, strain of A. tumefaciens.Such a strain can be constructed through the receipt of a Ti plasmid from which the T DNA region has been deleted.A particular strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens available for use in the present invention is A. tumefaciens LBA4404. The strain was developed by Dr. P.J.J. Hooykaas and is deposited in the Centrale Collectie van Schimmelcultures CBS at Baarn as number CBS191.83. This strain is also deposited and made part of the Northern RegionalResearch Laboratory and is available to the public under the accession number NRRL B 15920. Plant cells exposed to this strain of bacteria do not form crown galls.Instead, hygromycin resistant callus is produced which is easily regenerated into mature plants. The infection of plant tissue by Agrobacterium is a simple technique well known to those skilled in the art. Typically, a plant is wounded by any of a number of ways, which include cutting with a razor, puncturing with a needle, or rubbing with abrasive. The wound is then inoculated with a solution containing tumor inducing bacteria. In the present invention, Agrobacteria containing a binary vector system consisting of the wild type Ti plasmid and the micro Ti plasmid pCEL44 were used to incite galls on asceptic decapitated seedlings ofNicotiana tabacum cv Wisconsin 38. In addition, a non oncogenic strain of A. tumefaciens containing the microTi plasmid pCEL44 was used to induce callus production from leaf sections of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia andNicotiana tabacum cv Wisconsin 38.Both of these varieties are readily available from the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture s Tobacco Research Laboratory,Box 16G, Oxford, North Carolina 27565. The use of a cell from a specific type of plant is not critical to the present invention since a cell from any plant, into which a Ti plasmid can be transformed by Agrobacteria, can be utilized. For example, the cell can come from any dicotyledonous plant, such as, tomato, potato, tobacco, sunflower and soybean or from a monocotyledonous plant, such as members of the families, Liliaceace andAmaryllidaceae. The resultant tumorous growths were excised and DNA was isolated from representative tobacco clones, digested with BamHI and BamHI plus HindIII restriction enzymes and Southern blotted. The 1.3 kb BamHI BglII fragment conferring hygromycin resistance was nick translated for use as a hybridization probe for analysis of.the T DNA structure. A plant cell, transformed with a Ti plasmid in accordance with this invention, is used to regenerate a plant that expresses hygromycin resistance, as well as other functions, for which the Ti plasmid codes.The invention is useful for genetically modifying plant tissues and whole plants by introducing useful plant genes from other plant species or strains, such useful plant genes include, but are not limited to, genes coding for storage proteins, lectins, resistance factors against disease, insects and herbicides, factors providing tolerance to environmental stress and the like. The method, plasmids and transformants of the present invention provide plant breeders with a novel way of introducing desirable genes into plants, as well as to provide plant molecular biologists with molecular probes for studying plant development. The examples, which follow, further illustrate this invention. Example 1 Culture of E. coli RRlEM15 pCEL30 and Isolation of Plasmid pCEL30.A.

Transconjugants gave rise to individual colonies after 2 to 4 days growth. These were inoculated singly into 25 ml liquid TY medium containing 100 mg l nalidixic acid and 2 mg l chloramphenicol and incubated at 28 C with shaking for another 2 days.

Example 6 introduction and Expression of HygromycinResistance in Tobacco Crown Gall Cells Aseptic tobacco plants of cultivar Wisconsin 38 were raised as follows. Seed was sterilized by a 10 minute treatment with 10 Clorox bleach, followed by a rinse with 95 ethanol and then extensive rinsing with sterile water. Seed was planted on the surface of mediumR5, which consists of MS major and minor salts Physiol. Plant. 151473 497, 1962 , with 30 g l sucrose, 100 mg l myo inositol Sigma , 2.5 mg l thiamine HC1 Eli Lilly and Company , 2.5 mg l nicotinic acid Matheson ColemanBell , 1.25 mg l pyridoxine HC1 Lilly , and 1.25 mg, l Ca pantothenate Sigma , pH 6, solidified with 9 g lDifco Bacto agar. Germinated seeds were picked onto the same R5 medium and the plants were maintained by making vegtative cuttings approximately every 2 months intoMagenta GA7 boxes. They were grown in a lighted incubator with a day length of 16 hours, light intensity of about 150 lux, and a temperature of 260C. To inoculate with Agrobacterium, the sterile plants were decapitated and defoliated with a sterile scalpel, leaving a large wound at the apex and the cut petioles extended. Within a few minutes, a culture of Agrobacteria tumefaciens LBA 4013 pCEL44 was applied to cut surfaces until a cream brownish accumulation was visible to the naked eye. The inoculated, wounded plants were labeled, sealed in boxes, and placed back into the lighted incubator. Care was taken to insure that ambient temperature was never over 300C during gall induction. Fifteen days after inoculation, visible galls had grown out of most wound inoculation sites on the sterile Wisconsin 38 plants. These galls were cut off individually, numbered, and placed onto RS medium which had been supplemented with 200 ug ml each carbenicillin Sigma and vancomycin Vancocin HC1, Lilly . This treatment, intended to kill the tumor inciting bacteria and give aseptic cultures, invoived culturing the crown galls in the dark at 25 to 270C for three weeks on the above antibiotics, followed by another three week passage on those antibiotics. To test the response to hygromycin of these crown gall callus tissue cultures, 100 mg callus samples were placed onto Falcon 1007 petri dishes filled with about 15 ml of callus growth medium containing MS salts, 30 g l sucrose, 1 mg l thiamine HCl, 100 mg l myo inositol, 9 g l Difco Bacto agar, 1 mg l IAA indole 3 acetic acid, Sigma , 0.1 mg l kinetin 6furfurylaminopurine, Sigma , pH 6. After these samples were sterilized, the aforementioned concentrations of vancomycin and carbenicillin, and 50 pg ml of hygromycin B Lilly were added. This test was read after three weeks of incubation in the dark at 270C and positive growth phenotypes recovered. Example 7 Presence of aphIV Sequences in HygromycinResistant Gall TissuesA. Southern Blot of Plant DNA Nuclear DNA was prepared from about 10 gm of gall tissue by the method of Rivin et al. described in Maize for Biological Research pp. 161 164 ed W.F.Sheridan, publ.

Ten pg of each DNA was digested with 100 units each of BamHI and BamHI plus HindIII restriction enzymes in a 200 pl reaction of the composition recommended by the enzyme manufacturer. After 4 h incubation at 370C, the digested DNA was precipitated with 400 pl of ethanol containing ammonium acetate for 30 minutes at 700C. The DNA was allowed to dissolve overnight at 40C in 25 pl of TE buffer. The digested DNA fragments were fractionated by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to GeneScreen, a hybridization transfer membrane New England Nuclear, Boston, Massachusetts using the manufacturer s protocol.B.

The fragment is nick translated by conventional procedures see Maniatis et al., 1982 Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York using DNase I and DNA polymerase such that the probe contains about 20 pCi of 32 P dCTP per 0.2 pg of DNA.C. Hybridization to Detect aphIV Sequence Homology GeneScreen containing plant DNA fragments was prehybridized overnight at 420C in a solution containing 0.75 M NaCl, 75 mM sodium citrate, 25 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.7, 2 g l Ficoll 400, 2 g l polyvinylpyrrolidone 360, 2 g l bovine serum albumen, 1 sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 dextran sulfate, 50 formamide and 250 mg l denatured, sonicated calf thymus DNA. Hybridization was in fresh solution of the same composition but supplemented with heat denatured probe DNA 0.2 pg per 25 ml of solution . After overnight incubation at 420C, the GeneScreen membrane was washed twice with GS buffer 0.3 M NaCl, 60 mM Tris HCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8 . Each wash was performed for 1 hour at room temperature. The membrane was then washed stringently with 0.lX GS buffer supplemented with 1 SDS for 1 hour at 700C. This step was repeated and then theGeneScreen was washed twice more at room temperature with 0.1X GS buffer. The membrane was blotted dry and exposed to X ray film overnight at 700C with intensifying screens. Example 8 Regeneration of PlantsA. Regeneration from Uncloned Gall Tissue Uncloned gall tissue which had demonstrated strong growth in the presence of a restrictive level of hygromycin B was subjected to a treatment intended to induce plant regeneration under selective pressure. This treatment comprised placing pieces of callus tissue onMS medium with 0.3 mg l IAA and 10 mg l 2 ip 6 gamma, gamma dimethylallyl aminopurine, Gibco 100 mg l myoinositol, 1 mg l thiamine HC1, pH 6, 30 g l sucrose, solidified with 0.9 Difco Bacto agar plus 50 pg ml of hygromycin.These preparations were placed in a lighted incubator for one month and then dark green and budding areas of tissue were selected and transferred to the same high cytokinin, hygromycin supplemented medium again for another month of incubation in the light. Following these two passages on regeneration medium plus antibiotic, any green, budding clumps of plantlets were cut to excise single plants which were further cultured on solid mediumR5 for sterile plant growth in the light. When welldeveloped plants were obtained from three different tissue lines, the expression of the hygromycin resistance gene in these plants was tested as follows. Leaf pieces about a cm square were cut out and placed onto callus growth medium with or without hygromycin. Control tissues were leaf pieces from the aseptic Wisconsin 38 plants which were starting material for these crown gall induction experiments. These preparations were incubated in the dark at 270C. After three weeks, the Wisconsin 38 and the regenerated gall tissue plants both showed leaf cell enlargement and callus growth at the edges of the leaf piece explants in antibiotic free medium. In the antibiotic containing medium, however, the control Wisconsin 38 leaf material was unable to initiate cell division and was brown and dying, while the leaves from plants regenerated under selection pressure from hygromycin resistant gall cultures showed a cell expansion, growth and callus production comparable to the no hygromycin dishes.These results indicate that the regenerated plants contain and are capable of expressing the hygromycin resistance gene from p pCEL44. Plant media and supplements can be readily obtained from Gibco, Grand Island, New York.B. Single Cell Derived Clones from Hygromycin Resistant Galls Hygromycin resistant crown gall lines were maintained in the dark at 270C without antibiotics, with monthly subcultures on medium 1 .1 MS salts with 1 mg lIAA and 0.1 mg l kinetin, 0.9 g l Difco Bacto agar, 100 mg l myo inositol, 1 mg l thiamine HC1, 30 g l sucrose, pH 6, autoclaved to sterilize and dispensed 50 ml dish into Falcon 1005 petri dishes . Samples from these culture lines were dispersed into the same medium, which had been prepared without agar and dispensed 50 ml flask in 125 ml erlenmeyer flasks and plugged with foam stoppers. Suspension cultures initiated in this way were shaken at 135 rpm in a gyrotory shaker in the dark at 270C.After a week, the hard clumps of callus were removed and the suspension cultures of crown gall cells were passaged by dividing 1 1 into fresh liquid medium on a weekly basis. These short term suspensions can also be cultured for a month before reverting to callus clumps in the shake cultures. To generate single cell derived clones, protoplasts were prepared from these cultures and then cultivated at extremely low population density, as follows.The short term suspension cultures wre centrifuged lightly to concentrate the cells the growth medium in the supernatant was removed, and 5 ml packed cell volume of the cells was mixed with 25 ml of a filtersterilized enzyme mixture consisting of 6 w v cellulysin Onozuka R10, Kinki Yakult Mfg., Japan , 1 w v macerase Macerozyme R10, also from Kinki Yakult , 9 w v mannitol Sigma , 3 mM MES 2 N morpholion ethane sulfonic acid,Sigma , pH 5.8. The cell plus enzyme mixture was placed in a Falcon 1005 petri dish and incubated 4 hours at room temperature with slow rotary shaking at 50 rpm.When microscopic observation showed protoplast release, this preparation was filtered through wire mesh screens of aperture size 259 and 231 microns W.S. Tyler, Inc.of Mentor, Ohio , and mixed 1 1 with protoplast culture medium which had been made up to 25 w v Ficoll DL Sigma . This mixture was placed in the bottom of a A synthetic water soluble copolymer of sucrose and epichlorhydrin that has a weight average molecular weight of about 400,000. round bottom glass centrifuge tube and overlayered with a few ml of the same protoplast culture medium made up to 8 w v Ficoll, and finally, with a thin 1 2 ml layer of the protoplast culture medium made up to 2 w vFicoll. All Ficoll containing solutions had been filter sterilized. These discontinuous density gradient preparations were capped and centrifuged in a swinging bucket, ambient temperature centrifuge at 50xG for 30 minutes. The protoplasts were layered at the top and collected with a wide bore pasteur pipet at high population 5 density, 2 x 105 viable cells per ml in this experiment. The protoplast culture medium used was KP medium K3 ofKao Michayluk, Planta 120 215 227, 1974, as modified by Caboche in Mullet eft al., Physiol. Plant. 57 35 41, 1983 , made up to an osmotic strength of .5M with mannitol. Protoplasts thus collected were cultured at the high population density as collected , in aliquots of 1 ml in Falcon 3001 dishes, in the dark at 260C.After six days, they were examined for growth, cell viability as determined by exclusion of the vital stainEvans blue Sigma , and cell wall formation and divisions.Their diameter was measured under the microscope. The preparation was filtered through a 107 microns diameter wire mesh filter. The preparation was checked for the absence of cell aggregates. The cells then were serially diluted, with population density counting, to a final population density of about 100 viable cells per ml in medium C of Caboche, supra which had been adjusted to the same osmotic strength as the culture medium, using mannitol. About 15 ml per dish were plated and placed in the lighted incubator. Single cell derived colonies were obtained in a month with some cultures, and after two months with other cultures.These colonies were picked from the liquid medium with a wide bore pasteur pipet and placed on a Whatman num 3 filter paper soaked in liquid medium 1 .1. These paper supported cultures were continued in the light for another month with additions of the liquid medium to the paper when needed, followed by picking onto solid medium 1 .1 and cultured in the dark at 270C. In a test for the expression of hygromycin resistance in single cell derived callus cultures, paired samples of cloned lines of callus tissue were plated on solid medium 1 .1 with 50 pg ml hygromycin B, and on the same medium without antibiotic. After 3 weeks of culture in the dark at 270C, the two dishes were compared. In 52 out of 56 cases, the calli exhibited hygromycin resistance by growing as well with the 50 pg ml hygromycin B as without.C. Regeneration from Cloned Tissue The hygromycin resistant callus tissue cultures derived from the protoplast method of single cell cloning in section 8B can be subjected to a regenerating protocol.Callus pieces are placed on solid medium containing MS salts, 100 mg l myo inositol, 1 mg l thiamine HC1, 0.3 mg l IAA, 10 mg l 2 ip, 0.9 g l Difco Bacto agar, 30 g l sucrose, pH 6 and cultured in the light for one month.Green and budding pieces of tissue are passaged again on the same medium. Plantlets formed under this regime are passaged onto medium R5, described in section 6 above, for development into well formed plants in the light. The plants obtained are tested for the expression of the hygromycin resistance gene from plasmid pCEL44 by incubating leaf piece explants in the dark on callus growth medium containing hygromycin, as described in section 8A above. The plants demonstrate expression of the hygromycin resistance gene by showing leaf cell expansion and callus formation on the cut edges of the leaf piece explants, as in section 8A. These plants are transplanted into soil and brought to sexual maturity in the greenhouse so thatMendelian inheritance of the hygromycin resistance gene is demonstrated. This proves that the binary vector containing pCEL44 can transfer only the hygromycin resistance gene without the tumor inducing oncogenes, providing a new and useful way to engineer desired traits into plant cells which can be regenerated into sexually competent plants. Example 9 Conjugation of pCEL44 into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 A triparental cross between E coli K12 RRlAM15, E. coli pRK2013 and A. tumefaciens LBA4404 NRRL B 15920 was performed as described in Example 5.Transconjugants were selected on solidified TY medium containing 20 mg l rifampicin and 2 mg l chloramphenicol. Example 10 Introduction and Expression of HygromycinResistance in CallusA. Nicotiana plumbaginifolia Seeds of N plumbaginifolia were sterilized by a brief exposure to ethanol followed by a 3 minute treatment with 0.5 Chlorox bleach. After rinsing with sterile water the seeds were incubated for 1 hour in a solution containing 0.5 mg ml gibberillic acid. Next, the seeds were planted on MS medium solidified with 0.6 Phytagar.Plants were grown at 279C with a daylength of 16 hours at a light intensity of about 700 lux. Leaf sections of about 1 sq cm were cut from 3 month old plants and the cut edges were smeared with a culture of Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 pCEL44.The infected sections were incubated on solidified MS medium containing 1 mg l napthaleneacetic acid NAA and 0.1 mg l benzyladenine BA for 3 days in the dark at 270C. The sections were then transferred to the same medium supplemented with 200 mg l vancomycin and 200 mg l carbenicillin. After growth for one month, pieces of callus were transferred to MS medium with 1 mg mlNAA, 0.1 mg ml BA and 50 mg l hygromycin B and the incubation continued. After 3 weeks, small pieces of callus were inoculated onto solidified MS medium supplemented with 0.1 mg l NAA and 1 mg l BA and incubated at 270C in the light with a 16 hour day to regenerate shoots. The shoots are transferred to solidified MS medium without supplements to promote root growth. B. Nicotiana tabacum A portion of a tobacco callus suspension culture,NT575, was poured onto solid media described in Example 8C . After excess water was removed, a feeder layer system was constructed wherein two layers of sterilizedWhatman num 1 filter paper were placed over the cells. The cells were incubated in the dark at 260C overnight. A culture of Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 pCEL44 was grown up on TV media with 2 mg l chloramphenicol. Isolates were transferred into a liquid medium containing 5 g l casein hydrolysate and 3 g l yeast extract, and shaken overnight at 260C in a gyrotory shaker. Leaf sections of about 1 sq cm were cut from 3 month old plants and soaked in the liquid overnight bacterial culture for 6 8 minutes, blotted dry and placed onto the filter paper cover of the above prepared feeder layer system. The leaf pieces were incubated in the light at 260C for two days1 and then picked off and placed on regeneration medium plus 200 pg ml each carbenicillin and vancomycin. After an additional 12 days in the light on this medium, the leaf pieces were moved onto the same medium with 50 pgfml hygromycin. These plates were cultured in the light of 260C for an additional 3 months. Plantlets were regenerated and grew out on the hygromycin containing medium from the treated leaf pieces. Pieces which had been treated in the same way but with Agrobacteria containing the hygromycin resistance gene in an inverted orientation gave no plantlets. Plants are picked from these leaf sections, grown in hormone free R5 medium and tested for hygromycin resistance by explanting leaf pieces onto callus growth medium containing 50 pg ml hygromycin B in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 8A. Similarly, leaf sections are treated as taught above, except that callus growth medium Example 10A is used in place of the regeneration medium. These leaf sections are grown in callus growth medium supplemented with 200 pg ml each vancomycin and carbenicillin. These preparations are incubated in the dark at 260C for 2 weeks and then moved to the supplemental medium containing 50 pg ml hygromycin B. Hygromycin resistance is proven by growing callus on antibiotic containing media and by probing Southern blots of the plant DNA with the IV sequence as taught in Example 7.
