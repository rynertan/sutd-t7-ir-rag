# A METHOD OF FORMING A SHALLOW DOPED REGION IN A SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATE

## Abstract
A shallow not more than about 30nm deep doped region 24 is formed in a semiconductor substrate 10 by depositing at least two overlayers 12, 14 on the top surface of the semiconductor substrate, one 14 of the overlayers containing metal atoms. The overlayers are such that a metal compound is formed from the metal atoms in one 14 of the overlayers and atoms from another one 12 of the over layers when the multilayered structure is annealed at a temperature less than 700 C. At least one 12 of the overlayers contains atoms to be introduced as a dopant into the substrate. When the multilayer structure is annealed at a tempera ture less than 700 C the metal compound is formed and releases the atoms to be introduced into the substrate. This produces an interface 18 which moves towards the subs trate and pushes the released atoms by the snowplow effect towards the substrate. The annealing is continued for a time sufficient to move the interface 18 to the top surface of the substrate to push the released atoms into the body of the substrate.
