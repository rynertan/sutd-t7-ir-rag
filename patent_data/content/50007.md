# A heat resistant adenylate kinase, a stable immobilized adenylate kinase composite material, and processes for their production.

## Abstract
A heat resistant adenylate kinase is described whose activity after an incubation in a buffer solution at about 50 C for about 15 minutes is at least about 80 of the original activity prior to the incubation. This adenylate kinase can be obtained by cultivating a bacterium belonging to the genus Bacillus and collecting adenylate kinase from the resulting culture broth. This heat resistant enzyme is very stable against heat and, therefore, after isolation, it can be stored for a long period of time compared with the conventional adenylate kinase.
