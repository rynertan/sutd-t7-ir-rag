## Abstract
Method for uniting a plastics fixation part 1 with a sealing body 2, comprising a head end 3 and a sealing sleeve 4, by first moulding the sealing body 2 and sub sequently moulding the plastics fixation part 1 around the head end 3 of the sealing body 2, thereby protecting the sealing sleeve 4. The fixation part 1 is provided with corrugations 12a, 13a for connecting the fixation part with a socket pipe 21 provided with corrugations on its outer side. The method may be carried out in an apparatus com prising a first mould part 5, a second mould part 6 and a third mould part 7, forming together a moulding space 8, 8a for forming the sealing body and a fourth mould part 10 replacing the first mould part 5, forms a moulding space 11 for moulding the fixation part 1.
