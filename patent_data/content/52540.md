# Molded plastic connector.

## Abstract
An electrical connector assembly that is comprised of two integral pieces 10 and 20 bonded together to form the entire electrical connector assembly. Integral with one of the pieces 10 and 20 are plurality of resiliently deflectable fingers 15 or 25 that prevent withdrawal of a contact 30 after it has been inserted in the passage 11 in the connector assembly.

## Claims
Claims 1. A molded plastic connector characterized by A first integral molded piece comprising a first member 10 having a rear portion and a front portion that includes a front face 17 and means for receiving at least one electrical contact 30 , said means including a passage 11 in said member for each contact, said passage terminating in a plurality of forwardly facing resiliently deflectable fingers 15 forming a truncated cone A second integral molded piece comprising a second member 20 having a front portion and rear portion having a rear face and means for receiving at least one electrical contact, said means including a passage 21 for each contact in said member, each passage including an enlarged passage portion in the rear portion of the passage said enlarged portion including a rearwardly facing shoulder 22 and means for bonding the front face 17 of said first molded piece 10 to the rear face 27 of said second molded piece 20 whereby said first and second pieces are bonded together with each of said passages in said first molded piece aligned with a respective passage in the second molded piece and an electrical contact 30 mounted in each of said passages, each contact having a rearwardly facing shoulder which is engaged by the end of the fingers 15 to prevent rearward movement of the contact and a forwardly facing shoulder which engages the rearwardly facing shoulder 22 in said passage to prevent forward movement of said contact.

## Description
MOLDED PLASTIC CONNECTOR This invention relates to electrical connectors and more specifically connectors molded from plastic. An electrical connector assembly is generally comprised of two separate housings, each having contacts mateable with contacts in the other when the housings are connected together by a coupling member. The contacts are generally mounted within the connector housing by a contact retention mechanisms which generally includes a plurality of individual pieces sandwiched together within a connector housing. Examples of such connectors may be found in U.S. Patents 3,165,369 issued January 12, 1965, entitled Retention System for Electrical Contacts and 3,805,379 issued April 23, 1974, entitled Method ofAssembling an Electrical Connector to Effect a PreloadingThereof . One of the principal uses of these types of connectors is on aircraft where upwards of 100 connectors or more may be used. As with any aircraft component, weight is an important consideration. Obviously, another consideration is the cost of the component. Accordingly, where possible, connectors made from plastic are being utilized. However, as shown in the above identified patents such plastic connectors still have complex internal portions that are separately mounted within the connector housing. Disclosure of the Invention This invention provides a low cost, light weight electrical connector comprised of plastic. The invention is an electrical connector characterized in that it is comprised of two one piece plastic segments bonded together. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a low cost, light weight electrical connector. It is another object of this invention to provide an electrical connector that is comprised of as few pieces as possible. It is another object of this invention to provide an electrical connector that is comprised of only two pieces bonded together. Detailed Description of the Invention FIGURE 1 illustrates one segment of an electrical connector. FIGURE 2 illustrates the other segment of an electrical connector. FIGURE 3 illustrates an electrical connector embodying the principles of the invention. FIGURES 4 and 5 illustrate alternate embodiments to the two segments of the connector assembly shown inFIGURES 1 and 2. Referring now to the drawings, FIGURE 1 illustrates one segment 10 of an electrical connector assembly. The segment 10 includes a rear portion having threads 13 thereon and a forward portion having a forward face 17 and an annular shoulder 16. The forward portion further includes a plurality of passages 1 1 each terminating in an end portion comprised of a plurality of resiliently deflectable fingers 15 that form a truncated cone. This forms part of the contact retention mechanism and are further described in the aforementioned Patent 3,165,389.Each passage 11 is adapted to receive a contact, the mating portion of which may be pushed through the passage from the rear to radially deflect the fingers 15 which then snap behind a rearwardly facing shoulder of the contact. FIGURE 2 illustrates the other segment 20 of a connector assembly. This segment 20 includes a passage 21 that terminates an enlarged passage portion that includes a rearwardly facing shoulder 22 a front portion and a rear portion having a rear face 27. On the forward portion of this segment are one or more key 23 for aligning this half of the connector assembly with another half of a connector assembly not shown . FIGURE 3 illustrates the segments 10 and 20 shown inFIGURES 1 and 2 joined together to form an electrical connector assembly. The two segments may be bonded or cemented together with an appropriate bonding agent, ultrasonically welded, laser welded or bonded with an epoxy. A contact 30 is shown mounted in the passage 11 and 21 and is retained in the passage by fingers 15 and rearwardly facing shoulder 22 which captivate the enlarged portion of the contact 30. FIGURES 4 and 5 illustrate an alternate embodiment to the segments shown in FIGURES 1 and 2. In this embodiment the contact retaining fingers 25 are an integral part of the forward segment 20. Further, the annular shoulder 26 is on the forward segment 20.Accordingly, the rear segment 10 includes a passage 11 that has a forwardly facing shoulder 12. When these two pieces are bounded together the contact would be inserted from the front of the connector assembly through passage 21 until the large portion of a contact not shown snaps into place in front of the forwardly facing shoulder 12 and behind the ends of the resiliently deflectable fingers 25. While a preferred embodiment of this invention has been disclosed, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that changes may be made to the invention as set forth in the appended claims, and in some instances, certain features of the invention may be used to advantage without corresponding use of other features.Accordingly, it is intended that the illustrative and descriptive materials herein be used herein to illustrate the principles of the invention and not to limit the scope thereof.
