# EXPANDABLE MAPPED MEMORY CONTROL

## Abstract
Memory mapping circuitry for a computer random access memory is disclosed in which memory size can be increased in discrete steps by inserting additional memory integrated circuits and connecting appropriate jumper wires. At each memory size, the mapping circuitry allows full use of the available memory yet prevents a user from accessing non existing memory locations. The mapping circuitry can also configure the memory into four configurations each of which can be selected under software control. Memory mapping is performed by two programmable aray logic circuits. One of the circuits is permanently connected to the memory map ping circuitry and is equipped with jumper terminals to tailor the mapping circuitry to the memory size. The other prog rammable array logic circuit is inserted only if the largest memory size is used.
