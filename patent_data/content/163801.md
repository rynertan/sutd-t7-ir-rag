# Machinery for the conversion of solar energy into electrical or mechanical energy.

## Abstract
The machinery consists of a paraboloid concentrator c with trapeziform sectors which is mounted onto a mobile structure, supported by three pedestals, which follows the apparent motion of the sun from East to West, through a circular section t connected to the vertex o of the con centrator c perpendicularly to the earth s axis en es while the synchronization to the solar declination, 23 27 , is attained through a spirally wound biconical reel z or zl . A logical control system, appropriately programmed, opera tes the various parts of the machinery once this has been orientated. A motor m2 starts off the transmission system which causes the concentrator c to undergo a rotational displacement, from East to West, at a speed of 15 an hour. When the run is finished, the logical control system or simply the switch io reverses the direction of trans mission and the concentrator c returns to its original posi tion, ready to point towards the sun the next day while the end of run switch ie is used to stop the machine. A correct ing system for the solar declination, the electro mechanical group mb,v2,r3 spirally wound biconical reel zl enables the paraboloid c to be orientated, day by day, in order to attain the maximum capture of energy from the rays which is then concentrated onto a boiler Ca which is placed on the focal point of the concentrator c .

## Description
Description of the industrial invention entitled MACHINERY FOR ThtE CONVERSION OF SOAR ENERGY INTOELECTRIC OR MECHANICAL ENERGY by Giuseppe FARINA, of Italian nationality.The solar machinery which is the subject of this invertior allows one to transform solar energy into electric or mechanical energy. The machinery consists of a paraboloid concentrator c with trapeziforn sectors which is mounted onto a mobile structure, supported by three pedestals, which fol lo the apparent motion of the sun from East toWest, through a circular section t connected to the vertex o of the concentrator c perpendicu larly to the earth s axis en es while the synchronization to the solar declination, 230 27 , is attained through a spirally wound conical reel z or zl . A logical control system, appropriately programmed, operates the various parts of the machinery at certain moments. The machinery, once orientated towards the astronomical poles and synchronized according to the latitude of the area, as well as to the sun s rays, is set in motion by activating a sitch placed in pt . The motor m2 starts off the transmission system which causes the concentrator c to undergo a rotational displacement, from East to West, at a speed of 150 an hour.When the run is finished, the logical control system or simply the switch io reverses the direction of transmission and the concentrator c returns to its original position, ready to point towards the sun the next day. The switch io is placed in pf fibres 1 5 and is operated using the arm lo which is positioned under c while the switch ie figure 5 is used for stopping the movement. As well as the above mentioned motion, the machinery produces a further motion that synchronizes the concentrator e to the solar declination. In these conditions of synchronisn, the solar rays converge onto the zone of focus where a boiler Ca , or elements that make use of solar energy such as the hot air Stirling engine with internal focusing, is situated. PRESET STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGYAs far as small and medium powers are concerned, in other words up to about 500Kw, there is a tendency, in the present state of the technology, to employ parabolic cylinder reflectors or paraboloid reflectors both in the production of thermal energy and in the generation of electricity. However, while the spot paraboloids are very costly, due to the difficulty in constructing and in transporting them, the parabolic cylinders are on the other hand easy to construct, but they give a very low efficiency and low temperatures. The paraboloid c , with trapeziform elements, appears to be the optimal solution, since its cost is not very different from that of the parabolic cylinders, while its performance is noticeably improved greater overall efficiency of the system and a higher storage temperature. The structural support of the machinery, which is different fro those realized so far, allows the adoption of concentrators having any width, without any reduction in reliability as far as the synchronization with the apparent motion of the sun is concerned. Further characteristics are ease in construction and in assembling the individual trapeziform sections ease in transport, due to the fact that the surface of the concentrator nay be reduced to plane sheets.The solar machinery in question, as well as being of undoubted industrial interest, also provides didactic material and gives the opportunity of improving the techniques for sighting the sun and for following it. DESCRIPTIVE TT The invention is describe with reference to the attached diagrams Tables 1 2 3 4 which illustrate a particular realization of the solar machinery, whose coleponents are A The proposed concentrator c which consists of many sections of reflecting material, of trapeziform shape cl table 1 figure 2, which are assembled on the load carryinW structure h which consists of an equal number of frames of the same shape for receiving them hl figure 2. A boiler Ca is attached by supports s to the focal point of the concentrator c . On the extremities of the arms, bn and bs table 1 figure 1 and table 4 figures 7 9, which support the rollers q , the double and parallel guides of circular section an as slide. These guies, rigidly connected to the structure of the paraboloid, have their centre at the vertex o of the concentrator c . In the vertex of the concentrator c a structure k is mounted, which is composed of two flat arms parallel to the optical axis of c tables 2 3 figures 3 6. The virtual segment, that joins the centres Ck of the arms k ,passes through the vertex of the concentrator c and is perpendicular to the segment en es . The structure k is connected in a mobile way to the end of the arm f of the circular sector t table 3 figures 8 5 through the axis y , in such a way that the concentrator c is free to oscillate around its axis of rotation keeping the point o in a constant position in space.B In the circular sector t table 3 figures 5 8 the arm f , which forms one of its radii, causes with its motion rotational displacements of the paraboloid about the point o on a perpendicular plane to the North South axis. The arc of the circular sector t , an overturned in section or of different section , is passed through a pair or more than one pair of rollers w wl which are perfectly adherent to the surface of the base t figure 5 and on its central part, for the total length of the arc, it secures a gearing chain u which is coupled to the gear wheel rl or in the case of an indented arc it could be coupled to the two external cylinders of the group of indented rollers Grl figures 5 8 8a. Under these conditions the sector t rotates on a plane perpendicular to the North South line en es . During the rotational motion of the circular sector t , the boiler moves from East to West and vice versa. C The circular sector guides an as , tables 1 4 figures 1 7 9, run along the rollers q of the L shaped arms Bn Bs by the rotational axes of the pivots en es lying along tie North South axis about which they are free to rotate. The arms 3n Bs and Bf are supported by the pedestals pn ps and pf through the coupling Q . It remains understood that the length of the pedestals depends on the latitude of the installation area thus guaranteeing the system to capture the rays fron the sun from dawn until dusk. Therefore, during rotation the arms bn and bs rerain on perpendicular planes to the North South axis. The extremities of the arms Bn Bs and of the central arm Ef are connected to their respective pedestals by rears of centre staffs around which they are free to rotate and which maRr be fixed, in the position necessary for orientating the structure, by means of pivots that pass through circular section slots with centre 4 . B The position of the central fork Bf table 3 figure 5, which depends on the orientational requirements of the machinery, as well as ensuring the transmission connection with the circular sector t , guarantees the rotational motion of the same sector on a plane perpendicular to the North South axis and which passes through the point 0 of the concentrator. The rotational motion of the circular sector t is caused by the wheel rl , or the two external cylinders of the group of indented rollers Grl table 3 figures 5 8 Sa, licl is controlled t the transmission parts formed by the wheel r2 and the tangent screw vl table 3 figure 5. On the body y of the fork Bf the switches io and ie are placed, which are respectively controlled by the levers lo le fixed to the paraboloid, and which are used in order to reverse the run and then to halt it. E The spirally wound double conical reel z or zl table 2 figure 4, which is connected to the interior of the section arms bs figure 9, has the purpose of winding or of unwinding different lengths of string dl , at different times of the year, sufficient to case the concentrator c to decline in te vertical plane. The string dl is connected on the one side to the point t of the reel zl , anrffi on the other side to the extremity is of the sector as , sliding along a circular surface tor which ensures regular sliding tables 1 4 figures 1 9a. Along the axis s and from the side opposite the wheel r3 a similar reel zl not shown in the figure nay be joined by mortise, whose string not illustrated attached to the extremity jsl opposite that where the string dl is attached, winds up in the opposite sense with respect to the latter. This two reel system ensures, in the case of external forces wind , that the paraboloid does not invert its sense of motion, since one or the other of the reels will become taut. The string d2 , which is attached to the point jn of the paraboloid, partially winds round the axis of the roller pun of the arm bn and through the hollow axis en of the latter its other extremity reaches the counterweight g figures 7 11. The reel zl is controlled by a tangent screw v2 figure 9, detail in figure 10 , through the transmission wheel r3 fixed on the axis of rotation of zl . The transmission unit is set into motion by the electric motor reducer m4 which is activated, preferably every day, by the logical control system. For example, every day the axis of the motor m4 , having caused the axis v2 to perform a complete eycle, is stopped because a switch iz , controlled by the lever lz mounted on the axis v2 , stops the flow of electricity. This rotation, which occurs by means of the mechanism just described, de termites a movement of the arms bn bs which causes thanks to the position of the string dl in the reel zl a pre established rotation of the paraboloid c which in this way corrects the daily deviations of the apparent declination of the sun.To the end of the tangent screw v2 , table 4 figures 9 9a 1O, an eccentric cylindrical element of elliptic cross section re is joined by mortise, which acts as a cam on the surface of the throat of the lever lr of known curvature, having some projections on its back s 0d and whose fulcrum is at Cm . This curvature is calculated so that the projections on it, at the end of the nm, act on thelevers Fs Fd , of the braking system, in such a way that these, whose fulcra are at the points cos Cd lying along a straight line parallel to the axis s , rotate with the sar e angle, causing an equal braking effect of the respective dogs on the cylindricnl circular guides as . Once the string dl has been wound up or unwound , and thus the system has been set in the desired position, the cam element re places itself with its major axis perpendicular s thus activating the lever lr .
