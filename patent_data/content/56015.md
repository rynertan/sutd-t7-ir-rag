# Radiolabelled substrates for assaying mammalian enzymes.

## Abstract
Compounds which are substrates for mammalian en zymes, especially proteolytic and peptidase enzymes, are disclosed. These compounds, in general, have the general formula X T, W Y or X Pep Y, wherein X is a radiolabelled benzoyl or hydroxyphenylpropanoyl group, T is the NH residue of a known chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate comprising at least one amino acid group which may be substituted with other organic groups, Y is a radiolabelled benzylamine group, W is the residue of a known chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate comprising at least one amino acid group which may be substituted with other organic groups, and Pep is a difunctional or polyfunctional residue from a known chro mogenic or fluorogenic substrate comprising at least two amino acid groups in peptide linkage, which residue may be substituted with other organic groups.
