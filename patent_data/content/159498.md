# Coordinate input device with display.

## Abstract
A coordinate input device with a display has a tablet 100 having two orthogonal position detecting sections each having elongated magnetic bodies and a plurality of exciting lines and a plurality of detecting lines which are arranged alternatingly such as to cross the magnetic bodies orthogonally thereto. These position detecting sections are superposed such that their magnetic bodies, exciting lines and detecting lines cross orthogonally. A tabular display 300 is superposed on the tablet. The device further has a position appointing magnetism generator 200 adaptet for imparting local biases to the exciting lines of the position detecting sections. The exciting lines of the tablet are sup plied with A.C. current of a predetermined frequency by a driving current source 400 . A position detecting circuit 500 is designed for detecting the coordinate values of a position appointed by the position appointing magnetism generator through detection of voltages induced in the de tecting lines in the tablet. The display is driven by a display control circuit 600 . The operation of the above mentioned constituents is controlled by a processor 700 . With this arrangement, it is possible to input coordinate data to the tablet by the position appointing magnetism generator with a high precision and by a simple operation from a remote position above the tablet, and the coordinate data or image information formed by these coordinate data can be visually checked directly on the display.
