# Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene or chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymer.

## Abstract
A copolymer comprising monomeric units derived from ethylene, tetrafluoroethylene or chlorotrifluoroethylene and a fluorovinyl compound of the formula CH₂ CFRf I wherein Rf is a C₂ C₁₀ fluoroalkyl group, a molar ratio of ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene or chlorotrifluoroethylene being from 40 60 to 60 40 and the content of the fluorovinyl compound being from 0.1 to 10 by mole having improved thermal resistance and high temperature mechanical proper ties such as crack resistance.
