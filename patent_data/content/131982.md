# Method and apparatus for displaying and reading out an image.

## Abstract
An apparatus and technique are described for storing a latent radiation image on a photoconductor 1 by way of charge produced on the photoconductor and absorption of light 4 from an object 5 transmitted onto the photconduc tor. Read out is provided by scanning a light source 9 over the photoconductor to create a photocurrent which activates a CRT read out device or is stored in an image recording system.
