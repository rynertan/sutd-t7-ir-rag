# A semiconductor device having a leadless chip carrier.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprises a semiconductor chip 10 , enclosed in a leadless chip carrier 1 to one side of which the chip is attached, with a cap 8 cover ing the semiconductor chip. A heat sink plate 21a or 21b which is electrically connected to the semiconduc tor chip 8 is provided on the opposite side of the lead less chip carrier 1 , thereby improving heat dissipation and facilitating improvements in packing density of such devices.
