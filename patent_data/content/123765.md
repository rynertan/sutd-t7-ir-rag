## Description
Shaving cream holder 1ncororate.d in safety razorsThe invention concerns a container for shaving cream under pressure, applied as the handle of safety razors and holding in a separate section a small quantity of after shave lotion as well.It is known that in current use are safety razors made completely of plastic, except for the blade, in order to be used for a few shaves 15 8 and then discarded,Ã§articular1y suitable for travellers and other user who are not in their homes.Another ch.aracteristic of said razors is that they are very small, however their great practicality is almost completely cancelled out by the need to carry, eventually in small travel bags, the can of pressurized shaving cream which., in contrast, is always of considerable size, containing enough material for approximately pne hundred shaves.The aim of the invention is to realize a product of extreme practicality and low cost, containing in a single compact unit all the elements necessary for a limited number of complete shaves.This aim is achieved with the device according to the invention, consisting of a container, joined or applicable to the head of a safety razor, of apnroximately the same dSrmensionsr as the normal handle, filled with a small quantity of shaving cream under pressure, supplying a few shaves, corresponding to those obtainable with the blade incorporated in said razor head, and equiPPed with an outlet valve of known type, placed on the bottom or in correspondence with the head attachment.As a variation the inside space of the container may be divided into two separate compartments, each characterized by the presence of its own outlet valve, so that it may contain in addition to the cream, a small quantity of after shave lotion, so that it makes up a single compact unit including blade, cream and lotion, that is the three components necessary to effect the shaves.The invention is shown in some preferred purely exemplificative embodiments in the attached figures, which show figure 1, an axonometric view of a safety razor with the device incorporated, figure 2, the rear view of an embodiment with outlet valve on the top figure 3, the verticle section of an embodiment with a throw away container figure 4, the view and partial section of a variant with a rechargeable container. The drawings show in detail the preferably cv.lindrica or prismatic hollow body 1, of the shaving creams container 2, joined on construction in the upper portion 3, with the head 4 of the throw away type safety razor and equipped with valve 5 for outlet of the contents on the bottom end, so that it may be discarded with head 4 and container ss once it has been used.As a variation the container a may have an upper valve 6 placed near the attachment 3 of the head 4 and the safety razor.As a further variation, the head 8 of the razor may be of the non throw avay type, equipped with changeable blades 9 the container device 10 may thus be screw on, with 7 in 11, or attached in same other way so it can be discarded when empty. Furthermore, figure 4 shows a variant of container 12, fixed incorporated or assemblable, to the head 8 of the razor, but not throw away because it can be refilled through the cream inlet valve 13, by means of transferring the cream from spray can 14, through its outlet valve 5. In all the variations, a portion of the container separate from that of the cream, can be filled with after shave lotion, to be removed through a separate valve distinct from that for the cream. Qf course, while the principle of the finding remains the same, the shapes and details of construction may be varied widely from that described and illustrated here, without going beyond the bounds of the present invention
