# Daylight loading system for microfiche cassettes.

## Abstract
A daylight loading device 40 for loading a microfiche cassette 10 with unexposed microfiches makes use of an inclined platform 50 having guides 51 and 52 upon which the microfiche cassette 10 may be positioned. Microfiches are fed from an adjacently positioned dispensing station 43 via a slot 46 and a transport roller pair. In order to provide for an optimum registering of the microfiche in the bottom of the microfiche cassette 10 a spade like element 55 is temporarily positioned near the latter. A mechanism is provided for re locking the microfiche cassette 10 after loading.
