## Description
The present invention relates to a container distributing or dispensing unit for matches, in particular wood matches. As it is known, matches are packaged and sold in small boxes, envelopes or the like,which containers are provided, on the sides whereof, with one or ore strips provided with a roughened and suitably processed surface effective to allow for matches to be struck. It is also known that conventional wood matches, which are usually used in kitchens,are contained in poor strength box like members which,upon opening and hancling,are susceptible to quick destruction. Moreover7 because of the mentioned poor strength of the known match boxes, also the roughened strips applied thereon are susceptible to easy destruction, thereby loosing their efficiency. In order to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks,match holders are presently used which latter,however,are arranged at a fixea position near to ie gas stove or the like cooking apparatus. Moreover, in conventional match holders, which usually consist of a box like body open at the top, the drawback further usually arise that more than a single match may be removed, and some matches are susceptible to fall on the underlying surfaces and into pots located on the cooking plate. Accordingly, the task of the present invention is to overcome the thereinabove mentioned drawbacks by providing such a match distributing or dispensing container which is effective to contain in the inside whereof a number of matches, while beiag effective to be brought to the match use position without any dangers of matches exitiag therefrom. Within that task, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide such a match distributing or dispensing container which is effective to allow for a single match at a time to be dispensed. Another object ef the present invention is to provide such a match dispensing container which is provided with means erfective to allow for the dispensed match to be easily struck. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a match dispensing container whereinto matches may be easily introduced from the starting package thereof. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a match dispensing container which is of great constructional strength and which,accordingly,may be used for a long period. According to one aspect Qf the present invention, the thereinabove mentioned task and objects, as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a match distributing or dispensing container, characterized in that it comprises a box like body provided with a lug defining at least a dihedral surface, coplanarily extending with respect to the walls whereof and thereto a closure bottom member is effective to be coupled which is provided with at least a perimetrical interrupted portion. adore specifically the mentioned box like body may have either a triangular,square,pentagonal, nexagonal or a generally prismatic cross section, or a substantially round cross section as provided with longitudinally extending inner slots effective to define at least a guiding channel tor gulding the individual matches. The mentioned closure bottom tor said box like body,as it is of poligonal cross section, is provided, at one at least of me corners tnereoi, with an interrupted or cut througn portion effective to allow for an individual match to pass therethroug . moreover said box like body is preferably made by injection moulding a plastics material having such a hardness which,in combination with a suitably roughened portion,at the corner of the mentioned dihedral lugs,is efiective to assure a great duration. It should also be noted that, at the corner of tne mentioned aihedral lugs,a a suitable phosphoric mixture layer may be applied for striking amorphous or sarety matches. Finally, the mentioned box like body with a lug defining one or more dihedral surfaces, and the related closure bottom member, may also be obtained as a singe piece. further characteristics and a vantages of the match distributing or dispensing container according to the present invention will become more apparent tnereiafter from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof, being illustrated in the several figures of the accompanying drawing, where Fig.l is a perspective view illustrating a typical and preferred embodiment of the match distributing or dispensing container according to the present inventioa,with the bottom member disengaged from the box like body of the container Fig.2 illustrates that same dispensing container with the blotto member thereof associated with the box like body Fig.3 illustrates the use procedure for practically using the match dispensing container according to the present invention Figs.4 and 5 illustrate a dispensing container provided with a lug defining a double dihedral Fig.6 illustrates a round cross section match distributing or dispensing container and Fig.7 illustrates an exploded perspective view or the match dispensing container according to the present invention,with the cover member thereof separated from the box like body Fig.8 is a cross sectional view illustrat ing the matcn dispensing container of fig.7 Fig.9 illustrates a perspective view of the match dispensing or distributing container illustrated in fig.1. With reverence to the aumbers of the figs 1 to 5, the match distributing or dispensing container according to the present invention comprises a box like body 1 having a square cross sectiox,which is provided with a lug 2, defining one or more dihedral surfaces 3,extending at corresponding corners thereof and with faces coplanarily extending with respect to the walls thereof. With the mentioned box like body 1 there is associated a closure bottom member 4, having a related shape to the cross section of said box like body 1 and provided, at at least an apex whereof, with a structural interruption 5 effective to define a port or opening for the passing therethroug of one of the matches 6,as preliminarily arranged inside said box like body. o e inner portion of the mentioned dihedral surfaces there are formed, at the corner thereof, roughened portions 7 effective to allow for matches to be struck by rubbing. More specifically, the above mentioned roughened portions may be either directly formed on said dihedral surfaces,by means of a suitable surface finishing operation, or they may be realized by applying strips of a suitable material,as coated by suitable phosphoric mixtures. Moreover,in the case of a matcn container proviaea with a double dihedron forming lug see figs.4 and 5 ,the bottom member may be rotated ia such a way as to present its opening or port 5 at either one or the other roughened surface 7 . That approach allow for the duration of the match dispensing container to be extended up to the complete consumption of the rubbing surfa ces. In fig.3,in particular,there.is illustrated a match dispensing container 1 of cylin drical shape,with related closure bottom member 4 and concave lug 2 . In this embodiment, there is provided a box like body having at least an inner longitudinal slot, as formed at the axis of the mentioned concave lug and effective to guide matches toward the opening or port 5 of said bottom member. Finally,with reference to figs.7,8 and 9 there is illustratea a match distributing or dispensing container provided with a box like member 10 opea at the top and thereto a cover member 11 may be snap applied. Said box like member 10 is provided with a first portion defined by the small walls 12 and 13 for containing matches and a second portion having an abrading surface 14 for striking matches. In the first portion there is provided a lower panel 15 which, cooperating with an upper panel 16 extending from the cover 11, is effective to define a labyrinth path for causing individual matches to exit an opening consisting of an interrupt ed portion 17 provided on the small wall 13 located on the side of the abrading surface 14. Moreover, in order to further broaden the match striking zone,rougnened portion 20 are provided also on the outer surface of the box like member 10. From the above disclosure and the several figures of the accompanying drawings the great functionality and use facility characteriz ing the match distributixg or dispensing container according to the present invention will be self evident.
