# TAPE READER WITH REEL.

## Abstract
The safety of a tape reader with reels is improved. An outermost side detector 101 on the supply side and an outermost side detector 102 on the take up side determine whether corresponding tension arms 3 , 4 are at their respective outermost positions. A detection circuit 103 determines whether or not a tape is stretched from reel to reel on the basis of the results of detection by the detectors 101 , 102 . When the detection circuit 103 detects the fact that no tape is stretched from reel to reel, a control means 100 suspends both a reel motor 7 on the supply side and reel motor 8 on the take up side.

## Description
S P E C I F I C A T I O N TAPE READER WITH REELS TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to improvement in a tape reader with reels, and more particularly to a tape reader with reels which is capable of automatically stopping reel motors when no tape is being stretched between the reels. BACKGROUND ART In a tape reader with reels, a tape which is paid out from a supply reel and taken up on a take up reel is held in taut condition by means of a supply side and a take up side tension arm, each energized by a spring, and the rotating speeds and directions of reel motors for driving the reels in accordance with the positions of the tension arms are controlled so that during readout of the tape the both tension arms may lie substantially centrally of their range of movement. For example, When the tension arm lies at its outermost posi tion, the reel motor is drive in the forward direction at the highest speed, whereas when the tension arm lies at its innermost position, the reel motor is driven in the reverse direction at the highest speed, and when the tension arm lies at the center of the range of movement, the reel motor is stopped. By the way, when the tape is broken during its readout, or when no tape is mounted on the tape reader, each tension arm is held at the outermost position by the action of the spring, resulting in the reel motor continuing to rotate in the forward direction at the highest speed. That is, the conventional tape reader with reels has been very dangeous since the reel motors keep rotating at the highest speed in the case of no tape being mounted on the tape reader. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention is intended to automatically stop the reel motors when a tape is broken or completely taken up on the take up reel between reels during reading the tape. Fig. 1 is a diagram illustraing the arrangement of the present invention. A supply side tension arm 3 and a take up side tension arm 4 energized by springs 5 and 6, respectively, stretch in taut condition a tape 13 which is paid out of a supply reel 1 and taken up on a take up reel 2.A supply side position sensor 11 and a take up side position sensor 12 detect the positions of the tension arms 3 and 4 and provide the results of detection to control means 100.A supply side outermost position sensor 101 and a take up side outermost position sensor 102 detect whether the position of the tension arms 3 and 4 are the outermost or not.A detector circuit 103 detects, based on the results of detection by the supply side outermost position sensor 101 and the take up side outermost position sensor 102, whether the tape 13 is being stretched or not. The control means 100 controls, based on the results of detection by the position sensors 11 and 12, supply side and take up side motor drive circuits 9 and 10 which drive supply side and take up side reel motors 7 and 8, respectively, and when it is detected by the detector circuit 103 that no tape is being stretched by the tension arms, the control means controls the supply side and take up side motor drive circuits 9 and 10 to stop the supply side and take up side reel motors 7 and 8.Accordingly, the present invention eliminates the posiibility of the reels continuing high speed rotation in the case of no tape being stretched, and hence it enhances the safety of operation. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a diagram illustrating the arrangement of the present invention Fig. 2 is a diagram illustrating an embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 3 is a flowchart showing the contents of process by a microcomputer 30. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the present invention. Reference numeral 1 indicates a supply reel, 2 a take up reel, 3 a supply side tension arm, 4 a take up side tension arm, 5 and 6 springs, 7 and 8 reel motors, 9 and 10 motor drive circuits, and 11 and 12 position sensors for detecting the positions of the supply side and take up side tension arms 3 and 4, respectively, which are each formed by, for example, a potentiometer or the like which outputs a voltage corresponding to the positon of the tension arm.Reference numeral 13 denotes a paper tape, 14 and 15 switches which make their output signals a and b is when the tension arms 3 and 4 lie at their outermost position, respectively, 17 to 22 guide rollers, 23 a light emitting device, 24 a photo detector, 25 a brake shoe, 26 a brake magnet, 27 a capstan roller, 28 a pinch roller, 29 a feed magnet, 30 a microcomputer, 31 a memory, 32 a keyboard, 33 a data input unit and 34 adataoutput unit. Further, reference numeral 35 a detector circuit for detecting whether the tape 13 is being stretched by the tension arms or hot, and it is made up of AND gates Al to A4, an OR gate OR, flipflops F1 and F2, an inverter IN and monostable multi vibrators M1 and M2.Fig. 3 is a flowchart showing the contents of process by the microcomputer 30, and the operation of the illustrated embodiment will hereinafter be described with reference to Fig. 3. When no tape is being mounted on the tape reader, the operator turns ON a release button not shown mounted on the keyboard 32, and when a tape is being mounted on the tape reader, he turns OFF the release button. The microcomputer 30 decides whether the release button is in the ON state or not step S1 , and where the result of decision is YES, that is, where no tape is being mounted, it applies a control signal to the data output unit 34, making its output signal d a 1 step S2 .As a result of this, brake magnet drive circuit and a feed magnet drive circuit not shown stop excitation of the brake magnet 26 and the feed magnet 29 and the flip flops F1 and F2 which are being supplied at their reset terminals R with the signal d make their output signals e and f Os . That is to say, when no tape is being mounted on the tape reader, excitation of the brake magnet 26 and the feed magnet 29 is cut off by turning ON the release button, permitting the mounting of a tape on the tape reader. After this, the operator mounts a tape on the tape reader using or not using the reels and then turns OFF the release button. When detecting the turning OFF of the release button step S1 , the microcomputer 30 applies a control signal to the data output unit 34, maing its output d a 0 step 53 . Next, the operator turns ON or OFF a reel button not shown provided on the keyboard 32 depencing upon whether the reels were used or not used for mounting the tape on the tape reader. The microcomputer 30 decides whether the reel button has now been turned ON or OFF step S4 , and when deciding that the reel button is in the ON state, it provides a control signal to the data output unit 34 to make its output signal c a 1 step S5 , whereas when deciding that the reel button in the OFF state, it applies a control signal to the data output unit 34 to make its output c a 0 step S6 .Next, the microcomputer 30 reads the results of detection provided thereto from the position sensors 11 and 12 via the data input unit 33 step S7 and, based on the results of detection, applies control signals g and h via the data output unit 34 to the motor drive circuits 9 and 10 so as to locate the supply side and take up side tension arms 3 and 4 at the center of the range of their movement step S8 .As a result of this, the motor drive circuits 9 and 10 drive the reel motors 7 and 8 so that the supply side and take up side tension arms 3 and 4 are positioned at the center of the range of their movement. Next, the microcomputer 30 decides whether or not a signal i is a 1 which is applied thereto from the detector circuit 35 via the data input unit 33 stepS9 . Incidentally, the detector circuit 35 performs such operations as described below. Before turning ON the reel button, since the signal d is a 1 , the output signals c and f of the flip flops Fl andF2 are both Os and output signals j and k of the AND gatesA3 and A4 are also Os , and consequently, the output signal i of the detector circuit 35 goes to a WO . After turning ON the reel button, if the tape l3 is being held by the supply side and take up side tension arms 3 and 4, the both tension arms 3 and 4 are positioned substantially centrally of the range of their movement by the processes of steps S7 and S8. Accordingly, in the case where the tape 13 is already mounted when the reel button is turned ON, the output signals a and b of the switches 14 and 15 both go to 0s and the output signals e, j and k of the flip flop Fl and the AND gates A3 and A4 all go to Os , resulting in the output signal i of the detector circuit 35 going to a 0 . When the reel button is turned ON without mounting the tape 13, the both tension arms 3 and 4 both lie at their outermost position and the switches 14 and 15 make their output signals a and b is . Accordingly, in the case of turning ON the power source switch without mounting the tape 13, the output signal of the AND gate Al goes to a 1 and the output signal e of the flip flopFl goes to a 1 , in consequence of which the output signal i of the detector circuit 35 goes to a 1 . During readout of the tape 13 the both tension arms. 3 and 4 are positioned substantially at the center of the range of their movement by the processing of steps S7 and S8 and the output signals a and b of the switches 14 and 15 both go to Os , making the output signal i of the detector circuit 35 a 0 . Assuming that the tape 13 is broken during the tape readout and the supply side tension arm 3 is brought to the outermost position under the action of the spring 5, the output signal a of the switch 14 goes to a 1 , by which the monostable multivibrator M1 is triggered, making its outpit signal t a 0 for a fixed period of time t.Accordingly, in the event that the output signal a of the switch 14 remains at the 1 level for longer than the fixed period of time t, the output signal j of the AND gate A3 goes to a 1 n and the output signal i of the detector circuit 35 goes to a Further, the monostable multivibrator M2 also has the same function as the monostable multivibrator Ml, and consequently, also when the output signal b of the switch 15 remains at the 1 level for longer than the fixed period of time t, the output signal i of the detector circuit 35 goes to a 1 . In other words, the detector circuit 35 makes its output signal i a 1 when the reel button is turned ON without mounting the tape 13 and when the tape 13 is broken during the tape readout and the tension arms 3 and 4 each assume the outermost position. When deciding in step S9 that the signal i is at the 1 level the microcomputer 30 supplies the motor drive circuits 9 and 10 with the control signals g and h for deenergizing the reel motors 7 and 8 step S10 , by which the reel motors 7 and 8 are stopped, and the microcomputer 30 completes its processing. When deciding in step S9 that the signal i is at the 0 level, the microcomputer 30 returns to the process of step 87. As described above, the present invention os provided with supply side and take up side outermost position sensors respectively formed by the switches 14 and 15 or the like, for detecting whether the tension arms lie at their outermost position, a detector circuit for detecting, based on the results of detection by the supply side and take up side outermost position sensors, whether a tape is being mounted or not, and control means formed by the microcomputer 30 or the like, for stopping reel motors when it is detected by the detector circuit that no tape is being mounted or streched by the tension arms, With such an arrangement, the present invention permits automatic stopping of the reel motors in the case where no tape is mounted, or stretched by the tension arms, and hence the invention possesses the advantage of less dangerous operation than in the prior art example. While in the above described embodiment it is detected by the switches 14 and 15 whether the supply side and takeup side tension arms 3 and 4 have been brought to their outermost position, it is a matter of course that the above detection may also be effected based on the results of detection by the position sensors 11 and 12.
