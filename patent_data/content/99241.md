# Waste heat recovery system driven alternators and auxiliary drive systems therefor.

## Abstract
An auxiliary drive system for a waste heat recovery system drive alternator having a rotor, comprises a hydraulic drive means 2,5,23,24 for driving the alternator rotor and means 6 for engaging and disengaging the hydraulic drive means and the alternator rotor. The hydraulic drive means and the alternator rotor are engaged for the hydraulic drive means to drive the alternator rotor and disengaged when the alternator rotor speed is marginally above a predetermined speed. The waste heat recovery system driven alternator may be for a ship and has a main drive to the alternator and an auxiliary drive system as defined above.
