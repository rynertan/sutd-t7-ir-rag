# Load bearing wall panels and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A load beaming wall panel and method of manufacture thereof, the panel comprising a non load bearing core and a layer of load bearing fibrous concrete material 33 located on each face, each layer being substantially impervious to moisture, and the thickness of each layer is less than the thickness of the core. A method of forming said panel comprising spreading a layer of fibrous concrete onto a base of a mould, laying blocks of the core material onto the exposed surface of the fibrous concrete and forcing said blocks into intimate contact with said fibrous concrete until it has set, applying a second layer of fibrous concrete between and over the blocks and allowing it to set. The base of the mould may be flexible to take on a curved configuration to form curved panels.
