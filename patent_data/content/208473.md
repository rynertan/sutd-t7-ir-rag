# Stepless speed change device.

## Abstract
A stepless speed change device comprises internally toothed ratchet rings 20,21 arranged in plural rows side by side in an axial direction on an inner circumference of a driv ing rotary member on an input side through one way clutches 19 interposed therebetween, a stationary ring 33 fixed to a frame of a bicycle and encircling the driving rotary member 15 , a plurality of planet rollers 32 rotatably fitted in the driv ing rotary member at plural locations, pawls 22,23 in plural rows to engage ratchets 20a,21a of the internally toothed ratchet rings 20,21 and having bottoms pivotally connected to an eccentric cam 9 whose eccentricity relative to a center shaft 2 is adjustable, and resilient means 34 provided in with the planet rollers to produce the frictional trans mission between the stationary ring 33 and the internally toothed ratchet rings 20,21 respectively and the plant rollers 32 . When the driving rotarymember 15 is being rotated the planet rollers 32 are revolved together with the driving rotary member 15 and at the same time are rotated their axes with the aid of the frictional transmission and the internally toothed ratchet rings 20,21 are rotated by the planet rollers 32 with the aid of the frictional transmission.
