# Hydrocarbon cracking process.

## Abstract
The octane number and or the total yield of gasoline obtained by cracking a hydrocarbon chargestock in the presence of a cracking catalyst comprising an active catalyst component and a matrix, is improved when there is added to the cracking catalyst from 0.01 to 1 weight percent, based on the cracking catalyst, of a shape selective promotor having a silica to alumina mole ratio of above 12 and a constraint index of 1 to 12 as particles thereof.
