# Spray nozzle for a dual purpose shower system.

## Abstract
A spray nozzle for a dual purpose shower system for conditioning felt or wire fabric in a paper making process has two operative conditions depending on the selected function of the shower system. In one condition the nozzle provides a high pressure spray and in the other condition it provides a low pressure purging flow, the condition being determined by the relative location of an internal plunger 28 with respect to a surrounding tubular body 10 having a valve member 26 at one end thereof. The plunger 28 is slidable in the body 10 and has a through passage 40 for the flow of liquid through the nozzle, and the clearance between the plunger 28 and the valve member 26 determines whether or not a spray or a purg ing flow is discharged from the nozzle. The supply of liquid into the nozzle is controlled by co operating openings 60, 20 and ports 62, 64 in the tubular body 10 and the plunger 28 respectively. These are arranged so that when the plunger 28 is in the spray position a greater area is open for the intake of liquid than when the plunger 28 is in the purging position. A spring 54 moves the plunger 28 into the purge position and liquid pressure acting on the plunger 2 moves it to the spray position.
