# DEVICE FOR CLAMPING WORKPIECES

## Abstract
A device for supporting a workpiece 5 from a bench 4 in any required spatial position comprises two G clamps 1 which are adjustably fixed to a metal tube 2 by clamping devices 3. Each of the devices 3 is operated by a single clamping screw having a handle 21 and when the clamping screw has been released, the device 3 can slide along, and turn about the axis of, the tube 2. Also, the clamp 1 can turn relative to the clamping device 3 about the axis of the clamping screw and about the axis of a pin 24 which is perpendicular to the axis of the clamping screw. This enables the workpiece 5 to be set in almost any desired position and orientation relative to the bench 4 and, when set, to be locked in its set position by tightening the two clamping screws by means of their handles 21. The device is therefore extremely versatile and it can, of course, alternatively be used to hold two workpieces in position relative to each other, for example while glued joints set.
