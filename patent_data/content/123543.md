## Description
LEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTS, THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM This invention is concerned with antagonists of the slow reacting substance of anaiphylaxis SRS A and its major components, viz. the leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4 as well as of leukotriene B4. It is known that certain substances play an important role in inducing an allergic reaction, such as asthma, allergic bronchitis or allergic rhinitis, in man. Examples of such substances are SRS A and its major components, the leukotrienes. See P. Borgeat and P. Sirois, J. Med. Chem., 24, 121 1982 and P. J. Piper, Ann, Rpts. Med. Chem., 15 69 1980 . SRS A and the leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4, affect the smaller peripheral airways of the larger central passages such as the trachea and the bronchi. In the presence of an allergic trigger such as pollen or dust, these leukotrienes are manufactured from fatty substances trapped in the membrane of a triggered cell. A series of reactions within the cell generates this mixture of leukotrienes which may then pass through the cell membrane into the bloodstream. Once in the blood, these leukotrienes constrict air passages producing breathlessness. Leukotriene B4, which is not part of SRS A, is an important chemotactic factor which induces migration of polymorphic cells and thus contributes to both inflammatory and allergic diseases. This invention provides novel compounds of the Formula I EMI2.1 and compounds that are pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The various substituents are as defined below. Compounds of the present invention are used as antagonists to prevent or reverse the actions of leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4, and SRS A and also leukotriene B4, and the present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and a pharmaceutical excipient such as a diluent, carrier or coating. By administering in effective amount of a compound of the invention, preferably in such a composition to a human subject, it is possible to prevent the synthesis and or release of SRS A or the leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4, as well as of leukotriene B4. Because of their activity as leukotriene antagonists, the compounds of the present invention are useful in preventing and treating allergic conditions, such as chronic bronchitis, allergic rhinitis and asthma skin diseases, such as psoriasis and atopic eczema inflamation and cardiovascular disorders such as angina. In the following definitions of the variables in Formula I and II, each lower case letter represents an integer or possibly 0 within the range stated, all values of variable radicals apply both when taken as part of another radical and when taken independently and when a given variable appears more than once, the values of it can be the same or different.Where values of variable radicals in Formula II differ from those in FormulaI, the values of variable radicals containing such radicals differ correspondingly.

The compounds are particularly valuable in the prevention and treatment of allergic bronchial asthma. A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. can be administered to a human subject either alone. or preferably. in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice. A compound can be administered orally or parenterally. Parenteral administration includes intravenous. intramuscular. intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and topical administration. and also administration by inhalation and insufflation. For oral use of an leukotriene antagonist of this invention, the compound can be administered, for example. in the form of tablets or capsules, or as an aqueous solution or suspension. In the case of tablets for oral use. carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. and lubricating agents. such as magnesium stearate. are commonly added. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and dried corn starch.When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use.the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and or flavoring agents can be added. For intramuscular. intraperitoneal. subcutaneous and intravenous use, sterile solutions of the active ingredient are usually prepared. and the pH of the solutions should be suitably adjusted and buffered.For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. For administration by inhalation or insufflation, it is convenient to prepare an aqueous or partially aqueous solution of a compound of Formula I or salt thereof. and then this solution is administered in form of an aerosol. When a compound of Formula I or salt thereof is used as an leukotriene antagonist in a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician. Moreover, the dosage will vary according to the age. weight and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient s symptoms. However. in most instances, and effective daily dosage will be in the range from about 0.1 to about 40 mg per kg, and preferaby 0.2 to 20 mg per kg, most preferably 1 to 10 mg per kg in a single or divided doses.
