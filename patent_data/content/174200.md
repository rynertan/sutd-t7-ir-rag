# Sheet dispensing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for dispensing sheets 2 from a store 1 is described. Single sheets are withdrawn from the store 1 by a friction feed roller 3 driven by a motor 5 . Each sheet is fed to a transport path 17 defined by a pair of conveyors 15 driven by a motor 5 . The motor 5 is reversible so that the sheets can be fed either to an output station 19 or a reject position 20 . The motor 5 is stopped as soon as the leading edge of a sheet has reached the transport path 17 so that no further sheets can be withdrawn from the store 1 until the sheet has been dispensed. A conventional doubles detect system deter mines whether a single sheet has been correctly withdrawn from the store 1 .
