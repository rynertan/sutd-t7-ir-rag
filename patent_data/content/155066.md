# Hard diamond sintered body.

## Abstract
Synthetic diamond powders, containing a diamond syn thesizing catalyst consisting of the ion group VIII of the periodic table or Cr, Mn or Ta or alloys containing them used in the synthesis of diamond in an amount of 0.01 to 10 by weight, are exposed to a high temperature under conditions wherein diamond is unstable, to graphitize all or part thereof and then the resulting materials are placed in a reaction vessel consisting of at least one of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W and the like and sintered at a superhigh pressure of 50 Kbar or more and high temperature of 1,400 C or more, under conditions wherein diamond is stable, to obtain a sintered diamond body.
