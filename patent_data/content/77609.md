# Articulated joint for an industrial robot.

## Abstract
A joint device has each of its arms 43 , 44 , 45 jointed at joint sections 74a , 74b arranged at front and back ends thereof. The arms are allowed at the joint section to move relatively in two directions perpendicular to each other. Semi circular guide members 50a , 50b , 51b , 51c are rotatably attached to support member 43a , 44a , 45a of each of arm by pins 72a , 72b , 73b , 73c at each of the joint sections. The guide members of adjacent arms are fixed with their rotation axes directed substantially perpendicular to each other. A driving means 52a, 53a, 55a, 56a , 52b, 53b, 55b, 56b , 58b, 59b, 60b, 61b , 58c, 59c, 60C, 61c for driving one of these guide members around the rotation axis of the other is arranged to the support member of an arm adjacent to the arm to which said guide member is attached. When the guide member is driven by means of said driving means, the support member on which the driving means is arranged is rotated relative to the guide member. As the result, the whole of said arm is rotated.
