# CABLE JOINTS AND TERMINATIONS

## Abstract
Bifurcated and trifurcated joints Y joints and H joints be tween shielded, medium voltage electrical cables comprising a main cable and one or two branch cables can be formed by con necting the conductors of the cables, positioning one of the main cable and one of the branch cables in relatively close par allel relationship, applying stress control material over the semiconductive shield of the cables to encompass the cut back edge of the semiconductive shield and the adjacent insulation layer of each of the cables and between the shields of the paral lel cables, enclosing the joint in a protective sleeve comprising an inner insulating layer and an outer conductive layer, and electrically connecting the outer conductive layer to each of the shields of the cables. An outer protective jacket enclosing the entire joint can be applied. Terminations of adjacent parallel electrical cables can be similarly formed.
