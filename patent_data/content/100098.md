# DC DC converter for remote power feeding.

## Abstract
A floating type DC DC converter for remote power feed ing is connected via a power separating filter to a signal line on which an AC signal is superimposed on DC power. The DC power separated by the power separating filter is stored in an input capacitor 37 and is supplied by a switching operation of a switching element 25 to the primary winding 27 of a trans former 26 and AC power induced in its secondary winding 28 is supplied to an output capacitor 35 after being rectified by a rectifying element 34 . An electrostatic shield layer 46 is interposed between the primary and secondary windings 27, 25 of the transformer 26 and is connected to the capacitor 37 connected to one of the primary and secondary windings. Rectifying element 34 or switching element connecting means is provided by which an AC voltage induced in the wind ing portion on one side of the center winding point of the other of the primary and secondary windings and an AC voltage in duced in the winding portion on the other side of the center winding point of said other winding are made substantially symmetrical with respect to the center winding point, opposite in polarity and substantially equal in amplitude to each other.
