# A SPREADER

## Abstract
A spreader suitable for distributing fertilizer, for exam ple, has fastening members 38, 39 by which the spreader is hitched to a tractor. The fastening members 38, 39 are displaceable, but are retained in their normal positions, in which the spreader is horizontal, by spring loaded detents 61, 85 . To tilt the spreader to achieve a narrower spreading width on one side, the speader is lowered to the ground to relieve the fastening members 38, 39 of the weight of the spreader, the appropriate detent 61, 85 is moved out of engagement with its fastening member 38, 39 , and the spreader is raised. The released fastening member 38, 39 can pivot upwardly until it meets a stop 82, 88 , with the result that the spreader is lifted in a tilted disposition. To return to the normal horizontal position, the spreader is lowered again, which causes a control member 81 to engage the lifting arm 40, 41 connected to the released fastening member 38, 39 . The control member 81 causes the fastening member 38, 39 to be returned to its original position, where it is automatically engaged by the detent 61, 85 .
