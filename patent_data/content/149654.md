## Description
The invention relates to methods for medicinal diagnosis and to substances for obtaining such diagnoses. More specifically, the substances are visualization polymers of molecules such as proteins, enzymes, and chemically tagged polyols, polyolefins, carbohydrates and natural or synthetic polypeptides, which can be combined with biological material and provide substantial chemical amplification of the quantity of material detected. The requirements for a medical diagnostic method, which detects and or quantifies the presence of biological material, include identification of extremely small quantities and selection of a single species of material from a complex mixture containing similar species. In the past, such methods as radiolabeling, radiobioassay and immunoassay techniques have formed the basis for such diagnostic medicine. For example, immunological reagents have been used extensively for detecting and or quantitating a broad spectrum of molecular species such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, steroids, nucleic acids, drugs, carcinogens, antibiotics, inorganic salts etc. Indeed, polyvalent and monoclonal antibodies are very important diagnostic tools in most areas of clinical medicine today. During the past 40 years, a variety of procedures have been developed to visualize specific antigen antibody interactions fluorimetrically or colorimetrically. Since the utility of immunodiagnostic procedures often depends upon the sensitivity and the specificity with which the target antigen or molecule can be detected, new methods for increasing these detection parameters are highly desirable. The scientific and patent literature is replete with work designed with this goal in mind. A detailed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of immunologic methods can be found in any standard textbook on immunocytochemistry see for example, L. A. Sternberger, Immunohistochemistry , 2nd Ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1979. Immunologic detection methods can utilize direct or indirect visualization techniques for measurement of the formed immune complex. In general, these methods visually indicate the presence of the complex through use of an entity coupled to the complex which produces a detectable, quantifiable signal such as color, fluorescence, radioactivity, enzymatic action and the like. The more signal intensity present per complex, the better will be the sensitivity for the presence of a minute quantity of target molecule. Of these methods, the simplest and least sensitive is direct immunofluorescence. In this method, a primary antibody or specific ligand binding protein is chemically linked to a fluorochrome, such as rhodamine or fluorescein which functions as the signal entity. Indirect immunofluorescence methods, in which a primary antibody is used unmodified and it, in turn, is detected with a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody, generally will increase the detection sensitivity about two to four fold over direct methods. An additional three to five fold enhancement in sensitivity has been reported using a haptene antibody sandwich technique see Cammisuli, Nakane and associates see Nakane, The enzymatic signal of this method may occur in either of two ways. Enzymatic conversion of a soluble enzyme substrate into an These enzyme based detection methods are generally more sensitive than direct or indirect immunofluorescence methods since the high turnover of substrate by the enzyme continuously accumulates a measurable product over long periods of time. To further increase the sensitivity of immunoenzyme assays, Sternberger see Sternberger, During the past few years it has been shown that the specific and tenacious interaction between biotin, a small water soluble vitamin, and avidin, a 68,000 dalton glycoprotein from egg white, can be exploited to develop antigen or ligand detection systems, see Bayer and Wilchek in Voller, In 1981 Hsu see Hsu, The limit of sensitivity for the ABC method, however, appears to be 30 to 100 pg of a target molecule such as a protein or nucleic acid. This is significantly higher than the upper limit required for detection of a single molecule per cell. Limits for other less sensitive methods are even higher. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to develop visualization methods which substantially improve sensitivity over that provided by known visualization techniques. Yet another object is development of a stable, easily manipulated visualization system which has a long shelf life. Finally, as with any diagnostic technology, an ultimate goal would be development of a capacity for detecting a single molecule of a species in any given cell. These and other objects are achieved by the invention which is directed to a method for visualizing the presence of an inorganic or organic target molecule, a visualization polymer and a detection visualization complex used in this method and a detection kit for accomplishing practice of the method. According to the invention, the presence of a target molecule may be visualized by combining it with a visualization polymer of multiple units of a visualization monomer covalently linked together by polymerization as a coupling agent. The target polymer combination is accomplished through the intermediacy of a detecting agent which is selective for the target molecule and carries the visualization polymer. The visualization polymer provides substantial chemical amplification of the quantity of target molecule detected. Each unit of the polymer possesses at least one visualization site and the units are linked in a manner which preserves the intrinsic activity of the visualization sites of the units. A unit is a visualization monomer which can generate or produce color, fluorescence, luminescence, localization of radioactivity or localization of electron dense material. The units may be selected from an enzyme or a tagged natural or synthetic polypeptide, a tagged polyol, a tagged polyolefin, or a tagged carbohydrate. The units are directly linked by polymerization or indirectly linked by a coupling agent. Direct polymerization or agent coupling bonds chemical groups or monomer backbone moieties of adjacent units. The chemical groups or backbone moieties utilized for each unit of polymer will be independently selected from an amine group, an oxidized form of a 1,2 diol group, a carboxy group, a mercaptan group, a hydroxy group or a carbon hydrogen bond. Preservation of monomer unit visualization site activity is obtained by forming polymerization bonds or linking chemical groups or backbone moieties of the units which are at least one atom away from the visualization site. This may be determined by preparing a visualization polymer with each type of coupling agent or with each type of direct polymerization process and testing to determine whether additive activity has been produced. Alternatively, if the overall chemical structure of the visualization site can be determined, monomer moieties which do not form part of this structure may be linked by the coupling agent or polymerization process. For instance, if the site is analyzed and found to contain glycine, serine and histidine but not lysine or a sugar, lysine or a sugar may be used as the chemical group for linking. The visualization sites of the monomers can be sites of biological activity. For example, sites for enzymatic action will provide visualization when reacted with an appropriate substrate. In this manner, the visualization sites can be utilized to generate soluble or insoluble bodies of color, fluorescence, luminescence, radioactivity or high electron density which can be measured and correlated with the quantity of target molecules detected. The sites may also be created chemically. Combining a natural or synthetic polypeptide, polyol, polyolefin or carbohydrate with a visualization tag selected from a fluorescent chemical group, a dye, a radioactive group, a photon emitter a luminescent group or an electron dense moiety will produce monomer units which can be visualized. The tag may be present at an equivalent ratio relative to each unit. It is preferred, however, to have a multiple number of tags per unit. The units of the visualization polymer are joined together by direct polymerization process bonding or by coupling agent linking. Direct polymerization produces interbonding of available chemical groups or backbone moieties in adjacent units. For example, oxidative enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase can be used to polymerize monomer units by oxidative cross linking. Alternatively, a coupling agent, derived from a bifunctional or multifunctional organic cross linking reagent, bonds with the appropriate chemical group or backbone moiety of the units. In this context the term coupling agent denotes the linkage group after bonding and the term cross linking reagent denotes the linkage compound before bonding. The cross linking reagent has generic formula I Reactive groups A, B and E of formula I are independently selected from hydrogen, a carboxylic acid group, an acid halide, an activated ester, a mixed anhydride, an acyl imidazole, an N carbonyloxy imide group, an iminoester, a primary amine, an aldehyde group, an alphahalomethylcarbonyl group, a hydrazine group, an acyl hydrazide group, an azide group or an N maleimide group. At least two of A, B and E are other than hydrogen. R¹ of formula I is an aliphatic group of at least two carbons or an aromatic group of at least six carbons. Choice of the reactive groups of formula I will depend upon the selection of the chemical groups or backbone moieties of the monomer units which are to be linked. Each kind of chemical group or backbone moiety will react with its corresponding appropriate reactive group or groups of formula I. An amine group will react with a carboxylic acid group, an acid halide, an activated ester, a mixed anhydride, an acyl imidazole, an N carbonyloxy imide group, an iminoester, an azide or an aldehyde group. An oxidized 1, 2 diol group a dialdehyde will react with a primary amine, a hydrazine group, an azide or an acyl hydrazide group. A carboxy group will react with a primary amine, a hydrazine group, an azide or an acyl hydrazide group. A mercaptan group will react with an alphahalomethylcarbonyl group or an N maleimide group. An hydroxy group will react with a carboxylic acid group, an acid halide, an activated ester, a mixed anhydride, an acyl imidazole or an N carbonyloxy imide. A carbon hydrogen bond will react with an azide nitrene . According to the method of the invention, there is utilized a detecting agent which is specific for the target molecules. The agent directly or indirectly carries the visualization polymer to the target. The detecting agent may be an antibody, a lectin, a DNA repressor protein, a stereospecific receptor protein, a high affinity enzyme, a sequence specific polynucleotide binding protein, avidin, streptavidin, a hormone or a complementary polynucleotide sequence. The detecting agent may carry the visualization polymer by direct covalent bonding with the polymer, or indirect bonding through an intermediate covalent bonding group. The detecting agent may also carry the polymer through an intermediate ligand binding complex which arrangement may be direct or indirect. In the direct arrangement, the agent acts as a ligand binding compound also and the corresponding ligand is covalently bonded to the visualization polymer. In the indirect arrangement, a first ligand is bound to the agent, a second ligand is bound to the polymer and they are sandwiched with a ligand binding compound such that the first and second ligands function as bridges complexing with the compound. Ligand binding compounds include an antibody, lectin, avidin, streptavidin, a high affinity enzyme, a sequence specific polynucleotide binding protein or a complementary polynucleotide sequence. Ligands will be the appropriate ones forming complexes with each type of compound. They include antigen, specific sugar, biotin, iminobiotin, specific substrate, polynucleotide and complementary polynucleotide respectively. A preferred detecting agent visualization polymer carrying arrangement according to the invention is the indirect arrangement wherein the detecting agent is an antibody, a complementary polynucleotide sequence or is a lectin the ligand binding compound is avidin or streptavidin, and the first and second ligands are independently selected from biotin or iminobiotin, N omega acyl amido biotin or iminobiotin N omega alkenyl amido biotin or iminobiotin wherein the acyl group is 4 to 20 carbons in length or an N omega oligomer amido biotin or iminobiotin wherein the oligomer is a polyol, polyamide or polyvinyl group of 2 to 30 units in length. A preferred ratio of visualization polymer to avidin or strepavidin in any of these ligand complexes is about 3 to 1. In this preferred indirect arrangement, when the detecting agent is a lectin, the target molecule will be a corresponding appropriate sugar. When it is an antibody, the target molecule will be an antigen or haptene which complexes with that antibody. When it is a polynucleotide sequence, the target will be a complementary polynucleotide sequence which hybridizes with the agent. A preferred method according to the invention utilizes the foregoing preferred indirect arrangement. An especially preferred method for detection of target molecules is built upon the foregoing preferred arrangement however, it employs a second bridging component. The complex, i.e., avidin or streptavidin biotin ligand visualization polymer, is used to complex with a biotin labelled second antibody. The second antibody is a general reagent for the first antibody detecting agent which in turn is specific for the target. The first antibody is incubated with the target to form an antigen antibody conjugate. Then the second antibody is incubated with this conjugate. Following the second incubation, the visualization polymer complex is added which binds to the second antibody and provides visualization. Yet another preferred method, according to the invention, also utilizes the preferred indirect complexing ligand arrangement. In this arrangement, the detecting agent is a complementary polynucleotide sequence and the target is the corresponding native polynucleotide sequence which will hybridize with the complementary sequence. The detecting agent and the visualization polymer are labeled with a biotin or iminobiotin group. A complex of avidin or streptavidin biotin ligand visualization polymer is formed. The labelled polynucleotide detecting agent is added to the complex biological mixture containing the native polynucleotide sequence to be detected. Hybridization is allowed to take place, then the complex is added which binds to the hybridized and labelled polynucleotide detecting agent and which provides visualization. Especially preferred carrying arrangements include those of the two foregoing preferred methods. The complexes between the ligand carrying compound and the visualization polymer bonded to the corresponding ligand are also included within the invention. These complexes are described above as part of the carrying arrangement of the invention. Preferred detection methods and preferred visualization polymers include polymers having multiple units of an enzyme or multiple units of a natural or synthetic polypeptide or polyolefin chemically bonded to a tag selected from a fluorescent group, a dye, a luminescent group or an electron dense group. Preferred enzymes include alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase, galactosidase, glucose oxidase, acid phosphatase and luciferase. Preferred polypeptides include polyamides of dicarboxylic acids and diamine, polyamides, oligomers and copolymers of alpha amino acids such as glycine, lysine, aspartic acid, cysteine, ornithine and the like. Polyolefins include polyacylamide, polyacrylic acid, polymaleic acid, poly hydroxyethylacrylic ester and the like. These polypeptides and polyolefins will be tagged with such groups as fluorescein, rhodamine, a diazo dye, colloidal gold, luciferin, radioactive iodine and the like. For the preparation of the visualization polymer, preferred coupling agent chemical group bonding arrangements include The invention is as well directed to a detection kit for analysis of the presence of a target molecule especially in a biological material. The kit includes metered quantities of a mixture of a detection visualization complex or the components thereof as set forth above, which is specific for the target molecule, and a standardized quantity of the same visualization polymer. The kit may be in the form of a colorimetric, fluorescent, luminescent or radioactive indicator in which the test quantities and standards are in aqueous solution and in appropriate containers for colorimetric, fluorescent, luminescent or radioactive analysis. The kit may also be in the form of test papers and standard papers such as nitrocellulose which will permit visualization of the target molecules. The Figures illustrate the results of detection tests conducted according to the invention.

Figure 6A shows the results of a PAP detection technique for detection of protein. Figure 6B shows the results of the poly ABAP technique for detection of protein according to the invention. The visualization polymers and complexes of the present invention detect and chemically amplify the presence of minute quantities of inorganic or organic target molecules which may be found in biological material. Generally, the detection is based upon interaction between the polymer, its complex and the target molecule to be detected. The polymer is carried in a complex carrying arrangement which can bind with specific target molecules and exclude others. Quantitative determination of the target is made by measuring the amount of polymer present in the association formed between the target molecule and carrying arrangement. Signal amplification is provided by the multiple units of the polymer in each association. The monomer units of the polymer are an important feature providing visualization of the target carrying arrangement association. The units can contain visualization tags or can react with a substrate which can be utilized as a means for quantitative measurement. This measurement may be accomplished by production of a readily identifiable substrate product or production of a spectroscopic signal, as well as other, similar types of nondestructive quantitative analytic methods for measurement. Preferably, the visualization will be based upon the production of color, fluorescence, luminescence, radioactivity, high electron density as well as other forms of spectroscopic measurements. When the units are enzymes they can generate products which are capable of producing such spectroscopic measurement. For example, they may catalyze reaction of substrates to produce colored, fluorescent, luminescent, electron dense or radioactive products. Alternatively, the tagged units may be directly utilized as tools for spectroscopic measurement. For example, the natural or synthetic polypeptides, polyols, polyolefins or carbohydrates may be tagged with chemical groups which have coloration, fluorescent, luminescent, electron dense or radioactive properties. These may then be used for spectroscopic measurement. Enzymes and tagged polypeptides, polyols, polyolefins or carbohydrates possessing the foregoing properties are well known as means for spectroscopic quantification. When placed in an an appropriate spectrometer, the enzymatic substrate or tag will cause a spectrographic change which will indicate the quantity of target present. This process is commonly referred to as visualization and the spectral change is termed the signal produced by the visualization group the substrate or tag . The quantity of target to be detected usually will be minute and if the signal from the complex target association were produced on an equivalent basis, it also would be extremely weak. However, the carrying arrangement and its visualization polymers chemically amplify the signal so that minute quantities of target will produce a strong, readily determined signal. Amplification is achieved by the polymer because it comprises multiple units of the visualization monomer. The signal provided by each unit is maintained by the polymer. Consequently, its signal is the sum of the signals of its units. In addition, the carrying arrangement may contain multiple numbers of polymer. Although it is not necessary, this multiple arrangement is preferred since it provides further amplification. The visualization polymer of the invention comprises multiple units of monomer directly bonded together or indirectly linked together by a coupling agent bonded to chemical groups or backbone moieties of the units Each unit also possesses a site or sites which provide the visualization signal. That is, it may be a site for enzymatic action or a site to which a visualization tag or tags are attached. The visualization signal activity of the polymer depends upon production of a signal by each monomer unit. Accordingly, the visualization site or sites should be substantially preserved in its or their original form so that the site activity is not substantially decreased. It follows that chemical modification of the monomer units should be conducted in a manner which does not substantially affect the site or sites. To this end, the direct bonding or coupling agent linkage should join chemical groups or backbone moieties of the units which are at least one atom and preferrably at least 3 to 5 atoms away from the visualization site or sites. Also, the choice of chemical groups or backbone moieties for direct bonding or linking with coupling agent should be limited to those which are not present within the site or which are not necessary for site conformation and three dimensional configuration. This choice will be more important for enzyme proteins than for tagged natural or synthetic polypeptides polyols, polyolefins or carbohydrates however, interference with the production of tag fluorescence, luminescence, coloration, radioactivity or high electron density should also be avoided. Generally, these site preservation requirements may be met in several ways. If the types of biochemical substructures or chemical residues making up the monomer structure are known, then one which is not part of the visualization site may be chosen as the structure containing the reactive chemical groups or backbone moieties for coupling. Usually, however, a semi empiric method will be used for choice of the appropriate reactive chemical groups or backbone moieties. According to the substructure residue method, the chemical construction of the monomer units will be investigated. The monomer backbone substituted groups and functional structures such as sugar groups, lipids, oligomer side chains and the like which are not necessary for visualization site action will be identified. Typically, this would be determined by removal modification or modification of such substructures and study of the activity of the resulting product. Chemical groups or backbone moieties present primarily within these substructures may then be used for direct bonding or indirect linking with the coupling agent. For example, the sugar groups of a glycoprotein which are not necessary for enzymatic activity can be oxidized to dialdehyde groups and reacted with a hydrazine coupling agent to form the visualization polymer. If the chemical sequence of the monomer, such as the amino acid sequence of a protein, can be determined, this may also be utilized to guide direct bonding or indirect linking. Analysis of the sequence for the active site as well as the three dimensional configuration will show which monomer structural subunits are not essential to functioning of the site and or not present within it. The reactive chemical groups or backbone moieties of these subunits may be used for bonding or linking with the coupling agent. For example, if the monomer is a protein and it is found to contain a dipeptide side chain ending with cysteine, the mercaptan group of the cysteine may be cross linked to cysteine of another similar protein by reaction with bis N butylenylmaleimide . According to the semi empiric method, the reactive chemical groups and backbone moieties of the monomer can be determined by appropriate spectrographic and chemical analysis. These include techniques such as NMR, IR, chemical derivatization, electrophoresis, osmometry, amino acid analysis, elemental analysis, mass spectrometry and the like. The groups and moieties identified may include amine groups, mercaptan groups, carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, sugar groups, carbohydrate groups, ester groups, lipid groups, and amide bonds, labile carbon carbon bonds and carbon hydrogen bonds the like. Other measurements such as the relation of derivatization and site activity, relation of pH and site activity and type of site reaction produced in the case of an enzyme will help determine a priority for the functional groups based upon the probability of their presence within the vicinity of the active site. A typical priority will be 1. an epsilon or primary amine group, 2. sugar group, 3. carboxyl group, 4. mercaptan group, 5. hydroxyl group, 6. lipid group. If derivatization of amine groups such as those of lysine residues produces a derivatized product devoid of site activity, then the foregoing priority will change and the amine group will be last. Under usual empiric procedures, several versions of polymer will be prepared using a selection of several of the reactive chemical groups or backbone moieties. The activities of the several versions are then tested and the one selected of which has the highest activity. Typically, the selection of chemical groups or backbone moieties will encompass three or four types which are least likely to affect the activity of the visualization site. Each type of reactive chemical group or backone moiety may eventually be tried if results with the first few are unsatisfactory. Empirie examination of each version of polymer will allow identification of the one with the highest activity. The monomer units having visualization sites which are very sensitive to the chemical group backbone moiety bonding arrangement are enzymes. The catalytic site typically will have a conformation closely fitting the substrate and chemical modification which disturbs the three dimensional configuration of the catalytic site may adversely affect the activity of the polymer. Following the foregoing procedures, enzyme site activity can be preserved. Furthermore, the enzyme catalytic site may be protected during bonding or linking by reversibly binding it with substrate. Tagged natural or synthetic polypeptide, polyol, polyolefin or carbohydrate will have visualization sites which are substantially less sensitive to the chemical group backbone moiety bonding arrangement. The fluorescent group, dye, luminescent group, radioactive group or electron dense group which acts as the tag typically will not be subject to variations in activity when adjacent chemical groups or backbone moieties are directly bonded or indirectly linked with coupling agent. Care must be taken, however, to assure that the direct bonding or coupling agent does not also react or otherwise interfere with the tag to lessen its visualization activity. Moreover, if the tag is to be converted to an active group after the visualization polymer target association is made, then the position of the chemical group or backbone moiety linkage should not interfere with the conversion. Generally, the chemical groups and backbone moieties should be at least one atom away from the visualization site. Enzyme protein monomers will be bonded or linked preferably about 3 to 5 atoms away from the visualization site. The visualization polymer structure is multiple units of monomer either directly interbonded or cross linked by coupling agent. The structural and functional character of the polymer will be similar to that of the monomer units. The number of units per polymer will depend upon the extent of coupling, the stability of the resulting polymer, the reactivity of the chemical groups or backbone moieties relative to the polymer chain length and the position of the groups or moieties along the monomer backbone. Generally, the number of units incorporated into the polymer may vary from as few as two to three to as many as thirty to one hundred per polymer. Higher multiples are also possible provided that the polymer chain length is not of an order which will render the polymer extremely insoluble in aqueous solution or will be extremely susceptible toward mechanical cleavage. The polymer may be linear or it may be branched. There may be single or multiple coupling between two adacent units. Coupling may occur at any point along the unit chain so that adjacent units may lie end to end, or may partially or fully overlap. An a result, the three dimensional structure of the polymer may have all of these features. It may be linear but more typically will be a combination of linear and branching units. Partial overlap will typically occur and multiple coupling will also be present. The accessibility of the chemical groups or backbone moieties will also affect polymer length. If they are buried within the monomer structure, steric inhibition will tend to hinder coupling of a high number of monomer units. This effect may be compensated by use of coupling agents having a chain length greater than about ten carbons in length. In a more usual arrangement, the reactive chemical groups or backbone moieties will be readily accessible and will lie either within the proximate ends of the monomer chain or will lie within an accessible side chain or group which extends away from the inner region of the three dimensional structure of the monomer. This type of group or moiety will be amenable toward coupling of high multiples of monomer units. Typically, direct bonding or any chain length of coupling agent may be employed. However, coupling readily accessible groups or moieties with agents which will hold apart the units of the polymer will sometimes provide advantage. This will allow facile approach of substrate or reactant and will prevent adverse interaction among the units of the polymer. Typically, agents having a carbon chain length of from about 4 to about 20 carbons will be preferred. The coupling agent linking monomer units together generally is derived from a bifunctional or multifunctional organic cross linking reagent of foregoing formula I. In this context, the term coupling agent will indicate the group in its coupled form with a chemical group or backbone moiety. The term cross linking reagent will indicate the chemical form of the agent before it is reacted with a chemical group or backbone moiety. Choice of the coupling agent cross linking reagent will depend upon the choice of the reactive chemical group or backbone moiety to be coupled and the agent chain length which will avoid intraunit interference within the polymer. Scheme I illustrates the general plan for reagent and chemical group or backbone moiety reaction. In each of reactions 1 6 of Scheme 1, the bi or multifunctional cross linking reagent of formula I is used. The generic formula for this reagent is wherein A, B and E are reactive groups as specified above and R¹ is as specified above. In the reactions, a specific reactive group for A and its reaction with a monomer chemical group or backbone moiety are given. Groups B and E, which are not designated, may be the same, may be chosen from any of the other reactive groups, or one of B and E may be hydrogen. In this manner, the reactions illustrate cross linking reactions with homo bi or multi functional reagents wherein the reactive groups are the same and with hetero bi or multi functional reagents wherein the reactive groups are different. R¹ of formula I usually will be substantially linear and will have little, if any, branching. Preferrably, R¹ is an alkylenyl group of the formula CH₂ Reactions 1A, 1B, and 1C of Scheme I show the coupling of a free amine chemical group. Usually, this wall be an epsilon or primary amine group of an alpha amino acid residue of the protein unit. Examples of amino acids containing an epsilon amino groups include lysine, and arginine. Examples of amino acids with primary amine groups include the twenty alpha amino acids typically found in protein. Amine groups on other kinds of monomers such as amino sugars or aminonucleotides can also be coupled with this reaction. The reagents of formula I1A, which are used to perform reaction 1A, include those known carboxylic acid derivatives which will react with amines to produce amides. Included are acyl halides, mixed anhydrides, activated esters, acyl imidazoles derived from carbonyldimidazole, N oxasuccinimides produced by the dehydration reaction of the corresponding carboxylic acid and an N hydroxysuccinimide with a diimide dehydration reagent, amide formation with dehydrating reagents such as diimides, phosphorus pentoxide in organic solvent, and phosphorus oxychloride. These groups are indicated as X in reaction 1A . Generally, these acid derivatives may be prepared by condensation of the corresponding carboxylic acid and X group reagent. They may be reacted with the amine chemical group according to reaction 1A, using aqueous or polar organic solvent under mild conditions. The methods and use of these reagents are known see for example Reagents For Organic Synthesis , L. Fiezer, M. Fiezer, Vol. 1 8, Wiley Son Cross Linking Reagents 1980 Ed. , Pierce Biochemical Reagent Catalog, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford Ill. and references therein, or Advanced Organic Chemistry J. March, McGraw Hill 1968 . Reaction 1B shows coupling of an iminoester salt reagent of formula I1B with an amine chemical group to produce an amidine coupling agent linkage. This method is also known in the art. The reagent may be generated from the acidic alcoholysis of the corresponding nitrile. The amidine formation reaction may be conducted in aqueous or polar organic solvent under mild conditions. The methods and procedures are known see for example Lockhart, Reaction lC shows condensation of an amine chemical group with an aldehyde reagent of formula I1C to form a bis Schiff base imine . Examples include glutaraldehyde and other tissue fixing reagents. Conditions include use of polar organic solvent and mild temperatures. These methods are known in the art. Reactions 2A, 2B and 2C of Scheme I show the condensation coupling of an aldehyde chemical group with amines and amine derivative reagents to form imine and imine derivative compounds. These reagents and reactions include primary amine reagents of formula I2A which react to form a Schiff base imine , see reaction 2A substituted hydrazine reagents of formula I2B which react to form substituted hydrazones, see reaction 2B and acyl hydrazide reagents of formula I2C which react to form acyl hydrazones, see reaction 2C. The aldehyde functional moiety will be generated, in turn, by oxidative cleavage of any 1,2 diol glycol group within the monomer unit except that oxidative cleavage of glycol groups which would result in cleavage of the monomer unit chain cannot be used. Usually, the glycol group will be found on a side chain attached to the monomer backbone. Examples include carbohydrate and starch groups as well as dihydroxy alkyl, cycloalkyl and acylalkyl groups. Conditions for reaction 2A, 2B and 2C include use of aqueous or polar organic solvents and mild to moderate temperatures. These methods and procedures are well known in the art, see for example Basic Principles Of Organic Chemistry , Roberts and Caserio, W A Benjamin 1965 or Qualitative Organic Analysis, Shriner and Fuson, Wiley Interscience 1966 . Reactions 3A and 3B of Scheme I show the coupling of a mercaptan chemical group with cross linking reagent I3A and I3B to form the polymer linked by sulfide groups. Reaction 3A is condensation of the mercaptan chemical group with alpha halomethylcarbonyl reagent I3A wherein Y is a halogen to form carbonyl methylene sulfide P3A see, for example, Hixon, The mercaptan groups will be found within the monomer unit as part of a cysteine, glutathione, cystine or similar amino acid unit. They may also be present as a derivative of a sugar or lipid group. Conditions for reaction 3A will include aqueous or polar organic solvent, an acid scavanger such as pyridine and mild to moderate temperatures. Conditions for reaction 3B will include aqueous or polar organic solvent, optional mild acid catalyst and mild to moderate temperatures. These methods and procedures are known in the art, see Pierce Biochemical catalog and references therein supra. Reactions 4A and B show the condensation coupling of a carboxylic acid chemical group and an amine or acylhydrazide reagent. Reagent I4A may be coupled with the carboxylic acid group directly through the use of compounds such as diimide or carbonyl diimidazole, see the foregoing description for reaction 1A. It may also be coupled by forming a carboxylic acid derivative such as the mixed anhydride, an activated ester or an acyl halide. Reagent I4B may be coupled with the carboxylic acid group through use of a dehydrating reagent such as a carbodiimide see reaction 1A. Carboxylic acid containing substituents of monomer units would provide the carboxylic acid group directly or may be oxidized to provide it. These include amino acid residues such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid as well as oxidized forms of sugar side chains. Lipids, carbohydrates and olefinic carboxylic acids are also included. These methods are known in the art, see for example Organic Syntheses , Wiley, New York, Coll. Vol l V. Reaction 5 shows esterification of an hydroxy function moiety with an activated carboxylic acid reagent I5. These would include the same reagents as given for formula I1A. In this synthetic method, if there are free, reactive amine groups of the monomer unit, they could first be protected with a removable protecting group such as a Schiff base, i.e., condensation of the amine groups with an aromatic aldehyde such as p methoxybenzaldehyde or benzaldehyde which can be removed with dilute hydrogen chloride in acetone. Other known amine protecting groups may also be used. These include dinitrofluorobenzene, t butoxy groups and organosilanes. After protection, esterfication is conducted using the activated acid reagent. Monomer unit residues which will esterify in this fashion will include amino acid residues of serine, threonine, hydroxylysine, tyrosine, thyroxine, hydroxyproline, and the like. Other residues include carbohydrate, starch, lipid and olefinic residues with hydroxyl substitutions. These include hexoses, pentoses, dextrans, amyloses, glycerols, fatty acid derivatives, methylhydroxymethacrylate, hydroxymethyl acrylate and similar compounds. Conditions for the esterfication include aqueous or polar organic solvent, and mild to moderate temperatures. These methods and procedures are known in the art see, for example, the foregoing treatises on organic synthesis. Reaction 6 shows insertion of a nitrene from azide reagent I6 into a carbon hydrogen bond. This reaction is nonspecific and can take place at any point within the unit. Since the nitrene is short lived, readily accessible carbon hydrogen bonds will be attacked first. This reaction is especially useful for coupling of the tagged natural or synthetic polypeptides polyols, polyolefins and carbohydrates as well as for enzymes having C H bonds which are readily accessible and not involved with site activity. The conditions for reaction include polar organic solvent and irradiation with 300 400 nm light. The methods and procedures for this reaction are known, see for example Bisson, Reaction 7 is the direct bonding polymerization of the monomer units. It may be accomplished by enzymtic oxidative cross linking, photolytic free radical generation and cross linking or free radical initiation with such reagents as persulfite, hydrogen peroxide and triplet oxygen. Table 1 lists the types of groups which may function as X, Y, and X in formulas I1A, I3A and I5 of Scheme 1. These have been described in conjunction with the explanation of each reaction. R is a monomer unit. The bi or multifunctional cross linking reagent of formula I is designated in each of the reactions. One of the reactive groups A of formula I has been specified for each reaction. The other reactive groups B, E of formula I may be chosen from any of the designations indicated for A of reactions 1 7 or one of B, E may be hydrogen. Homo and hetero bi functional and multifunctional reagents are included. R¹ of formula I and formula P of each of the reactions is an aliphatic group of at least 2 carbons or an aromatic group. Preferably, R¹ is an alkylenyl group, CH2 The monomer units may be any enzyme which will react with an appropriate substrate to produce a colored, fluorescent, luminescent, electron dense or radioactive product. Also, the enzyme may react with a colored, fluorescent or luminescent substrate and quench it. The production or quenching of color, fluorescence or luminescence may result from direct enzyme catalysis or the enzyme may produce an intermediate which enters into a chain of reactions to produce or quench color, fluorescence or luminescence. If an electron dense or radioactive substrate is to be used, the enzyme will act to immobilize it. This may be accomplished by rendering the substrate insoluble, chemically reactive toward the enzyme or otherwise generating an immobilizing physical characteristic. With this type of visualization polymer, the quantity of radioactivity immobilized by the enzymatic reaction or an electron microscopy determination of the quantity of electron dense material present will allow analysis of the minute quantity of target. Examples of such enzymes include peroxidase, alkaline or acidic phosphatase, galactosidase, glucose oxidase, NADPase, luciferase, carboxypeptidase and the like. The monomer units may also be natural or synthetic polypeptides, polyols, polyolefins or carbohydrates which are tagged. These may be based upon a polyamide backbone, a polyether backbone, a polyvinyl backbone, or poly sugar backbone. For the polyamide, the amino acid or diamine compound and dicarboxylic acid compound used to make the backbone may be nonfunctional, i.e., composed of a methylene unit chain ending in the appropriate functional groups, or it may be substituted with groups which would provide side chain functionality. Examples would include glycine, alanine, serine, lysine, aspartic acid and the like as amino acids. Examples of diacids and diamines include arylene or alkylene dicarboxylic acid having at least 6 carbons in the arylene group or 1 to 20 carbons in the alkylene group, and arylene or alkylene diamines having at least 6 carbons in the arylene group and 1 to 20 carbons in the alkylene group. Examples will include poly 3 aminopropionic acid , polyglycine poly glycyl lysine , poly N aminohexyl alipic amide , poly N aminobutyl terephthalamide and the like. For the polyethers, epoxides and or oxacyclic compounds with or without hydroxyl substitution can be used as backbone building blocks. Acidic condensation will couple the oxide compounds. Also, the polyols may have a poly vinyl backbone with hydroxylic substitution. These may be formed by vinyl free radical polymerization of alkyl alcohol, butene diol and the like. For the polyvinyls, vinyl compounds with or without chemical group substitution may be used as backbone building blocks. Vinyl free radical polymerization of such compounds as acrylamide, acrylic acid, maleic acid, alkyl sulfide, acrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, alkenyl amine, acrolein, etc. will produce the polyolefin monomers. For the poly sugar , glycosidic linking through hemi ketal condensation of simple sugar building blocks can be used as the carbohydrate backbone formation process. Carbohydrates such as methoxy cellulose, poly glucose starch, dextran, polymaltose, amylose, etc. are examples. The chemical tags include the known, colored, fluorescent, luminescent, radioactive and electron dense probes which will chemically bond with substituents present in a natural or synthetic polypeptides polyols, polyolefins and carbohydrates. These include probes with carboxylic acid derivative substituents, sulfonic acid substituents, imino ester substituents, maleimide substituents, aldehyde substituents, azide substituents and amine substituents which will react with the appropriate functional group of the monomer as outlined in Scheme I and Table 1. The probes will be monofunctional rather than difunctional so that they may react only once with a monomer chemical group or backbone moiety. Examples of color tags include azido indigo dye, and congo red with sulfonyl chloride substitution. Examples of fluorescent tags include fluorescein with an azido or sulfonyl chloride reactive substituent, 3 azido 2,7 naphthalene disulfonate and rhodamine. Examples of radioactive tags include wood reagent methyl p hydroxybenzimidate HCl which can be iodinated, and p iodobenzenesulfonyl chloride. Examples of electron dense tags include collodial gold, colloidal silver, ferritin, metal binding proteins and reactive lead salts. Isolation and purification of the visualization polymer of the invention may be accomplished by known techniques used for polymer isolations. These include dialyzation, lyophilization, chromatography, electrophoresis, centrifugation, precipitation by electrolyte adjustment or solvent lipophilicity and the like. The carrying arrangement of visualization polymer and detecting agent may be direct or indirect. The direct carrying arrangement will have the detecting agent covalently bonded to the visualization polymer by a bifunctional or multifunctional cross linking reagent. Generally, the bonding will follow Scheme I and method given for linking the monomer units of the polymer. These methods are generally known for example see K. Peters, The indirect carrying arrangement may be of two types. In the first, the detecting agent may be multivalent and have an affinity for the visualization polymer as well as the target. For example, it say be accomplished by employing a multivalent antibody which cross reacts with the monomer units of the visualization polymer and by utilizing the appropriate amount of antibody and polymer so that at least one of the affinity sites of the antibody remains open. The visualization polymer may also be bonded to a ligand which complexes with a multivalent detecting agent. This will accomplish the same kind of carrying arrangement. In the second type of indirect carrying arrangement, there will be an intermediate ligand binding compound interspersed between the detecting agent and the visualization polymer. It will display a high affinity for specific ligands and will include an antibody, lectin, avidin, streptavidin, a DNA repressor protein, a high affinity enzyme, a sequence specific polynucleotide binding protein or a complementary polynucleotide sequence. The agent and polymer will be correspondingly labelled with the appropriate ligand. The ligand may be joined to the detecting agent and polymer through a linker similar to a bi or multifunctional cross linking reagent R¹ ABE of Scheme I. Attachment of the linker to the agent and polymer will follow the methods given for the reagent coupling according to Scheme I. Also, the ligand may be substituted for a reactive group of the bi or multifunctional cross linking reagent R¹ ABE of Scheme I. Alternatively, the ligand may be covalently bonded directly to the detecting agent and polymer. That is, the ligand may be bonded to a chemical group of the polymer and detecting agent which may include an amine group, mercaptan group, carboxylic acid group, hydroxy group, aldehyde group or a C H group. The procedures and reagents given according to Scheme I will be used for this purpose and the appropriate reaction will be chosen depending upon the kind of reactive group present on the ligand. Methods for the preparation of the carrying arrangements and complexes of the invention follow the well known procedures given in the foregoing background. Examples include use of ligands such as biotin, iminobiotin, poly nucleotide sequences, enzyme substrates, sugars, haptenes such as 2,4 dinitrophenol, 2,4 dinitrophenylalkylcarboxylic acid having from 1 to 20 carbons in the alkyl group, and carboxylic acid derivatives thereof. Other examples of haptenes include 2,4 dinitrophenylalkylamine having from 1 to 20 carbons in the alkyl, phenylarsenate, inistol and trinetrobenzene. A preferred example of this type of carrying arrangement and complex is based upon use of a complementary strand of polynucleotide as a detecting agent for a specific native polynucleotide sequence. Avidin or streptavidin is used as the ligand binding compound and a functionalized biotin or imino biotin derivative is used as the ligand. Bonding the biotin or imino biotin to the visualization polymer and polynucleotide detecting agent may be accomplished directly or through use of a linker group. These methods are known in the art see Langer et al., The method of the invention utilizing this example can be practiced as follows. An isolated double strand of native polynucleotide to be detected, such as viral DNA, is broken or nicked with a DNAase at random points along each strand. Labelled nucleotide monomers are then translated into the nicks using a polymerase enzyme and the other associated strand as a template. Alternatively, the complementary strands can be directly labelled with biotin label. The labelled complementary pair of polynucleotide strands are then denatured and mixed with a denatured mixture of unknown native polynucleotides, suspected as containing the polynucleotide to be detected. If it is present, hybridization will occur and the labelled double strand may be visualized with the polymer complex. A second preferred example of a complex is derived from the methods given in the Background for PAP or ABC complex methods or according to Langer et al., supra. In this example, avidin or streptavidin is used as the intermediate ligand, an antibody, lectin, or a sequence specific polynucleotide binding protein is used as the detecting agent and a biotin or imino biotin compound is used as the ligand complexing the visualization polymer and detecting agent with avidin or streptavidin. In either of these two preferred examples, the biotin or imino biotin compound may be directly coupled with amine or hydroxy groups of the polymer and agent through the use of amide bond or ester bond forming coupling reagents respectively. These methods follow reactions 1 and 5 of Scheme I. It may also be coupled through a linker group such as that described above. The linker group is similar to the bifunctional cross linking reagent R¹ABE of Scheme I except that one of the two reactive groups will be an amine or acylhydrazide group which is coupled with biotin or iminobiotin. The visualization polymer of the present invention may be used to detect minute quantities of target molecules. These molecules may be found in biological material such as tissue and fluid as well as in artificial or synthetic systems. Examples include blood, lymph, urine, feces, organ tissue such as lung, liver, skin, kidney and the like, microorganisms, plant tissue, cultured cells, hybrid cells, cells with recombinant DNA, synthetic mixtures of polypeptides, immobilized enzyme systems, synthesized DNA and other biological material. The target molecules may constitute any inorganic or organic species which is capable of producing an affinity with a detecting agent. Preferred targets will be found in the foregoing biological material and systems. Examples include proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, phospholipids, fats, nucleotides, nucleosides, nucleoside bases, polynucleotides, polypeptides, cancerogenic agents, drugs, antibiotics, pharmaceutical agents, controlled substances, polymers, silicones, organometallic compounds, heavy metals, metal protein complexes, toxic inorganic salts, and other agents or compounds produced by or having an effect upon a biological organism or material derived therefrom. Generally, the procedures for combination and, incubation of the detecting agents and targets are well known. They follow methods used for affinity and immumodiagnostics assays see for example L.A. Sternbeyer, Immunohisto chemistry cited above. For example, combination of metered amounts of agent and target in buffered aqueous solution followed by incubation at temperatures from ambient to about 37 C for periods such as 5 minutes to 18 hr. will cause conjugation. Addition of the visualization polymer or its complex under similar conditions will then provide visualization. Finally, if the agent is bonded to the visualization polymer, similar techniques can be followed. Use of the visualization polymer for the foregoing detection purposes has advantage since it allows detection of extremely minute quantities of target molecules. It may be employed in medical diagnostic laboratory as an analytical technique for identification of biological products in fluids and tissues which are indicative of a disease state or malcondition. These would include for example, abnormal amounts of growth hormone, the presence of human gonadotropin indicating cancer, detection of viral invasion, quantification of hormone and regulatory enzyme levels. Also, it may be employed to perform normal fluid and tissue chemistry analyses and may be employed in the biochemical research laboratory as a tool for identification of biochemical substances. The visualization polymer may be used in synthetic protein or polynucleotide work to identify synthesized, semi synthetic or native proteins and synthesized, recombinant or native polynucleotides. Applications will be found in the course of preparative or bulk work to produce useful proteins such as insulin, interferon, ACTH, gonadotropin, oxytocin, pituitary hormone, LH, FSH and the like by such techniques as recombinant DNA or hybridomas. The carrying arrangement of detecting agent and visualization polymer complex will be the form for use to perform the foregoing analyses. Since the polymer will provide multiple signals from the carrying arrangement association with the target, chemical amplification will result. In the preferred form of the carrying arrangement wherein a complex of polymer and ligand binding compound is employed, the signal amplification by the polymer will be further increased by multivalent liganding of multiple numbers of polymer to each molecule of detecting agent. Accordingly, in the preferred embodiments employing an antibody or complementary polynucleotide sequence detecting agent, biotin or iminobiotin labels, on the agent and polymer, and an avidin or streptavidin, detection of femtomole 10 ¹⁵ quantitites can be achieved. This will also depend in part upon employing a sensitive monomer unit system and the appropriate carbon chain linker lengths for both the biotin labels and the coupling agent of the polymer. An example would be use of the enzymes alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase coupled as visualization polymer by epsilon amino group bonding with an active diacyl derivative of suberic acid, and use of biotin labels with carbon chain linkers of from 6 to 14 carbon in length. The polymer, complex and carrying arrangement of the invention may be formulated as an integral part of a solid or liquid detection system and kit. Colorimetric, fluorescent, luminescent and radioactive systems may be prepared in this manner. Such systems and kits would include the detecting components, i.e., the polymer, its complex with a ligand, a ligand binding compound, and the detecting agent as well as the appropriate chemicals, reagents and solutions in metered amounts and standardized concentrations also. For example, if enzymatic action with a substrate to produce a colored product is to be the visualization procedure employing the polymer, the system and kit will contain the chemicals, substrate and reagents necessary for performing this analysis. These materials will be present as metered quantities so that the light absorption produced by the colored product may be used in conjunction with a standard Beer s Law mathematical formula to determine the concentration of target detected. Usually, a standard reaction of polymer with substrate will be employed as a control and reference, although standard graphs of absorption relative to concentration may also be utilized. Fluorimetric, lumimetric and radiometric analyses may be performed in a similar fashion. The intensity of fluorescence, luminescence or radioactivity produced by the polymer in the carrying arrangement associated with the target will be measured by the appropriate electronic machine. Necessary reagents and chemicals will also be present. Metered amounts of components will be employed so that the intensity value may be correlated with the quantity of target using a standard Beer s Law mathematical formula. In these systems, a concentration of detecting agent visualization polymer complex will be used in the test solution which is sufficient to associate with all the target to be detected. Preferably, the concentration will provide an excess amount. The target may be grossly separated from other material by sedimentation, by centrifugation, or otherwise separated by such techniques as high pressure liquid chromatography, gel permeation chromatography, electrophoresis, precipitation, thin layer chromatography, paper chromatography or similar techniques. However, this is not necessary for the purposes of this invention. The signal producing reaction will be initiated by forming the target detecting agent conjugate followed by forming the visualization polymer detecting agent associative arrangement and measuring the visualization signal from this arrangement. Comparison of the signal intensity with a standard graph will yield the quantity of target. Other techniques such as conjugate complex exchange, which are known in the field of immunoanalysis, may also be used. With all of the foregoing liquid and solid analysis methods, qualitative detection may also be made. Since this object will be determination of the presence of the target to be detected rather than quantity, standardization need not be used. The qualitative techniques will generally follow the methods for the foregoing quantitative techniques. The invention will now be further illustrated through the aid of examples. All measurements are provided in the metric system unless otherwise noted. Abbreviations and acronyms used in the examples are defined as follows. Bio 4 dUTP, Bio ll dUTP and Bio 16 dUTP analogs of TTP that contain a biotin molecule linked to the C 5 position of the pyrimidine ring through linker arms that are 4,11 and 16 atoms long, respectively. Bio 4 DNA, Bio ll DNA and Bio 16 DNA are DNA probes prepared with Bio 4, Bio 11 or Bio 16 dUTP analogs, respectively. DNA is poly deoxyribonucleic acid . IgG is immunoglobulin G fraction. DSS is disuccinimidyl suberate. BACSE is biotinyl epsilon amino caproic acid N hydroxysuccinimide ester. NMZT buffer is defined at p. 57. poly ABAP Complex is avidin biotinylated alkaline phosphatase polymer complex DAB is 3,3 diaminobenzidene. EAC is ethyl aminocarbazole. The following examples show the synthesis of visualization polymers of intestinal alkaline phosphatase and the construction of avidin or streptavidin enzyme polymer complexes. These polymers provide visualization which is 20 50 fold more sensitive than heretofore known immunologic or affinity reagents. Also described are rapid and sensitive procedures for visualizing biotin labeled DNA probes after hybridization to target sequences immobilized on nitrocellulose filters and methods for detecting protein antigens in tissue sections after application to glass slides. The examples and procedures chosen illustrate application of the invention to detection of a genetic sequence associated with human placental DNA and a peptide hormone associated with malignancy. These are the alpha and beta globin genes in human placental DNA and human chorionic gonadotropin. Analysis of human genes can be used for prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders and analysis of hCGT can be used as an oncofetal marker of cancer. Affinity purified rabbit anti biotin IgG was prepared as described Langer Safer, Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was polymerized by cross linking with disuccinimidyl suberate DSS . The enzyme, commercially supplied as a 10 mg ml solution, was diluted to 1 mg ml in ice cold NMZT buffer 3 M NaCl, 1 mM MgC1₂, 0.1 mM ZnC1₂, 30 nM triethanolamine, pH 7.6 in a silanized glass reaction vessel or a silanized Eppendorf tube. All subsequent reactions were done at 4 C. A 5 mg ml solution of DSS in dimethylformamide was added 10 µl ml of enzyme solution in two equal aliquots 30 60 seconds apart with gentle stirring. This solution, containing an 19 fold molar excess of DSS over enzyme, was stirred for 20 minutes during which time a cloudy precipitate appeared. 10 µl aliquots of cadaverine free base 0.1 mg ml in NMZT buffer were added to the reaction mixture four times at 10 minute intervals. The DSS cadaverine ratio was then made equimolar by adding another 30 microl of cadaverine solution for each ml of reaction. After stirring an additional 10 minutes, 2 µl of undiluted cadaverine free base stock was added and the mixture stirred a further 30 minutes. The resultant clear solution was then dialyzed extensively against NMZT buffer. The polymerization and cadaverine treatments were often repeated a second time, however these additional steps did not appear to increase the polymer size significantly since both lX and 2X polymerized enzyme complexes detect target sequences with about equal sensitivity. Monomeric or polymeric forms of alkaline phosphatase were reacted with a 60 fold molar excess of biotinyl epsilon amino caproic acid N hydroxysuccinimide ester BACSE by adding 10 microl. of a 20 mg ml solution of BACSE in dimethylformamide for each mg of enzyme present in the dialysis bag. After agitating the bag on a rotary shaker at 4 C for 2 hours, the reaction mixture was again extensively dialyzed against NMZT buffer. Sodium azide was added to a final concentration of 0.02 W V and the biotinylated enzymes stored at 4 C until use. The biotinylated enzyme polymer was mixed with a slight excess of avidin to produce complexes capable of direct interaction with biotinylated probes hybridized on filters. The protein mixture that gave an optimal signal to noise ratio was determined empirically by analyzing the ability of various protein mixtures to discriminate between avidin DH and biotinylated goat IgG spotted on nitrocellulose. Protein ratios were adjusted to give a strong reaction with biotinylated IgG but little, if any, signal from the avidin DH spot. The component composition of the poly ABAP complex was further optimized for high sensitivity and specificity against Bio 16 DNA samples spotted on nitrocellulose, using a constant avidin DH concentration and varying amounts of biotinylated enzyme polymer. The optimum protein ratios were established for each new lot of enzyme polymer to ensure maximum specificity and sensitivity. Enzyme complexes were made using avidin DH or streptavidin and complexes made with either biotin binding protein gave similar results. The poly ABAP complex used was synthesized as follows Avidin DH 1.8 mg ml was diluted to a concentration of 7.2 µg ml into AP 7.5 buffer 0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 2 mM MgC1₂, 0.05 V V Triton X 100 . The protein was added to a clean borosilicate glass tube prerinsed with a solution of bovine serum albumin 3 , W V in AP 7.5 buffer. Biotinylated alkaline phosphatase polymer 0.92 mg ml in NMZT buffer was then added to a final concentration of 1.8 µg ml and complex formation allowed to proceed for at least 10 min prior to use. Plasmid pMM984 DNA, either linearized by Xho I digestion or nick translated with Bio 11 or Bio 16 dUTP substrate was serially diluted in 50 mM Tris Cl, pH 7.5, containing 0.3N NaOH and 1.5 mg ml of sheared herring sperm DNA. Appropriate dilutions were neutralized on ice with ice cold 3 N HCl and 5 µl aliquots spotted directly on BA 85 nitrocellulose filter sheets Schleicher and Scheull, Keene, NH on top of Saran wrap. Filters were air dried, baked for 4 hr at 80 C, and cut into strips containing a dilution series ranging from 0 to 128 pg of plasmid DNA per spot. Agarose gels approximately 6 mm thick were prepared on a horizontal electrophoresis apparatus and DNA samples were electrophoresed as described by Alwine, Probes were prepared by nick translation essentially as described by Rigby et al., For this process, reaction mixtures 20 200 µl contained 40 µg ml DNA, 200 units ml DNA polymerase I, 0.005 µg ml DNAase nicking enzyme , 50 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl₂, 50 µg ml BSA, 50 µmoles each dCTP, dGTP, dATP and TTP P L Biochemicals, Inc., Milwaukee, WN or Bio dUTP analogs. Bio 4 dUTP, Bio ll dUTP and Bio 16 dUTP were synthesized by methods according to Langer, The general protocol outlined below was found to be optimal when using biotin labeled hybridization probes. Filters were prehybridized for 2 4 hours at 42 C according to Wahl Dry nitrocellulose filter blots were incubated at 42 C for 15 min in a 3 W V solution of bovine serum albumin BSA in AP 7.5 buffer, air dried, baked at 80 C for 30 60 min, and then rehydrated in the BSA AP 7.5 buffer at 42 C for 20 30 min. Small filter strips were treated in 13 X 100 mm glass tubes while larger sheets were treated in polyethylene trays or heat sealed polypropylene bags. Filters were exposed to enzyme complexes for 5 min at room temperature 2 5 ml of complex were used for each 100 cm² of filter. Filters were rapidly washed 3 times in 250 ml of AP 7.5 and twice in AP 9.5 0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM MgC1₂ . When avidin peroxidase ABC complexes were used 2X NaCl Cit was substituted for AP 7.5 and AP 9.5 buffers. For development with ABAP or poly ABAP complexes, filters were incubated at room temperature for 0.5 to 24 hours in AP 9.5 buffer containing 0.33 mg ml of NBT and 0.17 mg ml of BCIP see Filters were incubated with the substrate solution in sealed polypropylene bags, using 10 15 mls of solution 100 cm² of filter. To reduce nonspecific background, color development should proceed in the dark or subdued light. Single copy mammalian gene sequences generally become visible within 30 minutes, although highly colored hybridization signals require incubation times of several hours. Color development was terminated by washing filters in 10 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5. Developed blots were stored dry or in heat sealed bags containing a small amount of 20 mM Tris HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 9.5. Although the color intensity fades when the nitrocellulose sheet is dried, rewetting with buffer will restore color intensity as long as the filter has been stored without prolonged exposure to strong light. Using the foregoing procedure with a known amount of DNA to be detected, and standard immunological and affinity procedures for visualizing biotin labeled DNA, the comparative sensitivity results were determined. Serial two fold dilutions of target pMM984 plasmid DNA, labeled with Bio 4 dUTP, Bio ll dUTP or Bio 16 dUTP, were mixed with a constant amount of carrier herring sperm DNA 7.5 µg and spotted directly onto nitrocellulose strips. These strips were then incubated with various detector reagents and the sensitivity of each method determined. Results of such experiments are summarized in Table 2. Indirect immunofluorescence, using a hand held UV light source for visualization, was a relatively insensitive procedure with detection limits near 1 ng of target DNA Table 2 lines 1 and 2 . Indirect immunoperoxidase methods, using either DAB or EAC as a substrate, were better Table 2 lines 3 and 4 , but still only 150 200 pg were seen with a Bio ll DNA target. The peroxidase antiperoxidase assay method of Sternberger Sternberger As shown in Table 2, line 11, the intestinal alkaline phosphatase polymer of the invention synthesized according to the foregoing procedure, which retained high levels of enzymatic activity in the complex, is termed poly ABAP. When used in conjunction with a substrate mixture of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl phosphate, this complex detected 1 2 pg of target DNA with enzyme incubations of 3 4 hours. This level of detection is ten to fifteen fold better than the most sensitive of the other methods. Assuming 6 10 pg of DNA per diploid mammalian cell an average gene size of 5 kbp, 12 pg sensitivity would be required for analyzing unique cellular sequences in a 7.5 µg sample of DNA. The poly ABAP complex of the invention detected 1 2 pg of DNA and thus has this capacity. Figure 1 shows typical Dot Blot assay results obtained using ABC, ABAP and poly ABAP enzyme detector complexes in the foregoing DNA detection method and incubating 60 minutes with known quantities of DNA to be detected. Peroxidase ABC reactions lane 1 generally gave higher non specific background on the nitrocellulose filters than ABAP or poly ABAP complexes lanes 2 and 3, respectively , particularly if incubations with peroxidase substrates were longer than 30 60 minutes. However, using the poly ABAP detector, 1 pg of target DNA can be made visible without significant background noise with enzyme incubations of 3 4 hours. Since the NBT BCIP substrate mixture did not exhibit appreciable end product inhibition of the phosphatase activity, the intensity of the signal could be increased further by prolonging the substrate incubation period for up to 24 hours. Having developed an enzyme complex with the capacity to detect pg quantitities of biotin labeled DNA, the optimum conditions for using Bio 11 or Bio 16 DNAs as hybridization probes were then investigated. Two pMM 984 DNA probes, one labeled with ³²P alone and the other labeled with ³²P and biotin nucleotides, and both being probes of identical specific radioactivity, were hybridized at various probe concentrations ranging from 5 to 1000 ng ml. The results at the various probe concentrations are shown in Figure 2, lines 1 6 the strip numbers at the top of each graph are target concentrations. The autoradiograph of the strips hybridized with ³²P labeled DNA showed significant non specific background at all probe concentrations above 25 ng ml Figure 2C 4 days exposure of strip to film . In contrast, the autoradiograph of the strips hybridized with ³²P labeled Bio 16 DNA probe gave virtually no non specific background noise at probe concentrations up to 750 ng ml Figure 2B 4 day exposure of strip to film . This result demonstrated that a good signal to noise ratio could be obtained using very high concentrations of a Bio DNA probe, thus making it possible to markedly reduce the hybridization times required to achieve any desired Cot value. The coloration signal from the ³²P labeled Bio 16 DNA probe visualized with the poly ABAP complex of the invention, which was prepared according to the foregoing procedure, is shown Figure 2A to be more sensitive than the autoradiograph 2B and approximately equal to 2C. This development, however, only required 4.5 hr. to complete. Accordingly, the poly ABAP complex of the invention in this test is faster than known detection methods and has high sensitivity. The ability of the poly ABAP detection system of the invention to visualize sequences in a Southern blot format was first analyzed in a reconstruction experiment. Various amounts of linearized pAT153 plasmid DNA were added to 10 µg samples of sheared carrier DNA and the mixtures electrophoresed on a 1.4 agarose gel. Figure 4A shows these 7 lanes of gel after electrophoresis and gel lane M as a marker which contained 0.6 µg of plasmid DNA stained with ethidium bromide to indicate the location of the desired plasmid bands after electrophoresis. The regions of the 7 lanes of the gel containing the 3.6 kb plasmid bands were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and the filter hybridized with a Bio 16 labeled plasmid probe. To test critically the potential of the system, the hybridization was done under high stringency conditions in 50 formamide to a high Cot, conditions known to give less than maximal results. Nevertheless, after a two hour incubation in the NBT BCIP substrate solution the poly ABAB complex clearly detected bands containing as little as 3.1 pg of plasmid DNA as shown in Figure 4B. The intensity of the signal was also proportional to the amount of target sequence. The ability of the detector system of the invention to detect specific polynucleotide sequences in an unknown mixture was demonstrated by the following procedure. Human placental DNA was digested with Eco RI, or Hind III and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter after electrophoresis in a 1 agarose gel. The DNA was then hybridized for 2 hours with Bio 16 labeled alpha globin or Bio 16 labeled beta globin probes. These probes were complementary for the alpha and beta globin genes DNA in the placental DNA. The alpha globin probe clone JW101 was a cDNA clone that contained only 400 nucleotides of the alpha globin gene sequence the beta globin probe pHB C6 was a 5.2 kb genomic clone. Figure 5 shows the results. Lanes 1 and 3 are ECoR1 digestions, lanes 2 and 4 are Hind III digestions, lanes 1 and 2 are hybridized with probes JW101, lanes 3 and 4 are hybridized with probe pHBC6. Lane 5 contained 750 pg each of lambda phage Hind III and PMM 984 PST1 digests in 10 µg of sheared herring DNA and was hybridized with lambda and pMM 984 probes. Restriction fragments were observed which had sizes in good agreement with the published literature see All lanes were visualized by poly ABAP after several hours of enzyme incubation as shown in Figure 5. The minor 2.5 kb Eco Rl fragment hybridized to the beta globin probe Figure 5, lane 3 is most likely the Eco Rl fragment from the 5 region of the delta globin gene, which cross hybridizes with beta globin probes, see Proteins separated by gel electrophoresis can be transferred to nitrocellulose filter sheets and specific proteins located by specific, labeled antisera coupled with a biotin label detection system prepared according to the method described in Biotinylated goat anti rabbit IgG Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA was serially diluted in a carrier protein solution of 0.5 w v bovine serum albumin Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO in 2X SSC. A series of 8 spots containing between 0.8 and 100 pg of labeled protein, and one spot of carrier biotin free protein solution were placed on filter strips. Filters were then baked at 80 C for 1 hr. to fix the protein to the nitrocellulose strip. Replicate strips were blocked by preincubating in 3 PSA in lX AP7.5 buffer or in 2 BSA in PBS with 0.1 Triton X 100. Blocked strips were dried at 80 C for 45 min., and rehydrated in blocking reagent for 30 min. at 42 C. The amount of biotinylated protein target that could be detected by each of the four avidin biotinylated enzyme complexes was then assayed using the enzyme reactions outlined in Table 3. Enzyme reactions were terminated by washing the filter strips in 10 mM Tris HCl,1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, after 15 or 150 min. of incubation at room temperature. The results of the four assays are as follows. Comparing the peroxidase complexes with phosphatase complexes, it was found that the peroxidase reactions were rapid, and the sensitivities of the two samples of peroxidase complex were quite different. The ABC complex could detect 13 pg in a 15 min. reaction while Detek II visualized 1.6 pg in the same amount of time. Thin is shown by Figure 7A, lanes 1 and 2. This difference may be simply a function of the substrates employed. The phosphatase complexes had similar detection capabilities in a 15 min. reaction, that is 13 pg for ABAP and 3 pg for poly ABAP. See Figure 7, lanes 3 and 4. However, the phosphatase reactions continued to generate more signal in the course or a 2.5 hr reaction while the peroxidase reactions only increased 2 fold at best in this extended reaction, see Figure 7B. In addition, the 2.5 hr Detek II reaction generated heavy background staining of the nitrocellulose and a false positive reaction from the carrier protein spot No. 9 Figure 7B, lane 2 . The detection limits after 2.5 hr were 13 pg ABC Figure 7B lane 1, approximately 3 pg Detek II Figure 7B lane 2 , 3 6 pg ABAP Figure 7A, lane 3 and 0.8 pg poly ABAP Figure 7B, lane 4 . The specific effect of enzyme polymerization on the sensitivity of detection is shown by comparing the Figure 7 results of ABAP and poly ABAP detection systems after either 15 or 150 min. These incubations clearly indicate that there is an 8 to 16 fold increase in signal for the polymeric enzyme complex of the invention Figures 7A and B, lanes 3 and 4 . A comparison study was undertaken to determine the usefulness of biotinylated polymers of alkaline phosphatase in immunocytochemistry. The avidin biotinylated polymers of alkaline phoshatase method poly ABAP was compared to the peroxidase anti peroxidase PAP technique of Sternberger, Sternberger Tissue sections from cancerous organs containing human chorionic gonadotropin were prepared on slides as follows Sections were dewaxed in Xylene twice for 5 min. each, then hydrated to distilled water through graded alcohols. Sections for peroxidase anti peroxidase PAP technique were treated with 1.5 H₂O in P.B.S. for 30 min. to block endogenous peroxidase. Sections for ABAP technique were carried to the next step without treatment. The sections were treated with the following suppressor systems For the PAP technique the sections were treated with 10 Normal Swine Serum in 3 BSA in 0.05 M Tris. HCl buffer ph 7.5 for 20 min. For the polyABAP techniques the sections were treated only with 3 BSA in 0.05M Tris.HCl buffer pH 7.5 for 20 min. The sections were taken mounted on slides. Primary antibody Rabbit anti HCG, Accurate Chem and Scientific Corp was diluted from 1 1000 to 1 1,000,000 in Tris.HCl buffer pH 7.5 and applied to the slides both for 1 hour at room temp. and overnight in a wet chamber at room temperature. The slides were washed three times with Tris.HCl buffer pH 7.5. Secondary Serum was then added. For the PAP technique, a 1 20 dilution of Swine anti Rabbit antiserum Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp. was applied to the tissue section for a half hour at room temperature. For the poly ABAP technique, a 1 400 dilution of biotinylated goat anti rabbit antiserum Vector Laboratories, Inc. diluted in Tris.HCl buffer pH 7.5 was applied for one half hour at room temp. In addition biotin labelled swine anti rabbit antiserum was prepared and applied to the tissue sections in separate runs. Slides were then washed three times in Tris HCl. buffer for 5 min. each. The Detection System was then added. For the PAP system, a 1 50 dilution of rabbit PAP was prepared in Tris HCl buffer and applied to the slides for one hour at room temperature. For the polyABAP system, 20 µl of avidinDH was added to a borosilicate glass test tube containing 2.5 ml of Tris.HCl buffer pH 7.5.2.5 µl of polymerized alkaline phosphatase was added and the mixture allowed 5 min to complex. The complex was then applied to the slides for one hour at room temperature. The slides were washed three times at room temp in Tris HCl Buffer pH 7.5 . The development system was then added. For the PAP technique, slides were developed in diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and H₂O₂. For the polyABAP technique, slides were developed in Napthol AS Phosphate and Fast Red TR Salt diluted in 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer pH 9.5 in 0.1 M NaCl with 50mM MgCl2 for 20 min. at room temp. The slides were mounted and coverslipped and examined by light microscopy. The results are illustrated in Figures 6A and 6B as pictures of the slides. Figure 6A shows the results of the PAP technique at 1 16,000 dilution. Figure 6B shows the results of the polyABAP technique at 1 160,000 dilution. It has been found that with overnight incubations and depending upon the primary antibody, the polyABAP technique of the invention is 4 to 20 times more sensitive than PAP. At short primary antibody incubations of one hour, the technique of the invention is 4 to 6 times more sensitive. The increased sensitivity noted in overnight incubations is related to the ability of the polyABAP technique to increase its sensitivity while the PAP method remains at about the original titer.
