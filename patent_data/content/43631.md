## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A 6 ALKYL VALEROLACTONE The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 6 alkyl valerolac tone. A known process for the preparation of such compounds is described in Japanese Patent Application 49036 678 and comprises reduction of unsaturated ketone acids with, for instance, a Raney Ni Al catalyst in a strongly basic environment, followed by acidification of the reaction mixture obtained with strong acid, for instance sulphuric acid.A large quantity of strong base is required with this known process, which means that after acidification with the strong acid a large quantity of salt of very little value is obtained as byproduct. In addition, the reduction requires a long reaction time, for example 5 hours, and a large quantity of catalyst, for example 90 g per 21 g ketone acid. According to another known process see U.S. Patent Specification 3,278,557 , a keto substituted carboxylic acid ester can be subjected to catalytic hydrogenation in the liquid phase to form the corresponding lactone. This process has the drawback that very long reaction times are required, that elevated pressure and a solvent must be applied and that an expensive step such as filtration is required to upgrade the reaction mixture. The invention now provides a proces for preparation of a 6 alkyl valerolactone without the above objections. The process according to the invention for the preparation of a 6 alkyl valerolactone is characterized in that a ketone ester with formula 1 of the formula page, where R1 represents an alkyl group with 1 4 carbon atoms, R2, R3 and R4 represent, independently of one another, hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 4 carbon atoms and R5 represents a hydrocarbon group with at most 8 carbon atoms, is reacted in the gas phase with hydrogen at a temperature of 150 300 C and in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst and, from the reaction mixture obtained, a 6 alkyl valerolactone is recovered with the general formula 2 of the formula page, where R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the meanings given above. In the process according to the invention, an alcohol is obtained as byproduct with the general formula R5OH, where R5 has the meaning given above. The alcohol formed can be separated from the reac tion mixture by fractional distillation and, if so required, used for the preparation of the ketone ester to be converted according to the invention, for instance by esterifying an alpha beta unsaturated C 3 carboxylic acid with the alcohol and converting the ester obtained with a ketone as described in British Patent Specification 1,389,510. In principle, the corresponding keto acid could be used as starting material instead of the keto ester see Chemical Abstracts,Volume 66, No. 19, pp. 7996 7997, Abstract No. 85509 h . However, the conversion and selectivity are here significantly lower than in the process according to the invention. Alkyl groups with at most 4 carbon atoms are preferably used for the hydrocarbon group R5 of the ester to be converted. Other hydrocarbon groups with at most 8 carbon atoms, for example cyclohexyl and benzyl groups, can also be used, but this yields no advantage. The reaction according to the invention can be performed with known hydrogenation catalysts, for instance catalysts containing a metal or a compound of a metal from Group VIII or the first auxiliary group of the periodic table of elements according to Mendeleev. Nickel and or cobalt containing catalysts are very suitable. The catalysts can be applied on a support material. Examples of suitable support materials are activated carbon, graphite, silicon oxide, aluminium oxide, magnesium oxide and mixtures of these materials. The process according to the invention can be carried out at various temperatures in the range 150 300 OC. The temperature is preferably chosen in the range 170 250 OC because a high conversion and a good yield can then be achieved. For practical realisation of the reaction according to the invention, the methods known per se for gas phase reactions can be considered, for example the method in which the starting product is passed in a gaseous state, if necessary diluted with an inert gas such as nitrogen, together with the hydrogen over the catalyst in the form of a fixed bed. The space velocity can here be varied between, for instance, 0.01 and 2 gram ketone ester per millilitre catalyst material compacted volume per hour. The quantity of hydrogen can also be varied, for example between 1 and 15 mole hydrogen per mole ketone ester to be converted. By cooling the gaseous reaction mixture, a condensate can be obtained, and hydrogen containing gas that can be recycled. From the condensate, the desired product can be recovered, for example by fractional distillation. It is also possible to recover the desired product from the condensate by extraction. The compounds obtained according to the invention can be used for various purposes, for example in the flavour and fragrance industry. The invention is further elucidated in the following examples.Example 1 A gaseous mixture of hydrogen and methyl ester of 4 oxopentanel carboxylic acid is passed for 95 hours from top to bottom through a vertical tubular reactor 18 mm diameter, 400 mm length in which there is a zone of 25 ml compacted volume catalyst. The catalyst zone is bounded on both sides by a zone of 25 ml inert ceramic material. The catalyst applied is platinum on a support of medium porous silica activated by passage of hydrogen for 16 hours at 350 OC, 1 wt. Pt in the form of particles with a diameter of 3 8 mm. The gaseous mixture 6 mole hydrogen per mole methyl ester is obtained by evaporating liquid methyl ester and mixing the vapour with hydrogen. Per ml compacted volume catalyst, 0.2 gram methyl ester is passed through per hour. During the first 70 hours, the temperature of the catalyst is kept, by means of a heating jacket round the reactor, at 200 OC and thereafter at 250 OC. The composition of the reaction mixture obtained is determined several times by passing the reaction mixture obtained for 2 hours, under constant reaction conditions, through two series arranged vessels cooled respectively to 0 OC and 80 OC, and analysing the condensed product thus obtained gas chromatographically. From this analysis, the weight of the quantity of ester passed over in the 2 hour period and the weight of the condensed product recovered in this period, the conversion of the ester and the lactone yield can be calculated. Conversion is understood to mean the quantity of ester converted quantity of ester passed over minus quantity of ester in the condensed product , expressed as a percentage of the quantity of ester passed over. The lactone yield is understood to mean the quantity of lactone in the condensed product expressed as a percentage of the quan tity of lactone that can theoretically be formed from the quantity of ester converted. The table below shows the conversion and yield data, as well as the operating time prior to the gaseous reaction mixture being passed through the cooled vessels for the 2 hour period.TableEMI4.1 tb operating SEP time SEP conversion SEP lactone SEP yield tb in SEP hours SEP in SEP X SEP in SEP Z SEP tb 17.5 SEP 10.9 SEP 90 tb 41.5 SEP 8.7 SEP 91 tb 68.0 SEP 7.8 SEP 90 tb 89.5 SEP 20.4 SEP 47.2 tb Example II In the manner described in Example I, the methyl ester of 4 oxo pentane 1 carboxylic acid is passed for 155 hours over a nickelon silica catalyst 10 wt.
