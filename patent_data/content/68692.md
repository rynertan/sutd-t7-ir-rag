## Description
PHOTODETECTOR DEVICES This invention relates to photodetector devices in which carriers are generated in a material when illuminated by electro magnetic radiation.One use of photo detectors is in infra red thermal imaging systems where the thermal image of a scene is scanned across a detector whose output is used to drive a visual display. The most sensitive detectors presently available are those made of the compound CdXHg1 xlle arid operating at liquid nitrogen temperature 70 K .U.K. Patent Specification No. 1,488,258 describes a CdHgTe C.M.T. detector having the form of an elongate strip of C.M.T. with electrodes at each end to provide an ambipolar carrier drift. Mercury evaporates from the surface of C.M.T.also the surface oxides readily. To prevent this surface deterioration C.N.T. detector surfaces are passivated e.g. by a thick typically 1,0002 layer of anodic oxide. This also has the effect of improving minority carrier lifetime which is desirable. Unfortunately the oxide is accumulating on n te material i.e. attracts majority carriers to the surface, resulting in 2 lowered surface resistance with consequential surface current and heating effects. This increases the thermal load on the detector cooling system. A depleting inverting type of passivating layer could be used on the C.M.T. This would reduce power consumption and heating but would reduce the carrier lifetime to unacceptable levels. Various monolithic devices e.g. detectors plus metal insulator semiconduct r devices have been built using CdHgTe as described in International Electron Devices Meeting, December 1978, I.E.E.E. pp. 495 500 App. Phys. Lett 32 7 1 April 1978, pp 434 6 I.E.E.E. Trans. on Electron Devices, Vol. ED 27No. 5 arch 1980, pp 591 595.According to this invention a photodetector comprises a piece of material sensitive to electromagnetic radiation and electrodes for connecting the detector into a circuit, characterised by a thin, less Ulan 250t thick, layer of a first passivating material next to the detector material, and a second, thicker, layer of a second passivating material over the first layer, one layer being an accumulating layer whilst the other is a depleting layer.The detector may be photoconductive or photovoltaic detector of visible or infra red radiation. The detector material may be the alloy CdCdxHg1 xTe and may be n type or p type. The first passivating layer may be a layer of anodic oxide. The second layer is of opposite type to the first layer and may be of zinc sulfide ins . Alternative detector materials are lead tin telluride, indium antimonidet gallium arsenide, gallium aluminium arsenide, indium arsenide, cadmium telluride, indium phosphide, and alloys of these materials.The passivating layers may be of native oxides and other insulating dielectrics which have the appropriate inversion depletion ac cumulation characteristics. The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a photo conductive detector Figure 2a, b, c show bending of conductIon and valency bands for different types of passivating layers used on detectors shown in Figure 1.As seen in Figure 1 an infra red photo detector comprises a strip 1 of n type CdXHg1 xTe C.EI.l . material with electrodes 2, 3, 4 formed on the surface. Two end electrodes 2, 4 provide a bias via a power supply 5 for the purpose described inU.K. Patent No. 1,488,258. Two adjacent electrodes 3, 4 form a read out pair. The electrodes maybe formed by evaporation of gold or aluminium. A thin anodic oxide layer 6 is formed on the polished surfaces of the C.M.T. 1 to a thickness of about 8Q2. This layer 6 may be formed by connecting the strip 1 as the anode in an electrolyte solution, e.g. potassium hydroxide EOH , borax Na2N4O7.10H2O ethylene glycol solution etc., as described in e.g. U.S. Patent No. 3,977,018. A thick zinc sulphide ins layer 7 is formed on the oxide layer to a depth of about 1,OOOA e.g. by low temperature sputtering, or evaporation.when the strip 1 is illuminated with infra red radiation ambipolar carriers are generated and are swept to the read out electrodes 3, 4 by the bias voltage to provide a measure of the incident infra red radiation as described inU.K. Patent No. 1,488,258, and U.S.A. Patent No. 3,995,159. The effect of the oxide and ZnS layers 6, 7 on the n type C.M.T. strip 1 is explained with reference to Figure 2a, b, c. A thick e.g. greater than about 200i, typically 1,000i, layer of anodic oxide layer is accumulating i.e. it attracts electrons to the insulator C.M.T. interface. This is shown in Figure 2a where the conduction and valency bands bend downwards. Electrons preferentially move to the interface whilst holes move into the bulk of the C.N.T. As a result when bias is applied to the detector, electron flow occurs at the interface with a consequential Joule heating whilst holes enjoy an increased lifetime. This is described in J.Phys.D App.Phys 14 1981 L1 3.Figure 2b shows the band bending that occurs with a thick 1,0002 ZnS layer. This causes a depletion of maJority carriers electrons from the interface and increased concentration of holes. The depletion of electrons reduces the power consumption but reduces the hole lifetime which is undesirable. Double passivating layers have been used before but always with a thick first layer to produce the pasivating effect followed by a different layer to give a greater mechanical and electrical strength. This results in an interface condition accumulation or depletion that is governed only by the first layer, the second layer having no effect,With the present invention, however, the first passivating layer 6 is made sufficiently thin that it affects but not entirely masks the nature of the second layer 7. Thus, for oxide followed by ZnS layers passivation of n type C.M.T., the insulator C.M.T. interface can be varied from inverting to accumulating as the oxide thickness is increased from near zero to about 1002 or more. This means the amount and direction of band bending can be tailored to suit any requirement. For a C.M.T. detector the amount of accumulation needs to be reduced to reduce Joule heating but without decreasing hole lifetime tco much. A suitable compromise is with an 802 thick oxide layer followed by a greater than about 5002 thickZnS layer. This reduces the band bending, Figure 2c, which enables a precise compromise between surface shunt conductance and hole lifetime to be gained, dependent to some extent on the intial methods of surface preparation.In addition to allowing a tailoring of the band bending the thin anodic oxide layer also restricts the drift in device parameters due to defect and impurity motion frequently found in devices with thick anodic layers.
