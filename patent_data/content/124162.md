# TREATMENT OF LOW CONCENTRATION H2S GAS STREAMS IN LIQUID PHASE CLAUS REACTOR

## Abstract
Gas streams containing low concentrations, e.g., under 20 vol. , of H₂S can be treated in a liquid phase Claus reactor under superatmospheric pressure. The use of such higher pressures aids in solubilizing the H₂S and allows for its removal from such streams even though it is present in very dilute form.
