# SPECTROPHOTOMETER

## Abstract
A spectrophotometer is provided with a deuterium lamp 20 which emits a beam 32 comprising radiation of a plurality of frequencies. The beam 32 passes through a filter 34 for selecting the wavelength of the light desired to be incident onto a sample and then onto a beam splitting plate 26 which diverts a relatively small fraction of the beam 28 to a first reference photocell 30 . The remaining portion of the beam 32 is incident directly on a sample tube 54 . The sample tube 54 may be so designed that its transparent walls form a lens focussing the beam 32 on the sample to be tested. The beam 32 then passes through the further wall of the sample tube 54 and is detected by a second testing photocell 42 , the out put of which may be compared to the output of the reference photocell 30 to provide a signal indicative of the relative amplitude of the testing beam. The reference photocell 30 may be used to insure that the intensity of the beam 32 incident on the beam splitter 26 remains constant over time so that values output by the testing photocell 42 may be com parable to measurements taken at a later time, without the use of a reference sample for calibration purposes. The sample cell 54 is constructed so as to allow the use of the instrument in on line applications in high pressure systems.
