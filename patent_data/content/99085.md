# Optical disk.

## Abstract
In an optical disk, a light reflective layer 5 is formed on a transparent substrate 7 , and a groove serving as a tracking guide 4 is formed on the surface of said light reflective layer 5 , continously extending along the circum ference of the optical disk 2 . Pits 6 are formed in a light reflective layer 5 on the bottom surface of the tracking guide 4 . The depth d1 and width 11 of said groove 4 are λ 8 and wO 2, respectively, and those 12 of said pits 6 are λ 4and wO 3, respectively, where λ is the wavelength of a laser beam, and wO is the diameter of a laser beam spot on the optical disk 2 .
