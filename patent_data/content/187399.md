# Method of manufacturing a multilayer printed circuit board in which conductors of different layers are interconnected and multilayer printed circuit board manufactured by this method.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of interconnecting conductors of different layers 2, 4 of a multilayer printed circuit board by forming a depression in the relevant conductor of the outermost layer 4 so that the insulation layer s 3 is deformed and contact is made between the outermost layer 4 and the appropriate conductor s of the next layer or layers 2 . The method can suitably be used in multilayer printed circuits on a substrate and in flexible multilayer printed circuits on an electrically insulating foil. In the latter case a temporary backing surface is required for the depression process. The substrate 1 or the temporary backing surface must be deformable to a sufficient degree.
