## Description
Ethanolamine derivatives, their preparation and use in pharmaceutical compositions The present invention relates to derivatives of ethanolamine which have anti obesity and or anti hyperglycaemic and or anti inflammatory activity, to processes for their production and to their use in pharmaceutical compositions. European Published Application No. 6735 discloses compounds of formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, hydroxyl, hydroxymethyl, methyl, methoxy, amino, formamido, acetamido, methylsulphonamido, nitro, benzyloxy, methylsulphonylmethyl, ureido, trifluoromethyl or p methoxybenzylamino R2 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or hydroxyl R3 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or hydroxyl R4 is a carboxylic acid group or a salt, ester or amide thereof R5 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl, or a carboxylic acid group or a salt, ester or amide thereof R6 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl R7 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl X is oxygen or a bond andY is C16 alkylene or a bond, which possess anti obesity and or hypoglycaemic activity. It has now been discovered that a class of novel ethanolamine derivatives have anti obesity and or anti hyperglycaemic and or anti inflammatory activity.This activity is coupled with low cardiac stimulant activity for particular members of the class. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula I , or a salt thereof EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, halogen or trifluoromethyl,R2 is hydrogen or halogen,R3 is hydrogen or methyl,R4 is hydrogen or methyl, n is 1 or 2X is Y SR5,EMI3.1 R5 is optionally substituted benzyl or C1 12 straight or branched alkyl optionally substituted by carboxy, C1 6 alkoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, mono or di C16 alkylamino carbonyl, hydroxy, C16 alkoxy, benzyloxy, phenoxy, amino, mono or di C1 6 alkylamino, C1 6 alkylthio, benzylthio, or phenylthio provided that, when R5 is alkyl substituted by hydroxy, alkoxy, alkylthio, phenylthio, benzylthio, amino, alkylamino or benzyloxy, such substituents are separated from the sulphur atom by at least two carbon atoms, andY is methylene or a bond. Preferably, R1 is m Cl or m CF3 and R2 is hydrogen. The preferred value of n is 1, and R3 and R4 are preferably simultaneously different. When R5 is alkyl, it is preferably C16 straight or branched chain alkyl. Salts of compounds of formula I are preferably pharmaceutically acceptable and include acid addition salts formed with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, orthophosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, methane sulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, salicylic acid or acetylsalicyclic acid and, when R5 includes a carboxyl group, salts of that group such as alkali metal salts, including sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts, including calcium and magnesium salts, and ammonium salts. Salts of compounds of formula I need not be pharmaceutically acceptable as they are also useful in the preparation of other compounds of formula I and in the separation of stereo isomers of compounds of formula I when the salt ion is also optically active. Compounds of formula I have at least one asymmetric carbon atom, ie the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl and substituted phenyl groups, and, when R3 and R4 are different, the carbon atom bearing R3 and R4 is also asymmetric. The compounds may, therefore, exist in at least two and often four stereoisomeric forms. The present invention encompasses all stereoisomers of the compounds of formula I whether free from other stereoisomers or admixed with other stereoisomers in any proportion and thus includes, for instance, racemic mixtures of enantiomers. Preferably, the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl and substituted phenyl groups has the R configuration. The most potent compounds of formula I are those wherein R3 and R4 are different and both asymmetric carbon atoms are in the R configuration. The absolute configuration of any compound of formula I may be determined by conventional X ray crystallographic techniques. The present invention provides a process for producing a compound of formula I , or a salt thereof, which process comprises reducing an oxo group and or double bond and or cleaving an N benzyl group of a compound of formula it EMI5.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, X and n are as defined in relation to formula I ,R6 is a group R4 as defined in relation to formula I or together with R7 forms a bond,R7 is hydrogen or benzyl or together with R6 or R8 forms a bond,R8 is hydrogen or together with R9 forms an oxo group or together with R7 forms a bond,R9 is hydrogen or together with R8 forms an oxo group,R10 is hydroxyl or together with R11 forms an oxo group, Rll is hydrogen or together with R10 forms an oxo group provided that there is no more than one oxo group represented by any of R8 to Rll and optionally thereafter forming a salt of the compound of formula I so formed and or converting the compound of formula I so formed into a further compound of formula I . Conversion of a compound of formula I into a further compound of formula I may be effected by, for instance, reducing an ester to the corresponding alcohol or forming an amide from an ester, using conventional methods. Where there are two or more reducible moieties in the compound of formula II these may be reduced separately in any order or simultaneously. The aforementioned reductions may be effected by conventional chemical methods or by catalytic methodsSuitably, chemical reduction may be effected with lithium aluminium hydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride. Catalytic hydrogenation may be carried out using catalysts such as palladium on charcoal, or platinum, for instance, as platinum oxide. Preferably reduction of thioethers of formula II is carried out using conventional chemical reagents. Reduction by sodium borohydride is conveniently effected in a lower alkanolic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. The reaction is generally carried out at from 0 200C. Reduction by lithium aluminium hydride is conveniently effected in a dry, ether solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran at ambient or elevated temperatures. Catalytic reduction is conveniently effected in a conventional hydrogenation solvent such as a lower alkanol, for instance ethanol. The hydrogenation is generally carried out under hydrogen gas at about 1 atmosphere pressure and at ambient or elevated temperatures. Reduction of a compound of formula II wherein R7 is benzyl is conveniently effected by catalytic hydrogenation, preferably using palladium on charcoal as catalyst when X is a sulphoxide or sulphone group. Preferred aspects of the process comprise reducing a compound of formula IIA EMI7.1 or reducing a compound of formula IIB EMI7.2 or reducing a compound of formula IIC EMI7.3 or reducing a compound of formula IID EMI8.1 or reducing a compound of formula IIE EMI8.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, X and n are as defined in relation to formula I and R10 and R11 are as defined in relation to formula II . The present invention also provides another process for producing a compound of formula I or a salt thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula III EMI8.3 wherein R3, R4, X and n are as defined in relation to formula I vith a compound of formula IV EMI9.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in relation to formula I , and V is a group capable of reacting with the amine of formula III thus forming a compound of formula I , and optionally thereafter forming a salt of the compound of formula I so formed. Typical examples of compounds of formula IV are compounds of formulae IVA and IVB EMI9.2 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in relation to formula I and Z1 is a leaving group, preferably halogen or tosyloxy. The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula IVA is conveniently effected in a solvent such as a lower alkanol, preferably ethanol. The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula IVB is conveniently conducted in a solvent, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, at elevated temperature, preferably about 5O0C, for about 3 days. The present invention provides a further process for the production of compounds of formula I or salts thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula V EMI10.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in relation to formula I with a compound of formula VI EMI10.2 wherein R3, n and X are as defined in relation to formula I and z2 is a leaving group preferably halogen or tosyloxy. The preparation of compounds of formula V is described in Published European Patent Application No.0 021 636. The reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of formula VI is conveniently effected in a solvent such as dimethyl sulphoxide at an elevated temperature, preferably about 500C for about two or three days. A preferred process for producing compounds of formula I comprises the reduction of a compound of formula IIA , especially using sodium borohydride in methanol at ambient temperatures. The salts of compounds of formula I may be produced by treating the compound of formula I with the appropriate acid, or when the compound is a carboxylic acid by treatment with an appropriate base. Compounds of formula I and salts thereof, produced by the above processes, may be recovered by conventional methods. Compounds of formula II may be produced by reacting a compound of formula III as hereinbefore defined with a compound of formula VII EMI11.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in relation to formula I and Z3 is a group which is capable of reacting with the amine of formula III thus forming a compound of formula II . Typical examples of compounds of formula VII are EMI11.2 or its hydrate or hemi acetal of a lower alkanol EMI12.1 wherein Z4 is a leaving group, preferably bromine EMI12.2 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in relation to formula I . Conventional conditions suitable for use with the particular compound of formula VII may be used for this reaction. Thus the reaction of a compound of formula VIIA with a compound of formula III is conveniently conducted at elevated temperatures under conditions resulting in the removal of the water formed during the reaction. A particularly suitable method is to perform the reaction in a solvent, such as benzene, under reflux and to remove the water azeotropically using a Dean and Stark trap. The reaction of a compound of formula VIIB with a compound of formula III is conveniently conducted in a polar organic solvent such as acetonitrile or butanone, at an elevated temperature, for instance under reflux. The reaction of a compound of formula VIIC with a compound of formula III is conveniently conducted under standard peptide formation reaction conditions. Alternatively a compound of formula II may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIII EMI13.1 wherein R1, R2, R10 and R11 are as defined in relation to formula II and Z5 is a leaving group, preferably halogen or tosyloxy with a compound of formula IX EMI13.2 wherein R3, R4, n, and X are as defined in relation to formula I . A particularly preferred process for producing compounds of formula IID is by reacting a compound of formula V as hereinbefore defined with a compound of the formula X EMI14.1 wherein R3, X and n are as defined in relation to formula I . The reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of formula X is conveniently effected under conditions which result in the removal of water formed during the reaction. A particularly suitable method is to perform the reaction in a solvent, such as benzene, under reflux and to remove the water azeotropically using a Dean and Stark trap. It is often convenient to prepare the compound of formula II and reduce it, in situ, to the desired compound of formula I without isolation of the compound of formula II . Compounds of formula I having a single asymmetric carbon atom may, if desired, be separated into individual enantiomers by conventional means, for example, by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent. Those compounds of formula I having two asymmetric carbon atoms may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means such as by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent. Suitable optically active acids which may be used as resolving agents are described in wTopics inStereochemistry , Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971,Allinger, N.L., and Eliel, W.L. Eds. Alternatively any enantiomer of a compound of formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials of known configuration. By using single enantiomers of a compound of formula III and of a compound of formula VIIC a stereospecific synthesis of a compound of formula II is achieved. This may then be reduced to a compound of formula I without altering the configuration of the two asymmetric carbon atoms. Thus, for example, reaction of a compound of formula III with theR absolute configuration and a compound of formula VIIC with the R absolute configuration would afford a compound of formula II and, on reduction, a compound of formula I with the RR absolute configuration. By reacting a single enantiomer of a compound of formula III with a single enantiomer of a compound of formula IVA or IVB , the direct stereospecific synthesis of a single enantiomer of a compound of formula I is effected. Thus, for example, reaction of a compound of formula III with the R absolute configuration with a compound of formula IVA with theR absolute configuration would afford a compound of formula I with the RR absolute configuration. A compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof hereinafter the drug may be administered as the pure drug, however, it is preferred that the drug be administered as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. As used herein the terms pharmaceutical covrosition and pharmaceutically acceptable embrace co ositions and ingredients for both human and veterinary use. Usually the compositions of the present invention will be adapted for oral administration although compositions for administration by other routes, such as by injection are also envisaged. Particularly suitable compositions for oral administration are unit dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. Other fixed unit dosage forms, such as powders presented in sachets, may also be used. In accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice the carrier may comprise a diluent, filler, disintegrant, wetting agent, lubricant, colourant, flavourant or the like. Typical carriers may, therefore comprise such agents as microcrystalline cellulose, starch, sodium starch glycollate, polyvinylpyrrol idone, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate, sucrose and the like. Most suitably the composition will be provided in unit dose form. Such unit doses will normally comprise 0.1 to 500 mg of the drug, more usually 0.1 to 250 mg and favourably 0.1 to 100 mg. The present invention further provides a method for treating obesity or hyperglycaemia in humans or mammals, which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to obese or hyperglycaemic humans or mammals. In treating hyperglycaemic or obese humans the drug may be taken in doses, such as those described above, one to six times a day in a manner such that the total daily dose for a 70 kg adult will generally be about 0.1 to 3000 mg, and more usually about 1 to 1500 mg. In treating hyperglycaemic or obese animals, especially dogs, the drug may be administered by mouth, usually once or twice a day and at about 0.025 mg kg to 10 mg kg, for example 0.1 mg kg to 2 mg kg. The invention also provides a method for treating inflammation in humans, which comprises topically administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a human in need of such treatment. Conveniently, the drug may be administered as a pharmaceutical composition as hereinbefore defined, and this forms a particular aspect of the present invention. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples and the preparation of intermediates will be illustrated with reference to the Descriptions. As used in the Examples, the term diastereoisomer refers to a racemic pair of enantiomers.

Demonstration of Effectiveness of Compounds i Effect on energy expenditure The effect of the compounds on the energy expenditure of mice was demonstrated by means of the following procedure Female CFLP mice each weighing approximately 24 g, were given food and water ad lib before and during the experiment. The compounds were dissolved in water by addition of one mole of hydrochloric acid per mole of compound and these solutions were administered orally to each of 12 mice. A further 12 mice were dosed orally with water. The mice were placed in boxes through which air was drawn and the oxygen content of the air leaving the boxes was measured. The energy expenditure of the mice was calculated for 21 hours after dosing from the volume of air leaving the boxes and its oxygen content, following the principles described by J.B. de V. Weir, J. Physiol. London 109, 1 9 1949 . The results are expressed as a rate of energy expenditure of the mice dosed with water.
