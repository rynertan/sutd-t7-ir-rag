# IMPROVED MULTILAYERED TEST DEVICE FOR DETECTING ANALYTES IN LIQUID TEST SAMPLES

## Abstract
A foraminous septum, the foramina of which are filled with a thermally sensitive material, is used to form a barrier layer to separate two functional layers of a multilayered test device. At assay temperature, the septum prevents fluid communication between the functional layers. When heated, the thermally sensitive material melts allowing fluid com munication between the functional layers. The barrier layer can be used to control incubation and reaction times in multilayered test devices.
