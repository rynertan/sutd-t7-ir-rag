# Layered composite for applying graphics having areas of both mirror like metal and patterned appearance.

## Abstract
The first face of a plastic film has a mirror like, thin film layer which is selectively etched away to reveal an opaque layer on the second face of the film. When viewed through the plastic film, the opaque layer has a patterned appearance such as engine turn or brushed metal. An adhesive layer covering the opaque layer permits mounting onto a display surface such as a panel of an automobile.
