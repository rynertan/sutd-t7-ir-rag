# Process for preparing a polyolefin polymerization catalyst.

## Abstract
An inexpensive one step process is disclosed for pro ducing the lower hydrates of magnesium dihalide by commi nuting hydrated magnesium dihalide and anhydrous magne sium dihalide. Also the use of such hydrous magnesium dihal ide products in the olefin polymerization catalysts.
