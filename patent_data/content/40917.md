# A static type random access memory.

## Abstract
Memory cells MC1, MC2 are connected to bit lines DB, Provided in parallel with load transistors Q₂, Q₃ respec tively, are transistors Q₁, Q₄. Transistors Q₁, Q₄ are tem porarily turned ON after information has been written into memory cell MC1 or MC2. This effectively reduces bit line load resistance or, seen in another light, provides effec tive bit line load transistors of large conductance gm.
