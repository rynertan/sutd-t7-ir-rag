More particularly, this invention relates to the recovery of mixtures ot benzene, toluene, xylenes BTX and other aromatics up to C16 at the same purity levels required for petrochemical uses Kt with a significant reduction in energy consumption. bACKGROUND With the advent of the benzene toluene Cs aromatics fraction known and hereinafter reterred to at BTX as the principal raw material in the manufacture of petrochemicals, outstripping ethylene in this regard, and the increases demand for aromatics as a component in gasoline, to increase its octane rating ana thus reduce or eliminate the need tor lead, which has teen under rire as a pollutant, aromatics processes availed ot in tne past have come under close scrutiny with an eye toward improving process economics, which can t translated into, among other things, the use of less apparatus ana decreased neat requirements. The recovery of aromatic hydrocarbons ty selective extraction and distillation of hydrocarbon mixtures containing relatively polar compounds aromatic and olerinic groups ana relatively less polar compounds paraffinic and napthenic groups is well known. A wiae variety of techniques can be used. Tne following are typical prior art techniques 1 ln tne recovery of benzene, toluene, and C8 aromatics trom petroleum fractions, tetraethylene glycol is used as tne selective extraction solvent.Tne t3TX is steam distillea trom the solvent which remains as bottoms and is recycled to tne extraction step 2 ln the recovery of benzene, toluene, and C8 aromatics from petroleum tractions, sultolane water mixtures 2 4 percent water t weight are used as the selective extraction solvent. The nonaromatics are separated from the ricn solvent in a stripper at pressures tnat are slightly higher than atmospheric pressure. Tnese nonaromatics are sent Sck to the extraction zone as reflux. ne BTX is separated from tne solvent in a recovery column at a Out 450 mm Hg. The solvent remains as bottoms and is recycled to the extraction step ana 3 Kerosenes can te treated with liquid SO2 and this solvent is then distilled trom tne extracted aromatics. Furtner examples include, Poffenberger s U.S. Patent No. 2,711,433 which aiscioses an improved process for the selective solvent extraction and recovery of aromatic hydrocar ins from mixtures with non aromatic nydrocarbons. The particular method provides for the separation and recovery of individual aromatic hyarocarbons of industrial grade or witter without the need for chemical treatment. This particular patent claims heat economy, however a very complicatea five column extraction distiilation process is usea. Fenske and McCormick in U.S. Patent No.2,909,576 disclose a method tor the separation or benzene from virgin or cracked naptnas with the use or NH3 as tne solvent. The process operates under the theory that azeotropes ot nonaromatic hydrocarbons with NH3 are formed tnat can the separated from aromatic hydrocarbons. Trough this patent claims heat recovery through the use or compressors, the pressures used are excessively high, and therefore require more expensive equipment to handle these higner pressures. Furthermore, the aromatic product obtained has low purity. Uitti and Okuma in U.S. Patent No. 3,367,846 claim a process for the separation of aromatic hyarocarbon mixtures of Knzene, toluene and xylene utilizing rractional distillation. Low pressure columns are used in order to recover heat.The neat of condensation of the top vapors of the xylene column are employed to generate steam whicn is then used to operate the benzene column. This process however, proves usetul only in the separation of aromatics hydrocarbons trom each other. Though these separation techniques are or have been widely used in industry, they demand a great deal of heat for the distillation steps. It is, therefore, very desirable to reduce the heat load costs in such processes. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for the separation of aromatic nyarocarbons rrom petroleum fractions resulting in a signiticant reduction in energy consumption. It is another object of the present invention to provide an improvement to an extraction aistillation process wherein the vapor sidedraw products are compressed and the heat of condensation or the vapor siaedraw products are utilizea to vaporize stripping water thus producing stripping steam, thereby reducing the heat load of tne process.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING The sole FIGURE is a schematic flow diagram of a typical scheme for carrying out the invention.Pumps and other auxiliary equipment, which are obvious to those skilled in the art, needed to practice this invention are not shown. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to this drawing, a gasoline fraction that can come from a broad range of sources such as pyrolysis gasoline, reformate, coke oven light oil, kerosene, or mixtures thereof, is introduced through Conduit 1 to a Heat Exchanger 23 where the feed stream is typically heated to a temperature in the range of 2000 2500F and then is introduced into Extraction Column 22 at abut the midpoint. The feed rlows upward and is contacted t the solvent entering Extractor 22 throughConduit 3. Extraction Column 22 typically operates at a temperature in the range of 2500 350 F. The solvent selectively extracts aromatics. The undissolved aliphatics continue flowing up the column and are removed from the top as the raffinate phase through Conduit 2.The raffinate temperature typically will be 2500 3500F. The part ofExtractor 22 above the feed plate serves as the aromatics recovery section the part below is the purirication section. The raffinate is used to heat the feed in Heat Exchanger 23 before entering the extraction Column 22. The aromatics rich solvent leavesExtractor 22 through Conduit 4 and is let down through Pressure Control Valve 20, to the top otStripper Column 24. Due to the pressure drop taking place in Pressure Control Valve 20, the aromatic rich solvent is partially and adiabatically vaporized in Flash ones 34 ana 35. Tne aromatic rich solvent proceeds into Flash Zone 34 throughConduit 40. Flash Zone 34 operates in the range of 30 50 psia. Tne liquid portion then proceeds through Conduit 19 into Flash Zone 35 where partial vaporization occurs. Flash Zone 35 operates at approximately tne same pressure as Stripper Column 24. A great amount of tur Klence occurs in FlashZones 34 and 35 caused by the flashing of a relatively large amount of rich solvent.Considerable entrainment of the rich solvent liquid in the vapors can take place in these sections and, therefore, a demister pad not snown could te installed in each section to minimize this entrainment. The vapor portions of the flashing sections consist mainly of nydrocar Yns and water they leave Flash Zones 34 and 35 through Conduits 15 and 18, respectively. The liquid portions or the flashing sections, consisting of solvent, water ana hydrocarbons enter the trayed sections of StripperColumn 24 through Downcomer 43 in Flash Zone 35. Stripper Column 24 is operated approximately between atmosphere pressure ana 30 psia, and between 2700F 3500F depenaing upon the particular feeding teing processed. An extractive distillation further aromatics purification occurs in the upper portion of Stripper Column 24. Light overhead distillate leaves tne top of this column through Conduit 17 where it is combined with the vapors in Conduits 15 and 18 in Conduit 16. Conduit 16 flows intoCondenser 28. The resultant condensate is the passed through Conduit 6 to Decanter 27 where it is separated into two liquid layers a hydrocarbon layer and a water layer. The hydrocarbon layer is recycled through Conduit 5 to the bottom ofExtractor 22 as reflux. The reflux stream serves to further purity the rich aromatic solvent stream by back washing or displacing the nonaromatics in the bottom portion of Extractor 22. The water layer is passed through Conduit 8 and One way Flow CheckValve 37 to Conduit 14 which connects with MixingElement 31.One way Flow Check Valve 37 is used to avoid the back flow of water into Pump 36. Vapors consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, water and trace amounts of nonaromatic hydrocarbons impurities are withdrawn as a siae stream product from the middle of Stripper Column 24 throughConduit 7 which connects with Compressor 29. The vapors in Conduit 7 are compressed in Compressor 29 to a pressure at which their condensation temperature will be greater than the boiling point of the liquid water entering Exchanger 30 throughConduit 10. The heat of condensation of the vapors in Conduit 48 can then be used as the source to vaporize the water entering Exchanger 30 througnConduit 10. After this water has been vaporized now steam , it leaves Exchanger 30 through Conduit 47 which connects with the bottom of DistillationColumn 24.This steam is usea at the bottom ofStripper Column 24 to strip out the last traces of hyarocarbons from the lean solvent which leaves this column through Conduit 3. After the vapors in Conduit 48 are condensea in Exchanger 30, they are passed throughConduit 49 to Decanter 32. In this decanter, they are separated into two liquid phases one hyarocrabon phase and one water phase. The hydrocarbon phase which consists of aromatic hydrocarbons, trace amounts of paraffins, naphthenic hyarocarbons plus some solvent and water leaves Decanter 32 through Conduit 50 which then connects with Trim Cooler 33. The stream is cooled in Trim Cooler 33 to about room temperature. The stream is then passed to Conduit 11. The solvent leaving in Aromatic Product 11 can be recovered via other technology. The water pnase leaves Decanter 32 through Conduit 9 which connects with One wayFlow Valve 38 and Mixing Element 31. The purpose ofOne way Flow Valve 38 is to avoid back flow of the liquid water in Mixing Element 31 into Decanter 32.The liquid water in Conduit 10 results from the combination of the water in Conduits 14 and 9 inMixing Element 31. Distillation Column 24 can be operated between 17 psia and 30 psia depending upon the feed type entering Extractor 22. The temperature and pressure at the bottom of this column also determines the concentration of water in the lean solvent tnat leaves this column through Conduit 3.The choice of pressure and temperature will be determined by th type and content or polar compounds present in the feed to Extractor 22. Partial lean solvent taken from Stripper Column 24 flows throughConduit 4i to Reboiler 21 where water and the last traces of aromatic hydrocarbons are vaporized ana reintroduced into the bottom of Stripper Column 24 through Conduit 42. High pressure steam 650 to 1200 psia is introduced through Conduit 44 which connects withTurbine 51. This steam is used to operate Turbine 51 which subsequently drives Compressor 29.Compressor 29 is used to compress the vapors in Conduit 7. The high pressure steam is let down tnough Turbine 51 to a pressure low enough to operate this turbine St high enough so that its heat content is sufficient to use as the heat source to drive Retailer 21. In general, this pressure will be between 150 and 200 psia. As a general rule, more steam will X required to operate Turbine 51 than Re boiler 21, therefore, part of tne steam leaving Turbine 51 is taken through Conduit 46 which connects with Reboiler 21 and is, thus, usea to drive Rye boiler 21. Re boiler 21 in turn, supplies the heat needed to operate Stripper Column 24.The excess steam trom Turbine 51 is taken throughConduit 45 to any other part of the refinery where it can be used. Conduit 13 is used to supply any makeup solvent required because of its loss in the aromatic product Conduit 11 and the raffinate product Conduit 2 . Conduit 12 is used to supply any makeup water required because of its loss in the aromatic product Conduit 11 ana the raffinate product Conduit 2 . Organic compounds suitable as the solvent in this process may be selected from the relatively larye group of compounds characterized generally as oxygen containing compounds, particularly aliphatic and cyclic alcohols, glycols, glycol ethers, and glycol esters. Mono and polyalkylene glycols in which the alkylene group contains from 2 to 4 carbon atoms such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol and tetraethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, and tripropylene glycol, consitute a particular preterred class of organic solvents useful in admixture witn water. Other solvents suitable for use in this invention include sulfolane N methyl pyrrolldone diethanolamine aniline monoethanolamine tutyrolactone 1,4, cyclohexane dimethanol phenol, glycerine dimethylformide furfural formide dimethyl solfoxide malononitrile resorcinol, diacetin aniardine CARBITOL acetamide triacetin xylidine acetanilide nitrobenzene diaminopropanol tricresylphosphate tenzaldehyde trietnanolamine eugenol diphenylamine acetophenone xylenol CARBITOL acetate butylcarbitol phenetidine dibutylphthalate and mixtures thereof. Tne prererred solvents in tne process are diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol or solutions thereof with water.Tetraetnylene glycol is a preferred selective solvent for the present invention. It has very high selectivity, is stable, noncorrosive, and has a very high boiling point. It is important to note tnat these solvents have aensities above 1.1, allowing them to be used to treat petroleum fractions in conventional extraction equipment. Extraction temperatures can range from 2000F to 350OF with 29U F to 3200F being the preferred temperature range. Tne choice depends upon the concentration of polar compounds in the feed, the degree of polarity of the polar compounds, product specifications and the solvent employed. Higher temperatures are needed when the concentrations of. polar compounds in the feed are low the polar compounds are low in polarity, the nonpolar product must be low in polar compounds, ana the solvent contains a low carbon oxygen ratio. The solvent teed ratio can range from 2 1 to 12 1 by weight, 4 1 to 10 1 being preferred, ana 6 1 to 8 1 being most preferred. Conventional extraction apparatus can be used, and this includes columns containing sieve trays, packing or rotating oscillating agitators, and mixer settler type units. The choice depends upon the viscosity ot the feedstock and solvent and the required number of theoretical stages. Staging requirements can vary from 2 to 20 theoretical stages, 3 to 15 being preferred and 4 to 12 being most preferred. Conventional distillation apparatus can be used, and this includes columns containing sieve trays, packing, valve trays, bubble cap trays, ballast trays, etc. The choice depends upon the viscosity teedstock and solvent and the required number of theoretical stages. Staging requirements for the stripper column vary from 4 to 25 theoretical stages, 6 to 20 being preferred ana 8 to 15 teing most preferred.
