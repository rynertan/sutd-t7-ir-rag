## Description
CORROSION RESISTANT SILICON NITRIDE BODIESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for producing corrosion resistant silicon nitride bodies. More particularly, it provides a silicon nitride composition from which corrosion resistant silicon nitride bodies can be produces. In general, silicon nitride by itself has limited usage.In order to produce materials for turbines, cutting tools, wear parts and the like, composites are needed which can be pressed to give bodies with special properties such as corrosion resistance. Presently yttria and alumina are used with silicon nitride to produce bodies of corrosion resistance. This invention involves the use of lanthana and alumina with silicon nitride as a composition which when pressed and sintered produces a body of better corrosion resistance than that which is produced by the yttria alumina silicon nitride powder.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one aspect of this invention there is provided a silicon nitride body consisting essentially of, in percent by weight from about 3 to about 18 lanthanum oxide, from about 0.5 to about 5 aluminum oxide, up to about 2 iron, up to about 0.25 each of carbon, calcium, aluminum or their oxides, and the balance silicon nitride. The body has a relatively high resistance to phosphoric acid corrosion. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects, advantages, and capabilities thereof, reference is made to the following disclosure and appended claims in connection with the foregoing description of some of the aspects of the invention. The silicon nitride composition of this invention consists essentially of silicon nitride and sintering aids such as lanthanum oxide, mixtures of lanthanum oxide and aluminum oxide, lanthanum aluminate and mixtures of lanthanum aluminate with either lanthanum oxide or aluminum oxide or both. The composition of this invention consists essentially in percent by weight from about 3 to about 18 lanthanum oxide, from about 0.5 to about 5 aluminum oxide and the balance silicon nitride. A preferred composition consists essentially of in percent by weight from about 3 to about 15 lanthanum oxide, from about 1 to about 5 aluminum oxide and the balance silicon nitride with a preferred atomic ratio of lanthanum to aluminum of about 1 to 1. Still another preferred composition consists essentially of in percent by weight from about 3 to about 12 lanthanum oxide, from about 0.5 to about 4 aluminum oxide and the balance silicon nitride. A procedure for forming lanthanum aluminate is set forth inU.S. Patent Application SN attorney s docket No. 83 2 119, filed and assigned to the same assignee as this application.That patent application is hereby incorporated by reference. Mixtures of the above sintering aids can be used, for example, lanthanum oxide or aluminum oxide with lanthanum aluminate. The silicon nitride which is used is relatively impure. A typical composition of silicon nitride is as follows of in percent by weight from about .05 to about 0.25 carbon, from about .05 to about 0.25 calcium or calcium oxide, from about .05 to about 0.25 aluminum or aluminum oxide, up to about 2 iron or iron oxide, and the balance silicon nitride.Such a material is currently supplied by Nippon Denko. The admixture of the relatively impure silicon nitride and the other components is formed by any conventional method such as ball milling, blending and the like which will result in a uniform homogeneous mixture. The admixture is then pressed and sintered by conventional methods to form a silicon nitride body. Copending application SN , attorney s docket No.83 2 129 filed discloses a suitable process and is hereby concurrently herewith discloses a suitable process and is hereby incorporated by reference. The resulting silicon nitride body has a relatively high resistance to phosphoric acid corrosion. To more fully illustrate this invention, the following non limiting examples are presented. All parts, portions, and percentages are on a weight basis unless otherwise stated.EXAMPLE Parts of silicon nitride of the following compositions withNippon Denko silicon nitride are weighed, immersed in about 86 phosphoric acid for about seven days and weighed after the immersion period. The degree of corrosion is measured by the weight loss of the parts given below.

While there has been shown and described what are at present considered the preferred embodiments of the invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
