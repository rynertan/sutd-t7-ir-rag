# Method of detecting and quantitating haptens and antigens.

## Abstract
The method comprises contacting a sample containing an unknown quantity of a first immuno reactive substance selected from haptens, antigens and mixtures thereof, to be detected and quantitated, with a a known quantity of a reagent containing a known concentration of an antibody specitic for that first immuno reactive substance, and b a solid phase having a known concentration of a second immuno reactive substance selected from haptens, antigens and mixtures thereof reactible with the antibody to be passively adsorbed to the solid phase. The contacting is effected for a time sufficient to cause the first and second immuno reactive substances to combine competitively with the antibody. The solid phase is then isolated, bearing with it the second immuno reactive substance and the antibody bound thereto. That antibody is then labeled by any suitable means and thereafter the concentration of the labeling bound to the antibody is determined as a measure of the concentration of the antibody bound to the solid phase and as a measure of the first immuno reactive substance initially present in the sample. The sample and the reagent containing the antibody are in the liquid phase and the sample and reagent may either be mixed together and reacted before contacting the solid phase or, alternately, the sample, reagent and solid phase may contact each other simultaneously for the first time. An enzyme or a radioactive material or the like may be used as the labeling agent. The method has improved sensitivity and adaptability does not require the use of dangerous or expensive reagents.

## Description
METHOD OF DETECTING AND QUANTITATING HAPTENS AND ANTIGENS Background of the InventionField of the Invention The present invention generally relates to test methods and more particularly to a method for detecting and quantitatinci haptens and antigens. Prior Art Kaptens are classically measured by the competitive inhibition assay first described by Yalow and Berson J. Clin. Invest. 39 1157, 1960 . This assay is a radicimmunoassay carried out by mixing a limiting amount of hapten specific antibody with specified volumes of a sample containing an unknown amount of a hapten and a solution containing a known amount of the same hapten or an analog of the same hapten. Unlabeled and labeled haptens then compete for a limited number of antibody binding sites.By separating the free and the antibody bound labeled hapten into distinct fractions or phases and then measuring the amount of radioactivity in each of these two phases and then measuring the amount of radioactivity in each of these two phases, one can quantitatively determine the amount of hapten in the sample being tested. Phase separation of the free hapten and the antibody bound hapten can be accomplished by several methods which are currently in practice. including the use of species specific antiglobulin to precipitate hapten antibody comDlexes. Charcoal, ion exchange resins and various other types of solid phases have also been used to bind specific antibody. The general methodologies and principles which are utilized in the radioisotope immunossay methods employing phase separatipn to quantititate haptens have more recently also been applied to systems which employ reagents which are labeled with enzymes instead of radioisotopes. One such system is known as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay t ELISA , utilizing enzymc hapten conjugates and a plastic solid phase to which haptenspecific antibody is adsorbed to effect phase separation. As in the case of radioimmunoassays, sample hapten and enzyme labeled hapten compete for a limited number of antibody combining sites on the solid phase.The amount of antibody bound labeled hapten which has an inverse relationship to the amount of hapten in the unknown sample is determined by measuring the enzymatic activity of the solid phase. A second system known as the enzyme multiplication immunoassay technique EMIT is similar to ELISA and certain radioimmunoassays in that enzyme labeled hapten and sample hapten compete for a limited number of antibody binding sites. HoweverEMIT does not require phase separation because the enzyme hapten conjugate is prepared in such a manner that the enzyme will not react with substrate when antibody is bound to the enzyme hapten conjugate. Consequently, EMIT specifically measures the amount of free or unbound enzyme hapten conjugate. There are few examples of hapten assays in which hapten itself is bound to a solid phase. One such example is the competitive enzyme linked immunoassay CELIA described byYorde et al. Clin. Chem, 22 1372, 1976 . In the CELIA system free hapten in an unknown sample and hapten covalently bound to a solid phase, such as Sepharose beads which are cross linked dextran, compete for a limiting number of antibody lust antibody binding sites in solution.The quantity of hapten in the unknown sample is determined by measuring the amount of specific antibody bound to the solid phase, This measurement is accomplished by an enzymatic technique in which antislobulill bound to 1st anti body and anti enzyme enzyme immune complex are added in sequence.The anti gloublin functions to bridge the bound hapten specific antibody with the anti enzyme enzyme immune complex which is the indicator system. One then measures the enzymatic activity of the solid phase in the presence of substrate. A radioimmunoassay, similar to CELIA in principle, has been developed by Zollinger and Mandrell infect. and Immun. 18 424, 1977 to serotype bacteria. In this procedure, specific typing antibody is preincubated with a heterologous antigen distinct from hapten preparation. The reaction mixture is then added to microtiter wells passively coated with antigen homologous to the typing antisera. The amount of antibody bound to the solid phase which has an inverse relationship with the degree of antigenetic similarity shared by the heterologous test antigen and the solid phase homologous antigen is determined by wadding a radio labeled anti globuxin and then measuring the amount of label bound to the solid phase. .. The primary advantage of using a solid phase hapten, that is a lapten bound to a solid phase, as. in the CELIA procedure, is that the sensitivity of the hapten assay can be increased dramatically by using labeled anti gloSulin as the indicator system rather than labeled hapten. The reason for enhanced sensitivity pertains to the increased number of enzyme labels that can be linked to antibody relative to hapten molecules. In the former case, three to four enzyme molecules can be successfully linked to a single antibody resulting in a conjugate that will demonstrate both antibody and enzymatic activity. In contrast, a single hapten molecule can be labeled with only one enzyme molecule. In reality, the final product would be a population of enzyme molecules to which three or four hapten molecules are covalently bound. If a solid phase hapten is employed in a competitive immuno assay, each hapten specific antibody reacting with the solid phase would result in either three to four or six to eight enzyme labels being bound depending on whether labeled hapten specific or labeled second antibody was employed. In contrast, if one employs a hapten specific antibody solid phase in a competitive imzuno assay, each solid phase antibody could react with two labeled hapten molecules resulting in only two enzyme labels being bound.Thus, the enhanced sensitivity of the immunoassays which employ solid phase hapten and labeled antibody is due to increased amplification of the serologic reaction by virtue of having more labels involved on a unit basis. Unfortunately, simple inexpensive methods for attaching haptens to solid phases have not heretofore existed. However, the method set forth in copending U.S. patent application, Serial No. , filed t entitled Method of Passively Adsorbing Immuno Reactive Haptens to. Solid Phases, of which Harold R. Cooper and Andrew O Beirne are the inventors said application being assigned to the assignee of the present application for the first time provides a hapten bearing carrier in a simple improved procedure, Most of the existing immunoassay methods either require the use of radioisotope labels, which labels are potentially hazardous to the user, have short shelf lives and are expensive to measure due to the cost of the necessary instrumentatio3, or employ enzymes as labels. However, it is technically difficult to covalently bind the proper number of haptens to an en yme and still retain adequate enzymatic activity. Certain of the immunoassays are relatively insffective and certain of the assays are cumbersome, time consuming and inaccurate. It therefore would be desirable to be able to provide an improved immunoassay method which would not require the use of a radioisotope or enzyme tagged hapten and would demonstrate increased sensitivity over methods employing such tagged havens. The improved method shy led be adaptable to any given hapten assay. Summary of the Invention The method of the present invention satisfies all the foregoing needs. The method is substantially as set forth in the Abstract above. It is simple, inexpensive, rapid, reproducible and effective. Moreover, it is safe, does not employ hazardous materials, and is two to twelve times as sensitive as assays employing tagged haptens. Moreover, it is readily adaptable to any given hapten assay. The method involves contacting a sample of a first immune reactive substance selected from haptens, antigens and mixtures thereof, with two substances either simultaneously or sequentially, the substances being, first, a reagent containing a known concentration of an antibody specific for that first immuno reactive substance and either simultanously or thereafter contacting. the reagent and sample with a solid phase containin a known concentratibn of a second immuno reactive substance selected from haptens, antigens and mixtures thereof, reactible with the antibody, that second immuno reactive substance being passively adsorbed to the solid phase. The hapten bearing said phase can be provided, for example, in accordance with the previously described co pending U.S. patent application,Serial No. The contacting is continued for a time sufficient to cause the first and second immuno reactive substances to competitively combine with the antibody. The solid phase is then separated with the second immuno ractive substance and combined antibody attached thereto. The antibody is then labeled by any suitable means and the extent of labeling is determined to detect the concentration of antibody and therefore the concentration of the first immuno reactive substance in the sample. The labeling can be done enzymatically although, if desired, radioactive labeling or other means can be employed. The method of the present invention is simple, rapid and inexpensive and it yields excellent results. Moreover, it is substantially more sensitive than conventional methods.Further features of the present invention are set forth in the following detailed description, Detailed Description In accordance with the method of tne present invention, an antigen or hapten iz detected and quantitated. The method includes contacting a sample containing an unknown quantity of a first immuno reactive substance selected from haptens, antigens and mixtures thereof with a a known quantity of a reagent containing a known concentration of an antibody specific for the first immuno reactive substance and b a solid phase having a known concentration of a second immuno reactive substance selected from haptens, antigens and mixtures thereof, reactible with the antibody, the second immuno reactive substance being passively adsorbed to the solid phase. The contacting is for a time sufficient to cause the first and second immuno reactive substances to combine competitively with the antibody. The reagent referred to above which contains a known concentration of the antibody specific for the first immuno reactive substance can comprise an aqueous solution, suspension or dispersion o the antibody. The antibody may be, for example, sheep anti igoxin or rabbit anti thyroxine. Normally, when carrying out the method of the present invention, such reagent contains between about 0 1 and about 0.001t by volume concentration of the antibody, The solid phase referro to above can be prepared in any suitable manner, but preferably is prepared in accordance aith the method specified in the aforesaid copending U.S. patent application, serial No. . As set forth in detail in that application, the solid phase containing the second immuno reactive substance selected from haptens, antigens and mixtures thereof is prepared by first covalently binding it to an appropriate macromolecular carrier, The hapten or antigen may be any one or more of a wide variety of materials, for example, drugs, hormones, antibiotics, pesticides and the like, The macromolecular carrier may be any suitable material which permits the hapten to be conveniently covalently bound to t, as by a selected coupling reagent.Typical macromolecular carriers hay be, for example, bovine serum albumen, human serum albumen albumen and polylysine The coupling reagent normally used to effect the covalent binding between the hapten or antigen and the macromolecular carrier include glutaraldehyde, carbodiimides, ajisocyanates, O carboxymethy hydroxylaminest anhydrides diazonium compounds and dihalogenated dinitrobenzenes. Additional coupling reagents are as follows hydrazidese azides, cyanogen bromide, N,N o phenylenedimaleimide, m maleimidobenzoytl N hydroxysuccinimide ester and the like. Selection of the particular coupling reagent will depend upon the particular hapten or antigen and macromolecular carrier. Typical examples of such selections are set forth in the table below TABLE HAPTEN OR SAMPLE NO. ANTIGEN MACROMOLECUIAR CARRIER COUPLTNG REAGENT 1 gentamicin bovine serum albumin glutaraldehyde 2 digoxin human serum albumin periodate sodium boro hydride 3 thyroxine bovine serum albumin glutaraldchyde 4 triiodothyronine bovine senm albumin glutaraldchyde In effecting the covalent binding, the coupling reagent may be added to a solution or mixture of the hapten and or antigen and macromolecular carrier, the concentration of the coupling reagent varying with the particular system involved, As a typical example, in the sample listed as No, 1 in the table above, the coupling reagent is initially mixed with the macromolecular carrier to provide a concentration of coupling reagent to carrier of about2 1 by weight, whereupon after a 3 hour incubation period at room temperature, the solution is chromatrographed on a column of cross linked dextran Csith a molecular weight exclusive limit of 2500 and the first 20 ml after the void volume collected. To the resulting mixture is added 200 mg of hapten which is incubated for about 20 hours at room temperature with stirring, whereupon 500 mg of glycine is added.The resulting mixture is incubated an additional two hours at room temperature, after which this conjugate solution is dialyzed for about three days against distilled water at room temperature and then iyophilizeds The carrier hapten antigen conjugate prepared in accor dance with the above is diluted in a buffer of carbonate bicar bonate, pH 9.6 to a selected concentration of about 100 ng ml, Other concentrations, pH s and buffers can be used, It is preferred that the conjugate in the liquid pahse be in a concentration of about 10 ng ml to about 200 ng ml when contacting the solid phase. Such solid phase may be any suitable material capable of adsorbing the conjugate within a reasonable amount of time. Preferably the material is one from which a standard test tube or microtiter well can be conveniently fabricated, for example, polystyrene, polyethylene or polyvinyl acetate, Such substrate or solid phase should be capable of adsorbing the conjugate within, for example, about. 15 24 hours. After such adsorption, the solid phase is washed free of unbound conjugate, for example, by washing the microtiter plates containing microtiter wells with phosphate buffered saline solution fortified with a surfactant or the like. Alternatively, distilled water can be used to wash the icrotiter free of the unbound conjugate.Air drying or the like is then used to provide the solid phase in the finished storable form. . In carrying out the method of, the present invention, the sample containing the first immuno reactive substance to be detected and quantitated is contacted with the above described reagent containing the antibody specific for that immuno rea tive substance, either simultaneously with the initial contact c f. the sample with the solid phase or before initial contact with t ,lid phrase is effected. If the contact with the reagent precedes the contact with the solid phase, then the present method is said to be carried out in an indirect competitive manner.If the sample contacts the reagent and the solid phase for the first time and simultaneously then a direct competitive technique is employed. The indirect competitive technique can be carried out merely by intimately mixing the reagent and sample together and allowing sufficient time, for example, about 0.5 to two hours, for the reaction to take place between the antibody and first immuno reactive substance. The combined liquid mixture is then brought into contact with the solid phase. After the sample has contacted the solid phase for a time sufficient so that first and second immuno reactive substances have had a full opportunity to compete for combination with the antibody, then, in accordance with the present invention, the solid phase is isolated, bearing with it the second immunoreactive substance still adsorbed to its surfaces and also bearing with it that proportion of the antibody which has been bound by the second immuno reactive substance. The isolation of the solid phase can be effected in any suitable manner.For example, in most instances the solid phase will comprise the walls and bottom of microtiter wells into which the liquid sample has been added1 either simultaneously with the previously described reagent or after the reagent has been added to the example. In any event, the sample and reagent will be present together in the titer well and isolation of the solid phase may merely consist of pouring the combined mixture of the liquid sample and reagent out of the well and then washing the well with distilled water or a selected buffer such as, for example, phosphate buffered saline PBS with a surfactant or the like, to substantially completely free it of the combined mixture of reagent and liquid sample. Further, in accordance with the method of the present invention the antibody which is bound to the passively adsorbed second immuno reactive substance on the solid phase is labeled with any suitable selected labeling agent. For this purpose, one can, utilize a radioactive labeling material such as 125I or an enzyme labeing material, for example, an enzyme labeled anti globulin which in any event will attach to the antibody bound to the second immuno reactive substance on the solid phase.Typical enzyme labeled anti globulins comprise alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase, glucose oxidase and ss D galactose, The particular technique for effecting the labeling will depend upon the particular labeling material. As one specific example, when a radjoacLive labeling reagent such as 1251 is used to label sheep anti rabbit InG, the labeled reagent having a specific activity of 300 to 1200 cpm ng, can be added in a typical concentration of about 20 ng of active antibody per 250 a1 PBS at room temperature to microtiter wells containing the solid phase haptem to which hapten specific rabbit antibody is bound, The contacting between the radioactive labeled material and the antibody can be maintained, for example, for about 30 minutes or until the serologic reaction is complete.The radioactive reagent can.then be removed, as by decanting, and the microtiter well can be water washed free of traces of the same before the concentration of the radioactive label remaining in the titer well is detected by conventional radiation monitoring equipment, such as a geiger counter or the like. In the event that enzyme labeling is utilized, as a specific exampl√®, alkaline phosphatase labeled sheep anti rabbit IgG is added in an aqueous solution in a concentration of about 250 ng specific antibody ml to a microtiter well containing solid phase hapten to which rabbit hapten specific antibody is bound,A specific volume, such as 250 p1 of the reagent containing the enzyme labeled anti globulin reagent is used and a contact time of, for example, 30 minutes at a temperature of 20 25 C is employed.After the serologic reaction has been accomplished, the concentration of the labeled agent bound to the antibody is determined as a measure of the amount of antibody bound to the solid phase and also as a measure of the first immuno reactive substance initially present in the sample. To accomplish this, each microtiter well is filled with a specified volume of enzyme substrate, for example, p nitrophenyl phosphate or the like.Hydrolysis of the substrate by enzymatic activity fom the enzyme covalently bound to the antibody is then measured spectrophotometrically after the substrate has been incubated in the microtiter well or a suitable period of time. For example, the enzyme alkaline phosphatase attached covalently to sheep anti rabbit IgG in turn attached to the solid phase hapten adsorbed to the surface of the walls of microtiter wells is used to.hydrolyze the substrate p nitrophenyl phosphate.The hydrolyzed substrate is then detected spectrophotornetrically as a measure of the antibody concentration. The results obtained indicate the amount of hapten or antigen in the sample and also the nature of the hapten or antigen. Further features of the present invention are set forth in the following specific two examples EXAMPLE I a. Preparation of Digoxin Human Serum Albumin Conjugate.

The enzymatic reaction was stopped at this point by the addition of 50 l of 3N NaOH to each well. The reaction was measured spectrophotometrically be determining the absorbance value for the contents in each well at 405 nm. The mean value for each of the thyroxin standards was computed and used to construct a standard curve which appears below Pig. 2 . The amount of thyroxin in the unknown samples was determined from that standard curve. ABSORBANCE 405 nm EMI17.1 THTROXI E ng ml Fig. 2 Inhibition curve for thyroxine Examples I and II set forth in paragraphs above clearly illustrate that the method of the present invention is simple, inexpensive and effective for determining the presence and the concentration of selected antigens and haptens in a safe, rapid and sensitive manner. The method employs solid phases to which selected immuno reactive haptens or antigens have been adsorbed.The method is equally adaptable to labeling by the enzyme or radioactive procedure or, for that matter,coloro metrically or in other ways. The increased sensitivity of the method in comparison with those which employ labeled haptens is at least about 2 to 4 times. The technical difficulties of covalently binding haptens to enzymes while retaining enzymatic activity is obviated. Moreover, the method can easily be carried out in standard microtiter plates and other conventional analytical equipment. Various other advantages are as set forth in the foregoing.
