# Expandable thermoplastic polymer beads and process for their production.

## Abstract
Expandable thermoplastic polymer beads are described which comprise composite beads consisting of a core and a skin and containing a foaming agent the core being composed of a polymer made from one or more vinyl monomers the skin being composed of an olefin polymer containing some or all of said vinyl monomers the foaming agent being a gas or a liquid at ordinary temperatures and pressures and having a boiling point below the softening point of the core material of the beads. Furthermore a process for the production of the expandable thermoplastic polymer beads is described, which comprises suspending grains of a vinyl polymer, a powdered olefin polymer, one or more vinyl monomers and a cross linking agent in an aqueous medium containing a dispersing agent, and polymerizing the vinyl monomers in the presence of an initiator, wherein a foaming agent is added to the dispersion mixture during or after the polymerization or grains of the vinyl polymer containing the foaming agent are used as starting material, the foaming agent being a gas or a liquid at ordinary temperature and pressure.
