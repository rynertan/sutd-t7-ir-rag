## Description
CREATION OF DNA SEOUENCES ENCODING MODIFIED PROIt1SL LIN PRECURSORS Background of the Invention Insulin is manufactured in the pancreas initially as pre proinsulin which is cleaved to form proinsulin.Proinsulin contains three amino acid segments, A and B chains which form the insulin molecule and a C chain connecting the A and the B charts. In vivo, the C chain is cleaved to yield insulin by enzymes that have not yet been identified. The synthetic production of insulin has presented numerous problems. The DqA sequence encoding proinsulin can be inserted into a vector and placed into production cells wherein proinsulin is expressed. However, without the specific enzymes, in vivo cleavage of the C chain does not,occur. The C chain may be cleaved in vitro, but additional cleavages of the A and B chain also occur, significantly reducing the yield of insulin by this method. The A and B amino acid chains may be separately synthesized and then bonded to one another without theC chain. This has the drawback that the A and B chains must be separately purified. In addition, the n and B chains frequently align themselves into incorrect configurations without the C chain. Sunnary of the Invention There are provided compositions and metllods for the production of insulin. Accorlillg to the present invent ion, insulin is produced by a process comprising the in vivo synthesis of a modified proinsulin precursor. Modified proinsulin precursors comprise proinsulin precursors comprising proinsulin having an anino acid substitution selected from the group consisting of aspartic acid substituted for the anino acid at the amino terminus of the C chain, nethionine substituted for the amino acid at the carboxyl terninus of the C chain, and combinations thereof. The preferred proinsulin precursor comprises human proinsulin. A DNA sequence encoding modified proinsulin precursors is prepared by annealing at least one select oligonucleotide primer to a vector containing a singlestranded DNA sequence encoding a proinsulin precursor.In a preferred embodinent, the primer is annealed to a single stranded complementary DNA cDNA encoding a proinsulin precursor comprising human proinsulin that has been inserted ,nto an M13 vector. To effect the substitution of aspartic acid for the amino acid at the amino terminus of the C chain, the primer contains a nucleotide triplet encoding aspartic acid and sufficient nucleotides complementary to a single stranded1 message synonynous DNA sequence encoding the proinsulin precursor to eEèctively anneal the primer to the single stranded DNA sequence at a position wherein the aspartic acid encoding triplet encoues the amino acid at the carboxyl terminus of the C chain. Likewise to substitute aspatc acid for the amino acid at the amino terminus of the C chain, a primer that is the complement of the above described primer is pretjared and annealed to a singlewstranded coding DNA sequence encoding the proinsulin precursor. To effect the substitution of methionire for the amino acid at the carboxyl terminus of the o chain, the primer contains a nucleotide triplet encoding methionine and sufficient nucleotides complementary to a single stranded DNA 3equence encoding the proinsulin precursor to effectively anneal the primer to the single stranded, nessage synonymous DNA sequence at a position wherein the methionine encoding triplet encodes the amino acid at the carboxyl terminus of the C chain. Similarly, to substitute methionine for the amino acid at the carboxyl terninus of the C chain, a primer that is the complement to the above described primer containing a triplet encoding methionine is annealed to the single stranded coding DNA sequence encoding the proinsulin precursor. To identify vectors containing an altered DNA sequence encoding modified proinsulin precursors following cloning, a nucleotide sequence containing a restriction enzyme recognition sequence is also annealed to the singletranded, message synonymous DNA sequence encoding the proinsulin precursor. Preferably, the primer contains uch a restriction enzyme recognition sequence.Alternatively, a nucleotide sequence containing the complement of a restriction enzyme recognition sequence is annealed to the coding strand of the DNA sequence. After the primer and, if needed, a nucleotide sequence containing a restriction recognition sequence or its complement have been annealed to the vector, tha primer is extended and ligated to form a circular double stranded vector which is then inserted into cells such as E. colt.The cells and the vectors replicate. This forms at least two groups of vectors, one group comprising an unalteredDNA sequence encoding normal proinsulin and a second group comprising an altered DNA sequence encoding modified proinsulin precursors. The vectors carrying the altered DNA sequence can be identified by conventional techniques such as electrophoresis following digestion with the restriction enzyme and are then isolated. The altered DNA sequence is then cleaved from the vector and inserted into a second vector capable of expressing high levels of proinsulin in production cells. If modified proinsulin precursors containing both amino acid substitutions are desired, two primers, each containing a nucleotide triplet capable of effecting one of the desired substitutions or its complement, may be annealed slinultaneously or in sequence to the singlestranded DNA sequence encoding a proinsulin precursor gn either the or orientation. It is preferred that the second primer be annealed in a successive step rather than simulaneously. After vectors containing an altered DNA sequence in which one primer has been incorporated have been isolated, one strand of the double stranded altered DNA sequence of the vector is exposed. The second primer and, if necessary, a second nucleotide sequence containing a restriction enzyme recognition sequence or its complement are annealed to the single stranded altered DNA sequence and then extended and ligated The double stranded vector thus forned is again introduced into E. coli cells wherein the cclls and vector replicate. Vectors containing both DNA sequence alterations are then identified and isolated. The twiee altered DN sequence encoding modified proinsulin precursors having both amino acid substitutions is then cleaved from the vector and inserted into a new vector expressing high levels of proinsulin precursors in a production cell of choice. Modified proinsulin precursors produced in the cells are recovered and purified. A preferred general method for recovery and purification is by specific absorption to mcnoclonal antibodies attached to agarosebead chrorographic media. The ironoclonal antibodies are prepared to have a specific affinity for a particular fragment of the modified proinsulin precursor molecule.Following washing of the nonocional antibody column, the modified proinsulin precursor is desorbed. The C chain and amino acid chains attached to the amino terminus of the B chain and the carboxyl terminus of the A chain are cleaved from the modified proinsulin precursor in vitro to yield insulin. Insulin thus produced is purified by solvent fractionation, salt precipitation, specific absorption on a monoclonal antibody column and the like. Detailed Description According to principles of the invention, insulin is produced by cleaving a modified proinsulin precursor in vitro. Proinsulin is composed of three amino acid chains, designated A, B and C. The C chain connects theA and B chain and is cleaved from the proinsulin to yield insulin, which is composed of the A and B chains.Proinsulin precursors comprise proinsulin and may contain an amino acid chain preceding the B chain, i.e., attached to the amino terminus of the a chain, and or may contain ais amino acid chain following the A chain, i.e., attached to the carboxyl terminus of the A chain. By convention, the anino acids of proinsulin are labeled according to position starting at the amino terminus of the B chain. The method herein is applicable to all proinsulin precursors, particularly those comprising human proinsulin in which neither the B chain nor theA chain of proinsulin contain the amino acids methionine or aspartic acid. Human proinsulin has a sequence of 86 amino acids.The B chain consists of the amino acids at positions 1 through 30. The C chain of human proinstilin consists of anino acids at positions 31 through 65 and the A chain consists of amino acids at positions 66 through 86.Cleavage of human proLnsglin to form insulin occurs between the amino acids at positions 30 and 31 and between the amino acids at positions 65 and 56. The lengths and compositions of the A and B chains of insulin are highly conserved evolutionarily, i.e., fairly constant from animal to animal. However, the length and composition of the C chain of proinsurn does vary widely according to the source. A modified proinsulin precursor differs from such a proinsulin precursor in that the modified proinsulin precursor contains an tno acid substitution therein aspartic acid is substituted for the amino acid at the amino terminus of the C chain, e.g., amino acid position 31 of human proinsulin or methionine is substituted for the amino acid at the carboxyl terminus of the C chain, e.g., amino acid position 65 of human proinsulin or aspartic acid is substituted for the amino acid at the anino terminus of the C chain and nethionine is substituted for the amino acid at the carboxyl terminus of the C chain. In addition, at least one peptide chain may be present either attached to the amino terminus of the a chain or the carboxyl terminus of the A chain.The appended amino acid chains may either contain sequences allowing the in vivo cleavage of proinsulin, such as the native human proinsulin prepeptide, or the anino acid chain preceding the B chain may contain methionine at the 1 position of proinsulin, and or the amino acid forning the amino terminus of the amino acid chain following the A chain may be aspartic acid, thus allowing cleavage in vitro. In a preferred embodiment for the production of a modified proinsulhz precursor, a complementary DNA cDNA sequence encoding a protnsulin precursor comprising human proinsulin is inserted into a double strandedM13 vector. The cDNA is made by extracting RNA transcribed by naturally occurring chromosomal DNA from human insulin producing pancreatic cells and then naking aDNA copy from the RNA. The cDNA is inserted into a circular double strandedM13 vector by first cleaving the M13 vector and the cDNA leaving intact the gene encoding human proinsulin with an endonuclease which forms cohesive ternini at the cleaved ends of the M13 vector and the cDNA or by joining cohesive ends to the cDNA enzymatically. The cDNA ifi annealed to the vector by mixing, and, if necessary, ligated with DNA ligase, which catalyzes the formation of phosphate bonds between the cDNA and the vector. E. coli cells are transforned with the M13 vectors by standard techniques. For example , the cells may be grown on a suitable medium to a particular optical density followed by concentrating the cells in a series of steps.The cells are suspended in a calcium chloride or manganese chloride rubidium chloride solution at reduced temperatures about 0 C to 5 C and then mixed with the M13 vectors at the reduced temperature. The mixture is then heated to about 35 C to about 450C for up to 5 minutes and again chilled. The cells are then transferred to a growth medium. In the cell, the vector replicates. A portion of the double stranded vectors form circular single stranded vectors which is the viral form of Ml3. The single stranded vectors are extruded through the cell membrane into the supernatant and recovered. A synthetic oligonucleotide primer is then annealed to the single stranded vectors containing the cDNA sequence in either the or the orientation by mixing in a buffered solution. The f orientation refers ge to the orientation in which the me message synonymous strand of the cDNA appears in the single stranded vector. The orientation refers to the orientation in which the coding strand of the eDNA, i.ee, the complement of the orientation, appears in the single stranded vecQor0 The manipulations discussed below apply equally well to vectors in either the or the or orientation0 although only those applicable to vectors in the orientation are described in detail.For vectors in the orientation, the complements of the primer would be used. The primer comprises three consecutive nucleotides, i.e., a triplet, encoding aspartic acid and sufficient nucleotides on each side of the triplet that are complementary to the message synonymous single stranded cDlÁ to enable the primer to anneal to the single stranded cDNA at the position in which the triplet encoding aspartic acid corresponds to the triplet encoding amino acid position 31 of human pro insulin. Nucleotide sequences forming triplets encoding aspartic acid are known. These include triplets having the base sequences ATC and GTC wherein Prefers to cytosine, T refers to thynine, A refers to adenosine andG refers to guanine read in the 5 w3 direction. The nucleotide sequence of a cDNA sequence encoding human proinsulin is also known. The primer further comprises nucleotides on each side the aspartic acid encoding triplet which are complementary to the nucleotides of the message synonymous cDNA on each side of the triplet encoding the amino acid arginine at amino acid position 31 of human proinsulin.The number of nucleotides in each of these sequences is sufficient to effectively anneal the primer to the message synonymous cDNA. Typically, this requires at least three complementary nucleotides on each side of the aspartic acid encoding triplet. The presently preferred primer contains six complementary nucleotides on each side of the triplet en oding aspartic acid. The base sequence of the preferred primer is CTCCCGXXXGGTCTT wherein XXX may be ATC or GTC.The nucleotide sequence having the base sequence CGTCTT is complementary to the portion of the message syncnymous cDNA strand for encoding anino acid positions 29 and 30 of human proinsulin and the nucleotide sequence having the base sequence CTCCCG is complementary to the portion of the message synonymous cDWA strand for encoding amino acid positions 32 and 33 of human proinsulin. The triplet having the base sequence ATC is presently preferred as the aspartic acid encoding triplet. It is preferred because it forms, with adjacent nucleotides, the Pvu I restriction enzyme recognition sequence having the base sequence CCATCG which is useful in identifying the altered sequence following cloning. A primer containing the triplet having the base sequence GTC may also he used but requires that some identifiable factor such as a restriction enzyme recognition sequence also be annealed to the DNA template. After the primer an, if necessary, tulle restriction enzyme recognition sequence have been annealed to the message synonymous cDNA, the annealed sequence is extended using DNA polymerase. This is accomplished by mixing in a buffered solution the single stranded vector with the aranealed DNA sequences with sufficient deoxyguanosine 5 triphosphate dGTP , deoxyadenosine 5 triphosphate dATP , deoxycytidine 5 triphosphate dCTP and deoxythymidine 5 triphosphate dTTp 0 DNA ligase is also added, to ligate the ends of the annealed DNA sequences once they have been extended.This forms a circular double stranded vector The double strdnded vector is then introduced intoE. coli cells, again using a standard technique. A very small percentage of E. colt cells ae actually inoculated with the vector. The cells are spread out on an agr gel and allowed to grow. The double stranded vector is theL allowed to replicate.Relication produces two group rf double stranded vectors, one group containing cDIJA encoding p oinsulin precursors comprising normal human proinsulin and a second group containing altered cDNA encoding modified proinsulin precursors comprising human proinsulin with aspartic acid substituted for arginine at anino acid position 31. E. coli cells containing the M13 vector grow at a slower rate than those cells r.ut containing the vector.As the cells grow, plaques, i.e., holes in the growing cell population, are formed where the cells containing the M13 vectors are replicating. Each plaque is a substantially pure population having only one form of the cDNA, i.e., either encoding proinsulin precursors comprising normal human proinsulin or encoding the modified proinsulin precursors. To acertain if cells from a particular plaque contain vectors having the altered cDNA, vectors from a portion of the cells of the particular plaque are digested with the restriction enzyme that recognizes the Pvu I site. The vectors having the restriction enzyme recognition sequence will be cleaved by the restriction enzyme, thereby forming non circular DNA fragment. The vectors not containing the recognition sequence will remain intact. Identification of the digestion products is then made, e.g., by electrophoresis on an agarose gel. E. coli cells identified as containing M13 vectors having the altered cDNA sequence are cultured in liquid media. Single stranded vectors confining the altered cDNA are extruded through the cell wall into the supernatant and recovered. To produ e a modified proinsulin precursor having methionine substituted for arginine at amino acid position 65 .l addition to aspartic a td substituted for erginlne at amino acid position 31, a nucleotide triolet encoding methionin is substituted for the naturalll ocer, ing nucleotide triplet encoding arginine at amino actd position 65 of human proinsulin in the message synonymous cDNA previously altered to encode aspartic acid at amino acid position 31. To effect this substitution, second primer ij annealed to a single stranded vector containing the previously altered cDNA iri the orientation. The primer contains the triplet having the base sequence CAT, which encodes the amino acid methionine, plus sufficient nucleotides on each oldie of the triplet that are complementary to the message synonymous cDI4A template to enable the primer to be effectively annealed to the cDNA template so that the methionine encoding trtplet encodes the amino acid position 65 of. human proinsulin. The nucleotide sequence of the preferred primer contains the base sequence AATGCCCATCTTCTG wherein the nucleotide sequence having the base sequence CTTCTG is complementary to the portion of the message synonymous cDNA template encoding amino acid positions 63 and 64 of proinsulin and the nucleotide sequence having the sequenceAATGCC is complementary to the portion oe the message synonymous cDNA template encoding amino acid positions 66 and G7 of proinoulin. The preferred nucleotide sequence of the primer is particularly suitable because it contains the Mbo restriction enzyme recognition sequence leaving the base sequence TCTTC enabliny later idesltification of the modified vector. The annealed sequence is extended and ligated as previously described yielding a circular double stranded veKtceO The double stranded vector is again introduced into E. coli cells and allowed to replicate. Again, plaques form from those cells containing the M13 vector. To identify double stranded vectors containing modified cD21A sequence encoding both amino acid substitutions, vectors from cells of a particular plaque are digested with the restriction enzyme that recognizes the Pvu I site and the restriction enzyme recognlzing the bo II site. The double stranded cDNA sequence having both recognition sequences. is cleaved by both restriction enzynes. Modified cDNA sequences encoding both amino acid substitutions are identified by electrophoresis on an agar gel. Once the vectors containing the double stranded cDNA sequence encoding modified proinsulin precursors having both substitutions have been identified, E. coli cells containing those vectors are cultured. Double stranded vectors are then separated fron the cells and the vectors are cleaved with restriction endonucleases to yield the altered cDNA fragment. The altered cDNA fragment is then isolated. A second vector, known to express high levels of proinsulin in a production cell, such as the tryptophan fusion vector containing cDNA encoding human proinsulin is also cleaved by the same endonuclease to remove the natural cDNA. The second vector is then isolated. The altered cDtlA sequence isolated from the M13 vector is then inserted into the second vector. The second vector is then inserted into production cells and allowed to replicate. Cells containing the second vector are separated and cultured to produce a populat1 ns expressing high levels of mcdified prolnsulin precursors. A preferred general method of isolating the modified proinsulin precursor comprises preparing a nonoclonal antibody against a particular fragment of the modified proinsulin precursor, for example, the sequence from position 32 to 48 of the C chain. A synthetic peptide having such a suitable sequence is then prepared. Mice are then immunized with the peptide and monoclonal antibodysecreting cells are recovered by the process of polyethylene glycol mediated cell fusion. Cells secreting monoclonal antibodies against the particular human proinsulin fragnent are identified by sandwich radioimmunoassay. Monoclonal antibodies are purified from the supernatants of the culture fluid, and attached to chronatographic agarose beads to generate a matrix having a specific affinity for that humar, proinsulin fragment. The modified proinsulin precursors elaborated by the production cell of interest are isolated by specific absorption to the nonoclonal antibody column. A preparation of the modified proinsulin precursor is concentrated and partially purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate added in an amount empirically determined to precipitate the modified proinsulin precursor. The partially purified preparation is then passed through the monoclonal antibody column, and the column is washed to remove unabsorbed contaminant proteins. Modified proinsulin precursors are then specifically desorbed by passing an an non ium carbonate buffer of pH approximately 10 and ionic strength of about 0.1 through the column. Modified proinsulin precursors that have been isolated are then cleaved at the carboxyl terminus of the C chain, i.e. between position 65 and 66, and0 if necessary, at the anino terminus of the B chain0 i., position 1, by treatment with cyanogen bromide Modified proinsulin precursors are freed from extraneous salts by dialysis and lyophilization and then dissolved in pure formic acid, diluted to about 70 with water, and cleaved with 100 to 200 fold excess of cyanogen bromide over methionyl residues. About 5 mg of modified proinsulin precursor are dissolved in each ml of formic acid.The reaction proceeds for about 24 hours at room temperature in the dark, after which the cleavage products are lyophilized to remove excess reagent. Cleavage at the amino terminus of the C chain, i.e., between amino acid position 31 and 33 and, if necessary, at the carboxyl terminus of the A chain is affected by dissolving the modified proinsulin precursor in about 0.01 M ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 containing 2 M urea.The modified proinsulin precursor is dissolved to a concentration of about 5 mg ml, and cleavage is carried out by addition of P. fragi mutant Me 1 enzyme in about 1 100 the concentration of the modified proinsulin precursor i.e., about 50 ug ml . The reaction is allowed to proceed for about 24 hours at about 370C. Insulin liberated from cleaved modified proinstilin precursor is purified by conventional procedures. As indicated, the above described nethod works equally well when the. coding strand of the cDNA appears in the single stranued form of the vector. In this situation, the primers that are prepared and annealed to the vector are the complements of the above described primers. For example, to effect the substitution of aspartic acid for arginine at amino acid position 31, the preferred primer that is annealed to the coding strand would have the base sequence AAGACCGATCGCGAG which is the complement of the primer having the base sequence CTCCCGATCGGTCTT which is annealed to the messagesynonynous strand. Likewise, a primer having the base sequence CAGAACATGGGCATT is preferred to be annealed to the coding strand to effect the substitution of methionine to arginine at amino acid position 65. This primer is the complement of the above described primer having the base sequence AATGCCCATCTTCTG. In the production of a DNA sequence encoding modified proinsulin precursors, M13 is the presently preferred vector because of its unique ability to exist in both a double strandt3 and a single stranded form. This enables a primer to be annealed to the single stranded viral form without first chewing back one strand. However, a double stranded vector or plasmid may be used. This requires that prior to annealing the synthetic primer to the cDNA present in the double stranded vector on plasmid, one strand of the double stranded cDNA nust be chewed back. The nucleotide sequence of the primer is adjusted according to which strand of the cDNA is removed. This process may be accomplished by cleaving the circular double stranded vector or plasmid having a natural cDNA sequence encoding proinsulin. The cleavage is made at one end of the natural cDNA with an endonuclease.The cleaved plasnid or vector is then treated with an exonuclease to chew back, e.g., in the 5. 30 direction, one strand of the double stranded cDldA starting at the cleaved end. The exonuclease must chew bacs one strand of the cDItA sufficiently to provide a single stranded nucleotide sequence of sufficient length to enable the synthetic primer to be annealed to the single stranded portion of the cDNA at the appropriate position9 The synthetic primer is then annealed to the single stranded portion of the cDNA extended, and both strands ligated to form a circular double stranded vector or plasmid, which is then introduced into E. coli and allowed to replicate. Subsequent procudures are as previously described for M13. The disadvantage of this method is the difficulty in knowing when to terminate the action of the exonuclease which tends to reduce the efficiency and reliability of this method. It is presently preferred to anneal a synthetic primer encoding an anino acid substitution at anino acid position 31 of proinsulin followed by annealing a primer encoding an amino acid substitution at amino acid position 65 to the single stranded M13 vector having natural cDNA.However, if both substitutions are desired, both primers may be annealed simultaneously rather than in sequence.However, there may be a disadvantage in annealing the two primers simultaneously because of the probability of achieving the desired result. The success rate for recovering an altered cDNA sequence can be as low as 1 in 20. Isolation and identification ot a plaque having cells displaying the desired altered cDNA in a subsequently grown colony may be accomplished relatively quickly as at least about 1 in every 20 plaques will have the desired DNA alternation. Simultaneous annealing of two synthetic primers may result in a success rate of as low as 1 in 400. This could require isolation and identification of about 400 such plaques to find one with the desired characteristics.Accordingly, detection of such a plaque requires relatively lengthy analysis. The previously describe method of isolation and separation using monoclonal antibodies is presently preferred as a general method. Another preferred method for recovery of modified proinsulin precursors expressed as E. coli tryptophan operon fusion peptides exploits the high insolubility of proteins including human proinsulin containing tryptophan operon peptide amino termini. The insoluble fusion protein3 are easily purified from lysed E. coli cells by differential centrifugation in the presence oe physiological salt concentrations 0.1 to 0.2 molar IQaCl . Other conventional techniques, such as conventional ion exchange and gel exclusion chromotography, may be used successfully. An alternate preferred embodiment for cleavage of the C chain of the modified proinsulin precursors is particularly utile if certain bacteria and yeasts are used as production cells. Certain cells comprise the capability of cleaving the initial amino acid chain preceding the B chain ainino terminus of proinsulin. If such production cells are used, the cDNA is altered to provide a modification of human proinsulin at only the amino terminus of the C chain wherein aspartic acid is substituted for arginine. No substitution is made at the carboxyl terminus of the C chain0 The procedure for effecting the substitution at the amino terminus of the C chain and for isolating the proinsulin thus modified is the same as previously described, Cleavage of the C chain to fcrm insulin may be accomplished by digestion with P. fragi mutant enzyme as previously described for about 24 hours.This cleaves between amino acid positions 30 and 31 of the inodifled proinsulin precursor and, if necessary, between the carboxyl terminus of the chain and the amino terminus of an anino acid chain following the A chain. After about 24 hours, trypsin is added in about 1 1000 of the concentration of the modified proinsulin precursor. Digestion is allowed to continue for a predetermined length of tine, typically about 2 hours. The trypsin digestion cleaves between amino acid positions 65 and 66. The reaction is stopped by rapid cooling or by addition of an inhibitor such as soybean trypsin inhibitor, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, or p toluenesulfonyl fluoride. Insulin produced by this method is purified by conventional procedures such as solvent fractionation, salt precipitation, specific absorption on a monoclonal antibody column and the like.
