# Catalyst, catalyst component and process for the polymerization of olefins.

## Abstract
A process for polymerizing alpha olefins in the presence of a catalyst comprising two components. Component A is obtained by mixing a magnesium dihydrocarbyloxide com pound with a tetravalent, halogenated titanium compound and then contacting the resultant product with a dihydrocar bylmagnesium compound. Component B comprises a metallic hydride or an organometallic compound, e.g. an organoaluminum compound.
