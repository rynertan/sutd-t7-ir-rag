# Data processing apparatus having a system reset capability.

## Abstract
To avoid circular system reset lock out in data process ing apparatus of the kind having a system reset capability which includes a system reset function followed after a tim ed interval by an initial program load procedure for each functional path within the apparatus associated with the reset, which apparatus includes two channels 12, 13 in terfacing separately with the control unit 14 of a data storage arrangement 16 in such a way that if one channel is exercising the control unit via its interface 17, 18 , the other channel is inhibited from access to the control unit via its interface by a control unit busy signal, detection lo gic is incorporated in the control unit to detect, for eych interface, that a system reset function is in process via that interface and, for the duration of such detected circum stances to inhibit the effect of system reset caused control unit busy indications in relation to the channels.
