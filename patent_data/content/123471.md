# LASTING SIDES OF SHOES USING TACKS

## Abstract
A tack side lasting machine has two combined wiper and tack insertion devices 25 36 43, 45 73, 75 5 to 8 which operate progressively along opposite side portions of the shoe. Each such device includes a friction element 25 36 43 73 which first engages the shoe in the high wood region 26 of the upper 2 and is then moved in a direction towards the lasting margin 3 and over the insole edge. The friction element may be in the form of a strap member 25 43 , a friction roller 36 or a runner like rigid drafting element 73 . A top line presser member 35 70 may be associated with the friction element for clamping the top line region 28 of the upper 2 against its last 1 .
