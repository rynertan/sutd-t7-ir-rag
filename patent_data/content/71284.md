# Energy converter.

## Abstract
An energy converter comprises a series resonant bridge circuit 1 tuned to a constant frequency, a number of parallel connected output transformers 2, 3 accommodated in the bridge circuit and energy buffers 6, 7 coupled to the secondary winding of each of the output transformers 2, 3 . By means of control circuits 23, 24 activated by the voltage across the different energy buffers 6,7 the current through the primary winding of a relevant output transformer 2 or 3 is controlled in such a way that the voltage across the corresponding energy buffer 6 or 7 remains constant.
