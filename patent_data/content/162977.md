## Description
This invention relates to a monoclonal antibody, to a method for producing the antibody, to a diagnostic of the diagnostic reagent in a highly sensitive and specific immunoassay of a proteolytic procoagulant enzyme in biological samples, for example biological fluids such as human and animal serum, plasma, tissue extracts and histologic sections. The presence of this enzyme is indicative of malignant disease, and the immunoassay described may be used as part of a diagnostic test for cancer. For years, investigators have sought to identify substances that are unique to tumor cells for use as diagnostic markers of cancer. In 1970, Bubenek et al, reporting in Many tumor antigens have been identified and characterized during the past 20 years. Most notable among these are carcinoembryonic antigen CEA , alpha fetoprotein AFP and acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated antigen cALLA . Carcinoembryonic antigen was first described by Gold and Friedman Alpha fetoprotein is a protein of about 70 kd with amino acid composition similar to that of serum albumin, is produced by fetal liver and can be detected in amniotic fluid and maternal serum. Alpha feto protein has also been found to be present in hepatocellular carcinoma. AFP is elevated in the serum of about 80 of patients with liver tumors, almost all those with teratocarcinomas, 15 of patients with gastric carcinoma, 3 of patients with colorectal carcinoma, 24 of patients with hepatic carcinoma, and 25 of patients with biliary tract carcinomas see Ruddon, Recently, acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen cALLA has been studied to determine its effectiveness in identifying acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients see Ritz, et al, There are a large number of other tumor associated antigens that have been studied for their potential as tumor markers. Tumor markers to the following human cancers are reviewed by Hellstrom et al, Cancer procoagulant was originally identified during studies to seek a substance that initiated the abnormal blood coagulation associated with malignant disease. This protein has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. It is a cysteine protease that initiates coagulation by directly activating factor X in the coagulation cascade. Cancer procoagulant appears to have no carbohydrate 1 mole sialic acid, or hexose mole of cancer procoagulant , it has a molecular weight of about 68,000 from all species that have been examined, including mouse, rabbit, and human. Cancer procoagulant is eluted from a 1.5 M agarose gel filtration column in the void volume indicating that the protein aggregates into a very high molecular weight complex 1.5 x 10⁶ daltons during this type of gel filtration procedure. It is a single polypeptide protein with the molecular weight of 68 kd and an isoelectric point of about 4.8. It is inhibited by mercury and iodoacetamide, properties that are characteristic of cysteine proteases. To determine the distribution of cancer procoagulant activity in various tumor types, a variety of human tumor extracts and some of their normal tissue counterparts and a variety of serum free culture media from transformed cells and media from their normal cell counterparts were examined. It was found that cancer procoagulant activity existed in extracts of malignant cells and tissue culture medium from transformed cells, but not in extracts of normal tissue and serum free medium from normal cells and culture. The discovery of cancer procoagulant was first reported in 1975 Gordon et al 1975 Thromb. Res. In two abstracts published in March and May, 1984, respectively, it was suggested by Gordon et al that a monoclonal antibody to cancer procoagulant might serve as a tumour marker in an enzyme immunoassay for the diagnosis of cancer Gordon et al 1984 Proc. Ann. Meet. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. The present invention is predicated on the discovery of a method whereby an immunologically active monoclonal antibody to cancer procoagulant, useful in a diagnostic reagent for the detection of cancer in a patient, may be obtained. It is well know that monoclonal antibodies against a specific antigen can be obtained by the classical fusion technique of Köhler and Milstein Nature 1975 However, this method does not lead, in the case of cancer procoagulant, to a monoclonal antibody which is immunologically active and therefore of any value. In accordance with the present invention we have discovered that, in order for immunologically active monoclonal antibodies to cancer procoagulant to be obtained, it is necessary that medium from the cells producing the desired antibody, as obtained in step e above, be subjected to the step of dissociating antibody from cancer procoagulant antigen produced by the hybrid cells used for the production of the antibody prior to isolating the antibody, as in step f above. Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method for producing immunologically active monoclonal antibody to cancer procoagulant which comprises steps a to f as set forth above and is characterized by the dissociation step, performed between steps e and f , which has been defined in the preceding paragraph. In another aspect, the present invention provides dissociated immunologically active monoclonal antibody to cancer procoagulant, said monoclonal antibody being substantially free of procoagulant activity. Further, the present invention provides a reagent for detection of cancer procoagulant comprising immunologically active monoclonal antibody produced by the method of this invention. Still further, the present invention provides a method for detecting for the presence of cancer procoagulant in a biological sample of a patient, which comprises contacting the biological sample with a reagent which contains immunologically active monoclonal antibody of this invention, as defined above, or produced by the method of this invention, and detecting the presence or absence of an immunological reaction. The biological sample may be, for example, serum, plasma, tissue extracts, urine and histological sections. This method for detecting for the presence of cancer procoagulant has high sensitivity and specificity, and therefore is a valuable technique for use in the diagnosis of cancer. The following description is presented in order to provide a thorough understanding of the subject matter and the experimental procedures used in the present application. A 0.5M stock solution of diisopropylfluorophosphate DFP was prepared in dry isopropyl alcohol and diluted 1 100 in samples for DFP treatment. Crude phospholipid was obtained by chloroform methanol 3 1 extraction see Benzamidine Sepharose affinity resin was prepared by coupling ε amino caproic acid to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose and 100 mg of p aminobenzamidine was coupled to 2 g of hexanoylsepharose with soluble carbodiimide for 24 hours while maintaining the pH at 4.75. After thorough washing of the resin with distilled water, at 1 x 11 cm column was packed and equilibrated with a 10mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 containing 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. The flow rate of this column was 0.5ml min. A gel filtration column 1.5 x 100 cm was packed with 1.5M agarose and equilibrated with 10 mM veronal buffer at pH 7.8 containing 0.5 mg ml of crude phospholipid and then washed free of excess phospholipid with 10mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 . The flow rate of this column was about 1 ml min. A phenyl Sepharose hydrophobic chromatography column 1 x 5 cm was equilibrated in 10 mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 containing 0.5 mg ml of crude phospholipid, washed free of excess phospholipid with the veronal buffer and finally equilibrated with 10 mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 . The column was used at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min. A p chloromercurialbenzoate agarose affinity resin was prepared by equilibration of the resin in 25mM 2 N morpholine ethane sulfonic acid buffer at pH 6.8. The equilibrated resin was packed in a 1 x 10 cm column and run at a flow rate of about 1.0 ml minute. All column chromatography elutions were monitored at 280 nm, and the protein content of aliquots of pooled fraction samples from each step of the purification was routinely determined. V2 carcinoma cells were injected into the thigh muscle of young 2 kg New Zealand white rabbits and the animal s weight and tumor size were monitored bi weekly until the animal s weight began to decline and the tumor was large. The tumor was removed surgically prior to the animal s death. Tumors ranged in size from 50 to 200 g. Tumor tissue was cut into 0.5 to 1 cm thick slices to increase surface area and extracted by placing it in 3 changes of 20 mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 for 3 hours each. The Factor VII depleted bovine plasma was used to determine the dependence of the procoagulant activity on Factor VII, using Russell s viper venom and rabbit brain thromboplastin as positive and negative controls, respectively. DFP sensitivity and activity in Factor VII depleted bovine plasma were two criteria used throughout the purification procedure as identifying characteristics of the enzyme and to distinguish cancer procoagulant from normal tissue thromboplastin. A two stage coagulation assay was used to determine the direction activation of pure bovine Factor X by cancer procoagulant. The first stage contained 0.64 µg of purified bovine Factor X in 0.5 ml of 50 mM Tris HCL buffer pH 7.8 containing 10 mM CaCL₂ and 0.15 M NaCl, 10 µg crude rabbit brain cephalin in 20 µl saline and from 5 to 10 ng of purified cancer procoagulant such that the ratio of cancer procoagulant to Factor X was from 1 60 to 1 128. A portion of the purified samples was adjusted to 5 mM DFP, incubated at 25 C for 30 minutes and added to the first stage of the assay. Partially purified Russell s viper venon standard was diluted 1 100,000 with saline and used in a ratio of 1 320,000 with Factor X. Aliquots 100 ml of the first stage reaction mixture were taken at various time intervals, including 0 time, and assayed for Factor Xa activity in the second stage by mixing with 100 µl of bovine plasma depleted of Factor VII and Factor X and 100 µl of 20 mM CaCl₂. If any Factor Xa was detected in the Factor X samples, they were treated with 25 mM DFP to inactivate the Factor Xa and then dialyzed to remove the residual DFP prior to its use. To visually demonstrate the direct proteolytic activation of Factor X by cancer procoagulant, 19 µg of purified bovine Factor X in 15 µl of 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.8 containing 10 mM CaCl₂ and 0.15 M NaCl, 2.5 µg of crude rabbit brain cephalin in 5 µl of saline was incubated with .38 µg of cancer procoagulant. In the control experiment, 13.6 µg of Factor X was incubated with 90 pg of Russell s viper venom in the same reaction conditions. Aliquots 10 µl were removed at 30 seconds, 5 hours., and 15 hours, 2 µl of 0.05 M EDTA were added, and the aliquot was added to ¼ volume of sample buffer without β mercaptoethanol for analysis on a 12.5 sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Step 1 The concentrated crude tumor extract was applied to the benzamidine affinity chromatography column and unbound protein was washed from the column with 10 mM veronal buffer pH 7.9 containing 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. The bound protein was eluted with 1.0 M propionic acid. The acid elute fractions were brought to pH 7.5 immediately with 4N NaOH or they were collected in an equal volume of 0.5 M veronal buffer pH 8.0 to partially neutralize the propionic acid and then adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH. All the DFP sensitive, Factor VII independent procoagulant activity was recovered in the acid eluate. The fractions containing procoagulant were pooled, concentrated about 20 fold on an ultrafiltration PM 10 membrane and dialyzed against 10 mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 to remove sodium propionate. The quantitative recovery of the procoagulant activity was greater than 100 , probably due to the removal of protease inhibitors present in the tumor extract. Step 2 The concentrated, dialyzed acid elution peak from the affinity column with a protein concentration of from 6 to 10 mg ml, was applied to a 1.5 M agarose gel filtration column. The column was eluted with 10 mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 the elution profile had four major protein peaks with the high molecular weight, peak containing most of the DFP sensitive procoagulant activity. Fractions from the major procoagulant peak were pooled and concentrated about 5 fold by ultrafiltration and carried to the next step in the purification sequence. The recovery of activity from this step was frequently greater than 100 probably due to removal of additional inhibitors. Step 3 The concentrated procoagulant peak was applied to the benzamidine affinity resin, a small amount of unbound protein was washed from the column with 10 mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 containing 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA, and protein adsorbed to either the resin or to bound proteins was removed by washing the column with 0.1 Triton X 100 in 10 mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 . The Triton X 100 was cleared from the column with the initial veronal buffer, 30 mls of 0.05 M propionic acid was used to elute weakly bound proteases, including some procoagulant activity, and then 40 mls of 0.5 M propionic acid was used to remove the remaining bound proteins. The acid eluates were either adjusted to pH 7.5 immediately, or collected in 0.5 M veronal buffer to partially neutralize the propionic acid as described in Step 1. The samples were dialyzed against 10 mM veronal buffer to remove the sodium propionate, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. No procoagulant activity was recovered in the unbound protein sample and little or no activity was recovered with the protein eluted by Triton X 100. About 30 of the procoagulant activity was recovered in the 0.05 M acid eluate the remaining 70 was in the 0.5M acid eluate which was carried to the next step of the purification. Although the acid eluate from this purification step formed a single immunoprecipitin band on immunoelectrophoresis against an antibody to partially purified cancer procoagulant is contained 3 to 4 protein impurities when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Step 4 About 1.0 ml of the sample eluted from the second benzamidine affinity column was applied to the PCMB affinity resin in 20 mM veronal buffer pH 7.7 and washed onto the column with 40 ml of MES buffer ph 6.8 , 40 ml of 1 M urea and 1 Tween 20 in MES buffer, 20 ml MES buffer to clear the urea and Tween from the column, 35 ml of 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 35 ml of 5 mM dithiothreitol, 35 ml of 10 mM dithiothreitol, and finally 35 ml of 100 mM dithiothreitol to strip the column of residual protein. Protein eluted from the column was continuously monitored at 280 nm. The protein peaks were collected separately and concentrated about 10 fold on an ultrafiltration membrane and dialyzed against MES buffer to remove the dithiothreitol. Protein was eluted in each of the washes a small amount of procoagulant activity was eluted in 0.1 mM DTT with the major peak of activity in the 5 mM eluate. Step 5 The concentrated, dialyzed procoagulant sample from the PCMB Sepharose column was applied to a phenyl Sepharose hydrophobic affinity column in 10 mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 containing 10 µg ml of crude phospholipid. The sample was allowed to equilibrate with the column for 10 minutes and then unbound protein was eluted with 10 mM veronal buffer pH 7.8 . Procoagulant was eluted with 10 dimethyl sulfoxide in veronal buffer, concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed free of dimethyl sulfoxide against veronal buffer. Although about 20 procoagulant activity was recovered in the veronal buffer, dimethyl sulfoxide eluate generally contained most of the remaining 80 of the activity and was a single protein band by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separation procedure uses a number of modifications not previously found, or expected, in the conventional separation of proteins The second step of the purification procedure utilized the observation that the procoagulant enzyme aggregated when concentrated to more than 2 mg of protein per ml of sample. This permits it to be resolved from other proteins with molecular weights less than 150,000, a molecular weight cut off that is common for most serine proteases. Following gel filtration column chromatography, the benzamidine affinity chromatography step was repeated, but adsorbed impurities were removed with a nonionic detergent 0.1 Triton X 100 and a low level of propionic acid 0.05 M was used to elute weakly bound proteases, including some cancer procoagulant, before the remaining proteases were stripped from the column with 0.5 M propionic acid. A final hydrophobic affinity chromatography step resulted in highly purified protein. The overall purification and recovery were impossible to calculate accurately because inhibitors present in the crude extract masked the procoagulant activity and the instability of the procoagulant resulted in slow but continuous loss of activity. However, the final product of the purification sequence appears to be homogeneous cancer procoagulant enzyme. Also, phospholipid was used to preequilibrate the columns, and routinely added to samples during the purification, including the purified enzyme, because it was demonstrated to improve both the stability and activity of the procoagulant. Analytical polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis was carried out with 10 or 12.5 gels at pH 8.9. Aliquots of samples 4 parts were added to 1 part of a sample buffer solution containing 10 β mercaptoethanol, 10 sodium dodecylsulfate, 40 glycerol and 0.01 pyronin Y in 0.125 M Tris base. Non reduced samples were prepared in the same sample buffer with β mercaptoethanol omitted. The samples were heated for 2 minutes in boiling water and applied to the gel. The molecular weight of the pure procoagulant was estimated by determining the electrophoretic migration of proteins with known molecular weight. Analytical polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing was carried out with precast 4 LKB gels according to the standard LKB procedure. The isoelectric point of the pure procoagulant was determined both by the location of proteins of known isoelectric point, and by determining the pH gradient by measuring the pH of 0.1 M KC1 solution containing 0.5 cm gel slices. Purified cancer procoagulant appeared as a pair of protein bands on a wide pH range pH 3.5 to 9.5 analytical polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing gel at a pI of about 4.8 and 4.9. Analysis on a narrow pH range pH 4.0 to 6.5 gel resolved the pI 4.9 protein band into 2 protein bands, suggesting that there were 3 isozymes of cancer procoagulant. The amount of procoagulant activity in milliequivalents of rabbit brain thromboplastin meq RBT and protein mg content of the purification sequence for a representative purification is tabulated in the following Table I. The specific activity SA, meq RBT mg protein , the recovery of activity and the increase in specific activity purification were calculated from data obtained. It is believed that recoveries greater than 100 are probably due to the removal of procoagulant inhibitors during purification. The enzyme obtained by this purification technique has a molecular weight of about 68,000, and is believed to be a single polypeptide chain since the electrophoretic migration was not affected by reduction with β mercaptoethanol. When tested by analytical sodium dodecylsufate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a single protein band was observed. Furthermore, this enzyme differs from other coagulation enzymes in that it activates Factor X. By suspending the purified cancer procoagulant in Freund s adjuvant and injecting it into goats, it has been possible to obtain procoagulant specific antibody which results in a single immunoprecipitin band upon electrophoresis. This antibody can be purified by techniques such as immunoaffinity chromatography and used in the determination of cancer procoagulant in body fluids by conventional RIA or enzyme immunoassay diagnostic protocols, as will now be illustrated by Examples I IV below. Purified cancer procoagulant antigen was obtained from rabbit V2 carcinoma, human amnion chorion tissue or other cellular sources, according to procedures described above. In the second purification technique, the extract sample was applied to the immunoaffinity resin in 20 mM veronal buffer, the column was placed on a rotating wheel and allowed to rotate overnight so that the sample and resin were thoroughly mixed. The next morning the column was allowed to settle and the column was washed with 20 mM veronal buffer until all unbound protein was washed off the column the absorption at 280 nm is the same as that of the buffer this required from 250 350 ml of buffer. The column was washed with 100 ml of 5 deoxycholate dissolved in 20 mM veronal buffer deoxycholate should be recrystallized from acetone water 3 1 followed by 3 4 column volumes of 20 mM veronal buffer. This removed all adsorbed proteins from the column. The column was eluted with 100 ml of 3 M NaSCN followed by 50 100 ml of veronal buffer. The eluate was dialyzed immediately against 20 mM Bis Tris propane buffer pH 6.5 at 5 overnight. The dialyzed eluate was concentrated on an Amicon PM10 ultrafiltration membrane and assayed for activity as described below. Every third or fourth run the column was cleaned with 5 M NaSCN and reequilibrated with veronal buffer. This immunoaffinity procedure removed the majority of contaminating proteins from the cancer procoagulant sample. A p chloromercurial benzoate PCMB organomercurial Agarose column Affi gel 501 was purchased from Bio Rad. The column was prepared according to the Bio Rad technical information. The column was equilibrated in 20 mM Bis Tris propane buffer pH 6.5 . The sample was applied to the column and washed slowly onto the column with 20 mM Bis Tris propane buffer. The column was allowed to stand for 1 hr at 4 C and washed slowly overnight with 20 mM Bis Tris propane buffer. When the absorption at 280 nm was the same as that of the Bis Tris propane buffer, the column was washed with about 50 ml of 1 M urea and 1 Tween in water and followed by enough 20 mM Bis Tris propane buffer to completely remove all residual Tween urea from the column. The column was eluted with HgCl₂ or glutathione, and each elution was dialyzed immediately in 20 mM Bis Tris propane buffer at 4 C overnight with several changes of buffer. The samples were concentrated on a PM10 ultrafiltration membrane and checked for activity as described above. The purified samples from the goat immunoaffinity column and the PCMB affinity column were evaluated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the protein content of each sample was determined with the Lowry protein determination. The activity in the samples was preserved by making them 1 mM with HgCl₂ which will inhibit and preserve the activity for later use. One hundred micrograms of purified CP was emulsified in an equal volume of complete Freund s adjuvant and injected subcutaneously in multiple sites along the goat s spine. Booster immunizations were made at 3 week intervals by suspending 30 50 µg of purified CP in equal volume of incomplete Freund s adjuvant and injecting the goat in the same way. Blood samples were obtained by jugular vein venipuncture at monthly intervals and tested for antibody by crossed immunodiffusion. After 4 months, an antibody titer of 1 16 was reached. This level of antibody has been sustained for a minimum of 12 months. The goat antibody a polyclonal 1gG immunoglobulin was partially purified from goat serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE cellulose ion exchange chromatography by standard techniques. The partially purified antibody was found to contain antibodies to rabbit serum proteins, probably minor contaminants from the purified CP preparations of rabbit V2 carcinoma. To remove these contaminating antibodies, rabbit serum was coupled to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose to form a normal rabbit serum protein affinity column, and the partially purified goat antibody preparation was passed over the normal rabbit serum column to remove the contaminating antibodies. The resulting goat IgG preparation was free of cross reacting antibodies with normal rabbit serum. These partially purified goat antibodies were used for immunoaffinity chromatography and in the immunoassay system. Using the second purification technique described above, mice were immunized with purified CP to raise B cell antibodies as described by Yelton et al, in The IgM samples obtained from the hybrid cells either as medium from tissue cultured cells or ascites fluid contained procoagulant activity. In a representative experiment, Balb C mice were injected with 0.5 ml of pristane to desensitize their immune system. Three weeks later, the mice received 2 x 10⁶ hybridoma cells intraperitoneally, and ascites fluid was drained 3 or 4 times at 2 day intervals from the mice by intraperitoneal needle stick until the mice died. Ascites fluid was assayed for procoagulant activity, activity in factor VII depleted plasma and inhibition by mercury and the procoagulant activity was tentatively characterized as that of cancer procoagulant. Since cancer procoagulant is believed to be an oncofetal antigen, and hybrid cells are developed from a malignant cell line the myeloma variant , it is understandable how the antigen could be associated with the hybrid cells. Therefore, it is also probable that the IgM antibody is bound to the antigen in the ascites fluid, rendering it immunologically unreactive in the assay system. Therefore, it was necessary to separate the antigen from the antibody so that the antibody was rendered immunologically reactive to antigen in other samples. The ascites fluid was made 3 M with urea and applied to a 1 x 90 cm 1.5 M agarose gel filtration column that was preequilibrated in 3 M urea. The sample was eluted from the column in 3 M urea and the first peak void volume was assayed for IgM and procoagulant activity it was free of procoagulant activity and contained all of the IgM. A second peak from the column contained procoagulant activity and no IgM . Fractions from the first peak were pooled, dialyzed against at least 3 changes of 5 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 , the sample was concentrated over an Amicon XM50 ulrafiltration membrane, and refrigerated overnight in a centrifuge tube. The next morning, a precipitate had formed in the test tube, it was removed by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS. The resuspended precipitate sample was found to contain the immunoreactive IgM fraction, and a small amount had remained behind in the supernatant. This purified IgM was assayed against purified antigen, using 2 normal human serum as a control blank and gave a sample to blank ratio of from 10 to 20. The unpurified ascites gave a sample to background ratio of from 2 to 4, the supernatant gave a sample to background ratio of 6 to 10. This purified IgM was then used in the immunoassay. There are other methods for dissociating antigen antibody complexes so they can be separated. Such methods may include higher concentrations of urea, low pH pH 2 3.5 , 5M guanidine HCl, high pH pH 10.5 12 and combinations of dissociating agents and pH adjustment. All such methods for separating antibody cancer procoagulant antigen complexes are included within the perview of this application. Two separate immunoassays for the quantification of cancer procoagulant were developed. The first immunoassay system was a direct ELISA in which antigen was adsorbed to the surface of the wells in a 96 well Immulon I microtiter plate at room temperature for 2 hrs, the well was rinsed with phosphate buffered Tween 20, the open sites on the wells were blocked with 2 normal human serum in phosphate buffer at 37 C for 1 hr, and the wells were washed 3 times with 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.05 Tween 20. Purified IgM antibody was diluted 1 200 in phosphate buffer and 50 µl was added to each well and incubated at 37 C for 1 hr. The wells were washed 3 times with phosphate buffer containing .05 Tween PTB . One to 1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase labeled rabbit antimouse IgM antibody was added to each well, incubated for 1 hr at 37 C, the wells were washed with PTB and 100 µl of p nitrophenyl phosphate 5 mg ml in 10 diethanolamine buffer pH 9.8 containing 0.1 mg MgCl₂.6H₂0 ml and 0.2 NaN₃ and incubated at 37 C for from 45 to 90 min until color intensity is adequate to read , and then the plate was read on a Dynatech microtiter plate reader which measured absorbance at 405 nm. In a second ELISA procedure a sandwich or double antibody ELISA , the Immunolon I microtiter plate was coated with 1 to 40,000 dilution of partially purified goat IgG and incubated for 2 hrs at 25 C, the wells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline PBS and open sites in the wells were blocked with 2 human serum in phosphate buffer. The wells were washed 3 times with PTB, 50 µl of the antigen sample usually diluted 1 2 with PTB 0.15 M NaCl was added to each well and incubated at 25 C for 2 h, the wells were washed again with PTB, 50 µl of 1 to 200 dilution of IgM in PBT was added and incubated at 25 C for 2 hrs, and the amount of IgM was measured as described above. Both of these assays were used to measure purified antigen, purified antigen added to normal human serum, serum from cancer patients, extracts of tumors and other biological samples. The first assay worked better for more purified samples, the second assay worked better for samples like serum and other samples that contain a large number of other proteins that competed with the antigen for binding to the surface of the well because the antigen was absorbed out of the biological sample onto the goat antibody, and the monoclonal antibody was used to quantitate the amount of antigen. Both ELISA procedures were able to detect 10 ng of purified antigen. The ELISA method is one of a variety of immunoassay techniques that could be employed to assay for cancer procoagulant antigen in biological samples. Other methods include radioimmunoassay, immunoinhibition assay, immunofluorescent assay and immunoprecipitation assay all such assays that include the use of an antibody to quantitate the cancer procoagulant antigen should be construed to be included under the description of the assay. To prove the effectiveness of the ELISA according to the present invention to diagnose cancer, a large number of serum samples from documented cancer patients and non cancer controls were tested in blind runs. Table 1 contains the data obtained from the immunoassays conducted and includes the categories of cancers evaluated, the number of individuals studied, the number of samples correctly identified, and the percentage of correctly identified samples.
