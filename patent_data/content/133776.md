# DISTRIBUTING GOBS IN A GLASSWARE MANUFACTURING MACHINE

## Abstract
A gob distributor has two scoops 14, 16 , one arranged to be aligned with some sections of the machine to deliver gobs thereto and the other arranged to be so aligned with other sections of the machine. Turning means 28, 30, 34 is operable to turn the scoops to bring them to desired orientations for alignment with their respective sections and moving means 22, 24 is operable to move the distributor to bring either of the scoops below a feeder orifice from which gobs are supplied. In this way, the scoops share the distribution function. If more than one gob is to be supplied simultaneously, further pairs of scoops 18, 20 can be used.
