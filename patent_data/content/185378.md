## Description
This invention relates to a virtual computer system as described in the preamble of claim 1. Such a system is known from FR A 2 232 010. A virtual machine system hereinafter referred to as VMS makes it possible to run apparently simultaneously a plurality of operating systems hereinafter referred to as OS 506, 507 on one bare machine hereinafter referred to as BM as shown in the conceptual view of Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings. To accomplish the system, a specific control program such as a virtual machine monitor which will be hereinafter referred to as VMM 502 is prepared instead of directly disposing a base machine interface between BM 501 and each OS 506, 507, and this control program operates directly under BM 501 through the base machine interface 503 and provides a base machine interface 508 equivalent to the base machine interface 503 to each OS 506, 507. The machine which is conceptually produced when VMM 502 thus produces the base machine interface 508 is referred to as a virtual machine hereinafter referred to as VM . In Fig. 1, VM 504 for which OS 506 operates and VM 505 for which OS 507 operates are shown, but an arbitrary number of VMs can of course be formed. VM 504 and VM 505 are changed over under the control of VMM 502 so that OS 506 and OS 507 operate apparently simultaneously. OS 506 and OS 507 provide extended machine interfaces 513 and 514 for user programs hereinafter referred to as UP 515, 516, 517 and 518, and extended machines hereinafter referred to as EM 509 512 are formed. Each of EM 509 through 512 has the function of executing the processing in accordance with a processing request for a certain bulk function from UP associated therewith which request is called a supervisor call or a function call inside its OS and the function of base machine interface. OS 506 and OS 507 are different from each other, therefore, EMs belonging to the respective OSs e.g., EMs 509 and 511 have mutually different functions. As described above, VMS enables a plurality of mutually different OSs to run apparently simultaneously on a single BM. As a result, the following effects can be expected. Therefore, a specific control program VMM 502 exists in order to accomplish VMS. To operate VMs 504, 505 highly efficiently, VMM 502 divides the hardware resources of BM 501 time wise and spatially by use of multi programming techniques and allots them to each VM 504, 505. The instruction for operating the hardware resources is dealt with as a so called privileged instruction in order to insure the overall completeness of the system in VMS, and can be executed only in an operation mode called a privileged mode . Upon detecting that such a privileged instruction is generated from OS 506 or 507, VMM 502 interprets and executes the instruction by itself, and after completion of the instruction, returns the control to the operating OS. This processing is necessary in order to use in common the resources of BM 501 between VMs, and this processing time is an overhead inherent to VMS. Since the common use of a main memory is realized by the technique of the virtual memory system, the time necessary for the address conversion also becomes an overhead. Attempts to reduce the overhead 3 described above are disclosed in the FR A 2 232 010 mentioned at the beginning. In the EP A 0 171 475, which falls within the terms of Article 54 3 EPC, a virtual computer system is disclosed which operates a plurality of virtual machines on a single bare machine under the control of a virtual machine monitor program. This known system comprises a first register holding data designating a running virtual machine among said virtual machines, the access to said register being made under control of an instruction included in a monitor program of said virtual machines. The known system provides also groups of second registers which are provided in addition to the conventional system registers, respectively. Each group of said registers is allotted to each of said virtual machines and holds the same kind of data. Furthermore, register selection means are provided which brings one group of said second register groups into an accessible state by a program instruction in response to the designation data in said first register. However, in this known system, there remains in particular the overhead due to simulation of the interruption processing of VMM, when an interruption from an external device occurs. Conventionally, VMS has been examined in the field of large scale general purpose computers or main frame processors. It is believed that the inventions disclosed in the afore mentioned prior art references are also directed to large scale general purpose computers. On the other hand, micro computer technique has made a remarkable progress in recent years due to the remarkable progress in LSI technique with the consequence such that so called personal computers hereinafter referred to as PC consisting of the combination of a micro computer with peripheral units have come to gain wide applications. A large number of application programs have been developed for a variety of PCs, and the desire has occurred for the users of micro computers to use attractive application programs that have been developed for other models. However, these application programs are prepared so as to operate under specific operating systems OS . Particularly in the case of PCs in general, since the applicability of an application program is generally limited to the micro computer for which it is developed. Therefore, in order to use such an application program to other PCs having different OSs, it is generally necessary to replace the OS or to change the OS dependent portion of the application program in order to use the application program for PCs having different OSs, and they are extremely inconvenient. As means for solving the problem, the employment of VMS which enables a plurality of OSs to operate on a single bare machine would be extremely effective because the OS for a PC is by far smaller than that of main frame OSs. At present, however, PCs are not equipped with means for reducing the overheads of VMM described above. An improved method of minimizing these overheads is indispensable for the application of VMS for PC. It is the object of the present invention to provide means for reducing the overheads due to the simulation processing of the interruption processing of VMM described already when an interruption from an external unit occurs. Starting from the prior art mentioned at the beginning, is this object solved by the features described in the characterizing part of claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the present invention are included in subclaims 2 and 3. According to the present invention, the processor or the bare machine is equipped with means for comparing the value of an interruption mask level of the status word of a corresponding VM with an external interruption level value generated, and means for delivering an interruption number and an interruption start signal to an instruction execution control unit inside a micro processor if the interruption operation is found possible as a result of comparison, and for delivering an interruption suspension signal to the instruction execution control unit in the micro processor if an interruption inhibition condition is found established as a result of comparison. Since the judgement of the possibility of interruption resulting from the occurrence of the external interruption is made by hardware according to this arrangement, the overheads of the simulation processing that is effected by VMM can be reduced.

Fig. 2 shows an example of a micro computer in which the present invention may be utilized. In the drawing, reference numeral 301 represents a micro processor CPU 302 is a clock generator CLOCK 303 is an interruption control circuit and 304 is a main memory RAM . RAM 304 stores therein a control program VMM 502, OS 506, user program 515 and the like shown in Fig. 1, and VMM 502 contains control data such as control block. Reference numeral 305 represents a memory control unit MCU , 306 is a disk control circuit, 307 is a magnetic disk file DISC , 308 is a printer control circuit, 309 is a printer PRT , 310 is a display keyboard D K control circuit, 311 is a display CRT equipped with a keyboard KEY , 312 is a communication control circuit, and 313 is a communication circuit device. Suitable peripheral circuits may be selected, whenever necessary, and those not shown in the drawing may also be used. CPU 301 and each component are connected to each other by an address bus ‚Ñì52, a bidirectional data bus ‚Ñì53, control signal lines ‚Ñì54 ‚Ñì58 for each portion and a response signal line ‚Ñì59 from each portion. CPU 301 sends a desired memory address to the address bus ‚Ñì52, and sends also control data to the control signal line groups ‚Ñì54 ‚Ñì58 and to a function line bus ‚Ñì60 so as to read out necessary one among VMM 502, OSs 506, 507, UP 515 and the like Fig. 1 stored in RAM 304. CPU 301 receives the read out data through the data bus ‚Ñì53. In the same way, it receives control data of a control block Fig. 3 or the like, whenever necessary. When an interruption request from units 306, 308, 310, 312 is sent to the interruption control circuit 303 through the signal line group ‚Ñì62, the control circuit 303 generates an interruption level number in accordance with the priviliged order and sends the number to CPU 301 through the signal line group ‚Ñì63. Fig. 3 shows a main memory 200 of the bare machine BM 501 and the control blocks that exist inside the main memory 200. It also shows the relation of correspondence between the virtual main memories 201, 202 for the group of virtual machines VMs 504, 505 and the main memory 200 of the bare machine. In other words, under the virtual computer system, the virtual main memory of each VM is made to correspond continuously with respect to a certain region inside the main memory 200 of the bare machine. Each VM uses a predetermined region from the start address as a vector table inside the region allotted continuously to each VM inside the main memory 200. For example, the main memory 201 of VM‚ÇÅ is continuously allotted inside the main memory 200 of the bare machine, the start address represented by Œ± in the drawing of that VM becomes the vector table 212 of that VM‚ÇÅ. The start address of this VM is pointed from the control block VMLIST‚ÇÇ. The meaning of VMLIST‚ÇÅ and VMLIST‚ÇÇ will be described later. VMM manages the allottment of the region of each VM. The user program 515 and the operating system OS 506 in Fig. 1 operate while regarding the virtual main memory 201 as the main memory of the bare machine. Therefore, OS 506 and UP 515 need not at all recognize that they are operating under the virtual computer system. This is accomplished by a specific control program called a virtual machine monitor 502 which will be hereinafter referred to as VMM . The virtual machine monitor VMM 502 prepares and manages control blocks VMLISTs 205, 206, etc. for VMs, respectively, in order to smoothly manage the operation of each VM. The control blocks 205, 206, 207 exist in the memory region 215 of VMM inside the main memory 200 of the bare machine. The processing program of VMM of its own also exists in the memory region 215 for VMM. The control block VMIDM 207 holds the existing address of the control block 205. The interruption list 214 is a control block which holds the interruption suspension state when an interruption is generated from an external unit and is once accepted, but the corresponding VM is operating under the interruption inhibition state when the interruption is reported to the corresponding VM. As can be seen clearly from Fig. 3, the control block 205 contains therein the start address of the memory region allotted to the corresponding VM inside the main memory 200 and the start address of the vector table 211 of that VM, and VMM refers to and updates the data in order to smoothly carry out the service processing of each VM. Fig. 4 is a block diagram showing the construction of the CPU 301 shown in Fig. 2. In this drawing, reference numeral 55 represents an address register file consisting of a plurality of address register groups, and reference numeral 56 represents a data register file consisting of a plurality of data register groups. The address registers and the data registers are shown as an example of operational registers, and general purpose register groups may be disposed in place of these address and data register groups. Among the signal lines, symbols and represent signal lines to and from outside the CPU chip, respectively. Reference numeral 59 represents a plurality of instruction address registers hereinafter referred to as IAR . IAR is sometimes called a program counter. Reference numeral 55 represents an address register file consisting of a plurality of address counter groups, and reference numeral 56 represents a data register file consisting of a plurality of data register groups. Among these register files, one group of registers are allotted to each VM, and each IAR of the IAR groups is allotted to each VM. Reference numeral 57 represents a register selection circuit deciding which registers of register groups 55, 56 and 59 are to be selected and which IAR is to be selected. This selection circuit will be described later in further detail with reference to Fig. 6. A register file control portion 58 selects the individual registers designated by the instruction from the address register group 55 and the data register groups 56 selected by the register selection circuit 57. A status register control portion 100 constitutes an essential feature of the present system, and it will be described in detail later. In short, this status register control portion 100 has a status register file including a plurality of status registers, and each status register in the status register file is allotted to the virtual machine, VMM or one of a plurality of VMs and holds the status word for a corresponding computer. A VM identification register VMID 105 holds the identification number VM number of VM that is under operation, and its content is utilized in the status register control portion 100 and the register selection circuit 57. The mode register 12 represents the present operating mode and consists of 2 bits. The 0 bit is called a V bit and represents whether the present operating mode of the virtual machine is the operating mode with the V bit being 1 or the operating mode of the bare machine is the operating mode with the V bit being 0 . Even when VMM is under operation, its mode is dealt with as the operating mode of the virtual machine. The first bit is called an H bit and represents a mode in which access is made to the register of the other VM during the operation of VMM. It has a meaning only during the operating mode of the virtual machine. When the H bit value is 0 , there is no meaning, but when it is 1 , it means that one of the address register group 55, the data register group 56 and a plurality of IARs 59 is selected by the number designated by S REG 37. The relation between the V and H bit values of the mode register 12 and the operation will be explained later with reference to Fig. 7. The V and H bit values of the mode register 12 are sent to the register selection circuit 57 through the line ‚Ñì72. The V bit value is sent to the status register control portion and the interruption processing portion 110 through the line ‚Ñì11. Values are set to the mode register 12, VMID 105 and S REG 37 in accordance with the instruction from VMM. The interruption processing portion 110 compares the interruption level signal given thereto through the signal line group ‚Ñì63 with the interruption mask level value given from the status register control portion 100, and accepts the interruption when the former is greater than the latter. The instruction execution control portion 115 sequentially takes out the program instructions stored in RAM 304 and governs the control for interpretation and execution. This control portion is known in the prior art. In detail, the instruction execution control portion 115 consists of an instruction register for holding the program instruction thus taken out, a decoder decoding the program instruction in the instruction register and generating various signals and a micro program control unit executing and controlling the decoded program instruction and controlling the take out of the next program instruction. The microprogram control unit changes over the program instruction to be executed next in response to the status word of the computer and the interruption signal, and so forth. The control signal processing portion 67 transfers and receives various control signals and response signals between the processor 301 and external devices. A temporary holding register T Reg 60, an arithmetic and logic unit ALU 61, a shift calculator 62, a multiplexor MPX 63, a selector 64, a data holding register DR 65, an address holding register ADR 66 and a register file control portion 58 are provided in order to process and transfer the data. VMID 105 and the mode register 12 are set by the instruction generated by the processing program of VMM 502 shown in Fig. 1, and when the processing program is operating in the region 215 inside the main memory 200, they are set when the instruction for setting the VM number to VMID 105 and the instruction for setting the value of the V bit of the mode register 12 to 1 are generated as VMM executes service processing which is referred to as dispatch processing of VM 504. When it is necessary for VMM 502 to refer to the register values of VM 504 and VM 505, VMM 502 generates an instruction for setting the number of such a VM to S REG 37 and an instruction for setting the V bit value of the mode register 12 to 1 and the H bit value to 1 . Hereinafter, the operations for sequentially executing the instructions will be described. The instruction execution control portion 115 reads out an instruction to be next executed from RAM 304 Fig. 2 on the basis of the memory address represented by IAR 59 that is selected by the register selection circuit 57, in the following manner. The content of the selected IAR 59 is held by ADR 66 through MPX 63, from thence sent to the address bus ‚Ñì52. At the same time, the control signal processing portion 67 receives the instruction from the instruction execution control portion 115 through the signal line ‚Ñì65, and delivers necessary control signals to the signal lines ‚Ñì54 ‚Ñì58 and to ‚Ñì60. Upon receiving these signals, MCU 305 reads out the instruction from the designated address of RAM 304, and sends it to the data bus ‚Ñì53 and simultaneously the response signal 1 to the signal line ‚Ñì59. Upon receiving the response signal 1 on the signal line ‚Ñì59, the instruction execution control portion 115 takes the data on the data bus ‚Ñì53 into DR 65, from thence through MPX 63 and the internal data bus ‚Ñì51. The instruction consists of an operation field, a register field and an address field. The instruction data are decoded at the instruction execution control portion 115. Fig. 5 shows an example of the format of the instruction word. In this drawing, the format at the time of the instruction involving the register operation designates the kind of operation e.g., addition in the OP field 45, the register number n in R Register field 46 and modification of operation e.g., identification whether the register as the object of the operation is the data register 56 or the address register 55 in an OPM Operation Mode field 47, respectively. In Fig. 5, symbol D The instruction execution control portion 115 examines the OP field 45, distinguishes the kinds of instructions, and after making preparation for the execution of instruction, calculates the effective memory address described above. It also up dates IAR 59. The address calculation is made using ALU 61, and the final effective address is held by ADR 66. Next, the instruction execution control portion 115 carries out calculation control. In the case of addition shown in Fig. 5, for example, it selects either one of the address register file 55 and the data register file 56 through the register file control portion 58, takes out the data of the corresponding register number and sets it to T REG 60 through the internal bus ‚Ñì51. This data is from thence sent as one of the inputs to ALU 61 through the selector 64. Incidentally, it is hereby assumed that a specific register group of both the register files 55 and 56 is selected by the register selection circuit 57 as will be described elsewhere. The data inside the memory address is read into DR 65 in the same way as the reading of the instruction data described already, by use of the effective address that has in advance been calculated and held in ADR 66, and is then applied as the other of the inputs to ALU 61 through MPX 63, line ‚Ñì69, data bus ‚Ñì51 and ‚Ñì70. As result, ALU 61 executes calculation. When the result of calculation is put into the registers, it is stored in the register having the register number designated in either one of the address register file 55 and the data register file 56 through the signal lines ‚Ñì71 and ‚Ñì51. When the result of calculation is returned to the memory, it is temporarily stored in DR 65 through MPX, is then sent to RAM 304 through the data bus ‚Ñì53 under control of the control signal processing portion 67 and is written into the address designated by ADR 66. Next, the mechanism which selects the required register group and IAR from the address register file 55, the data register file 56 and the IAR group 59 will be explained. Since the number of the running VM is set in advance to VMID 105 by VMM 502, this selection is executed by the register selection circuit 57 in accordance with the VM identification number from VMID 105 and the mode bit from the mode register 12. In detail, the register selection circuit 57 generates a register group selection signal ‚Ñì73 on the basis of the data of the mode register 12 sent through VMID 105 and the line ‚Ñì72, and selects the specific group from a plurality of address register groups 55 and data register groups 56, and one IAR from the IAR group 59. Fig. 6 is a circuit diagram showing in detail the register selection circuit 57. In the drawing, reference numerals 31 and 32 represent inversion circuits, which produce positive signals and inverted signals. Reference numerals 33, 34 and 35 represent AND circuits logical product circuits and reference numeral 36 represents an OR circuit logical OR circuit . Reference numeral 38 represents a selection circuit SEL , and 39 is a decoder DEC . Signal lines ‚Ñì721 and ‚Ñì722 illustrate the signal line group ‚Ñì72. ‚Ñì721 represents the VMM operation mode signal H bit , while ‚Ñì722 represents the VM mode signal V bit . The register selection circuit 57 executes the selecting operation in accordance with the H bit value and the V bit value described above as shown in Fig. 7. In detail, if both of the H and V bit values are 0 , it means the operation mode of the ordinary bare machine, and the selection circuit 57 selects the register group of No. 0 from the register file 55 and the register of No. 0 from the IAR group 59. When only the V bit is 1 , it means the operation mode of the virtual machine, and the selection circuit selects the register group and IAR corresponding to the VM number given from VMID 105. When both the H and V bit values are 1 , the selection circuit selects the register group and IAR designated by the VM number from S REG 37. This operation mode is used when VMM wants to examine the status of each VM or when VMM operates in place of VM. The state in which the V bit is 0 and the H bit is 1 is not used in this embodiment. When the operations inherent to VMM, such as the memory allottment processing inside the virtual computer system or input output processing, are to be carried out, VMM is also regarded as one of VMs. The VM number of VMM is set to 0 in order to cope with such a case. In this case, the operation mode is dealt with as the bare machine mode in the subsequent interruption processing. The operation of the register selection circuit 57 will be described in further detail. First of all, when both the H and V bits of the mode register 12 are 0 , the inversion output signals from the circuits 31 and 32 give 1 to the 2 input of the AND circuit 35. Therefore, the output signal of the AND circuit 35 becomes 1 , No. 0 of the register group selection signal ‚Ñì73 becomes 1 through the OR circuit 36 and eventually, the No. 0 register group and IAR are selected from the address register file 55, the data register file 56 and the IAR group 59. When the H bit value of the mode register 12 is 0 and its V bit value is 1 , the signal output from the AND circuit 34 through the signal line ‚Ñì77 becomes 1 . At this time, the selection circuit 38 sends the VM number given from VMID 105 through the signal line group ‚Ñì74 to the decoder DEC 39. Therefore, any one of the signals of any one of the signal lines of the output signal line group ‚Ñì73 of DEC 39 becomes 1 . The signal line group ‚Ñì73 consists of a signal line for VMM and fifteen signal lines for VM, i.e., Nos. 0 to 15. When any one of signal lines of the signal line group ‚Ñì73 becomes 1 , one each address register, data register and IAR of the corresponding group to the selection signal line ‚Ñì73 generating the 1 output, from the address register file 55, the data register file 56 and the IAR group 59, each consisting of a plurality of registers as shown in Fig. 4. When the value of VMID 105 is 0 , that is, in the case of the VM number allotted to VMM, No. 0 of the signal line ‚Ñì73 becomes 0 through the OR circuit 36, and this state is equal to the case where both of the V and H bits are 0 , that is, the bare machine mode. When both of the H and V bits of the mode register 12 are 1 , the signals of the signal lines ‚Ñì721 and ‚Ñì722 become 1 , and the signal output from the AND circuit 33 through the signal line ‚Ñì76 becomes 1 . At this time, the selection circuit 38 sends to the decoder DEC 39 the VM number that is sent from S REG 37 through the line ‚Ñì75. Therefore, VMM can make access to the operation register group and IAR allotted to a given VM by setting the number of that VM to be referred to, to S REG 37. As can be understood clearly from the description given above, there is eliminated the necessity of the save restore processing of the content of the data register group, the address register group or the instruction registers even when VMs are changed over, and the change over operation can be therefore sped up. The sequence of execution of general, so called non privileged instructions is as described above. In contrast, the instruction of updating of or reference to the status registers belonging to the privileged instruction group operates the status register control portion 100 shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 8 shows in detail the status register control portion 100. The status register file 1 has a group of status registers and consists of flip flops or high speed small capacity memories equivalent to flip flops that are allotted to VMM and each VM, respectively. Each status register holds the status word corresponding to the bare machine, VMM and VM. Ordinarily, the status word represents the operation state of the bare machine, VMM or VM that is under operation, and holds a flag bit representing whether or not the operation mode is the supervisor mode, the interruption mask level number for judging whether or not the processor is under the state in which it accepts an external interruption, and the conditional code CC field for the result of calculation. When the processor CPU 301 is operating in the environment of VMS, prior art systems generate the status word described above for each VM in the control block 205 shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, the content of the status word is updated or referred to by a running VM, or more definitely when an instruction for changing the interruption mask level value is generated, simulation processing is executed so that VMM searches the control block 205 corresponding to that VM and the value is stored in the corresponding field of the control block. This proves to be the simulation overhead of VMM. In contrast, in accordance with the present invention, a status register is provided so as to correspond to each VM as shown in Fig. 8, and these status registers are put together as the status register file 1. According to this arrangement, when the instruction of changing the content of the status word or the instruction of referring to the status word is generated from the running VM described above, VMM executes such an instruction without executing the simulation processing, thereby reducing the overhead of VMM. In short, the status register control portion 100 selects a status register that corresponds to the running VM from the status register file 1 in accordance with the VM number from VMID 105, sends the content to the internal data bus through the operation register in accordance with the reference instruction or updates the content by the updating data from the internal data bus ‚Ñì51 in accordance with the updating instruction, and reflects the result on the status register 11. Here, symbols S When VM is newly executed, the status word for that VM, that is read out from the status register file 1, is set to the operation register 4 and at the same time, transferred to the common status register 11. However, both of the supervisor mode bit S In other words, when the virtual computer system is under operation, a plurality of VMs are operating apparently simultaneously. When the status word of the status register of the running VM is set to the common status register 11 for operation, and if the value of INT The decoder 2 decodes the VM number sent from VMID 105 through the signal line ‚Ñì3, and selects a corresponding status register. The write read control circuit 3 makes the write read control for the status register file 1 in response to the reference updating instruction signal on the signal line ‚Ñì2, and exchanges the data between it and the internal data bus ‚Ñì51 through the signal line ‚Ñì1. The content of the status register read out from the status register file 1 is held by the operation register. The comparator 5 judges whether or not the VM number on the signal line ‚Ñì3 is equal to the output of the 0 value generator 6. The selectors 7 and 8 are changed over by the output of the comparator 5, and selects and sends the output of the 0 value generators 9 and 10 or either one of the supervisor mode bit S In this embodiment, both VMM and bare machine are expressed by the VM number 0 . Here, the reason why the common status register 11 exists besides REG 4 is to distinguish INT The operations are as follows. The VM number sent from VMID 105 through the signal line ‚Ñì3 is applied to both the decoder 2 and the comparator 5. The decoder 2 decodes this VM number and selects the corresponding status register in the status register file 1. If the signal on the signal line ‚Ñì2 is 0 at this time, the reference operation is instructed. The write read control circuit 3 reads out the content of the selected status register in response thereto for the operation register 4, receives the content through the signal line ‚Ñì12 and sends it to the internal data bus ‚Ñì51 through the signal line ‚Ñì1. On the other hand, if the signal on the signal line ‚Ñì2 is 1 , the updating data is given to the signal line ‚Ñì1. The write read control circuit 3 writes this updating data into the selected status register through the signal line ‚Ñì13, and then reads out the updated content to the operation register 4. Next, the operation which reflects the content of the operation register 4 on the common status register 11 is effected, and this reflecting operation is divided into the following two groups depending on the VM number on the signal line ‚Ñì3. More specifically, in the case of 1 , the VM number is 0 and hence the comparator 5 detects coincidence and sends 1 to the signal line ‚Ñì14. In response to this, it selects the signal on the signal line ‚Ñì15, that is, the supervisor mode bit S In the case of 2 , on the other hand, the VM number on the signal line ‚Ñì3 is not 0 . Therefore, the comparator 5 detects discordance and sends 1 to the signal line ‚Ñì17. In response thereto, the selectors 7 and 8 select the outputs of the 0 value generators 9 and 10, respectively, and set them to the supervisor mode bit field 223 and interruption mask level field 222 of the common status register 11. The contents of the corresponding fields of the register 4 are transferred to the other fields of the common status register through the signal line ‚Ñì16. After all, the supervisor mode bit S All the contents of the common status register 11 are transferred to the instruction execution control portion 115 through the signal line ‚Ñì41, and the interruption mask level INT The interruption mask level INT Fig. 9 shows a modified example of the status register control portion 100 shown in Fig. 8. In the drawing, like reference numerals are used to identify like constituents as in Figs. 4 and 8. In this embodiment, VMM has the VM number 0 and receives the allottment of the status register in the status register file 1. In the bare machine mode, however, direct access is made to the common status register 11. For this purpose inhibition gates IGs 13 and 14 are disposed which are controlled by the V bit output of the mode register 12 shown in Fig. 4 between the write read control circuit 3 and the common status register 11, and this construction is different from the embodiment shown in Fig. 8. In the bare machine mode, the V bit of the mode register 12 is 0 , and this turns ON the inhibition gates 13, 14 and is sent to each portion through the signal line ‚Ñì18, thereby inhibiting the access to the status register file 1 and the data transfer from the operation register 4 to the common status register 11. In the reference operation, the content of the common status register 11 passes through the signal line ‚Ñì19 and then through the inhibition gate 13 and is read out to the write read control circuit 3. In the updating operation, the updating data from the internal data bus ‚Ñì51 is directly written into the common status register 11 from the write read control circuit 3 through the signal line ‚Ñì13, the inhibition gate 14 and the signal line ‚Ñì201. During the operation of VMM or VM, the V bit of the mode register 12 is 1 . Therefore, the inhibition gates 13 and 14 are turned off, and the inhibition signal on the signal line ‚Ñì18 disappears. As a result, the circuit becomes equivalent to the circuit shown in Fig. 8, and the reference and updating operations of the status register file 1 corresponding to the VM number and the common status register 11 are effected in the same way as in the circuit shown in Fig. 8. In the circuits shown in Figs. 8 and 9, only the supervisor mode bit S Next, the construction and operation of the interruption control portion of the virtual computer system controller of the present invention will be described. In accordance with the prior art system, when an interruption from an external unit is reported, control is temporarily shifted to VMM. In other words, INT In contrast, the present invention is equipped with a circuit for reducing the processing overhead of VMM. More definitely, the status of a running VM can be directly examined by a control circuit shown in Fig. 10. With reference to Fig. 4, the interruption mask level INT The interruption control portion 110 sets the interruption number to the signal line ‚Ñì20 and the interruption start signal to the signal line ‚Ñì21, respectively, on the basis of the group of the input signals described above if the external interruption can be accepted by the micro processor CPU, and sends the signals to the instruction execution control portion 115. Fig. 10 shows in more detail the interruption control portion 110 shown in Fig. 4. In the drawing, reference numeral 21 represents a selector SEL , and reference numerals 22, 23 and 281 represent comparators. Reference numeral 24 represents the highest priority value generator, which generates a value 7 in this embodiment. Reference numerals 25, 252 and 282 represent AND circuits, 26 and 251 are OR circuits and 283 is a gate circuit. Reference numeral 284 represents an inversion circuit. The status register control portion 100 shown in Fig. 4 sends to the interruption control portion 110 the value of the interruption mask level INT When the value of the V bit is 0 that is, when the value of the signal line ‚Ñì41 is 0 , it represents the operating state of the bare machine and when it is 1 , it represents the operating state of the virtual machine. Incidentally, the value of the V bit is also 0 when VMM is under operation. First of all, the value of the interruption level signal from the external device becomes one of the inputs to the comparator 281 through the line ‚Ñì63. The interruption mask level INT Next, the selector 21 selects the value on the signal line ‚Ñì5, that is, the value of INT The value of the interruption signal at the time of occurrence of the cause for interruption is applied to the other input terminal of the comparator 22 through the gate circuit 283 and the signal line ‚Ñì64. The value of the signal line ‚Ñì64 is applied also to the comparator 23 and the gate circuit 27. The signal line ‚Ñì64 is supplied from outside the LSI chip. The comparator 22 compares the interruption number at the time of the occurrence of the cause of interruption with the value of the interruption mask level. If the value of the interruption signal at the time of the occurrence of the cause for interruption is found to be smaller than the value of the interruption mask level as a result of comparison, the value of the signal line ‚Ñì25 is set to 1 and becomes one of the inputs to the AND circuit 25. If the value of the interruption number is found to be greater than the interruption mask level, it means that the interruption operation start condition is established. Therefore, the value of the signal line ‚Ñì26 is set to 1 , and this value reports the interruption start to the instruction execution control portion 115 shown in Fig. 4 through the OR circuit 26 and the signal line ‚Ñì21. At this time, the interruption number is sent to the instruction execution control portion 115 through the signal line ‚Ñì20. The operation of the comparator 23 is effected in parallel with that of the comparator 22. The comparator 23 checks whether or not the interruption number at the time of the occurrence of the cause for interruption, that is sent through the signal line ‚Ñì64, is the most privileged interruption. The term the most privileged interruption means that the interruption occurs irrespective of the value of the interruption mask level in the status word. Since the signal line group ‚Ñì63 consists of three lines in this embodiment, the most privileged interruption occurs when the value of the interruption number is 7. Therefore, the most privileged sequence value generation circuit 24 generates the value 7. This value is changeable. When the value of the interruption number is found not to coincide with the value of the most privileged sequence as a result of comparison by the comparator 23, the value of the signal line ‚Ñì27 becomes 1 and is one of the inputs to the AND circuit 25. The signal representing the result of comparison by the comparator 22, which is described above, is applied to the other input of the AND circuit 25, and the value of the line ‚Ñì27 is 1 when the interruption number is below the interruption mask level. Therefore, the output signal of the AND circuit 25 is the interruption suspension signal and makes report to the instruction execution control portion 115 through the OR circuit 251 and the signal line ‚Ñì22. If the value of the supervisor mode bit S When the interruption number is found to coincide with the most priviliged sequence value as a result of comparison by the comparator 23, the interruption operation is compulsively started. This is reported to the instruction execution control portion 115 first through the OR circuit 26 via the signal line ‚Ñì28 and then through the signal line ‚Ñì21. Quite naturally, the interruption number, too, is sent through the signal line ‚Ñì20 in the same way as described above. Upon receiving the interruption start instruction through the signal lines ‚Ñì20 ‚Ñì21, the instruction control portion 115 shown in Fig. 4 calculates an entry address corresponding to the interruption number given from the vector table of the running VM, and executes the next instruction of the address value of the vector table entry. Generally, the start address value of the interruption processing program is set to the vector table entry, and the interruption processing is carried out by sequentially executing this instruction group. For details of the interruption processing, refer to the afore mentioned prior art references. The report to the micro program control device called micro program break in in the instruction execution control portion 115 is made by the signal of the line ‚Ñì21. When this signal is received, the interruption operation described above is effected. When the signal of the signal line ‚Ñì22 becomes 1 simultaneously with the change of the signal of the signal line ‚Ñì21 to 1 , the interruption operation is executed by use of the vector table 10 of VMM shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, VMM searches at this time the control block 205 of that VM, and executes the interruption processing program consisting of the processing instruction group storing the interruption data in the interruption list 214. This is necessary in order for VMM to report the interruption operation to that VM and to once store the interruption data when the running VM changes from the supervisor mode S As described above, there is provided the means for automatically comparing and checking the value INT Further, the operational registers such as the address registers and the data registers and the instruction address registers are allotted to each VM, and access to VM can be made immediately by use of the VM identification data. Therefore, the save restore processing of the contents of these registers becomes unnecessary not only when the operating mode of VM and that of VMM are changed over between them but also when VMM executes the change over processing of the running VMs dispatch processing . As a result, the overheads can be drastically reduced because the intervention by VMM is not necessary. Furthermore, since VMM can make access to the registers allotted to an arbitrary VM, the overhead reducing effect described above can be further reduced. Since the instruction for making reference to, or for updating, the status register can be directly processed by hardware, the overhead due to the simulation processing can be eliminated, and the overheads relating to the dispatch processing or to the handling of the status registers in the interruption processing can also be eliminated. Such reduction of the overheads makes it easy to apply VMS particularly to extremely compact computers such as microprocessors. As to the external interruption processing, hardware means is provided which directly compares the external interruption level with the value of the interruption mask level in the status word corresponding to the running VM. As a result, it becomes possible to reduce the overhead of the simulation processing due to the intervention of VMM which is effected whenever the external interruption occurs, and the processing performance of the virtual computer system can be improved.
