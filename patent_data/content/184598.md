This invention also relates to an electron beam curable polyorganosiloxane composition comprising a , b , c , and d as defined above. Detailed Description of the Invention The composition of this invention has a pot life at room temperature which is sufficiently long for practical applications while it is rapidly cured in its interior by ultraviolet or electron beam radiation even under an atmosphere containing oxygen to produce a resin, elastomer, gel, or foam. The alkenyl containing polyorganosiloxane, a , of this invention contains at least two organosiloxane units of the general formula 1 Ra1RbêSiO 4 a b 2 wherein R11 P2, a, and b are defined above. Polyorgano siloxar.e, a8, may contain only these kinds cf organosiloxane units of general formula 1 or it may also additionally contain other kinds of organosiloxane units. At least two organosiloxane units of general formula 1 must be present in each molecule from the standpoint of curability. The molecular configuration of this polyorganosiloxane can be straight chain, branched, cyclic, or network.The degree of polymerization is two or greater while the upper limit is about 10,000 from the standpoint of the usual polymerizability. The alkenyl radical represented by R1 can contain 2 to 4 inclusive carbon atoms which include vinyl, propenyl, and butenyl radicals. Each R2 is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical or halogenated monovalent hydrocarbon radical other than an alkenyl radical. Examples of theRê are alkyl radicals such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and octal aralkyl radicals such as 2 phenylethyl and 2 phenylpropyl halogenated alkyl radicals such as 3 chloropropyl, 3 methyl 3 chloropropyl, 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl aryl radicals such as phenyl and alkaryl radicals such as tolyl. The cited monovalent radicals generally contains 1 to 20 carbon atoms. a is an integer with a value of 1 to 3, b is an integer with a value of C to 2, and a plus b is an integer with a value of three or less. The units in which the combinations of a 1, b 2 , a 1, b 1 and a 1, b 0 appear are the easiest to synthesize. The organosiloxane units other than the organosiloxane unit with general formula 1 can be chosen from siloxane units of the general formulaeR2SiO3 2 unit, the R2êSiO2 2 unit, the R3êSiO1 2 unit, and the SiO4 2 unit. Examples of Rê are the same as cited for the Rê in the units of general formula 1 . The above polysiloxane may contain small amounts of silanol groups and silicon bonded alkoxy groups. Examples of the above mentioned a are dimethylvinylsiloxy terminated polydimethylsiloxane, dimethylallylsiloxy terminated polydimethylsiloxane, phenylmethylvinylsiloxy terminated diphenylsi loxane dimethyl siloxane copolymer, trimethylsiloxy terminated methyl vinylsiloxane dimethylsiloxane copolymer, dlmethylvinyl siloxy terminated dimethylsiloxane methylvinylsiloxane copolymer, vinylpolysilsesquioxane, and copolymers composed of dimethylvinylsiloxane units and SiO4 units. The polyorganohydrogensiloxane, b , necessarily contains organohydrogensiloxane units of the general formula 2 HCRdSio 4 c d 2 wherein R3, c, and d are defined above. The polyorganohydrogensiloxane, b , may contain only organosiloxanes units of general formula 2 or it may also additionally contain other kinds of organosiloxane units. At least two organosiloxane units of general formula 2 must be present in each molecule from the standpoint of curability. The molecular configuration of the polyorganohydrogensiloxane is straight chain, branched, cyclic, or network. The degree of polymerization is two or greater with an arbitrary upper limit however, the upper limit is usually 2,000 from the standpoint of polymerizability.Each R3 is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical and examples of these radicals are described above for Rê. Those monovalent hydrocarbon radicals contain 1 to 20 carbon atoms, c is an integer with a value of 1 to 3, d is an nteger with a value of 0 to 2 and c plus d is three or less. The unIts in which the combinations of c 1, d 2 , c 1, d 1 , or c 1, d 0 appear are the easiest to synthesize. The examples of organosiloxane units other than the organohydrogensiloxane unit of general formula 2 are the same as those in polyorganosiloxane a . The above mentioned polysiloxane may contain small amounts of silanol and silicon bonded alkoxy groups. Examples of b are dimethylhydrogensiloxy terminated dimethylsiloxane methylhydrogensiloxane copolymer, trimethylsiloxy terminated dimethylsiloxane methylhydrogensiloxane copolymer, dimethylphenylsiloxy terminated dimethylsiloxane methylhydrogensiloxane copolymer, and cyclic methylhydrogenpolysiloxanes. Component a can be mixed with component b in any desired ratio however, the quantity of component b is generally determined based on the criterion that 0.2 to 5 moles of silicon bonded hydrogen are present per mol of alkenyl radical in component a . curing is inadequate at less than 0.2 old on a molar basis. On the other hand, when the above quantity exceeds 5 fold on a molar basis, hydrogen gas bubbles are produced and the stability is unsatisfactory. However, when a foamed, cured product is to be produced from the composition, this quantity can exceed 5 fold molar . Component c is a mercapto containing organosilicon compound selected from a mercapto containing polyorganosiloxane I , a mercapto containing silane II , and III mixtures of I and II . The mercapto containing polyorganosiloxane of component c of this invention contains a mercapto group contalning organosiloxane unit of the general formula 3 HSR4 eRfêSiO 4 e f 2 wherein R4, R2, e, and f are defined above. The mercapto containing polyorganosiloxane may contain only organosiloxane units of general formula 3 or it may also additionally contain other kinds of organosiloxane units. The molecular configuration of this organopolysiloxane is straight chain, branched, cyclic, or network. The degree of polymerization must be five or greater in order to avoid the generation of a foul odor. The examples of organic groups which constitute organosiloxane units other than the organomercaptosiloxane unit of general formula 3 are the same as those cited for component a . . The above mentioned polysiloxane may contain small amounts of silanol groups and silicon bonded alkoxy groups in addition to the organic groups. in addition, instead of the above polyorganosiloxane, this invention can employ mercapto containing silane of the general formula 4 HSR4 XeRfSi OR 2 6 g g wherein R41 R , R6, e, f, and g are defined above. EachR4 is a divalent radical selected from diva lent hydrocarbc radicals or halogenated divalent hydrocarbon radIcals. Examples are alkylene radicals such as methylene, ethylene, propylene, and butylene and haloalkylene such as chloroethylene. R6 is the hydrogen atom, methyl, ethyl, propyl, phenyl, and 2 phenylethyl. e is an integer with a value of 1 to 3, f is an integer wlth a value of 0 to 2, g is an integer with a value of 1 to 3 and the sum of e, f and c is 4. Component c exhibits an excellent effect in inhibiting te reaction at room temperature of a composition of this invenL icr. When component c is absent, the pot live is extremely short to the point of impracticality. That Is, component c is a storage stabilizer of the composition of this invention however, its reaction inhibiting effect is inactivated upon ultraviolet or electron beam radiation and it exhibits the effect of accelerating the reaction. Component c should preferably be highly compatible with components a and b in order to exhibit a more satisfactory reaction inhibiting effect.A small quantity of component c will exhibit an adequate effect in terms of reaction inhibition as long as it exhibits excellent compatibility. Also, the foul smell characteristic of the mercapto group will not be generated. The quantity of component c to be added to the composition of this invention is determined under the criterion that it is large enough to provide a practical pot life. This quantity is usually 0.05 to 5 parts by weight per 100 parts of the combined weight of components a and b .However, the quantity of addition may be less than or exceed this range. Examples of component c are gamma mercaptopropylmethylsiloxane dimethylsiloxane copolymer, gamma mercaptoisobutylmethylsiloxane dimethylsiloxane copolymer gamma mercaptcpropylmethylsiloxane me thy lphenyls iloxane copolymer, poly gamma mercapto propylmethylsiloxane, poly gamma mercaptoisobutylmethylsiloxane, gamma mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma mercaptoisobutyltrimethoxysilane, gamma mercapto propylmethyldimethoxysilane, gamma mercaptoisobutylmethyldimethoxysilane, and gamma mercaptoisobutylphenyldimethoxysilane.However, the mercapto containing organosilicon compounds useful in this invention are not limited to the above examples, and includes mixtures, Ti , of I and II . The platinum and platinum type compounds comprising the component d of this invention are the known substances used for the usual hydrosilylation reaction and include extremely finely divided platinum powder, extremely finely divided platinum powder which has been absorbed on a carbon powder support, chloroplatinic acid, alcohol modified chloroplatinic acid, olefin complexes of chloroplatinic acid, chloroplatinic acid vinylsiloxane coordination compounds, platinum black, palladium black, and rhodium catalysts. Among these catalysts, platinum compounds are preferred from the standpoint of curing acceleration. The quantity of component d must be adequate to cure a composition consisting of components a and b and is usually 1 to 1,000 ppm as the platinum group metal based on the combined quantity of components a and b .This quantity obviously can be less than or exceed the above range depending on the catalytic activity. The sensitizer comprising the component e of this invention increases the curing rate of compositions of this invention under ultraviolet radiation, but is not required fqr curing the composition under electron beam radiation. The sensitizer is a known sensitizer which is usually used for ultraviolet curable resins.Examples are aromatic ketones such as acetophenone, benzophenone, trimethysilylated benzophenone, propiophenone, 3 methylacetophenone, 4 methylacetophenone, benzoin ethyl ether, a dimethylpolysiloxane whose two terminals are bonded with benzoin through an ether linkage, 4 isopropyl phenyl 1 hydroxyiscpropyl ketone, 4 allylacetophenone, 3 perttylacetophenone, and 4 methoxybenzophenone amine compounds such as triphenylamine and azobisisobutyronitrile. However, component e is not limited to the above examples. The quantity of the above sensitizer is determined under the criterion that enough is present to photosensitize the composition. This quantity is generally 0.1 to 15 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the combined quantity of components a and b . The above quantity obviously can be less than or exceed the range mentioned above depending on the type of sensitizer used. Fillers and additives can additionally be added in order to increase the mechanical strength or nonflammability of the elastomer produced by curing the composition of this invention. Examples of the fillers and additives are fumed silica, quartz powder, glass fiber, carbon black, alumina, metal oxides such as iron oxide and titanium oxide, and metal carbonates such as calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Appropriate pigments and dyes can be added unless they adversely affect curing. Compositions of this invention can be diluted with a appropriate solvent such as xylene, toluene, oR hexane according to the applicaticn or purpose of the composition. The polyorganosiloxane composition of this invention is stable at room temperature while it is cured even in its interior in a short period of time by ultraviolet or electron beam radiation. On the other hand, compositions consisting of a vinl containing polyorganosiloxane, a polyorganohydrogensiloxane, and a sensitizer to which a small amount of platinum was added exhibit a uniform curing in the interior, but suffer the drawback of extremely pcor storage stability. The product resin, elastomer, gel, or foam rarely smells of mercaptan and can be applied in any application of general curable polyorganosiloxane compositions. This invention will be explained using demonstrationai examples. Parts and n It in the examples denote parts by weight and wt respectively, and the viscosity was measured at 250C.

The results showed that both Sample 9 this invention and Sample 10 Comparison Example 6 exhibited little increase in viscosity in 2 days. Each composition was coated 1.5 g mê on glassine paper and then with a 160 W cm high pressure mercury lamp from a distance of 9 cm. The results showed that Sample 9 this invention was completely cured in 0.3 second whileSample 10 Comparison Example 6 was not completely cured even in 5 seconds although it underwent a significant increase in viscosity.The composition of Sample 9 had a slight smell of mercaptan while its cured product did not smell of mercaptan. Example 5 A dimethylvinylsiloxy terminated dimethylsiloxane methylvinylsiloxane copolymer 100 parts viscosity, 0.5 Pa s vinyl group content, 2.0 was stirred with a tri methylsiloNy term nated polymethylhydrogensiloxane 4 parts viscosity, 0.02 Pa s and gamma mercaptoisobutyl monomethyldimethoxysilane 0.3 part to give a homogeneous solution. The resulting solution was mixed to homogeneity with benzophenone 2 parts and vrnylsiloxane chloroplatinic acid complex 60 ppm platinum based on the total weight to prepare a composition Sample 11 . The viscosity was 0.47 Pa s at this point. A composition Sample 12 was prepared by the same method used to prepare Sample 11 with the exception that benzothenone was not added to the composition. As comparison Example 7, a composition Sample 13 was prepared by the same method used to prepare Sample 11 with the exception that the vinylsiloxane chloroplatinic acid complex was not added to the compositIon. These compositions were allowed to stand at 250C. The results showed the Sample 11, Sample 12 both were examples of this invention and Sample 13 Comparison Example did not undergo an increase in viscosity in 2 days. Each composition 0.7 g m2 was coated on a polypropylene film and then radiated with an electron beam from a curtain type electron beam generator. The results showed that Sample 11 and Sample 12 both were examples of this invention were both completely cured with an electron dose of 2 Mrad whileSample 13 Comparison Example 7 was not completely cured even with 6 Mrad. Both the compositions of Sample 11 andSample 12 smelled slightly of mercaptan while their cured products did not smell of mercaptan. Example 6 A composition Sample 14 was prepared by the method used to prepare Sample 1 of Example 1 with the exception that the 4 isopropylOphenyl 1 hydroxyisopropyl ketone sensitizer was not added to the composition of Sample 1 and this was coated 1.5 g mê on glassine paper and then radiated with an electron beam from a curtain type electron beam generator. The results showed that the composition was completely cured with 3 Mrad. Neither the composition nor cured product smelled of mercaptan.
