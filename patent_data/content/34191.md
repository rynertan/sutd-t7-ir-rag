## Description
Process for preparing thiofunctional polysiloxane polymersThe present invention relates to a process for preparing polysiloxane polymers and more particularly thiofunctional polysiloxane polymers and to the products obtained therefrom.Heretofore, sulfur containing compounds have been prepared by reacting hydroxyl terminated dimethylpolysiloxane fluids with a methoxy containing silacyciopentane thiol in the presence of an acid clay to affect the condensation reaction of the sulfur containing silane and the dimethylpolysiloxane. In the condensation reaction, the acid clay not only catalyzes the condensation between the methoxy groups of the sulfur containing compound and the hydroxyl groups of the dimethylpolysiloxane but also catalyzes the condensation between hydroxyl groups to form a mixture of compounds. Furthermore, the process requires that a preformed hydroxyl terminated dimethylpolysiloxane fluid be prepared prior to the condensation reaction.U.S. Patent 3,346,405 discloses a process for preparing sulfur containing siloxanes by reacting sodium sulfohydride with a chloroalkyl containing organopolysiloxanes in the presence of dimethylformamide. Also, U.S. Patent 2,960,492 discloses a process for preparing sulfur containing organopolysiloxanes by reacting a vinyl containing siloxane with a mercaptan to form an adduct therewith by combining the sulfohydride group with the unsaturated vinyl group of the siloxane. U.S. Patent 3,388,144 discloses reacting a siloxane containg one or two merctoalkyl groups per silicon atom with a polyhydroxylated carbon compound containing an unsaturated olefin group in the presence of a peroxide catalyst.The above described processes for preparing thiofunctional siloxane polymers have several disadvantages. For example, long reaction times are required. Also, siloxanes having chloroalkyl groups or vinyl unsaturation are required as one of the reactants.Moreover, it is very difficult to obtain complete conversion of the chloroalkyl groups or vinyl groups to thiofunctional groups, thus polymers having both functional groups are obtained from the above processes.U.S. Patent 4,046,795 discloses a process for preparing thiofunctional polysiloxane polymers by reacting a disiloxane and or a hydroxy or hydrocarbonoxy containing silane or siloxane with a cyclic trisiloxane in the presence of an acid catalyst, in which at least one of the silanes or siloxanes containing a thiol group.
