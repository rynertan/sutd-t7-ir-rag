# Key card apparatus.

## Abstract
A series of first parallel printed contacts extends inward from a beveled first end of a card. Conductors extend over the surface on ends of the contact and are electrically connected together and with large contact terminals at the ends of the parallel series of contacts. A second parallel series of contacts extends inward from the beveled first edge on the second side of the card, and con ductors are looped around each other and individually termi nate in a triangular array of connectors which extend through the card to make electrical contact with the first conductors on the first surface. Large end contact terminals are provided at ends of the second series of contact. Adhesive backed covers cover the conductors and connectors and inner portions of the contacts and terminals. The first conductors and second conductors are so ar ranged that large sections of each conductor in one group of conductors do not overlie conductors on the opposite side of the card. Holes can be punched through the card in selected locations to selectively interrupt conductors on one side of the card without interrupting conductors on the opposite side of the card.
