# Cleaning device for use with a dip stick.

## Abstract
It is known to use various materials such as rags to clean the dip stick while measuring the oil level of an internal combustion engine. Often this is unsatisfactory as a rag or suitable substitute is not readily available when the checking of the oil level is desired. To alleviate this problem, the cleaning device 1 has means 20 to removably mount the device 1 at a suitable location near the engine. The device 1 has a housing 2 with a U shaped cross section and a layer of absorbent material 10 located on and covering an inner surface 8 of the housing 2 . Part of a dip stick 22 can be laterally inserted into the housing 2 in such a manner that that part 24 is surrounded by absorbent material 10 . The dip stir 22 can then be removed longitudinally to remove the excess oil.
