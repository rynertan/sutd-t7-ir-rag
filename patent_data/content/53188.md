# Heat retaining sheet.

## Abstract
An insulating sheet which contains, as a material, fiber sheet 7 of a small boiling water surface contraction ratio comprising substantially non stretched fibers 4 of finite length containing polybutylene terephthalate at least partly as fiber forming component, with said fibers 4 contacting with each other at mutual contact points 8 to form thin layers 6 and said thin layers 6 being in a laminated scaly structure. This insulating sheet is useful as an insulating material for cottons to be placed within clothes, gloves, hats, beddings, etc.
