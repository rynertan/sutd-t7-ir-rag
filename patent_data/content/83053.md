# METHOD OF INSPECTING AN APERTURED FLAT WORKPIECE AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING THE METHOD

## Abstract
The method of inspecting an apertured plate such as a mask provides an illumination of the plate 12 by a collimated light beam 15 in order to indicate defects or irregularities by a bright spot of light. A modified microfilm reader can be used to project a magnified image 44 of that portion of the plate 12 .
