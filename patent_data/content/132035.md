# A BLENDING AND EMULSIFYING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An apparatus is provided for blending and emulsifying a dry product D with a viscous product V , the latter being disposed to a predetermined level within a tank 21 . The tank 21 is provided with a dry product inlet 22 disposed above the level of the viscous product V . The apparatus includes a power actuated rotary agitator 24 immersed within the visc ous product V and, when rotating at a predetermined speed, causes the viscous product V to form a vortex into which the dry product D is fed through the tank inlet 22 . The agitator 24 is provided with first 27 and second 28 disc members arrranged in spaced, substantially parallel relation. One of the disc members 28 is provided with an enlarged central open ing 35 . The disc members 27, 28 are interconnected to one another by a plurality of symmetrically arranged baffles 30 . The periphery of at least one of the disc members 27, 28 is provided with a plurality of symmetrically arranged shear blades 34 .
