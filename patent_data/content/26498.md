# Improvements to the apparatuses for applying elastomeric fillers to tire bead cores.

## Abstract
Apparatus for automatically applying elastomeric fillers R to tire bead cores C comprising one or more drums 3, 4, 5 for holding the bead core on which the filler is applied when the drum rotates around its axis. The apparatus is provided with means 14 which stretch the filler when it is dragged into rotation with the bead core on the drum so as to produce a stiffening effect which opposes bendings of the filler and therefore maintains the filler substantially in a position in alignment with the drum midline. The apparatus is further provided with means 21 for discharging the bead core filler assembly in a plane unchanged with respect to that determined by the stretching means in order to permit the collection of the various filler bead core assemblies the one after the other.
