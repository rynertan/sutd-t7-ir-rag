# CHARACTERISTIC SWITCHING CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A time constant circuit capable of switching the charac teristic, which is realized by a combination of an equivalent resistor made up of a switched capacitor and an ordinary capacitor, comprises a capacitor 20, 26, 27 of the switched capacitor or the time constant circuit connected in parallel to a series circuit including a switching device 29, 51, 69 and an additional capacitor 28, 47, 52, 56, 58 . The characteristic is switched by turning on and off the additional capacitor by the switching device. The direct connection of a plurality of equivalent resistors with a plurality of switched capacitors and ordinary capacitors makes up an equalizer. The capacitor making up a switched capacitor is connected with a switch ing device and an additional capacitor so that the frequency characteristic of the equalizer is switchable by turning on and off the switching device. Each of the capacitors making up the switched capacitors, the capacitors making up the time constant circuits and the additional capacitors has an end thereof grounded without fail. All the elements are thus cable of being formed in the same integrated circuits.
