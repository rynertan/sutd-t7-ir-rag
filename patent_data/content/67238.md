# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE CONTINUOUS FORMATION OF BIAXIALLY ORIENTED THERMOPLASTIC MATERIALS AND FORMING ARTICLES THEREFROM BY INTERMITTENT FORMING MEANS INTERFACED THEREWITH

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for continuously extruding, biaxially orienting and intermittently forming molded pro ducts from a web of thermoplastic material and further, continuously separating the products from the web selvage, stacking and hanaling the products and recycling the web selvage for further extrusion. The method and apparatus use intermittent molding and biaxial orientation devices into which configuration the continuously extruded web is inter faced by continuous to intermittent interfacing loop arrange ment which preserves the dimensional and orientational integrity of the web and maintains sufficient thermal stability therein to provide molded products which are free from defects such as stretch marks and other inertial and thermal discontinuities normally anticipated in cases of intermittent web advance of thermoplastic material at thermoformable temperature levels.
