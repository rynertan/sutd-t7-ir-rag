# Hydraulically controlled infinitely variable traction roller transmission.

## Abstract
An infinitely variable traction roller transmission with traction rollers 26 arranged between, and in engagement with, opposite toric discs 20, 22 for the transmission of motion therebetween includes traction roller support trun nions 50 pivotally mounted in a transmission housing 10 which has partially cylindrical housing cavities 52 formed behind the trunnions 50 , the trunnions 50 having support cavities 58 receiving pressurized fluid for floatingly sup porting the trunnions 50 on the cylindrical housing cavities 52 to permit friction free pivoting and axial movement of the trunnions 50 for adjustment of the transmission ratio.
