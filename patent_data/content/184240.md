# Plug contact element.

## Abstract
A pierce contact element for a connector with a housing in which the end of a cable with one or more insulated conductors is inserted. The pierce contact has a pointed part intended to pierce into an insulated conductor and a contact crown intended to make contact with the contact strip or contact wire of a matching connector housing. The contact crown is shaped so that its radius of curvature is larger than half the width of the contact crown in order to reduce wear on the surface contacting the strip or wire of the matching connector. In one embodiment, pierce contact is designed so that its pointed part pierces in the longitudinal direction into the end face of the conductor.
