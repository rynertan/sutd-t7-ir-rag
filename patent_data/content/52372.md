## Description
CALIPER HOUSING IN A DISC BRAKE The present invention relates to an improved caliper used in a disc braking system and more particularly, to improvements in structural configuration of the caliper housing for increased performance and service life of the braking system. A generally U shaped caliper or caliper housing for use in a disc brake system comprises a brake actuating hydraulic cylinder portion wherein a fluid actuated piston is slidably received a reaction portion which is positioned opposite to the cylinder portion axially of a disc rotor rotating with a vehicle wheel, so that it. sandwiches, in combination with the opposing cylinder portion, the disc rotor and brake pad assemblies disposed in parallel to, and on opposite sides of, the disc rotor and a connecting portion which extends transversely or along theazis of the disc rotor over the periphery of the rotor and terminates in the reaction portion, thus connecting the cylinder and reaction portions to constitute an integral caliper housing.The caliper is supported by a fixed member of the vehicle in such manner that the former is movable axially of the disc rotor. It is noted in the pertinent art that the maximum permissible diameter of the disc rotor is limited by a specific wall thickness of the connecting portion of the caliper because the disc rotor and the caliper which straddles the rotor are disposed in a relatively limited space formed inside the rim of the vehicle wheel. Thus, it has been a long felt but unsolved need to maximize the diameter of the disc rotor for enhancing the braking performance of a vehicle and More particularly, to thereby increase the operating area of the brake pads for prolonging the required time interval of maintenance of the braking system.It has been conventionally recongnized, on the other hand, that the connecting portion of a disc brake caliper must have a wall thickness more than a certain lower limit approximately 20mm in order to ensure a rigidity enough to avoid the tendency of axially outward deflection of the opposing cylinder and reaction portions or separation thereof away from each other in opposite directions along the axis of the rotor when the piston in the cylinder portion is actuated by pressurized fluid upon brake application. The inventors of the present invention, through continuing and scrupulous research efforts and trial manufacturing activities on a number of calipers of different configurations which were made in view of the above situations in the art, found a surprising fact that the thickness of the connecting portion of the caliper housing can be reduced without the sacrifice of decreasing its rigidity by means of so forming the reaction portion as to include an end wall which extends radially inwardly of the disc rotor from the extremity of the connecting portion. This invention was made based on the above knowledge and discovery. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a disc brake caliper whose connecting portion between cylinder and reaction portions has a reduced wall thickness and thus contributes to increased space under the lower surface thereof for accommodating a disc rotor of an increased diameter, and which still provides enough rigidity to overcome its tendency of outwardly separating deflection of the cylinder and reaction portions away from each other when the piston in the cylinder portion is actuated by pressurized fluid. According to the present invention there is provided a caliper for a vehicle disc brake including a hydraulic cylinder portion within which a piston is slidably received, an reaction portion located in confrontation with the hydraulic cylinder portion, and a connecting portion connecting the hydraulic cylinder and reaction portions at upper ends thereof, the caliper being adapted to be supported by a nonrotatable member of a vehicle so that it is freely movable along the axis of a disc rotor, the caliper being characterized in that the connecting portion has a cross section, taken perpendicularly to the axis of the cylinder portion, which is of substantially circular arc configuration concentric to the disc rotor, and further characterized in that the reaction portion is formed of an arcuate end wall extending radially inwardly of the circular arc from the entire length of extremity of the connecting portion, and of a pair of jaw portions further extending radially inwardly from the end wall. An improved caliper thus constructed according to this invention maintains a high level of rigidity enough to prevent possible deflection thereof otherwise occurring when its connecting portion has a reduced wall thickness. This high rigidity of the caliper is attributed to the formation of an integral reinforcement housing structure or shell structure which is constituted by the connecting portion and the end wall of the reaction portion, as distinguished from conventional types of calipers which generally owe their deflection resisting rigidity to maintenance of a relatively large wall thickness of their connecting portion. Thus, the present invention provides a caliper housing for a disc brake which has a reduced wall thickness but maintains the required rigidity. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be seen by reference to the following description taken in combination with the accompanying drawings. A preferred embodiment of this invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a plan view of a disc brake including a caliper embodying the present invention Figs. 2 and 3 are a front elevation, and a side elevation partly in cross section, of the caliper shown in Fig. 1, respectively Fig. 4 is a plan view of a caliper in another embodiment of this inention and Fig 5 is a front elevation of the caliper shown inFig. 4. Referring first to Fig. 1, there is shown a disc brake of pin sliding caliper type which includes a disc rotor 2 having friction surfaces 4 and 6 on both sides thereof and rotating about its axis together with an axle of a vehicle not shown. Adjacent to the disc rotor 2 is disposed a non rotatable torque member 8 in such manner as to straddle the rotor 2. The torque member 8 which is fixed to the knucle, axle housing or other member of the vehicle, includes planar portions 10 and 12 extending along the friction surfaces 4 and 6 of the disc rotor 2 and a connecting portion 14 which is bridged between the planar portions 10 and 12 axially of the disc rotor 2 and over the periphery thereof to connect the portions 10 and 12.In the central parts of the planar portions 10 and 12, there are formed openings 16 and 18, respectively, within which are movably received an inner and an outer pad assemblies 20 and 22, respectively, with one face thereof facing the respective friction surfaces 4, 6 of the rotor 2. The inner pad assembly 20 consists of a backing plate 24 and a friction member 28, and the outer pad assembly 22 of a backing plate 26 and a friction member 30. On both sides of the opening 16 there are fixed a pair of axially extending parallel pins 38 and 40 to the torque member 8.Each of the pins 38 and 40 includes a sleeve 32 and a bolt 34, 36 inserted therethrough to retain the sleeve 32. On the side opposite to the pins 38 and 40 axially of the disc rotor 2, there is formed an arcuately or chordwise extending rib 42 as an integral part of the planar portion 12, both ends thereof merging into the planar portion 12 at the positions symmetrical, with respect to the rotor 2, to the positions at which the pair of pins 38 and 40 are retained. Referring now to Figs. 2 and 3, there is illustrated a caliper 44 which comprises a hydraulic pressure cylinder portion 46, a reaction portion 48 facing the cylinder portion 46 axially of the disc rotor 2, and a connecting portion 50 extending axially between the cylinder and reaction portions 46 and 48 to connect them at their upper ends as seen in Fig. 3. These three portions 46, 48 and 50 constitute an integral caliper housing structure of virtually saddle like configuration which straddles the disc rotor 2 and the pad assemblies 20 and 22 disposed on both sides of, and in parallel to, the disc rotor 2. In more detail, the cylinder portion 46 has, in a part thereof facing the inner pad assembly 20, a cylinder bore 52 within which a piston 54 is slidably received in a fluid tight manner.Numeral 56 designates a fluid inlet port communicating with the inner chamber of the cylinder bore 52. The connecting portion 50 extends from the upper extremity of the cylinder portion 46 as seen in Fig. 3, forming a substantially cir cblar arc configuration, concentric to the disc rotor 2, in cross section taken along the sides of the disc rotor, i.e., perpendicularly to the axis of the cylinder portion 46 as seen in Fig. 2.The reaction portion 48 includes an arcuate or crescent shaped end wall 58 facing the cylinder portion 46 and extending radially inwardly of the disc rotor 2 from the entire length of the extremity of the connecting portion 50 which is opposite to the extremity of the same terminating in the said upper extremity of the cylinder portion 46, and further includes a pair of jaw portions 60 which are spaced from each other circumferentially of the disc rotor 2 and extended radially inwardly further from the end wall 58.The pair of jaw portions 60 are so formed that their thick ness decreases from the base toward the tip. The end wall 58 is provided, at its radially inward end portion, with a rib 62 which protrudes in the axial direction away from the cylinder portion 46 as seen in Fig. 3, with the amount of protrusion. increasing from its longitudinal end portions toward its central portion as seen in Fig. 1.When assumed that a the width of the connecting portion 50 is W, b the thickness thereof is T, c the depth of the circular arc of the connecting portion is D, and d the distance from the external periphery of the connecting portion 50 to the lower end of the end wall 58 in the middle portion thereof is L, WIT is preferable to be in the invented caliper not less than 11 against the traditional value 4 9, in particular preferable to be in the range of 12 20 D T is preferable to be not less than 1.3 against the traditional value 0.3 0.7, particular desirable range is 1.5 2.5 and L T is preferable to be not less than 1.4 against the traditional value of 1 or less, and a particularly recommendable range of the value is 1.5 2.5. On both sides of the cylinder portion 46 of the thus constructed caliper 44, there are provided a pair of radially spaced arms 66 as seen in Fig. 1, each of which includes at its end a bored boss 64 through which the pin 38, 40 is inserted via a collar 67, whereby the caliper 44 is supported freely movably axially of the disc rotor 2. The pins 38 and 40 are provided at their exposed portions with dusttight boots 70. In operation of the disc brake arranged as described above upon actuation of the piston, the piston 54 of the caliper 44 is forced out by the pressurized fluid toward the inner pad assembly 20 which, in turn, is urged onto the friction surface 4 of the disc rotor 2, and the reaction portion 48 urges by reaction the outer pad assembly 21 onto the friction surface 6. During this actuation of the brake, a moment is applied to the connecting portion 50 ausing the central part to be deflected downwardly inFig. 3.Actually, however, the connecting portion 50 of the caliper 44 of this embodiment which is of circular are configuration in cross section, is protected against such downward deflection by virtue of the structure of the reaction portion 48 which is characterized by the arcuate or crescent shaped end wall 58 extending radially inwardly from the extremity of the connecting portion 50 as well as by the pair of jaw portions 60, an inverted U shaped open ing 68 being defined therebetween such that the extreme bottom is located at a point radially inwardly away from the connecting portion 50. In other words, the end wall 58 and the connecting portion 50 constitute a reinforcement frame structure which ensures a high level of rigidity for preventing the cylinder and reaction portions 46 and 48 from separating from each other axially of the disc rotor 2.Although the end wall 58 itself is also subjected to a force transmitted from the pair of jaw portions 60 in the direction causing the wall 58 to be deflected away from the cylinder portion 46, the wall 58 is not actually so deflected because its rigidity is enhanced by the rib 62. It is thus possible to allow the connecting portion 50 to have a reduced thickness as compared to that of the similar portion of the conventional calipers. According to the experimentation carried out by the inventors, the thickness may be reduced to about a half approximately loom that of the conven tional calipers. This means, it is possible to use a disc rotor which has an increased diameter in proportion to the obtained reduction in wall thickness of the connecting portion 50.Such increase in disc rotor diameter results in an increase in working area of the friction surfaces 4 and 6 and allows the use of larger pad assemblies 20 and 22, whereby the wear life of the brake may be considerably improved. In addition, the reduction in wall thickness of the connecting portion results in reduced weight of the brake. Further, it is noted that these improvements may be readily accomplished within the scope of braking system s components, i.e., without the need of modifications of the wheel rim or other members of the vehicle. While there has been described a preferred embodiment of the invention with a certain particularity, it will be understood that various modifications and changes may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, while the specific embodiment described above refers to a pin sliding caliper type of disc brake, the invention may also apply to other types of disc brake as long as they use a caliper straddling the disc rotor. It is appreciated that the end wall 58, which was in the above embodiment provided with the rib 62 for increasing the rigidity, has been altered by doing away the rib 62 to be progressively increased in the thickness thereof toward its central part in respect of the circumferential direction of the disc rotor 2 for attaining the same effect obtained by the rib 62. Such an end wall 70 is illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5. It is also noted that the connecting portion 71 may have an opening 72 or openings therethrough for ventilation or inspection to the extent that such openings do not reduce the rigidity of the reinforcement frame structure previously indicated. Furthermore, it is possible to give the connecting portion 50 an increased length of arc defining the cross sectional circular arc configuration for the purpose of increasing the rigidity of the reinforcement frame structure.
