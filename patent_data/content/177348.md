# Abrasive tool.

## Abstract
A sanding tool comprises a plurality of saw blades 110, 53 arranged in spaced relation projecting from a planar surface 60 of a rigid plastics supporting member 50,10 a distance of the order of 1 8 inch. The spacing of the blades is very much wider than the width of the blade to provide a self cleaning effect and the plastics member provides a shoulder 15 alongside each of the outermost blades so that the shoulders prevent gouging of the blades.
