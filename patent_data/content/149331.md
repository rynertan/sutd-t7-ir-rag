## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING METHYLENEIMINE COMPOUNDBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for producing a methyleneimine compound, and more particularly to a process for producing a methyleneimine compound by thermal decomposition of 1,3,5 tribenzylhexahydrotriazine, 1,3,5 tris alkylsubstituted benzyl hexahydrotriazine, or 1,3,5 tris 2 hydroxyethyl hexahydrotriazine all of which will be hereinafter referred to merely as hexahydrotriazine compound . The desired compound of the present invention, that is, methyleneimine compound is a compound represented by the general formula CH2 N CH2 R wherein R is phenyl, alkyl substituted phenyl, or hydroxymethyl, and only its presence has been so far confirmed, while its process has not been known.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing a methyleneimine compound by thermal decomposition of a hexahydrotriazine compound as a result of extensive studies of the process so far made by the present inventors. The hexahydrotriazine compound for use in the present invention as a starting material is a compound represented by the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R is phenyl, alkyl substituted phenyl or hydroxymethyl. The alkyl in the alkyl substituted phenyl as R includes, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl, and can include a single alkyl or a plurality of alkyl bonded to one phenyl group. Typical hexahydrotriazine can be exemplified by 1,3,5 tribenzylhexahydrotriazine, 1,3,5tris 3 methylbenzyl hexahydrotriazine, 1,3,5 tris 2 hydroxy ethyl hexahydrotriazine, etc. The thermal decomposition of hexahydrotriazine compound is endothermic, but, if the reaction temperature is too high, side reaction occurs together with the thermal decomposition reaction, thereby lowering the yield of methyleneimine compound, whereas, if too low, the thermal decomposition reaction hardly occurs. Thus, the reaction temperature is preferably 1300 to 2200C, more preferably 1600 to 1900C. The present thermal decomposition reaction can be carried out in much better yield in the presence of a catalyst of an amine salt, a quaternary ammonium salt or a mono to tri valent metal salt of organic acid or inorganic aicd. The catalyst includes, for example, salts of organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, etc. or inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, etc.with amines such as benzylamine, metaxylylenediamine, etc., quaternary ammonium salts of these acids iron chlorides II or III , chromium chlorides II or III , copper chlorides I or II , copper fluorides I or II , magnesium chloride, zinc chloride, etc. It is preferable to use 1 to 100 m moles of the catalyst per mole of the hexahydrotriazine compound. If the amount of the catalyst is too small, no catalytic effect can be obtained, whereas, if too large, the effect has no significant difference, or rather fouling of reaction system or an increased load in washing operation may be brought about. When the catalyst is used, the thermal decomposition reaction temperature can be made lower than that in the absence of the catalyst. In the presence of the catalyst, the reaction temperature is preferably 1000 to 2000C, more preferably 1000 to 1600C. The presence of water in the reaction system promotes polymerization of methyleneimine compound, and thus it is preferable that the starting material hexahydrotriazine compound and the catalyst are free from water of crystallization and absorbed water. The methylenimine compound can be readily separated from the reaction product solution by distillation under reduced pressure. It is also possible to separate the methyleneimine compound by distillation while conducting the thermal decomposition reaction in a vacuum distillation apparatus. The thus obtained methyleneimine compound is a compound having one methylene group at one tertiary nitrogen and is a colorless, transparent liquid of low viscosity at room temperature and having such a property that it can readily undergo polymerization reaction in the atmosphere to produce polymers, and thus can be used in various applications to an instantaneous adhesive or raw material for other chemical products as such, or to a catalyst for various urethane foams, a curing agent and a curing promoter for epoxy resin, a paint stabilizer, a curing agent for rubber latex, a vulcanization promoter, an electrodeprotecting agent, or electro conductive polymers to be obtained by quaternalizing the tertiary nitrogens in the polymers, ion exchange resins, polymeric coagulating agents, etc. as polymers.Furthermore, it can be used as a raw material for preparing other chemical products by utilizing the reactivity of tertiary amino group.PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTIONExample 1 60 g of 1,3,5 tribenzylhexahydrotriazine was charged into a two necked, egg plant type flask with a thermometer in a vacuum distillation apparatus, and the atmosphere in the apparatus was replaced with dry nitrogen.Then, the flask was heated at a vacuum of 3 mmHg and 1600 1800C in a nitrogen gas stream to obtain benzylmethyleneimine as a distillate in a yield of 43 g, which corresponded to 71.7 of the theoretical yield on the basis of 1,3,5 tribenzylhexahydrotriazine.
