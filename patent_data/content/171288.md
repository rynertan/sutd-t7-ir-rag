# METHOD OF MAGNETIC RECORDING

## Abstract
In a magnetic recording method in which, for the pur pose of tracking, a signal having a predetermined frequency is extracted from a reproduced FM recording signal record ed on a magnetic recording medium, and the magnetic head is brought to a position where the amplitude of the signal of predetermined frequency becomes substantially maxim an FM recording signal recorded on a track of the recording medium is reproduced immediately after the recording, when dropout is detected in the recorded signal, a signal having a frequency other than the predetermined frequency is recorded on the same track in a relation superposed on the recorded signal, and the same recording signal as that recorded already on the dropout including track is recorded on another track which may be the next adjacent track again.
