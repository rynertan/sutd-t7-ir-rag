## Description
The present invention relates to processes for producing an alkali metal salt of carboxymethylcellulose ether hereinafter referred to as CMC having a uniform substituent distribution, a high degree of substitution DS 0,5 3,0 and excellent transparency by means of a solvent process. The term CMC is commonly used in the art to mean sodium carboxymethyl cellulose in particular, but in the present context the term CMC includes not only the sodium salt, but also other alkali metal salts, such as the potassium salt. CMC is generally produced by reacting a cellulosic material with an etherifying agent in the presence of an alkali. It is well known to use sodium hydroxide as the alkali and monochloroacetic acid or its alkali salt as the etherifying agent. Processes for the production of CMC may be classified roughly into two groups, i.e., In the production of CMC according to one solvent process, cellulose is first reacted with sodium hydroxide in an aqueous organic solvent to form an alkali salt of cellulose, and the monochloroacetic acid is added to the reaction mixture to carry out the etherification reaction. In another solvent process, sodium monochloroacetate is added to cellulose in an aqueous organic solvent to impregnate the cellulose with sodium monochloroacetate, and then sodium hydroxide is added thereto to carry out the etherification reaction. In both process, the molar ratio of alkali etherifying agent in the etherification reaction system is given by the formula This ratio is at least 1.0 and is generally maintained at about 1.10, the optimum alkali etherifying agent molar ratio range being 1.0 1.30. This range was selected because, if this molar ratio is above 1.30, a side reaction of sodium monochloroacetate as shown in the following reaction 1 is likely to occur so as to reduce the available content of expensive sodium monochloroacetate, and such a result is economically disadvantageous. On the other hand, if this molar ratio is less than 1.0, glycolic acid is formed by a side reaction according to the following reaction 2 when the alkali in the reaction system has been consumed, thereby making the reaction system acidic. The glycolic acid attacks the carboxyl groups of the CMC, thereby converting part of the CMC into its free acid form and thereby seriously reducing the solubility of the resulting CMC Therefore, in the production of CMC, the alkali etherifying agent molar ratio is generally regulated to be about 1.10 so that the etherification reaction is carried out in the presence of an excess amount of the alkali and, after completion of the reaction, the excess alkali is neutralized with, for example, acetic acid, whereby to obtain CMC. Upon investigation, the present inventors surprisingly have found that CMC having a uniform substituent distribution and an excellent transparency can be obtained, with a monochloroacetic acid availability far higher than that of conventional processes, by a process comprising reacting a cellulosic material with an etherifying agent, in the presence of an alkali, in an aqueous organic solvent, to form an alkali salt of carboxymethylcellulose ether, wherein the etherification reaction is initiated in the presence of an excess amount of the etherifying agent such that the molar ratio of alkalietherifying agent in the reaction system, namely, According to the present invention the molar ratio of alkaliletherifying agent in the initial stage of the etherification reaction is regulated to be within the range of 0.10 to 0.70, preferably 0.30 to 0.70, lower than the usual range of 1.0 to 1.30 employed in the conventional processes, such that the reaction in the initial stage is carried out in the presence of an excess amount of the etherifying agent. Consequently, the above mentioned side reaction 1 is controlled and the availability of monochloroacetic acid is kept high. In the reaction of preparing CMC, the diffusion or penetration into the cellulose of sodium monochloroacetate, which has a lower compatibility with cellulose than that of the alkali, is considered to be a rate controlling step. Therefore, if the etherification reaction of preparing CMC is carried out, in the presence of an excess amount of an alkali, at a temperature of as high as 60 to 80 C, as in the conventional processes, the etherification is completed by the excess amount of the alkali before the sodium monochloroacetate is uniformly diffused or penetrated into the cellulose fibers, resulting in a non uniform substituent distribution in the obtained CMC. However, if the etherification is initiated and carried out to some extent in the presence of an excess amount of sodium monochloroacetate, according to the present invention, diffusion or penetration of the sodium monochloroacetate into the cellulose fibers is promoted and reaction with a small amount of the alkali, which has penetrated into the fiber, is effected to obtain CMC having a uniform substituent distribution. It is necessary in the present invention to initiate the reaction in the presence of an excess amount of the etherifying agent, i.e. that the reaction be carried out in the above mentioned 0.10 to 0.70 molar ratio range for at least 30 of the etherification reaction time period. Subject matter of the present invention is a process for preparing an alkali metal salt of carboxymethylcellulose ether, which comprises reacting cellulose, in the presence of an alkali in an aqueous organic solvent, with an etherifying agent effective to etherify said cellulose to form carboxymethylcellulose ether and then recovering said alkali metal salt of carboxymethylcellulose ether from the reaction mixture, which is characterized in that the etherification reaction is carried out in two steps at 60 to 80 C, wherein in the first step the entire amount of said etherifying agent is present in the reaction mixture and the molar ratio of said alkali said etherifying agent equal to As the reaction solvent used in the process of the present invention, there can be mentioned aqueous organic solvents such as ethyl alcohol, n propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol hereinafter referred to as PA , n butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, tert butyl alcohol or acetone, as well as aqueous organic solvent mixtures such as ethyl alcohol benzene, ethyl alcohol toluene or ethyl alcohol n hexane. As the alkali, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide is suitably used. As the etherifying agent, there can be used monochloroacetic acid, sodium monochloroacetate, potassium monochloroacetate or an ester of monochloroacetic acid such as ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl or tertbutyl monochloroacetate. The degree of substitution hereinafter referred to as DS of the CMC produced by the process of the present invention is variable within the range of 0.5 to 3.0. The process of the invention is particularly advantageous in the pmduction of CMC having a DS in the range of 0.8 to 2.0 which is substantially equal to that of commercially available CMC prepared using a large amount of the alkali. CMC produced by the process of the present invention contains the substituents uniformly introduced therein. Therefore, as compared with CMC produced by the conventional processes, it contains smaller amounts of 1 insoluble matter and 2 large, partially dissolved, swollen gel, and therefore it has a higher transparency. When CMC obtained according to the present invention is used as an ingredient of printing paste, clogging of the screen is reduced. Further, CMC thus obtained has an excellent resistance to putrefaction. which is very important practical physical property for CMC to be used for drilling engineering works, oil well drilling, production of drinks fermented with lactic acid bacteria, tooth pastes, printing pastes, liquid pastes and fiber wall materials. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention said molar ratio in the first reaction step is in the range of from 0.30 to 0.70, and said molar ratio in the second reaction step is in the range of 1.00 to 1.50, preferably 1.0 to 1.3. The inventors have further found that CMC having an average degree of substitution DS of as high as 0.9 to 3.0, preferably 2.0 to 3.0, can be obtained by a process, with a high monochloroacetic acid availability, comprising reacting a cellulosic material with an etherifying agent, in the presence of an alkali, in an aqueous organic solvent, to form an alkali salt of a carboxymethylcellulose ether, which process comprises two sequential reaction steps and the etherification is conducted at 60 to 80 C, which comprises in the first reaction step of the first reaction sequence. reacting cellulose, in the presence of an alkali in an aqueous organic solvent, with an etherifying agent effective to etherify said cellulose to form carboxymethylcellulose ether having an average degree of substitution in the range of from 0.8 to 2.2, wherein the entire amount of said etherifying agent used in the first reaction step is present in the reaction mixture during the first reaction step and the molar ratio of said alkalilsaid etherifying agent equal to Accordino to this second embodiment of the present invention, CMC having a DS as high as at least 2.00. preferably 2.0 to 3.0, particularly at least 2.50, can be produced using a two reaction sequence process, with a high availability of monochloroacetic acid, by controlling the side reaction 1 by reducing the amount of the alkali in the reaction system by maintaining the molar ratio of alkali etherifying agent in the initial stages of the first and second reaction sequences in the range of 0.10 to 0.70, preferably 0.30 to 0.70. The reaction conditions, in particular the materials usable as the alkali, cellulosic material, etherifying agent and aqueous organic solvent are the same as in the first embodiment of the invention. It is necessary to initiate the reaction in the presence of an excess amount of the etherifying agent in the initial stages of both of the first and second reaction sequences. It is necessary that the initial stages or both reaction sequences be carried out in the above mentioned molar ratio range of 0.10 to 0.70, for at least 30 of the total etherification reaction period in each reaction sequence. In the production of CMC by the process of the second embodiment of the invention, the reaction in the second reaction sequence to be carried out after completion of the reaction in the first reaction sequence, can be effected by a method wherein the excess alkali contained in the reaction mixture is neutralized with, for example, acetic acid after completion of the etherification reaction in the first reaction sequence. The mixture is then washed with an aqueous alcohol solution, preferably with a 75 aqueous methanol solution to remove by products, such as common salt, sodium glycolate and sodium acetate, and the residue is dried and subjected to the reaction in the second reaction sequence. Alternatively, a method wherein the etherification reaction mixture from the first reaction sequence is cooled to a given temperature and subjected directly to the reaction of the second reaction sequence can be employed. The degree of substitution DS of CMC produced by the two reaction sequence process of the present invention varies in the range of 0.9 to 3.0. This two reaction sequence process is particularly advantageous in the production of CMC having a DS of higher than 2.0, particularly higher than about 2.5, because the production of CMC having such a high DS has been difficult to attain with conventional one step processes. CMC produced on a commercial scale by the process of the second embodiment of the present invention has a DS of higher than 2.00, particularly higher than 2.5. Therefore, as compared with CMC having a DS of less than 2.00 produced on a commercial scale by the conventional processes, it has higher water solubility, and aqueous solutions thereof have a higher resistance to chemicals. Therefore, CMC of the invention is preferable for use as an assistant in the production of printing pastes, in drilling engineering works, oil well drilling, as an additive for drinks fermented with lactic acid bacteria or for tooth pastes. In addition, it will be possible to use the CMC of the invention as a reactive, high molecular weight intermediate for other derivatives in other fields. According to the invention, the etherification reaction is conducted at 60 to 80 C, for 5 to 320 minutes, preferably 30 to 90 minutes. A weight ratio of isopropanol to water is 1 1 to 30 1, preferably 4 1 to 20 1. A weight ratio of the solvent mixture to cellulose is 2 1 to 50 1, preferably 3 1 to 30 1. It is preferred that the first stage is ended when 90 to 99 wt. of NaOH has been used, and the second stage is ended when 100 of the etherifying agent has been used. According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention CMC is prepared using a process which comprises in a first reaction step, dissolving a water soluble alkali in a solvent mixture of isopropanol and water in which the weight ratio of isopropanol water is from 1 1 to 30 1, adding cellulose to said solvent mixture in such an amount that the weight ratio of said solvent mixture said cellulose is from 2 1 to 50 1 to form a slurry, then adding monochloroacetic acid to said slurry so that the molar ratio of said alkali said monochloroacetic acid equal to A further preferred two reaction sequence process for preparing an alkali metal salt of carboxymethylcellulose wherein each reaction sequence comprises two sequential reaction steps, comprises in the first reaction step of the first reaction sequence, dissolving a watersoluble alkali in a first solvent mixture of isopropanol and water in which the weight ratio of isopropanol water is from 1 1 to 30 1, adding cellulose to said first solvent mixture containing said alkali in such an amount that the weight ratio of said first solvent mixture said cellulose is from 2 1 to 50 1 to form a first slurry, then adding monochloroacetic acid to said slurry so that the molar ratio of said alkali said monochloroacetic acid equal to then in the first step of the second reaction sequence, adding said alkali metal salt of carboxymethylcellulose ether having a degree of substitution of from 0.8 to 2.2 obtained in said first reaction sequence to a second solvent mixture containing said alkali having the same range of the same components as said first solvent mixture, then adding monochloroacetic acid thereto to form a second reaction mixture in which said molar ratio of said alkali said monochloroacetic acid in said second reaction mixture is in the range of from 0.30 to 0.70, then heating said second reaction mixture to a temperature in the range of from 60 to 80 C for 5 to 320 minutes to further increase the degree of substitution of said alkali metal salt of carboxymethylcellulose then in the second step of said second reaction sequence adding an additional quantity of said alkali in one or more portions to the second reaction mixture, without adding more of said monochloroacetic acid until said molar ratio of said alkali said monochloroacetic acid is in the range of from 1.00 to 1.50, then heating the second reaction mixture to a temperature in the range of from 60 to 80 C for 5 to 320 minutes to obtain an alkali metal salt of carboxymethylcellulose having a degree of substitution higher than that of the alkali metal salt of carboxymethylcellulose obtained at the end of said first reaction sequence and in the range of from 2.0 to 3.0 and then recovering said latter salt of carboxymethylcellulose from the second reaction mixture. The following examples and comparative examples will further illustrate the present invention in connection with the drawing which is a graph showing the properties of CMC obtained in the Examples and Comparative Examples. The following properties of the resulting CMC, obtained by the process of the invention, were measured or determined as described below 1 g of CMC was weighed accurately and incinerated in a platinum or porcelain crucible at 600 C. Sodium oxide formed by the incineration was titrated with N 10 sulfuric acid using phenolphthalein as an indicator. From the amount A ml of the titrant added, DS was calculated according to the formula The transparency of a 1 wt. aqueous CMC solution irradiated with a given light source is determined by the height of a liquid column. This is a method conventionally employed in the art. If the reaction is heterogeneous, the transparency is reduced by the unreacted cellulose, undissolved matter, swollen gel, etc. The higher the homogeneity of the reaction is, the higher the transparency will be. 3 Amount of glucose formed by hydrolysis with cellulase uniformity of substituent distribution The substituent distribution of CMC includes 1 the distribution of hydroxyl groups in 2 , 3 and 6 positions in the anhydroglucose unit, 2 intramolecular distribution and 3 intermolecular distribution. It is considered that these three types of substituent distributions are closely related to the physical properties of CMC. Further, the intramolecular and intermolecular substituent distributions supposedly exert a great influence on the amount and size of the undissolved matter and the semi dissolved, swollen gel, and the resistance to putrefaction, both of which are important practical physical properties. The uniformity of the substituent distribution in the present invention was determined by adding 5 mg g CMC of a cellulase cellulase AP a product of Amano Seiyaku Co., Ltd. to a 1 aqueous CMC solution to hydrolyze the CMC at room temperature for 140 145 hours, the hydrolysis being substantially complete in about 140 hours. Glucose formed by the hydrolysis was determined according to the glucose oxidase method, as described by M. G. Wirick et al. J. Poly. Sci., Part A 1, vol. 6, 1965 1968 , which discloses that a CMC molecule having a chain of at least 3 unsubstituted anhydroglucose units is hydrolyzed in the presence of a cellulase a hydrolase for cellulose . The smaller the amount of glucose formed, the higher is the uniformity of the substituent distribution. The subsituent distribution measured herein includes both intramolecular and intermolecular distributions. The amount of glucose formed is represented by the number of glucose molecules per 1000 anhydroglucose units in the CMC number 1000 AGU . It is considered that CMC is putrefied mainly due to the hydrolysis by celulase produced by microorganisms. The resistance to putrefaction was determined from a viscosity ratio before and after the hydrolysis, using a 1 aqueous solution with cellulase as in 3 , according to the formula The higher the viscosity ratio is, the higher is the resistance to putrefaction. The viscosity was measured by means of a Brookfield L type viscometer rotor Nos. 1 4 at 60 rpm at 25 C. Availability of monochloroacetic acid AM was determined according to the formula A 1 solution of 2.5 g of CMC was prepared in a cylindrical glass vessel having a diameter of 55 mm and a depth of 125 mm. The temperature was maintained at 25 C. After rotation at a rotor speed of 60 rpm for 1 minute, the viscosity was measured with a Brookfield L type viscometer. By multiplying the resulting value by a given constant, the viscosity cP was determined. The following examples do not limit the present invention.

Then, a solution of 125.0 parts of monochloroacetic acid in 125.0 parts of IPA was added thereto in portions and the mixture was stirred at 20 to 30 C for 30 minutes. Thereafter, the temperature was elevated to 70 C over about 15 minutes and the etherification reaction was carried out at 70 C for 60 minutes.

After washing and drying in the same manner as described in Example 10, CMC was obtained according to a conventional process. The same procedure as in Comparative Example 6 was repeated except that the amounts of IPA, water, sodium hydroxide and monochloroacetic acid were altered as shown in Table 2 to complete the reaction in the first and the second steps. In Comparative Example 10, a third step reaction, the same as the second step reaction, was carried out on the second step reaction product and the product was purified in the same manner as in the second step. In Comparative Example 11, a further fourth step reaction, the same as the third step reaction, was carried out using the third step product as the starting material. Thus, CMC was obtained by conventional processes. It is apparent from Table 2 that, as compared with the conventional processes, the process of the present invention for the production of CMC having a high degree of substitution exhibits a far higher availability of monochloroacetic acid, which is an expensive etherifying agent. According to the process of the present invention, CMC having a degree of substitution of as high as above 2.00, particularly above 2.50, can be produced by the two reaction sequence process, whereas this compound has been produced by three to five step processes in the prior art. According to the process of the invention, the production of CMC having such a high degree of substitution on an industrial scale is made possible.
