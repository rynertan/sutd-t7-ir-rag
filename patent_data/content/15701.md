# Heat sealable packaging film of a polyacrylonitrile substrate coated with a vinylidene chloride copolymer.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to improved coated film products comprising essentially a film substrate having a dry continuous adherent coating thereon formed from certain col loidally stable polymer latexes. In particular, such polymers comprise vinylidene chloride multipolymers with a relatively low pH from 0.90 up to 0.95 which are coated upon the sur face of an oriented polyacrylonitrile film which has been corona discharge treated prior to coating. Such coated film products exhibit improved resistance to seal strength deterioration or complete failure when the coated film products, after having been sealed, are immersed in water at room temperature or above including boiling water.
