# A rock breaker.

## Abstract
A rock breaker comprising a tool insertable in a hole in a rock and fed through a supply line 52 with an incompressible liquid to maintain a column of the liquid in the hole, and means 60,61 to apply to the liquid a shock means sufficiently high to fracture the rock. The tool comprises a hollow stem having an expansible collet 5 to lock the tool in a hole and a resilient sealing member 15 to form a liquid seal for the tool in the hole. In order to provide a simple arrangement which can readily be locked in and released from the hole, the tool has a sleeve 14,16 which is forced axially along the hollow stem of the tool to act on the sealing member 15 and collet 5 by a nut 11 screwed on to the upper end of the stem and bearing on the upper end of the sleeve 14 . The nut is turned by a handle 10 acting on the nut through a ratchet to force the sleeve downwardly and thereby expand the collet and sealing member.
