# Method and apparatus for separating tobacco mixture into lighter and heavier fractions.

## Abstract
A tobacco leaf mixture 31 containing lighter and heavier fractions is fed into one side of a housing 12 while an airstream flow 32 is introduced at the other side of the housing and in an upwardly directed flow course so as to cause it to entrain the lighter fraction 39 of the mixture therein, with the heavier fraction 40 falling to the bottom of the housing. A suction lift is maintained at the top of the housing to increase the velocity of the lighter fraction containing air flow outwardly from the housing. The lighter fraction containing air flow is then delivered to a tangential separator unit 26 to recover the light fraction. The lighter fraction can, for example, be the laminae material from which shredded cigarette tobacco filler is made.
