## Description
6 AMINOAbKYLPENICILL,ANIC ACID 1,1 DIOXIDES AND DERIVATIVES AS BETA LACTAMASE INHIBITORS The present invention relates to 6 alpha and 6 beta aminomethyl and l aminoethyl penicillanic acid l,l dioxides, said aminomethyl compounds optionally substituted on amino nitrogen with benzyl, hydroxybenzyl, picolyl or phenethyl, pharmaceutically accept able salts thereof and conventional esters thereof which are hydrolyzable in vivo bis methanediol esters thereof or mixed methanediol esters with said betalactamase inhibitors and sulbactam penicillanic acid l,l dioxide , said methanediol esters also hydrolyzable in vivo.While some of these compounds possess antibacterial activity per se, their principal value is as beta lactamase inhibitors. Thus they are useful in combination with conventional beta lactam antibiotics penicillins and cephalosporins against microorganisms resistant or partially resistant to beta lactam antibiotics through production of beta lactamase enzymes. Also encompassed by the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a present beta lactamase inhibiting compound and a known betalactam antibiotic bis methanediol esters of the present beta lactamase inhibiting compounds with either ampicillin or amoxicillin pharmaceutical compositions of said bis esters methods of treating bacterial infections with either of the above pharmaceutical compositions and compounds useful as intermediates in the preparation of these compounds. Related compounds, viz, penicillanic acid 1,1dioxide and esters thereof readily hydrolyzable in vivo Barth, U.S. Patent 4,234,579 the bis methanediol ester of sulbactam Bigham, U.S. Patent 4,309,347 various 6 beta hydroxymethyl penicillanic acid 1,1dioxides and esters thereof Kellogg, U.S. Patent 4,287,181 and 6 beta aminomethyl penicillanic acid McCombie, U.S Patent 4,237,051 have been previously described as beta lactamase inhibitors useful in combination with beta lactam antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections. Antibacterial bisesters of methanediol with penicillins and penicillanic acid l,l dioxide Bigham, U.S. Patent 4,244,951 Godtfredsen et al., U.S. Patent 4,342,772 have also been described. U.K. Patent Application 2,053,220, publishedFebruary 4, 1981, broadly discloses beta lactamase inhibiting compounds of the formulaEMI2.1 The definitions of R , Rb and Rc define literally an infinite number of compounds. These definitions, by appropriate selection of Ra, Rb and Rc, may possibly define the simple 6 alpha and 6 beta aminoalkyl penicillanic acid l,l dioxides of the present invention.No specific method for preparation of these compounds is present in the disclosure of this U.K. application, and there is no hint or suggestion that from among the infinity of compounds proposed, the present aminomethyl and l aminoethyl compounds are preferred compounds, possessing the particularly highly potent beta lactamase inhibitory activity which we have determined for them. The present invention relates to compounds of the formulaeEMI3.1 andEMI3.2 wherein in a first alternative R is hydrogen n is 1 Q is benzyl, o , m or p hydroxybenzyl, phenethyl, or 2 , 3 or 4 picolyl and R1 is hydrogen, or a radical group forming an ester which is hydrolyzable under physiological conditions in a second alternative Q is hydrogen R is hydrogen or methyl and n is 1 and R1 is hydrogen, a a radical group forming an ester hydrolyzable under physiological conditions, or 1,l dioxopenicillanoyloxymethyl or n is 2 and R1 is CU2 the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable cationic salts thereof when R1 is hydrogen. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that when R is methyl, each of the formulae I and II represent two different diastereoisomers epimers . Depending on absolute stereochemistry, the side chains of these epimeric pairs are designated lR aminoethyl and lS aminoethyl. In each case one epimer has side chain configuration R and the other S. The same is true with respect to the formulae III and IV , V and VI , and VII and VIII below. These isomer pairs are generally separable by column chromatography at a variety of stages in the overall processes which are detailed below. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include, but are not limited to, those with hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid,. 2 naphthalenesulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid. Pharmaceuticallyacceptable cationic salts include, but are not limited to, those of sodium, potassium, calcium, N,N dibenzylethylenediamine, N methylglucamine meglumine and diethanolamine. The reference to esters which are hydrolyzable under physiological conditions refers to those esters frequently referred to as pro drugs . Such esters are now as well known and common in the penicillin art as pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such esters are generally used to enhance oral absorption, but in any event are readily hydrolyzed in vivo to the parent acid. Preferred esters show no tendency to hydrogenolyze under the conditions preferably employed for their preparation see below . The more preferred ester forming radicals are gamma butyrolacton 4 yl, CHR2OCOR3, and CHR2OCOOR3, wherein R2 is hydrogen or methyl and R3 is Cl C6 alkyl. The most preferred radicals are pivaloyloxymethyl and I ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl. When n is 1 and R1 is l,l dioxopenicillanoyloxymethyl,EMI5.1 the compounds of the formulae I and II are diesters of methanediol. Such esters are also hydrolyzable under physiological conditions, yielding the parent acid of the formula I or II , wherein n is 1 and R1 is H, and penicillanic acid l,l dioxide. The latter compound also possesses beta lactamase inhibitory activity. When n is 2 and R1 is CH2 , the bis ester is likewise hydrolyzed under physiological conditions, now producing two molecules of the parent acid from each molecule of the bis ester. Both the 6 beta compounds I and the 6 alphacompounds II , regardless of side chain stereochemistry when R is methyl, are potent beta lactamase inhibitors.For oral use, it is preferred that R1 is other than hydrogen. When R1 is a radical group forming an ester hydrolyzed in vivo, the preferred radicals are defined above. Because it is readily prepared in a highly pure, crystalline state directly useful in mammals as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt pivaloyloxymethyl 6 alpha aminomethyl penicillanate l,l dioxide toluenesulfonate salt is a particularly valuable compound in this series. Also readily prepared and of special value for oral use are the 6 alpha aminomethyl derivatives II wherein n is 1 and R1 is l,l dioxopenicillanoyloxymethyl or n is 2 and R1 is CH2 . Both the 6 beta compounds I and the 6 alphacompounds II , regardless of side chain stereochemistry when R is methyl, are potent beta lactamase inhibitors. The compounds of the formulae I and II are useful as inhibitors of beta lactamase enzymes. By this mechanism, these compounds enhance the activity of beta lactam antibiotics penicillins and cephalosporins , particularly against those microorganisms which are resistant or partially resistant to the beta lactam antibiotic through the production of enzymes beta lactamases which would otherwise destroy or partially destroy the beta lactam antibiotic. In this manner, the spectrum of activity of the beta lactam antibiotic is increased. The beta lactam antibiotics are one of the most well known and widely used class of antibacterial agents. These compounds are characterized by a nucleus consisting of a 2 azetidinone beta lactam ring fused to either a thiazolidine or a dihydro 1,3thiazine ring. When the nucleus contains a thiazolidine ring, the compounds are usually referred to generically as penicillins, whereas when the nucleus contains a dihydrothiazine ring, the compounds are referred to as cephalosporins.While the present compounds are effective in enhancing the activity of beta lactam antibiotics in general, their preferred use is found in their combination with a penicillin or cephalosporin of established clinical utility, viz., amoxicillin, ampicillin, azlocillin, bacampicillin, carbenicillin, carbenicillin indanyl, carbenicillin phenyl, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefaloram, cefamandole, cefamandole nafate, cefaparole, cefatrizine, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefmenoxime, cefodizime, cefoperazone, ceforanide, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cephacetrile, cephalexin, cephaloglycin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cephradine, cyclacillin, penicillin, hetacillin, levopropylcillin, mecillinam, mezlocillin, penicillin G, penicillin V, phenethicillin, piperacillin, pirbenicillin, pivampicillin, sarmoxicillin, sarpicillin, suncillin, talampicillin and ticarcillin, including the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The names employed for these beta lactams are generallyUSAN, i.e., United States Adopted Names. Preferred combinations are with ampicillin or an ampicillin derivative, with amoxicillin or an amoxicillin derivative or, most particularly, with cefoperazone. Although the compounds of the present invention can be administered separately from the beta lactam antibiotic, combination dosage forms are preferred.The pharmaceutical composition, whether for oral or parenteral use, comprises in a ratio of 1 3 to 3 1 by weight a beta lactamase inhibitor of the formula I or II and a beta lactam antibiotic, in total amounts sufficient to successfully treat a bacterial infection in a mammal in a single or, more usually, multiple doses. Also encompassed by the present invention are antibacterial compounds having the stereochemical formulaeEMI8.1 andEMI8.2 wherein R is hydrogen or methyl, and R4 isEMI8.3 wherein Y is hydrogen, hydroxy, C2 C7 alkanoyloxy, C2 C7 alkoxyearbonyloxy, benzoyloxy, or benzoyloxy monosubstituted with Cl C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy or halo and the pharmaceutically acceptable mono and diacid addition salts thereof, the acids being as described above. These bis methanediol esters III and IV are effective as antibacterials through their in vivo hydrolysis to the corresponding beta lactamase inhibitors of the formulae I and II and to the corresponding ampicillin, amoxicillin or amoxicillin substituted on phenolic oxygen. It will be further noted that such phenolic esters are also generally hydrolyzed in vivo to produce amoxicillin. The bis methanediol ester compounds are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions, suitable for either parenteral or oral administration in single or more usually multiple dosage for the treatment of bacterial infections in mammals. Preferred compounds of the formulae III and IV have Y as hydrogen or hydroxy most preferred compounds have Y as hydrogen. Further encompassed by the present invention are intermediates of the stereochemical formulaeEMI9.1 wherein AEMI9.2 or S and R is hydrogen or methyl EMI10.1 wherein Y is benzyloxycarbonyl amino amino azido or trifluoromethanesul fonyloxy and R is hydrogen or methyl. Those compounds of the present invention of the formulae I and II are generally prepared from benzyl 6,6 dibromopenicillanate or from benzyl 6 alpha iodopenicil lanate. A preferred route, particularly for the 6 beta aminomethyl series, involves as a first stage conversion of the dibromo compound to an epimeric mixture of mono Grignard reagents. This is conveniently done by an exchange reaction using essentially one molar equivalent of methyl magnesium bromide in an ether solvent ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane at low temperature 500 to 100 C , conveniently at 780C, the temperature of an acetone dry ice bath. After a brief reaction time 5 30 minutes at such reduced temperature, the mono Grignard reagents are contacted with essentially 0.5 molar equivalents of benzyloxycarboxamidomethyl acetate usually diluted with the same ether solvent and added to the coldGrignard reagent at such a rate that the low temperature of the reaction is maintained .Reaction time is not critical 0.5 to 2 hours at 50 to 1000C is usually sufficient to achieve complete reaction.Mixed epimers of the above formulae VII and VIII wherein Y is benzyloxycarbonylamino are readily recovered by acetic acid quench, concentration and chromatography. The mixture of epimers can be used directly in the next step, or if desired, separated by further column chromatography on silica gel. The next step of the sequence is reductive removal of the bromine atom, conveniently accomplished by the action of excess tri n butyltin hydride, optionally in the presence of small amounts less than 0.1 molar equivalents of a free radical initiator such as 2,21 azobisisobutyronitrile AIBN . Here and hereinafter, reaction inert solvent is defined as a solvent which does not react with starting materials, reagents, intermediates or products in a manner which significantly reduces the yield of the desired product. Well suited in the present case are hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene or toluene. Temperature should be elevated 60 1000C , such that reaction occurs in a reasonable time, but not so high as to cause undue thermal degradation. When this step is carried out on the mixed epimer precursors, the 6beta epimer V , wherein A is S, is generally recovered by crystallization if desired the 6 alpha epiner VI, A S is recovered from the mother liquors by evaporation and chromatography. A second preferred route, particularly for the 6alpha aminomethyl series, is to react a cold ether solution of the Grignard reagent from benzyl 6 alpha iodopenicil lanate with a benzyloxycarboxamidomethyl acetate under conditions described above. The resulting mixture of compounds V and VI , wherein A is S, can be separated by column chromatography, but preferably are oxidized to l,l dioxides and then subjected to C 6 epimerization conditions to yield the clean alpha epimer VI, A SO2 as detailed below. To form the 1 alpha and l beta oxides of the formulae V and VI , wherein A is S O or SO, the above sulfides of the formulae V and VI , wherein A is S, are oxidized with substantially 1 molar equivalent of a peracid, conveniently m chloroperbenzoic acid, in a reaction inert solvent such as ethyl acetate at 0 50 C. When benzyl 6 beta benzyloxycarbonylamino methyl penicillanate V, R H, A S is oxidized, the resulting alpha oxide V, R H, A S O is isolated by crystallization, while the beta oxide V,R H, A S O is isolated from mother liquors by evaporation. If desired, other standard sulfoxide forming reagents can be used. If desired, benzyl 6 beta benzyloxycarbonylaminomethyl penicillanate l beta oxide V, A S O is rearranged to the corresponding 6 alpha epimer VI,A S O by contacting the former with an equivalent of 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.0 non 5 ene DBN at 0 500C, conveniently at 250 where reaction is complete in a very short time 3 15 minutes . In like manner a 6beta dioxide V, A SO2 is converted to its 6 alpha epimer VI, A SO2 . Oxidation of the sulfides V and VI , wherein A is S, or further oxidation of the above sulfoxides, with excess peracid but otherwise under conditions as generally described above for mono oxide formation yields the corresponding sulfones l,l dioxides of the formulae V and VI , wherein A is SO2. If desired, other sulfone forming reagents such as KMnO4 can be used. Hydrogenolyis of the resulting benzyl 6 alpha or beta benzyloxycarbonylaminoalkyl penicillanate 1,1dioxides, V and VI, A SO2 produces the corresponding 6 alpha or beta aminomethyl or l aminoethyl penicillanic acids I and II, Q R1 H .Hydrogenolysis is carried out by methods well known in the penicillin art. The substrate, in a reactioninert solvent, is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst, such as palladium, platinum or rhodium, optionally in the form of its oxide or a salt, or on a carrier such as carbon, an alkaline earth carbonate or alumina. Temperature is not critical e.g. 0 500C , but is preferably 250C or lower in order to minimize thermal degradation.Pressure can be varied over a wide range subatmospheric to 100 atmospheres , but as a matter of convenience will generally be in the range of 1 to 7 atmospheres. The reaction inert solvent is preferably relatively low boiling so as to be readily removed by concentration in vacuo. Aqueous tetrahydrofuran is a solvent particularly well suited for the present purpose. The preferred catalyst is palladium, supported on carbon. To prepare an in vivo hydrolyzable ester i.e., a compound of the formulae I or II , wherein Q is hydrogen and R1 is a radical group forming an ester which is hydrolyzable under physiological conditions , the amino group of the 6 aminoalkyl penicillanic acid l,l dioxide is first protected with a benzyloxycarbonyl group, using methods well known in the art. For example, benzyl chloroformate is added slowly to the amine in a reaction inert solvent such as aqueous acetone or aqueous tetrahydrofuran while maintaining pH 8.0 at a temperature of 0 350C, preferably 0 20 C. In this manner, compounds of the formulae IX and X , wherein R1 is H, are formed. Alternatively, such compounds are formed by the partial hydrogenolysis of compounds of the formula V and VI wherein A is S02. Except to limit hydrogen uptake, conditions as described above are used.EMI14.1 The latter intermediates are then converted to the desired esters of the formulae IX and X , whereinR1 now represents an in vivo hydrolyzable ester, according to known methods, readily identified by those skilled in the penicillin art see for exampleU.S, Patents 4,234,579 and 4,287,181 and European patent publication No. 40,494 . Preferred ester values of R1 have been defined above preferred methods for the preparation of such esters are detailed in specific examples below and in European patent publication No. 40,494. The protected esters IX and X are converted to the desired esters of the formula I or II wherein Q is hydrogen, retaining R1 as the ester functionality, by hydrogenolysis, preferably in the presence of a weakly acidic buffer comprising equimolar quantities of a weakly basic amine, such as pyridin, and a strong acid such as a mineral acid e.g. HCl, UNTO3, H2S04 or preferably a sulfonic acid such as methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid or toluenesulfonic acid , otherwise according to methods described above, taking care to minimize exposure to conditions e.g. water, lower alcohols, high acidity or basicity which will cause hydrolysis of the sensitive ester or beta lactam groups. It is preferred to isolate the ester directly from the reaction mixture in the form of the acid addition salt where the acid is the one used in the buffer. A particularly preferred buffer is pyridinium irtoluenesulfonate in which case the product is usually isolated as its ir toluenesulfonate salt. The compounds of the formulae I and II in the first alternative i.e., wherein n is 1, R is hydrogen and Q is other than hydrogen are readily prepared by reductive alkylation of the simple 6 aminomethyl compounds of the above formulae I and II whereinR and Q are both hydrogen, in the presence of an equimolar amount of the corresponding aldehyde, using sodium cyanoborohydride as the reducing agent. One molar equivalent of the aldehyde is fully satisfactory an excess of sodium cyanoborohydride is generally used, e.g., about two thirds of a mole per mole of substrate. Temperature is not critical and can be in the range 0 500C conveniently ambient temperature is employed. The above defined pharmaceutically acceptabe acid addition salts of the present invention are readily prepared by standard methods. For example, an equivalent of the acid is combined with the free amine form of the compound in an organic or aqueous organic solvent. The salt is isolated by concentration and or the addition of a non solvent. In some cases, the salt is isolated directly from a reaction mixture, without isolation of the free amine. The above defined pharmaceutically acceptable cationic salts of those compounds of the present invention having a free carboxylic acid group are also readily prepared by standard methods. For example, an equivalent of the corresponding cationic hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate or of an amine is combined with the carboxylic acid in an organic or aqueous solvent, preferably at reduced temperature e.g.0 50C , with vigorous agitation and slow addition of the base. The salt is isolated by concentration and or the addition of a non solvent. In some cases, the salt is isolated directly from a reaction mixture, without isolation of the free acid form. The bis methanediol esters III and IV , as well as those of the formulae I and II wherein n is 1 and R1 is 1,l dioxopenicillanoyloxymethyl or n is 2 and R1 is CU2 , are also prepared from the amino protected penicillanic acids acids IX and X , wherein R1 is H. In one alternative, the latter compounds are first converted to the corresponding chloromethyl esters. The preferred method is to convert the acid to its tetrabutylammonium salt, which is then reacted with excess chloromethyl iodide at 0 500C, preferably at 250 or less. Although a chloromethyl ester can be used directly in the next step, it is preferred to first convert the chloromethyl ester to the corresponding iodomethyl ester. Contact of the chloromethyl ester with sodium iodide in acetone at 0 50 until reaction is substantially complete represents conditions particularly well suited to this purpose. The iodomethylester is then reacted, in a reaction inert solvent at 0 500C, with a salt of penicillanic acid 1,l dioxide a salt of the same amino protected penicillanic acid IX or X wherein R1 is H a salt of azidocillin 16 D 2 phenyl 2 azidoacetamido peni cillanic acid or a salt of an ampicillin or amoxicillin derivative of the formulaEMI17.1 wherein Y is H, benzyloxycarbonyloxy, C2 C7 alkoxycarbonyloxy, benzoyloxy, or benzoyloxy mono substituted with C1 C4 alkyl, Cl C4 alkoxy or halo F, C1 orBr . The preferred salt is the tetrabutylammonium salt, since it reacts very rapidly with the iodomethyl ester, minimizing degradation. In a second alternative, the bis methanediol esters III and IV , as well as the esters of the formula I or II where n is 1 and R1 is l,l dioxo penicillanoyloxymethyl are prepared by reacting the above salt of an amino protected penicillanic acid IX or X , wherein R1 is H, with a halomethyl ester preferably and iodomethyl ester of penicillanic acid l,l dioxide, of azidocillin, or of an ampicillin or amoxicillin derivative of the formula XI above. In either alternative, the resulting protected methanediol diester is then converted to the desired end product of the formula I , II where n is 1 andR1 is l,l dioxopenicillanoyloxymethyl or n is 2 and R1 is CR2 , III or IV by hydrogenolysis, using methods detailed above again minimizing exposure to conditions which cleave the sensitive methanediol ester bonds. The pharmaceutically acceptable mono or diacid addition salts of these methanediol diesters are prepared using one or two equivalents of the acid, as appropriate, according to methods described above. Another preferred route to the intermediates of the formulae VII and VIII wherein Y is benzyloxycarbonylamino, particularly when R is methyl, is to prepare them from the corresponding known benzyl 6alpha hydroxymethyl or l hydroxyethyl 6 beta bromo penicillanate and benzyl 6 beta hydroxymethyl or 1 hydroxyethyl 6 alpha bromopenicillanate also prepared from benzyl 6,6 dibromopenicillanate . In the first stage, the above hydroxymethyl or 1hydroxyethyl compounds are converted to the corresponding trifluoromethanesulfonate esters VII and VIII, Y trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy . This reaction is conveniently carried out at room temperature using trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride as reagent, in a reaction inert solvent such as methylene chloride in the presence of at least one equivalent of a tertamine such as pyridine or diisopropylethylamine. In the second stage the sulfonate group is displaced by azide, forming the azidomethyl compounds of the formulae VII and VIII , wherein Y is azido. An excellent reagent for this purpose is tetramethyl guanidinium azide in moderate excess. The reaction is carried out at 0 250C, preferably about lO0C, in a reaction inert solvent such as chloroform or methylene chloride. In the third stage the azido group is reduced to an amino group, yielding compounds of the formulae VII and VIII wherein Y is amino. A convenient reagent for this purpose is hydrogen sulfide, in the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine in a reaction inert solvent such as chloroform. Gaseous hydrogen sulfide is bubbled through the reaction mixture at 0 5O0C until reduction is substantially complete usually about 3 4 hours at 250 . Finally, the amino group is protected with a benzyloxycarbonyl group, using conditions standard in the art. For example benzyl chloroformate as reagent in the presence of a tertiary amine such as pyridine or N,N diisopropylethyl amine, in a reaction inert solvent such as methylene chloride at 0 500C, preferably at reduced temperature O lO0C . The resulting compounds of the formulae VII and VIII wherein yg is benzyloxycarbonylamino are then further processed according to methods detailed above. As indicated above, some of the compounds of the formulae I and II , generally those wherein R1 is hydrogen, have in vitro antibacterial activity. Such activity is demonstrated by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC s in mcg ml against a variety of microorganisms. The procedure which is followed is the one recommended by the InternationalCollaborative Study on Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing Ericcson and Sherris, Acta. Pathologica et Microbiologia Scandinav, Supp. 217, Section B 64 6,8 j19711 , and employs brain heart infusion BHI agar and the inocula replicating device.Overnight growth tubes are diluted 100 fold for use as the standard inoculum 20,000 10,000 cells in approximately 0.002 ml are placed on the agar surface 20 ml of BRI agar dish . Twelve 2 fold dilutions of the test compound are employed, with initial concentration of the test drug being 200 mcg ml. Single colonies are disregarded when reading plates after 18 hours at 370C. The susceptibility MIC of the test organism is accepted as the lowest concentration of compound capable of producing complete inhibition of growth as judged by the naked eye. Those compounds of the formulae I and II having said in vitro antibacterial activity are thus useful as industrial antimicrobials, for example in water treatment, slime control, paint preservation and wood preservation, as well as for topical application as a disinfectant. In the case of use of these compounds for topical application, it is often convenient to admix the active ingredient with a nontoxic carrier, such as vegetable or mineral oil or an emollient cream. Similarly, it can be dissolved or dispersed in liquid diluents or solvents such as water, alkanols, glycols or mixtures thereof. In most instances it is appropriate to employ concentrations of the active ingredient of from about 0.1 percent to about 10 percent by weight, based on total composition. As also indicated above, the compounds of the formulae I and II are of more particular value as potent inhibitors of microbial beta lactamases. By this mechanism they increase the antibacterial effectiveness of beta lactam antibiotics penicillins and cephalosporins against many microorganisms, particularly those which produce a beta lactamase. The ability of the said compounds of the formula I or II to increase the effectiveness of a beta lactam antibiotic can be appreciated by reference to experiments in which the MIC values of the antibiotic alone, and a compound of the formula I or II having R1 as hydrogen alone, are determined.These MIC1s are then compared with the MIC values obtained with a combination of the given antibiotic and the compound of the formula I or II , wherein R1 is hydrogen.When the antibacterial potency of the combination is significantly greater than would have been predicted from the potencies of the individual compounds, this is considered to constitute enhancement of activity.The MIC values of combinations are measured using the method described by Barry and Sabath in Manual ofClinical Microbiology , edited by tenette, Spaulding and Truant, 2nd Edition, 1974, American Society forMicrobiology. The compounds of the formulae I and II enhance the antibacterial effectiveness of beta lactam antibiotics in vivo. That is, they lower the amount of the antibiotic which is needed to protect mice against an otherwise lethal inoculum of certain betalactamase producing bacteria. In determining such activity, acute experimental infections are produced in mice by the intraperitoneal inoculation of the mice with a standardized culture of the test organism suspended in 5 percent hog gastric mucin. Infection severity is standardized so that the mice receive a lethal dose of the organism the lethal dose is the minimum inoculum of organism required to consistently kill 100 percent of the infected, non treated control mice .The test compound in combination with the antibiotic is administered at various dosage levels, or or i.p i. ., to groups of infected mice. At the end of the test, the activity of the mixture is assessed by counting the number of survivors among treated animals at a given dose. Activity is expressed as the percentage of animals which survive at a given dose, or calculated as a PD50 dose which protects 50 of the animals from infection . Compounds of the formulae III and IV are tested for in vivo activity in like manner, except that they are generally dosed alone, not in combination with other beta lactam antibiotics. In determining whether a particular strain of bacteria is sensitive to a particular compound of the formula III or IV it is not necessary to carry out an in vivo test. Instead, the MIC of a 1 1 mixture of a compound of the formula I or II , wherein R1 is hydrogen, and ampicillin or amoxicillin, as appropriate, are measured according to methods described above. The ability of the compounds of formulae I and 11 to enhance the effectiveness of a beta lactam antibiotic against beta lactamase producing bacteria makes them valuable for coadministration with betalactam antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections in mammals, particularly man. In the treatment of a bacterial infection, the compound of the formula I or II can be comingled with the beta lactam antibiotic, and the two agents thereby administered simultaneously. Alternatively, the compound of the formula I or II can be administered as a separate agent during a course of treatment with a beta ladtam antibiotic. In some instances it will be advantageous to pre dose the subject with the compound of the formula I or II before initiating treatment with a beta lactam antibiotic. When using a compound of formula I or 11 to enhance the effectiveness of beta lactam antibiotic, a mixture of I or II with the beta lactam antibiotic is administered preferably in formulation with standard pharmaceutical carriers or diluents. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, a beta lactam antibiotic and a compound of formula I or II will normally contain from about 5 to about 80 percent of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier by weight. When using the compounds of formula I or II in combination with another beta lactam antibiotic, said compounds can be administered orally or parenterally, i.e. intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. Although the prescribing physician will ultimately decide the dosage to be used in a human subject, the ratio of the daily dosages of the compounds of formula I or II and the beta lactam antibiotic will normally be in the range from about 1 3 to 3 1 by weight. Additionally, when using the compounds of formula I or II in combination with another beta lactam antibiotic, the daily oral dosage of each component will normally be in the range from about 10 to about 200 mg per kilogram of body weight and the daily parenteral dosage of each component will normally be about 10 to about 40 mg per kilogram of body weight.These daily doses will usually be divided. In some instances, the prescribing physician will determine that dosages outside these limits are necessary. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, some beta lactam compounds are effective when administered orally or parenterally, while others are effective only when administered by the parenteral route. When a compound of formula I or II is to be used simultaneously i.e. comingled with a betalactam antibiotic which is effective only on parenteral administration, a combination formulation suitable for parenteral use will be required. When a compound of formula I or II is to be used simultaneously comingled with a beta lactam antibiotic which is effective orally or parenterally, combinations suitable for either oral or parenteral administration can be prepared.Additionally, it is possible to administer preparations of the compounds of formula I orally, while at the same time administering a further betalactam antibiotic parenterally and it is also possible to administer preparations of the compounds of formula I parenterally, while at the same time administering the further beta lactam antibiotic orally. It is the capacity of compounds of the formula III or IV to hydrolyze and provide both the compounds of the formula I or II , wherein R1 is hydrogen, and ampicillin or amoxicillin, which enhances the activity and broadens the antibacterial spectrum of these compounds relative to the use of an equivalent amount of ampicillin or amoxicillin alone, particularly by the oral route. When using the present antibacterial compounds of the formula III or IV for control of bacterial infections in a mammal, particularly man, the compound is administered alone, or mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents. Said carrier or diluent is chosen on the basis of the intended mode of administration. For oral administration, tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, powders, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions and suspensions, and the like are used, in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice. The proportional ratio of active ingredient to carrier will naturally depend on the chemical nature, solubility and stability of the active ingredient, as well as the dosage contemplated. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose, sodium citrate and salts of phosphoric acid.Various disintegrants such as starch, and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc, are commonly used in tablets. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols, e.g polyethylene glycols having molecular weights of from 2000 to 4000. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying or suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and or flavoring agents can be added. For parenteral administration, which includes intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and intravenous use, sterile solutions of the active ingredient are usually prepared, and the pH of the solutions are suitably adjusted and buffered.For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. When using compounds of the formula III or IV to control bacterial infections, the daily dosage will be similar to that of other clinically used betalactam antibiotics. Although the prescribing physician will ultimately decide the dosage to be used in a human subject, the compounds of formula III or IV will normally be used orally at dosages in the range from about 20 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, and parenterally at dosages from about 10 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, usually in divided doses. in some instances, the prescribing physician will determine that dosages outside these limits are needed. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples. However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific details of these examples.
