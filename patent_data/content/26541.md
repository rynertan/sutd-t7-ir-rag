# Voltage stabiliser suitable for a telephone set.

## Abstract
Voltage stabiliser for use in a telephone set which in order to obtain a low direct current resistance and a high alternating current impedance comprises two series arranged transistor circuits 15,16,17,18 connected between two terminals 1,2 and a voltage divider 11,19 connected between the terminals 1,2 , the bases of the transistor circuits being connected to the voltage divider 11,19 and the base of the upper transistor circuit being connected via a capacitor 14 to the terminal 2 to which the emitter of the lower transistor circuit has been coupled by means of a resistor 8 .
