# Process of preparing a catalyst component and polymerization of 1 alkenes with such a catalyst component.

## Abstract
A process of preparing a catalyst component for the polymerization of Î± olefins. An organomagnesium com pound is deposited on an inert inorganic support, such as silica, and the product obtained is heated at a temperature of 300 1000 C in a non reducing atmosphere. The support is then combined with one or more compounds of titanium and or vanadium. The process of polymerizing alpha olefins with these catalysts and a co catalyst is also disclosed.
