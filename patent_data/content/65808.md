# Ribbon type electro acoustic transducer with low distortion and improved sensitivity.

## Abstract
A ribbon type electro acoustic transducer has a magnet system which comprises an upper plate 2, 3 and a centre pole 1 between which an air gap 8 is formed. A diaphragm 7 on which conductors 9 are arranged, is disposed in the air gap. The upper plate 2, 3 comprises two plate shaped parts 2 , 3 and 2 , 3 respectively between which a space 11 is formed in which an edge portion of the diaphragm is located. This results in a more homogeneous magnetic field, so that the transducer distortion may be reduced. Moreover, the transducer sensitivity is improved and is suitable for handling signals in the mid range audio frequency spectrum. The cavity 15 enclosed by the magnet system and the diaphragm 7 can be acoustically coupled, as the case may be via an additional cavity, to a bass reflex duct or an additional passive radiator diaphragm.
