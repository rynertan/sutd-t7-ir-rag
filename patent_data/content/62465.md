# Tracking system for optical record medium.

## Abstract
Tracking apparatus and related method for use in a play back system for recovering information from a selected re cording track on an optical record medium such as a video disc 13 . The tracking apparatus produces a tracking error signal representative of the deviation of a scanning reading beam 11 from the centerline of the selected track, and cou ples this error signal to a movable tracking mirror 21 to form a servo for controllably positioning the beam in alignment with the track. The tracking apparatus further includes a defect de tection circuit 41 for monitoring the tracking error signal and producing a pair of control signals that indicate when video disc defects of prescribed types are being scanned, and a threshold detector circuit for comparing the error signal to prescribed positive and negative thresholds that are selective ly variable in accordance with the pair of control signals. A tracking loop disable signal is produced whenever the magni tude of the error signal exceeds either threshold, and this dis able signal is used to uncouple the tracking error signal from the tracking mirror, so that the reading beam is maintained at its current position until the dimple has been passed.
