# Use of nucleating agents for enhancement of efficiency of acid gas scrubbing processes.

## Abstract
A process and plant for enhancing the efficiency of acid gas scrubbing processes in which sorbent is regenerated. The sor bent is contacted with a nucleating agent, for example carbon particles, and optionally a stripping gas, for example natural gas, steam, nitrogen, or COâ‚‚ prior to its regeneration.

## Claims

## Description
USE OF NUCLEATING AGENTS FOR ENHANCEMENT OF EFFICIENCY OF ACID GAS SCRUBBING PROCESSES The removal of acid gases such as H2S, SO2, C02 and the like from natural and synthetic gases containing the same using a sorbent for the acid gas es , regenerating the sorbent to release the acid gas es and returning a lean sorbent to the acid gas removal step is an old and well documented technology. The nature of the sorbents is wide and includes hot potassium carbonate, the alkanolamines, the glycols, as well as sulfinol, and the like to name but a few.Each of these sorbents has a particular advantage for specific acid gases or natural or synthetic gas composition, physical condition of the gas containing the same, as well as purpose of the removal, i.e., clean up a gas stream for combustion or chemical usage or recovery of a gas from the other components, for example CO2 from a flue gas. Recent pressures on treatment or recovery costs in light of escalating gas prices, environmental concerns, and or potential large volume uses of a com ponent, e.g., CO2, if price is low, have prompted mod ification of the commercially practiced process to increase the loadings of the sorbents and or increase the acid gas removal capacity or gas recovery capac ity in existing plants by using higher concentrations of sorbents as well as more difficulty regenerated sorbents.These modified processes usually require higher heat duty in the regeneration units, in many cases resulting in, in addition to higher fuel costs, more severe corrosion problems It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a means to more effectively util ize these modified processes while reducing costs and corrosion problems attendant the regenerator sections in the modified versions. In accordance with the present invention, a rich sorbent solution, for example potassium carbonate, an alkanolamine such as monoetilanolamine, a glycol, or sulfinol, can have the acid gas content reduced prior to regeneration by contacting the rich sorbent with a nucleating agent eg. carbon particles , with or without subjecting the rich sorbent to gas stripping.The effect of these two simple operations flashes a considerable amount of the acid gases held by the sorbent. These acid gases can be combusted if the stripping gas is a combustible gas, or recovered or reacted as in a Claus tail gas unit. The result of flashing part of the acid gas content of the rich sorbent is that less heat is required to regenerate the sorbent, in certain instances, reduces the load on tail gas recovery or conversion units, and reduces the corrosion potential in the regeneration section. Substantially any nucleating agent may be employed so long as it does not react with the sor bent or the acid gas es being nucleated. One can employ carbon particles, activated carbon or char coal particles, ceramic particles, wire meshes, non woven mat or packings and the like. Similarly, the nature of the stripping gas is not critical so long as it does not react with either the sorbent or the acid gas es . One can thus employ natural gas, treated or untreated, synthetic gas es , steam, nitrogen, carbon dioxide if C02 is not the gas being sorbed, and the like. It is also to be understood that although the nucleating agent may be employed alone, improved results are obtained when the stripping gas is also employed. It is further to be understood that the operations may be carried out individually in differ ent vessels, if so, preferably with the nucleating step being the first. Several modifications in existing commer cial gas treating plants are illustrated in the draw ings of which Figure 1 represents a flow diagram of a commercial acid gas treating plant incorporating the modification of the present invention Figure 2 represents the same plant with only the stripping gas being incorporated Figure 3 illustrates a flow diagram of the same plant using both nucleation and stripping gas wherein the stripping gas is the fuel gas to the reboiler of the stripping still regenerator Figure 4 illustrates a commercial plant utilizing only nucleation in accordance with the present invention and, Figure 5 illustrates the use of fuel gas to an eductor to decrease the partial pressure over a nucleating bed. In accordance with the present invention, a gas treating plant as illustrated in Figure 1 consisting of a contactor or absorber 10 which provides a countercurrent contact of a sorbent with the sour gas 11 to be treated, a rich lean heat exchanger 12 and in accordance with the present invention a rich sorbent flash tank 13 containing the nucleating agent 14 and provisions for distributing the stripping gas 15 , optionally a booster pump 16 , and a stripping still or regenerator 17 having, a a reboiler 18 associated with it to heat the sorbent, and, b a condenser 19 to condense the overhead, for return as a liquid the condensed sorbent through c an accumulator 20 to the top of the still 17 . The hot lean sorbent 21 from the reboiler 18 after passing through the rich lean exchanger 12 , a booster pump 22 if necessary, and a lean cooler 23 to cool the sorbent to the best sorbing temperature is returned via pump 24 , to the contactor 10 . The modification is simple and can be incorporated with little capital investment. The savings in fuel, corrosion and the like as well as the ability to increase both the concentration of the sorbent solution and the loadings of acid gas in the sorbent, all constitute economic advantages as well as permitting retrofit usage of existing plants many designed for 10 20 percent aqueous sorbent solutions.
