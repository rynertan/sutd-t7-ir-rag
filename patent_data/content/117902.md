# Process for producing divalent silver oxide cathode material.

## Abstract
Discloses an oxidic silver cathode which contains the reaction product of divalent silver oxide and lead sulfide which are reacted together under mixing conditions in the presence of warm aqueous alkali, for example, at a tempera ture in excess of about 50 C and the process whereby the material contained in this cathode is made.
