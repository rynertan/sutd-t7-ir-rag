## Description
A MECHANICAL AID FOR USE WITH BETTING SYSTEMS The present invention relates to a mechancial aid for use with betting systems and primarily but not exclusively to a mechanical aid for assistance when writing out betting forecasts in such betting systems as those where a forecast is to be made of the correct result of each of a selected number of competitive events, for example football matches, horse races, such as flat racing, trotting races etc, each of which can finish in at least two different results.The invention also relates to a mechanical aid for assisting in the compilation of such betting systems as those which require a forecast to be made of a correct sequence of numbers drawn from a receptacle containing a relatively large number of numbers, and also to a mechanical aid for the compilation and checking of systems in which a forefast is to be made of a given number of drawn football matches or highest score football matches on football coupons intended herefor. This type of forecasting is carried out over much of the world, and is applied in may different forms of sport, such as football, horse racing, greyhound racing and number lotteries for example. One popular sport in which such betting forecast systems are applied is football. InSweden, for example, there is a system called the correctresult system, which requires the results of thirteen different football matches specified on a coupon to be forecast correctly, of which matches each can finish in a home win, an away win or a draw. This kind of betting forecast is also applied in horse racing.In this respect, there are used in Sweden systems in which a combined forecast is made of the results of a trotting meeting involving five or six specified races, such meetings being known inSweden as VS races and V65 races, where the winning horse of each of the five or six races is forecast. In this case the number of permutations which need to be made to obtain the winner of each race corresponds to the number of horses in the race. The simplest form of betting forecast of this kind is one in which a single, specific forecast is made for each event listed, e.g. for each football match on the coupon or for each race on the card. This type of forecast is often referred to as a single line straight forecast. Obviously, the statistical probability of making an allcorrect, single line forecast is very small.When a forecasting system of this kind is used to forecast the results of thirteen football matches in a single line, the odds of obtaining a correct forecast are 1 to 1,594,323, while in the case of a V65 trotting forecast the odds of making a correct forecast are one times the mathematical product of the number of horses in each race, which when each race includes ten horses is one to one million.Consequently, in order to increase their chances of winning, many punters forecast a multiplicity of different possible results, i.e. they include a large number of lines, normally by means of combination or permutation forecastsWhen making such forecasts, the punter will normally enter on his coupon a line of so called bankers or straight forecasts, consisting of what, in his opinion, are the most likely results for each event, and will then enter against one or more events where the result is not so certain, in the opinion of the punter, one or more alternative results, so called guarding selections or forecasts.This type of forecast betting is known as multiple forecasting or combination forecasting, where the total number of lines involved depends upon the number of events or matches guarded with alternative forecasts, and upon how comprehensively the punter has guarded his forecasts, i.e. how many different possible results have been included in order to cover or partially cover each event or match. Thus, if two different possible results are forecast for each of two events, there is obtained a forecast system which incorporates four separate lines. this system sometimes being referred to as a 4 line system.Systems or permutations of this kind are relatively easy to enter on the coupon, since t is nor mally allowable simply to enter the different results forecasted for each separate event on one and the same coupon, whereafter the person to whom the coupon is submitted is readily able to calculate the number of lines involved, and hence the total sum wagered. The betting authorities to whom the coupon is finally submitted have set routines for assessing the results of such systems. The number of lines entered through such systems, however, can grow very rapidly, and therewith the total sum wagered rapidly increases, even when relatively few events are covered by alternative, guarding forecasts.For example, if five matches are fully covered when forecasting the results of a thirteen match, correct forecast coupon, so as to fully cover all three possible results of five matches, while the remaining eight matches are considered as bankers, i.e. are considered to be certain results and are accordingly written as single, straight forecasts, a multiple system of the above kind will incorporate 243 lines. Correspondingly, if, in the case of a V65 trotting meeting, it is desired to forecast three different possible winning horses in each of five races and two different possible winners in the sixth race, the combination will include not less than 486 lines.Because of the large number of lines involved, so called economy systems and reduced systems are now being used to an ever increasing extent, in which, with the aid of a mathematical model, certain lines are selected from the total number of lines incorporated in a total combination forecast of all events guarded by the punter with alternative forecasts, referred to here as guarded forecasts. In this respect, the punter is desirous of obtaining, with as few lines as possible and as cheaply as possible, a high probability of obtaining at least some lines which contain a sufficient number of correct forecasts to qualify for a win, provided that the row of bankers or straight forecasts contains a certain least number of correct results.Thus, when the line of bankers entered by the punter contains a given number of correct results these systems give a guarantee regarding the pro bability of obtaInIng a certain number of lines with a certain number of dividend returning correct results.It is seldom that such economy systems can be compiled by the punter himself, since the work involved is relatively time consuming and required a certain knowledge of mathematics. Furthermore, systems of this kind are relatively difficult to write out, since they will comprise a multiplicity of single lines or a plurality of smaller multiple systems, or combinations of single lines and multiple systems which include different numbers of lines. It is true that persons compiling such systems have access to tables and models from which the compilator can obtain assistance in the compilation of his particular system. Despite this, however, the work required is excessively time consuming and relatively complicated, and can readily lead to errors being made.The models or tables at present available to system compilators are namely based on leaving unguarded a given number of the events listed, e.g. football matches, while guarding the remaining events, e.g. matches, in a given manner, for example by guarding a given number of said matches with a single alternative result, by guarding a further given number of the matches with two alternative results, and by fully covering the remaining matches. Na turally the tables or models cannot, however, take into account the fact that different punters will select different matches as unguarded or guarded in one way or the other. Consequently, each punter must adapt the table or model acquired from the system compilator to the matches which he, the punter, elects to guard or to leave unguarded, as the case may be. This is a relatively complicated procedure, which can easily result in error. Naturally, each error detracts from the validity of the guarantees provided by the system in question. In reality, many punters lack the ability or patience to make such adaptations. Consequently, various forms of mechanical aids have been proposed which incorporate scales or the like, which can be set relative to one another and which are intended for use when writing out combination forecasts in accordance with a system determined by the designer of the mechanical aid in question. These known mechanical aids, however, are also relatively difficult to use, and can readily cause error when writing out system forecasts. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved mechanical aid for writing out and or checking system forecasts of the kind described in the introduction. The characterizing features of a mechanical aid according to the invention are set forth in the accompanying claims. A mechanical aid according to the invention can be designed for any forecast of the aforementioned kind whatsoever, i.e. for any number of different forecast events whatsoever, such as football matches, horse racing and the like, and for any number of different possible results for each event included in the forecast. It can also be programmed for any type of economy system or reduced system, and may also be designed for use when writing out several different systems. Despite its flexibility, the aid is easy to use and affords the punter complete freedom in selecting which events to leave unguarded or to guard, and also to select the extent to which the guarded events are covered.In systems which include permutations of a given number of drawn football matches, such as a straight permutation of any eight matches from eleven selected matches, or the forecast of eight drawn matches from a selected number of matches, say sixteen matches, on the coupon, where any eight drawn matches from the sixteen matches selected guarantees at least some form of dividend, or in systems which include the permutation of selected numbers in a number lottery, it may not be necessary to make guarded forecasts in the manner indicated above. In this case the mechanical aid can be used to write the permutation in full and or to check the entry against the results of matches played or numbers drawn, as explained in more detail hereinafter. The aid may also be used to compile individual betting systems.As will be understood from the following, when using the mechanical aid according to the invention, there is very little chance of making an error even when writing out highly complicated and comprehensive forecast systems. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to an exemplary embodiment of a mechanical aid constructed in accordance with the invention and illustrated in the accompanying drawing. The illustrated embodiment of a mechanical aid according to the invention is intended for use when forecasting the results of thirteen football matches, so called singleline, correct result forecasts, and provides a choice between two different basic systems. The mechanical aid according to the invention includes a thin, rectangular base plate or frame 1 and a cursor 2.For the sake of illustration, the illustrated cursor is shown to one side of the plate 1, although in reality it is mounted on the plate for movement there along in the longitudinal direction of said plate. The base plate 1 is provided on at least one side or face thereof with a rectangular grid, which includes a plurality of lines 3, the number of lines coinciding with the number of different events included in the forecast system in question, said lines extending parallel with the direction of movement of the cursor 2. As will be understood, because the illustrated aid is intended for forecasting the results of thirteen football matches, the grid includes thirteen lines 3.Extending at right angles to the lines 3 is a number of columns 4, said number being dependent upon the specific system for which the mechanical aid is designed. The mechanical aid of the illustrated embodiment is deisgned so that it can be used for writingout two different systems, System 1 and System 2, the grid for System 1 including ten columns 4, while the grid forSystem 2 includes twenty columns.To the left of the grid for each system there is provided for each line, i.e. for each match, an indication as to whether or not a match or event is to be left unguarded or to be guarded, respectively, in the system used. Thus, in the illustrated embodimentSystem 1 requires eight matches to be left unguarded, i.e.written as bankers, and five matches to be guarded. Correspondingly, System 2 of the illustrated embodiment requires six matches to be left unguarded and the remaining seven matches to be guarded. As beforementioned, by unguarded is meant a straight forecast, while by guarded is meant a forecast which covers alternative results. In the illustrated mode of the aid according to the invention, the last eight matches are unguarded when using System 1, while inSystem 2 the last six matches are unguarded. Conveniently, however, the aid is so designed that the lines 3 of the grid are arranged on separate strips which can be remove ably inserted into the base plate 1 and which can be removed from said base plate by the punter and relocated in a desired sequence.This enables the punter himself to decide, arbitrarily, which matches shall be left unguarded when writing out a forecast system. When using System 1, the punter can thus select any eight matches to be left unguarded, by correspondingly re arranging the strips on which the lines 3 are drawn. When using System 2, the punter can choose any six matches to be unguarded, by corresponding rearrangement of the strips. As will be understood, the array of guarded and unguarded matches exhibited by an assembled grid is peculiar to the system selected by the punter. On the lines or strips 3 which concern guarded matches, certain squares in the grid are marked, these markings in the illustrated embodiment having the form of circles, the purpose of which will be made apparent hereinafter.These markings have been applied by the person manufacturing the mechanical aid, and the positioning of the markings is determined by the design or compilation of the system in question. The cursor 2 is provided with a window 5 which leaves a column 4 in the grid uncovered when the cursor is mounted on the base plate 1 in the aforedescribed manner. Along its left hand edge the cursor 2 is provided with information concerning the number of the matches on the coupon to be filled in, in this case thirteen although the number may equally as well be twelve or twentyfour, or any desired number. Immediately to the left of the window 5 is a space in which the punter can initially write down his row of selections, i.e. the primary final result which he wishes to forecast for each individual match. The cursor 2 is made from a material which allows the row of bankers to be readily written in by the punter and then erased, subsequent to having transferred said primary selections from the cursor onto the coupon. In the illustrated embodiment, it is assumed that the selections made by the punter form row 1 X 2 112 X2X 1212, where 1 represents a home win, 2 an away win and X a draw. Immediately to the right of the window 5, the cursor 2 is provided with a space in which the punter can write down those alternative guarding results which he wishes to forecast for each of the matches which the system in question allows to be guarded with alternative forecasts. In the illustrated embodiment, it is assumed that the punter intends using System 1, and that he has elected not to guard the last eight matches with alternative forecasts, and hence the aid shall be used with the lines or strip 3 in the grid mounted in the numbered sequence illustrated, by way of example, in the drawing. As an example, it is shown in the drawing that the punter has elected to guard match number 1 with a single alternative result, in this case with an X to guard match number 2 with two alternative results, with a 1, 2 to guard match 3 with a single alternative result, 1 to fully cover match number 4, with 1, X, 2 and to guard match number 5 with two alternative results, with X, 2. These alternative, guarding selections can also be erased subsequent to transferring said selections onto the coupon. The following steps are taken when writing the forecast system onto the coupon. The cursor 2 is moved along the base plate 1 until the window 5 exposes the first column 4 to the left of the grid of the system which the punter intends to use, in the illustrated embodimentSystem 1. The punter then enters his first line of selections on the coupon, copying the forecasts previously written on the cursor to the left of the window for each match for which the column 4 visible through the window 5 in the cursor 2 contains no markings, i.e. no indication that alternative forecasts shall be made. For each match marked with a circle in the column 4 located on the base plate 1 and visible through the window, the punter instead enters a guarded result, which he has previously recorded on the cursor 2, to the right of the window 5.In the illustrated example the punter in his first selected line thus writes an X for match number 1, a 1 and a 2 for match number 2, and a 1 for match number 3, while matches 4 13 are filled in according to the row of primary selections or straight forecasts written to the left of the window 5 on cursor 2. Consequently, the first line filled in by the punter will constitute a two line system. The punter then onntinues in the same manner, by moving the cursor 2 to the ight, so that the window exposes each column 4 in the grid of System 1 in sequence, the punter entering a line on the coupon with the guidance of each such column.Thus, the complete system will contain ten lines, each of which may be a single line or a multiple system incorporating a multiplicity of single lines, depending upon how the punter has elected to guard the five different matches which the system allows to be guarded. For example, the System 1, illustrated by way of example, will give ten single lines if the punter elects to guard each of the guardable matches with only one alternative forecast. If the punter, instead, elects to guard each of the five guardable matches with two alternative results, the complete system will comprise ten 8 line systems. On the other hand, should the punter elect to guard said five guardable matches against all three possible results, the complete system will comprise ten 27 line systems.As will be understood, many other combinations can be com piled, depending upon how the punter has elected to guard the five guardable matches. In the illustrated system of two matches guarded with a single alternative result, two matches guarded with two alternative results, and one match guarded for all three possible results, the complete system will comprise two 2 line systems, one 3 line system, two 4 line systems, four 6 line systems and one 12 line system. It can be mentioned that System 1 on the mechanical aid illustrated in the drawing is designed to contain all possible permutations of three guarded matches from a total of five guarded matches. Correspondingly, System 2 of the illustrated embodiment is designed to contain all possible permutations of five guarded matches from a total of seven guarded matches. It will be understood, however, that a mechanical aid according to the invention can be pre programmed by the manufacturer through the arrangement of markings on the grid, so that practically any desired system can be obtained, although the individual punter will always be at liberty to select which matches are to be left unguarded, i.e. written as straight forecasts, and the manner in which the guarded matches shall be covered. As described above, the illustrated embodiment is designed to provide a choice between two different systems,System 1 or System 2. Naturally, the mechanical aid can be designed to provide a choice between still more systems, by extending the base plate 1 to provide room for several systems placed side by side. In one advantageous embodiment, the other side of the base plate 1 may also be provided with a similar grid for further systems. In this case, the cursor 2 may be designed to enable it to be turned and mounted on the other side of the base plate 1, or cursor 2 can have the form of a sleeve which embraces and covers both sides of the base plate 1, and which is designed in the illustrated manner on both sides of the base plate. A similar result can also be obtained by providing the removably mounted strips 3 with markings on both sides thereof, and by mounting the strips in the base plate 1 with one or the other side facing alternatively outwardly. It will be obvious from the aforegoing that a mechanical aid according to the invention can also de designed for use in other types of betting forecasts, such as the aforementioned Swedish V5 and V65 forecastings, for example. In this case, all that is required is for the number of lines in the grid to be brought to correspond with the number of events. It may also be necessary to change the design of the cursor 2, so as to provide space for a larger number of guarded forecasts, since in trotting races, for example, each race may have up to fifteen different horses entered, and a corresponding number of possible results. In the aforegoing it has been assumed that the markings on the grid of the base plate are permanent and produced by the manufacturer of the mechanical aid, in agreement with one or possibly more different systems compiled by him. It will be understood, however, that a mechanical aid according to the invention can also be made, and sold to the user, without any markings on the grid on the base plate 1. In this case, the punter himself fills in the markings in the grid, in accordance with a desired system, which system may be compiled by the punter himself or acquired from the manufacturer of the mechanical aid, or from some other systemcompilator. By making the base plate from a material which enables the markings to be readily erased, one and the same aid can be used for a practically unlimited number of different systems, by placing the markings corresponding to the system desired at that point in time temporarily in the grid. The only limitation in this respect is that the system used may no require more columns than those provided by the grid on the base plate. If more columns than those provided are required, the punter may use two mechanical aids according to the invention, each provided with markings corresponding to a respective part of the system.Alternatively, it is possible to manage with a single mechanical aid, by first entering into the grid markings corresponding to only a part of the complete system and using these markings for writing out the first part of a system, and by then erasing said markings and replacing them with markings for the remainder of the system, whereafter this remaining part of the system can be written onto the coupon, using the mechanical aid herefor.Thus, a mechanical aid constructed in accordance with the invention and containing no permanent markings in the grid on the base plate allows the punter a great deal of freedom, since he is able progressively to collect marking patterns for a growing number of different systems, which he can insert onto the base plate of the mechanical aid as and when desired. As beforementioned, the mechanical aid according to the invention may also be used to compile and or check system forecasts which do not require the use of guarded selections. In English football systems, for example, it is possible to select sixteen matches which the punter considers will result in a draw. The punter enters these selections on his coupon, and writes against these selections the system which he elects to use. Most systems guarantee at least a low dividend, provided that eight of the selected sixteen matches result in draws. Although in this case the system in question is pub lishes in its fully extended form by the football pools authoriles, it is extremely difficult to check the results correctly, remembering that the failure to claim a first dividend may result in the loss of that dividend. Checking of the system used can be made easy by the mechanical aid according to the invention, since all that is required is for the system to be written onto the baseplate or base plates 5 and the results of the sixteen matches written onto the cursor 2, whereafter the cursor is moved from column to column on the grid and the total number of points collected in each line recorded at the bottom of a respective column. Block permutation can be compiled, recorded and checked in a similar manner. With regard to number lotteries, where a punter shall forecast, for example, the first six numbers drawn from a bank of thirtysix numbers, systems incorporating permutations or combinations embracing seven, eight or any number of numbers may be compiled, written and checked on the aid according to the invention, all according to the stakes which the punter is willing to place. As will be understood, one and the same mechanical aid can be provided with more than one set of markings, selectively usable for various types of football forecasts and number forecasts, etc..
