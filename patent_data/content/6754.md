# Testing apparatus for cassette type tape recorders.

## Abstract
A testing apparatus for cassette type tape recording and or playback machines has a cassette shell 10 for mounting on the machine in place of the regular tape cas sette, the cassette shell having driven means such as spools 14 and 15 displaceably mounted within the cassette shell and adapted to be engaged and displaced respectively by the forward and rewind spindles of the machine when either of such spindles is actuated. Indicator means 22 indicate the torque applied to either of the driven means by virtue of an indicating pointer 24 adapted to move over a scale from a central rest position to which the pointer is spring biased, flexible means such as leader tape 18 intercon necting the pointer 24 to both of the driven means 14 and 15 . Preferably the spring biasing and pointer are integrally formed in a T shape with a pivotal mounting 21 at the junction of the T such that the arms 25 bend resil iently upon displacement of the pointer 24 .
