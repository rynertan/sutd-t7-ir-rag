# Electron microscope.

## Abstract
An electron microscope has a two dimensional sensor 10 located at the image formation plane 9 . The two dimensional sensor stores electron beam energy and emits light upon exposure to light or heat. The filament 3a is located at a position displaced from the principal optical axis of the electron beam so that the image of the filament may not be recorded on the two dimensional sensor. The two dimensional sensor is, for example, made of stimulable phosphor.
