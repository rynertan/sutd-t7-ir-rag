# Glasses for ophthalmic applications.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with the production of glasses suitable for ophthalmic applications having refrac tive indices of 1.523 0.004, Abbe number between 51 59, densities less than 2.43g cmÂ³, transmissions at 400nm in 2 mm thickness greater than 89 , and a UV cutoff between 310 335nm, said glasses consisting essentially, in weight percent on the oxide basis, of
