The follower 30 extends across the interior of the con tainer shell 10 to exert a downward force on bulk material M in the container to assist removal through an outlet 22 whilst wiping the interior walls of the container. The shell has a clos able access opening 13 in the top in alignment with an open ing 40 in the follower 30 and the bottom of a tube 50 is fixed to the follower 30 with the tube 50 to communicate the container below the follower 30 with the tube 50 via the opening 40 for filling the container. The tube 50 is accessi ble through the access opening 13 and is closable by a clamp 51 during a material removal operation. Chains 55 are pro vided for raising the follower 30 during a filling operation.
