# Internally coated reaction vessel for use in olefinic polymerization.

## Abstract
A method of preventing or retarding polymer build up on the internal surfaces of polymerization reactors is provided by this invention. Reduced build up in vinyl chloride polymerization is obtained by having a phenolic compound coated on the internal surfaces of the reactor vessel and a water phase polymerization inhibitor either combined with the phenolic coating or added to the aqueous polymerization medium. Optionally, a chelating agent is also added with the water phase inhibitor. The process is further enhanced by the presence of water soluble disper sants such as polyvinyl alcohol and methyl cellulose.
