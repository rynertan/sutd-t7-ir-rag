# LIGHT MODULATOR COMPRISING AN OPTICAL FIBRE

## Abstract
A fibre optic modulator comprises an optical fibre 2 and a waveguide 10 of active material. The waveguide 10 is dimen sioned such that any mode of the waveguide has a propoga tion constant which is separated from the propogation con stant of the optical fibre mode by an amount equal to or greater than λ L where λ is the wavelength of transmitted electromag netic radiation in the mode of the optical fibre and L is the length of the effective portion of the waveguide of active mate rial.
