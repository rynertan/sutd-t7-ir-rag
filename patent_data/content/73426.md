# CONTROLLABLE TOOL FEEDING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A tool feeding head ist provided, which is adapted for rapid attachment to and detachment form a machine spin dlehead. The head includes a shaft which is joinable to a machine spindle of the spindlehead for coupling rotary driv ing motion from the spindle to either a cross feed or feed out cutting tool, the shaft being provided with a bore. An actuating rod is mounted in the bore for engaging the tool, the actuating rod feeding the tool when the actuating rod is reciprocated within the bore by a rod reciprocating mechan ism. A system or device for controllably driving the rod reciprocating mechanism is immovably fixed to the machine spindlehead, the driving system operating the rod recipro cating mechanism to cause the actuating rod to feed the selected tool at a prespecified rate. Structure supporting the shaft and the reciprocating mechanism enables an automat ic tool changer to selectively join the shaft to the spindle, and place the rod reciprocating mechanism in operative relationship with the driving system.
