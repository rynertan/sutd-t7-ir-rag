# Reversible feeder system.

## Abstract
A cyclical lubricant feeder utilizing series spool valves to dispense measured quantities of lubricant to dispensing out lets 120, 121 from a common feed source 11 with a plurality of the spool valves arranged in series in valve block assemblies 15 which in turn are in series with one another whereby dis pensing through the outlet 120, 121 for each spool valve in a block assembly 15 is in progression with the other outlets from the spool valves 120, 121 in the valve block assembly 15 is provided with a control valve 124 controlling inlet and outlet flow to the valve block assembly bypassing flow from the inlet 140 to the outlet 141 when all of the valves in the block have been shifted to one side and bypassing flow from the out let 141 to the inlet 140 upon reverse lubricant flow to the block only when all of the valves in the block have been shifted to the other side.
