# Method for the preparation of integral shaped replications of shaped, porous and dissolvable materials for use as adsorbents in fixed bed adsorption processes.

## Abstract
Integral shaped replications which may be used as supports for catalysts or as adsorbents comprise a carbo naceous pyropolymer structure which has been prepared by treating a substrate material with an organic pyrolyzable precursor compound and pyrolyzing the precursor at 500 to 1200 C, in a reducing atmosphere to form a carbonaceous pyropolymer possessing recurring units containing at least carbon and hydrogen atoms on the surface of the substrate material. This carbonaceous pyropolymer duplicates the physical shape and dimensions of the substrate material as well as a substantial portion of the pore structure thereof. The integral shaped replications possess an apparent bulk density ABD which is 25 to 100 of the ABD of the inorganic support, and have a crush strength of from 0.5 to 14 kilograms. The composite comprising the carbonaceous pyropolymer on the surface of the substrate material is then bleached with a dissolving agent to remove the substrate material, thus leaving a shaped replication of particle aggregates, if so desired, the shaped replication may be further treated by depositing at least one inorganic oxide on each surface of the replication and or by depositing at least one catalytically active metal and optionally removing the carbonaceous pyropolymer by oxidation.
