# Two stage hydrolysis process for polymerization of nylon 6.

## Abstract
A two stage hydrolysis process for polymerizing epsilon caprolactam is disclosed comprising a first stage from a temperature of about 180 C. 260 C., a pressure of 20 to 150 psig, 138 1034 kPa for a period of about 0.5 to 4 hours, then before equilibrium conditions are reached a second stage at a temperature of about 200 C. 260 C., a pressure of aboul 100 900 Torr 13 120 kPa, absolute for a period of about 2 to 15 hours, while continuously removing most of the water so that water is removed both during hydrolyzation and dur ing the subsequent polycondensation, whereby the cyclic dimer content of the shaped polymer article is below 0.2 percent by weight.
