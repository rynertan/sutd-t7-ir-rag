# Air separation process with single distillation column for combined gas turbine system.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to an air separation system for the recovery of pressurized, substantially pure oxygen gas. The system uses a single pressure distillation column and burns a nitrogen oxygen waste stream to provide power for the air compressor, the oxygen product compressor and electric generation. The distillation column has a split feed to develop reflux and reboil and to provide initial separation of the liquid and vapor components of the column.
