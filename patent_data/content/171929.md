# Tracking error detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A tracking error detecting apparatus for an optical head OH includes a semiconductor laser apparatus 1 , a diffrac tion grating 3 , a beam splitter 4 , an objective lens 5 and a photo detector 17 . A laser beam L from the laser appar atus 1 is divided by the diffraction grating 3 into a main beam L₀ and two side beams L ₁,L ₁ at opposite sides of the main beam. The three beams pass through the beam splitter 4 and the lens 5 to reach an optical recording medium 6 . The beams are reflected from the medium 6 , pass through the lens 5 to the beam splitter 4 , and are reflected therefrom. The reflected beams are incident on the photodetector 7 and outputs of at least two beams of the three beams from the photo detector 7 are used to produce a tracking error signal corresponding to the tracking state of the main beam L₀ on the medium 6 . The reflection of a side beam Lb of the beams reflected from the medium 6 , which passes through the lens 5 , the beam splitter 4 and the diffraction grating 3 and returns to the laser apparatus 1 , is suppressed at a laser beam emission end face 1A so as thereby to reduce influence of skew of the medium 6 on the tracking error signal.
