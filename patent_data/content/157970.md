# Speed control for manufacturing process.

## Abstract
A drive control circuit is provided for assuring equal spacing of folded paper boxes 16 in a stacker mechanism 15 during manufacturing. Each box is folded in a gluer 13 . As each box, in succession, transfers to the stacker mecha nism 15 a counter 20 produces a variable width pulse. These pulses are converted into fixed width pulses with fre quency proportional to the rate at which the folded paper boxes 16 transfer to the stacker mechanism 15 . The control circuit converts these fixed width pulses to constant energy pulses and integrates the constant energy pulses to provide a DC set point signal for a DC motor drive speed control circuit 24 . During operation, the control assures that the stacker mechanism 15 advances a substantially fixed, incremental distance each time a folded paper box 16 is received from the gluer 13 , thereby to ensure substantially even spatial distribution of the boxes 16 along the stacker mechanism.
