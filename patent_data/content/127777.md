# Method and device for controlling welding power supply.

## Abstract
A control device essentially including a first switch means SW5 consisting of at least one switching element to be turned on and off to control the output current of the power supply, second switch means SWD adapted to be inserted in a welding current attenuating path when the first switch means is in off state, and an impedance means RA consist ing of at least one impedance element connected parallel with the second switch means SWD .
