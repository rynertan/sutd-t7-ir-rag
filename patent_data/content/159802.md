# ENGINE INTAKE SYSTEM WITH MODULATED TUNING

## Abstract
Modulated tuning intake systems for multi cylinder inter nal combustion engines are described wherein dual plenums 28, 29 are each connected to essentially half the engine cylin ders 1 6 and tuned to provide enhanced charging efficiency in a predetermined, normally lower, range of engine speeds. A controlled valved connector 36 is provided between the ple nums 28, 29 to effectively modify or eliminate their separate character by joining them at other selected engine speeds, such as the middle and higher speed ranges, thus providing en hanced charging efficiency at these speeds and obtaining im proved volumetric cylinder charging efficiency over all, or a ma jor portion, of the engine operating speed range.
