## Description
BACKGROUND OF TRE INVENTION i Field of the Invention This invention relates to hair growth promoting compositions and more particularly, to hair growth promoting compositions comprising blood flow increasing agents and or hair matrix cell activators, and carbon dioxide gas.ii Description of the Prior Art In conventional hair growth promoting compositions, it is usual to use synthetic substances or extracts from natural products having the blood flow increasing action or hair matrix cell activating action.However, satisfactory effects cannot be obtained when such substances or extracts are used only in smail amounts. Although certain effects are obtained when large amounts of the substances or extracts are used, they tend to objectionably irritate sites on which the growth promoting composition is applied. If such growth promoting composition is continuously applied, dermatitis may appear. Meanwhile, it is known that carbon dioxide has the vasodilative action. A carbon dioxide bath is clinically used for rehabilitation. SUMMARY OF THE lnvviTION With the above in mind, we have made extensive studies to suitahly apply carbon dioxide to hair growth promoting compositions. As a result, it was found that use of carbon dioxide in combination with blood flow increasing agents and or hair matrix cell activators is very effective. More particularly, it was found that when carbon dioxide is used in combination with blood flow increasing agents, it is possible to increase the flow of blood through scalp and retain the increase of the blood flow. Likewise, the combination of carbon dioxide with hair matrix cell activators results in vasilidation of capillary vessels in the scalp, with the hair matrix cell activator efficiently arriving at the matrix cells and serving to activate the cells.Thus, these combinations lead to reduction of falling out of the hair and acceleration of growth of the hair. The present invention is accomplished based on the above finding. According to the present irVention, there is provided a hair growth promoting composition which comprises a blood flow increasing agent and or a hair matrix cell activator in admixture with carbon dioxide gas, and tightly sealed in a pressure resistant container. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBOOIMENTS The blood flow incrPsino agents to be used in the present invention include, for example, synthetic substances or substances derived from natural products such as dQ a tocopheryl acetate, pyridoxine dicaprylate, biotin, nicotinic acid and derivatives thereof, tolazoline hydrochloride, glyceryl glycyrrhetinate, hinokitiol, and extracts from various plants such asSwertia japonica, garlic, Angelica acutiloba Kitagawa,Cnidium, dried orange peel, camomile, and peppermint.Of these, di a tocopheryl acetate, and Swertia japonica,Angelica acutiloba Kitagawa, and Cnidium extracts are preferred. The hair matrix cell activators include, for example, synthetic or natural products such as vitamin A acid, pantothenic acid and derivatives thereof, pantothenyl alcohol and derivatives thereof, t aspartic acid and derivatives thereof, photosensitive principleNo. 301, ethynylestradiol, placenta extract, iron chlorophyll and the like. Of these, vitamin A acid, potassium pantothenate, pantothenyl alcohol, and placenta extract are preferred. These blood flow increasing agents and or hair matrix cell activators are ordinarily used by dissolving in water or mixtures of water and lower alcohols.Preferably, the blood flow increasing agent and or hair matrix cell activator is used in an amount of 0.001 to 5 wt hereinafter referred to simply as of the hair growth promoting composition. Smaller amounts are not favorable because satisfactory effects cannot be obtained, whereas larger amounts result in disagreeable stimulation against the scalp. Carbon dioxide is known to be present as CO2 molecules when dissolved in an acidic solution and show the vasodilative action. In this sense, the hair growth promoting composition of the present invention is generally adjusted to be in the range of pH 7 or less, preferably from 4.5 to 6.5. It will be noted that the hair growth promoting composition of the invention becomes more acidic when carbon dioxide is charged under pressure and dissolved in the growth promoting composition. The final pH range should be adjusted as defined above. For the adjustment of the pH, there are used organic acids such as citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid and the like or salts thereof, and phosphoric acid or salts thereof. For the incorporation of carbon dioxide into the hair growth promoting composition, several methods are conveniently used. In one such method, a hair growth promoting composition is placed in a pressureresistant container, into which high pressure gas is introduced. Another method comprises placing a hair growth promoting composition containing a carbonate such as sodium hydrogencarbonate, to which is added a pH adjuster thereby generating carbon and the container is immediately sealed tightly. A further method makes use of dry ice pellets for generating carbon dioxide. Of these, the method using high pressure gas is preferred. By this, part of carbon dioxide is dissolved in the hair growth promoting composition and part thereof is present as a gas in the container. In the practice of the invention, it is important that carbon dioxide be dissolved and incorporated in the hair growth promoting composition. The amount of the incorporated carbon dioxide is preferably over 60 ppm. Less amounts are unfavorable because satisfactory vasodilative action cannot be expected. The amount of carbon dioxide may be controlled depending on the charge of incorporated carbon dioxide charged under pressure . In general, it is preferred that the pressure in the container is in the range of 1.2 to 8 kg cm2 G at a temperature of 350C. The pressure resistant container used in the practice of the invention should be a container which can withstand the above defined pressure for a period of from tight sealing till use in order to keep the hair growth promoting composition in a sealed condition.Examples of such container include metal containers such as aluminium, tin and the like, resin containers such as acetal resins, polycarbonate resins and the like, and glass containers. The container has a discharge nozzle. If a diameter of the discharge nozzle is small, the filling liquid is sprayed as mist, whereas if the diameter is large, the liquid is sprayed as foams or droplets. As a matter of course, the spraying state may differ depending on the inner pressure of the ccntainer. With known aerosol sprayers, the discharge nozzle thereof has a diameter of below 0.3 mm. If such a discharge nozzle is applied to the hair growth prom ing position of the present invention, satisfactory results cannot be obtained because the filling liquid is sprayed in the form of mist and carbon dioxide is immediately lost from the liquid. To avoid this, it is nee sary to keep a long residence time of carbon dioxide in hair growth promoting composition.In this sense, it is preferable to apply the composition directly on the scalp in the form of foams or droplets while permitting the hair growth promoting composition to be deposited on the hair only in amounts as small as possible. upon the application, it becomes possible to generate carbon dioxide on the scalp. For the purposes, the discharge nozzle is preferred to have a diameter of 0.3 to 1.5 mm and a length of 1 to 15 cm.In order to prevent reduction in amount of dissolved carbon dioxide and maintain a constant spraying condition, it is favorable to use an aerosol injector as disclosed in JapaneseLaid open Application No. 57 153752 in which a miniature bomb of carbon dioxide is built in a container, by which when a pressure of carbon dioxide lowers, fresh carbon dioxide can be supplied to keep a constant concentration of carbon dioxide constant from an initial stage of use till completion. Aside from the above described essential ingredients, the hair growth promoting composition of the invention. may further comprise other ingredients used in ordinary cosmetics such as oil substrates, emolients, gelling agents, various emulsifiers, perfumes, preservatives such as parahydroxybenzoates, antioxidants such as butyl hydroxyanisole, colorants such as dyes, refrigerants such as menthol, bactericides, iiulaectants such as propylene glycol, and the lik. As described above, the hair growth promoting composition of the present invention which comprises blood flow increasing agents and or hair matrix cell activators, and carbon dioxide serves to increase the blood flow within a short time and retain the increase of the blood flow to an extent. The blood flow increasing agents and or hair matrix cell activators can be efficiently arrived at matrix cells of the hair. As a result, good effect of preventing falling off of hair is attained. Use of carbon dioxide enables stimulative blood flow increasing agents and or hair matrix cell activators to be reduced in amounts, leading to the possibility of continuous application of the hair growth promoting composition with the expectation of more improved effects.Moreover, upon gasification of carbon dioxide dissolved in the hair growth promoting composition, agreeable stimulativeness and a kind of massage are given to the scalp. Because the hair growth promoting composition itself is weakly acidic and is thus close to the human skin in pH, favorable influences on the skin can be expected. The present invention is particularly illustrated by way of examples.Reference 1 The hair of each of C3H mice male on the back skin at the resting stage thereof was cut so that no damage was given to the back skin. The state of growth of the hair at a subsequent growing stage was observed. Sites where the growth of the hair on the skin surface was observed were checked as a function of time. A ratio, r, of an area of the sites to an area of the cut portion was calculated. The results are shown in Table 1.
