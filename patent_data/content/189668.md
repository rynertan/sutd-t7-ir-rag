A one gallon reactor was charged with 1681g of styrene, 405g of dibromostyrene Great Lakes Dibromostyrene and 3.62g of benzoyl peroxide. The reactor contents were heated to 80 C, at which time a solution of 248.4g of maleic anhydirde in 1019g of styrene was added over a three hour period. The polymerization was allowed to proceed for an additional 30 minutes. The resulting copolymer was precipitated from methanol, filtered, washed with methanol and dried under vacuum.

UL 94, third edition January 24, 1980 . In this UL 94 Vertical Burning Test, the molded blend test specimen was supported from the upper end, with the longest dimension vertical, by a clamp on a ring stand so that the lower end of the specimen was 1 above the top of the burner tube. The burner was then placed remote from the sample, ignited, and adjusted to produce a blue flame 1 in height. The test flame was placed centrally under the lower end of the test specimen and allowed to remain for 10 seconds. The test flame was then withdrawn, and the duration of flaming or glowing combustion of the specimen was noted. If flaming or glowing combustion of the specimen ceased within 30 seconds after removal of the test flame, the test flame was again placed under the specimen for 10 seconds immediately after flaming or glowing combustion of the specimen stopped. The test flame was again withdrawn, and the duration of flaming or glowing combustion of the specimen was noted. It the specimen dripped flaming particles or droplets while burning in this test, these drippings were allowed to fall onto a horizontal layer of cotton fibers untreated surgical cotton placed one foot below the test specimen. Significantly flaming particles were considered to be those capable of igniting the cotton fibers. The duration of flaming or glowing combustion of vertical specimens after application of the test flame average of 5 specimens with 10 flame applications should not exceed 25 seconds maximum not more than 30 seconds and the portion of the specimen outside the clamp should not be completely burned in the test. Materials which comply with the above requirements and do not drip any flaming particles or droplets during the burning test are classified as V 1 . Materials which comply with the above requirement but drip flaming particles or droplets which burned briefly during the test are classified as V 2 . A V 0 rating is given to materials wherein the duration of flaming or glowing combustion averages less than 5 seconds under the conditions specified above. The results of the UL 94 testing was as follows It will be evident from the foregoing that various modifications can be made to this invention. Such, however, are considered as being within the scope of the invention.
