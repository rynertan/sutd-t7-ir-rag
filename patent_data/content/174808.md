# Electromagnetic actuator.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic actuator is composed of a fixed body 2 made up of magnetic yokes 10, 11, 12 carrying electrical coils 7, 8, 9 and a lightweight movable body 3 in the form of a hollow cylinder disposed axially inside or outside the fixed body. The movable body is composed of cylindrical magnets 22a 22c interposed with non magnetic disk 23a 23c to decrease the effect of eddy currents flowing in the movable body due to electromagnetic induc tion. The coils 7, 8, 9 are connected in parallel to increase the magnetic force acting on the movable body 3 .
