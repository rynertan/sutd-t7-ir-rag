# Diffused light lighting device.

## Abstract
A lighting device operable with solar beams propagating through and emitting from the optical wave guides 2 . A pair of spaced concave and convex reflecting members 4,11 are provided to effectively diffuse the solar beams issuing from the exit end 3 of the optical wave guides. One of the reflecting members may be constituted by a mirrored electric bulb in order to ensure the lighting device to operate also by electric power.
