# Connector for electrically interconnecting a panel system and a panel system incorporating the connector.

## Abstract
Adjacent room divider panels 2 have raceways 3 which are joined by a connector 4 through which hard wir ing 5 can pass. The connector has a split body comprised of two nesting U shaped members 84, 85 to enable the con nector to be opened so that the wires can be laid in the interior cavity, the outer shell being closed about the wires, and the connector includes opposed open ends which com municate with the adjacent raceways, whereby the raceways and channels form an uninterrupted shield for the wires, so as economically to hard wire the panels by hand without requiring a conventional conduit type of installation.
