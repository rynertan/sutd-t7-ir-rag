# Supported, Mn sulfide promoted Mo and W sulfide hydroprocessing catalysts and uses thereof.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the preparation and use of supported, manganese sulfide promoted molybdenum and tungsten sulfide catalysts useful for hydroprocessing proces ses, particularly hydrotreating. These catalysts are prepared by heating a composite of support material and precursor salt under oxygen free conditions and in the presence of sulfur, wherein said precursor salt contains a thiometallate anion of Mo, W or mixture thereof and a cation comprising one or more promoter metals which are chelated by at least one neutral, nitrogen containing polydentate ligand, and wherein said promoter metal comprises Mn alone or a mixture of Mn with Co, Ni, Zn, Cu or mixture thereof.
