# SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING LINE TRACKING.

## Abstract
A system for controlling line tracking, in which a robot 51 works in cooperation with the movement of a transport device 50 . The moving speed of the transport device 50 is set to be constant, a correction amount d is found relying upon the moving speed which has been set to be constant, a boundary value B of the moving speed of the transport device 50 is found, the boundary value is compared with a real speed of the transport device 50 , and the correction amount d is added or subtracted based upon the compared result, in order to find an instruction value for the robot.
