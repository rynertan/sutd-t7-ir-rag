# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ACYLOXY AROMATIC CARBOXYLIC ACID

## Abstract
Acyloxy aromatic carboxylic acids, e.g., 4 acetoxybenzoic acid, are prepared by oxidizing with oxygen an acyloxy aromatic ketone, e.g., 4 acetoxyacetophenone in the presence of transition metal ions as catalyst and a co reductant. The acyloxy aromatic ketone may be prepared by acylating a hydroxy aromatic ketone, e.g., 4 hydroxyacetophenone, which has the effect of masking the hydroxyl group of the ketone in a manner necessary to effect the subsequent transition metal catalyzed oxidation of the ketone to the acyloxy aromatic carboxyic acid.
