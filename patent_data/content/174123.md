# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ALKYLFURANS

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of alkylfurans comprising reacting furan with an alkene in the presence of a supported phosphoric acid catalyst wherein the alkene has from 4 to 20 carbon atoms and is a branched chain alkene which is a 1,1 disubstituted ethene or a tri or tetra substituted ethene and the molar ratio of furan to alkene is at least 1 1. The catalyst is supported on a silica containing support which is preferably manufactured silica or a naturally occurring silicaceous composition e.g. kieselguhr. The alkylfurans may be used as a gasoline additive.
