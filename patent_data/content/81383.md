# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO HONING

## Abstract
A honing machine uses a honing tool of the type having two honing surfaces and a core for adjusting the lateral positions of the surface relative to the tool body. The machine has a piston feed mechanism for adjusting the honing diameter of the tool, a drive mechanism for rotationally driving the tool and a stroke mechanism for axially reciprocating the tool to effect a honing stroke. A control system monitors the position and velocity of the feed piston of the feed mechanism and reaction force applied to the feed piston by contact with a workpiece and in dependence thereon controls the operation of the mechanism in a preselected manner.
