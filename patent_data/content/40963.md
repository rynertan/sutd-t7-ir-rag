# Plasmid.

## Abstract
A novel plasmid pUC1021 has been constructed from Bacillus megaterium chromosomal DNA and plasmid pBR322. Hybrid plasmid pUC1021 contains a functional tet gene promoter, and is therefore useful as a cloning vehicle in recombinant DNA work. Using well known DNA methodology, the insulin gene, for example, can be inserted into pUC1021 and the resulting plasmid can then be transformed into a suitable host microbe which, in culture, can produce insulin.
