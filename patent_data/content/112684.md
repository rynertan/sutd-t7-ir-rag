# Improved tray for liquid contacting in an extraction zone.

## Abstract
An improve tray means 30, 40, 50 and an extraction zone 10 utilizing the tray means 30, 40, 50 are disclosed. The tray means 30, 40, 50 comprises a tray deck, 34, 44, 55 , a channel means 37, 47, 57 , ans a weir means 38, 48, 58 . The tray deck 34, 44, 54 , and channel means 37, 47, 57 , cooperate to form a fluid conduit 36, 46, 56 , through which fluid flows from beneath the tray deck 34, 44, 54 , to the weir means 38, 48, 58 . The tray means 30, 40, 50 , is useful in cross flow liquid liquid extraction zones 10 , with particular applicability to extractive purification of lube oils.
