# Improved method for the production of high fructose corn syrup.

## Abstract
The preparation of high fructose corn syrup wherein the glucose containing process stream is sequentially contacted with a strong acid cation exchange resin and then a weak base anion exchange resin prior to enzyme isomerization of the glucose to fructose is facilitated by treating the process stream with a weak acid cation exchange resin subsequent to its treatment with the strong acid and weak base resins but prior to enzyme isomerization.
