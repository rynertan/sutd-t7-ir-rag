# METHOD OF MEASURING CONTACT STRESS OF CONTACTING SOLID SURFACES WITH ULTRASONIC WAVES.

## Abstract
Method of measuring the contact stress at the contacting surface 4 of solids of the same or different type by utilizing ultrasonic waves, which comprises the steps of introducing the ultrasonic waves into the contacting surfaces 4 , com paring the sound pressure of the waves reflected from the contacting surface 4 with that of waves transmitted through the contacting surface 4 , and measuring the contact stress using the compared value as an evaluation index, thereby simply, non destructively, quantitatively and accurately measuring the contact stress of the contacting surfaces of parts or members forming a machine or the like in static and dynamic states.
