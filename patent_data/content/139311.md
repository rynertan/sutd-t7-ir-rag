# Method for the manufacture of a magnesia carbon brick, and a converter having a wear lining at least partly of such bricks.

## Abstract
A method for the manufacture of a magnesia carbon brick comprising the steps of a. preparing a mixture comprising 1. burned magnesite 2. carbon 3. binder solution comprising 3.1 precondensed novolak resin 3.2 solvent for the novolak resin 4. a hardener for the resin b. pressing a brick from the said mixture In order to improve the wearing quality of the brick and to reduce the tendency of the brick to crack, the mixture is prepared at an elevated temperature in the range of 30 to 100 C, and in the binder solution the percentage by weight of the solvent relative to the weight of novolak resin and solvent together is in the range 5 to 30 .
