# Method for producing powder of alpha silicon nitride.

## Abstract
A method for producing powder of α silicon nitride which comprises the steps of adding 0.3 to 2 parts by weight of powder of carbon and 0.005 to 1 part by weight of at least one silicon compound se lected from the group consisting of Si₃N₄, SiC and silicon oxide nitride series compounds to one part by weight as converted to SiO₂ of a liquid silane derivative which produces a precipi tate and HCl by hydrolysis and further causes SiO₂ to be grown by the baking of said precipitate, or the precipitate produced by hydrolysis of the liquid silane derivatives hydrolyzing the resultant mixture, if necessary washing the mixture to separate a solid component, if necessary and baking the solid component for reduction and nitrogeni zation at a temperature of 1300 to 1500 C in an atmosphere mainly consisting of a nitrogen gas or a gas of a nitrogen com pound.
