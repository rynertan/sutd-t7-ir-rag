# Impact resistant resin composition and a product produced from it.

## Abstract
An impact resistant resin composition comprising a graft polymer in which an aromatic alkenyl compound and an alkenyl cyanide compound are grafted onto a rubbery polymer and a matrix comprising a copolymer of an aromatic alkenyl compound and an alkenyl cyanide com pound can have improved vacuum formability and the moulded articles prepared by vacuum forming the composi tion can have smaller variations in thickness from point to point and a smaller reduction in strength due to contact with foamed polyurethane by ensuring that the following condi tions are met a the proportion of rubber polymer in the composition is from 10 to 30 by weight b the graft polymer has a degree of grafting of from 70 to 120 by weight c the matrix has an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.55 to 0.80 dl g, measured at 30 C in methyl ethyl ketone and d the weight ratio of the aromatic alkenyl compound to the alkenyl cyanide compound in the composition is from 2.0 1 to 2.8 1. Incorporation in the composition of from 0.01 to 2 by weight of a diorganopolysiloxane having a viscosity of from 5 to 100,000 centistokes at 25 C and or from 0.1 to 3 by weight of a metal salt of a fatty acid improves the ability of the composition to maintain its strength upon contact with foamed polyurethane. The resulting composition is of value in forming the box body of a refrigerator.
