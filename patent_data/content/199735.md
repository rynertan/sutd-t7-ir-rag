## Description
The present invention relates to a disinfectant and cleansing composition. More particularly, the present invention relates to a composition which is effective for disinfecting i.e., destroying harmful microorganisms and cleansing, for example, animate objects and surfaces. In one preferred embodiment, the composition of the present invention is useful in disinfecting and cleansing animal tissue such as the human skin while, at the same time, significantly reducing pain and itching without causing irritation or other harmful effects on the skin. Alkali metal salts of hydroxy alkyl amine substituted carboxylic acids are known as chelating agents useful, for example, for the chelating of iron in metal cleaning. However, chelating agents in general have been believed to be ineffective antibacterial agents. Moreover, due to the high pH of commercially available solutions of the alkali metal salts of hydroxy alkyl amine substituted carboxylic acids, generally in the neighbourhood of 13 14, it has been believed that they would be harmful and even destructive to animal tissue, e.g., human skin. Conventional anionic surface active agents are known as excellent cleansing agents. However, the anionic surface active agents are also known as tending to irritate animal tissue, e.g., the human skin, by interaction with the protein of the tissue. Moreover, the conventional anionic surface active agents have at most only a very slight bactericidal action and have been taught as destroying the bactericidal action of known bactericides such as the cationic surface active agents. FR A 21 23 332 discloses detergent compositions containing as primary active ingredient an alkali metal salt of mono or bis hydroxyalkyl amine substituted carboxylic acids and a surface active agent in a proportion range of from 1 2 up to 10 1. Dishwashing detergents containing N,N bis hydroxyalkyl β alanine Ma salt and alkyl ether sulfates, soaps, alkyl benzenesulfonates, paraffinsulfonates, olefinsulfonates, poly oxyethylene alkyl ether sulfonates, or higher alc. sulfates are disclosed in JP A 77 154811. JP A 80 151098 discloses dishwashing detergents containing metal salts of N β hydroxyalkyl N hydroxyethyl β alanine and anionic surfactants. JP A 81 11998 discloses color safe peroxide bleaches containing N 2 hydroxyethyl aminoacetic acid I , its Na salt, or Mg N,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl aminoacetate. It is the object of the present invention to provide a disinfectant and cleansing composition which is effective for destroying harmful microorganisms on, for example, animate objects and surfaces without causing irritation or other harmful effects and also effective in reducing pain and itching. Surprisingly, it has now been found according to the present invention that a composition containing,, as primary active ingredient sodium dihydroxyethyl glycinate is effective in fulfilling the above objects. In another preferred embodiment, it has been found that a combination of a major proportion of the sodium dihydroxyethyl glycinate with a minor proportion of an anionic surface active agent produces a disinfectant and cleansing composition which may exhibit a synergistic effect in fulfilling the above objects. The preferred composition of this embodiment is characterized in that it contains as the active components said sodium dihydroxyethyl glycinate and said anionic surface active agent. It is important to expose the sodium dihydroxyethyl glycinate to the atmosphere at ambient or slightly elevated temperatures to allow volatilization of any unreacted starting materials, e.g., amines. The subject matter of the invention therefore is a disinfectant and cleansing composition consisting essentially of an aqueous solution comprising sodium dihydroxyethyl glycinate in an amount of 0.001 to 50 by weight, wherein said compound has been pretreated to remove unreacted amines by volatilization, and, preferably, wherein the aqueous solution has a pH of 8 to 14. A particularly suitable anionic surface active agent is sodium diisobutyl naphthalene sulfonate and others which may be used include sulfated and sulfonated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and sulfated and sulfonated esters, amides and alcohols. Both of the sodium dihydroxyethyl glycinate and the anionic surface active agents are known compounds and may be produced in manners known to the art. The composition of the present invention contains from 0.001 to 50 by weight of the active ingredient, i.e. the sodium dihydroxyethyl glycinate, which is available e.g. as Hampshire DEG W. R. Grace Co. commercially in solutions containing 46 48 of the salt. For certain purposes, the commercial product may be further concentrated, e.g., by removal of small portions of the solvent by evaporation or other conventional methods, to above about 47 by weight, for example, for up to about 50 by weight or slightly higher of the active ingredient, although this is not ordinarily necessary. The composition may also be diluted by addition of solvent or other inactive carrier. For most external applications, the composition will contain at least about 4 5 by weight of the active ingredient. For the compositions of the present invention also containing the anionic surfactant, the proportions of active ingredients correspond to from 1 to 9 parts, preferably about 9 parts, by tight of a 40 by weight solution of the anionic surface active agent combined with each part of a 46 48 by weight solution of the sodium glycinate component. It is to be understood that these proportions may be accomplished in a variety of manners known to the art. Thus, the strengths of the solutions may be varied or the anionic surface active agent may be added in the solid form to the solution of the sodium glycinate component, so long as the final proportions are within the above limitations. Increasing the proportion of anionic surface active agent above about 9 parts by weight may undesirably result in overdrying of animal tissue and perhaps a tendency to irritation. The solutions of the active components are aqueous solutions, most preferably solutions in deionized water. Other solutions which may be used include those in distilled water. As discussed hereinbefore, the pH of the alkali metal component in, for example, a 46 48 by weight solution is about 13 to 14. Normally, compositions having a pH above about 8 tend to be destructive or otherwise detrimental to animal tissue and this effect normally increases with an increase in the pH. It has been unexpectedly and surprisingly found, however, that the sodium dihydroxyethyl glycinate used in the composition of the present invention is not harmful to animal tissue. While the addition of the anionic surface active agent in the compositions containing same does not significantly reduce the pH of the combination, surprisingly the composition is even less detrimental to animal tissue. The composition of the present invention is a most effective disinfectant. That is, it will eliminate or at least significantly reduce and control harmful microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, etc. The high pH also is effective in reducing pain, e.g., from burns, perhaps by the production of heat upon contact with the animal tissue. The composition of the present invention is absorbed rapidly by and into animal tissue such as the human skin. It has been found that the composition is also effective for application to the teats of milk cows to cleanse and disinfect the teats while preventing irritation thereof. It is believed that the composition of the present invention which contains the anionic surfactant may exhibit a two way synergistic safety characteristic. That is, the anionic surface active agent operates synergistically to significantly reduce or eliminate any possible irritating effects resulting from the high pH of the sodium dihydroxyethyl glycinate and said sodium dihydroxyethyl glycinate in turn, may operate synergistically to significantly reduce or eliminate any harmful effect of the anionic surface agent such as its known tendency to irritate animal tissue such as the human skin. Most significantly, the two components interact synergistically to provide an effective disinfectant composition useful to eliminating all harmful microorganisms from, for example, animate objects and surfaces. For purposes of the present invention, the term animate is to be understood in its broad sense, i.e., referring to objects and surfaces possessing, or having possessed, life. It is believed, however, that the composition of the present invention may also find use in disinfecting objects and surfaces such as the shells of eggs and as bactericides and or insecticides. If desired, the normally high pH of the composition can be reduced by addition of a non toxic acid, e.g., acetic acid or citric acid. The pH of the composition can be lowered to about 4 with citric acid and to about 3 with acetic acid. It has been surprisingly found that even with lowering of the pH, the composition is still effective although the effect may be retarded somewhat. For example, at a pH of 8, the composition is still an effective disinfectant and still effectively reduces pain and itching. The composition of the present invention may be diluted with a carrier, e.g., deionized water, for various purposes. For example, the composition of the present invention containing from 0.001 to 5 parts by weight of the active ingredient or ingredients may be ingested orally or given intraperitoneally to animals. The composition may also be concentrated for other purposes, e.g., by volatilization of a portion of the carrier. Other ingredients may be added to the composition as desired including dyes, pigments, perfumes, etc. up to a total of about 10 by weight. Also, for application to animal tissue such as the human skin, the composition may contain constituents normally present in preparations for this purpose such as emulsifiers, fatty substances, plant extracts, preservatives and solvents in the customary amounts. Thus, the compositions of the present invention may contain any such constituents which are at least miscible with the carrier or solvent, will not be irritating to animal tissue either alone or in combination with the active ingredient or ingredients, and will not materially affect the pH of the composition. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise defined. A composition was prepared containing 47 by weight of sodium dihydroxy ethyl glycinate in water. The composition of Example 1 was diluted with 30 parts by weight of water. 9 Parts of a 46 48 by weight aqueous solution of sodium dihydroxy ethyl glycinate was admixed with stirring with 1 part of a 40 by weight aqueous solution of sodium diisobutyl naphthalene sulfonate. The composition prepared according to Example 3 was diluted with 20 parts by weight of deionized water. The composition prepared according to Example 3 was concentrated by heating to evaporate the aqueous carrier until the solution contained about 50 parts by weight of active ingredients.
