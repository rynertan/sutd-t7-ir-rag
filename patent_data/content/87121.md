# Noise reduction device for stationary induction apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a noise reduction device for a stationary induction apparatus which device comprises a sound insula tion panel 5 attached to reinforcing channels 3 provided at the periphery of a tank 1 of the stationary induction apparatus so as to block noises emitted from the outer surface of the tank 1 , a weighty body 6 attached to the sound insulation panel 5 for reducing vibrations of the sound insulation panel 5 and a dynamic damper 11 of which the natural frequency can be adjusted to be made equal to the vibration frequency of the weighty body 6 so as to cancel the vibrations of the weighty body 6 .
