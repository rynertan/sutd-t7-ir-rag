# Improvements relating to phase detecting apparatus for use in synchronising systems.

## Abstract
A phase detecting arrangement for use in a frequency and phase synchronising system, said arrangement com prises a phase detector having an inherent delay charac teristic and arranged to produce alternate logic 1 and logic 0 outputs in response to the arrival at respective phase detec tor inputs of set and re set pulse transitions occurring in pulse trains derived, respectively, from external synchro nising signal generating means and signal source means the frequency of which is to be synchronised with that of the synchronising signal, in which first and second sampling devices are associated with the phase detector for directly or indirectly sampling the output from the detector when set and re set transitions occur, respectively, at inputs to the first and second sampling devices and in which outputs from the sampling devices are suitably gated to produce an overall logic 1 or logic 0 output from the arrangement whereby an existing output i.e. logic 1 or logic 0 from the arrangement is perpetuated when the phase detector output sampled indicates that at least two consecutive set or re set pulse transitions have occurred without the intervention of an opposite type transition i.e. re set or set .
