# Improved electronic component transporter wheel.

## Abstract
A machine for use in shaping the leads 58,60 of electronic components 50 of the type having a main body portion 52 and a lead 58,60 projecting from opposite ends of the main body portion 52 , the machine having a component transporter 10 for transporting components 50 from a loading station to a lead forming station. The component transporter 10 comprises a pair of discs 12 each having a resiliently flexible peripheral edge portion 14 , a plurality of lead receiving notches 26 extending radially inwardly from the peripheral edge 16 of each disc 12 at circumferentially spaced intervals. A plurality of edge separ ation slots 28 extending inwardly from the peripheral edge 16 of each disc 12 , one on either side of each receiving notch 26 thereby subdividing the peripheral edge portion 14 into a plurality of independently flexible segments 32 . The discs 12 are mounted for rotation about a common axis in a spaced relationship to form an open gap 48 therebe tween which extends inwardly from the peripheral edge thereof. The discs 12 are arranged with the lead receiving notches 26 of one disc aligned with the lead receiving notches 26 of the other disc. Magnets 70 are provided to deflect successive opposed segments 32 laterally away from one another during passage through the loading station to widen the gap 48 between the segments to receive the body 52 of a component 50 therebetween and thereafter permit the successive opposed segments 32 to move toward one another to clamp the body 52 of a component 50 therebetween with its leads 56,60 project ing through the notches 26 .
