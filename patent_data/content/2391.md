# Crash bottom carton and blank therefor.

## Abstract
A crash bottom carton is erected from a flattened tubular condition to a generally rectangular condition. At the same time, bottom forming panels 26, 28 hinged to its wall forming panels 10, 12, 14, 16 are automatically brought down into a co planar configuration at the bottom of the carton, and a pair of first partition forming panels 46, 82 pass over a pair of second partition forming panels 30, 72 . The partition forming panels have co operating slots or notches 56, 50, 76, 90 which enable them to receive each other in a crosswise configuration after they have passed over each other this happens automatically as the carton is brought into the rectangular configuration.

## Description
CRCSH BOTTOM CARTON3 AND BLLsis THEREFOR This invention relates to crash bottom cartons and blanks therefor. Crash bottom cartons comprise an array of four wall panels hinged one to the next, the ends of the array being joined together to form a flattenable tubular arrangement of the wall panels with two panels on one side and two panels on the opposite side of the flattened tube, bottom forming panels being hinged to the wall panels and arranged so that when the wall panels are moved from the flattened configuration te the rectangular tubular configuration the bottom forming panels automatically move into a co planar configuration at the bottom of the erected carton. It is known to provide subsidiary panels on the edges of the bottom forming panels, which subsidiary panels provide partitions within the carton.With previously known crash bottom cartons, it has only been possible to provide square compartments by such partitions, if the carton is to be erectable from its flattened condition automatically. Cartons are known in which rectangular compartments are provided, but such cartons cannot easily be erected by machine. Cartons according to the present invention may have rectangular compartments and are easier to erect. According to the present invention there is provided a crash bottom carton in which first and second bottom forming panels have hinged thereto respectively first and second partition forming panels1 at least one of the partition forming panels being shaped to provide a notch or slot to receive the other crosswise on erection of the carton from the flattened condition, the first partition forming panel having a portion which on erection passes over that edge of the second par ition forming panel which is remote from its bottom forming panel to bring the partition forming panels in the crosswise configuration. In one form, the distance from the hinge between the second wall forming panel and the second bottom forming panel to said edge of the second partition forming panel is preferably less than or equal to the distance from the corresponding hinge of the first bottom forming panel to the closest edge of said portion of the first partition forming panel, which passes over said edge of the second partition forming panel. In other form, said portion is hingeable to enable it to pass over said edge. Preferably each partition forming panel has a notch or slot, the notches or slots co operating with each other. Preferably the said edges of the two partition forming panels have lead in portions to the slots which are shaped to direct the partition forming panels into the crosswise configuration. The invention also encompasses a blank of foldable sheet material for such a carton. Two preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig.1 is a plan of a blank for forming a first carton, Fig. 2 shows the carton in a flattened condition prior to erection, Fig.3 is a view of part of the interior of the carton during erection,. Fig.4 shows the erected carton, Fig.5 is a plan of a blank for forming a second carton, Fig. shows the second carton in a flatta condition prior to erection, Fig.7 is a view of part of the interior of the second carton during erection, and Fig. 8 shows the second carton when erecte Referring firstly to Fig.1, the blank for first carton is cut and scored from foldable boaru material and has four side wall forming panels 10,12,r These panels are arranged in a longitudinal row.At n end of the row, the panel 16 has a tab 18 which, on forming the carton into the flattened condition shown Fig.2, is adhered to the panel 10 at the other end of the row, so that the flattened carton of Fig.2 is essentially tubular. All the panels 10,12,14,16 are rectangular, being hinged together by their shorter edges. The panel 10 has a lid forming panel 20 hinged to one of its longer edges, the panel 20 having a tuck in flap 22 hinged to its edge opposite the panel 10. The panels 12,16 also have flaps 24 hinged to their longer edges on the same side as the lid 20. On their longer edges opposite the lid 20 a flaps 24, each of the panels 10,12,14,16 has a bottom forming panel 26,28. The panels 28 hinged to the side wall forming panels 12,16 are roughly rectangular, and to their edges remote from the side wall forming panels are hinged respective partitionforming panels 30.The bottom forming panels 26 are hinged at 40 to the side wall forming panels 10,14 an are of approximately the same depth measured away from the hinge 40 as the panels 28 and 3Q taken to.ether. One edge 32 of the panel 26 tamers niagonally, and in the carton when erected this edge 32 lies on a diagonal of one of the rectangular compare ments. The opposite edge of the panel 26 has a flap 34 connected thereto by a hinge line 36 which is at 450 to the hinge line between the panels 26 and 10 or 14. This hinge line 36 is scored and perforated such that the flap 34 hinge s downwardly from the panel 26 that is, in the opposite sense to all the other hinge and fold lines of the blank .At the outer end of the hinge line 36, the edge 38 of the panel 26 is nearly perpendicular to the hinge line 40. The edge 38 extends as a small cut 42 in the blank between the flap 34 and panel 26, to meet the hinge line 36. At its edge 44 remote from the hinge 40, each panel 26 is hinged to a partition forming panel 46.The panel 46 has a laterally extending portion 48, and a notch 50 is formed which partially divides the portion 48 from the rest of the panel 46. The notch 50 extends from the edge 52 of the portion 48 which is closest to the hinge 40. The edge 52 has a cam shaped recess 54 which provides a lead in to the notch 50. Each partition forming panel 30 has a notch 56 which co operates with the notch 50 when the carton is erected. The panel 30 has an upper edge which is cam shaped at 58 to lead in to the notch 56. Each panel 30 also has a C shaped cut 60 leading into the panel 30 from the hinge 62 between the panels 30 and 28, to form a ledge 64 extending out of the panel 28.There is also m line of weakening 66 extending at an angle between the notch 56 and the cut 60 so that one half 68 of the panel 30 can flex to a limited extent with respect to the other half 70. The blank is folded into the collapsed, flat carton of Fig.2 by folding the bottom forming panels 26,28 over their respective wall forming panels 10,12,14,16, folding back the flaps 34, fo the panels 10 and 16 with their associated pane s over the panels 12 and 14, and adhering the tab 7e the inside of the panel 10 and the flaps 34 to t undersides ol the panels 28. The flattened collapsed carton shown inFig.2 can then be erected, for example by a machine, of the type disclosed in our German OLS No.2807968The carton is erected by pushing the two ends 72,74 towards each other. This causes the side walls 10,12,14,16 to assume a rectangular configuration, and as this happens the bottom forming panels 2, are pulled downwardly to form the bottom of the carton by the flaps 34 which are hinged about their 450 hinge lines 30,36 and adhered to the panels 28,As the panels 26,28are pulled downwardly, the partition forming panels 30,46 are taken insaraly, and the recess 54 meets the upper edge 59 of the nay 70 of the panel 30.The cam shapes of the recess and edge 59 guide the two notches 50,56 into engagemen with the partitions crosswise. This is seen particu ly in Fig.3, and the finally erected carton is seenFig.4 As the recess 54 follows the cam shape 58 one partition forming panel, the edge 38 causes the half 68 of the other partition forming panel to fl . Obviously, if the halves 70 flexed with the halves 8 they would hinder the proper engagement of the partitions. It is for this reason that the line c weakening 66 is provided so that the half 70 does not tend to flex with the half 68. When the carton is completely erected, the edge 38 of the panel 26 rests on the ledge 64 of tb panel 28. In additlon, the ledge 64 slots into the cut 42 as the panels 26,28 are being plled do nwardly. These two features give strength to the bottom of the cartcn when erected so that it can bear ite weight of goods contained in the carton, as does slso the fact that part of each penal 26s28 overlies ert of one of its neighbours. In their fully erected positions, the notches 50,56 engage each other securely, thus maintaining the carton in its erect condition. The erected carton thus has partitions defining six i.e. 2 x 3 rectangilar compartments into which goods can be packed. By suitable design of the blank, the compartments can be almost any rectangular shape, and for example could be square if desired. The carton could have a different number of compartments if desired for example a carton with four compartments 2 x 2 could be made by providing only one each of the panels 30 and 46. In the carton gust described, the partitions 46 are higher than the partitions 30. This is not essential, though it is desirable that the depth of the panel 26 measured from the hinge 40 is approximately the same as or greater than the corresponding depth of the panels 28 and 30 taken together, since this helps to ensure that the edge 52 passes over the edge 59 so that the notches 50,56 are brought into engagement. Referring now to Figs. 5 to 8 the second carton works on the same principle as the first, and in the drawings similar parts have like reference numbers, although their dimensions may be a little different. The flaps 24 have been separately identified as 24a and 24b. The major differences between the first carton and the second arise in the partition forming panels. The second carton when erected has partitions which form compartmens which are more nearly square than in the carton of Figs. 1 to 4 in fact the compartments of the second carton are only a few millimetres out of square. Instead of partition forming panels 30, the bottom forming panels 28 have partition form panels 72. The panels 72 have an upper edge74 having a notch 76. The notch 76 is barb like and has an abutment edge 78 and a lead in edge 80.The lead in edge 80 is cam shaped, like the cam shaped edge 58 in Figs 1 to 4 and functionin in a similar manner. The cut 60 and line of weakening 66 of Figs. 1 to 4 are not provided in the present embodiment. The bottom forming panels 26 have partitio forming panels 82 in place of the partition formit panels 46 of Figs. 1 to 4. These panels 82 have laterally extending portions 84, and the portion are provided with laps 86 which are hinged za 4 portions 84 about hinge lines 88 which are generall, parallel to the hinge lines 40. The flap 86 is vn that side of the line 88 closesc to the hinged i e The flap 86 defines a notch or slot 90 with t e g 92 of the panel 82. The opposite edge 94 of e panel 82 has a projecting portion 96. The flaps 86 have laterally extending any 98,100 respectively, the function of which ill s described later. The tab 100 is flexible in relati to its flap 86, by reason of a line of weakening 1These tabs 98, 100 and their function are novel n themselves, and may have application in other carv than crash bottom cartons. The carton is erected from the blank o cf to the flattened condition shown in Fig.6 in the manner as before, the flaps 34 being adhered to the pottom forming panels 28 as before. Xn addition, the ab 38 is flicked so that it lies on the other side o the panel 24a. Similarly, the ab 100 lies behind the flap 24t, but there is no need for a special l cking operation to achieve this .since the tab 100 will already be in place under the flap 24b when the tab 18 is adhered to the side wail forming panel 10. The carton is erected from the flattened condition in the same way as the carton of Figs.l to 4. It will be appreciated that initially the tabs 98, 100 are caught behind the flaps 24a,24b as the side walls 10,12,14,16 begin to assume a rectangular configuration. The purpose of this is to ensure that each flap 86 catches behind the edge of the corresponding panel 72, since otherwise the carton would tend not to erect properly. This is particularly tnie of the tab 98, since the corresponding panel 72 necessarily has a cut out portion 104 see Fig.5 corresponding to the tab 98. However, because the tab 100 occurs at the end of the blank there is no such cut cut portion on the other panel 72. It follows that it is not strictly necessary for the tab 100 to be booked behind the flap 24b, but it is easier to make the carton into the flattened condition of Fig.6 if this is so. The line of weakening 102 assists in disengaging the tab 100 from behind the flap 24b, this being more necessary than in the case of the tab 98 because of the presence of the adjacent lid panel 20. It will be seen from Fig.6 that each notch 76 is close to a corresponding projecting portion 96.As seen in Fig.7, when the side wall panels 10,12,14,16 are brought into their rectangular configuration, each projecting portoon 96 catches in is notch 76, and the abutment edge 78 bears against the projecting portion 96. This ensures that the panel 82 is pushed so that the flap 86 hinges upwardly and passes over the opposite panel 72. The flaps 86 are thus pushed over the upper edge 74 of the panel 72, down the cam shaped edge 80, and finally the flap 86 drops over the panel 72 to lock the partitions in place in the configuration seen inFig.8. In this erected configuration, the slot or notch 90 engages with the notch 76, and because the partitions are locked the entire carton is strong and secure. In use, cartons are supplied in the flat condition shown in Fig.2 or Fig.6 to the packer, who erects the carton which only requires one stroke and can be done automatically by a machine such as that described in our German OLS No.2807968 . He then inserts the goods e.g.glasses, which can go on their sides and are therefore presented in a more attractive displayj into the compartments. The flaps 24 or 24a and 24b are then folded in, and the lid closed by tucking the flap 22 into the carton next tp the side wal 14. Where glasses are being packed, preferably the partitions 30 or 72 are a little higher than hall the diameter of a glass.
