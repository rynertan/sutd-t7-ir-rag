# Radiation image read out by exposing a stimulable phosphor sheet.

## Abstract
In a radiation image read out system in which a stimul able phosphor sheet carrying a radiation image stored thereon is exposed to stimulating rays which causes it to emit light in the pattern of the stored image, and the emitted light is photoelectrically read out, the phosphor sheet is uniformly desensitized by the exposure thereof to stimulat ing rays. Then, preliminary read out is conducted by use of stimulating rays having stimulation energy lower than the stimulation energy of stimulating rays used in final read out, and the final read out conditions and the image processing conditions are set based on the image input information obtained by the preliminary read out. The desensitization is conducted to eliminate 3 to 60 of the radiation energy stored on the phosphor sheet in order to obtain the image input information suitable for setting the conditions regard less of the interval between the radiation image recording and the preliminary read out.
