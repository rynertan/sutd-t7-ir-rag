# UNIT WITH A SUBCUTANEOUS PICK UP FOR CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING PHYSIOLOGICAL CARDIORESPIRATORY VARIABLES

## Abstract
Unit for continuously monitoring and detecting varia tions in physiological cardiorespiratory variables, such as electrocardiogram signals QRS T , heart rate, ventilation mi nute VE , breathing rate, systolic output SO , cardiac output CO and arterial pressure AP . The said unit comprises a first subcutaneous part 1 having means 6, 9, 12 for detecting first physiological para meters, such as the difference in potential between elec trodes, transthoracic impedance and subcutaneous blood pressure, and means for handling first signals, depending on the said physiological parameters, and for transmitting them, by radio frequency, to a second part 18 outside the body the latter part having means for receiving the said physiological variables, which are then processed for detecting critical con ditions and activating alarm means 35, 36 .
