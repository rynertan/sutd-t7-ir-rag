# Dioxaphosphorinanes, their preparation and use for resolving optically active compounds.

## Abstract
New dioxcaphosphorinanes having the formula A process for the preparation of these dioxaphosphorinanes from a substituted 1 phenyl 1,3 dihydroxypropane by reacting this product with phosphoryl choride, the resolution of the diox aphosphorinanes in optical isomers by reacting with an optically active amino compound and the resolution of racemates of a plurality of amino compounds, such as hydroxyphenylglycine and phenylalanine, in optically active isomers by reacting with said dioxaphosphorinanes are described.
