# Control apparatus for a climate control system.

## Abstract
The loading of a variable capacity compressor in an air conditioning system is varied in accordance with evaporator pressure at return air temperatures above an upper set point and is fixed in the region of 33 when the return air temperature falls below the upper set point. The evaporator is coupled to the compressor and air is passed over it to remove heat from the air while evaporating working fluid, the pressure of the working fluid being detected by a switch 72 forming part of the compressor control circuit. The air temperature is monitored by thermostats 14, 12 responsive respectively to the upper set point and to a second lower set point, below which the compressor is shut down and heating apparatus is automatically and momentarily activated. The compressor is not activated again until the temperature rises above the upper set point. The heating is de activated as soon as the temperature rises above the lower set point.
