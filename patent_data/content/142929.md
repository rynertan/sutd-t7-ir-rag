## Description
DESCRIPTION WATER SOLUBLE POLYMERS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF. The present invention pertains to a composition and method of utilization of same to inhibit corrosion and control the formation and deposition of scale imparting compounds in water systems such as cooling and gas scrubbing systems. The problems of corrosion and scale formation and attendant effects have troubled water systems for years. For instance, scale tends to accumulate on internal walls of various water systems and thereby materially lessens the operational efficiency of the system. Corrosion, on the other hand, is a degradative electro chemical reaction of a metal with its environment. Simply stated, it is the reversion of refined metals to their natural state. For example, iron ore is iron oxide. Iron oxide is refined into steel. lçhen the steel corrodes, it forms iron oxide which1 if unattended, may result in failure or destruction of the metal, causing the particular water system to be shut down until the necessary repairs can be made. Due to the recent popularity of cooling water treatment programs using high levels of orthophosphate to promote passivation of the metal surfaces in contact with the system water, it has become critically important to control calcium phosphate crystallization so that relatively high levels of orthophosphate may be maintained in the system to achieve the desired passivation without resulting in fouling or impeded heat transfer functions which would normally be caused by calcium phosphate deposition. Additionally, in certain highly alkaline water systems, calcium phosphonate precipitation has become a problem when phosphonic acid compounds have been used as part of the treatment approach to inhibit calcium carbonate deposition. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, it has been surprisingly discovered that water soluble copolymers, as shown in Formula I hereinafter, are effective in controlling the formation of calcium phosphate, and calcium phosphonate deposits and in inhibiting corrosion in various water systems. When the polymer is conjointly used with a water soluble orthophosphate compound, the metal surfaces in contact with the system water are passivated and therefore corrosion is inhibited without resulting in substantial deposition of scale thereon. The water soluble copolymers used in the present invention have the structure FORMULA IEMI3.1 wherein R1 is H or lower alkyl C1 6 R2 is OH or OM, or NH2 t4 is a water soluble cation R3 is a hydroxy substituted alkyl or alkylene radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a non substituted alkyl or alkylene radical having from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms X, when present, is an anionic radical selected from the group consisting of S03, P03, Pro4, and COO Z, when present, is H or hydrogens or any water soluble cation or cations which together counterbalance the valence of the anionic radical a is O or 1. The number average molecular weight of the water soluble copolymers of FORMULA I may fall within the range of 1,000 to 1,000,000. Preferably the number average molecular weight will be within the range of from about 1,500 to 500,000, with the range of about 1,500 to about 10,000 being even more highly desirable. The key criterion is that the polymer be water soluble. The molar ratio x y of the monomers of FORMULA I nay fall within the range of between about 30 1 to 1 20, with the x y molar ratio range of from about 10 1 to 1 5 being preferred. At present, the water soluble polymer preferred for use in cooling water systems is FORMULA IIEMI4.1 wherein M is the same as given in FORMULA I. This polymer FORMULA II is referred to as acrylic acid allyl hydroxy propyl sulfonate ether AA AHPSE . The IUPAC nomenclature for AHPSE is l propane sulfonic acid, 2 hydroxy 3 2 propenyl oxy mono sodium salt. With respect to both repeat units of the polymers of the present invention, they may exist in acid or water soluble salt form when used in the desired water system. As to preparation of the monomer designated as x above, in FORMULA I, acrylic acid is well known. It may be produced by hydrolysis of acrylonitrile or via oxidation of acrolein. Other well known vinyl containing monomers such as methacrylic acid and acrylamide may also be utilized as monomer x of FORMULA I in accordance with the invention. Turning to the allyl containing monomer, monomer y, in the FORMULA I above, these may be produced by reacting allyl alcohol with a non tertiary alcohol in the temperature range of about 25 150 C as is detailed in U.S. Patent 2,847,477 the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference followed by, if desired, sulfonation, phosphorylation, phosphona tion or carboxylation of the monomer via well known techniques. The preferred allyl hydroxy propyl sulfonate ether monomers monomer y FORi4ULA II may conveniently be prepared via a ring opening reaction of the epoxy group of an allyl glycidyl ether precursor. Sulfonation of the epoxy group with sodium sulfite in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst such as tetra n butylammonium bisulfite or with fuming sulfuric acid containing sulfur trioxide will produce the sulfonic acid group and hydroxy group of the AHPSE The resulting monomer can be further neutralized with caustic orother basic material. The reaction is illustrated by the following mechanism EMI5.1 Similar ring opening reactions can be carried out by using phosphorous acid and its derivatives including phosphorous trichloride to obtain the phosphonic acid substituents. If orthophosphoric acid H3P04 and its derivatives are used in the ring opening reaction, phosphoric acid ester substi tuents may be formed in accordance with the mechanism EMI6.1 Such reaction is described in U.S, Patent 2,723,971. Carboxylate functions can be provided on the allyl hydroxy propyl ether monomer via the reaction of allyl alcohol and chlorohydroxy butanoic acid according to the mechanism EMI6.2 It should be noted that the monomer y FORMULA I may itself be allyl glycidyl ether which is commercially available from several sources. Z in the allyl monomer, monomer y of FORMULA I if present, may be hydrogen, hydrogens or any soluble cation or cations which together counterbalance the valence of the anionic moiety X. Suitable cations include Na, NH4 , Ca, and K.X, when present, may be chosen from the group consisting of SO3, P03, P04, and COO. After the desired monomers have been obtained, free radical chain addition polyrnerization may proceed in accordance with conventional solution polymerization techniques. Polymerization initiators such as persulfate initiators, peroxide initiators, etc. may be used. Preferably the requisite monomers are mixed with water and alcohol preferably isopropanol . The resulting polymer may be isolated by well knosYn methods such as distillation, etc. or the polymer may simply be used in its aqueous solution. It should be mentioned that water soluble terpolymers comprising monomers x and y of FORMULAE I or II may also be prepared for use as deposit control agents and or corrosion control agents and are fully covered and described herein by use of the term copolymer. For instance, AHPSE monomers may be incorporated into a water soluble terpolymer backbone having other repeat units including acrylic acid monomers, alkyl acrylate monomers, hydroxylated lower alkyl acrylate C1 C6 monomers, methacrylic acid monomers, acrylamide monomers, etc.Such terpolymers may have a molar ratio of from about 30 1 to 1 20 non monomer y to monomer y repeat units see Formula 1 . The polymers should be added to the aqueous system, for which corrosion inhibiting, and or deposit control activity is desired, in an amount effective for the purpose. This amount will vary depending upon the particular system for which treatment is desired and will be influenced by factors such as, the area subject to corrosion, pH, temperature, water quantity and the respective concentrations in the water of the potential scale and deposit forming species. For the most part, the polymers will be effective when used at levels of about 0.1 500 parts per million parts of water, and preferably from about 1.0 to 100 parts per willion of water contained in the aqueous system to be treated.The polymers nlay be added directly into the desired water system in a fixed quantity and in the state of an aqueous solution, continuously or intermittently. The polymers of the present invention are not limited to use in any specific category of water system.

Deposit Control Activity One method of evaluating deposit control activity of a material consists of measuring its ability to prevent bulk phase precipitation of a salt at conditions for which the salt would normally precipitate. It is additionally important to recognize that the material being evaluated is tested at substoichio metric concentrations. That is, typical molar ratios of precipitating cation to the material being evaluated are on the order of 20 1 and much greater. Consequently, stoichiometric sequestration is not the route through which bulk phase precipitation is prevented. This well known phenomenon is also called threshold treatment and is widely practiced in water treatment technology for the prevention of scale salt deposits from forming on various surfaces.In the results that follow calcium phosphate and calcium phosphonate salts have been selected as precipitants. Inhibition of calcium phosphate is important in those treatment approaches wherein orthophosphates are used in the system to promote formation of the passivated gamma iron oxide film along the treated metal surfaces. Presently, in highly alkaline systems, phosphonic acid derivatives are commonly used to inhibit calcium carbonate formation. In these systems the precipitation of calcium phosphonate has proven to be a problem. The polymers of the present invention has been evaluated for their ability to prevent precipitation i.e., inhibit crystÅallization of these salts. The results are expressed as percent inhibition , positive values indicate that the stated percentage of precipitate was prevented from being formed.Except as where noted to the contraaz, the following conditions, solutions, and testing procedure were utilized to perform the inhibition tests, the results of which are reported herein in Tables II to IVa.

These conditions closely simulate the environment in a field cooling system. In this test system treated water is circulated by a centrifugal pump through a corrosion coupon by pass into which corrosion coupons are inserted, and past a mild steel AISI 1010 heat exchanger tube contained in a plexiglass block. The inside of the exchanger tube is filled with silicone oil and heated with an electric heater. The temperature of the silicone oil can be regulated. The water velocity past the corrosion coupons and heat exchanger tube can be controlled anywhere from 0 to 4.5 ft sec. The pH and temperature of the bulk water are automatically controlled. The treated water is prepared by chemical addition to deionized water. Provisions for continuous make up and blowdown are made by pumping fresh treated water from supply tanks to the sump, with overflow from the sump serving as blowdown. Corrosion rates are determined by exposing precleaned and weighed metal specimens for a specified period of time, after which they are removed, cleaned and reweighed. Corrosion rates are calculated by dividing the total coupon weight loss by the number of days of exposure.

The tests were each conducted with two non pretreated low carbon steel coupons which were immersed and rotated in aerated synthetic cooling water for a 3 or 4 day period.The water was adjusted to the desired pH and readjusted after one day if necessary no further adjustments were made.Water temperature was 120 F, and rotational speed was maintained to give a water velocity of 1.3 feet per second past the coupons. Cooling water was manufactured to give the conditions indicated in Table XII. Corrosion rates were determined by weight loss measurement. Prior to immersion, coupons were scrubbed with a mixture of trisodium phosphate pumice, rinsed with water, rinsed with isopropanol and then air dried. Weight measurement to the nearest milligram was made. At the end of one day, a weighed coupon was removed and cleaned. Cleaning consisted of immersion into a 50 solution of C1 for about 20 seconds, rinsing with tap water, scrubbing with a mixture of trisodium phosphate pumice until clean and. then rinsing with tap water and isopropanol. When dry, a second weight measurement to the nearest milligram was made. At the termination of the tests, the remaining coupon was removed, cleaned and weighed. Corrosion rates were calculated by differential weight loss according to the equation Corrosion Rate t4th Day Weight Loss 1st Day Weight Loss As shown in Table XVI, these polymers all gave substantial corrosion protection when used in combination with molybdate MoO4 .

As the polymers are effective in inhibiting calcium phosphate formation, they would also be effective in gas scrubbing systems where scrubbing mediums such as sewage treatment effluents contain high phosphate levels. Such systems would have the prerequisite for the Tornation and deposition of calcium phosphate which is to be avoided. Additional areas of application such as the phosphate production and processing field, fertilizer field, automotive metallic part pretreatment field, etc. will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Further, the copolymers are effective in dispersing iron oxide Table V which is sometimes encountered as a troublesome fouling species. Additionally, the terpolymers are effective in dispersing montmorillonite clay Table XII another commonly encountered fouling species. In another aspect of the present invention, the water soluble copolymers and terpolymers herein specified, when used conjointly with orthophosphate, passivate metal surfaces in contact with the water system. Under this treatment approach, corrosion is inhibited without productiuon of substantial attendant scale deposition along the treated metal surface as would be expected in barrier film approaches In order to passivate the metal surfaces, the aqueous system should first be adjusted to a pH of 5.5 or above, and secondly measured to assure a calcium ion content or other appropriate ion such as zinc, nickel, chromium and mixtures thereof . The water soluble copolymers or terpolymers should then be conjointly used with a water soluble orthophosphate compound.Exemplary orthophosphate compounds include phosphoric acid, the sodium orthophosphates, the potassium orthophosphates, the lithium orthophosphates and ammonium orthophosphates. The following specific compounds are exemplary H3P04 phosphoric acid LiH2PO4 lithium di acid phosphate Na3PO4 trisodium orthophosphate Na2HP04 di sodium orthophosphate NaH2PO4 monosodium orthophosphate NaH3 P04 2 hemisodium orthophosphate K3P04 tripotassium orthophosphate K2HPO4 di potassium orthophosphate KH2P04 monopotassium orthophosphate NH4 3P04 triammonium orthophosphate NH4 2HP04 diammonium orthophosphate NH4 H2P04 monoammonium orthophosphate In addition to the inorganic orthophosphates set forth above may be mentioned the organic orthophosphates which are set forth in U.S. Pat No. 3,510,436. The sp ecific compounds are those which possess the basic formula EMI41.1 where R is an organic radical as described in the patent, X is A or R, and A is.H, Na, Li, K or NH4. Compounds of the above nature are an excellent source of orthophosphate. In accordance with the passivation aspect of the invention, it is essential to use the polymers with an appropriate ort hophosphate source. For enhanced protection, the polymer and orthophosphate may be combined with an organo phosphonate, such as hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid and or a polyphosphate. Accordingly, the invention contemplates the use of a composition containing the copolymers and terpolymers and the orthophosphate and optionally but preferably the phosphonate, the polyphosphate and copper corrosion inhibitors. A typical composition contains on a weight ratio basis of polymer to orthophosphate expressed as P043 of about 1 8 to about 4 1 4 and preferably about 1 6 to 2 7. When a polyphosphate is included, the weight ratio of orthophosphate to polyphosphate on a PO4 3 to PO4 3 basis is 15 1 to 1 3, and preferably 2.5 1 to 1 1. Similarly, if the organo phosphate is included, the ratio of the orthophosphate to the phosphonate expressed asP04 3 to P04 3 is 1 2 to 13 1, and preferably 2 1 to 8 1.Any copper corrosion inhibitor may be included in the composition 0.01 to 5 by weight in an amount which will be effective for controlling the copper corrosion in a given system 0.05 to 10 parts per million and preferably 0.5 to 5 parts per million. In treating the aqueous systems the following dosages are desirable, with the dosages, of course, being based upon the severity of the corrosion problem foreseen or, experienced orthophosphate expressed as PO4 3 2 to 50 parts per million parts of water ppm and preferably 6 to 30 ppm polymer o 3 to 120 ppm and preferably 3 to 25 ppm of water polyphosphate expressed Åas P043 0.1 to 30, and preferably 3 to 10, parts per million parts of water phosphonate expressed as PO4 3 0.04 to 20, and preferably 1 to 6 parts per million parts of water. The preferred rate of application of this treatment to cooling water systems and the ratios of various components depends on the calcium concentration of the cooling water. The treatment is preferably applied in waters having between 15 ppm and 1,000 ppm calcium. Within this range the weight ratio of calcium to orthophosphate is varied from 1 1 to 83.3 1, the weight ratio of the copolymers or terpolymers to orthophosphate is varied from 1 3 to 1.5 1. As earlier disclosed, the orthophosphate is generally obtained by direct addition. However, it is understood that the orthophosphate can also arise due to reversion of either inorganic polyphosphates or the organo phosphonates, or any other appropriate source or precursor thereof. The above dosages represent the most ÅaesFra alleges since most systems will be treatable therewith. Higher dosages are permissible when the situation demands, but of course are most costly. The effectiveness of the inventive treatments is dependent upon the aqueous medium having a pH of 5.5 and above, and preferably 6.5 to 9.5, and containing calcium ion concentrations of, preferably about 15 parts per million parts of water.Below this range, it may be necessary for overall effectiveness to add metallic ions such as zinc, nickel, chromium, etc., as described in column 3, lines 4 to 24 of U.S. Pat. No. 3,837,803.
