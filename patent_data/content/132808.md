# Cyclic dwell engine.

## Abstract
The invention disclosed herein is a cyclic power mechan ism including means providing for a variable dwell between cycles of the mechanism produces energy during each cycle and stores the energy of each cycle for consumption. The variable dwell between cycles is terminated and a new cycle is initiated upon the consumption of a preestablished portion of the stored energy. A preferred embodiment of the mechanism is a free piston engine operation on an Otto cycle. The piston of the engine is restrained after each combustion cycle as the energy of that combustion is stored for use. When a preestab lished portion of the stored energy has been consumed, the piston is released and forced into another compression and combustion cycle for further storage of the combustion energy.
