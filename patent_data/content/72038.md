## Abstract
A fuel cell includes a cell unit 10 divided by an anode 2 and a cathode 1 into a fuel chamber 15 , an electrolyte chamber 13 , and an air chamber 14 . As the fuel, a mixture of an alcohol and water is used, which has been mixed at a predetermined ratio and stored in a fuel tank 16 from which is is supplied to the anode chamber 15 through a conduit 18 which may contain a valve 17 controlled in accordance with the anode current. Moisture from the air chamber 14 may be extracted by means of a trap 4 and stored in a water tank 19 from which it is taken out and mixed with the alcohol stored in an alcohol tank 20 .
