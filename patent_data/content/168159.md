# Lamp.

## Abstract
A lamp for use with a recline chair, or like item of furniture includes a pedestal 10 , a horizontally extending light fixture 11 and a three link parallelogram linkage 12 supporting said fixture from said pedestal. The pedestal and fixture include parallel surfaces extending approximately 45 to the horizontal in which the links are mounted with ball and socket joints 63, 64 . Two of the links extend beyond the ball joints and are interconnected by short transverse links. In the pedestal the connecting transverse link 70 is connected to one or two tension coil springs 74, 75 balancing the light fixture in any position. The pedestal may support a cantilever table 26 to serve as a side table for the furniture used with the lamp. The fixture may include a semi cylindrical reflector with pivotal shades 111 at each edge. The fixture is thus mounted and maintained in its horizontal position for adjustment throughout a spherical segment with the linkage moving within a right spherical cone, or from a horizontal to a vertical position, the axis of such cone thus extending at an angle of approximately 135 to the vertical axis of the pedestal.
