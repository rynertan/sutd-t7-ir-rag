In particular this invention relates to intermediates and methods for producing intermediates for the production of 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine and its esters and ethers. 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethvl guanine hereinafter DHPG and its esters are potent antiviral agents and have been prepared by methods disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 4,355,032 and European PatentApplications 49,072 72,027 and 74,306. Similar compounds having similar side chains are disclosed inU.S. Patents 4,347,360 and 4,199,574. The present invention relates to new intermediates and to an improved process whereby the new DHPG ether or ester side chain intermediate is prepared in fewer steps than other currently used processes and produces fewer undesirable by products. The side chain intermediates for the preparation ofDHPG and its ethers and esters have been produced in the past by reacting epichlorohydrin with a benzyl alcohol, to obtain a symmetrically substituted l,3 dibenzyl glycerol, which is then chloromethyated. The chloromethyl compound is converted to the acetate or formate ester, which is then reacted with guanine to add to the 9 position of guanine. See U.S. Patent 4,355,032. An alternate synthesis is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,347,360 where 1,3 dichloro 2 propanol is reacted with sodium benzylate forming the chloromethoxy derivative which is reacted further with a purine base. A third method is disclosed in European PatentApplication 74,306 published March 3, 1983. In this application the side chain is made by starting with glycerol formal, a mixture of 1,3 dioxan 5 ol and l,3 dioxolane 4 methanol. The glycerol formal is acylated and the mixture is separated. The acylated compound is then reacted with acetic anhydride in the presence of ZnC12 to give a compound that can be reacted with a purine. These syntheses are all multistep methods that involve complicated separation and purification techniques and do not involve the intermediates of this invention. It would be advantageous to have a process that was straight forward required fewer steps , used easily obtainable starting materials, did not create unwanted isomers, and allowed facile substitution of the terminal esters. The claimed invention provides all these features. In particular, DHPG and a wide variety of 1,3 di esters and 1,3 di ethers of DHPG can easily he made using the intermediates and process of this invention. This invention provides a process for preparing a compound represented by the FormulaEMI3.1 Formula A wherein R1 and R3 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, optionally substituted lower alkyl, acyl, l adamantanoyl, optionally substituted phenyl or optionally substituted phenyl lower alkyl and R4 is optionally substituted lower alkyl, comprising reacting a compound represented by the FormulaEMI3.2 Formula B wherein each R4 is independently selected from the group as defined above, with a compound represented by the FormulaEMI3.3 Formula C wherein R1 and R3 are as previously defined, and R6 is defined as optionally substituted lower alkyl, in the presence of a catalyic amount of a Lewis acid for time sufficient to form a compound represented by Formula A.

As used in the specification and appended claims, unless specified to the contrary, the following terms have the meaning indicated. Lower alkyl is defined as any straight or branched chain hydrocarbon group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, i propyl, butyl, t butyl, and the like. Optionally substituted1, refers to a substitution on an alkyl or phenyl group with halogen atoms, lower alkyl groups, and phenyl groups. Optionally substituted guanine refers to a guanine molecule which is optionally substituted with acyl and or alkyl 3Si groups on the amino group at position 2 and on the nitrogen at position 9. Acyl is defined herein as optionally substituted alkyl C O having four to twenty carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, optionally substituted phenyl C 0 , or optionally substituted alkyl phenyl C O where the optional substitution is on the phenyl ring. Examples include n hexanoyl, n heptanoyl, palmitoyl, steracanoyl, arachidoyl, pivaloyl, l methyl l cyclohexane carboxoyl, 2 octyl decanoyl, benzoyl, p chlorobenzoyl, toluoyl, phenylacetyl, 3 phenylpropanoyl, and 4 phenylbutanoyl. Pivalic acid is 2,2 dimethyl propionic acid. l adamantanoyl refers the radical having the structure identified below.EMI7.1 l adamantanoyl Phenyl refers to a six member carbon ring which contains 3 double bonds. Alkyl phenyl refers to a phenyl group which has an alkyl chain substituted on it wherein alkyl is as defined above. Hydrogen donor refers to any substance that can serve as a source of active hydrogen. Some examples of hydrogen donors are hydrogen gas, cyclohexene, 1,4 cyclohexadiene and the like. In some cases catalysts may be used in conjunction with hydrogen donors, for example, the noble metals, for example, platinum, palladium, and rhodium may be used as a finely divided metal or as metal supported on any conventional catalyst support, for example, carbon, alumina, or silica. Acid when used in this specification will normally be modified by either a soecific named acid, for example, pivalic acid, or would be modified as a protic acid or aLewis acid. Lewis acid refers to any acid that does not have an abstractable proton. Examples include Be CH3 2, 3 BF3, B O alkyl 3, A1 CH3 , A1 C1 3, Fe Mg , Ca , Cu , TiC14, Hg , Co 2 2 Fe , Zn and the like. A comprehensive list of Lewis acids can be found at Chem. Rev., 75, 1, 1975 , on page 2. Protic acid refers to any Bronsted acid having a pKa less than 2.0, and preferably less than 1.0 that has an abstractable proton. Examples include mineral acids, for example, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrogen halides, for example, hydrochloric acid organic acids, for example, trifloroacetic acid, organic sulfonic acids, for example phenyl sulfonic acid, and particularly preferred, para toluene sulfonic acid and acidic resins, for example Amberlysts Rohm and Haas . Protecting qroups refer to any group which can protect the functionality of a compound and may be removed by hydrolysis or hydrogenation. Examples of protecting groups useful in the present invention are sterically hindered groups where sterically hindered refers to a particular atomic grouping which hinders or inhibits an expected chemical reaction due to its bulk , benzyl or optionally substituted benzyl, or alkyl groups, and sterically hindered silyl groups of the general formula RDSi R2 . Alkoxy methyl ether means a compound represented by the formula A O CH2 O B where A and B are optionally substituted lower alkyl groups. One process of the present invention as depicted inReaction Scheme I. REACTION SCHEME IEMI9.1 Formula F Formula G AEMI9.2 wherein R1 and R3 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, optionally subtituted lower alkyl, l adamantanoyl, acyl, optionally subtituted phenvl or optionally subtituted phenyl lower alkyl, and R is 4C O OCH or R6OCH wherein R4 R C O OCH2 or R60CH2 wherein R4 and R6 are independently selected from optionally subtituted lower alkyl. In Reaction Sequence A a dialkyloxy methane FormulaF is reacted with an anhydride Formula G in the presence of a protic acid catalyst. The two reactants are present in about a one to one molar ratio in the presence of a catalytic amount of a protic acid, for example, organic sulfonic acids, for example, para toluene sulfonic acid, or catalytic amounts of a mineral acid, for example, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. The reaction can be done in an aprotic hydrocarbon solvent, for example benzene, or neat, typically at reflux temperature of the solution. The solution is reacted for 1 to 12 hours, 6 hours being about tynical. See the method of J. Am. Cem.Soc., 76, page 5161 1954 . It is preferred that the anhydride and dialkyloxy methane be symmetric becausethe number of possible products is dramatically reduced by using symmetical reagents. Asymmetrical anhydrides or asymmetrical alkyloxy methanes can, of course, be reacted together in the process of this invention. In certain cases asymmetrical anhydrides can be selective for one of the possible products. The l,3 dialkanovl glycerol Formula E can be prepared in one of two ways. Treatment of glycerol with slightly more than two equivalents of an acid chloride or an acid anhydride in aprotic solvents in the presence of organic base, for example, trialkylamines, and a nucleophilic catalyst, for example, pyridine can afford the 1,3 dialkanoyl glycerol Formula E. Alternatively these compounds are accessible from dihydroxyacetone using the method of 3. Org. Chem., 35, 2082, 1970 . Treatment of dihydroxvacetone in pyridine with an equivalent of the appropriate fatty acid chloride followed by reduction of the central keto group with borohydride in tetrahydrofuran can afford the 1,3 dialkanoyl glycerol Formula E. In Reaction Sequence B compound Formula D and compound Formula E are reacted together in the presence of a protic acid catalyst, for example, organic sulfonic acids, for example, para toluene sulfonic acid, or catalytic amounts of a mineral acid, for example, hydrochloric acid or sufuric acid, to produce a mixture Formula C . This mixture is composed of compound ofFormula A and.compound of Formula C . Compounds ofFormula D and Formula E are mixed together neat with a catalytic amount of a protic acid catalyst. It is preferable that an excess of the compound of Formula D be used, the excess being useful as a solvent for the reaction. The reactants can be mixed together without the necessity of an external heat source, although the application of heat will speed the reaction. Reaction B can be exothermic, and when the temperature drops to ambient temperature the reaction is over. The reaction takes between 1 and 6 hours, typically about 2 hours to complete. The mixture Formula C will vary depending on the starting materials. For example, if R1 and R3 are benzyl, reaction sequence B produces mostly Formula A, but if R1 and R3 are pivaloyl reaction sequence B produces mostly Formula C . Reaction sequence C may be deleted if the product of Reaction Sequence B is a compound of Formula A. Otherwise, the compounds are reacted according to Reaction Sequence C. In Reaction Sequence C, the mixture of compounds ofFormula C is then further reacted in presence of a alkyl anhydride and a Lewis acid catalyst. It is preferred that the anhydride used in this reaction be a symmetrical anhydride to reduce the possible number of products formed, although this is not a requirement for this reaction. The catalytic acid is preferably a non protic Lewis acid catalyst, for example, boron trifluoride, or aluminum trichloride. The reaction temperature climbs from ambient temperature to about 500C at which point temperature control is applied. The temperature of the reaction is generally kept between about 450 and 650C, preferably between about 500C and about 600C. The progress of the reaction is typically followed by thin layer chromatography TLC to indicate the amount of reaction that has occurred. After between 60 and 180 minutes the reaction will normally he complete. The reaction mixture is extracted with an organic solvent which is washed with sodium carbonate and water. The organic layer is then dried and the product Formula A obtained hy the evaporation of the solvent. Once compound Formula A is obtained esters or ethers of DHPG or DHPG itself can then be easily obtained, if desired. Reaction Schemes II and III show this process. REACTION SCHEME IIFormula AEMI12.1 Compound Formula A can be converted into a 2 haloalkyl 1,3 diacyl glycerol using HX where X is a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, in methylene chloride. Protected guanine Formula H produced for example by the methods of Tshido et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 37, 1389 1964 , is reacted with compound Formula A, as 5 isolated from Reaction Scheme I. R is acyl or hydrogen and, if acyl, together with the guanine s 5 nitrogen that R protects, forms, preferably, a monoamide of a lower alkanoic acid, for example, acetamide, or propionamide. The reaction is conducted at elevated temperature under vacuum, in the presence of an acidic catalyst, for example para toluene sulfonic acid.The DHPG derivative, Formula J, is then formed, whereR1 and R3 are as previously defined. If the derivative ester or ether is directly useful, for example dipivaloyl DHPG or di adamantanoyl DHPG, then no further reactions are necessary if R5 was hydrogen. If R5 was acyl, then the ester or ether of DHPG can be prepared by reacting compound of Formula J with, for example, methanolic ammonia. If DHPG is desired, Formula J can be deprotected removal of R1, R , and R5 , forming DHPG, by reacting the compound with the mixture of, for example, ammonium hydroxide and water. REACTION SCHEME IIIFormula A EMI14.1 Alternatively, Formula A can be reacted directly with a trialkylsilyl protected guanine to afford the 0HPP ester or ether. Guanine or an optionally substituted guanine derivative is heated in an aprotic hydrocarbon solvent, for example, toluene, or xylenes and the like, with greater than 3 molar equivalents of hexa lower alkyl silazane, for example, hexamethylsilazane, hexaethylsilazane and the like, and a catalyst. The catalyst is selected from the group of trialkyl silyl sulfates, chlorosilanes, ammonium sulfate and pyridine. A volume of volatiles equal to the volume of hydrocarbon solvent is removed by vacuum distillation from the resulting solution.Then compound Formula A is added and the mixture is heated at a temperature greater than ambient temperature until anaylsis of the mixture byTLC shows the consumption of Formula A and the formation of the DHPG ester or ether Formula 3 . Treatment of the reaction mixture at this time to remove all the trimethylsilyl groups, for example, by heating with lower alkyl alcohols, for example, methanol, ethanol or iso propanol, affords the DHPG ester or ether which can be purified by standard methods. If R5 is acyl, thenR5 can be removed with, for example, methanolic ammonia to obtain the DHPG ester or ether. If DHPG is desired,Formula 3 can be deprotected R1, R3, and R5 by reaction with a mixture of, for examples, ammonium hydroxide and water. EXAMPLES The following nonlimiting examples show various aspects of this invention. EXAMPLE 1 l,3 di l adamantanoyl glycerol In a flask under nitrogen 1.053 gms of glycerol is dissolved in 4 ml of pyridine and 6 ml of methylene chloride and cooled to about lO0C. Then 5.00 gms of l adamantanoyl chloride Aldrich Chemical Co. is added in one portion and stirring is continued for about half an hour with cooling and then another two hours at ambient temperature. The resulting solid is filtered and washed with methylene chloride.
