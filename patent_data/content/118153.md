# Pager decoding system.

## Abstract
A pager decoding system which is suitable for use with signal formats, such as POCSAG, in which code words are sent in batches, each batch containing a synchronisation code word and n 1 address message code words, n being the number of code words in a batch, each code word comprising m bits. The pager is able to detect or regain synchronisation code word when the carrier signal is lost due to fading. When synchronisation is lost input data received by the pager is combed through by switching on the pager for a duration of m bits at intervals corresponding to n 1 code words. The data received is stored in a shift register 108 having m stages and in which a synchronisation code word can be assembled within two batch periods. Once the synchronisation code word has been detected the pager 100 can be switched to a normal data receive mode. In another fade recovery mode the m 1 th, mth, and m 1 th bit positions every nth code word are searched to see if a preamble or synchronisation code word is present. If none is detected after a predetermined number of batches has been searched then the pager assumes the loss of synchronisation mode described above.
