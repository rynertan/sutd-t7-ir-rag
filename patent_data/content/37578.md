# Discrete type automated chemical analytic apparatus.

## Abstract
A discrete type automated chemical analytic apparatus wherein two reagent nozzles 32,61 and specimen nozzle 71 supported by the corresponding carrier members 31, 53, 66 in a vertically movable state are so arranged that said nozzles can be intermittently carried lengthwise of the reaction line 13 formed on the endless conveyor belt 10 and also cross wise of said reaction line 13 and a sample cassette 75 holding a large number of specimens is made movable lengthwise of the conveyor belt independently of the speci men nozzle 71 .
