# Ultraviolet curable outer coatings for optical fiber.

## Abstract
Buffer coated and topcoated optical glass fiber is dis closed in which the topcoat has the high strength and high tensile modulus combined with good elongation and water resistance associated with extruded jacket coatings, but which is applied by ordinary coating procedures and cured by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The coating composi tions which enable this to be achieved comprise 30 to about 80 of linear diacrylate functional polyurethanes which are the linear polyurethane reaction product of polycarbonate diol with organic diisocyanate in molar prop ortions providing an average of at least about 2 urethane linkages per molecule, these linear polyurethanes being end capped with acrylate groups, and these polyurethanes being used in combination with at least 15 of liquid monoethylenically unsaturated monomer having a glass transition temperature above about 55 C.
