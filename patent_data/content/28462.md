APPARATUS FOR LIFTING OR LOWERING A LOAD It is known that at least one load can be lifted or lowered by means of a longitudinally extensible boom having first and second end portions, sid first end portion being adapted to support at least one said load, said second end portion being adapted to be pivotally mounted about an axis of rotation constituted by a spindle so that said bocn can pivot upwards or downwards.In one example of such a boom, said pivotal mounting can be provided on a fork lift truck. A problem present with the vertical stability of a said fork lift truck is that the position of the centre of gravity of the loaded boon will change with change in length of said bocn. Thus, depending on the position of the centre of gravity of the boon, and the lod applied to the first end portion of the toon, there nay be risk of the fork lift truck overturning during change in the length of the boom while said load is applied. It has now been found in accordance with the present invention that said problem can be overcome or mitigated by utilising at least one signal in response to position of said centre cf gravity. This utilisation can find many applications, fo example hen the fork lift truck is another vehicle, as will be described later herein.

One preferred embodiment of the present invention will not be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a schematic view of one fork lift truck embodying the present inventIon andFig. 2 is G vie of a spindle fitted with two strain gauges, the spindle constituting an axis of rotation for one of two identical hydraulic pistons for displacing a longitudinally extensible boom fitted to the fork lift truck of Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, a longitudinally extensible telescopic arm 1 constitutes an extensible boom for lifting or lowering at least one load. At a first end portion of the arm 1 is mounted a removable work platform 2. At the other end portion of the arm 1, the arm 1 is pivotally mounted about an axis of rotation constituted by a spindle 3 of trunnion means mounted on an elevatable support platform 4 carried by the forks 5 of the fork lift truck 6. There are two forks 5 side by side and inserted into respective pockets in the support platform 4. At each side of the arm 1 is a respective hydraulic cylinder 7.The first end portion of each cylinder 7 comprises a respective piston 8 pivotally connected to a respective upper portion 9 of the arm 1, at location between the spindle 3 and a variably positionable centre of gravity 10 of arm 1. The other end portions of each cylinder 7 are pivotally mounted each about a respective axis of rotation constituted by a spindle 11, there being respective spindles 11 for each cylinder 7. The spindles 1 are parts of respective trunnion means mounted on the elevatable support platform 4. The locations of the spindles 11 are between the variable centre of gravity 10 and the spindle 3. Each spindle 11 Fig. 2 has inserted therein tw respective strain gauges 12 symmetrically located so as to correspond to opposite sides of the cylinder 7 comprising that spindle 11. The strain gauges 12 till provide output signals to a control weans 13 taunted on the elevatable support plstforn 4 or elsewhere on the fork lift truck, one instance of such alternative mounting being showy by the reference numeral 14 in Fig. 1. he control means 13 comprises a heatstone bridge responsive to the output signals from the strain gauges 12, those signals passing to the control means 13 via a line 15 Fig. 2 . When the output signals change in response to change in location of the centre of gravity 10 of the arm 1, the control means 13 will respond in at least one predetermined manner, for example trigger predetermined safety operations.For instance, the control moans 13 can activate a yellow light when the safe working load of the boom and or fork lift truck is approached, and when such a safe working load is reached activate a red light. As soon as an unsafe working load for the boon and or the fork lift truck is reached, the control means 13 can isolate in a predetermined safe miner at least one function of the boon and or of the fork lift truck. It will be appreciated that the elevatable support platform 4 can be regarded as part of the boom. The arm 1 can be articulatable or non articulatable.
