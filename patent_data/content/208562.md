# FIBER OPTIC SENSOR

## Abstract
Disclosed is an improved fiber optic sensor of the type in which a fiber optic waveguide component of the sensor is configured to be responsive to an external parameter such that curvature of the fiber optic waveguide is altered in response to forces induced by changes in the external para meter being sensed. The alteration of the curvature of the fiber optic waveguide causes variations in the intensity of light passing therethrough, these variations being indicative of the state of the external parameter. The improvement comprises coating material covering the exterior portion of the fiber optic waveguide, the coating material having an expansion coefficient and thickness such that distortion of the fiber optic waveguide caused by thermally induced stresses between the coating material and the glass fiber is substanti ally eliminated. Also disclosed is a support member for supporting the curved fiber optic waveguide, the support member and fiber optic waveguide being configured and arranged to minimize the effects of thermal stresses tending to separate the waveguide from the support member.
