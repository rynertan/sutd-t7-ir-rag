# Dispensing spigot.

## Abstract
A dispensing spigot for a container in which the spigot 15 is mounted on a spout 10 and a portion 18 of the deformable diaphragm wall 19 sealingly engages the internal surface of the spout wall 12. To improve sealing a groove 21 is provided in the diaphragm wall and a flange 14 projects from the spout wall 12 into the groove 21 to sealingly engage the surface 23 of groove 21. This arrangement of the flange 14 and groove 21 restricts leakage between the spout 12 and the deformable wall 18.
