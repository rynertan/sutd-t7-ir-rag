# Bi directional liquid sample handling system.

## Abstract
An automatic liquid transfer system includes a horizon tally translatable table 10 and a pipette 36 that is translat able both vertically and horizontally in a direction transverse to the axis of translation of the table 10 . The table 10 accom modates one or more titer trays 78 having a multiplicity of re ceptacles to be filled, or holding liquid samples to be diluted, transferred, or aspirated, and a rack housing plural rows of dis posable tips 84 . Between each cycle in a liquid transfer pro cess, a fresh tip 84 is picked up by the pipette 36 and used to transfer liquid in a sterile manner from a sample or diluent source to a well in the titer tray 78 , or from one well to a differ ent well anywhere on the one tray or to a receptacle in a differ ent tray, where it is mixed with diluent. Thereafter, the tip 84 is discharged back into the rack to maintain sterile conditions during the process and a new tip 84 is installed.
