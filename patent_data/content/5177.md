The tube bundle 23 is lifted into the cask 37 after such bundle 23 has been separated from the generator s tubesheet, the cask 37 which consists of multiple longitudinal sections 39 interconnected by removable means is then lifted from the shell 3 to a nearby site, a lower portion of said tube bundle 23 is cut off for disposition within the lowermost longitudinal section of said cask 37 , the remaining tube bundle containing cask sections 39 are lifted free of the lowermost cask section which is closed by a respective new bottom cover. The cutoff and lifting steps are repeated until the entire tube bundle is disposed in respective longitudinal sections of said cask, which are removed from the reactor containment with the cut tube bundle portions enclosed therein.
