# High impact resistant polyester compositions, and articles made therefrom.

## Abstract
High impact resistant compositions comprise a 25 95 by weight of aromatic polyester b 1 to 50 by weight of aromatic polycarbonate c the balance to make 100 of core shell polymer comprising a first elastomeric phase comprising 75 to 99.8 by weight of C₁ C₆ alkyl acrylate units, 0.1 to 5 cross linking monomer units, 0.1 to 5 graft linking monomer units, and final rigid thermoplastic phase, the weight ratio of first to final stages being 25 to 95 75 to 5 based on a total of 100 parts. The polyester usually used is poly ethylenetereph thalate and the compositions are very suitable for making injection moulded articles and or glass fibre reinforced arti cles.
