## Description
The present invention relates to a process for producing a concentrate of the anti hemophilic Factor VIII, also called AHF. It is known that the ability of the blood to coagulate is controlled by a system of coagulation proteins, of which AHF or Factor VIII is an important component. Hemophilia A patients have completely or partly lost the ability to produce AHF. AHF containing preparations are injected to treat this diseasse, and it is therefore important to have preparations containing suitably high concentrations of AHF and with as low a content of other proteins as possible, such as fibrinogen and immunoglobulins. In particular in the treatment of inhibitor patients i.e. patients who produce antibodies against AHF and who therefore need administration of the preparation in excess with high doses of AHF, it is important that the specific activity units AHF mg protein is high since supply of other proteins in large amounts may cause undesirable side effects. Side effects in AHF treatment caused by immunoglobulins is described e.g. by Tilsner et al., Münch. Med. Wschr. 124 1982 No. 22, p. 553 557. AHF is normally recovered from the so called cryoprecipitate, which mainly consists of fibrinogen, albumin, IgG and IgM, while AHF constitutes less than 1 of the total protein amount. The specific activity of a cryoprecipitate is typically 0.1 to 0.3 unit AHF mg protein. It is known that part of the unnecessary protein can be removed by precipitation with glycine or polyethylene glycol PEG . Precipitation can optionally be accomplished several times, first with one precipitant and then with the other. Thus, it has been known for a long time to precipitate AHF with about 2M glycine at a low temperature, cf. Webster et al., Amer. J. Med. Sc. 250, No. 6, p. 643 650 1965 . Webster used a cryoprecipitate which was dissolved in water and fractionated at a low temperature 10 C with increasing concentrations of glycine until 2.3 molar. This type of precipitation relies upon the fact that AHF is precipitated in the cold together with fibrinogen by addition of glycine. This results in a specific activity of 0.3 to 0.5 unit AHF mg protein. It is known from the EP Patent Specification No. 32,655, that when redissolved cryoprecipitate is fractionated with 2M glycine as a precipitant at higher temperatures such as 30 to 45 C, a large proportion of the other proteins, such as fibrinogen, is precipitated first so that AHF remains in the supernatant, from which it can be recovered. When PEG is used as a precipitant, fractionated PEG precipitation is frequently accomplished where most of the fibrinogen and some IgM are removed by precipitation with a low PEG concentration 2 to 6 , and then AHF is precipitated from the albumin containing supernatant with a high PEG concentration 5 to 15 . Such PEG PEG precipitations are described by e.g. Newman et al., Brit. J. Haematology According to the US Patent Specification No. 4,027,013 Bick et al an admixture containing clottable fibrinogen and Factor VIII, presumably redissolved cryoprecipitate, is freed of 90 of the fibrinogen content by precipitation with a block copolymer of the Pluronic type, it being also possible to use PEG in a less preferred embodiment which leads to significantly lower yields. The supernatant from the first fibrinogen precipitation is then treated with higher concentrations of Pluronic to precipitate Factor VIII and residual fibrinogen. The Factor VIII containing precipitate is redissolved in more concentrated form and is then treated with a thrombin mimetic enzyme, which is stated to specifically clot the total amount of residual fibrinogen, but not significantly impair the biological activity of Factor VIII. However, the latter is not documented more fully, and in order to stabilize Factor VIII in the following lyophilization Bick adds albumin. This might indicate that after all the enzyme has impaired Factor VIII so that it has become unstable. In any event, Bick s product is not commercially available. Processes comprising multi step precipitations where more than one precipitant is used are likewise known. Glycine precipitation at a low temperature, e.g., can be carried out both before and after PEG PEG precipitations, and glycine precipitations can optionally be carried out both before and after the PEG PEG precipitations. This is described in the US Patent Specification 3,682,881 and the US Patent Specification No. 3,631,018. Generally, this results in preparations with a specific activity of 1 to 3 units mg protein. Brinkhous et al, JAMA, vol. 205, No. 9 26 Aug. 1968 p. 613 617 discloses AHF concentrates obtained by PEG glycine precipitation. Brinkhous obtained specific activities in the range of 1.6 to 5.5 units mg. The olubility was only 105 units ml. When in this context precipitation with glycine is accomplished at a low temperature, the AHF containing precipitate is utilized, i.e. in subsequent PEG precipitations on a redissolved AHF containing precipitate there is only a low concentration of glycine in the solution. If glycine is used at a high temperature in connection with PEG precipitation, glycine precipitation is irst accomplished leaving AHF in the supernatant where the concentration of glycine is high, and AHF is hen precipitated from the supernatant by PEG precipitation at a high PEG concentration. This can give a pecific activity of 1 to 3 units mg protein. The concentrate obtained by this glycine PEG precipitation type resembles a concentrate obtained by PEG PEG precipitation. As appears from table 1, the 1st precipitation supernatent contains more IgM and IgG after a warm precipitation with 2M glycine than after a precipitation with a low PEG concentration 4 . After the final precipitation with a high PEG concentration 9 the concentrate from the glycine PEG precipitation contains less IgM and IgG than the concentrate from the PEG PEG precipitation. The reason of this is not known, but it must be assumed that the polar amino acid in the glycine supernatant has a salting in effect, in particular on basic proteins, so that IgM and IgG do not readily precipitate with PEG alone. The concentrate obtained by the glycine PEG precipitation, however, still has an undesirably high content of fibrinogen, IgG and IgM, cf. table 2 below. The object of the present invention is to provide a high purity AHF preparation having a high solubility and specific activity. Accordingly, the invention provides a process for producing a concentrate of the antihemophilic Factor VIII AHF substantially free of denatured AHF and other plasma proteins, but not of factor VIII RP, and having a solubility in an aqueous injection medium of 200 to 500 units AHF ml and a specific activity of 3.85 to 50 units AHF mg protein originating from the starting material for the production of the concentrate, wherein a cryoprecipitate or another AHF containing fraction from blood plasma after dissolution is subjected to adsorption on aluminum oxide to remove prothrombin and to fractionated precipitation with polyethylene glycol, PEG, in at least two steps, characterized by precipitating an aqueous solution of the cryoprecipitate in a first step with such an amount of PEG as will precipitate the main part, preferably at least 80 of the fibrinogen, subjecting the solution free of precipitated fibrinogen in a second step to another precipitation with PEG in the presence of a salting in agent, and then recovering the precipitate with a concentrated content of AHF. The US Patent Specification No. 4,361,509 Zimmerman et al describes a method of isolating Factor VIII C freed of Factor VIII RP von Willebrand factor by immunoabsorption on an agarose gel to which there are coupled monoclonal antibodies having a high affinity for Factor VIII RP, but which do, however, bind both Vlll C and VIII RP. Factor VIII C is later desorbed by elution with a calcium containing buffer. A highly purified Factor VIII C is obtained, having a very high specific activity 2300 U mg and presumably a good solubility in aqueous injection media. The invention is based on the surprising finding that a particularly pure AHF preparation, essentially freed of other proteins, in particular immunoglobulins, can be obtained by fractionating a cryoprecipitate with PEG in such a manner that a substantial amount, preferably at least 80 , of the fibrinogen is first precipitated, and then accomplishing precipitation in a subsequent step with more PEG in the presence of a salting in agent. The addition of the salting in agent per se does not cause any precipitations, but the presence of the salting in agent modifies the conditions under the subsequent PEG precipitation so that a sharper fractionation, i.e. a purer AHF preparation with a high specific activity, is obtained, cf. the following table 2. The high purity permits the preparation to be redissolved in a very small volume of aqueous injection medium in a concentration of 200 to 500 units of Factor VIII C AHF per ml. As a normal injection dose is 1000 units, an injection preparation of about 2 to 5 ml will thus suffice. As the solubility of the best commercially available AHF preparations is stated to be 40 to 50 units per ml corresponding to an injection volume of 25 to 20 ml, the preparation of the invention thus involves a very significant relief for the patient. Thus, in the precipitation according to the invention, glycine is used as a salting in agent as it stabilizes the undesired proteins by keeping them in solution, whereas the previously known methods rely on the salting Without being tied down to any specific theory, it is assumed that the effect of the salting in agent is due to its increasing the difference in surface charge between Factor VIII and the other proteins, in particular IgG. It is important to remove most of the fibrinogen in the first step because, otherwise, the AHF preparation would be highly contaminated with fibrinogen, and because the presence of fibrinogen in the second step would counteract the salting in effect and prevent selective precipitation of Factor VIII. The salting in agent may appropriately be an amino acid, in particular basic amino acids such as lysine, arginine and histidine, as well as polar amino acids such as serine, glutamine, glycine and ε aminohexanoic acid. Examples of other suitable salting in agents are carbohydrates such as mono , di and oligosaccharides, e.g. glucose, saccharose, as well as sugar alcohols, e.g. sorbitol and glycerol. A survey is given in table 3. In a few cases specific activities below 3.85 units mg were obtained. These examples serve as comparison. The preferred salting in agent is lysine. The drawing shows the influence of lysine on PEG PEG precipitation of AHF, expressed as units AHF mg protein Fig. 1 and yield, respectively, in relation to the cryoprecipitate at different lysine concentrations Fig. 2 . Lysine is preferably added in concentrations of 0.1 to 0.9, in particular 0.4 to 0.8, most preferably 0.5 to 0.7 mol l. As appears from Fig. 1, there is proportionality between added amount of lysine and specific activity of the end product, but even small lysine amounts have a distinct effect. As appears from Fig. 2, the yield of AHF, however, declines at the PEG concentration used if more than 0.75M lysine is employed, as this amount of lysine has also a salting in effect on AHF. Another preferred salting in agent is arginine, whose influence on the PEG PEG precipitation of AHF appears from table 4 below, from which it will be seen that satisfactory yields are obtained at concentrations of 0.2 to 0.8. In view of the yield the preferred amount is 0.3 to 0.5, in particular 0.4 mol l. The employed concentrations of PEG and salting in agent as well as pH during precipitation depend in particular upon the salting in agent used as it can be said generally that salting agents of greater charge can be used in smaller concentrations. The selected concentration of the salting in agent is based on a compromise since high concentrations can reduce the IgG amount almost completely, but some Factor VIII is salted in at the same time, which reduces the yield. PEG with a molecular weight of 200 to 20,000, preferably 2,000 to 12,000, in particular 3,000 to 6,000, can be used, but PEG 3,000 is preferred. The PEG concentration in the first precipitation step is usually 2 to 6 by weight, preferably 4 by weight, and is usually 6 to 20 by weight in the second step, preferably about 12 by weight. pH in the first precipitation step may be 6.0 to 8.5, preferably 6.2 to 6.6, in particular 6.4, and in the second step 5.0 to 8.5, preferably 6.0 to 6.6, in particular 6.3. The temperature in the first precipitation step may be 6 to 22 C, preferably 18 to 22 C. In the second precipitation step the temperature is also preferably 18 to 22 C room temperature . In the recovery of the present Factor VIII concentrate cryoprecipitate from human blood plasma or other Factor VIII containing blood fractions may be used, just as plasma fractions from other species of animals, e.g. pigs, may be used. In this case, a blood fraction obtained e.g. by PEG precipitation is normally used instead of the cryoprecipitate. The process of the invention will be explained more fully below by means of some examples, which also illustrate the processing of the concentrate. To produce the preparation, the AHF solution may if desired be subjected to a heat treatment for 10 hours at 60 C in the presence of a suitable stabilizer so as to provide a safeguard against hepatitis and or Iyophilized, if desired. Cryoprecipitate from 600 ml of human blood plasma is redissolved in 28 ml of citrate glucose buffer and is freed of prothrombin complex by adsorption with Al₂O₃. Then 4 by weight of PEG 3,000 is added. pH is adjusted to 6.4 with 0.5M HCI, and the mixture is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Precipitated protein is removed by centifugation, and lysine HCl is added until a concentration of 0.55 mole I. An additional 8 by weight of PEG 3,000 is added, and pH is adjusted to 6.3 with 0.1M NaOH. After incubation for 45 minutes at room temperature the precipitate is isolated by centrifugation and is redissolved in citrate glucose NaCl, pH 7.8. As seen from the following table 5, the redissolved precipitate, which contained 112 units of factor VIII C and 9 mg of total protein, has a specific activity of 12 units Factor VIII C AHF per mg protein, and the yield of Factor VIII C from plasma is 20 . These results appear from table 5 in which a comparison with results from a test without lysine addition can be made. The table shows that the specific activity can be significantly increased and the content of immunoglobulin G can be reduced in relation to a PEG PEG precipitation without the presence of a salting in agent. To 30 ml of cryo solution, adsorbed with Al₂O₃, is added 4 by weight of PEG 3,000. pH is adjusted to 6.4 with 0.5M HCl, and the mixture is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Precipitated protein is removed by centrifugation, and salting in agent is added. Then an additional 8 by weight of PEG 3,000 is added, and pH is adjusted to 6.3 with 0.1M NaOH. After incubation for 45 minutes at room temperature the precipitate is isolated by centrifugation and is redissolved in citrate glucose NaCI, pH 7.8. Table 6 gives the results obtained for the various salting in agents. Cryoprecipitate from 2.5 l of plasma is redissolved in 100 ml of citrate glucose buffer and freed of prothrombin complex by adsorption with Al₂O₃. 4 by weight of PEG 3.000 is added. pH is adjusted to 6.4 with 0.5M HCl, and the mixture is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Precipitated protein is removed by centrifugation, and arginine HCl is added until a concentration of 0.40 mol l. An additional 8 by weight of PEG 3,000 is added, and pH is adjusted to 6.3 with 0.1M NaOH. After incubation for 45 minutes at room temperature the precipitate is isolated by centrifugation and is redissolved in 20 ml of citrate saccharose NaCl, pH 7.8. The concentrate contains 360 units Factor VIII C and 52 mg protein specific activity 7 units mg . Cryoprecipitate from 2.5 l of plasma is redissolved in 100 ml of citrate glucose buffer and freed of prothrombin complex by adsorption with Al₂O₃. 4 by weight of PEG 3,000 is added. pH is adjusted to 6.4 with 0.5M HCl, and the mixture is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Precipitated protein is removed by centrifugation, and lysine HCl is added until a concentration of 0.55 mol l. An additional 8 by weight of PEG 3.000 is added, and pH is adjusted to 6.3 with 0.1M NaOH. After incubation for 45 minutes at room temperature the precipitate is isolated by centrifugation and is redissolved in 5 ml of citrate saccharose NaCl, pH 7.8. The concentrate contains 460 units Factor VIII C and 30 mg protein specific activity 15 units mg . Cryoprecipitate from 80 kg of plasma is redissolved in 2500 ml of citrate buffer and freed of prothrombin complex by adsorption with Al₂O₃. 4 by weight of PEG 3,000 is added. pH is adjusted to 6.4 with 0.5M HCl, and the mixture is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Precipitated protein is removed by centrifugation, and lysine HCl is added until a concentration of 0.55 mol l. An additional 8 by weight of PEG 3.000 is added, and pH is adjusted to 6.3 with 0.1M NaOH. After incubation for 45 minutes at room temperature the precipitate is isolated by centrifugation and is redissolved in 60 ml of citrate saccharose NaCl. The solution is sterile filtrated and dispensed into 15 vials. After freezing and freeze drying each vial contains 1000 units of AHF, with a specific activity of 37 units mg protein. It is evident to a skilled person that salting in agent effect on a PEG PEG precipitation can be obtained under other conditions than those stated in the foregoing. Thus, at a different pH and temperature other concentrations of PEG and salting in agent are to be used. The most expedient conditions can be determined by experiments.
