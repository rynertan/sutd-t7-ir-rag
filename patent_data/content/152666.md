# Method and apparatus for the clarification of sewage and other wastes.

## Abstract
A novel sewage purification system is provided herein. It includes a pump 13 for drawing sewage into the system and an injection inlet 15 for injecting a chemical into the effluent line 14 from the pump 13 . The pump 13 leads to a pair of interconnected, U shaped mixing chambers 71, 172 connected to the effluent line 14 from the pump 13 , the U shaped mixing chambers being baffled 181 and be ing of a particular construction. There is also a recycle line 45 from the inlet line to the mixing chambers 14 back to the pump 13 for recycling about 1 20 of the total flow rate, which is about 20 160 litres minute through the sys tem. The U shaped mixing chambers are also provided with at least two injection inlets 178, 180 for injecting chemicals thereinto. A splitter chamber 21 is connected to the outlet 19 from the mixing chambers 171, 172 to provide a pair of parallel flow outlets lines 25, 27 therefrom. A separator chamber 30 is connected to such parallel flow lines 25, 27 , the separator chamber 30 having structure 39, 42 therein for separating sludge therefrom and withdrawing it from the bottom thereof 41, 44 , and for withdrawing clean water from the upper central core thereof 35, 38 . Finally, a sludge removal line 44 is provided, along with a sludge recycle line 442 for recycling about 1 20 of the sludge back to the pump inlet line 12 .
