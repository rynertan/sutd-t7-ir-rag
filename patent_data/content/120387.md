# Method and apparatus for vectorizing documents and symbol recognition.

## Abstract
An apparatus codes a scanned document locally repres enting each graphic element within a prescribed mesure of accuracy by a trapezoidal approximation. The invention also includes a method for similarly coding a scanned document. The apparatus determines whether each scanned run is indi cative of a Y or Î» junction, the termination of an old, or the commencement of a new graphic element, and whether a new linear approximation is necessary. The invention is pre ferred embodiment recognizes symbols by determining the center of mass and maximum extremity of a symbol candi date, and comparing it to a reference library after normalizing with respect to scale, orientation and center of mass. In a preferred embodiment, an adaptive threshold parameter governs coding so as to reject noise and optimize a pair of linear predicters in a small number of scans. In a further preferred embodiment the accuracy of the linear predicters is refined so that the error is exponentially bounds.
