Such panel consists of a solid wood piece of blocks glued together and arranged in longitudinal rows with the blocks of one row staggered relative to the blocks of adjacent rows.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Such laminated panels are known but they are currently made iu accordance with a predetermined length and width by a discontinuous process. The individual glue coated wooden blocks must be manually laid out on the table of a press ram means press the blocks together along their edges to form the panel and then the pressing plate of the press is brought against the panel, said pressing plate being provided with an electrode fed with high frequency electricity to produce curing of the glue, normally a thermosetting resin such as urea glue. Such an apparatus and method for producing laminated panels is time consuming and the panels have a predetermined length which is unsuitable for certain applications.Such panels are normally used in cabinet work, in construction, in decoration and the like for instance stairway handrails and desk counters are often made from such laminated panels. The known apparatus and method have a limited production capacity since it is not a continuous operation and the individual wooden blocks must be arranged manually for each panel made. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is a main object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and a method for producing solid wood laminated panels in a continuous manner with the panel produced thereby having an undetermined length. Another object of the invention is the provision of a method and apparatus to produce solid wood laminated panels in a fast and effective manner, in which the longitudinal and transverse joints between the individual wooden pieces have a close and smooth fit.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The method of the invention is for obtaining a continuous laminated panel made of undivided solid wood blocks, glued together, arranged in longitudinal rows and offset transversely of the panel.The method comprises the steps of successively positioning groups of such blocks glue coated along at 1888ttUC adjacent edges at a feeding station at the rear end portion of an elongated table, the blocks of each group disposed side by side in a number equal to the number of said longitudinal rows and each aligned longitudinally of said table, the blocks of each group offset one from the other longitudinally of the table, successively pushing each group of so positioned blocks along said table transversely and forwardly of said table to abut the blocks of a succeeding group against the blocks of a preceding group, said pushing step being effected on a given group of blocks while the preceding groups of blocks are positively retained against movement transversely of said table and while they are braked in their forward movement longitudinally of said table, to press the blocks together and form close joints between the blocks, and heat curing the glue of the assembled and pressed blocks. The apparatus of the invention comprises an elongated table, mouable on the table at one end portion of the latter, said ram having a stepped ram edge and guide means to cause said ram to move while remaining parallel to itself transversely and forwardly of the table, said table having a longitudinal abutment shoulder along its edge opposite the ram member, pressing plates to press the assembled blocks against said table while they are being moved step by step by said ram member, one of said pressing plates having means to cure the glue, the apparatus preferably including a braking means at the outlet end of the apparatus to effect an increased braking pressure on the leading end of the assembled panel to increase the longitudinal pressure between the various blocks during the final stage of the forward stroke of the ram member.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ORAWINGS In the annexed drawings Figure 1 is a top plan view of the rear portion of the apparatus, the oprator s platform overlying the table not shown Figure 2,found on the second page of the drawings, is a top plan view of the front portion of the apparatus Figure 3 is a cross section taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a cross section taken along line 4 4 of Figure 2 Figure 5 is a cross section taken along line 5 5 of Figure 1 Figure 6, shown on the first page of the drawings, is a plan view corresponding to that of Figure 1 but showing the ram member in approximately the mid portion of its reciprocating movement Figure 7 is a cross sectional view on an enlarged scale cDr responding to a portion of Figure 5 and Figure 8 is a top partial plan view of the stacking racks taken along line 8 8 of Figure 7. DLTAJLED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the drawings, like reference characters indicate like elements throughout. The apparatus of the invention comprises an elongated table 1 having a rear portion 2 and a front portion 3 relative to the direction of movement of the solid wood laminated continuous panel A being made by the apparatus and consisting of elongated wood blocks 8, of uniform size and glued together. As shown in Figure 1, the rear portion 2 of the horizontal table carries a ram member 4 and a triangular pressing plate 5, which has a front transverse edge 6.The front portion of the table carries over the same a glue curing and pressing plate 7 having its rear edge terminated at the edge 6 of plate 5. Plate 7 is disposed in alignment with and forwardly of pressing plate 5. A braking plate 8 is arranged forwardly of the glue curing plate 7 and in alignment therewith. Ram member 4 is in the form of an elongated beam having a stepped forward edge 9 defined by a plurality of successive steps 10 extending transversely of the table and each equally spaced from the other longitudinally of the table, the imaginary line passing through the outer corners of each step 10 is straight and is inclined with respect to the table. The ram member 4 has an L shaped cross section, as shown inFigure 7, and is reinforced at its rear upstanding flange by a strip 11 while its horizontal flange is reinforced and made thicker by strips 12 and plate 13. The ram member slides on the table 1 in a reciprocating movement, being actuated by a double acting hydraulic cylinder piston unit 15 pivotally connected at 16 to the rear edge of the ram member and at 17 to a bracket 18 fixed to the table.During this reciprocating movement, the ram menlbor is maintained parallel to itself and ia guided in a pre tk determined path by means of at least two angular guide members 19 fixed to ram member and extending rearwardly of the same each guide member has a central angular slot 20 engaging a freely rotatable guide wheel 21, the shaft of which is secured to the top of table 1. The angular guides 19 are fixed at their free ends to reinforcing bars 22 and overlying bridging bars 22 . Bars 22 are fixed to the ram member 4. Each slot 20 has a forward portion 23 which is inclined with respect to the length of the table at about 300 while each slot 20 has a rear portion 24 which is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the table 1.The outermost rear end portion 25 of the guiding slot 20 ic curved to extend at a slight angle with respect to the long axis of the table 4. The forward end of the ram table forms a finger having a rounded end 26, which is engageable with a guide wheel 27 appropriately located and carried by the top of the table. In the retracted position of the ram member 4, as shown inFigure 1, its stepped edge 9 is rearwardly spaced from the inclined. rear edge 28 of triangular pressing plate 5 this space defines a feeding station for the solid wooden blocks 8. As shown in Figures 5, 7, and 8, there is disposed over said feeding station a stacking rack assembly,generally indicated at 29, for holding a plurality of stacks of elongated solid wood blocks B. The rack assembly 29 consists of upright angle irons 30 properly secured one to another and defining as many compartments as there are stacks of blocks B. These uprights are carried by beams 31, as shown inFigure 5, in turn secured to an operator 18 platform 32 overlying the ram member in its retracted position. Said operating platform 32 may be suspended from the room in which the device is located and is preferably provided with a handrail 33.As clearly shown inFigure 7, the lower end of the angle irons 30 of the rack is spaced upwardly from the table 1 a distance slightly greater than the thickness of the wooden blocks B so, upon forward movement of the ram member 4 from its retracted position, as shown in Figure 5, the lowermost blocks O of each stack will be engaged by the ram member and pushed laterally away from the rack assembly 29, as shown inFigure 7, while the next lowermost series of blocks will rest on the ram member 4. Each rack of the rack assembly 29 holds a stack of blocks B in longitudinal alignment with the table and in staggered position one with respect to the other, so as to conform with the longitudinal spacing of the steps 10 of the operating edge of the ram membor 4. Because the ram member 4 remains parallel to itself during its rciprocdtin movement, the stepped edge 9 of the ram member 4 remains substantially parallel to the inclined edge 28 of pressing plate 5. 5As shown in Figure, the pressing plate 5 is mounted for pivoting novemerlt to uncover the portion of the table underneath the same. Moro particularly, it is pivotally carried at 34 to the ends of arms 35 which are pivoted intermediate their ends on brackets 36 carried by the tnhle 1. The outer ends of the arms 35 are power actuated by means of douhle acting hydraulic cylinder and piston units 37 pivotally attached to said arms and to brackets 38 carried by the frame work 40 of the table 1. The hydraulic cylinder and piston units 37 serve also to press the pressing plate 5 against assembled wooden blocks B lying underneath and slidably supported by table 1. Similarly, the glue curing plate 7, shown in Figure 2 and also in ciD ss section in Figure 3, is mountod for swinging movement so as to uncove,r the table portion lying underneath the same. The same drrangemant of ornis 35, brackets 36 and double acting hydraulic cylinder and piston units 37 pivotally carried by brackets 38 are arranged for the glue curing plate 7. The same can be applied with pressure against the wooden blocks underlying the same. The glue curing plate 7 is provided with a flat electrode 41 coextensive with said plate 7 and fed with high frequency electricity by means of a cable 42 connected to a high frequency generator,generally indicated at 43 and of known construction.The braking plate 8, shown in Figures 2 and 4, also overlies the table and is secured to a frame 44 connected to double acting hydraulic cylinder and piston units 45, which are in turn pivotally connected to a support 46 carried by the table 1. Cylinder units 45 can raise and lower the braking plate 8 to press the same against the assembled wooden panel, so as to exert a braking force resisting the forward movement of the panel under the forward pressure exerted by the ram member 4. The table 1 is provided along its longitudinal edge opposite to the ram member 4 with a guiding and abutment shoulder 47 upstanding therefrom, said shoulder 47 being shown in Figures 1, 2, 5, and 6.Downstream from guiding roller 27 on the same side as the ram member, there is also provided a guide member 48 extending longitudinally of the table end having a rounded end 49 adJacent the guide roller 27. The machine operates as follows the solid wood blocks B to be used all have the same thickness and length and continuously placed in the rack assembly 29 by the operator standing on platform 32 during operation of the apparatus.These blocks are pre coated, at least along two right angle edges, with a thermo setting glue, such as urea glue. At the first forward stroke of the ram member 4, the lowermost wooden blocks B of the stacks in the rack assembly 2. and resting on the table 1 are first pushed diagonally and then forwardly and forwardly along the table and are inserted under pressing plate 5 in the position shown in Figure 1, wherein it is seen that their trailing ends protrude from edye 28 of pressing plate r8, Upon each successive forward stroke of ram member 4, a new group of blocks 8 is fed under plate 5, so as to press their longitudinal and forward edges against the corresponding edges of the already laid wooden blocks.Thus, the blocks are pressed together transversely of the table and eventually against the shoulder 47 on the opposite side of the table after the panel being assembled has attained its full width. When the ram member accomplishes its second forward stroke portion longitudinally of the table with the guide wheels 1 then engaging the straight portion 24 of the guide slots 20, the new group of wooden blocks pushes the previously assembled blocks on the table 1 against the resistance produced by pressing plate 5 and eventually by the glue curing plate 7 and, finally, by the braking plate 8. At the end of the forward stroke of the ram member, its rounded end 26 engages the guide wheel 27 while the guide wheels 21 engage the outer ends 25 of the guide slots 20, whereby the ram member is again moved transversely of the table to effect a final transverse pressure on the blocks against shoulder 47. Once the assembled blocks reach underneath the glue curing plate 7, the glue is cured by the high frequency electric field produced between electrode 41 and steel table 1. The assembled blocks move step by step at each forward stroke of the ram member. The braking member 8 exerts its braking force during the last two thirds of the forward longitudinal stroke of the ram member. The endEMI8.1 of the forward stroke of the ram member initiates the high frequency to start the glue curing cycle. Completion of the cycle initiates the backward stroke and the succeeding forward stroke of ram member 4. The assembled moving blocks B move step by step through the apparatus and the final laminated panel A is of continuous length and the glue is completely cured. Because of the lateral pressure exerted on the assembled b3ocks by the ram member and the longitudinal compression exerted by the ram mamber and the braking device 8, the longitudinal and transverse joints in panel 8 have a close and smooth fit. A cross saw may be installed close to the discharge end of the machine to cut off thebevelled leading end of the panel and to cut the latter into desired lengths. In the finished panel A, the blocks B are longitudinally aligned with respect to the machine in several longitudinal rows, and the blocks B of each row are longitudinally offset with respect to the blocks of an adjacent row, prefably by about 1 3 of the length of an individual block.
