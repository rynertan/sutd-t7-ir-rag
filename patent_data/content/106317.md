# Purification of fluorinated lubricants free from hydrogen.

## Abstract
There is proposed a process for the purification of fluorinated lubricants, free from hydrogen, such as perf luorinated ethers or chlorofluorocarbons, whose elimination can be dangerous for the environment owing to the fluorine release, such a process consisting in dissolving the lubricant in a fluorochlorinated hydrocarbon, then in precipitating it by means of a grease solvent, in separating, in degasing and finally in filtering in order to remove the mechanical impurities.
