## Description
This invention relates to a novel instrument and a novel technique for covalent immobilization of molecules having an available amino group. In particular, the invention has application to the detection and quantification of proteins present in low concentrations in body fluids such as serum and, more particularly, to the immobilization of antibodies and antigens to facilitate quantification of antigenic substances by an immunoassay technique. The determination of the presence or concentration of antigenic substances in serum or other body fluids at low concentrations relies increasingly upon immunoassay techniques, which take advantage of the fact that an antibody binds specifically to its antigen and the reaction obeys the law of mass action, Ab Ag AbAg . Various immunoassay techniques are currently employed and can be classified by their binding characteristics. The most commonly used is competitive binding assays and non competitive sandwich assays.Regardless of the technique, a labelled antibody or antigen conjugate must be employed for detection. The most widely used labels are radioisotopes, enzymes and fluorescent compounds and the procedure is called radioimmunoassay RIA , enzyme immunoassay EIA and fluorescent immunoassay FIA , respectively. Radioimmunoassays utilizing the radioactive isotopes 1251, 1 C or 3H as labels are still the most widely used assays because of their extremely high sensitivities. Many of these RIAs can detect as little as 10 16 moles of antigen or antibody. Despite their high sensitivity, RIAs suffer from a number of disadvantages due to the hazardous nature of the high energy gamma and beta isotopes used in these assays and problems in radioactive waste disposal. In recent years, there have been many attempts to devise new enzyme and fluorescent immunoassay systems which are as sensitive and as rapid as RIAs but which utilize enzymes or fluorescent compounds instead of radioactivity as the means for monitoring the antigen antibody binding reaction. Since their first description by Engwall andPerlman in Immunochemistry 8 871 1971 , methods have been developed using enzymes as the labelling compound examples of which are those found in U.S. Patent Numbers 3,654,090, 3,791,932, 3,839,153, 3,850,752, 3,879,262 and those described in the Journal of Immmunological Methods 1 247 1972 and in Methods of Enzymology 70 419 1980 . Each of the above described methods is based on heterogenous EIA methodology which involves the separation of the reacted enzyme labelled component from the unreacted enzyme labelled conjugate by washing These assays are particularly suitable for the detection and measurement of antigens or antibodies or other substances present in the body fluids which have molecular weights larger than 10,000. Also of interest are homogenous enzyme immunoassays described in Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 47 846 1972 and in U.S. Patent Number 3,817,837. In these assays a hapten is linked to an enzyme in such a manner that the enzyme activity is altered when the hapten combines with the antibody. No separation steps are required in homogenous EIAs and thus these methods are usually very rapid. These assays are used most widely for measuring therapeutic drug levels, for assaying drugs of abuse and for determination of other antigenic substances with molecular weight lower than 10,000. Fluorescent immunoassays have sensitivities similar to those of RIAs. As high and variable blanks are quite often encountered, this method appears to be less reliable than RIAs. Several representative RIA methodologies are described in Methods of Enzymology 74 3, 28, 60, 78 and 87 1981 and in U.S. Patent Number 3,901,654. Chemiluminescence has also been utilized in immunoassay procedures. Chemiluminescence refers to light produced as a result of chemical change. It involves the transformation of the free energy of a chemical reaction into light energy. A well known chemiluminescent reaction is the oxidation of luminol 5 amino 1, 4 dihydroxyphthalazine in a basic solution using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant and in 3 2 2 the presence of a catalyst e.g. Fe , Cu or Co . Some exemplary methods of chemiluminescent immunoassays are described in U.S. Patent Numbers 4,104,029, 4,375,972 and 4,380,580. Electron spin resonance as a labelling means in immunoassay procedures has been described in U.S. PatentNumber 3,850,578. This method requires relatively expensive instrumentation and free electron bearing labels which are potentially carcinogenic compounds. Enzyme immunoassays have found increasing application not only in the fields of clinical analysis but also in microbiology, virology, biochemistry, tissue culturing and immunology. These assays are typically carried out in 96 well 8 x 12 array plastic microtiter dishes for their convenience of manual handling of large numbers of tests in parallel. The wells volume 0.3 ml function as spectrophotometer curvettes with the absorbance of their individual contents being read through the vertical axis by high speed colourimeters having automatic X Y transport and indexing mechanism. Virtually all commercial microtiter dish ElAs are heterogenous immunoassays and they employ physical adsorption of the primary antibody or antigen to the solid surface of the wells.Although varying with the tertiary structure of the individual antibodies or antigens, 2 relatively low binding densities of about 1 to 200 ng cm are attained through weak hydrophobic interactions of the Van derWaals London type between the protein and the polymer.Despite the apparent limitations of assaying range and inaccuracy imposed by low binding density and variable desorption of the antibody antigen complex, adsorptive binding of antibodies and antigens remains widely used in heterogenous competitive RIAs as well as in sandwich typeEIAs and FIAs. Some methods have been recently described to attach an antibody or an antigen through covalent linkage to a solid phase, e.g. to polystyrene beads as reported in the Journal of Immunological Methods 34 315 1980 . In this procedure, polystyrene beads were nitrated and reduced with an alkaline solution of sodium dithionite to generate an aminopolystyrene surface. The beads were activated with glutaraldehyde and used to covalently bind the antibody. These beads, bearing covalently immobilized antibody, were subsequently used in sandwich type immunoassays. Higher surface density of the antibody, shorter incubation times, improved accuracy and range were noted in these assays using covalently bound antibody polystyrene beads.In a similar procedure, described in the Journal of Immunological Methods 57 87 1983 , Sc his tos oma mans on i ant i gen 5 were covalent ly attached to the surface of the wells of 96 well polystyrene microtiter dishes which were used later in enzyme immunoassays for the antibody determination in patients sera. In this work, an aminopolystyrene surface was generated in the wells via the nitration reaction with a mixture of fuming nitric acid in glacial acetic acid and further reduction with alkaline sodium dithionite. The antige.n.ic proteins were coupled to this aminopolystyrene surface with N ethylb 3 dimethylaminopropyl3 carbodiimide and suberic acid acting as a short chain coupling molecule to couple a single protein. This report again shows higher sensitivity of the assays carried out with the covalently bound antigens compared to the ones with the physically adsorbed antigens. The present Invention provides a novel method and means for the covalent immobilization of molecules, such as antibodies or antigens, to surfaces of various polymers and provides an instrument that in immunoassay application provides a linear assay relationship over a wide range of concentrations of the substance to be detected and quantified. The invention can also be utilized to immobilize for assay or production purposes any molecule that has an active amino group. For example, it can be used for enzyme immobilization, DNA immobilization, cell immobilization, virus immobilization, bacteria immobilization or in affinity chromatography. The instrument of the invention takes the form of plastic structures, e.g. vials, curvettes, beads, 96 well microtiter dishes, to which, in immunoassay applications, antibodies can be covalently immobilized in a novel way and used in heterogenous enzyme or fluorescence immunoassays more conveniently than the structures of the prior art where only adhesive protein binding had been utilized and more accurately than existing covalent linkage systems. In the present invention, for example an antibody protein used in the sandwich enzyme or fluorescence immunoassay as the unlabelled antibody, can be covalently immobilized to a polymeric surface by covalently bonding it to a long spacer molecule which is itself covalently attached to the polymer surface. The long spacer moleculer is polymer that has been synthesized and attached covalently to the polymer surface by chemically or photochemically initiated cografting using two or more appropriate monomers and a free radical initiating system. One of the monomers has the structure CH2 CRWZ where the group Z can chemically react with reactive amino acid groups of the protein which thus becomes covalently attached to the spacer molecule.The second monomer provides spacing of the active groups Z along the spacer molecule and has a structure of CH2 CRY where the group Y is a group that can provide the desired hydrophilicity of the long spacer molecule. The cografting of the above monomers can be done in various solvents or mixtures of them at temperatures ranging from zero degreesCelsius in the case of photochemically initiated cografting techniques, and from 40 degrees Celsius in the case of chemically initiated cografting techniques, up to the boiling point temperatures of these solvents in an inert atmosphere.After the grafting is finished, the grafted plastic structures are washed to remove the unreacted monomers, non grafted pp lymers, organic solvents and residues of the initiating compounds. The antibody is then covalently immobilized to the activated spacer molecules in an aqueous buffered solution. The plastic structures containing the immobilized antibody are after neutralizing the residual active groups on the spacer molecules dried and can be used in the sandwich type or competitive types of enzyme or fluorescence immunoassays. Accordingly, the invention provides a surface treated polymeric substrate for use in immobilizing molecules containing available amino groups. The substrate has a plurality of a synthesized polymer bonded to it, the polymer comprising a mixture of at least two monomers, one of which contains an active group available for bonding with the amino groups in the molecules to be immobilized whereby multiple active groups are dispersed on the polymers and spaced from the substrate. The invention provides a method for producing this substrate polymer combination and for its particular use in immunoassay techniques. With the present invention, therefore, in immunoassay applications, the polyclonal adhesively immobilized antibody presently used in a heterogenous enzyme or fluorescence immunoassay for an antigenic substance is replaced by an antibody covalently immobilized through a long spacer molecule which is itself covalently bound to a polymeric support. The invention is thereby useful for the determination of the concentration or the presence of a wide variety of antigenic substances present in body fluids or other biological materials. The invention will be described herein with reference to immobilizing antigens and antibodies as in immunoassay techniques. Therefore, the term antigen or antigenic substance, as used herein, refers generally to substances to which polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies can be produced against.Among the specific antigens which may be assayed by the process of the present invention may be mentioned human IgG, human IgM, human IgA, mouse IgG and human fibrinogen. The present invention is also useful for the covalent immobilization of the antigens which may be used in various homogenous competitive radioimmunoassays, enzyme immunoassays and fluorescence immmunoassays. An example of the specific antigens covalently immobilized by the present invention is protein A. However, the invention can be utilized to bind to a plastic substrate and thereby immobilize for assay purposes, production purposes, etc., molecules that possess an available amino binding group. For example, the invention can be utilized to covalently immobilize polypeptides or polysaccharides, or proteins such as an enzyme, DNA, virus or bacteria, or cells. These and other features of the invention will be readily apparent fron the following description of preferred embodiments thereof, tereof, with reference to tbe accommanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a scheme illustrating the cografting procedure for the formation of the long spacer molecules covaKlently attached to the polymer surface and the covalent immobXlization of an antibody via the activated spacer molecule. Figure 2 illustrates the results obtained using convent.nal adhesively bound polyclonal antibodies in three enzyme .ttmunoassays for mouse IgG and human IgG and IgM.Plots for absorbance vs. log of the antigen concentration with the antard error bars 3 are shown. Figure 3 illustrates the results obtained using the invention, covalently immobilized polyclonal antibodies on long spacers, in three enzyme immunoassays for mouse IgG and human IgG and IgM. Plots for absorbance vs. log concentration with the standard error bars 3 Q are shown. As indicated, the invention will be illus treated with reference to the immobilization of antibodies or antigens. The general method, en.bodYing the invention, for the covalent attachment of antibodies or antigens to the polymeric surface through a spacer molecule is shown inFigure 1 . The main feature of this procedure is not only the use of covalent bonds to, in the end, link the polymer surface and an antibody for its irreversible immobilization but the spacing of the antibody molecule from the polymer surface through a synthesized chain molecule which is described herein as a spacer molecule. As will be detailed, the spacer molecule is formed by cografting several types of monomers to provide a chain polymer which is covalently bonded to the polymer surface of a plastic substrate. One of the monomers provides active sites Z that are dispersed along the spacer molecule and covalently bond to the antibody. The antigen to be measured can then be bonded to the antibody and the tracer or labelled antibody tagged to the antigen for assay purposes. An antibody molecule linked by a long up to several hundred Angstroms long spacer molecule to the polymer surface behaves much more like a dissolved molecule with increased freedom of translation and rotation in contrast to an adsorbed antibody molecule which is practically immobilized on the polymer surface. The higher translational and rotational freedom of the spaced, but immobilized, antibody molecule improves the kinetics of the antigen binding in a typical competitive immunoassay. This effect is even more dramatic in an enzyme sandwich type assay where the presence of the second antibody conjugated with an enzyme further increases steric crowding around the sandwich complex. In this procedure, the incubation time for the antigen binding and for the second antibody enzyme conjugate can be significantly reduced without a noticeable deterioration of the assaying results. Importantly, this invention in addition permits excellent control of the density of the covalently immmobilized antibodies or antigens on the polymer surface.The protein surface density of antibodies and antigens obtained in the adhesive binding vary greatly and is a function of the protein structure, its concentration used in the coating solution, the temperature and the pH at which the adsorption procedure is carried out and the surface structure of the plastic to which these antibodies or antigens are adsorbed to. Adhesive binding of the type practiced ih the prior art typically produces acceptable densities of the antibodies on the plastic surfaces although at a cost of usually low utilization yield. The adhesive binding of antigens, particularly those of low molecular weight, is more unreliable and the low surface antigen densities can seriously effect the sensitivity and dynamic range of these essays.As shown in Figure 1, the antibody or antigen molecules containing free amino groups from the lysine residues react with an active group Z on the spacer molecule creating a covalent bond which permanently immobilizes the protein molecules. In this procedure, therefore, the yield of bound antibody or antigen is significantly increased compared to the prior art s adhesive binding and, moreover, may be easily controlled by a quenching reaction of the reactive Z groups on the spacer molecules. Further, the invention permits better control of nonspecific protein binding as compared to the prior art. The nonspecific binding of proteins, e.g. antibody enzyme conjugates, is a well documented phenomenon and is probably one of the major contributors of errors in heterogenous immunoassays. In standard adhesive enzyme and fluorescence immunoassays, the nonspecific protein binding is suppressed by using a high concentration of an appropriate protein, e.g.bovine serum albumin BSA or porcine gelatin, in all assay solutions to saturate the plastic surface and reduce the nonspecific binding of the antibody enzyme or antibody fluorophor conjugates. Saturation of the surface with the BSA molecules increases the steric crowding around the antibody antigen complex thus decreasing the binding of the antibody enzyme conjugate which in turn reduces the sensitivity of the immunoassay. However, in the present invention, the antibody or antigen molecules are covalently linked to the polymer surface through the long spacer molecule which effectively spaces them from the surface saturated with BSA or gelatin and therefore Introducing negligible steric crowding. Moreover, through use of appropriate monomers in the forming of the spacer molecules, the spacer molecules are of hydrophilic nature which in itself discourages the nonspecific binding. The covalent binding of antibodies or antigens to polymeric plastic structures in the present invention is a two step process. As shown in Figure 1, the spacer molecules are first formed on the surface of the plastic structures by a procedure of the chemically or photochemically initiated cografting of two or mor e mon omers and is followed by the covalent coupling of the antibody or the antigen to the spacer molecules.One of the monomers which is cografted into the spacer molecule and in turn onto the polymer surf ace is preferably a vinyl monomer with a general structure CH2 CR1 W Z The group R1 is a hydrogen or a methyl group or an aliphatic or an aromatic group containing up to sixteen carbon atoms and preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The group Z contains an active ester group and consists essentially of the general structure EMI14.1 The groups R3 and R4 are hydrogen, or hydrocarbon groups having up to sixteen carbon atoms, and preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in structures that are aliphatic, aromatic or both aliphatic and aromatic and which can contain heteroatoms of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, fluorine, bromine and chlorine.Groups R3 and Rh may be bonded together or not bonded together and may when bonded form together an aromatic group. One preferable structure for group Z would contain an active ester grpup in the following general formulaEMI14.2 in which n is 1, 2 or 3. The group W which links the Z group to the vinyl group contains up to sixteen carbon atoms, although again preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in aromatic, aliphatic or combinations of aromatic and aliphatic structures and can also contain heteroatoms of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. The above mentioned active esters, which are derivatives ofN diacylhydroxylamines, are known to react easily with the amino groups on lysine residues in proteins forming amide derivatives through which the protein molecule is covalently coupled to the group bearing the active ester. This amide forming reaction has an optimal pH range between pH 7.5 to 8.5 and is known to have a very high ratio of aminolysisi hydrolysis which is about 10 , and therefore guarantees high yield of the amide formation even at very low protein concentrations.Another good feature of the active ester groups is that they may be easily quenched by the ammonium ion or other primary amino group containing compounds thus allowing reasonably good control of the protein binding. The second monomer which is cografted into the spacer molecule has a general formula CH 2 CR2 Y where R2 is hydrogen, a methyl group, an aliphatic or an aromatic group containing up to sixteen carbon atoms, and preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The group Y is an aliphatic and or aromatic hydrocarbon group having up to sixteen carbon atoms and can contain heteroatoms of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. The group provides spacing between the active Z groups on the spacer molecule and provides desired hydrophilicity in the spacer molecule. Preferably the Y group is an aliphatic group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.Typically, when relatively hydrophilic spacers are required, the group Y will contain hydroxyl, amide, carboxyl or similar hydrophilic groups. A third monomer can also be cografted into the spacer molecule and has a general structure of CH2 CR5 X R5C CH2 Where R5 is a hydrogen, a methyl group, an aliphatic or an aromatic group containing up to sixteen carbon atoms, and again 1 to 6 carbon atoms is preferable. The X group contains up to sixteen carbon atoms in aromatic, aliphatic or combinations of aromatic and aliphatic structures and can contain heteroatoms of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur.Preferably as well, the X group will contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms. These divinyl compounds are added as crosslinking or branching agents and effect the structure of the spacer molecules. The molar ratio of the monomers CH2 CR1 W Z, CH2 CR2 Y and CH2 CR5 X R5C CH2, present in the grafting procedure does determine the number and the spacing of active groups binding sites on the spacer molecule, its hydrophilicity and its crosslinking. It will be apparent that this method will produce in a more spacious environment binding sites that are necessary enabling accurate measurement of high concentrations of material. The chemically initiated grafting process is initiated with free radical generating compounds like azo compounds, organic peroxides and peroxyesters. All these compounds decompose at certain temperatures g enerating free radical species which will initiate the polymerization and the grafting reactions. These chemically initiated grafting procedures are done at temperatures ranging from 40 degreesCelsius up to the boiling point temperatures of the solvents used in the process. The most suitable solvents are those which have good solubility and inertness for the monomers and do not dissolve or swell the grafted plastic structure and have a boiling point above 50 degrees Celsius. Examples of the classes of solvents that may be used are alcohols, ethers, esters and ketones.All grafting procedures must be carried out in an inert atmosphere, typically in nitrogen or argon at atmospheric or increased pressure. The reaction times vary but are typically between two hours and ten hours. The photochemically initiated grafting process usesUV radiation and photoactive free radical generating compounds like aromatic ketones. These compounds absorb UV radiations of a certain wavelength in high quantum yield and generate free radical species which will initiate the grafting and polymerization reactions. One preferred UV radiation for use in this invention is near ultraviolet which lies between 320 and 400 nanometers, but preferably around 360 nanometers. This region of the UV spectrum is easily generated with black light fluorescent lamps or high pressure mercury or xenon lamps. Typically, the energy density of theUV irradiations used in this invention range between 25 Whlm 2 and 100 Wh m .The pbotografting procedures are done at temperatures from 0 degrees Celsius up to the boiling temperature of the solvent used in the process. The same classes of solvents as used in chemically initiated grafting are also used in photografting procedures, rust notably alcohols, ethers, esters, and ketones. The referred photoinitiating compound has been found to be lenzophenone with its triplet energy ET of 67 Kcal mol. nert atmosphere is also typically obtained with nitrogen or argon at atmospheric pressure. The reaction times vary but typically between 10 minutes and two hours. The grafted plastic structures are then washed with an organic solvent and deionized water to remove the precipitated copolymer, organic solvent, the unreacted monomers and the decomposition products of the initiating compounds. The grafted plastic structures are typically used immediately for binding of the antibody or the antigen but alternatively can simply be dried in vacuum, sealed into a polyethylene bag and stored refrigerated. When stored under anhydrous conditions, the grafted plastic has been found to remain active for the covalent immobilization of antibodies or antigens for at least six months. Typical plastic substances used are polystyrene polyvinylchloride, polyethyiene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, and polyacrylate. The covalent coupling of antibodies or antigens to the spacer molecule is carried out in aqueous, non nucleophilic buffered solutions at pH preferably between 7.5 and 8.5 temperatures ranging from 0 degrees Celsius up to 37 degrees Celsius. The reaction times again range as short as one hour and up to eighteen hours. The protein concentrations in the coupling solutions may be as low as 100 ng ml but in general for antibodies they are kept around 5 ug ml. The surface passivation of the antibody Cr antigen coated plastic surfaces is done with solutions containing bovine serum albumin or egg albumin or non ionic detergent R like Tween 20 or mixtures of them. Sometimes it is advantageous to include some ammonium ion in the passivation solution to quench the residual active ester groups on the spacer molecules.The antibody or antigen coated plastic structures may be freeze dried and stored under anhydrous conditions and at sub zero temperatures for at least twelve months. With the bonded structure of the invention not only can higher concentrations of matter be captured for measurement, but the optical tran sparency of the substrate is preserved in higher concentration applications thereby enabling accurate measurement of the bonded matter being assayed. The enzyme immunoassays for mouse IgG , human IgA, human IgG, human IgM and human fibrinogen exemplified below were performed by using polyclonal goat or rabbit antibodies.All the assays are of the sandwich type using a second antibody enzyme conjugate with a photometric or fluorometric determination of the product formed by the enzymatic catalysis. The antibo dy enzyzne conjugates used are either with alkaline phosphatase with p nitrophenylphosphate as the substrate or horseradish peroxidase with 2,2 azino di 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonate ABTS R as the chromogen.Alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used with the fuorescent substrate 4 methylumbelliferyl phosphate. For the photometric determinations of the enzyme products theDynatech MR600 96 well plate reader was used. Fluorescent assays were carried out in a Dynatech Microfluor 96 well plate reader. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, a side by side comparison of the enzyme immunoassays for mouse IgG and humanIgG and IgM carried out in 96 well plates coated with an antibody by adsorption and in covalently immobilized plates as described provides instant recognition that adsorbed antibody assays degenerate in the high antigen concentration range. The usable assaying range as indicated by overlapping error bars in the plots of Figure 2 is 0.8 ng to 20 ng of the antigen for adsorptively coated plates. In the covalently coated plates as shown in Figure 3, the usable assaying range is extended from 0.8 ng to 200 ng of the antigen.Moreover, the error bars 3 are significantly smaller with the covalently immobilized antibodies due to the higher antibody concentration and their permanent immobilization on the polymeric surface as well as because of lesser steric crowding due to the long spacer molecules immobilizing them and providing them with a much higher freedom for mobility. It will be apparent that the grafted polymeric substrates can be utilized in any type ofAssay technique to identify and measure any matter that contains an active amino group that will bind to the active groups sited on the spacer molecule, i.e. the active ester group, or in immunoassay techniques. It matters not what type of labelling is employed and whether enzyme, fluorescence radioactive or luminiscence immunoassay is used. In addition, the invention could be used in other applications where immobilization of such a molecule is required, for example DNA alteration.
