# Non pneumatic tire.

## Abstract
A tire having an annular body 16 of resilient elastomeric material with an outer cylindrical member 18 at the outer pe riphery thereof which may carry a tread and a coaxial, coexten sive inner cylindrical member 22 at the inner periphery thereof for mounting on a wheel rim. The outer cylindrical member is supported and cushioned by a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart rib members 26 and one or more web members 32 . The rib members extend generally axially along the inner and outer cylindrical members and are inclined at an angle of 15 to 75 to radial planes which intersect them at their radial ly inner ends, and each web member preferably lies in a plane that is perpendicular to the rotational axis of the tire or, alterna tively, may either take the form of a frustrum of a right circular cone having as its principal axis the rotational axis of the tire or may form a partial helix about the rotational axis of the tire. The inner and outer cylindrical members, rib members and web member s are integral with or otherwise fastened to one an other. One half of the axial length of the rib members may be inclined to one of the intersecting radial planes and the other half of the axial length of the rib members may be inclined to the opposite side of the intersecting planes. Methods for mak ing the tire and fastening it to the wheel rim are also disclosed.
