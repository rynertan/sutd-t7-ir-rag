## Description
This invention relates to methods of manufacturing single crystals of BaPb BaPb Growing single crystals of BaPb In another method,a non stoichiometric solution of PBO₂ Bi₂O₃ BaPBO₃ is used. In this case, there is an advantage that the inclusion of impurities will be greatly reduced, but, when crystallising from a non stoichiometric solution, control of the composition, i.e. x, that determines the characteristics of the resulting crystal, will be very difficult. Also, strains accompanying the phase transition occur as stated above. The above methods are disclosed in Akinori Katsui Japanese Journal of Applied Physics Vol. 21 No. 9 1982 Page 553 to 554. With the conventional methods of manufacturing single crystals of BaPb The above disadvantages of the prior art methods are caused by crystallisation from a solution which has high viscosity and large composition change, at a very high temperature. The present invention seeks to provide a method of manufacturing a single crystal of BaPb According to the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing a single crystal of BaPb The aqueous solution may be alkali chloride, e.g. sodium chloride or potassium chloride or an alkali hydroxide, e.g. sodium hydroxide. The aqueous solution may include an oxygen generating compound such as a peroxide compound or potassium chloride. In one embodiment a single crystal of BaPB The invention is illustrated, merely by way of example, in the accompanying drawings, in which In hydrothermal synthesis, the starting material is dissolved in a solution of an appropriate solvent at appropriate temperature and pressure, and the intended crystal is grown on a suitable substrate. The growth temperature is generally from 300 C to 600 C, this temperature being very low compared to the temperatures used in the prior art. By selecting a suitable combination of temperature, pressure, and the appropriate solvent, and controlling the starting material and the substrate on which the crystal is grown, a single crystal with very little defects can be produced. The following are Examples of the present invention. Commercially available high purity BaCO₃, PbO₂, Bi₂O₃ were used as the starting materials and adjustment of the amount thereof was effected so that the super conductive composition BaPb For the hydrothermal process, a test tube type autoclave 8 of stelite 25 was utilised. Figure 3 is a sectional diagram showing the structure of the autoclave. The autoclave 8 has a cover 10 with a seal ring 9. The measurement of the temperature within the autoclave is through a temperature measuring hole 11. A gold capsule with a diameter of 3mm or 5mm was utilised in the autoclave, a powder sample of BaPb As the solvent, 3 mol NaCl aqueous solution, 3 mol KCl aqueous solution, and 3 mol NaOH aqueous solution were used with different samples. The hydrothermal process was conducted for 7 days at a pressure of 1000 Kg cm², at a temperature of 410 to 450 C. The results are shown in Table 1. It was observed that, with any of the above solvents, the samples were dissolved and re precipitated, and crystals were grown. The same result was obtained with any of the samples of composition x 0.21, x 0.27. When each of the resulting crystals was powdered and identified using an X ray diffractometer, it was observed that all are BaPb Example 1 was repeated utilising 4.5 mol KCl aqueous solution as the solvent, at a temperature of 300 to 450 C. The results are shown in Table 2. When the temperature was 350 C, neither dissolution nor re crystallisation was observed and the sample remained in the lower part of the gold capsule. However, when the temperature was above 400 C, the sample dissolved and re crystallised, crystals with a diameter of about 2mm being grown. The same result can be obtained with samples with composition x 0.21, or x 0.27. When the temperature was 450 C, even larger crystals were obtained but occasionally twin crystals were produced, the crystal surface being coarse with many secondary grains attached onto it. These defects are thought to occur because secondary nucleation generates upon cooling. When the resulting crystals were powdered and identified using an X ray diffractometer, it was observed that they were all BaPb Therefore, x 0.21 of the powder sample changed to x 0.20 in the single crystal and x 0.27 changed to x 0.25, but the change was minute for practical purposes. Figure 1 shows a test tube type autoclave 1 used in this Example. The autoclave is of stelite 25, but had a platinum inner lining to avoid contamination through impurities. The autoclave 1 was pressure sealed with a cover 3, through a seal ring 2. A nutrient 4 was mounted at the bottom of the autoclave. This nutrient 4 was obtained by grinding and powdering BaPb After completion of the hydrothermal process, the autoclave was rapidly cooled, to prevent the generation of secondary nucleation. As a result, a thin film with a uniform thickness was formed on the substrate 6. When this thin film was examined using an X ray diffractometer as in Example 1, it was identified as a single crystal of BaPb Example 4 was similar to Example 3 but a different solvent was used. The conditions were as follows temperature of the substrate 6 360 C temperature of the nutrient 4 400 C solvent aqueous solution which is 4.5 mol aqueous KCl solution to which 2 of the total weight of 2.0 mol KClO₃ aqueous solution is added pressure 1000 Kg cm² growth period 7 days. As in Example 3, the autoclave was quenched after completion of the hydrothermal process. In this Example, a thin film was also formed on the 001 surface of the SrTiO₃ substrate. This thin film was confirmed using an X ray diffractometer to be BaPb As stated above, compared to the conventional KCl flux method or the crystallisation method from a non stoichiometric solution, with the present invention there is a very low level of potassium ion impurities in the crystals because this process utilised low viscosity KCl aqueous solution at a relatively low temperature of 400 to 450 C. Also, as the appearance of super conductivity of the single crystals of BaPb With any method, by obtaining complete crystals with uniform composition x, the improvement of super conductivity is confirmed, and its effect is very large. Also, on the industrial side, because the process is carried out at a temperature of approximately 400 C, it is very easy to develop an industrial technique for manufacturing industrially single crystals using a hydrothermal process. It will be appreciated from the above discussion that BaPb
