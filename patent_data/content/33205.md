# Device for detecting broken heads of knitting machine needles.

## Abstract
Device for a knitting machine operative to detect knitting needles 15 , having broken heads and to actuate a stop motion 38 to shut down the machine. The device includes a needle sensing unit 30 connected electrically to the stop motion 38 and having a retractable sensor element 32 for sensing broken needles, and a needle deflecting roller 45 for deflecting unbroken needles away from the needle sensor element 32 . An adjustable support bracket 21 mounts the needle sensing unit 30 and needle deflecting roller 45 on a knitting machine to locate the needle deflecting roller 45 in the needle path to contact the hooks 18 of unbroken needles 15 and to locate the needle sensor element 32 in the needle path to contact the stems 19 of broken needles 15 . Needles having broken heads are not deflected by the needle deflect ing roller 45 but are sensed by the needle sensing unit 30 to activate the stop motion 38 .
