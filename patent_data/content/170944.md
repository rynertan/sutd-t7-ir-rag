# Power supply circuit of switching regulator type.

## Abstract
A power supply circuit of switching regulator type in cludes a converter transformer defined by a first winding for receiving input power from a DC source and second winding for producing output power, a switching transistor for alter nately making and breaking electric connection between the DC source and the first winding by alternate turn on and off op erations of the switching transistor, and a rectifying circuit connected to the second winding for rectifying the output power. A power supply circuit further includes a first error de tector for detecting a drift in the rectified output DC current and for producing a first control signal, a second error detector for detecting a drift in the rectified output DC voltage and for producing a second control signal, and a controller for control ling the on and off operations of the switching transistor based on either one of the first control signal and the second control signal so as to stabilize the rectified output power.
