# Tracheostomy apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method are provided for performing percutaneous or non dissection tracheostomies. An outer needle 10 coaxially slidably receives an inner needle 20 which is attached to a syringe 24 adapted for use in inserting the needles 10,20 within the tracheal lumen 26 . Operation of the syringe 24 confirms proper location of the needles 10,20 within the lumen 26 . An elongated dilator 30 coaxially slidably mounts a trachea tube 42 , and its proximal extremity constitutes an introducer portion 36 which tapers to a distal end 40 to which is attached an elongated, flexible leader 50 adapted for insertion through a bore 18 of the outer needle 10 subsequent to withdrawal of the inner syringe needle 20 . A slot 16 in the outer needle 10 enables lateral separation of the leader 50 from the outer needle 10 to allow removal of the outer needle 10 from the trachea 26 . The dilator 30 includes a recessed cutting edge 46 for cutting tissue compressed against it during forcible insertion of the introducer portion 36 into the tracheal lumen 26 along the path defined by the leader 50 . The dilator 30 is slidably removable to leave the tracheal tube 42 in breathing position.
