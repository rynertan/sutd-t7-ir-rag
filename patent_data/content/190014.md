## Description
This invention relates to an endoscopic device comprising dilator members and including a means to illuminate the body cavity being examined. The problem of illuminating a body cavity, such as the throat, the vaginal cavity and the rectal cavity, by means of an endoscope has been one that has faced the medical profession for years. Various kinds of medical apparatus have been proposed for use by physicians in the past to illuminate the interior of different body cavities undergoing inspection and examination. For example, there have been illumination devices provided for examination of the ears, the rectal cavity, the bladder, and the urinary tract. However, such devices often pose problems related to sterilisation prior to use and disposability following use. Further, these devices have not been generally used by the medical profession for vaginal examination and are, in fact, not readily adaptable for such. The illumination devices which have been proposed in conjunction with specula for vaginal examination have been generally unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons. In many cases they obstruct the vision of the deep internal parts of the vaginal cavity, fail to satisfactorily illuminate the deep interior of the cavity, and, in almost all cases, the proposed device requires sterilisation with the speculum or is designed to come into contact with the body cavity so that it must be sterilised with each use. Finally, most, if not all, known illumination devices utilise an electric light source to provide the illumination needed, thereby subjecting the patient to the possibility of electric shock and the heat of an incandescent light source in a sensitive area. U.S. Patent No. 4,184,193 relates to a lantern including a chemiluminescent lightstick. U.S. Patent No. 3,716,047 describes a disposable light conductive speculum comprising a pair of dilatory blade members and a fiber optic light source, the fiber optic light source being located in one of said dilator blade members and the power for such source being contained within the handle or leg portion of the dilator blade member associated therewith. As is well known, an endoscope is ordinarily an instrument, including a light source, for illuminating and thus permitting examination of, the interior of a body cavity. As is also well known, a speculum is a device for dilating and maintaining open a body cavity to permit examination thereof. A speculum equipped with the medical examination light of the invention, may be considered to be an endoscope, and is so considered herein. The term endoscopic device , as used herein, is intended to cover both endoscopes provided with dilator members and specula provided with the medical examination light according to claim 1. It is an object of the invention to provide an endoscopic device adapted to satisfactorily illuminate the body cavity being examined which is simple in construction and, which does not introduce any electrical current into the body cavity or surrounding areas being examined. It is a preferred object of the invention to provide an endoscopic device which can be made, although not necessarily, of sterilisable material, which may be sterilised after removal of the illuminating means, without causing problems in the sterilising step. Alternatively, the entire device may be made disposable. According to the present invention there is provided an endoscopic device including an examination illuminating light source for illuminating a body cavity, said endoscopic device comprising One aspect of the invention, in an exemplary embodiment, is directed to an endoscopic instrument provided with dilator members and to a medical examination light comprising a chemiluminescent light source is attached. The chemiluminescent light source comprises an hermetically sealed light transmitting tube with at least two compartments separated by a breakable wall, with a chemiluminescent component in each of the compartments. The chemiluminescent light source is attached to a portion of the endoscope by means of an adhesive backing on the light transmitting tube. Following examination, the chemiluminescent light source is readily removed from the endoscope. As indicated above, a speculum to which the medical examination light in attached is considered herein to be an endoscopic instrument. Another, more specific, aspect of the invention, in an exemplary embodiment, is directed to a vaginal speculum comprising cooperating upper and lower dilator blades operatively connected in a selectively adjustable manner and at least one rib like member on the surface of at least one of the dilator blades intermediate the dilator blades, having a channel adapted to receive and retain therein, in a releasable, snap fit, the medical examination light comprising a chemiluminescent light source having an hermetically sealed flexible light transmitting tube with at least two compartments separated by a breakable wall, with a chemiluminescent component in each of the compartments. The tube is adapted to be received and retained in a releasable, snap fit, in the channel in the rib like member and to direct its light intermediate the upper and lower dilator blades in their extended position. These and other objects of the invention will become more apparent from the hereinafter following commentary taken in conjunction with the following figures of drawings. Much of the detailed description which follows relates specifically to a vaginal speculum. Referring to the Figures of drawings wherein like numbers of reference designate like elements throughout, there is illustrated a speculum according to the invention. The instrument consists of a handle 2 connected to a lower dilator blade 4, and upper dilator blade 6 having a second handle 8. Handle 8 is operatively connected to handle 2 in a slidably adjustable manner by means of slot 1 in handle 8 which engages around pivot pin 12 on handle 2. The upper dilator blade of the speculum is provided with extending locking tab 14, by means of which the physician can hold in position the remote ends of the two dilator blades separated within the vaginal cavity as the blades are pivoted with respect to one another at pivot pin 12. A plurality of rib like members 22 are located on the interior surface of upper dilator blade 6 intermediate the two dilator blades and have a channel 24 therein adapted to receive and retain therein, in a releasable, snap fit, a medical examination light 26. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate two alternate channels which are capable of receiving and retaining, in a releasable, snap fit, medical examination light 26 therein. Medical examination light 26 produces light by chemiluminescent means and has an hermetically sealed, flexible light transmitting tub 28 with at least two compartments 3 and 32 separated by a breakable wall 34 with a chemiluminescent component in each compartment. In one compartment in the fluorescer component and in another is the activator component. Mixing of the components produces the chemiluminescent effect, as is well known. Tube 28 has a cross sectional shape adapted to be received and retained in channel 24 in a releasable, snap fitting engagement. Once in position and activated as described below, medical examination light 26 directs its light intermediate the two dilator blades in their extended position to illuminate the cavity for the examining physician. In the embodiment shown in Figures 12 15, only those structural features which differ from those described in Figures 1 5 are shown. Upper dilator blade 4 has a perimetric flange 42 along a majority of its lower periphery adapted to receive and retain a medical examination light 44 in a frictional, slip in fitting engagement adjacent the inner surface of upper dilator blade 4 and intermediate the two dilator blades in their extended position. Medical examination light 44 produces light by chemiluminescent means and has an hermetically sealed, flexible light transmitting bladder member 46 with at least two compartments 48 and 5 separated by a breakable well 52 with a chemiluminescent component in each compartment. Bladder member 46 has a shape conformable to the inner surface of upper dilator blade 4 so as to be received and retained in a frictional, slip fitting engagement thereto. More specifically, medical examination light 44 is held in position by having the lower perimetric boundary of its bladder member abut the perimetric flange of the upper dilator blade, thereby preventing the bladder member from moving downward. In use, the medical examination light will be installed by sliding it into the dilator blade from the rearward position of the dilator blade until it is held in position by the perimetric flange of the dilator blade. To remove the medical examination light, it is pulled toward the rear of the dilator blade once it is no longer needed. Figures 16 2 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the device described immediately above, wherein is added an aperture 8 in the extending portion of the dilator blade 82 adopted to permit pressure to be applied, as by a thumb or the like, to rupture the breakable wall 84 and activate the chemical reaction producing chemiluminescence. The embodiment illustrated in Figures 8 11 shows a partial view of an upper dilator blade 6 having the medical examination light removably secured thereto. The medical examination light 62 has an hermetically sealed flexible light transmitting bladder member 64 with at least two compartments 64 and 68 separated by a breakable wall 7 with a chemiluminescent component in each compartment. Light producing bladder member 64 is attached to the inner surface of a open ended elastomeric sleeve member 72 generally parallel to the longitudinal axis thereof. Sleeve 72 is generally light transmitting in the area of bladder 64 and is of sufficient size to encircle the extending portion of dilator blade 6 , receiving and retaining it in a removable, tight friction fit therein. To use the medical examination light described herein, the physician first activates the light producing bladder member, as described elsewhere, and then slips the elastomeric sleeve member over the extending portion of a dilator blade. The speculum is now ready for the physician s use. To discard the medical examination light at the conclusion of the examination, the physician need only slip the elastomeric sleeve off the dilator blade by pulling or pushing it toward the remote end of the dilator blade. In general, to activate the chemiluminescence of the light containing bladder member, pressure is applied to rupture the breakable wall separating the chemical components necessary to react in order to cause chemiluminescence. The chemiluminescent light source may be activated prior to its attachment to the speculum. This procedure may prove the easiest and preferred method of activating the chemiluminescent light source. Figure 4 illustrates a chemiluminescent light source attached to a speculum. Figure 5 illustrates the chemical components reacting to cause luminescence. In alternate embodiments, the rib members may have more than one channel to receive and retain therein, in a releasable snap fit, more than one chemiluminescent light source as illustrated in Figure 9. Yet another embodiment of the medical examination light is depicted in Figures 21 25. In this embodiment, the medical examination light 9 is provided with an adhesive backing 92, which permits its attachment to an endoscopic instrument endoscope or speculum 94 provided with dilator members. The adhesive backing is protected by a layer not shown which is peeled off the adhesive when attachment of the medical examination light to the endoscopic instrument is desired. As described earlier, medical examination light 9 produces light by chemiluminescent means and has an hermetically sealed, light transmitting tube 96 with at least two compartments 98 and 1 separated by a breakable wall 1 2 with a chemiluminescent component in each compartment. Tube 96 has a cross sectional shape adapted to by received the endoscopic device 94 by means of adhesive 92. As shown in Figures 22 and 25, the tube 96 is provided with a flange or rib 1 4 having a curvilinear shape substantially identical to that of the endoscopic instrument 94 to which it is attached. Activation to produce the chemiluminescent effect is accomplished by depressing plunger 1 8 against wall 1 2 until rupture thereof by point 11 of the plunger is achieved, as shown in Figure 24. The two chemiluminescent components in compartments 98 and 1 react to produce the desired effect. In operation, the physician would depress the plunger to rupture the wall, optionally shake the tube to speed the chemical reaction, and attach the tube to the endoscopic device by peeling off the adhesive protective layer and securing the lighted device to the endoscopic instrument by means of the adhesive. Hermetic sealing of the compartments 98 and 1 is conveniently achieved by providing one of the compartments with an end cap 1 6 and another of the compartments with the plunger 1 8. As shown in Figure 21, shaft 112 of the plunger 1 8 may be provided with an O ring seal 114, seated in a slot 116, to provide hermetic sealing of the compartment 1 and thus prevent leakage of the chemiluminescent liquid out of the tube 96. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 23, the shaft 112 of the plunger 1 8 may be provided with a bead 118, integrally formed as part of the plunger, to achieve the same result. Other means may also be suitably employed to provide hermetic sealing and to prevent leakage of the chemiluminescent liquid. Stop means may also be employed to insure retention of plunger 108 in tube 96. All portions of the medical examination light 9 tube 96, wall 1 2, end cap 1 6 and plunger 1 8 conveniently comprise a plastic material. Examples of such plastic materials include medical grade polystyrene and polypropylene. If polystyrene is employed, which is somewhat rigid, then the wall 1 2 would comprise a rigid web separating the compartments 98 and 1 . If a semirigid polypropylene is employed, then the web could have slits or a feather cut therein so as to allow fluid communication between the compartments. In this latter instance, the viscosity of the fluids prevents their intermingling, and hence chemical reaction, until the wall is penentrated by the plunger and the fluids permitted to mix. In yet another embodiment, at least one of the compartments 98 and 1 includes a frangible glass ampoule filled with the appropriate chemiluminescent component. Employing a conformable plastic as the material for the tube 96, then the tube may be squeezed, as between the fingers, to break the ampoule s and initiate the chemical reaction. If one of the compartments comprises the glass ampoule, the plunger 1 8 could be employed to alternatively break the ampoule. Otherwise, if each compartment comprises a glass ampoule, then the plunger could be eliminated altogether and an end cap used in its place.
