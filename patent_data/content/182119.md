# In line coil winder and process carried out thereon.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a coil winder in line and a process carried out thereon. The coil winder is of the type comprising at least two sets 2, 3 of spindles for coil support, rotating about parallel axes and mounted on two opposed surfaces of a bed 1 tilting by 180 , this latter rotating about a horizontal axis X which is trans versal to the axes of the spindles. Two motion trans missions are provided on the tilting bed to independently drive the spindles of a first set 2 and, respectively, the spindles of a second set 3 . While the coils supported by the first set of spindles are being wound, the spindles of the second set are in a waiting position for loading or unloading the coils. According to the invention, an inter mediate and or supplementary working stage is carried out on the coils mounted on the spindles of the second set, taking advantage of the waiting period. For this purpose, operating means are associated also to the front part of the coil winder and comprise first of all secondary motor means 17 positioned symmetrically to the main motor unit 13 controlling the winding of the coils on the spindles of the first set which act on the motion transmission driving the spindles of the second set.
