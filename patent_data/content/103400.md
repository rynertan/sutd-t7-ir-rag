# Process for making carbohydrazide.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for making carbohydrazide by react ing a di lower alkyl carbonate with hydrazine in two stages with an intermediate step of removing the corresponding lower alkanol formed as a co product in the first stage. The two reaction stages are carried out at relatively low temperatures i. e. below about 80 C .
