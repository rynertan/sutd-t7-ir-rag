# Microwave power combiner.

## Abstract
A microwave power combiner for combining the power output from a plurality of cooperating microwave avalanche diodes 36 , such as those diodes commonly termed IMPATT diodes, having input terminals 141 149 , said microwave power combiner comprising a balancing network including a plurality of resistors 181 189 coupling the diode input terminals 141 149 to a common floating node 121 124 the optional inclusion of RF lossy bypass capacitors to ground several points of the common floating node 121 124 suppresses bias circuit oscillations.
