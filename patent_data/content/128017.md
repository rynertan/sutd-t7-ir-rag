# Oven for heating can ends.

## Abstract
An oven for heating can ends comprising a generally elongate heating chamber having walls which closely sur round a conveyor for conveying the can ends through the chamber, a source of infra red heat arranged in the upper region of said chamber and having a parabolic reflector by means of which radiant heat is directed downwardly onto a generally narrow band which corresponds in width to the width of the region of the can end to which sealant and or repair lacquer has been applied, said conveyor being con structed from a plurality of interconnected slat like elements having upturned edges the spacing between the upturned edges being selected so that the edges engage narrow por tions of the curled edge of the can end whereby the can end is supported with the surface to which sealant or lining com pound has been applied directed downwardly so that the heat source principally heats the upwardly directed surface of the can ends, a cooling chamber of similar dimensions to said heating chamber following said heating chamber, said cool ing chamber including a cooling air outlet which directs a stream of cool air onto a central region of each can end as it is conveyed through said cooling region.
