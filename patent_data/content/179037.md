# Nuclear binding assay for steroid receptor functionality in cancerous cells.

## Abstract
A method for rapidly determining the presence of functional cellular steroid receptors by assaying a tissue sample for nuclear steroid binding is disclosed which comprises treating the tissue with collagenase, incubating the isolated cells with a labelled steroid capable of complex ing said receptors and measuring the bound radioactivity and the DNA of the isolated cellular nuclei.
