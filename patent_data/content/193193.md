# WAVEGUIDE TYPE OPTICAL SENSOR

## Abstract
A plurality of modulating elements are provided on a substrate to modulate the intensity of input light in depend ence upon an applied physical quantity. Intensity modulated output optical signals from these plural modulating elements propagate in parallel along the substrate. These parallel optical signals are successively diffracted by a pulsed surface acoustic wave, and the diffracted light is then focused. Since parallel optical signals from a plurality of modulating elements can thus be converted into a serial optical signal, the signal can be transmitted by a single optical fiber.
