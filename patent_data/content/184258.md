## Description
Piperidinylalkyl quinazoline derivatives having potent serotonin antagonistic properties have been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,335,127. The compounds of the present invention differ from the hereinabove mentioned prior art compounds by their substitution on the quinazoline moiety and by their increased serotonin antagonistic properties. The present invention is concerned with quinazoline derivatives which are structurally represented by the formula and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, wherein C NOH and C N NH₂ In the foregoing definitions the term halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo C₁ ₆ alkyl is meant to include straight and branched saturated hydrocarbon radicals, having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, 1 methylethyl, 1,1 dimethylethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl C₁ ₁₀ alkyl is meant to include C₁ ₆ alkyl radicals, as defined hereinabove, and the higher homologs thereof having from 7 to 10 carbon atoms and C₁ C₆ alkanediyl is meant to include bivalent straight or branch chained alkanediyl radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferred compounds within the scope of formula I are those wherein R¹ is amino, acetylamino or azido, R² is hydrogen, R is hydrogen and Q is CO Ar. Particularly preferred compounds within the scope of formula I are those wherein R, R¹ and R² are described for the preferred compounds, and wherein Q is CO Ar, wherein Ar is halophenyl. The most preferred compound within the scope of formula I is 7 azido 3 2 4 4 fluorobenzoyl 1 piperidinyl ethyl 2,4 The compounds of formula I can generally be prepared by reacting an appropriate reactive ester of formula II with a piperidine of formula III . In II and III R¹, R², Y¹, Y², Alk, R and Q are as previously defined and W is a reactive ester residue such as, for example, halo, e.g. chloro, bromo or iodo, or a sulfonyloxy radical such as methylsulfonyloxy, 4 methylphenylsulfonyloxy. The above mentioned reactions are conveniently conducted in an inert organic solvent such as, for example, an aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g., benzene, methylbenzene, dimethylbenzene a lower alkanol, e.g., methanol, ethanol, 1 butanol a ketone, e.g., 2 propanone, 4 methyl 2 pentanone an ether, e.g., 1,4 dioxane, 1,1 oxybisethane, tetrahydrofuran In order to simplify the structural representation of the compounds of formula I and of certain intermediates thereof the radical of formula will hereinafter be represented by the symbol D. The compounds of formula I may also be prepared by cyclizing an intermediate of formula IV with an amine of formula V . In IV R⁶ and R may be isolated before the start of the cyclization reaction. Additionally, the compounds of formula I may be prepared by cyclizing an isocyanate or isothiocyanate of formula VII with an amine of formula V . Said cyclization reactions are conveniently conducted by heating the reactants together, optionally in a suitable reaction inert solvent having a relatively high boiling point such as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. petroleumether, dimethylbenzene, an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, water. The presence of a suitable base, e.g. an alkalimetal or earth alkaline metal hydroxide, such as potassium hydroxide, may enhance the rate of the reaction. The compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is amino, said compounds being represented by the formula I a , may also be derived from the corresponding nitro substituted quinazolines of formula VIII following art known nitro to amine reduction procedures. A suitable nitro to amine reducing procedure is, for example, catalytic hydrogenation in a relatively polar solvent such as, for example, an alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol, in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, e.g. platinum on charcoal. In some cases it may be useful to add an appropriate catalyst poison, e.g. thiophene. The compounds of formula I may also be converted into each other following art known functional group transformation procedures. For example, the compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is amino may be converted into compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is C₁ ₆ alkylcarbonylamino by reacting the former compounds with a suitable acylating agent, e.g. an acylhalide or an acid anhydride the compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is an amino group may be converted into compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is an azido group by converting the amino group into a diazonium group with nitrous acid or an appropriate alkalimetal or earth alkaline metal thereof and subsequently converting the said diazonium group into an azide group with sodium azide or any other suitable alkalimetal or earth alkaline metal azide the compounds of formula I wherein R² is hydrogen may be converted into compounds of formula I wherein R² is halo following art known procedures for halogenating aromatic rings compounds of formula I wherein Q is CO Ar may be converted into compounds of formula I wherein Q is CHOH Ar following art known carbonyl to alcohol reducing procedures, e.g. by using sodiumborohydride as reductans and compounds of formula I wherein X in X Ar is C O C₁ ₆ alkyl ₂ or may be converted into compounds of formula I wherein Q is CO Ar by reacting the former with a suitable acid. The intermediates and starting materials in the foregoing preparations may be prepared according to art known methodologies for preparing said or similar chemical compounds, as described, for example in US Patent No. 4,335,127. The compounds of formula I have basic properties and, consequently, they may be converted to their therapeutically active non toxic acid addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids, such as hydrohalic acid, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or organic acids, such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, 2 hydroxy propanoic, 2 oxopropanoic, ethanedioic, propanedioic, butanedioic, Z 2 butenedioic, E 2 butenedioic, 2 hydroxybutanedioic, 2,3 dihydroxybutanedioic, 2 hydroxy 1,2,3 propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, 4 methylbenzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, benzoic, 2 hydroxybenzoic, 3 phenyl 2 propenoic, α hydroxybenzeneacetic, 4 amino 2 hydroxybenzoic acid. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form. The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically active acid addition salts have useful pharmacological properties. They are very potent serotonin antagonists and as such they can be used in the treatment of a variety of diseases in which serotonin release is of predominant importance. Caudal arteries from fasted male rats 210 235 g were used in the test. Two helical strips having a length of 5 6 cm and a width of 2 mm were obtained from each artery and mounted vertically in a 100 ml organ bath containing an oxygenated Krebs Henseleit solution. Submaximal contractions of the arterial strips were produced by adding single doses of serotonin 40 ng ml to the organ bath for 2 minutes with each time an interval of 10 minutes. The amplitude of the contraction is measured before and 5 minutes after adding the drug. After washing out, the agonist was added again three times in order to see whether the contraction is restored and normalized. Compound 48 80 a mixture of oligomers obtained by condensation of 4 methoxy Male rats of a Wistar inbred strain, weighing 220 250 g, were starved overnight, water being available ad libitum. The test compounds were administered orally as a solution or as a suspension in aqueous medium. A control rat and a blank rat receive the test compound. One hour later 5 4 diphenylmethyl 1 piperazinyl methyl 1 methyl 1H benzimidazole 2 methanol is administered subcutaneously to all rats at the dose of 2.5 mg kg. Two hours after the oral administration of the test compound the compound 48 80 freshly dissolved in water at a concentration of 0.25 mg ml was injected intravenously into all rats dose 1 mg kg except the blank rats. Five minutes after the injection the intensity of purple blue coloration cyanosis of the extremities was scored as 0 absent , moderate or intense . Four hours after the intravenous injection of compound 48 80 the rats were decapitated and the stomachs were removed. Subsequently the stomachs were inspected for distension and contents blood, fluid, food and thoroughly rinsed. The macroscopic lesions were scored from 0 to , 0 corresponding to complete absence of visible lesions and the highest score corresponding to reddish rough patches covering more than half the glandular area. The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are selective serotonin S₂ antagonists which bind with high affinity to S₂ or 5 HT₂ receptors, directly antagonize serotonin induced platelet activation and blood vessel contraction and prevent the functional consequences of serotonergic overstimulation such as vascular congestion and subsequent organ deficiency e.g. gastric lesions . Consequently the compounds of the present invention can be used in the treatment of a broad spectrum of diseases according to the vascular bed in which excessive serotonin release occurs, primarily in hypertension and carcinoid syndrome but also in Raynaud s disease, gastrointestinal ulcus , scleroderma, hemorroids, irritable bowel syndrom and the like diseases whenever platelet activation with a thrombotic tendency or an excessive serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells is present. In view of their useful selective serotonin S₂ antagonistic properties, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare the pharmaceutical composition of this invention, an effective serotonin antagonistic amount of the particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents may be employed. Acid addition salts of I , due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets including scored or coated tablets , capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and segregated multiples thereof. The following formulations exemplify typical serotonin antagonistic pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form suitable for systemic administration to animal and human subjects in accordance with the present invention.
