# Degreasing apparatus.

## Abstract
Degreasing apparatus utilizes hot water under pres sure from a sink tap 23 to inject a degreasing solution directly into a blocked U trap 10 or downstream sewerage system 19 . The degreasing apparatus consists of a small pipe elbow 11 permanently affixed at one end 12 to the output nozzle 13 of a liquid dispenser 14 and provided at the other end 15 with a female coupling nut 16 for attach ing the apparatus to standard U traps. To use the apparatus, the input 22 of the liquid dispenser 14 is coupled by a conventional high pressure hose 25 to the hot water tap 23 of the blocked sink. The output end 15 of the degreas ing apparatus is coupled to the input 17 of the U trap 10 after the trap is uncoupled from the drain pipe 18 of the sink. After tightening the coupling nuts of the U trap, the degreasing apparatus permits the injection of a degreasing solution 27 from the liquid dispenser container at tap pressure into a blocked U trap or downstream sewerage system.
