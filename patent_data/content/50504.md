# Mechanism for de repression control.

## Abstract
Certain spedified growth stimulators, e.g. gibberellins, are applied to crop plants in order to counteract the apical dominance suppressing effect of a plant growth regulator such as chlorocholine chloride. The growth stimulator is preferably applied after the plant growth regulator.

## Description
bIECRANISM FOR we REPRESSION CONTROL The use of growth regulators, especially Chlormequat Chlorocholine chloride or 2 chloroethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride , in combination with biochemical adjutants in a variety of crops has been described in my prior PCT Application No.GB 79 00050 WO 79 00838 and corresponding U.K. Application No.7918957 2050452 and its use without such adjuvants on a range of broad leaf crops in U.K. Patent Application No. 8031575. The use of coating formulations with such growth regulators, including their application in the autumn to cereal crops, has been described in my prior PCT Application No. GB 80 00116 WO 81 00187 and corresponding U.K. Application No. 8022640 2057265 . One aim of such treatments is to suppress apical dominance.Apical dominance means the over development of one part cf 2 plant against another. It is the mechanism by waiesl, in a cereal plant, one shoot suppresses the development of those shoots that develop after it and the development of grains within the ear may con sequently be aborted or reduced. Similarly in niany broau iea plants the mechanism ensures the development of main shoots at the expense of others to such an extent that a reduction in yield potential is caused. Thus, by suppressing apical dominance, an increase in yield may be obtained.For this purpose the chlormequat as a 460 g l solution is preferably applied In amounts from 1 fluid ounce to 10 pints per acre, i.e. from 70 my to 14 litres per hectare, and it may be applied in conventional manner by spraying in a solution diluted with 100 to 5000 times its volume of water. Other additives such as surfactants may also be included and the time of application is preferably from two weeks after the first appearance of the seedlings until two weeks before flowering. In pod bearing crops the increase in yield results from increase in the number of pods per plant, increase in the size of pods and of the number and size of seeds that they can contain.Increase in fresh weight of root and sugar content are obtained in the case of sugar beet. However, the suppression of apical dominance may mean that a point is reached at which the pattern of apical dominance may no longer be readily initiated by a cereal plant or by a broad leaf plant. Thus, where the abovementioned formulations for the suppression of apical dominance have been used to control this aspect of plant behaviour until such a time as the plant can no longer reinstitute it, it can be beneficial to treat the plant with formulations containing those hormones and other compounds listed below that are capable of inducing the development and growth that are normally produced by the plant during the establishment of apical dominance or which can be wholly or partly substituted for an external stimulus such as cold weather or day length. The present invention provides a method of improving the yield of crop plants treated with a growth regulator in such an amount that apical dominance is suppressed, comprising further treating the plants with a stimulator composition containing one or more of the following ingredients a gibberellin of naturally occurring or synthetic type l naphthyl methyl carbamate, which is also known as Carbaryl or Sevin 4 chlorophenoxy acetic acid, which is also known as 4 CPA or Sure Set 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which is also knows as 2, D or by many trade names Thdol 3 yl acetic acid, which is also known as Indole 3 acetic acid, IAA, Auxin or Beteroauxin 4 indol 3 yl hutyric acid, which is also known as Indole 3 butyric acid, IBA, Seradi2 , IIormodin and others l naphthylacetic acid, which is also known as o naphthaleneacetic acid, NAA, Planofix1, Tre hold , Anastop1 and others 2 l naphthyl acetamide, which is also known as NAAm or Amidthin 2 naphthJrloxyacetic acid, which is also known as ss naphthoxyacetic acid, 2 NOA, BNOA, NOXB, Betapal or Fulset 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which is also known as 2,4,5 T and by many trade names 2 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxy propionic acid, which is also known as 2,4,5 TP, Fenoprop, Silvex or Nu set 6 benzylaminopurine, which is also known as BAP, BA, Accel or 6 benzyladenine 6 benzyladenosine, which is also known asN,N diphenylurea, which is also known as DPU 6 benzylamino 9 2 tetrahydropyranyl 9 H purine, which is also known as PBA catechol tricontanol phlordizin and phloretic acid.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a crop plant has been previously treated with.an apical dominance suppressing growth regulatory formulation, such as those described in the PCT and U.K. Applications mentioned above and in U.K. Application No. 8015580 2052260 , is treated with such a hormone formulation. The apical dominance suppressing agent used in the growthregulating composition may be one or more of Piperidinium l,l dimethyl chloride, which is also known asMepiquat chloride 2 chloroethyl tris 2 methoxyethoxy silane, which is also known as Alsol or CGA 15281 5 chloro 3 methyl 4 nitro lH pyrazole, which is also known as CMNP or Release 3 2 3,5 dimethyl 2 oxycyclohexyl 2 hydroxyethyl glutarimide, which is also known as Cycloheximide, CHI, Actidione or Actiaid Glyoxal dioxime, which is also known as Glyoxime or Pik off 2 chloroethylphosphonic acid, which is also known as Sthephon, CEPA, Ethrel , Cepha , Florel , Bromeflor and others 2 chloro 9 hydroxyfluorene 9 carboxylic acid methyl ester, which is also known as Chlorflurecol, Chlorflurenol, Morphactin or Maintain N m tolylphthalamic acid, which is also known as MTPA, tDurasett or Tomaset 2,3,5 triiodobenzoic acid, which is also known as TUBA, tPloral tone or Regim 8 3 i sopropyl 2 methyl 4 piperidino carbonylo phenyl trimethylammonium chloride, which is also known as AMO 1618, Carvadan or ACPC alpha cyclopropyl 4 methoxy alpha pyridimin 5 yl benzyl alcohol, which is also known as Ancymidol, EL 531, Quel , A Rest , or Reducymol 2 chloroethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, which is also known as Chlormequat, Chlorocholine chloride, CCC, iCycocel or Tur 2,4 dichlorobenzyl tributyl phosphonium chloride, which is also known as Chlorphonium chloride , CBBP or Phosphon N dimethylaminosuccinamic acid, which is also known as Daminozide,B.995, B.9, DIMAS, SM H, Alar , y1ar , B Nine or Aminosol 2,3 4,6 di o isopropylidene a L xylo 2 hexulo furanosonic acid, which is also known as Dikegulac Na , Atrinal or Cutlass . The application rate of the hormone would be at rates from 100 milligrams to 500 grams per acre 0.25 to 1250 g per hectare applied in from 4 pints per acre 5.5 litres per bectare using an ultra low volume sprayer or up to 1,000 gallons per acre about 11,000 litres per hectare using conventional spraying equipment.The timing of application to a cereal crop could be before or after the initiation of the seed primordia while in a broad leaf crop it could be from some 2 weeks after germination up to 50 flowering. Examples of crops that may be treated are barley, wheat, rice, oats, maize, sorghum, óilseed rape, peas, beans, soya, herbage grasses, potatoes, sugar beet and fruit bearing trees and bushes. The description above indicates that it is preferred to apply the stimulator i.e. the composition containing the hormone and the apical dominance suppressing agent after the growth regulator, but this order can be reversed if circumstances require or the stimulator and growth regulator can be applied simultaneously.As another possibility, three applications two of one and one of the other can be made in the order growth regulator stimulator growth regulator or stimulator growth regulator stimulator. The interval between application of the growth regulator and application of the stimulator will normally be from ten days to three months in the case of a crop that is harvested without overwintering and from ten days to seven months in the case of a crop that is planted in autumn and harvested the following spring. Application, which will normally be by spraying, is carried out where ground conditions permit, and the suitable time for application varies from crop to crop. The effect of applying a composition containing gibberellic acid to a crop that had previously been treated with a growth regulator is shown in the following table. Hele Stone, Barleyquat, Halloween, Bettaquat and Podquat are all trade marks for growthregulating compositions that are commercially available in theUnited Kingdom from Mandops Agrochemical Specialists Ltd.
