## Description
A shared line transmitter This invention relates generally to distributed computerized controllers of machine process in a host machine and particularly toInput Output channel controllers interfacing with a shared line. In the past, controllers for a machine were either relatively very centralized as to function or decentralized as to a hardwired master controller and assorted hard wired slave controllers. The problem in the first case is that relatively many control cables must be run over relatively long distances thereby causing spatial dislocations and noise inducements. The decentralized case has many of the problems of the centralized case but relatively to a lesser degree. In addition, the limited proqrammability in either the centralized or decentralized cases limits the architectural flexibility as to functions. A shared line transmitter module operative to accept as a message one or more bytes of data in parallel from an input output channel for predetermined buffering and phase encoding to a shared line except upon receipt of signal indicating that a collision of messages was detected on the shared line.

Referring to Figures 1 through 55C by the character of reference, there is illustrated an apparatus for carrying out the objects of the invention. The shared line receiver SLR 35 and the shared line transmitter SLT 40 are macros that are used for serial communications on a line 70 which is shared by any othe controllers or subcontrollers or control element 105 1 having a shared communication controller 5 such as diagrammed in Fig. 3. The SLR 35 is a receiver device and a receiver controller. So too, the SLT 40 is an integrated device and controller. The microprocessor control for theSLT 40 and SLR 35 from microprocessor 10 and is exerted through I O channels.The SLT Controller 105 1 operates through the microcomputer 10 having memory 15 which generates signals through an external bus 25, a bus processor 60, a SSB bus 55 and finally through the IOCT and IOCR input output channels 42 and 37 to the SLT and SLR 40 and 35 respectively.It will be appreciated that the SLT and SLR 408 35, having output channels on buses 80 and 65 are operative to interface with the shared line 70 through transceiver 90. It will be further appreciated that the SCC 5 is clocked through clock module 85 on to SSB 55 . To simplify the control problem and permit receiving and transmitting, each macro SLT40 and SLR35 has an I O channel 42 and 37 respectively. The phase encoding and decoding of messages as explained infra is done using all digital techniques. The SLR 35 monitors the shared line 70 performing three essential functions first, if it detects a carrier on the line, it notifies its associate SLT 40, causing it to defer transmitting until the line 70 is quiet secondly, if it detects a collision on the line 70, meaning that another station or subcontroller 105 1 is also attempting to transmit it notifies its associated SLT 40, which aborts its own transmission and jams the line 70 long enough to be certain that all SLR s 35 on the line 70 have detected the condition and thirdly, if it matches the destination address at the head of an incoming message to its own identification address as explained infra, or if it recognizes the address designed for broadcast to all receivers 35, or if it is in the promiscuous mode instructed to receive all messages , it accepts the bit serial message, performs a cyclic redundancy check run CRC converts the message to byte parallel data, and passes the data via its associated IOCR 35 to Memory 15 having RAM where it is available to the processor or microcomputer 10. The features of the SLR SLT 35 and 40 includes use of SLR SLT pairs 35, 40 permitting packets of digital data to be communicated among distributed processors stations 105 1 even in the presence of considerable electrical noise. This communication enables control elements 105 1 in various parts of the machine or system to supervise a local function while maintain coordination with other control elements 105 1. Another feature is that the communication medium 70 is passive minimizing the possibility of failure of the medium itself. Communication over a passive medium 70, such as a twisted pair of wires or a single coaxial cable greatly reduces the number of lines needed, compared to conventional parallel transmission of digital signals. Yet another feature is that the transmission method is phased coding or Manchester coding.It has the advantage of being able to transmit between stations with independent clock generators 85 without using an additional line for a clock. Another feature is that each SLR SLT station 35 , 40 is independent of all other stations, there is no central control that might become a bottleneck, so far as access to the shared line 70 isconcerned.The stations 105 1 themselves must arbitrate contention or access to the line 70. If two or more stations 105 1 attempt access at the same time, both back off for randomly determined periods of t me, so that their next access tries will take ac at different tinge another fea ure is that since the stations 105 1 having SLR SLT 35 40 are ependent of each other, failure f one station 05 1 of not affect zither stations 105 i or the shared line 70.The rest of the system continues without t he failed unit, Yet another feature is that a r cular r r SLT 35140 can communicate to any other station 105 1 on the shared lines 70 by using its unique identification address or it an broa ro. a t to all stations 105 1 by using a common address designated for this purpose. Another feature is that each receiver 35 ignores co munications not addressed or proadcast to it, except that, in the prolmiscuoJ mode, a receiver ,f can intercept all messages. Thus, a designated receiver 35 can be employed to provide a record of all activity on the shared line 70 for u in troubleshooting. Yet another feature is that instrumentation of the shared line receivers 35 transmitter 40 and the controllers 5 in the form of macros 105 1 on one chip reduces cost to the level that permits packet communications over a shared line 70 to be economical in small systems. In many machine control systems half a dozen or so processor stations 105 1, will be sufficient, but further expansion is possible. Particularly, the 8 bit destination address permits up to 254 stations on a single line 70. The volume of messages may limit the number of stations 105 1 in some other locations to be less than this. In regards to basic principles for the control of the shared line 70, the shared line 70 is a medium for communicating among the number of control elements 105 1, each containing a microcomputer 10. The shared line 70 itself may be a twisted pair although other media, such as a single coaxial cable can also be employed. The shared line 70 is accessed by the shared line receiver 35 and a shared line transmitter 40 in each control element 105 1. The message is a bit serial digital data packet, preceded by a start bit, destination address, and source address. Control of access to the shared line 70 rests with each receiving and transmitting station 35 40. A station 105 1 with a message ready to transmit defers to a transmission already in progressThe station 105 1 mayinitiate a transmission only when the line is clear. If two stations 105 1 have messages ready and have been waiting for a transmission to end, each waits a further random period of time before attempting to begin transmission. The random waiting period is intended to minimize interference of one transmission with another This interference is called a collision. If a collision is detected, the detecting station 105 1 aborts its own transmission and jams the line The purpose of jamming is to ensure that all stations 105 1 recognize a collision and abort their own transmission, thus putting all stations 105 1 in the back off state. The first requisite for obtaining an independent backoff is a means for enabling each station to create a period of random length. In the SLT 40 this means is a free running counter 755 described infra which generates simulated or psuedo random numbers. However, the random numbers are distributed about a mean so that the average length of the back off period is a known quantity. When the shared line 70 is engaged infrequently, as might be the case in a small system, a transmitter 40 has no difficulty in getting access to it.As the number of stations 105 1 or the volume of messages increases a transmitter 40 has to defer more often to existing messages. Also, the frequency of collisions between messages tend to rise.To make allowance for this increase, it is desirable to increase the average length of the backoff periods This is accomplished by counting the number of collisions experienced by a receiver 35 and increasing the number of bits of random number tranferred to a countdown counter 1765 described infra. The time out of this counter 1765 represents the backoff period. As each additional bit of the random number is loaded in to the countdown counter 1765 the average size of the number to be counted down doubles. As a backoff period doubles on an average with each additional collision counted, the probabilty of another collision diminishes. However, after counting eight collisions, a transmitter 40 jams the line 70, aborts further attempts to transmit, and notifies its processor 10. In regards to addressing, the first byte of each message is the destination address and the second byte, the source of the address. A packet placed on the shared line 70 propagates to all receivers 35, but is accepted only under the following conditions first, destination address matches the receivers 35 identification address, or secondly, the designated address is zero, the address designated by convention for broadcast messages to all receivers 35 or thirdly, the receiver 35 is to receive all messages. In regards to carrier detection, for one station 105 1 to be able to defer to another, it must be able to detect the presence of a message on a shared line 70. In the transmission method employed, phase encoding, there is at least one transition from one logic level to another in each bit period. The fact that the message is present therefore, can be detected every bit period by the occurrence of the transmission carrier. In a system with carrier detection, collisions are minimized, because a transmitter 40 defers accessing the line when it is in use. Thus collisicns can occur only when several stations 105 1 are waiting for the line to become available and begin transmitting at about the same time when it does.In regards to collision detection, the receivers 35 of the stations 105 1 are equipped to detect the occurrence of two or more transitions in a bit period,indicating that two or more transmitters 40 are transmitting If the random backoff periods of two or more stations 105 1 time out close to each other and several transmissions are initiated at almost the same time, the station 105 1 that is the first to detect the collision will abort its own transmission and reschedule it after doubling the backoff period. Meantime, it jams shared line 70 by putting out a high level for two bit periods, a time sufficient to ensure that all stations 105 1 have become aware of the interference condition. Once a transmission has been on the line 70 long enough to reach all stations 105 1, they defer to it and it runs to termination, barring noise which simulates a collision. In regards to error detection, even when the first station 105 1 does not detect interference with its transmission, there is still some low probability of error in the received message. For this reason the transmitting station 105 1 has a cyclic redundancy check sum and the receiving station 105 1 verifies the sum. In addition, protocol at the software level may contain such error detection and correction procedure . For example, on being informed of a CRC error, the processor may then may refuse to acknowledge receipt of the message, forcing the transmittor 40 to repeat it. In regards to the basic structure of the SCC Subcontroller 105 1 having the SCC 5 , the shared line receiver 35 monitors the line 70, preventing the shared line transmittor 40 from transmitting when message bits are on the line 70. When a message is addressed to the particular receiver 35 it accepts the message, converts it to parallel bytes and transfers it to the input output controller 42 37 with which it is working. Data bound for the shared line 70are obtained in byte form from the RAM in the Memory 15 and is provided to the shared line transmitter 40, still in parallel, from the input output controller 42 microcoded for working with a SLT 40.Basically, the SLT 40 converts parallel bytes to serial bits and places them on the shared line 70 in the phase encoded format In regards to phase encoding, messages on the shared line 70 are phase encoded in a technique similar to that used in disk recording.The intelligence is contained in the transition from one logic level to the other a down transition is a zerojand an up transition a 1. As shown in Fig. 4, transitions occur approximately in the middle of the bit period. Moreover, to get the signal at a proper level for the next bit transition, a bit cell transition may take place near the bit period boundary as in the bit cell transition between data bits zero and zero or 1 and 1. Phase encoding is advantageous in a distributed system where each station 105 1 is running on its own clock module 85, because the method accommodates broad tolerance variations between the periods of the separate clocks. The present method of synchronization in relation to the start bit transition makes a separate strobe line unnecessary. In regards to message format, a message follows a period of no carrier on the shared line 70. It consists of a single start bit, followed by the destination address byte, source address byte, and data bytes as shown in Fig. 5 . The message is concluded by two CRC bytes, followed by no carrier, indicating the message is over and the line 70 is available for use. In regards to phase decoding, as shown in Fig. 6, the phase decoder interprets the contents of the share line in accordance with the following considerations first, a period of 13 or more sample clocks at the low levels interpreted as no carrier or end of message secondly, the start bit, which is a transition from the low level to the high level, is identified as the first bit transition, and sample clocks are categorized beginning at this transition, in the process of decoding the rest of the message thirdly, in a series of bit cells having a nominal timing there are 8 sample clocks in a full bit cell and 4 sample clocks for sample in a half bit cell, and therefore the line would normally be low either four or eight sample clocks and would normally be high either four or eight sample clocks.However, to allow for clock tolerance differences between the transmitter 40 and the receiver 35 , a half bit cell of three to five sample clocks,and a full bit cell of six to ten bit sample clocks are considered acceptable fourthly, on this basis the occurrence of a low or high level for less than twelve consecutive sample clocks periods is decoded as a collision fifthly, a full bit cell that falls between the bit cell transition is decoded as a collision and sixthly, a high level of thirteen or more sample clock periods is decoded as a jam. In regards to the shared line receiver 35, a shared line receiver 35 accepts phase encoded bits serially from the shared line 70 through the phase decoder 1435 and data sync 1440 and passes them down through a series of shift registers 1430 1 through 3 as shown in block diagram of Fig. 2, to the input buffer 1445, which is available for transfer in parallel to the FIFO buffer not shown of the IOCR 37 ofFig. 3. Fig. 7 is operative to give a functional flow of the shared line receiver 35 operation. In regards to the phase decoder 1435, the phase decoder 35 converts the phase transition into a series of logic signals which can be analyzed to recognize message start, carrier, collision detect, and data. The start logic 1450 recognizes the zero to one transition of the start bit and informs the program logic array PLA 1455 which serves as the central controller for the SLR macro 35. Carrier detector 1460 recognizes the presence of a carrier on the shared line 70 and informs the SLT 40 and the PLA 1455. Collision detector 1465 recognizes the presence of more than one transmission on the line 70 and informs theSLT 40 and PLA 1455. In regards to the address recognition 1470, the decoded data is fed serially to shift register one 1430 1 and the CRC logic 1475The first byte of the message, which contains the destination addresses available in the first register 1430 1 , is transferred to the address recognition 1470 and compared in a compare logic 1485 and the SLR s 35 identification address which is contained in the identification register 1480. The identification address is obtained via the data bus 400 from the IOCR 37. If the addresses match, the PLA 1455 is informed and the control logic 1480 is set to receive the entire message. Similarily, if the destination address is zero, broadcast mode , or the promiscuous mode is set, the PLA logic 1455 arranges to receive the entire message.If the addresses fails to match, the message is not passed through the IOCR 37, so as to avoid occupying the stations 105 1 memory 15 and processor 10 unnecessarily. In regards to the shift register 1430 1 to 1430 3, after address match, the dataareshifted serially from shift register 1 14301 into shift register 2 1430 2 and then into shift register 3 1430 3 .Three registers 1430 1 through 1430 3 are needed so that CRC bits contained in the final two bytes of the message will not be passed to theIOCR 37. At the time that line 70 goes quiet, indicating the end of the message, the two CRC bytes are in shift register one 1430 1 and shift register 2 1430 2 , while the final byte of the message as such is in shift register three 1430 3 . In regards to the cyclic redundancy check CRC checker, 1475, the CRC checker 1475 processes all the bits in the incoming message. If no error is detected, it informs the PLA 1455. If an error is detected, a PLA output sets the CRC status bit . The CRC checker 1475 detects errors in accordance with the polynominal X16 plus X15 plus x2 plus 1. In regards to the input buffer IB 1445, when the input buffer 1445 is full and the IOC FIFO buffer not as shown of the IOCR 37 of Fig 3 is not full, the byte in the input buffer for 1445 is written to theFIFO buffer under the direction of F,FO interface control 1495. Each byte transferred is identified by a two bit tag, as shown in Fig. 8. The tags indicate whether a byte is the first one of a message valid start , data within the message valid data or the last byte of data end stored in the two bit tag register 14459. of the input buffer 1445. In regards to status, following the last byte of the message the status of the message is transferred to theFIFO buffer of the IO CR 37, from a status register to be described infra in the SLR35. The accompanying tag indicates status. The status byte shown in Fig. 8 reports the following conditions VE indicates valid end, UE indicates unusual end, ME indicates message end, CRC indicates CRC error, COL indicates Collision, and DL indicates data late. Valid end signifies that CRC error, Collision, and Data Late did not Occur . Unusual end signifies that one or more of these conditions did occur. Message end is the end tag on a message. It indicates that the last CCB of a chain was completed. ME equals zero, 1ndicating that the message was aborted. In regards to the mode in register 1500, the mode register obtains two mode bits via the data bus 400 on the IOCR 37. One is half speed mode, applied to the timing generatorl405, the other is a promiscuous mode PM , applied to the address compare logic 1485. In regards to the IOCR control bus decode 1510, a number of signals from the IOCR 37,coliectively called the control bus 485, are decoded by a PLA on the SLR 35 to provide the sanle which perfo, ms the following function first, load the identification register 4 0 secondly, set and clear the macro reset logic 1510 thirdly, set and clear the macro ON logic 1515 fourthly, load and reset the mode register 1500. In regards to the shared line transmitter 40, the shared line transmitter obtains byte parallel data from the IOCT 42, sends it through the output buffer OB 1525 to be loaded into one of the three registers 1520 1 to 3 shown in Fig. 1, shifts the byte to serial form, and phase encodes it in a phase encoder 1530 for the shared line 70. Fig. 9 is operative to give a functional view of the shared line transmitter 40 operation. In regards to output buffer OB 1525, when the output buffer 1525 is empty and the FIFO buffer not shown of the 1OCT t2 is not empty, the byte on top of theFlFO buffer is transferred into the output buffer 1525 under the direction of theFIFO interface control logic 1535. Each byte transferred is identified by two bit tag of the tag register 1525 A of the OB 1525 as shown in Fig. 10. Tags indicates whether a byte is first one of a message valid start , data within the message valid data , or the last byte valid end . In regards to the registers 1520 1 to 3, when a shift registerSR3 1520 3 is available, the byte is transferred directly from the output buffer OB 1525 to it. Registers SR1 and SR2 1520 1 and 2 are used when the shift register 1520 3 is already occupied, for providing a small buffer within the macro 40, In regards to the CRC generator 40, the CRC generator 1540 processes all bits in the outgoing message in accordance with the polynonial X16 plus X15 plus X2 plus 1. At the conclusion of the message, it appends two CRC check bytes to it. In regards to the phase encoder 1530, it converts the serial logic bits from the shift register 1520 3 and two bytes from the CRC generator 1540 to phase encoded forms for the shared line 70. It places a start bit in front of the message. After the CRC byte, it permits the line 70 to go to the low level, indicating the end of the message. During a transmission, if the SLR 35 detects a collison, the phase encoder 1530 aborts its transmission and jams the line 70. In regards to the backoff algorithm 1545, in the event of a collison, the back off algorithm 1545 generates a psuedo random number indicating a period of time that the SLT 40 is to wait before attempting to retransmit its message. In the macro 40, the backoff algorithm 1545 is implemented in hardware which consists essentially of a collision counter 1780,a free running couner 1755 , a countdown counter 1765 and a count down clock 1770 all described infra and as shown in Fig. 26A.The collision counter 1780 counts the number of collisions up to eight in the embodiment. The free running counter 1755 generates as described infra, a suitable psuedo random number. Afer one collision, the freerunning counter 1755 transfers one bit which may be randomly either zero or one to the countdown counter 1765. The counter 1765 counts down, measuring the backoff period. After two collisions, the freerunning counter 1755 transfers two bits to the countdown counter 1765 thus doubling the average size or word length of the number transferred in doubling the countdown period. The actual countdown of the two bits remains random and so on up to eight bits or the capacity of the count as described. The count down clock 1770 clocks the supra operation. In regards to the status register 1550, after termination of a transmission, the status register 1550 accumulates information concerning the circumstances under which the transmission ended and makes this status available to the IOCT 42. In regards to the mode register MR 1555, the mode register contains two mode bits from the data bus 400 from the IOCT 42 One is half speed mode, appliedto the timing generator 1560 , the other is backoff disable, applied to the back off algorithm logic 1545. In regards to the IOC control bus decode 1565, the number of signals for the IOCT 42, collectively called the control bus 485,are decoded by a decode PLA within the IOC decode 1565 to provide signals which perform the following functions first, set and clear the reset logic 1570 set and clear the macro on logic 1577 and load and reset the mode register 1555. In regards to the interfaces, both the SLR 35 and the SLT 40 interface to the shared line 70 on the one side and to the input output controller microcoded for reception or transmission on the other side 37, and 42. In addition, there is an interface between the SLR 35, and theSLT 40 as will be described infra. The SLR to SLT interface consist of two signals from theSLR to the SLT including ERR signifying error indicating a collision, and NENDF4signifying not end flatindicating that carrier is present. In regards to the SLR IOCR interface 35 , 37, the signals between the SLR macros 35 and the IOCR macro 37 are listed infra. TheFWDO 7 from the input buffer 1445 is directed to the IOCR 37 to function as a hold for eight bits of message address, data or status pending tranferred to the buffer not shown of the IOCR 37 of Fig.2. The FWDTAG from the tag register l445A is directed to the IOCR 37 for functioning to hold two tag bits pending transfer to the buffer of the IOCR 37.

It will be noted that Act O 41 known as the action bus 485D and TA, TB, known as the timing signal 485D, all directed to the SLR 35 act to function as the MSO.The DB0 7 known as the data bus 400 is directed to the SLR 35 and functions to transfer mode bits to the mode register 1500 and identification address to the ID register 1480. The FIFOF 460D known as theFFO buffer full is directed to the SLR 35 and notifies FIFO interface control 1495 that FF O buffer is full. The FIFOWR 460C known as theFlFO buffer write is directed to the IOCR 37 and functions whenFFO buffer is not full, writes contents of input buffer 1445 intoF1FO buffer of IOCR37. The FIFOR known as the fifo buffer read is grounded on SLR 35. The PHI, 2, 3 known as clocks to the SLR35 serves to function as the basic timing for the logic of SLR 35 logic.The CLKIN 485D known as clock in to the SLR 35 also functions as a basic timer for the SLR 35 logic. The SYSRSTSYNC 485B known as system reset sync to the SLR 35 functions to synchronize SLR 35 reset In regards to the SLT IOCT interface, the signals between the SLT 40 and IOCT macro 42 are given infra. The FRDO 7 400 to the output buffer is directed to the SLT 40 and functions to hold eight bits of message address or data after transfer from the FIFO buffer of the IOCT 42. The FRDTAG 400 to the tag register 1525A is directed to the SLT 40 and functions as two tag registers for transfers from the FlFO buffer.The MSO known as the mode select 485 includes, the ACTO 1, TA, and TB, all connected to the SLT 40, functions to control the IOC bus signals provided on the SLT 40 to provide load, set or clear signals for functions such as mode register 1555, macro reset, 1570 and macro 1575. A DBO 400 7 is directed to SLT 40 functions to be used to transfer mode bits to the mode register 1555. The FIFOE 460B known as the fifo buffer empty is directed to the SLT 40 and notifies the F FO interface control logic 1535 that theFlFO buffer of IOCT 42 is empty. FIFORD 460A is directed to the IOCT 42 when the FIFO buffer of the IOCT42 is empty to read contents of FD7O buffer to output buffer 1525. The PH1 2 3 485D functions as basic timing for SLT 40 logic. SYSRSTSYNC 40 recessing to the SLT 40 functions to synchronize the SLT 40 reset period. STR2 to the SLT 40 functions to synchronize the SLT 40 reset to the SLT 40 functions to synchronize the SLT 40 reset period.

STRO known as data late to the IOCT 42 functions as a status bit at termination. MC 475A known as message complete to the IOCT 42 functions as a status bit at termination. In regards to the operation, each operation of the SLR 35 or SLT 40 is determined by a command placed in a command control block CCB by the processor 10 responsible for the macro 35 40. The command control block CCB is tranferred from a RAM portion of the memory 15 to the IOCR or IOCT 37 42 respectively and is there implemented by means of signal to the IOCR SLR 37 35 or IOCT SLT 42 40 interfaces. Before a message transfer operation, the identification address in the SLR 35 maybe modified as mode of operation of the SLR 35 or SLT 4should be established.Following the message transfer operation, the SLR 35 or SLT 40 returns status information to its IOCR or IOCT 37 42 which makes it available to the processor 10. In regards to the message format, all messages on the shared line 70 utilize a common format as shown in Fig. 11. This format is set up at the starting location in the RAM portion of the memory 15 pointed to by the memory address in the command control block. A destination of all zeros is interpreted by the SLR 35 to identify a broadcast message and is received by all SLRs 35 on the shared line 70. As a matter of information SLT 40 adds a single start bit in front of the destination address byte and appends to CRC bytes after the last byte of the message. However, the start bit and the CRC bytes are stripped from the messages by the SLR 35 before the message is passed on to the FFObuffer not shown of the IOCR 37. In regards to protocol, the arrangement of information in the body of the message is called protocol, and is not dictated by the SLR and SLT macro 35 40. Protocol is defined by the system software . As an example, protocol may require a transmitter 40 to receive and acknowledge on receiver 35 that a message has been received, also, the transmitter 40 must automatically re transmit it. In regards to commands, two commands are recognized only by the IOCR 37 to implement the IOCR SLR 37 35 interface signal . Two commands are recognized by the SLT 40. Four commands are utilized by both the IOCR 37 and the IOCT 42 as shown in Fig. 12. In regards to IOCR SLR 37 35 commands, the received message 0000 causes the SLR 35 to receive a message from the shared line 70 bearing a destination or broadcast address and passed on to theIOCR 37 to the F1F O buffer not shown of the IOCR 37. The load identification register 1100 causes the contents of the location pointed to by the memory after receiving the CCB to be transferred to the identification address register 1480 on the SLR 35. In regards to IOCT SLT commands, transmit messages 0101 cause the SLT 40 to transmit a message packet of 256 bytes or less, that is a message capable of being specified by a single CCB. In the case of a chain CCB, this command must be contained in a last CCB chain. The transmitted signal mesage 010G cause SLT 40 to transmit a single message packet data supplied by a chain CCB. A chaining may be normal or automatic. The data from memory 15 CCBare added continuously to the data from the previous area of the memory 15. In In regards to common commands, the read FiFO 0011 reads number of bytes plus a CCB byte count from the buffer of the addressed IOCR 37 to the starting location of the memory 15 by the CCB memory address field of subsequent memory locations. If the number in the byte comes to 16 or less theFFO buffer contains 16 locations that number of bytes is read. If the number in the byte count field is greater than 16, the 16 bytes in the buffer are moved in a wraparound manner until the specified number of bytes is removed from the buffer to the memory 15. In conjunction with the write Fll O command, it can be used to effect memory to memory block transfers. The write FDrO 0111 command writes the number of bytes specified by the CCB byte count field from the starting memory location in memory 15 by the CCB memory address field in a subsequent memory location to the fifo buffer of the addressed IOCT 42. If the number in the byte count field is 16 or less, that number of bytes is written. If the number in the byte count is greater than 16 , the data are moved into the 16 bytes buffer in a wrap around manner until a specified number of bytes is moved from memory 15 to the buffer in the IOCT 42. In conjunction with the read FIFO command, this command can be used to effect memory to memory block transfers. The load mode 1110 command, loads contents of the avocation pointed to by the CCB memory address fields to the mode register 1500 1550 described in associated SLR 35 or SLT 40 as diagrammed in Fig. 1 and 2. The RAM location of the memory 15 contains a pertinent mode bits as shown infra First, the promiscuous mode SLR 35 only a one in a bit 2 position causes the SLR 35 to intercept all messages on the shared line 70. This mode may be employed to permit a designated SLR 35 to acquire all messages for record keeping. When the bit is zero, the SLR 35 accepts only messages addressed to it or broadcast messages. Secondly, half speed mode both SLR35 SLT40 , a one in a bit one position causes SLR35 or SLT 40 addressed to run at half speed. When the bit is zero, the SLR 35 or SLT 40 runs at full speed.Speed selection is a system and thirdly, backoff disenable mode SLT 40 Only , a one in a bit zero position causes the backoff algorithm in the SLT 40 to be disenable. This condition may be employed if the backoff algorithm is implemented at the software level. When this bit is zero, the backoff algorithm is enabled. In regards to the No Operation 1111 command, it specifies no operation as most commonly used as the indirect flag of the CCB In regard to the status, both SLR 35 and SLT 40 return four bits of status information through the IOCR 37 or the IOCT 42 at the termination of the IO operation defined by the command. The four bits are stored in the least significant nibble of the status byte as shown in Fig. 13. This byte is available to the processor 10. In regards to the status SLR 40 or 35, the data late reports a data overrun condition in the message being received. A collision reports detection of the collision or noise in the message being received. The CRC error reports a CRC error in the message received Because the CRC check is performed at the end of the message, presence of the status bit means that the entire message has been received. The message end reports that a complete message was received and in association with CRC error defines the circumstances such as message jam equals one CRC of zero indicates typical end, and message one and CRC zero indicates unusual ends. In regards to status SLT 40, data late reports a bit or overrun condition in the message transmission. Retry abort reports that the backoff algorithm has been exhausted and message transmission has been aborted. However, if the backoff is disenabled mode bit is one the status bit is always one. Message abort reports that message transmission is aborted by the SLT 40 because the associated SLR 35 had detected a collision or noise . The SLT 40 does not retry to transmit. It is up to the software to take the next step. The message end reports that transmission of the message has ended signifying that a single CCB or the last CCB of a chain has been completed. If the transmission is aborted, the end message is zero. In regards to status under flag setting, the setting of the control flags and CCB determine whether SLR35 and the SLT 40 will continue to be turned on or off at the termination of an idle operation.The combinations of flag reduce to three sets of conditions as summarized in Fig. 14. In regards to unaffected, if the indirect flag of a CCB is on XXX1 , the SLR 35 and SLT 40 continue to be turned on, permitting theCCB which is the memory addresss of the indirect points to be processed without pause. The presence of the indirect flag overrides the states of the other flags. In regards to turned on not chains, if the CCB is not chained OOXO , the SLR 35 and SLT 40 are turned off at the termination of the I O operations. In regards to the turned off chain, if the CCB is one of a chainjeither normal or automatic 01XO, 10XO, lIXO , the SLR 35 and SLT 40 stay on until the last CCB is processed, and the IO operation is terminated. At this time the SLR 35 and SLT 40 are turned off. In the event that the chain terminates earlier, because of an unusual end, the chain is considered to be broken and the SLR 35 and SLT 40 are turned off. In regards to the byte count, the byte counter 1590 and theSLR 35 or 1585 in the SLT 40 is capable of counting the transfer of up to 256 bytes. An initial byte count of zero is interpreted as 256 bytes. In regards to the SLR 35 byte count, for a message reception the byte count in the CCB is normally set to zero, cauasing the IOCR 37 byte counter 1590 to be inialized as zero count. As the message is received,IOCR 37 byte counter 1590 increments. At the end of the message the byte counter 1590 contains and reports the number of bytes received. In regards to SLT 40 byte count, for message transmission the byte count in the CCB is normally set to indicate the message length and bytes. As the message is transmitted, the IOCT 42 byte counter 1585 decrements.At the completion of message transmission, the byte counter 1585 should have reached a zero count. In regards to identification address, each SLR 35 contains an eight bit identification address register 1480. This address serves as a destination address for messages directed to the SLR 35. It is a source address for messages transmitted by the associated SLT 40. In regards to the physical address therefor, system reset causes the identification address of all SLRs 35 to be initialized to the all ones state XFF . It is up to the program contained in the system level of the RAM portion of the memory 15 toreinitialize a SLR 35 identification register 1480 to an address, unique in the sytem, assigned as a system parameter. This address will serve as a physical address of the SLR 35. However, it may be physically modified or it may be modified by software. In regards to the typical operation, on system reset the following conditions obtain including first, identification address is equal to XFF secondly, half speed mode equals 0 full speed thirdly, promiscuous mode equals zero not accepting all messages fourthly, backoff disable mode equals one backoff algorithm not operational .A typical sequence of operation might be as follows including first, load unique physical identification address secondly, load mode bits promiscuous mode or half speed mode, for receiving thirdly , load mode bits backoff disable mode or half speed mode, for transmitting fourthly, command SLR 35 to receive message, turning it on and enabling it to monitor the shared line 70 fifthly command SLT 40 to transmit message, when one is available and sixthly, when reception or transmission of a message has been terminated, read status byte and analyze it to determine its next command. In regards to programming, examples are presented infra to help to exemplify the above in the form of typical operation the information contain in the specification. In regards to backoff algorithm 1545, assume that the CCB has previously been built at locations x100 as shown in Fig. 15. theSLT 40 is assumed to be connected to IOCT 42. In regards to the promiscuous mode, enable disenable promiscuous mode in SLR 35 is assumed. In this example, same as above except the X200 would contain 00000100 subscript 2. In regards to message transmission, simple message transmission of a four byte message with the interrupt flag set is assumed. It would also be assumed that the CCB has been previously built at location X100. It will be further assumed the message to be located at X200, the destination address XO 2 and the source address isX01 and the SLT 40 is connected to IOCT 42, as shown in Fig. 16. In regards to message received, for a simple message receive using the interrupt feature where software knows the maximum size but the specific masses size. It will also be assumed that the same conditions as given supra except the SLR 35 is connected to IOC R 37 at location 200 is the starting address of a message buffer large enough to accommodate the largest message size. In regards to message transmit, this will be exemplary of a message transmit using a chaining and interrupt feature. Further, for this example, it will be assumed that the message will be 512 bytes long and must be chained. It will be further assumed that the CCB has been previously built by the software at location X100 and the message to.be stored in contiguous memory of memory 15 starting at location X200 as given in Fig. 18. In regards to ring buffer, an exemplary example of creating a simple ring buffer to receive incoming messages is given in Fig. 19 in a contiguous area of the memory 15. In regards to transmit message chain, the example of a message transmit using the transmit message and transmit segmented message command. A 356 byte message will be transmitted using normal chaining. Assume the CCB to have been previously built by software at location X100 and the message to be stored in contiguous memory of memory 15 starting at X200 as shown in Fig. 20. In regards to transmit message auto chain, this is analogous to the supra example, but uses auto chaining as shown in Fig. 21. In regards to write read F1FO, it will be assumed that it uses the write and read FlFOcommand to move 16 bytes of data from locationX200 to X300. It would be further assumed that the CCB is to be located at X100 as shown in Fig. 22.
