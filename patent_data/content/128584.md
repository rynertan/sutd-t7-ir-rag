## Description
DIHYDROFURAN DERIVATIVES USEFUL AS AROMA CHEMICALS, AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION This invention relates to dihydrofuran derivatives and particularly to certain 2,4,5 substituted 2, 3 dihydrofurans which are useful fragrance compounds, as well as the process for the isomerization of cyclopropyl ketones to 2,3 dihydrofurans. More specifically, the process involves the catalytic rearrangement isomerization of 1, 1 disubstituted 2 hydrocarbylcyclopropanes, wherein one of the substituents in the 1 position is an acyl group, to 2,4,5 substituted 2,3 dihydrofurans. The use of synthetic fragrance chemicals has added a new dimension to the art of perfumery. As a result of the development of new synthetic perfume chemicals, perfumers have greater flexibility in developing fragrance formulations and are better able to mimic natural aromas. However, as perfumers become more adept in the use of synthetic materials for the formulation of sophisticated fragrances and developing the subtle nuances typically associated with natural fragrances, there is a growing demand for new synthetic fragrance compounds. Furan derivatives are known to have desirable fragrance and flavor qualities. For example, Ethyl furoate, n amvl furoate, ethyl furylg hydroxypropionate and furfural are reported for use in perfumes, cosmetics and soaps.Furfuryl alkyl and aryl ethers are disclosed as flavor enhancers in U.S. Patent No. 3,940,502. Tetrahydrofurans are also disclosed for fragrance applications. U.S. Patent No.3,668,134 discloses the use of esters or ethers of tetrahydrofurans as perfumery ingredients for detergent compositions. 3 Oximino 4 oxo 2, 5 dimethyltetrahydrofuran is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,116,982 and disclosed to have a fine caramel like fragrance making it useful for the manufacture of scents and flavors. U.S. Patent No. 3,470,209 discloses 2 acetonyl 3,5 dimethyl 5 isopropyl tetrahydrofuran as having a pleasant spicy odor reminiscent of bay and eucalyptus. 2 1 Hydroxymethyl ethyl 5 methyl 5 vinyl tetrahydrofuran is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,764,567 as a useful ingredient for incorporation in floral perfumes. In U.S.Patent No. 3,227,731 carbonates of 1 furyl 2,2 dialkyI 1, 3 dihydroxypropanes and 1 alpha tetrahydrofuryl 2,2 dialkyl 1, 3 dihydroxypropanes are indicated to be useful in perfume compounding. 2,3 Dihydrofurans having a vinyl group at the 2 position, a lower carboxylate radical at the 4 position and a methyl group at the 5 position have been reported inChemical Abstracts, Volume 75, 87758y 1971 Volume 93, 71095r 1980 Volume 93, 239112v 1980 and Volume 94, 15458v 1981 . Additionally, in Chemical Abstracts Volume 96, 52099r 1982 , substituted 2,3 dihydrofurans obtained by the oxidative addition of 1,3 dicarbonyl compounds with dienes in the presence of manganese III and copper II acetates are reported. None of the reported 2,3 diydro furans have a higher alkyl group substituted in the 5 position and there is no indication that any of the compounds have useful fragrance qualities. A procedure for the preparation of substituted dihydrofurans is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,18Q,445 4,198,341 4,198,342 and 4,198,343 to Schmidt. The process involves reacting a ss alkoxycrotonic acid ester or 3,3 bisalkoxybutyric acid ester with a 1,1,1 trihalogen 4 methyl 3 pentene 2 ol or 1,1,1 trihalogen 4 methyl 4 pentene 2 ol in the presence of an acid catalyst. 2,4,4 Trimethyl 3 carbalkoxy 5 4, dihalogenvinyl 4 ,5 dihydrofurans are produced in the process. Alonso et al. in J. Org. Chem., 45, 4530 4532 1980 report the rearrangement of cyclopropyl ketones to 4,5 dihydrofurans at room temperature using aluminum oxide.The rearrangement is accomplished by passing the cyclopropyl ketone in chloroform through a neutral alumina column.Whereas nearly quantitative yields of the dihydrofuranEMI3.1 are obtained, contact times of from 24 to 72 hours are required. Tishchenko et al. Chemical Abstracts, 9, 1981 , 15229nz describe the ring opening of 1 acetyl 2,2dichlorocyclopropanes in the presence of sodium alcoholates.Depending on the amount of sodium alcoholate used, a dihydrofuran or alkyne is produced. Dihydrofurans are also reported by Bahurel et al.in Bull. Soc. Chim. France, 1971 6 , 2203 8 as a by product from the reaction of 1,4 dichlorobutene 2 and sodium ethyl acetylacetate in an alcoholic solution. U.S. Patent No. 4,252,739 to Fayter, Jr. et al.describes a phase transfer process for the preparation of vinylcyclopropane derivatives by reacting an alkylating agent and a activated methylene compound using an onium catalyst and in the presence of an alkali metal compound and water.Whereas alkylation of the activated carbon atom is predominantly obtained, when the activated methylene compound contains an acyl moiety, e.g. ethyl acetoacetate, up to about 15 percent dihydrofuran by product can be obtained as a result of alkylation at the oxygen atom of the acyl group. Dihydrofurans have also been obtained from the rearrangement of acids or light by McGreer et al., Can. J.Chem., 51 10 , 1487 93 1973 Armitage et al., J.Am. Chem.Soc., 81, 2437 40 1959 Wilson, .T. Am. Chem. Soc., 69, 3002 3 1947 and Dauben et al., J. Org. Chem., 34, 2301 6 1969 . While it is known to obtain dihydrofurans from cyclopropyl ketones, it is evident from the above mentioned references that a variety of other rearrangement products are produced depending upon the reaction conditions employed.Accordingly, it would be highly advantageous if other processes were available whereby dihydrofurans could be specifically obtained by the rearrangement of cyclopropyl ketones. In accordance with the present invention, a novel class is provided of 2,4,5 trisubstituted 2,3 dihydro√ßurans of the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein R is an ethyl or vinyl group, R2 is a C14 alkyl group and R1 is a C3 10 hydrocarbon radical. The 2,4, 5 trisubstituted 2, 3 dihydrofurans having the following formula are useful as fragrance compounds for a variety of applications and have the general formulaEMI5.1 wherein R is an ethyl or vinyl group, R2 is an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R1 is a hydrocarbon radical having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms. R2 can be a straight chain or branched radical such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, tert butyl and sec butyl. The hydrocarbon radical R1 can be an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic group. When R1 is an aliphatic radical it can be straight chain or branched and may be saturated or contain unsaturation. Useful cycloaliphatic radicals from which R is selected will have from 3 to 6 carbon atoms in the ring and may be saturated or unsaturated.Especially useful cycloaliphatic radicals are the cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclopentadienyl and cyclohexadienyl which also have one or more alkyl groups substituted thereon. Useful aromatic groups from which R1 is selected include phenyl, benzyl, and C14 alkyl or C1 4 alkoxy substituWed phenyl or benzyl. Illustrative compounds within the above definition include 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl 2 ethyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 methyl 2 ethyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran 4 carbomethoxy 5 ethyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 ethyl 2 ethyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran 4 carbomethoxy 5 n pentyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 n pentyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 n pentyl 2 ethyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 3 methyl butyl 2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 3 methyl butyl 2 ethyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 4 methyl 3 pentenyl 2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 4 methyl 3 pentenyl 2 ethyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran 4 carbomethoxy 5 phenyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 phenyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 phenyl 2 ethyl 2 , 3 dihydrofuran 4 carbomethoxy 5 phenyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 4 carbomethoxy 5 phenyl 2 ethyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 4 carbomethoxy 5 p tolyl 2 ethyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 4 carbethoxy 5 p methoxyphenyl 2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran 4 carboisopropoxy 5 isopropyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 4 carboisopropoxy 5 isopentenyl 2 ethyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran and the like. Particularly useful 2,4,5 trisubstituted 2, 3 dihydrofurans, in view of their highly desirable fragrance characteristics, are those compounds where R is ethyl or vinyl, R1 is methyl or ethyl and R1 is a C38 alkyl or alkenyl group. The 2,3 dihydrofurans of this invention are generally characterized as having a pleasing, natural fragrance. By varying the ring substituents, it is possible to mimic a number of natural aromas such as, for example, woody, herbaceous, green, nutty, fruity, or vegetable aromas. Most typically several of these notes will be present in the fragrance even though one note may be predominant. These fragrances are intense, without being overwhelming, and have good diffusivity, stability and dryout characteristics. The 2,4,5 trisubstituted 2,3 dihydrofurans are useful components in the preparation and formulation of fragranced products such as perfumes, shampoos, deodorants, shaving creams and gels, body lotions and creams, detergent and bar soaps, and the like. They may be employed as the sole fragrance material but most generally are used in conjunction with other fragrance materials. When combined with other fragrance materials, the 2,3 dihydrofuran will be present from trace amounts up to about 50 percent of the fragrance formulation, depending on the particular fragrance desired and the end use application. The process of this invention generally relates to the preparation of 2,3 dihydrofurans from the corresponding cyclopropyl ketone compound by catalytic isomerization. More specifically, the process involves the rearrangement isomerization of l,l disubstituted 2 dlkylcyclopropanes or 1, 1 disubstituted 2 alkenylcyclopropanes, wherein one of the substituents in the 1 position is an acyl group, to 2,4,5 substituted 2,3 dihydrofurans employing an onium compound as the catalyst. By the process it is possible to readily obtain a wide variety of 4,5 disubstituted 2 alkyl or alkenyl 2,3 dihydrofurans. It is also possible with the present process to treat products which contain a mixture of the vinylcyclopropane and dihydrofuran moieties to increase the amount of the dihydrofuran. For the process, l,l disubstituted2 hydrocarbylcyclopropanes, wherein one of the substituents in the l position is an acyl group, are employed. The 1, 1 disubstituted 2 hydrocarbylcyclopropanes, which are also referred to herein as cyclopropyl ketone compounds, correspond to the general formulaEMI8.1 where R and R1 are hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 24 carbon atoms and X is a carboxylate, nitrile, amide or sulfonyl group. It is evident from the formula that a wide variety of cyclopropyl ketones can be utilized in the process of this invention to prepare 2,3 dihydrofurans. The process further encompasses the use of various geometric and stereo isomers of these cyclopropyl ketones and mixtures and racemates thereof. Hydrocarbyl groups, i.e., radicals comprised of carbon and hydrogen only, from which R1 is selected can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic. When R1 is an aliphatic group, it can be straight chain or branched, saturated or unsaturated, and preferably contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Unsaturated aliphatic radicals will generally have no more than one double bond for every four carbon atoms. Useful cycloaliphatic radicals from which RI is selected can contain from 3 to 24 carbon atoms, however, preferred cycloaliphatic radicals have from 5 to 20 carbon atoms and correspond to the formulaEMI9.1 where m is an integer from 0 t9 8, and more preferably 0 to 4, A represents a non aromatic 5 or 6 membered carbon ring system, and r and r are hydrogen, C1 8 alkyl, C18 alkenyl, phenyl or benzyl.Particularly advantageou cycloaliphatic radicals are those wherein the moiety is an unsubstituted or mono C18 alkyl orEMI9.2 alkenyl substituted cyclopropyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclo hexyl, cyclohexenyl or cyclohexa 2,4 dienyl group.If R1 is an aromatic hydrocarbon group it will contain from 6 to 24 carbon atoms and may consist of a single ring or fused ring system which can one or more hydrocarbon groups substituted thereon. Especially useful aromatic radicals contain from 6 to 18 carbon atoms and correspond to the formulaEMI9.3 where m, r and r are the same as defined above. Preferred aromatic radicals include phenyl, C18 alkyl or alkenyl substituted phenyl, benzyl and C18 a lkyl or alkenyl substituted benzyl. The ring may also contain other substituents such as halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxy, carboxylate and the like. The hydrocarbyl radical R containing from 1 to 24 carbon atoms can be an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic radical of the general type described above for R1. Most generally, however, R is a C28 aliphatic hydrocarbon radical which can be straight chain or branched and can be saturated or unsaturated. If R is unsaturated, it generally will have no more than one double bond. Vinyl and vinylene groups are particularly useful unsaturated aliphatic radicals. The process is particularly useful for the isomerization of cyclopropyl ketones wherein R is vinyl or ethyl. X is a carboxylate, nitrile, amide or sulfonyl group respectively having the formulaEMI10.1 EMI10.2 andEMI10.3 where R2, R4, and R5 are hydrocarbyl radicals as defined above for R1 and R3 is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical as defined above for R1.For the process, it is particularly useful when the hydrocarbyl radicals from which R2, R3, R4 and R5 are selected are C14 alkyl, phenyl, C1 4 alkvl substituted phenyl, benzyl or C 1 4 alkyl substituted benzyl. For the process of this invention, the cyclopropyl ketone is heated in the presence of an onium catalyst to effect isomerization. The reaction can be represented by the general equation EMI11.1 wherein X, R and R1 are the same as previously defined. Temperatures for the reaction will range from about 60 C to about 2000C and best results are obtained at temperatures from about 800C to 1700C. The onium catalyst is employed in an amount from about 0.5 to 20 weight percent, based on the cyclopropyl ketone. Most generally the onium catalyst is present from about 2 to 15 weight percent. While it is not necessary for the reaction, the use of a solvent or diluent may be advantageous in some instances. For example, when the cyclopropyl ketone is a solid or viscous fluid, handling of the material can be facilitated by dissolving in a small amount of a suitable solvent or diluent. Any solvent diluent should be inert and not react with the cyclopropyl ketone, 2,3 dihydrofuran or oniun catalyst under the conditions employed for the reaction. It is also advantageous if the solvent has a boiling point above the reaction temperature. Lower boiling solvents can be used, however, this necessitates the use of closed reactors autoclaves , etc.If the product is to be recovered by distillation, the boiling point of the solvent should also be such that it can be readily separated from the 2,3 dihydrofuran and any unreacted cyclopropyl ketone at the conclusion of the reaction. Useful solvents diluents which can be used for the process include dimethyl sulfoxide dimethyl sulfone sulfolane dimethyl formamide N methyl 2 pyrrolidone hexamethylphosphoramide triglyme and the like. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the onium catalyst is dissolved in the cyclopropyl ketone and the process is conducted neat, i.e., in the absence of additional solvent or diluent. Onium compounds useful as catalysts for this invention include quaternary ammonium and phosphonium compounds having at least 6 carbon atoms and corresponding to the formulaEMI12.1 where M is nitrogen or phosphorous, R represents a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 22 carbon atoms and A is halide, preferably chloride or bromide. The hydrocarbon radicals R nay be the same or different and include alkyl groups, which can be saturated, unsaturated, branched or straight chain, phenyl, C14 alkyl substituted phenyl, benzyl or C14 alkyl substituted benzyl. Particularly useful onium catalysts contain at least 10 carbon atoms.Illustrative onium compounds which can be used as catalysts for the process of this invention include tetrabutylammonium chloride tetrabutylammonium bromide dimethyldibenzylammonium chloride dirnethyldibenzylammonium bromide trimethylbenzylammonium chloride trimethylbenzylammonium bromide tricaprylylmethylammonium chloride tricaprylylmethylammonium bromide tributylhexadecylphosphonium chloride tributylhexadecylphosphonium bromide and the like. The cyclopropyl ketones employed in the process should be essentially free of water and caustic. For this reason, cyclopropyl ketones obtained via classical or phase transfer condensation are generally treated prior to use to remove water, caustic and inorganic salts. For example, in the situation where the cyclopropyl ketone is obtained via the phase transfer process of U.S. Patent o. 4,252,739, the resulting crude cyclopropyl ketone product may be filtered to remove insoluble inorganic salts or these salts may be dissolved in water followed by separation of the organic and aqueous phases. Residual caustic may be neutralized with dilute acid prior to filtration or dissolution of the salts. The organic phase obtained after the above treatment may then be treated with drying agents to remove water. Most generally, however, the organic phase is stripped or distilled under reduced pressure to remove water and any organic solvent present therein. EXAMPLE 1 Methyl 1 acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropane 1 carboxylate was prepared by the reaction of 1,4 dichlorobutene 2 and methyl acetoacetate using the classical condensation procedure. For the reaction, methyl sodioacetoacetate was prepared by first reacting 36.6 grams sodium metal with 500 mls anhydrous methanol and then adding 185.6 grams of the methyl acetoacetic ester The resulting solution was then added dropwise, at a rate sufficient to maintain reflux, to 100 grams 1,4 dichlorobutene 2 in 200 mls methanol under a nitrogen atmosphere. After addition was complete, refluxing was continued for 3 hours followed by stirring overnight at ambient temperature. The resulting reaction product IA was then stripped under reduced pressure after filtering to remove insoluble salts.Fractional distillation yielded 55 percent yield of a product IB consisting predominantly of the desired vinylcyclopropane product boiling point 83.50C85.00C at 4.5 mm Hg nD 1.4705 . Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatographic analysis of IB showed the product to consist of 85.7 percent methyl l acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropane 1 carboxylate and 14.3 percent 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran. To demonstrate the rearrangement, 2 grams of IB was combined with 0.24 gram tricaprylylmethylammonium chloride and heated at 1000C. After 20 hours, the methyl l acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropane 1 carboxylate was reduced to 11.6 percent. The bulk of product 76.3 percent was confirmed to be 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran. Heating for 20 additional hours increased the amount of 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran in the mixture to 83.3 percent. When IB was heated for 20 hours by itself there was essentially no change in the amounts of methyl l acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropane l carboxylate and 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran 85.4 percent and 14.6 percent, respectively. Heating IA for 20 hours at 100or in a closed reactor autoclave gave essentially no change in the relative proportions of the methyl 1 acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropane l carboxylate and 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran. EXAMPLE 2 Two grams of product IB was combined with 0.16 gram dibenzyldimethylammonium chloride and the mixture heated at 1000C. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatographic analysis confirmed that the resulting rearranged product, obtained after 20 hours, contained 74.5 percent 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2 , 3 dihydrofuran and 25.2 percent methyl 1 acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropane 1carboxylate. EXAMPLE 3 Product IB 2 grams was combined with 0.30 gram tri n butylhexadecylphosphonium bromide and the mixture heated at 100 C. After 7 hours the amount of methyl 1 acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropane 1 carboxylate present in the mixture was reduced to 52 percent and 44 percent 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran was present. Continuing the heating for an additional 12 hours increases the amount of 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2 , 3 dihydrofuran in the mixture to about 75 percent. EXAMPLE 4 To demonstrate the criticality of the catalyst for the rearrangement, Example 3 was repeated except that tetramethylammonium bromide was substituted for the tri n butylhexadecylphosphonium bromide at the same mole percent level. After heating for 20 hours at 1000C the amount of 4 carbomethoxy 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran in the mixture was essentially unchanged. EXMPLE 5 Essentially pure l acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropane carboxanilide melting point 1040C 104.70C was obtained by recrystallization from isopropanol and rearranged to 4 carboxanilide 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran in accordance with the process of this invention. For the reaction, 0.5 gram 1 acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropanecarboxanilide was combined with 89 milligrams tricaprylylmethylammonium chloride and heated at 1000C for one hour. Analysis indicated approximately 70 percent conversion of the l acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropane carboxanilide to 4 carboxanilide 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2, 3 dihydrofuran. With additional heating there was a further increase in the amount of 4 carboxanilide 5 methyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran produced.When the reaction was repeated using 62 milligrams tetrabutylammonium chloride as the catalyst, 80 percent conversion of the l acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropanecarboxanilide to 4 carboxanilide5 methyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran was obtained after one hour. No rearrangement was observed when the 1 acetyl 2 vinylcyclopropanecarboxanilide was heated at 1000C in the absence of an onium catalyst. VEX APPLE 6 In accordance with the phase transfer procedure ofU.S. Patent No. 4,252,739, ethyl 2 vinyl 1 hexanoylcyclopro pane 1 carboxylate was obtained from the reaction of 0.53 mole ethyl hexanoyl acetateEMI17.1 0.66 mole 1,4 dichlorobutene 2, and 1.06 moles potassium hydroxide. The reaction was carried out in a mixture of water and methylene chloride utilizing 0.0133 mole tricaprylylmethyl ammonium chloride as the phase transfer catalyst. The resulting reaction product was then filtered through a sintered glass funnel to remove excess potassium hydroxide.and insoluble salts formed during the reaction and neutralized with 10 percent sulfuric acid.The crude product obtained after drying and removal of the methylene chloride contained approximately 95 percent ethyl 2 vinyl 1 hexanoyl cyclopropane 1 carboxylate. The ethyl 2 vinyl 1 hexanoylcyclopropane 1 carboxylate obtained above 120 grams was combined with 25.6 grams tricaprylylmethylammonium chloride and heated at 1100C under a nitrogen atmosphere with agitation to isomerize the cyclopropyl ketone to the corresponding 2,3 dihydrofuran.After three hours, gas chromatographic analysis showed the reaction mixture to contain 41 percent 4 carbethoxy 5 npentyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran. Heating was continued at 1100C until the 4 carbethoxy 5 n pentyl 2 vinyl 2,3dihydrofuran content was increased to 87 percent. By distillation it was possible to obtain essentially pure 4 carbethoxy 5 n pentyl 2 vinyl 2 , 3 dihydrofuran. The 4 carbethoxy 5 n pentyl 2 vinyl 2 , 3 dihydrofuran was a clear, colorless liquid B.P. 103 1090C commat 2 mm Hg nD 1.4709 and had a pleasing fragrance useful in Jasmone and or citrus formulations. nmr CDC131 1.28 t, 3H CH3 CH2 O CO 4.23 q, 2H CH3 CH2 O CO 0.90 t, 3H CH3 CH2 CH2 1.10 1.80 m, 6 methylene H 2.50 3.55 n, 2 ring methylene H 2.70 br.t., 2 methylene H. adj. to ring 4.80 5.55 m, 3 vinyl H , 5.70 6.34 m, 1 ring H .

For the reaction, 13 grams 4 carbethoxy 5 npentyl 2 vinyl 2,3 dihydrofuran and 75 mls ethyl acetate were charged to the reactor of a Parr apparatus.
