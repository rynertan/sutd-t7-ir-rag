# Test tube assembly, kit for making it and method of manual immunoassay.

## Abstract
A two part test tube assembly useful in immunoassays comprises a series of test tubes 4,33 firmly located in a support 3,31 , with the lower portions of the tubes depending a uniform distance below the support, and a magnetic base member comprising a planar base 10,41 having one or more magnets 15 permanently located therein. Means are provided to releasably couple the test tube support to the magnetic base member, for example the base member may have upstanding side walls 11, 12, 16 with a groove 13, 14, 17 at the top to slidably receive side flanges 6,7 on the test tube support. The assembly so formed can be inverted manually as a unit, to decant liquid from the test tubes whilst retaining magnetic solids in the tubes under the continuing influence of the magnets. The magnetic material remaining in the tubes can then be assayed. In a preferred embodiment, the arrangement of test tubes in support matches the arrangement of orifices 21 in a multi head counter 20 to permit the lower portions of the tubes to be simultaneously received in the counter.
