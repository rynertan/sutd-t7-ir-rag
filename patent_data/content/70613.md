## Abstract
A video fruit machine has a display screen 5 consti tuted by the screen of a cathode ray tube. Electronic circuitry of the machine operates to provide video sig nals to the cathode ray tube to produce on the screen an image of four columns 1 to 4 of symbols, each col umn having a plurality of symbol positions 6 and re presenting the visible periphery of a fruit machine reel rotatable about anaxis parallel to the screen. During a game the electronic circuitry of the machine changes the displayed image in such a way that the symbols of a column travel up or down the column to disappear at the top or bottom of the column and be replaced by new symbols added to the bottom or top of the column, thereby simulating the rotation of reels in a mechanical fruit machine employing rotatable reels. At the end of a game, the movement of the symbol is stopped and the combination of symbols in the resulting final static image normally determines whether or not a player has won. Various measures are taken to simulate accurately the appearance and performance of mechanical reels. However, the parameters of the simulated reels, parti cularly the apparently visible reel periphery, are made variable by electronic means.
