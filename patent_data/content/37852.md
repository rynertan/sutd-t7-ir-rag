# Connection for superconductive circuitry.

## Abstract
Circuit connection for electrical circuitry, and particu larly superconducting circuits including Josephson tunnel ling devices, wherein solder lands can be used to make electrical connection to electric lines without interdiffusion between the lines and the solder. To avoid the interdiffusion problem, a laterally extend ing metallic layer 18 is used as a diffusion barrier bet ween the solder land 28 and the electrical line M which can be a superconducting line. The diffusion layer is comprised of refractory metal and has a first portion electrically contacting the solder land and a second, later ally displaced portion, electrically contacting the electrical line. An insulating layer 22 on the diffusion barrier layer separates the solder land and the electrical line. In a speci fic embodiment, the diffusion barrier is comprised of niobium, and the solder is a low melting point alloy, typi cally comprised of indium, bismuth, and tin.
