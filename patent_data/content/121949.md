DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention comprises detergent compositions containing an essential two component detergent surfactant system consisting of a synthetic anionic detergent surfactant and specific cationic surfactants. This specific two component detergent surfactant system is an effective detergent and is particularly effective on organic soils, for example, lipid, greasy and oily soils. The detergent compositions within the invention also provide the desired superior performance over a wide range of wash water temperatures. Such temperature can range from as low as about 50C to about 950C. It is preferred that the initial pH of the wash liquor i.e., the detergent composition and wash water mixture, be greater than about 8 and most preferably from about 9 to about 11. The detergent compositions within the invention can be in any form, such as granules, liquids, tablets or pastes, but the granular compositions are preferred.The granules can range in density from about .15 grams cubic centimeter to about .8 grams cubic centimeter. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the detergent compositions within the invention provide the desired superior performance on organic soils because the synthetic anionic detergent surfactant and the cationic surfactant form an electro neutral complex.The mechanism of organic soil removal is believed to be based upon the surfactant adsorbing to the soil surface to reduce the soil water interfacial tension to such an extent that the mechanical action of the washing process removes soil from the textile surface. Since the complexes formed are electrically neutral and, therefore, do not repel each other, they can pack densely when they adsorb onto the soil surface. This results in a much lower soil water interfacial tension and thereby provides extremely effective soil removal. However, surprisingly, it has been observed that the cationic surfactants that are generally used in the art, for example, C12 trimethyl ammonium chloride, result in the electro neutral complex crystallizing or becoming highly viscous under wash water temperatures below about 450C. Thus, the electro neutral complex does not provide the desired superior performance. Surprisingly, the electro neutral complex does not crystallize or become highly viscous with the cationic surfactants of the invention. This is believed to be why the detergent compositions of the invention are particularly efficacious under wash water temperatures as low as about 50C. The following is a detailed description of the essential and the optional components of the detergent compositions within the invention. All percentages, parts and ratios are by weight unless otherwise indicated. THE CATIONIC SURFACTANT The cationic surfactant is an essential component of the compositions within the invention. Without the cationic surfactant, the electro neutral complex cannot be formed with the synthetic anionic detergent surfactant and, therefore, the desired superior performance is not obtained. Though, theoretically, essentially any cationic surfactant within the invention can be utilized to provide such benefit, nitrogenous surfactants that are cationic or capAble of existing in cationic form are the most practicable. Also, the cationic surfactants within the invention can be saturated or unsaturated and contain straight and or branched chains. The cationic surfactants within the invention are selected from the group consisting of i compounds having the general formula R2 OR3 m12 R4 OR3 if Q is S wherein Q is N, P or S z is 1 if Q is S 2 and 2 if Q is N or P each R is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl or alkyl benzyl group containing from about 4 to about 10 carbon atoms excluding the benzyl group each R is selected from the group consisting of CH2CH2 , CH2CH CH3 , CH2CH CH2OH , CH2CH2CH 2, and mixtures thereof and wherein the sum of the carbon atoms of R2 OR3 m12 is from about 10 carbon atoms to about 15 carbon atoms, prefer ably no more than about 14 carbon atoms, when m is 0 and from about 10 carbon atoms to about 18 carbon atoms when m is from 1 to about 3, a benzene ring being treated as equivalent to about 2 carbon atoms each R4 is selected from the group consisting of H when y is not 0, C13 alkyl, C14 hydroxyalkyl, benzyl groups, ring structures formed by join ing the two R groups, and CH2CHOHCHOH CHOR6CHOHCH2OR6 wherein R6 is H or any hexose and wherein at least one R6 is H each y is from 0 to about 3, each m is from 0 to about 3 and wherein m is 1 when R is CH2CH2 and X is any com patible anion, particularly one selected froiq the group consisting of halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate and acetate anions and mixtures thereof ii compounds having the general formula EMI10.1 wherein Q, R3, R4, y, m and X are as defined above n is 2 if Q is S and 3 ifQ is N or P each R5 is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl or alkyl benzyl group containing at least about 1 carbon atom excluding the benzyl group and wherein the sum of the carbon atoms of R3O mR5 2 is from about 9 carbon atoms to about 15, preferably 14, carbon atoms when m is 0 and from about 10 carbon atoms to about 18 carbon atoms when m is from I to about 3, a benzene ring being treated as equivalent to about 2 carbon atoms and a is from 0 to about 3 iii aliphatic amines having the general formula R2 OR3 m12 R4 OR3 yiN wherein Rê, R , R4, m and y are as defined above and the pKa is at least about 1 2 unit above the initial pH of the wash liquor iv compounds having the general formula EMI11.1 wherein R , R3, , m, y and X are as defined above and v compounds having the general formula EMI11.2 wherein Rê, R , R4, m and y are as defined above and the pKa is at least about 1 2 unit above the initial pH of the wash liquor and mixtures thereof. Because of their practicability, nitrogenous surfactants, which are described in i and ii when Q isN, iii , iv and v are the preferred cationic surfactants. In iv and v , preferably both R2 OR3 m groups are on the same N. Especially preferred are the alkyl quaternary ammonium surfactants which are described in i and ii . The most preferred cationic surfactants are the chloride, bromide and methylsulfate salts of the alkyl quaternary ammonium surfactants which 2 are described in i when each R2 is an alkyl group containing from 4 to about 10 carbon atoms and wherein 2 3 the sum of the carbon atoms of R OR m12 is from about 10 carbon atoms to about 14 carbon atoms and preferably from about 10 to about 12 carbon atoms each m and y are 4.1 or 0, preferably 0 and each R is selected from the group consisting of methyl and hydroxyethyl. Also, most preferred are the chloride, bromide and methylsulfate salts of the alkyl quaternary ammonium surfactants which 5.are described in ii when each R is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group containing at least one carbon atom and said R5 groups optionally can be joined to form ring structures containing from five to six carbon atoms and wherein the sum of the carbon atoms 3 5 of R 0 mR 2 is from about 9 to about 15 carbon atoms and preferably from about 10 to about 14 carbon atoms each m and y are 1 or 0, preferably 0 and each R4 is selected from thX group consisting of methyl and hydroxyethyl. As an option, the salts of the cationic surfactants can be prepared by precomplexing the cationic surfactant directly with an anionic detergent surfactant within the invention rather than having such complex be formed in the wash liquor. It is essential that cationic surfactants derived from aliphatic amines have a pKa at least about 1 2 unit above the initial pH of the wash liquor. Otherwise, the desired superior performance is not achieved. It is believed that such a pKa and pH limitation ensures that a substantial portion of such amines are protonated and, thus, exist in cationic form and, therefore, are able to complex with the sulfonate detergent surfactant. The level of cationic surfactant within the invention is related to the level of the synthetic anionic detergent surfactant. Equimolar ratios of cationic surfactant and the anionic detergent surfactant form the electro neutral complex that is essential to provide the desired superior performance. However, it is preferred that there be a molar excess of the synthetic anionic detergent surfactant for proteinaceous and particulate soil removal and the suspension in the wash liquor of the soil removed from the textiles. Such soil suspension prevents soil redeposition. Such molar excess of synthetic anionic surfactant is also desirable because it is effective at stripping fabric softeners that have been deposited on the textile surface during previ ,us wash cycles.Therefore, the molar ratio of cationic surfactant synthetic anionic detergent surfactant is less than about 1, preferably less than about 0.5 and most preferably less than about 0.25. Additionally, as discussed hereinbelow, in a preferred embodiment the detergent compositions within the invention contain a detergency builder and a nonionic surfactant. The level of cationic surfactant in such compositions is from about 1 4 to about 12 , preferably from about 1 2 to about 8 and most preferably from about 1 to about 6 . THE SYNTHETIC ANIONIC DETERGENT SURFACTANTIt is believed that the performance of essentially any synthetic anionic detergent surfactant can be enhanced by utilizing it within the compositions of the invention. Preferred synthetic anionic detergent surfactants are water soluble salts of alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkyl polyethoxy ether sulfates, paraffin sulfonates, alpha olefin sulfonates, alpha sulfocarboxylates and their esters, alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonates, fatty acid monoglyceride sulfates and sulfonates, alkyl phenol polyethoxy ether sulfates, 2 acyloxyalkane 1 sulfonates, and beta alkyloxy alkane sulfonates. Especially preferred alkyl benzene sulfonates have about 9 to about 15 carbon atoms in a linear or branched alkyl chain, more preferably about 11 to about 13 carbon atoms. Suitable alkyl sulfates have about 10 to about 22 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, more preferably from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms and most preferably from about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms. Suitable alkyl polyethoxy ether sulfates have about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain and have an average of about 1 to about 12 CH2CH2 0 groups per molecule, preferably about I to about 6 CH2CH2O groups per molecule. Suitable paraffin sulfonates are essentially linear and contain from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms.Suitable alphaolefin sulfonates have about 10 to about 24 carbon. atoms, more preferably about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms alpha olefin sulfonates can be made by reaction with sulfur trioxide followed by neutralization under conditions such that any sultones present are hydrolyzed to thecorresponding hydroxy alkane sulfonates. Suitable alpha sulfocarboxylates contain from about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms included herein are not only the salts of alpha sulfonated fatty acids but also their esters made from alcohols containing about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms. Suitable alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonates are ethers of alcohols having about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms, more preferably those derived from coconut oil and tallow. Suitable alkyl phenol polyethoxy ether sulfates have about 8 to about 14 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain and an average of about 1 to about 6 CH2CH2O groups per molecule. Suitable 2 acyloxy alkane 1 sulEonates contain from about 2 to about 9 carbon atoms in the acyl group and about 9 to about 23 carbon atoms in the alkane moiety. Suitable beta alkyloxy alkane sulfonates contain about 1 to about 3 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms in the alkane moiety. The alkyl chains of the foregoing synthetic anionic detergent surfactants can be derived from natural sources such as coconut oil or tallow, or can be made synthetically as, for example, using the Ziegler or Oxo processes. Water solubility can be achieved by using alkali metal, ammonium, or alkanol ammonium cations sodium is preferred. The level of synthetic anionic detergent surfactant within the detergent compositions of the invention when such compositions contain a detergency builder and a nonionic surfactant is from about 5 to about 60 , preferably from about 7 to about 50 and most preferably from about 10 to about 40 . THE LAUNDRY ADDITIVE PRODUCT A second aspect of this invention is a laundry additive product in the form of the cationic surfactants within the invention in water releasable combination with nonparticulatq flexible substrates. Such laundry additive products are of great practicality since conventional detergent compositions generally contain a synthetic anionic detergent. Thus, the addition of the laundry additive product to the wash water results in the electro neutral complex being formed in the wash liquor and, thereby, provides the benefits of the detergent compositions of the invention. The weight ratio of cationic surfactant to substrate is from about 30 to about 0.1 and preferably from about 10 to about 0.3. Optionally, the cationic surfactant and an anionic detergent surfactant, as described hereinbelow, can be present on the substrate, optionally in the form of a complex. The substrate may itself be water soluble or water insoluble and in the latter case it should possess sufficient structural integrity under the conditions of the wash to be recovered from the machine at the end of the laundry cycle. Structures which are water disintegratable, i.e., that break down in aqueous media to insoluble individual fibers or particles, are not considered satisfactory for the purposes of the present invention. Water soluble materials include certain cellulose ethers, polyethylene oxide alginates, polyvinyl alcohol and water soluble polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, which can be formed into nonwoven and woven fibrous structures. Suitable water insoluble materials include, but are not restricted to, natural and synthetic fibers, foams, sponges and films. The substrate may have any one of a number of physical forms such as sheets, blocks, rings, balls, rods or tubes. Such forms should be amenable to unit usage by the consumer, i.e., they should be capable of addition to the washing liquor in measured amounts, such as individual sheets, blocks or balls and unit lengths of rods or tubes. Certain of these substrate types can also be adapted for single or multiple uses, and can be provided with loadings of cationic surfactant up to a cationic surfactant substrate ratio of 30 1. One such article comprises a sponge material releasably enclosing enough cationic surfactant to provide the desired superior performance during several washing cycles. This multi use article can be made by impregnating a sponge ball or block with about 20 grams of the cationic surfactants and any adjuncts therewith.In use, the cationic surfactant leaches out through the pores of the sponge into the wash liquor and reacts with the synthetic anionic surfactant. Such a filled sponge can be used to treat several loads of fabrics in conventional washing machines, and has the advantage that it can remain in the washer after use. Other devices and articles that can be adopted for use in dispensing the cationic surfactant in a washing liquor include those described in U.S. Patent 3,736,668,Dillarstone June 5, 1973 , U.S. Patent 3,701,202, Compa et al October 31, 1972 U.S. Patent 3,634,947, Furgal January 18, 1972 U.S. Patent 3,633,538, Hoeflin January 11, 1972 and U.S. Patent 3,435,537, Rumsey April 1, 1969 . A highly preferred product comprises the preferred cationic surfactants, as described hereinabove, impregnated on a flexible sheet so as to make it compatible with the movement of the fabrics in the washing machine and to facilitate its handling during manufacture of the product. Preferably the sheet is water pervious, i.e., water can pass from one surface of the sheet to the opposite surface and, for film type substrates, perforation of the sheet is desirable. The most preferred form of the substrate is a sheet of woven or nonwoven fabric or a thin sheet of cellular plastics material.Woven fabric sheets can take the form of a plain weave natural or synthetic fiber of low fiber count unit length, such as is used for surgical dressings, or of the type known as cheese cloth. t Loading limitations on sheet type substrates limit the amount of cationic surfactant that can be applied to the sheet namely to a maximum represented by a cationic surfactant substrate ratio of about 10 1. A very desirable attribute of the laundry additive products of the present invention is that they do not interfere with the mechanical operation of the washing machine into which they are put. A high proportion of domestic washing machines are of the rotating perforated drum type in which the perforations extend over the entire peripheral surface. In this type of equipment the drum construction and mode of operation obviates any problem of obstruction to liquid flow in the machine. Certain older types of machine utilize an agitator in a stationary vessel provided with a recirculating liquid system. In order to avoid liquid blockage in this machine type it may be necessary to provide slits or perforations in the substrate, particularly if it is in sheet form. Sheet structures of this type are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,944,694 and 3,956,556, McQueary March 16, 1976 and May 11, 1976, respectively . As stated above, suitable materials which can be used as a substrate in the invention herein include, among others, sponges, paper and woven and nonwoven fabrics A suitable sponge like material that can be used in the present invention comprises an absorbent foam like material in the form of a sheet. The term absorbent foam like material N is intended to encompass three dimensional absorptive materials such as gas blown foams , natural sponges and composite fibrous based structures such as are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,311,115 and 3,430,630.A particularly suitable material of this type is a hydrophilic polyurethane foam in which the internal cellular walls of the foam have been broken by reticutation. Foams of this type are described in detail in U.S. Patent 3,794,029, Dulle. A preferred example of this foam type comprises a hydro philic.polyurethane foam of density 0.596 grs per cubic inch with a cell count of between 8 and 40 cells per cm, preferably about 24 to 32 per cm available from theScott Paper Company, Eddystone, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.under the Registered Trade Mark Hydrofoam N. Preferred sheets of this type of material have thicknesses in the range from 3 to 5 mm. A suitable paper based absorbent structure containing 2 or 3 paper plies is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,414,459. The preferred substrates of the laundry additive products of the invention are apertured and nonapertured nonwoven fabrics which can generally be defined as adhesively bonded fibrous or filamentous products, having a web or carded fiber structure where the fiber strength is suitable to allow carding or comprising fibrous mats, in which the fibers or filaments are distributed haphazardly or in random array i.e., an array of fibers in a carded web wherein partial orientation of the fibers is frequently present as well as a completely haphazard distributional orientation or substantially aligned. The fibers or filaments can be natural e.g., wool, silk, wood pulp, jute, hemp, cotton, linen, sisal, or ramie , synthetic e.g., rayon, cellulose, ester, polyvinyl derivatives, polyolefins, polyamides, or polyesters or mixtures of any of the above. Methods of making nonwoven cloths are not a part of this invention and being well known in the art, are not described in detail herein. Generally, such cloths are made by air or water laying processes in which the fibers or filaments are first cut to desired lengths from long strands passed into a water or air stream, and then deposited onto a screen through which the fiber laden air or water is passed. The deposited fibers or filaments are then adhesively bonded together, dried, cured and otherwise treated as desired to form the nonwoven cloth. Nonwoven cloths made of polyesters, polyamides, vinyl resins, and other thermoplastic fibers can be bonded, i.e., the fibers are spun out onto a flat surface and bonded melted together by heat or by chemical reactions. The absorbent properties desired herein are particularly easy to obtain with nonwoven cloths and are provided merely by building up the thickness of the cloth, i.e., by super imposing a plurality of carded webs or mats to a thickness adequate to obtain the necessary absorbent properties, or by allowing a sufficient thickness of the fibers to deposit on the screen. Any diameter or denier of the fiber generally up to about 10 denier can be used, inasmuch as it is the free space between each fiber that makes the thickness of the cloth directly related to the absorbent capacity of the cloth, and which further makes the nonwoven cloth especially suitable for impregnation with a cationic surfactant by means of intersectional or capillary action. Thus, any thickness necessary to obtain the required absorbent capacity can be used. The choice of binder resins used in the manufacture of nonwoven cloths can provide substrates possessing a variety of desirable traits. For example, the absorbent capacity of the cloth can be increased, decreased, or regulated by respectively using a hydrophilic binderresin, a hydrophobic binder resin or a mixture thereof in the fiber bonding step. Moreover, the hydrophobic binder resin, when used singly or as the predominant compound of a hydrophobic hydrophilic mixture, provides nonwoven cloths which are especially useful as substrates when the cqtionic surfactant mixtures disclosed herein are used in an automatic washer. When the substrate herein is a nonwoven cloth made from fibers, deposited haphazardly or in a random array on the screen, the compositions exhibit excellent strength in all directions and are not prone to tear or separate when used in the washer. Preferably, the nonwoven cloth is water laid or air laid and is made from cellulosic fibers, particularly from regenerated cellulose or rayon, which are lubricated with standard textile lubricant. Preferably the fibers are from 4 to 50 mm in length and are from 1.5 to 5 denier Denier is an internationally recognized unit in yarn measure, corresponding to the weight in grams of a 9,000 meter length of yarn . Preferably the fibers are at least partially orientated haphazardly, particularly substantially haphazardly, and are adhesively bonded together with hydrophobic or substantially hydrophobic binder resin, particularly with a nonionic self crosslinking acrylic polymer or polymers.Conveniently, the cloth comprises 70 fiber and 308 binderresin polymer by weight and has a basis weight of from 10 to 100, preferably from 24 to 72 g mê. A suitable example is an air laid, nonwoven cloth comprising 70 regenerated cellulose American ViscoseCorporation and 30 hydrophobic binder resins RhoplexHA 8 on one side of the cloth, Rhoplex HA 16 on the other Rohm Haas, Inc. . The cloth has a thickness of 4 to 5 mils, a basis weight of 29 g m2. A 30 cm length of the cloth 21 cm wide weighs 1.78 grams. The fibers are .10 mm in length, 1.5 denier, and are orientated substantially haphazardly. The fibers are lubricated with sodium oleate. A further exemplary substrate is a water laid, nonwoven cloth commercially available from C. H. DexterCo., Inc. The fibers are regenerated cellulose, 15 mm in length, 1.5 denier, and are lubricated with a similar standard textile lubricant. The fibers comprise 70 of the nonwoven cloth by weight and are orientated substantially haphazardly the binder resin HA 8 comprises 30 by weight of the cloth. The substrate is 4 mils thick, and it has a basis weight of 29 g m2. A 30 cm length of the cloth 21 cm wide, weighs 1.66 grams. Apertured nonwoven substrates are also useful for the purposes of the present invention. The apertures, which extend between opposite surfaces of the substrate, are normally in a pattern and are formed during lay down of the fibers to produce the substrate. Exemplary apertured nonwoven substrated are disclosed in U.S.Patents 3,741,724, 3,930,086 and 3,750,237. A suitable diamond patterned apertured substrate is obtainable from Chicopee Manufacturing Co., Milltown,New Jersey, U.S.A. under the Code No. SK 650 WFX 577 and comprising a polyester wood pulp mixture having a basis weight of 50 g mê and approximately 13 apertures per square cm. Another preferred example of an apertured nonwoven substrate, also available from Chicopee ManufacturingCo., under the Code No. AK 30 ML 1379, comprises a regenerated cellulose sheet of 3.0 denier fibers bonded with Rhoplex RA 8 binder fiber binder ratio 70 30 having a basis weight of 40 g mê and 17 apertures cmê.A highly preferred square patterned apertured substrate of similar composition but fiber binder ratio of 80 20 and basis weight 35 g m2 is also available from ChicopeeBV Holland. In general, apertured fabrics for the purposes of the invention have from 10 20 apertures cm2, preferably 2 12 18 apertures cm The size and shape of the substrate sheet is a matter of choice and is determined principally by factors associated with the convenience of its use. Thus the sheet should not be so small as to become trapped in the crevices of the machine or the clothes being washed or so large as to be awkward to package and dispense from the contained in which it is sold. For the purposes of the present invention sheets ranging in plan 2 2 area from 130 cm to 1300 cm are acceptable, the pre ferred area lying in the range of from 520 cmê to 780 cmê.

Preferred optional ingredients include suds modifiers particularly those of suds suppressing types, exemplified by silicones, and silica silicone mixtures. U.S. Patents 3,933,672, issued January 20, 1976 toBartolotta et al, and 4,136,045, issued January 23, 1979 to Gault et al, incorporated herein by reference, disclose silicone suds controlling agents. The silicone material can be represented by alkylated polysiloxane materials such as silica aerogels and xerogels and hydrophobic silicas of various types. The silicone material can be described as siloxane having the formula EMI32.1 wherein x is from about 20 to about 2,000 and R and R are each alkyl or aryl groups, especially methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and phenyl. The polydimethylsiloxanes R and R1 are methyl having a molecular weight within the range of from about 200 to about 2,000,000, and higher, are all useful as suds controlling agents.Additional suitable silicone materials wherein the side chain groups R and R1 are alkyl, aryl, or mixed alkyl or aryl hydrocarbyl groups exhibit useful suds controlling properties. Examples of the like ingredients include diethyl , dipropyl , dibutyl , methyl , ethyl , phenylmethylpoly siloxanes and the like. Additional useful silicone suds controlling agents can be represented by a mixture of an alkylated siloxane, as referred to hereinbefore, and solid silica.Such mixtures are prepared by affixing the silicone to the surface of the solid sil ica. A preferred silicone suds controlling agent is represented by a hydrophobic silanated most preferably trimethylsilanated silica having a particle size in the range from about 10 millimicrons to 20 millimicrons and 2 a specific surface area above about 50 m gm. intimately admixed with dimethyl silicone fluid having a molecular weight in the range from about 500 to about 200,000 at a weight ratio of silicone to silanated silica of from about 19 1 to about 1 2. The silicone suds suppressing agent is advantageously releasably incorporated in a water soluble or water dispersible, substantially nonsurface active detergent impermeable carrier. Particularly useful suds suppressors are the selfemulsifying silicone suds suppressors, described in U.S.Patent 4,073,118, Gault et al, issued February 21, 1978, incorporated herein by reference. An example of such a compound is DB 544, commercially available from DowCorning, which is a siloxane glycol copolymer. Suds modifiers as described above are used at levels of up to approximately 2 , preferably from about 0.1 to about 1.5 by weight of the surfactant, Microcrystalline waxes having a melting point in the range from 350C 1150C and a saponification value of less than 100 represent additional examples of preferred suds control components for use in the subject compositions, and are described in detail in U.S. Patent 4,056,481, Tate, issued November 1, 1977, incorporated herein by reference. The microcrystalline waxes are substantially water insoluble, but are water dispersible in the presence of organic surfactants. Preferred microcrystalline waxes have a melting point from about 650C to 1000C, a molecular weight in the range from 400 1,000 and a penetration value of at least 6, measured at 770F by ASTM D1321.Suitable examples of the above waxes include microcrystalline and oxidized microcrystalline petroleum waxes Fischer Tropsch and oxidized Fischer Tropsch waxes ozokerite ceresin montan wax beeswax candelilla and carbauba wax. Alkyl phosphate esters represent an additional preferred suds control agent for. use herein. these preferred phosphate esters are predominantly monostearyl phosphate which, in addition thereto, can contain diand tristearyl phosphates and monooleyl phosphate, which can contain di and trioleyl phosphate. The alkyl phosphate esters frequently contain some trialkyl phosphate. Accordingly, a preferred phosphate ester can contain, in addition to the monoalkyl ester, e.g., monostearyl phosphate, up to about 50 mole percent of dialkyl phosphate and up to about 5 mole percent of trialkyl phosphate. Small amounts of zwitterionic and or ampholytic surfactants can be present, but because of the outstanding performance characteristics of the compositions within the present invention, surfactants additional to the essential components will not generally be necessary. The following examples are given to illustrate the parameters of and compositions within the invention. All of the percentages, parts and ratios are by weight unless otherwise stated. In Examples I and II, the performance was tested as follows 5 x5 swatches of standard textiles were soiled with various stains of the grease oil type. Each swatch was split in half and each half was washed in a different treatment. Since one swatch can only be used to compare two treatments, for, e.g., four treatments, there would be six swatches to make all possible comparisons, as follows. Swatch Number Treatment Comparison 1 AB 2 AC 3 AD 4 BC 5 BD 6 CD Laundry loads were prepared containing half swatches representing at least three and as many as six types of grease oil soil. The remainder of the loads were soiled laundry consisting of T shirts, dish towels, pillow cases and terry cloth bundles. The fabric load was 3 1 2 of the wash solution. Each load was then washed with a quantity of an individual composition that corresponds to detergent concentrations utilized in conventional automatic wash processes. The mini wash system with such a load simulates a conventional automatic washing process. The wash water had a temperature of 600F and contained 5 grains gallon water hardness. This wash process was repeated so that the number of replicates equals the number of treatments. Each of the half swatches was then comparison graded against its identical counterpart that had been washed with a different detergent composition to determine relative soil removal. A grading scale of 4 to 4 was used, with 4 indicating much less soil removal, 0 indicating no difference and 4 indicating much more soil removal. The treatment grades for each replicate are averaged across all greasy oily stain types and then the replicate averages are averaged to give a treatment mean for each detergent composition. This average is known as the Cleaning Index.
