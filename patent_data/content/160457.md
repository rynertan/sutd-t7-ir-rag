# Human factor VIII, Compositions containing it, methods and materials for use in it production.

## Abstract
The full DNA coding sequence of human factor VIII is identified herein. Also disclosed is the recombinant means useful to isolate and express this coding sequence in the preparation of functional human factor VIII polypeptide and functional derivatives thereof. Particularly preferred embodi ments provide proof of unequivocal identification and func tionality as well as specific, operable recombinant express ion vectors and cultures.
