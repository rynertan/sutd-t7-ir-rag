# Mixed fuels.

## Abstract
A mixed fuel comprising powdered coal, oil, water, and a dispersion stabilizer is described. The dispersion stabilizer comprises water insoluble fine particles having a colloid forming ability. More specifically, the stabilizer consists of 1 a water insoluble natural polymeric compound, 2 a water insoluble polymeric compound prepared by a chemical treatment or dissolution and regeneration of a natural polymeric compound, 3 a water insoluble synthetic polymeric compound, or 4 a water insoluble inorganic hydroxide or oxide, or graphite. This mixed fuel has good fluidity and storage stability.
