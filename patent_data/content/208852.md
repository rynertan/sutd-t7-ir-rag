## Description
The present invention relates to a data communication terminal device such as a facsimile or teletex machine. Prior art facsimile machine is classified into a class 1 machine which can send and receive only image data, a class 2 machine which can send and receive image data and only receive character code data, or a class 3 machine which can send and receive image data and character code data. The class 3 machine can efficiently transmit a document in which the character code data and the image data are mixedly contained. The class 3 machine mixed mode terminal cannot send the character code data to the class 1 machine. Further, the mixed mode terminal cannot send the image data to a teletex machine. From document EP 0 053 469 A2 a data communication apparatus is known comprising memory means for storing mixed data including image data and character code data in a page sending means for sending data to be transmitted, said sending means being capable of sending, as block data, data divided into blocks in accordance with type of data and control means for discriminating terminal characteristics of a called station and converting the data stored in said memory means on the basis of a result of discrimination performed by said control means wherein when said control means discriminates that the called station cannot receive character code data, said control means converts the character code data into image data, and causes said sending means to send the converted image data. Hence, if a called station is not capable of receiving mixed data a conversion of said data is necessary. Furthermore, if a transmission mode of a called station does not correspond to a desired transmission mode of the sending station a conversion of the data to be sent in accordance with an available transmission mode is necessary. That is, when a called station cannot receive character code data, the character code data is converted into image data and the converted image data is sent to the called station. However, as mentioned above there exist data communication devices which are not capable of receiving image data. It is an object of the present invention to provide a data communication device which overcomes the problems described above. It is another object of the present invention to provide a data communication device which can communicate with a station which can receive only a selected data. These objects are achieved by a data communication device according to the claim 1. In particular, when the called station cannot receive image data, character code data is automatically selected from data to be transmitted, and the selected data is sent to the called station while the output of image data is inhibited. Also, a message indicating that image data cannot be sent is issued. By means of these features, when the called station has no function of receiving image data, only character code data receivable by the called station is automatically selected and sent to the called station. Therefore, an operator does not have to carry out a troublesome re edition of data to be transmitted into data including only character code data, and important character information can be sent correctly and reliably. In addition, since it is inhibited to transmit image data, no transmission error occurs at the called station. Besides, since there is issued a message indicating that image data cannot be sent, the operator readily recognizes that fact. The present invention will now be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a block diagram of one embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the embodiment. A reader 10 reads a document to produce an electrical signal. A facsimile machine 20 comprises a reader printer interface 21, an image compression unit ICU 22, a program memory PMEM 23, a bit move unit BMU 24, an image memory IMEM 25, a video RAM VRAM 26, a central processing unit CPU 27, a communication interface 28, a bus 29 and a communication control unit CCU 30. The ICU compresses and decompresses data. In order to raise an encoding rate, a two dimensional compression high compression is used. The PMEM 23 includes an OS program area and an application program area for controlling input output devices on a periphery of the facsimile machine 20 and units in the facsimile machine, and a font memory area for converting character code data to image bit data. It also includes an area for storing and editing text code data character data by key entry or word processing. The PMEM 23 has a memory management unit MMEU and a work area which serves as a buffer for transmission data for transmitting data from a hard disk 50 through the CCU 30 and writing data from the CCU 30 to the hard disk 50. The buffer is used for velocity adjustment between the disk and the line. The BMU 24 processes data bit by bit in the CRT 60 to edit an image image processing such as enlarging, reducing, rotating, moving or extracting of the image. the IMEM 25 has a 4M bytes capacity to store the image data from the reader, the image data edited by the BMU 24, the data decompressed by the ICU 22 and the image bit data for example, one bit per pixel of the key entered character data, wordprocessed text code data, mixed data or character code data. The mixed data contains the image bit data and the character code data in one page. Each block is called image block or character block. Each block has each identification code and is managed and stored. The IMEM 25 may also be used as a buffer which temporarily store data for adjusting velocity between the reader 10, printer 70 and the line 40. The VRAM 26 stores the image data to be displayed on the CRT 60 in a form of bit map data for example, one bit per pixel . The hard disk device 50 and the floppy disk device 51 are provided as external storages. Those devices are non volatile memories. A backup memory may be used as the non volatile memory. The transmission data and the received data are stored therein. The keyboard 61 enters transmission reception command data, image word process command data and character data for word processing. The pointing device 62 such as a mouse moves a cursor position on the CRT 60 to select an image position to be edited. The pointing device 62 also divides the mixed data into blocks. The block coordinates are stored in the PMEM 23 and used as one of identification code data header during the transmission. The line 40 is preferably a digital line of 64K bits sec of a digital data switching network or digital data packet network for transmitting high resolution density and large information quantity image data at a high speed. The printer 70 is a laser beam printer which prints at a speed of 3Mbps. In Fig. 7, one page of mixed data is divided into blocks 1 4. The one page of data corresponds to one screen on the CRT 60, one page of transmission data and one page of print sheet for the received data. A plurality of such page data are prepared and stored in the hard disk 50, and they are parallelly transmitted. In a transmission format of the mixed data shown in Fig. 12, structure data headers 1 n are added before the block data 1 n. The header indicates whether the succeeding block data is image data or character data, a size data quantity of the block data and a position on the page. Symbol A denotes a transmission reception acknowledgement signal for the block data after the transmission of one page of data, EOP is sent. The one page of data from the reader 10 is stored in the image memory 25, transferred to the VRAM 26 and displayed on the CRT 60. The image is trimmed through the BMU 24 by command from the keyboard 61 or the pointing device 62 so that only the image corresponding to the block 3 is left, which is then stored in the memory 25. The text code data from the key 61 is stored in the memory 23, bit converted, transferred to the VRAM 26 and displayed on the CRT 60. The data is edited in the same manner as the image processing so that text characters corresponding to the blocks 1, 2 and 4 are left, which are then stored in the memory 23. The data stored in the memory 23 are codes. The position data corresponding to the respective blocks and the data types are managed by the memory 23. Upon the next command, the image data and the position data of the block 3 in the memory 25 are read out and displayed on the CRT 60 at the position of the block 3 through the VRAM 26. Thus, the blocks 1 4 of Fig. 7 are finally displayed. The mixed data are read from the memories 23 and 25 in the sequence of blocks 1 4 and sequentially stored in the disk 50. The transmission operation is now explained. The document is read by the reader 10 and the image data is stored in the IMEM 25 through the reader printer interface 21 and stored in the hard disk. In the transmission operation, the image data is compressed to an MMR code by the ICU 22 and it is stored in the disk. The data stored in the hard disk is temporarily stored in the PMEM 23 from which it is sent to a destination station through the CCU 30 and the line 40. In order to edit the data stored in the hard disk 50, the data is read into the IMEM 25, decompressed by the ICU 22 and the image enlargement reduction and movement are carried out by the BMU 24. If characters are to be entered during the edition, the characters are entered from the keyboard 61, converted to character data by the PMEM 23, and they or the character data stored in the hard disk are stored in the character block of the image edited by the BMU 24. In order to transmit the edited data, it is stored in the hard disk 50, written into the PMEM 23 and then read therefrom and sent to a destination station through the CCU 30 and the line 40. The data of Fig. 7 edited on the CRT 60 is transmitted in a similar manner. In order to print out the edited data, it is written into the IMEM 25 and then read therefrom and developed into the image dot data, which is sent to the printer 70 through the reader printer interface 28. In order to display the edited data on the CRT 60, it is written into the VRAM 26 and then read therefrom and sent to the CRT 60. The operation of the present embodiment is explained. Fig. 3 shows a flow chart of the transmission operation in the present embodiment. The flow chart operation is executed by the CPU 27 in accordance with a program stored in the PMEM 23. A negotiation protocol data communication with a destination station is started S1 to determine whether the communication with the destination station is allowed or not S2 . If it is allowed, one block of the transmission data is sent out from the hard disk 50 through the memory 23 and the CCU 30 S3 . Reception of an acknowledgement signal for the one block from the destination station is checked S4 . Prior to the step S1, the binary image data or mixed data from the reader 10 is stored in the hard disk 50 for transmission. If the acknowledgement signal is detected, whether the next block to be transmitted is left or not is checked S5 . If it is left, the process returns to the step S3 and the above operation is repeated until the last block is transmitted S6 . If the acknowledgement signal is not received from the destination station after the transmission of one block S3 , the data of the block corresponding to the unreceived acknowledgement signal is sent from the hard disk 50 S7 . That is, the data of that block is retransmitted. Thus, the reliability of the transmission data is improved. In the step S3, if the communication with the destination station is not allowed by a trouble such as line break or mismatching of communication mode, an error is displayed S8 and the transmission operation is terminated S6 . Fig. 4 shows a flow chart of modification of the transmission operation shown in Fig. 3. Let us assume that the transmitting station is the mixed mode terminal device. In the mixed mode, the pixel data MMR code data of the image and the character data ASCII code data can be transmitted and received, and the text including the characters and the images in one page can be efficiently transmitted. The like steps to those shown in Fig. 3 are designated by the like step numbers. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 4, the transmission data is converted to a signal format which can be received by the destination station before it is transmitted. After the negotiation has been started S1 , whether the destination station is a class 1 station which can transmit and receive only the image data or not by the protocol data S21 . If it is the class 1 station, the character code data is converted to the image data by the PMEM 23, the image data is compressed by the ICU 22 S25 , and it is transmitted one page at a time for each block S3 . The conversion is carried out by a character generator in the PMEM 23 which produces bit pattern signal corresponding to the character data. The steps after the step S3 are identical to those in Fig. 3. If the destination station is not the class 1 station, whether the destination station is class 2 station which can transmit and receive the image data and can only receive the character data and the mixed data or a class 3 station which can transmit and receive the image data and the character data and transmits the data in the mixed mode in which a document containing characters and images in one page can be efficiently transmitted is checked S22, S23 . If it is the class 2 or 3 station, the process goes to the step S3 where the data is transmitted block by block. If the destination station is none of the classes 1 to 3, whether the destination station is a teletex station word processing communication terminal or not S24 . If it is the teletex station, the sending station sends an ASCII code message stating that it does not send the image S26 and then it sends only the character data block S27 . The character data are sent one page per block. The teletex station can display the block of text on the screen of the CRT 60 and also display the above message. Thus, a plurality of blocks are printed on the plurality of pages. In the class 2, 3 terminals, one page of data sent in a plurality of blocks are edited to display or print them on one page. In the class 1 terminal and the teletex terminal, the block edition cannot be carried out and each block is printed on one page. An embodiment in which a plurality of blocks are printed on one page will be explained later. In this manner, the mixed mode terminal device can communicate with the destination station which can transmit and receive only the image data, and can communicate with the teletex station. When it communicates with the teletex station, it sends the message stating that it does not send the image data. Thus, the destination station does not determine that an error has occurred even if it does not receive the image data. In the embodiment of Fig. 4, when the destination station is the teletex station, the message stating that the image data is not sent may be sent after the transmission of the character data or during the transmission of the character data . In the embodiments of Figs. 3 and 4, the reception of the acknowledgement signal is checked for each block. Alternatively, the reception of the acknowledgement signal may be checked for each window which comprises a plurality of blocks or for each page of the document. Only error pages or error blocks may be retransmitted after a plurality of pages of documents have been transmitted. The reception operation is now explained. The received data is written into the PMEM 23 through the line 40, CPU 30 and communication interface, and it is read from the PMEM 23 and stored in the hard disk 50. Since the hard disk cannot be taken out by the user and the contents thereof are not destroyed when the power supply is turned off, a reliability for storing the received data is high. The blocks 1, 2 and 4 are stored in the ASCII code and the block 3 is stored in the MMR code. The reception header is managed by the PMEM 23 so that the blocks can be edited on the CRT 60 or the IMEM 25. Fig. 5 shows a flow chart of the receiving operation in the above embodiment. Negotiation is started S51 to check whether the communication with the transmitting station is allowed or not S52 . If it is allowed, the reception mark and the terminal number and the communication class of the transmitting station are displayed on the CRT 60 S53 . The reception mark is displayed when the transmitting station is identified. The reception mark is displayed during the edit operation at a bottom of the screen of the CRT 60 so that it does not disturb the edit operation, and the reception mark is blinked. If a call signal is received during the mixed edition operation of the character image and the reader image by using the BMU 24, IMEM 25, CRT 60, keyboard 61 and pointing device 62, the CPU 60 stores the received mixed data from the CCU 30 in the hard disk through the PMEM 23 by interruption and multi task function without interrupting the mixed edition operation. After one block of data have been received S54 , they are stored in the hard disk. After the storage of one block of data has been confirmed S55 , the acknowledgement signal which indicates that one block of data have been received is sent to the transmitting station S56 . Whether the next block is left or not is checked S57 , and if it is left, the storing in the hard disk and the transmission of the acknowledgement signal are repeated. On the other hand, if the communication with the transmitting station is not allowed, an error is displayed S58 . In this manner, the received data are stored in the hard disk one block at a time and then the acknowledgement signal is sent. Accordingly, the reliability of the received data is high. Instead of sending the acknowledgement signal for each block, it may be sent for each window, each document or every plurality of documents. Namely, one page of data has been received S54 , the storage of one page of data to the disk 51 has been confirmed by the determination of EOP S55 or the like, the acknowledgement signal which indicates that one page of data has been received is sent to the transmitting station S56 , whether the next page is to be sent or not is checked by communication data protocol with the transmitting station and reception for each page of data is repeated S57 . When command signal which indicates the completion of the transmission of document of a plurality of pages of data has been received, all the reception operations are stopped. Fig. 6 is a block diagram of other embodiment of the present invention. The like elements to those shown in Fig. 1 are designated by the like numerals. In the present embodiment, a CCU 30a is provided in addition to a facsimile machine 20a to control a power supply 35 of the facsimile machine 20a. The CCU 30a comprises a memory 31 for temporarily storing the received data and a battery 32 for preventing momentary power off. A power supply 33 is a main power supply and the power supply 35 is a power control unit for the facsimile machine 20a. When an auto reception mode is not selected, a switch 34 is thrown to the right the opposite position to that shown in Fig. 6 . The operation in this case is essentially same as that described in connection with Fig. 1. In the auto reception mode, the switch 34 is thrown to the left as shown in Fig. 6. In this case, since the CPU 30a does not supply the power to the facsimile machine 20a, the hard disk drive 50 stops and the image does not appear on the CRT 60. Thus, energy can be saved particularly in night time when the data is not received. Since the hard disk drive 50 stops during the non reception period, the lifetime of the hard disk and the floppy disk is extended. When a call signal is received from the transmitting station, the predetermined negotiation is carried out for a short time and then a timer is started and the memory 31 stores the received data. On the other hand, upon reception of the call signal, the power is supplied from the power supply 35 to the elements of the facsimile machine 20 and the peripheral devices. After the hard disk 50 has become ready to store, the received data stored in the memory 31 is sent to and stored in the hard disk 50 as the timer is counted out. A reception mark is displayed on the screen of the CRT 60. Thus, the reception of data is not delayed until the hard disk becomes ready, and a line utilization efficiency is improved. The operation when the data is sent from the mixed mode terminal device to the teletex or class 1 terminal device is now explained. When the data is to be sent to the teletex terminal which receives the ASCII code and converts it to the character image, only the character codes are sent or the character codes and the message codes for the image blocks are sent. The information from the mixed mode terminal is image information in its entire page, character information in its entire page or mixed information thereof. The mixed information is divided into a plurality of blocks in one page, and the blocks comprise at least one character information block and at least one image information block Fig. 7 . When the image signal is to be sent to the teletex terminal, the block or page which contains the image information is erased and the erasure is informed to an operator. If the operator requests a message for the erased image information, the message in a form of character is displayed in the block or page of the erased image information. Finally, the text which consists of only character information in one page without being blocked is transmitted. If the message is not required, the image area is transmitted as a blank. Fig. 8 shows a flow chart of the transmission of data from the mixed mode terminal device to the teletex terminal device. After the text edition T1 , whether one page of edited information on the CRT screen has a plurality of blocks for the mixed mode or not is checked T2 . If it has the plurality of blocks, whether the first block includes the image information or not is checked T3, T4 . The decision is made based on the identification code for each block management data in the memory 23 added during the mixed edition. If it is the image information, whether the image information is to be erased or not is displayed on the CRT 60 T5 , and a command by the operator is monitored. If the erase command is entered, a command from the operator is monitored to determine whether an alternate message is to be sent or not T6 . If the command to send the message is entered, a key data next entered is set to the message character T7 and the image data block information is converted to the message information T8 . The block information may be either erased from the CRT screen or held. The above operation is repeated for the remaining blocks T9, T10 . On the other hand, if the block includes the image character information, it is not erased but held on the CRT 60. If the erasure of the image data is not desired, communication not allowed is displayed T11 , and if the transmission of the alternate message is not desired, the image data block is left blank T12 . After all blocks have been checked, boundaries of the blocks are deleted and the blocks are edited into one page of character information T13 , because the teletex terminal transmits and receives not block by block but page by page. The deletion of the boundaries corresponds to preparation of one page of code data map by scanning the block by block code data developed on the main memory 23 one page at a time from an initial address to the last address. As a result, the header for each block is deleted and an identification header C for one page is newly set Fig. 12 . In the step T2, if the plurality of steps are not detected, and if the image data is included T15 , whether the alternate message is necessary or not is checked T16 , and if it is necessary, the message character is entered T17 . If the image data is not included or if the image data is included but the alternate message is not necessary, the process is terminated. Fig. 9 shows a flow chart of the signal transmission from the mixed mode terminal device to the class 1 terminal device. The process is basically same as that shown in the flow chart of Fig. 8. The first three steps U1 U3 are identical to those of Fig. 8. The image data is stored in the IMEM 25 so that it is sent as it is, and the character data is converted to the image data through the memory 23 and then it is stored in the IMEM 25 U4, U5 . The above operation is repeated for each of the blocks U6, U7 . Graphic code data is converted to image data for each block and it is stored in the IMEM 25. Then, the block boundaries are deleted and the data are converted to one page of image information U8 so that one page of bit data map can be prepared by scanning the pixel data for each block developed on the memory 25 from the initial address to the last address. The header for each block is thus deleted and the header I for one page is newly set Fig 12 . The data is sent to the class 1 terminal device U9 . If the plurality of blocks are not included, the page transmission is effected in the manner shown in Fig. 8 U10, U11 . The density conversion is now explained. The resolution of the reader 10 and the printer 70 is as high as 16 pels mm. The data in the facsimile machine 20 is compatible to 16 pels mm. Accordingly, in a local mode in which the data read by the reader 10 is simply copied by the printer 70, the data resolution remains 16 pels mm. However, the destination station may be a terminal which can process data at 8 pels mm. In this case the data is converted to 8 pels mm data in the transmission station so that the information quantity is less than that when the data is density converted in the receiving station, and the transmission time is shorter. Fig. 10 shows a flow chart of the density conversion in the mixed mode. The text is edited on the CRT 60 VI , and whether one page of edited information has a plurality of blocks as shown in Fig. 7 or not is checked V2 . When the one page of read data includes the image pixel data from the reader 10 and the character code data from the keyboard mixed data , the plurality of blocks are included. Accordingly, the first block is checked V3 , and whether it is the image data or the character data is checked in the same manner as Fig. 8 V4 . In the step V2, the one page of data to be checked may be the edited text data transferred from the hard disk to the IMEM 25. If it is the image data, whether the destination station is the 8 pels mm terminal or the 16 pels mm terminal V5 . It is determined based on the terminal number of the destination station entered by the operator through the keyboard. More specifically, a table map memory of the terminal numbers and the density data 8 pels mm data, 16 pels mm data is prepared and it is scanned to determine whether the terminal is 8 pels mm or 16 pels mm. The table map is preregistered in the ROM of the PMEM 23 as shown in Fig. 11. If the transmission is to be done at 8 pels mm, the density is reduced to one half thinning of pixels by the BMU 24 and the IMEM 25 and is stored in the disk 50 V6 . If the transmission is to be done at 16 pels mm, no density conversion is made. The data may be converted to a density other than 8 pels mm. In this case, the BMU 24 carries out a predetermined calculation to convert to the other density. Then, the second block is checked V7 and the above operation is repeated. If the block includes the character code data instead of the image data, the density conversion is not performed, because it is advisable to transmit the text information in the form of code data such as originally edited ASCII code than to convert the character code data to the image pixel data and then density convert it. However, when the mixed data is to be transmitted to the class 1 terminal as shown in Fig. 9, the character code is converted to the image pixel data and then it is density converted. Since 8 pels are sufficient for the character image, 8 pel data may be sent without regard to the type of the destination station. After all blocks have been checked V8 , whether a transmission command has been issued or not is checked V9 , and if it has been issued, the transmission is started V10 . Thus, when the transmitting station processes the high density data and the destination station processes the low density data, the information quantity transmitted is reduced and the transmission time is shortened. If all blocks have been checked in the step V8, the data to be transmitted have already been stored in the IMEM 25 or the hard disk 50 and the necessary density conversion has been performed, but the transmission has not yet been initiated. Thus, the density conversion is completed before the transmission. Accordingly, the density conversion time is not included in the transmission time and the transmission time is further shortened. The density conversion prior to the transmission is attained by detecting the density of the destination station prior to the transmission by referring the table map shown in Fig. 11. If the registration of the destination station is not found in the table, the density of the destination station can be detected during the communication negotiation protocol dialogue with the destination station, and the density conversion is performed after the line has been connected. In this case, the line is kept waiting for the density conversion time. In the step V2, if the edited text does not have the plurality of blocks, whether all data in the IMEM 25 are image data or not is checked V11 , and if they are image data, they are density converted, and if they are character code data, they are transmitted without density conversion V12, V13 . If the destination station which received the character code data has a character generator in the font memory compatible to the resolution of the printer at the receiving station, the character pattern image of the corresponding resolution is generated in accordance with the codes transmitted. The same is applicable to the above flow chart in which the character codes are substituted by graphic codes vector codes . In the above flow chart, the last data to be transmitted is read from the hard disk. Accordingly, the image pixel data in the mixed data to which the density conversion and the message addition have been carried out is compressed by the ICU 22, and it is stored in the hard disk through the IMEM 25. The image blocks and the character blocks to be transmitted from the hard disk have headers identification codes added before the data by the memory 23, and they are transmitted through the CPU 30 or 30a. Fig. 13 shows a control flow chart for printing or displaying the received data. When an entry from a print key is detected w1 , whether the disk 50 includes a plurality of blocks of data or not is checked, and a type of the data of the first block is checked w2, w3 . This is determined based on the data of the reception header stored in the management area of the disk 50 . If it is the character code data, the data of the first block is transferred to the PMEM 23, the ASCII code is converted to the image bit data, and it is transferred to the IMEM 25 at the position determined by the header data w4, w5 . If it is the image data, it is transferred to the ICU 22 where it is decompressed and converted from the MMR code to the bit data, and it is transferred to the IMEM 25 at the position determined by the header w6, w7 . After the conversion for all of the blocks, the data in the IMEM 25 are supplied to the printer 70 w8, w9 . In this manner, one page of mixed data can be printed out in one page of sheet. When the data are to be displayed on the CRT 60, the data are transferred from the IMEM 25 to the VRAM 26. After input of transmission command, whether the type of the receiving station is class 1 or not is checked by the protocol data X1 , when the type of the receiving station is class 1, the first block data of one page is read form the disk 50 X2 and the data is converted to a bit pattern data X3 , and then the bit pattern data is set to a designated position in ITEM 25 X4 . Whether there is next block in one page or not is checked by control data in the disk 51 X5 , if the next block is there, the block is read from the disk 50 X6 and is converted to a bit pattern data, and the bit pattern data is set to another position in the ITME 25. The above steps are repeated and block composition is attained and one page of data is formed and stored in memory X4 . If no, one page of data in the memory 25 is compressed, converted and then transmitted as MMR encoded data by ICU 22, or the MMR encoded data of one page is stored in the disk 50 and is transmitted from the disk 51 X7 . Reception of an acknowledgement signal form the destination station is checked X8 . If the acknowledgement signal is detected, whether next page data to be sent is left in the disk 51 or not is checked by control data X9 . If it is left, as mentioned above, each block data of the next page is sequentially read and is converted to a bit pattern data. Then, it is combined into one page of data and is transmitted. The above procedure cycle is repeated until no data to be sent is left in the disk 50. If the acknowledgement signal of the reception is not detected, each block data of the present one page is sequentially read again from the disk 50 X11 , and is converted to a bit pattern data . Then it is combined into one page of data and is transmitted. Whether the type of the destination station is a teletex station or not is checked X11 . If it is the teletex, each block of one page is sequentially read from the disk 50 as well as the case of the class 1 of the teletex station. However, whether the read block data is character code data or not is checked by control data X13 . Only if it is the character code, the code is arranged at a predetermined position in the memory 23. By combination of each character block, one page is formed in the memory 23 X14 . In a similar manner as mentioned above, after one page formation, the transmission of the one page data X16 and reception acknowledgement check X17 for each page are repeated. Further, in advance a message stating that image data cannot be sent has been transmitted X15 . Whether the receiving station is the class 3 station or not is checked X18 , if it is the class 3 station, the first block of one page is read from the disk 50 and it is sent to the CCU 30 and the block data is transmitted X19 .
