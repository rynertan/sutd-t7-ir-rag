# INJECTION OR TRANSFER MOULDING

## Abstract
An injection method for moulding denture plates uses a mould formed of a pair of stones with embedded replica teeth the stones being formed themselves in a chamber defined between a pair of relatively good thermally conduc tive 5, 6 spaced apart by a body 1, 2 of relatively lower thermal conductivity, the body having a neck 13, 14 which carries an injection cylinder housing 17 , the method including initial polymerisation of pressure injected mixture of polymer and monomer at a controlled temperature sufficient only to cause orderly polymerisation without appreciable exothermal effects.
