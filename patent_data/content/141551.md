# Titanate powder and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
A powder consisting of barium titanate powder, stron tium titanate powder or a solid solution thereof, character ized in that a its average particle diameter is 0.07 to 0.5 µ, b its specific surface area measured is 20 m² g or less and does not exceed 2.5 times the specific surface area calculated from the average particle diameter on the assumption that the powder particles are spherical, c its crystallite diameter calculated from the half width of the peak of the X ray diffraction pattern for the powder is 0.05 µ or more, and d its shape is substantially spherical. Said powder can be produced by reacting hydrous titanium oxide with barium hydroxide and or strontium hydroxide at a temperature ranging from 60 C to less than 110 C in the presence of 120 to 2,000 moles of water per mole of titanium.
