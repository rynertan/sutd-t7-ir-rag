# Production of improved antimony containing catalysts, catalysts so produced and use thereof.

## Abstract
Antimony based oxide complex catalysts are improved by adding to these catalysts an antimony containing com pound such as Sb₂O₃, in an amount of 0.1 to 25 based on an atomic basis of the antimony relative to the antimony al ready present in the catalyst. In this way a catalyst is pro duced which gives improved yields for example in the procuction of acrylonitrile by the ammoxidation of pro pylene.
