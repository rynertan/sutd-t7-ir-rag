## Description
Title Fermented milk product containing lactic acid bacteria, and process for the preparation thereof Applicant designates as inventor lI.L.M. LelieveldThe present invention relates to a fermented milk product that contains lactic acid bacteria and to a process for the preparation thereof. Examples of fermented milk products are fermented milk, which can both be consumed as such and can be used as aqueous phase in the preparation of margarine, as well as yoghurt, quark, sour cream and buttermilk. The invention relates in particular to yoghurt and the preparation thereof.In the preparation of yoghurt it is usual to add a yoghurt culture to whole milk, skim milk or milk with a decreased content of fat and to acidify the milk at a temperature of approximately 40 45 C. Mostly a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus is used. It is also possible to carry out the fermentation at a lower temperature, for example room temperature, i.e. at 150 250C. In order to increase the viscosity of the yoghurt, it is usual to increase the dry matter content of the starting milk by addition of whole or skim milk powder or by evaporation.Another possibility of making the yoghurt thicker is the use of stabilizers, which are mostly natural polysaccharides or derivatives thereof.It has now been found that an increase in the viscosity of yoghurt can be obtained through special conditions. This has the advantage that from a certain starting mlk composition a thicker product can be obtained than with the usual process. On the other hand, a product with the usual viscosity and consistency can be prepared by applying the new process to a starting product with a dry matter content less high than usual and or a content of stabilizers less than usual, as a result of which a raw material saving is obtained.These special conditions consist, on the one hand, of the selection of certain cultures and, on the other hand of the selection of agitation of the milk product during the fermentation.It was found, namely, that under certain conditions the chains of lactic adid bacteria are disrupted to shorter chains and or single cells, which often remain connected with each other by threads. It is assumed that these threads are built up from biopolymers. In this connection polysaccharides or proteins spring to mind. The network formed in this way possibly contributes to the structure of the fermented milk product, causing this to have a higher viscosity than a conventional product in which said threads are not present.Although the experimental results were found in first instance during the preparation of yoghurt, these are also applicable to other fermented milk products with a relatively high viscosity, such as quark, sour cream, pudding and suchlike.The invention provides a fermented milk product that contains lactic acid bacteria, which occur in chains having an average chain length in the range of 1 to 5 lactic acid bacteria, which lactic acid bacteria can form biopolymers. In particular, at least part of the chains are connected with each other by threads of biopolymers, which threads preferably have a thickness of 40 to 300 nm, particularly of 70 to 200 nm.Although the invention is embodied by the various kinds of products mentioned in the foregoing, the preferred embodiment is yoghurt, both stirred yoghurt and stand yoghurt, the latter being most preferred. To elucidate by stirred yoghurt is meant a yoghurt that is packaged after the proteins have already coagulated, while by stand yoghurt is meant a yoghurt with which the coagulation of the proteins occurs in the package and thus the yoghurt structure develops in the package.At the same time, the invention provides a process for the preparation of such a fermented milk product, which is characterized in that i a starting milk is inoculated with a culture of lactic acid bacteria which can form biopolymers, ii the inoculated milk is allowed to acidify until the pH has been decreased to a value not lower than 5.3, without coagulation occurring, iii the partly acidified but not yet coagulated milk is agitated in such a way that the chains of lactic acid bacteria are disrupted to shorter chains and or single cells, during which threads are formed which connect the shorter chains and or cells with each other, iv the milk treated according to iii , if desired to gether with other ingredients such as cream, fruit preparations or not yet fermented milk, is filled into containers, and possibly v the acidification of the milk product is allowed to continue in the containers, whereby the milk coagulates and a fermented, coagulated milk product is formed.In the case of the fermented product to be prepared being a yoghurt, preferably a yoghurt culture is applied. Depending on the required structure of the final product, the starting material is milk having a dry matter content of 1020 by weight. This dry matter content, which is increased with respect to that of normal milk, can be obtained by a evaporation, b concentration with the aid of membrane filtration or c the addition of skim milk powder, whole milk powder, whey powder, casein or caseinate, whey proteins or concentrates of milk proteins, to whole milk, skim milk or milk having a decreased fat content.A suitable embodiment is a process in which measures ii and iii are carried out simultaneously with the aid of continuous fermentation. Preferred is a continuous fermentation method in which, during the fermentation at a constant pH, the contents of the fermenting vessel are stirred in such a way that, as a result, the chains of cells are already disrupted. The thread formation can be influenced by fixing a certain speed of stirring, and geometry of the stirrer and the wall of the vessel. The process so described is particularly suitable for the preparation of a stand yoghurt. However, a stirred yoghurt can also be prepared with favourable results.In this case the indicated process should be modified in such a way that the product obtained after measures i , ii and iii is subjected to further acidification, whereby the milk proteins coagulate before the milk product, possibly together with other ingredients, such as cream, fruit or fruit preparations or not yet fermented milk, is filled into containers.A number of the measures are already known for the preparation of yoghurt. With this being borne in mind, the process for the preparation of stand yoghurt or of stirred yoghurt according to the invention can be indicated as follows.A process for the preparation of stand yoghurt according to the invention, in which a milk is inoculated with a culture of lactic acid bacteria, b the inoculated milk, possibly after being partly fer mented, is packaged in containers, c the packaged milk is allowed to ferment at a temperature in the range of 15 50 C an thereafter cooled to a tem erature below 10 C, which is characterized in that the inoculated milk is allowed to ferment, preferably continuously, until the pH has dropped to a value not smaller than 5.3 during which several bacteria divisions have taken place and biopolymers have already been formed and during this fermentation, but at the latest when said pH has been reached, the partly fermented milk is agitated in such a way that the chains of lactic acid bacteria are disrupted to shorter chains and or single cells, whereby threads are formed which connect the shorter chains and or the single cells with each other.A process for the preparation of a stirred yoghurt according to the invention, in which a milk is inoculated with a culture of lactic acid bacteria, b the inoculated milk is allowed to ferment at a temper ature in the range of 15 50 C until the milk coagulates, c the fermented and coagulated milk, possibly after cooling to below 10 C, is packaged in containers, which is characterized in that the inoculated milk is allowed to ferment, preferably continuously, until the pH has dropped to a value not smaller than 5.3 during which several bacteria divisions have taken place and biopolymers have already been formed and during this fermentation, but at the latest when said pH has been reached, the partly fermented milk is agitated in such a way that the chains of lactic acid bacteria are disrupted to shorter chains and or single cells, whereby threads are formed which connect the shorter chains and or the single cells with each other, whereafter the milk treated in this manner is allowed to ferment further until coagulation has occurred.The previously mentioned threads of biopolymers should not be confused with the slime threads which are easily visible macroscopically or with the aid of a normal light microscope with a multiplication factor of less than 300, which are present in thread drawing acidified milk products, such as described by A.J. Kluyver in Ned. Tijdschrift Hyg. Microbiol.Serologie 3 1929 301 307. These easily visible slime threads consist of macromolecules present in the product which, although they are formed under the influence of the lactic acid bacteria, have nothing to do with the lactic acid bacteria being connected with each other. This known slimeforming also acts to increase viscosity, but this increased viscosity is very quickly decreased by mechanical treatment such as shaking and stirring.The threads meant in this patent application are not visible under a normal light microscope and can only be made clearly visible with the aid of a scanning electronic microscope SEM , for which samples of acidified milk, treated as indicated in the aforegoing in the description of the process according to the invention, are prepared as will be described hereinafter. In samples of acidified milk which are not mechanically treated according to the invention, no threads could be found which are visible with an SEM. This also applied to examined yoghurt products which are commercially available.Naturally, organisms should be used which are capable of forming sufficient threads. Suitable organisms can be selected with the following methods. The first selection criterion is to start from microorganisms which grow in chains and, during the growth in milk, produce a integument around their cell wall. Whether microorganisms can meet this selection criterion can be ascertained with the aid of a normal light or optical microscope.Whether the second selection criterion is met, i.e. whether threads really develop, can be determined with the aid of anSEM, with which a sample prepared on laboratory scale is examined, which sample has been obtained during the acidification by stirring, under suitable conditions, a small amount of milk inoculated with the microorganisms.The samples were made suitable for observation with the SEM according to a procedure indicated by Kalab and Harwalkar Journal of Dairy Science 56 1973 835 842 . Small amounts of yoghurt are fixed in a 1.5 glutaraldehyde solution for 1 hour at room temperature and cut into sections. After the fixation, the gel sections are washed with distilled water.Herewith the water soluble substances are removed, particularly lactose, which would otherwise interfere with the observation of the relevant microstructure. The excess water is removed with filter paper and the specimens are quickly frozen in melting nitrogen nitrogen slush . Thereafter the specimens are freeze dried, whereby a rise in temperature to above 70 C before they are dry is avoided. The specimens are attached with a conductive adhesive on to a metal specimen holder and covered with a gold platinum layer about 50 nm thick. Photos in a magnification varying from 2000 to 5000 x were taken with an SEM with the aid of a secondary electronic picture.The differences between the yoghurts prepared according to the invention and according to the normal processes can be further elucidated with Figure 1 and with Photos A. and B. From the photos it appears that the threads discussed in the foregoing, which develop in products according to the invention, have a thickness of about 0.1 0.2 micron or about 100 200 nm. However, threads having a larger or smaller thickness have been found.The speed at which the shear forces become so great that the biopolymer threads break, or remain so small that the bacteria are not separated from each other, depends partly on the culture used. It can, however, be determined in a relatively easy though laborious manner through a few tests in which the samples are examined with the aid of an SEM.The invention will be explained with the following example.ExampleAs inoculation culture, a mixture of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus was used of which it had been determined beforehand that, under the conditions of use, this was capable of being drawn to threads. 1E of the culture, fully ripened in stationary pasteurised milk at 43 C, was inoculated into milk having a fat content of 1t to which 1 of skim milk powder had been added The fermentation took place at 43 2 C in a reactor provided with a stirrer and having the following dimensions.EMI8.1 The stirring speed was 300 revolutions per minute tip speed 3.8 m s . The stirring was stopped when a pH of 5.5 had been reached.The cell density was then about 50 of the final concentration.Thereafter the fermented milk was conveyed to containers which were kept at about 43 C for completion of the yoghurt formation 1.5 h . With the aid of an SEM, photos were taken of this yoghurt, of which Photo B is an example.
