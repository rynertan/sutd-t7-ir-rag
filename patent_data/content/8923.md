# Fuel injection system and air fuel ratio regulator therefor.

## Abstract
An air fuel ratio regulator for control of the movement of a fuel flow control lever on a fuel injection pump com prises a lever 54 connected to the pump control lever and moved by an aneroid 58 to change the fuel fow as a func tion of engine manifold vacuum changes to maintain a con stant air fuel ratio to the mixture charge. A fuel enrichment lever 60 moves to modify the movement of the lever 54 to compensate for changes in intake manifold gas temperature as sensed by a coil thermostat 114 , to maintain the constant air fuel ratio. A fuel enrichment shaft 120 having a piston 128 is connected to the lever 60 and to a number of spaced, interconnected but relatively movable pistons 132, 134 and 136 that are adjustable to change the position of the enrichment lever 60 and therefore the air fuel ratio as a function of exhaust gas recirculation back into the engine, and operating the engine at cruising conditons for an extended period, or operating the engine at idle speed, all with leaner air fuel ratios. An infinte number of different air fuel ratios can be established.
