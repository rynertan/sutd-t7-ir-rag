## Description
The invention relates to a device for signalling a specific charge condition of an accumulator battery incorporated in a battery powered apparatus by means of an indicator, which device comprises a comparator circuit for comparing the battery voltage with a reference voltage and a switching circuit controlled by the comparator circuit for energising the indicator. An accumulator battery generally comprises at least two storage cells, but the accumulator battery intended here may also comprise a single storage cell. WO Patent Application 80 02248 describes a battery powered shaver with a build in clock device which is powered by a separate battery of small capacity. The clock device is provided with an alarm buzzer that is powered by the shaver battery to save power consumption of the clock battery. The shaver comprises a device that upon detecting the discharge of the shaver battery connects the alarm buzzer to the clock battery to preserve the alarm function of the clock. Devices of the type specified in the opening paragraph are known in many forms. By way of example reference is made to the German Patent Application No. 2,517,138, which has been laid open to public inspection. In the device described therein a series arrangement of a resistor and a capacitor is connected in parallel with the accumulator battery. The voltage across the resistor is applied to a Schmitt trigger circuit, which performs the functions of comparator circuit and switching circuit. The reference voltage is the sum of the base emitter threshold voltage of a first transistor of the trigger circuit and the voltage across a diode in the common emitter path of the two transistors of the Schmitt trigger circuit. As soon as the voltage across the accumulator battery has decreased so far that the voltage applied to the Schmitt trigger circuit is lower than the reference voltage, the second transistor of the trigger circuit will be turned on, so that a light emitting diode arranged in the collector circuit of this transistor lights up. Such a device may be employed in a shaver which is powered by a built in rechargeable battery of storage cells, for example Ni Cd cells, for signalling the charge condition of these cells. However, this has one disadvantage. During shaving the shaver is held against the skin, so that when the light emitting diode lights up during shaving this is generally not noticed by the user. Since the shaver is switched off before it is put away, so that the light emitting diode also extinguishes, it is no longer possible to see after use whether the accumulator battery must be recharged before a following shave. It is the object of the present invention to mitigate the above mentioned drawbacks. According to the invention the device is therefore characterized in that the device comprises a memory circuit for energizing the indicator a predetermined time interval after the apparatus has been switched off, if the switching circuit has energised the indicator prior to switching off. Now the user of the apparatus has an indication, for example for at least a few seconds after the apparatus has been switched off whether recharging is necessary. The signalling point, Switching on of the motor of the apparatus or a brief heavy load on the motor may be attended by a brief current surge. In order to preclude the energization of the indicator in response to the accompanying brief but large voltage drop across the accumulator battery, a device in accordance with the invention may further be characterized in that there is provided a time threshold circuit which inhibits the response of the switching circuit for the indicator to a brief voltage drop across the battery. It is to be noted that United States Patent Specification No. 3,852,732 describes a charge condition indicator which comprises means which preclude a permanent indication that the charging level of the accumulator battery has dropped below a reference level resulting from a brief voltage drop across the battery, for example when the motor is switched on. However, in the known device the indicator does not remain energized after the apparatus has been switched off. A preferred device in accordance with the invention is further characterized in that the time threshold circuit comprises a first logic gate, which is controlled by the comparator circuit, and an up down pulse counter whose count up input and count down inputs are connected to separate outputs of the logic gate, to which logic gate the pulses from a pulse generator are applied, the memory circuit comprises a bistable multivibrator whose set input and reset input are controlled by the pulse counter, and the switching circuit, which is connected to the output of the multivibrator, comprises a plurality of logic gates. In this device the pulses from the pulse generator will be transferred to the pulse counter It is to be noted that in United States Patent Specification No. 3,877,001 a charge condition indicator is described which employs a lightemitting diode which can light up both continuously and intermittently. In the known device, however, the diode is used in a different way as long as the voltage across the accumulator battery remains above a specific level the diode will be lit continuously, whilst the diode blinks if the voltage across the accumulator battery is lower than the reference voltage. The device described in United States Patent Specification No. 3,877,001 does not have a memory function and has a different construction. For example, this known device does not comprise a pulse generator and a pulse counter. An embodiment of the invention in which the indicator comprises at least one light emitting element may be characterized in that there is provided a second bistable multivibrator whose set input is connected to that pulse counter output which is connected to the set input of the first bistable multivibrator, the reset input of the second bistable multivibrator being connected to a point in a charging circuit of the accumulator battery, for receiving a signal at the instant that charging begins, the output of the second bistable multivibrator being connected to the reset input of the first bistable multivibrator The memory circuit comprising the second bistable multivibrator and the additional logic gate ensures that, if during shaving the charge of the accumulator battery has been below the reference level for a sufficiently long time and the apparatus has been put away without being recharged, the user is given an indication that recharging is necessary when the apparatus is switched on for the next shave. An embodiment of the invention, in which the indicator comprises an acoustic element may be characterized in that there is provided an additional logic gate whose first input is connected to a pulse counter output which supplies a signal of comparatively low frequency and whose second input is connected to an output of a frequency divider which supplies a signal of comparatively high frequency anf which is arranged in the pulse generator, and the output of the additional logic gate is connected to the acoustic element If in this apparatus the voltage across the accumulator battery has been below a reference level for a sufficiently long time during use, an acoustic alarm is switched on at the instance that the apparatus is switched off. The acoustic alarm remains operative for some time, for example four seconds, after this. It is to be noted that from Netherlands Patent Application No. 79 08067, which has been laid open to public inspection, it is known per se to employ an acoustic alarm in a charging device in order to indicate that the charging condition of an accumulator battery is poor or satisfactory. However, in the known device the acoustic alarm only remains switched on as long as the apparatus is switched on, so that the alarm signal may be drowned in the motor noise. A device in accordance with the invention may comprise both a visual indicator and an acoustic indicator. The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the drawings. In the drawings In Figure 1 an accumulator battery comprising for example two Ni Cd cells is designated by B, which battery furnishes the supply voltage for the motor M of, for example, a shaving apparatus. S If the voltage V Instead of two light emitting diodes it is also possible to use only one such diode. Except for the voltage divider R The device shown in Figure 1 is shown in more detail, in Figure 2, the elements of the driver circuit DL being also shown. The comparator in this example comprises a first trigger circuit T and a second trigger circuit Schmitt trigger ST, which sharpens the edges of the signal supplied by the trigger circuit T. The resulting signal controls a logic circuit which includes the logic gate G When the apparatus is switched on, If the voltage V If the output Q If the voltage V The use of a counter, which both counts up and counts down has an integrating effect. In the case of a battery voltage on which a sawtooth shaped ripple is superimposed because it is loaded by a collector motor averaging will be effected on the mean value of the battery voltage. When the apparatus is switched off, During said time interval of, for example, four seconds the two diodes L When a different oscillator frequency is used the afore mentioned time intervals of four seconds, two seconds and five hundred milliseconds will be changed whilst maintaining the ratio between these time intervals. The logic circuit is energized When the switch S Figure 3 shows the embodiment of Figure 2 extended to have an additional long term memory function. This function is obtained by means of a second bistable multivibrator FF When the output Q As long as no recharging is effected the multivibrator FF Figure 4 shows a charge condition indicator device in which the indicator is an acoustic element, which is schematically represented by a loudspeaker LS. In the device shown in Figure 4 the two light emitting diodes L By applying this signal together with the signal of, for example, 2 Hz appearing on the output Q Alternatively, it is possible to incorporate both a loudspeaker and one or two light emitting diode in one indicator device, so that after the apparatus has been switched on both an acoustic signal and a light signal are given, if during the preceding use the voltage V The invention has been described for a shaving apparatus, but it is obvious that it may also be employed in other equipment powered by rechargeable accumulator batteries. Firstly, these may be appliances which are hand held in use, such as mixers and drills, so that a visual indicator may be covered or an acoustic indicator signal be drowned in the motor noise. However, the invention may equally be used in non portable appliances such as vacuum cleaners or lawn mowers, which during use are situated at some distance from the user s ears or eyes. Preferably, the indicator is then arranged near the on off button, so that the user will automatically notice the indicator when the apparatus is switched off.
