# ACCELERATOR PEDAL CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLE

## Abstract
Accelerator pedal control characteristics representative of relationship between throttle valve opening rate and accelerator pedal stroke can be selected freely by driver s preference. Therefore, when the vehicle is traveling at a low speed on a busy street and the accelerator pedal and the brake pedal are both repeatedly depressed alternately, the driver accelerates the vehicle in accordance with a control characteristic on which the throttle valve opening rate increases gently with increasing accelerator pedal stroke when the vehicle is travelling at a high speed on a highway, the driver accelerates the vehicle in accordance with another control characteristic on which the throttle valve opening rate increases relatively abruptly with increasing accelerator pedal stroke, thus improving the operability of the acceler ator pedal according to vehicle travelling conditions. The system comprises means 14 for storing a plurality of different predetermined control characteristics represen tative of relationship between throttle valve opening rate and accelerator pedal stroke, means 10 for selecting a desired control characteristic from the stored different control char acteristics, means 11 for detecting the stroke of the accelerator pedal, means 14 for determining throttle valve opening rates corresponding to the detected accelerator pedal stroke S on the basis of the stored control characters tic selected by said selecting means and means 16,17 for driving the throttle valve to the determined throttle valve opening rate for each detected accelerator pedal stroke.
