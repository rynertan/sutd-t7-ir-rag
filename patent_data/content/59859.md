# MOTOR VEHICLE ROOF VENT AND SECURITY LATCH THEREFOR

## Abstract
A roof vent 10 for a motor vehicle is disclosed comprising a vent closure panel 12 and a security latching assembly 20 for removably connecting the closure panel to a supporting framework structure 14 that is mounted at an opening 36 established in the roof of the vehicle. The present latching assembly 20 includes an arrangement 100, 120 and 130 which eliminates the use of the pull pin that has been common to many vent latches of the prior art, so that the closure panel can be easily unlatched only at a location within the interior of the vehicle. Accordingly, the security of the vehicle and its contents may be better preserved. More particularly, the latching assembly 20 includes a sliding disconnect 126 which is not easily operated by a child of tender years. Hence, unauthorized removal of the closure panel 12 by one who is either outside or inside the vehicle can be better prevented. The supporting framework structure 14 is fabricated to include particularly dimensioned slots 88 for receiving therein hinge member 22 that are attached to the vent closure panel 12 , so as to permit a closure panel to be easily and reliably reconnected to its framework structure.
