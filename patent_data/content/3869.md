## Description
EXPANSIBLE BELLOWS This invention relates to an expansible bellows of the type adapted to fonri a seal between a pair of members which reciprocate relatively to one other. A cable actuated control rod requires the use of a seal between the rod and a support member in which the rod is reciprocally mounted. The seal primarily functions to prevent the ingress of dirt particles or the like. A bellows type seal is often employed and requires ballooning thereof upon reciproc ation of the rod or a vent hole formed through the bellows to communi cate ambient air internally thereof when opposite ends of the bellows are secured to the rod and support member, respectively. Ballooning of the bellows subjects it to undue wear and a relatively short fatigue life. In addition, the bellows must be formed out of a relatively thin and stretchable material, such as rubber, which is prone to premature failure. The formation of a hole through the bellows, although overcoming the ballooning problem, has the disadvantage of allowing dirt particles or the like to enter the bellows. In addition, should the hole become plugged, the bellows will become subjected to the above discussed ballooning. A slidable mounting of the rod through an end of the bellows also gives rise to problems. For example, such an arrangement does not provide a positive seal as between the rod and the bellows and any paint, dirt or corrosion, collected on the rod, may tend to work past the sliding seal and enter within the bellows proper.In addition, the resulting drag on the rod will lower the working efficiency of the rod and associated cable. In accordance with the invention, an expansible composite bellows comprises two bellows of different effective cross sectional areas connected together end to end and defining a chamber for retaining a volume of fluid therein, whereby upon relative axial movement of the other ends of the two bellows the lengths of both bellows can change to maintain the volume of the chamber substantially constant. With this arrangement, axial expansion of one bellows can be compensated by axial expansion or contraction of the other bellows without ballooning to maintain the volume of the chamber substantially constant, thereby avoiding the need for any vent hole in the bellows, The bellows may extend in opposite directions from their connected ends or one bellows may be disposed radially inwardly and within the other bellows. Two examples of composite bellows constructed in accordance with the invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an axial section through one example shown in its expanded condition of operation Figure 2 is an elevation illustrating the Figure 1 bellows in a contracted condition of operation Figure 3 is a section similar to Figure 1, but illustrated the second example shown in its expanded condition of operation and, Figure 4 is a section similar to Figure 3 but shows the composite bellows in its dontracted condition of operation. Figure 1 illustrates an expansible composite bellows 10 having opposite ends thereof secured to a rod 11, extending centrally through the bellows, and a tubular support member 12, having the rod reciprocally mounted therein. A screw threaded end of the rod may be suitably connected in a conventional manner to a standard push pull cable control employed for the actuation of brakes, transmission controls or the like.Annular flanges 13 and 14, formed on opposite ends of the composite bellows, are adhesively or otherwise suitably secured to the rod and support member. For example, each flange may be secured in place by a standard band clamp. The composite bellows, adapted to be filled with a fluid such as air, comprises a first bellows section 15 defining a first chamber 16 for retaining a first volume of air therein, and a second bellows section 17 connected in tandem to the first bellows section and defining a second chamber 18 for retaining a second volume of air therein. As described hereinafter, bellows sections 15 and 17 cooperate with each other for retaining the same total volume of air in the bellows upon both axial expansion and contraction thereof. The bellows may be composed of any suitable elastomeric material such as rubber or plastic or may be composed of other materials such as stainless steel. The bellows is suitably pleated as shown, to expand and contract between its Figures 1 and 2 conditions of operation. As further shown, the diameter of bellows section 15 is substantially greater than that of bellows section 17. In operation and with the bellows assuming its expanded condition illustrated in Figure 1, the composite volume of air contained in the bellows the first volume in chamber 16 plus the second volume in chamber 18 may be computed by the formula V . 2 2 L1 t D2 2 2 L2 t D3 2 2 L1 L2 wherein V composite volume of the bellows D the effective diamter of bellows section 15 L the axial length of bellows 1 section 15 the effective diameter of bellows section 17 L axial length of bellows section 17 D3 outside diameter of rod 11 The term effective diameter of a particular segment of the bellows may be defined as the diameter of a cylinder which would displace the same amount of air per unit length as the segment of the bellows. Upon contraction of the bellows to its Figure 2 condition, upon leftward movement of rod 11, bellows section 15 will expand axially in a first rightward direction in response to axial movement of the righthand end of the bellows section 17 in a second leftward , opposite direction.The same total volume of air in the bellows may be computed by the following formula V Tr D1 2 2 L.1 D2 292 L 2 g D3 2 2 L 1 L 2 It should be noted that Th L 3 L1 L2 L 1 L 2 will define the stroke of rod 11 and that diameters D1 ,D2 and D will remain substantially constant upon both expansion and contraction of the bellows0 Thus, no ballooning of the bellows will result, nor is any hole required through the bellows to communicate ambient air internally thereof. Upon contraction of the bellows, the air displaced from the bellows section 17 will be displaced into the bellows section 15 with the procedure reversed upon subsequent expansion of the bellows. Thus, the bellows will be fully and continuously sealed at the flanges 13 and 14 to the rod 11 and the support member 12, respectively, and the bore formed in the support member 12 to receive slidably the rod 11 is fully shielded against ambient dirt particles and the like. Also, since the flange 13 of the bellows is secured to the rod 11 to move therewith, no relative sliding occurs therebetween to give rise to inefficient drag problems on the cable control nor the flaking off of paint, rust, or the like,into the bellows. Furthermore, the bellows 10 may be constructed of a relatively heavy duty material having a thick section throughout whereby the fatigue life of The bellows is greatly increased over conventional ones. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate a modification 10 of the composite bellows wherein identical numerals are used to depict corresponding parts of the first exampleIn this embodiment, a second bellows section 17 is disposed radially inwardly and within a first bellows section 15 and has its open end exposed to ambient.Similar to the Figures 1 and 2 embodiment, bellows section 15 has an effective diameter substantially larger than that of second bellows section 17 . In operation,tlie first bellows section 15 will expand axially in a first rightward direction in response to axial movement of the left hand end of the second bellows section 17 in a second leftard , opposite direction, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. Bellows 10 thus functions similarly to bellows 10 and in substantial accordance with the abo sTe discussed volumetric equations as modified as follows V D1 2 ê L 1 D2 2 2 Lt 2 D3 2 êL 2 The primary difference in their respective functions is that when rod 11 is moved from its Figure 3 to its Figure 4 position. the voutr e displaced in the segment of bellows section 15 having length L2 by bellows section 17 may be considered as being subtracted from rather than added to the volume of fluid originally contained therein. However, it should be understood that the total volume of fluid air contained in the bellows remains the same upon both expansion and contraction thereof.
