# Method of vacuum degassing and refilling a reactor coolant system.

## Abstract
A procedure for vacuum degassing of a reactor coolant sy stem which basically utilizes existing equipment to degas the coolant. The level of gas concentration in the coolant is re duced to low residual levels in less than two hours to expedite shutdown operations. The procedure enhances residual heat removal by using the steam generators as condensers. During draindown of the reactor coolant to the midplane of the reactor vessel outlet nozzles, a two phase pump is used and a vacuum is established in the vapor space created in the reactor pressure vessel, and the steam so generated is condensed in the steam generates while the non condensible gases are withdrawn.
