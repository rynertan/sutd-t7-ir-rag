## Description
OMNIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTOR The present invention relates to an omnidirectional reflector especially designed for industrial light fittings, park light fittings and the like. The object of the invention is to avoid reflection back to the lamp and or to suspension means and or coupling means necessary for the operation of the lamp, the latter being applicable especially to park light fittings. A reflection back to the lamp or other light fitting details strongly reduces the efficiency of the reflector and can in certain cases also shorten the life of the lamp.Thus the invention is directed to an omnidirectional reflector adapted to embrace as a continuous unit a light source situated in the centre of the reflector, said reflector being characterized in that it is divided along the circumference into at least three parts merging in each other, said reflector following a determined curve in the vertical plane in the central portions of the various parts, that each of the parts consists of two relatively reversed sectors which from said curve are bent in the form of circular arcs in the horizdntal plane such that light beams impinging on the sectors adjacent the symmetry plane thereof are reflected outwards from this plane and consequently away from the centre, that light beams impinging on the sectors adjacent the intersection line between the various parts are reflected outwards generally in parallel with the symmetry plane of the sectors, and that intermediate light beams are reflected continuously relative to the angle of incidence towards the sectors, whereby all light is reflected beside the centre of the reflector.Accordingly, the lamp and corresponding central parts will not be exposed to any re reflection. The invention will be described in more detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings which show, on one hand, a prior art reflector and, on the other hand, a number of reflectors according to the invention. In the drawings Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the beam path in the prior art reflector, where Fig. 1 is a vertical section of the reflector and Fig. 2 shows the reflector seen from below Figs. 3 and 4 show a reflector with three identical parts, Fig. 3 being a vertical section of the reflector on line III III in Fig. 4 which shows the reflector seen from below Figs. 5 and 6 show a reflector with four identical parts, Fig. 5 being a vertical section of the reflector on line V V in Fig. 6 which shows the reflector seen from below Figs. 7 and 8 show a reflector with five identical parts, Fig. 7 being a vertical section of the reflector on line VII VII in Fig. 8 which shows the reflector seen from below Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate the beam path in the reflector shown in Figs. 5 and 6, Fig. 9 being a vertical section of the reflector on line IX IX in Fig. 10 which shows the reflector seen from below Fig. 11 shows the isolux curve in a reflector provided with four parts, in which only the opposite parts are alike Figs. 12 and 13 show said reflector, Fig. 12 being a vertical section of the reflector on line XII XII in Fig. 13 which shows the reflector seen from below Figs. 14 and 15 illustrate the beam path in the reflector shown in Figs 12 and 13, Fig. 14 being a vertical section of the reflector while Fig. 15 shows the reflector seen from below. As is apparent from Figs. 1 and 2 some beams are reflected from the reflector back to the lamp. This is the disadvantage that is eliminated by the present invention which will be described primarily with reference to Figs. 5, 6, 9 and 10 according to which the reflector has been divided into four identical parts A, B, C and D since this number appears to give the best solution from a technical as well as an economical point of view. Each part consists of two relatively reversed sectors A , A B , B etc. Each part A, B, C and D is to reflect the light at 900 so that it will be 3600 in total. Thus, each sector A ,A B , B etc. is to reflect the light within 450, as appears from Figs. 9 and 10. The desired light distribution of the reflector in the vertical plane determines the shape of the curve K. When speaking of vertical plane and horizontal plane the normal position of the reflector is intended but of course the position of the reflector in space can be changed within the scope of the invention. The curve K is calculated out or constructed in a conventional manner. Then the reflector is divided into an arbitrary number of horizontal planes L, M, N, 0. Lines R with an angle of 22.50 from the symmetry plane CL of the reflector are drawn from the intersection point between each plane and the curve K. In the same manner lines are drawn with the same angle relative to planes being parallel with the symmetry plane CL from the intersection point of each plane with the intersection line between the parts. The common intersection point e of the lines in each plane will then constitute the centre for radii of circular arcs which in this way form the surface of the reflector. The sectors are thereby bent in the form of circular arcs in conjunction with the predetermined curve K such that light beams impinging on the sectors ajacent the curve K therebetween are reflected 450 out from the symmetry planeCL of the reflector between the two sectors and consequently away from the centre, while light beams impinging the sectors adjacent the intersection line between the various parts are reflected out in parallel with the symmetry planes CL.Between these two limits the beams are reflected continuously relative to the angle of incidence towards the sectors. Practically all light is thus reflected beside the centre of the reflector. From the above description it appears that the actual angle relative to the symmetry planes CL are equal to 900 divided by the number of parts in the reflector. If the reflector has four parts, as in accordance with Figs. 5 and 6, twill thus be equal to 22.50. According to Figs. 3 and 4 the reflector has three parts, and here Twill therefore be equal to 30 . According to Figs. 7 and 8 the reflector has five parts, and therefore alpha will in this case be equal to 18 . With three parts the total radiation angle will be 2 x 600 a part, and with 5 parts 2 x 360 so that it will always be 3600 in total. If it is desired to have an oval light image according to Fig. 11 on the ground, e.g. from a park light fitting, to illuminate e.g. a foot path, then one may allow the angles P and relative to the symmetry plane CL and thus the radii R to vary in the various parts, as appears fromFigs. 12 and 13 which show a reflector with four parts. As is apparent from Figs. 14 and 15 the parts A and C are identical and give each a 600 radiation. The parts B and C are also identical and give each a 120 radiation. This result has been obtained by setting the angle 150 and the angle 9 30 . The radiation angles will thus be equal to 4 x P 600 and 4 x 1200. The sum P must always 0 be 45 in a reflector consisting of four parts since the angles Pand relative to the symmetry plane CL for all the parts in total should be 900. The invention is not restricted to that described above and shown in the drawings but can be modified within the scope of the appended claims.
