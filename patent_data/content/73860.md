## Description
DESULFURIZATION, DEMETALATION AND DENITROCENATION OF COAL This invention relates to the treatment of coal or coal liquids and more particularly to the catalytic treatment of coal and coal liquids to effect removal of sulfur, nitrogen and metal compounds. This invention provides a process for the desulfurization, demetalation and denitrogenation of coal or coal liquid charge stocks containing sulfur impurities which comprises contacting said charge stock in the absence of added hydrogen with a hydrogen donor solvent and with a catalyst comprising a naturally occurring porous metal ore selected from the group consisting of manganese nodules, bog iron, bog manganese, and nickel laterites. The use of manganese compounds in the desulfurization of petroleum fractions is well known. U.S. Patent No. 3,320,157 discloses contacting a hydrocarbon fraction at temperatures from 260 to 3990C 5Ã»O to 750If with manganese hydroxide or hydrous manganese oxide for removing sulfur. U.S. Patent No. 3,330,096 removes sulfur compounds from gases in which manganese nodules are used. U.S. Patent No. 3,214,236 discloses desulfurization, denitrogenation and hydrogenation wherein manganese nodules are catalytically useful. U.S. Patent No. 3,509,041 discloses ion exchange of manganese nodules with hydrogen ions to provide compositions useful in hydrocarbon conversion reactions such as cracking, hydrocracking, oxidation, olefin hydrogenation and isomerization. U.S.Patent Nos. 3,983,030 and 3,813,331 are further representative of demetalization and desulfurization of petroleum residua with manganese nodules. It is also known that certain compounds of iron are useful in the desulfurization of coal. U.S. Patent No. 3,909,213 discloses the use of metal chloride salts such as ferric chloride as capable of dissolving sulfur containing organic compounds in coal. In U.S.Patent No. 3,768,988, ferric ions are employed to remove pyritic sulfur from coal. U.S. Patent No. 3,999,958 discloses the reaction of ferromagnetic particles with coal to remove sulfur. In accordance with the invention, desulfurization, demetalation and denitrogenation of coal or coal liquid charge stocks are carried out by contacting the charge stock in the absence of externally added hydrogen with a hydrogen donor solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of a naturally occurring porous metal ore, such as manganese nodules, bog iron, bog manganese or nickel laterites. The conversion of coal to liquid and gaseous fuel products is of ever increasing importance because of the vast reserves of coal compared to the supply of liquid petroleum. Coal and heavy liquids derived from coal are of low quality because of low hydrogen content and high heteroatom content. These materials can be used as residual or boiler fuels or catalytically upgraded to economically, more desirable liquid and ashless coal products. The catalytic conversion of coal, however, requires a catalyst that is resistant to poisoning by metal contaminants. Additionally, large amounts of sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen further decrease the overall activity of the catalyst. Although various hydrodesulfurization processes have been suggested, such processes are costly because of the high consumption of hydrogen. By the process of the invention, a simple and inexpensive catalyst has been discovered for use in the desulfurization, demetalation and denitrogenation of coal in the absence of externally added hydrogen and in the presence of a hydrogen donor solvent. The catalyst comprises a naturally occurring porous metal ore such as manganese nodules, bog iron, bog manganese or nickel laterites. Such materials are readily available in large quantities and are relatively inexpensive. Further, such ores are capable of effective desulfurization and denitrogenation as well as removing metallic impurities from the coal charge stock. When the porous catalyst material becomes fouled and inactivated in the process, such materials can be discarded without significant effect on the economics of the process because of their low cost. Manganese nodules, as is known, are naturally occurring deposits of manganese, along with other metals, including iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper, found on the floor of bodies of water. They are found in abundance on the floors of oceans and lakes. For example, they are found in abundance on the floor of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and on the floor of Lake Michigan. The nodules are characterized by a large surface area, i.e., in excess of 150 square meters per gram. The nodules have a wide variety of shapes but most often those from the oceans look like potatoes. Those from the floor of bodies of fresh water, such as the floor of LakeMichigan, tend to be smaller in size. Their color varies from earthy black to brown depending upon their relative manganese and iron content. The nodules are porous and light, having an average specific gravity of about 2.4.Generally, they range from 0.32 to 22.9 cm 1 8 to 9 inches in diameter but may extend up to considerably larger sizes approximating 122 cm in length and 91.4 cm in diameter 4 feet and 3 feet, respectively and weighing as much as 772 kg 1700 pounds . In addition to the metals mentioned above, the nodules contain silicon, aluminum, calcium and magnesium, and small amounts of molybdenum, zinc, lead, vanadium, and rare earth metals. The chemical and physical properties of manganese nodules, as catalytic agents for the desulfurization of hydrocarbon charge stocks, are, as compared with conventional catalytic agents for this purpose, considered to be somewhat unusual. The nodules have a high surface area, about 100 250 square meters per gram. They will, however, lose surface area by metal deposition during the desulfurization reaction. Further, as shown by Roger G. Burns andD.W. Fuerstenau in American Mineralogist, Vol. 51, 1966, pp.895 902, Electron Probe Determination of Inter ElementRelationships in Manganese Nodules, the concentrations of the various metals contained in the nodules, i.e., the manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, and nickel, are not uniform throughout the crystalline structure of the nodule. Rather, a traverse across a section of a nodule will show marked differences in the concentrations of the various metals from point to point of the traverse. However, there appears to be a correlation between the concentrations of iron and cobalt. On the other hand, manufactured catalysts are usually as uniform as the manufacturer can achieve. The manganese nodules can be employed as the catalyst for the desulfurization demetalation denitrogenation of the coal charge stock substantially as mined, or recovered, from the floor of the body of water in which they occurred. Thus, the nodules, as mined, possibly after washing to remove sea water or lake water therefrom and mud or other loose material from the surface of the nodules, may be employed. The process of the invention may also be carried out employing, as the catalyst, manganese nodules which have been subjected to a pretreatment. Pretreatment to which the manganese nodules may be subjected includes sulfiding or leaching to remove therefrom one or more components of the nodules. Sulfiding of the manganese nodules can increase the extent of demetalizing of the charge stock. It also can increase the extent of desulfurization and Conradson Carbon Residue CCR reduction, each of which is desirable. This treatment is carried out, for instance, by contacting the nodules with hydrogen sulfide.The hydrogen sulfide may be pure or may be mixed with other gases.However, the hydrogen sulfide should be substantially free of hydrogen. The temperature of sulfiding may be from 1490C 3000F to 2320C 4500F and the time of sulfiding may be from 4 to 8 hours.The sulfiding may be effected, for example, by passing the hydrogen sulfide over the manganese nodules continuously during the sulfiding reaction. The space velocity of the hydrogen sulfide is not critical and any space velocity compatible with the equipment and such that some hydrogen sulfide is continuously detected in the exit stream is suitable. The manganese nodules may also be pretreated by being subjected to leaching to remove therefrom one or more components.As mentioned previously, the manganese nodules contain, in addition to manganese, copper, nickel, and molybdenum. They may be pretreated to leach therefrom the copper, nickel, or molybdenum, or any two, or all three, of these metals. The manganese nodules contain the copper, nickel, and molybdenum in sufficient quantities to provide a commercial source of these metals. Further, the removal, at least partially, of these metals and other of the metallic constituents of the nodules apparently has no deleterious effect on the catalytic activity of the nodules. Thus, by this embodiment of the invention, copper, nickel, molybdenum and other metals may be recovered from the nodules for the economic advantage to be gained by such recovery and the remainder of the manganese nodules can then be employed as a catalyst. Removal of the copper and the nickel may be effected by leaching the manganese nodules with an aqueous solution of a strong acid. By strong acid is meant such acids as hydrochloric, sulfuric, and nitric acids. The molybdenum may be removed from the manganese nodules by leaching them with aqueous base solutions such as aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. These solutions should have a pH of at least 8 and preferably should have a pH of at least 10. The leaching with the aqueous base solutions can be carried out at ambient temperatures or at the boiling point of the solution. The nodules, with or without pretreatment, may be crushed and sized to obtain a desired particle size depending upon the type of operation employed, for example, a fixed bed operation, an ebullated bed operation or otherwise. The catalyst, after being employed and having become catalytically deactivated or spent, can be treated for recovery of valuable metals such as copper, nickel, molybdenum, and the like.It may also be treated to recover any other component. Another naturally occurring porous metal ore which can be used for the desulfurization demetalation denitrogenation process is the loosely aggregated ore obtained from marshy ground which is known as bog iron. Bog iron is a variety of limonite, a naturally occurring hydrated oxide of iron 2Fe203.3H20 which contains about 60 weight percent iron. It is yellow to brown in color and has been formed by the alteration of other iron minerals, e.g., by oxidation and or hydration. Bog iron is a common and important ore found in the United States and Europe. It is amorphous and is characterized by a surface area in excess of 10 square meters per gram, a hardness Mohs of 5 to 5.5, and an average specific gravity of 3.6 to 4. The bog iron can be employed substantially as mined but is preferably washed with hot water to remove mud and other loose material. The iron is then crushed, dried to a constant weight and sieved to 10 20 mesh U.S. Series . If desired, the bog iron may be leached and or sulfided in the manner indicated above for manganese nodules. Bog manganese is another naturally occurring porous metal ore which can be used. This ore may also be pretreated by leaching and or sulfided. Bog manganese is similar to bog iron and consists mainly of oxide of manganese and water, with some oxide of iron, and often silica, alumina, baryta. It is amorphous, has a surface area greater than 10 square meters per gram, a hardness Mohs of about 6 and a specific gravity of 3.0 to 4.26. Bog manganese is not regarded as representing a distinct mineral species from psilomelane, a colloidal manganese oxide with various adsorbed impurities. Bog manganese occurs in Europe and is associated with the Lake Superior hematite deposits in Michigan. Other suitable ores having a surface area in excess of 10 square meters per gram which can be employed include nickel bearing laterite ores. Lateritic nickel ores of the silicate type, such as the usual laterites and garnierites, are found in southeast Asia,Cuba, Czechoslovakia, New Caledonia, the Philippines, Indonesia,Greece, Yugoslavia, Guatemala and Venezuela. These ores normally contain free and combined water and analyze on a dry basis less than 3 weight percent nickel, less than 0.15 weight percent cobalt and more than 15 weight percent iron.A typical analysis of laterite ore is as follows TABLE I Wt. Dry Wt. Dry Ni Co 2.3 2.9 as NiO Fe 18.5 26.5 as Fe3 Cr 1.2 1.7 as Cr203 MgO 15 15 Si02 35 35 A1203 4.5 4.5 CaO 0.1 0.1 LOI 11.5 11.5 Unacct. 100 Nickel ores are ideally suited as catalysts for the process of the invention and can be used directly as mined and without further upgrading. If desired, these ores may be pretreated by leaching and or sulfided in the manner heretofore described. The desulfurization demetalation denitrogenation process is carried out in the presence of a hydrogen donor solvent. An amount of coal and solvent will generally be used such that the weight ratio of solvent to coal will be from 0.5 to 8 1, preferably about 2 1. The donor solvent materials are well known and among suitable donor materials there may be mentioned hydroaromatic, naphthene aromatic and compounds such as hydronaphthalanenes, for example Tetralin, hydroanthracenes, hydrophenanthrenes and the like. Compounds having at least 1 and preferably 2, 3 or 4 aromatic nuclei and being partially hydrogenated to include aromatic resonance and containing olefinic bonds serve as excellent hydrogen donors. Fully aromatic structures are ineffective as hydrogen donors. Completely hydrogenated condensed ring molecules have only a small hydrogen transfer propensity.Therefore hydrogen donors are preferentially created by partial hydrogenation of polynuclear aromatics to introduce on the average from 1 to 3 hydrogen molecules, leaving at least one ring partially hydrogenated. It will be understood that the hydrogen donor solvent may be obtained from any source. Of particular value are the solvents available from coal processing systems, e.g., an intermediate stream boiling between 1770C 350oF and 4820C 9000F , preferably between 2040C 4000F and 371oC 700oF , derived from a coal liquefaction process. Streams of this type comprise hydrogenated aromatics, naphthenic hydrocarbons, phenolic materials and similar compounds, and contain at least 30 weight percent up to 50 weight percent of compounds which are known to be hydrogen donors. See, for example,U.S. Patent No. 3,841,991. The hydrogen donor solvent material can be regenerated externally by conventional means, e.g., catalytic hydrogenation, and may be recycled if desired. The recycle donor solvent need not be a pure hydrogen donor material or a mixture of the same but can be substantially diluted with an inert solvent. Other hydrogen containing solvents may be used instead of, or in conjunction with, either petroleum or coal derived solvents.Such materials include water miscible and immiscible lower alphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol butanol, pentanol, hexanol cycloaliphatic alcohols, such as cyclohexanol, and ethers such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether. The desulfurization demetalation denitrogenation reaction is carried out by contacting the coal charge stock with the catalyst in the presence of a hydrogen donor solvent material. The temperature employed will range from 2320C 4500F to 5660C 10500F and is preferably from 3430C to 4550C 6500 to 8500F . The amount of catalyst used in the process may vary over a wide range, but the usual amount will be from 0.5 to 100 by weight based on the weight of coal, preferably 1 to 20 percent by weight. The coal charge stock along with the solvent may be passed upwardly through a fixed bed of the catalyst in an upflow reactor or may be passed downwardly through a fixed bed of the catalyst in a downflow trickle bed reactor. The reaction may also be carried out by passing the charge stock and solvent through an ebullient bed of the catalyst.The reaction may also be carried out by contacting the charge stock solvent and catalyst in a batch reactor. Any solid carbonaceous material may be employed as coal , in the process of this invention including natural coals such as high and low volatile bituminous, lignite, brown coal, peat or solvent refined coal or related modified coal. The coal may be high ash, high metals, high sulfur, and have poor caking characteristics, and still be quite suitable for this process scheme. The process scheme is particularly useful in removing the last most difficult to remove sulfur in order to meet combustion specifications in natural coals or solvent refined coals. The coal, prior to use in the process of the invention, is preferably ground in a suitable attrition machine, such as a hammermill, to a size such that at least 50 percent of the coal will pass through a 40 mesh U.S. Series sieve. The ground coal is then dissolved or slurried in a suitable solvent.If desired, the solid carbonaceous material can be treated, prior to reaction herein, using any conventional means known in the art, to remove therefrom any materials forming a part thereof that will not be converted to liquid herein under the conditions of the reaction. Typical analyses of various coals suitable for use are as follows Hiqh Volatile A Sulfur 1.33S Nitrogen 1.63 Oxygen 7.79 Carbon 80.88 Hydrogen 5.33 Ash 2.77 Sub Bituminous Sulfur 0.21 Nitrogen 0.88 Oxygen 15.60 Carbon 65.53 Hydrogen 5.70 Ash 3.99 Lignite Sulfur 0.53 Nitrogen 0.74 Oxygen 32.04 Carbon 54.38 Hydrogen 5.42 Ash 5.78 Although coal is the principal material to be converted by the process of this invention, it need not be the only solid carbonaceous material converted.For example, from 1 to 50 weight percent of materials such as municipal refuse, rubber either natural or synthetic , cellulosic wastes, other waste polymers which heretofore have been buried, burned, or otherwise disposed of may be added to the coal feed. Also included is biomass which may be defined as a renewable carbon source such as grass, corn, trees, kelp and other sea weeds. The addition of such materials to this process increases the yield of valuable liquid fuel products from low cost, relatively available material otherwise requiring disposal. The following examples illustrate the best mode now contemplated for carrying out the invention. EXAMPLES 1 4 In Table III below, a 300 cc stainless steel autoclave was charged with 5 grams of short contact time solvent refined coal Examples 1 4 and Monterey coal Example 5 . The feed of Examples 1 4 material was entirely soluble in tetrahydrofuran. The indicated amounts of hydrogen donor solvents and catalyst, if used, were added. The autoclave was sealed, pressure tested with argon, charged with one atmosphere argon, and heated in one to two hours with stirring to the temperature indicated. The system was held for the time and temperature indicated under autogeneous pressure with stirring, and then quenched within one to two minutes by forcing water through a cooling coil in contact with the autoclave contents. The vessel was opened and the contents washed out with tetrahydrofuran.The catalyst was Soxhlet extracted with tetrahydrofuran and the extract added to the other liquids. The solvent was then removed with a rotary evaporator. Distillation under vacuum yielded the 3430C 6500F solvent refined product. EXAMPLE 5 In this example, the feed material was a Monterey coal MT similar to the feed from which the solvent refined coal of Examples 1 4 was generated. It contained 2.70 wt. organic sulfur. In this example about 25 grams of coal was injected as approximately a 2 1 slurry in a synthetic solvent 2 Y picoline, 18 p cresol, 42S tetralin, 38 2 methyl naphthalene into a preheated solvent of the same mixture. The mixture was stirred at 4270C 8000F for 90 minutes under 9292 kPa 1333 psi of hydrogen pressure. The mixture was quenched and worked up in the manner indicated above except that pyridine was used for the extraction. The solvent coal ratio was 6 1.

In addition, there was a substantial reduction in N, 0, and ash metal components.With NaX molecular sieve Example 1 the yield was low and desulfurization was negligible. In the blank reaction no catalystExample 2 the yield was low and desulfurization was inadequate.Example 5 is a suitable reaction for comparison because the feed to the other runs is equivalent to the SRC produced in situ in about 4 minutes in Example 5. In this example, even with tetralin, andH2, and coal minerals present as a possible catalyst, desulfurization only from 1.9 to 1.5 wt. was achieved. To meet present boiler fuel specifications, however, sulfur contents should be approximately 0.9 wt. . The manganese nodules used in Examples 3 and 4 were obtained from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. These nodules, after recovery from the ocean bottom, were washed to remove salt water and mud. They were then crushed, leached with boiling water five times, dried to constant weight at 100 C., and sieved to 14 30 mesh U S. Standard Sieve Series . The nodules had the following physical characteristics and chemical composition.

The ore is crushed, dried to a constant weight at lOO0C and sieved to 30 mesh U.S. Series . Five grams of this sieved material is mixed with 5 grams of solvent refined coal Monterey short contact time coal and 75 grams of solvent consisting of 25 grams of isopropanol and 50 grams 2 methyl naphthalene.The mixture is heated to a temperature of 4270C 8000F for 2 hours. After cooling, the reaction mixture is washed with tetrahydrofuran. The bog iron catalyst is then extracted with tetrahydrofuran and this extract is added to the other liquids. The solvent is removed by evaporation and upon subsequent distillation a solvent refined product of reduced sulfur nitrogen and ash content is obtained.

The ore is crushed, dried to a constant weight at 1M OC and sieved to 25 mesh U.S. Series . Five grams of this sieved material is mixed with 5 grams of solvent refined coal Monterey short contact time coal and 75 grams of solvent consisting of 25 grams of methanol and 50 grams 2 methyl naphthalene. The mixture is heated to a temperature of 4270C 8000F for 2 hours. After cooling, the reaction mixture is washed with tetrahydrofuran. The nickel catalyst is then extracted with tetrahydrofuran and this extract is added to the other liquids. The solvent is removed by evaporation and upon subsequent distillation a solvent refined coal product of reduced sulfur, nitrogen and ash content is obtained.
