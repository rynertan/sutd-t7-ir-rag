## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN FOOD SUPPORTS FOR OVENS The present invention relates to an oven having a rotatory multi level food support. A long standing problem with microwave ovens is that food placed in the oven acts as a load that disturbs the pattern of the microwaves in the oven. One way of remedying this problem is to keep the food still and displace the pattern of microwaves by means of a rotatory reflector called a stirrer. The other way, with which this invention is concerned, is to keep the microwave pattern still and displace the food by means of a rotatory support such as a turntable. The analogy in conventional cooking is to food being cooked on a spit over a fire, the fire establishing a fixed thermal pattern and the food on the spit being rotated to give even heating. A rotatably mounted and motorised shelf support for a microwave oven in which vertically spaced shelves are supported by a framework with vertical rods is described in US A 3428772. There is currently proposed a development in which conventional thermal ovens should be fitted with a microwave cooking facility to assist in cooking of the food. This will enable all food to be cooked in a single oven rather than having a conventional oven and a separate microwave oven which is more expensive and takes up more space in the kitchen. But to get a good energy distribution the microwave energy should be injected from the centre of the back of the oven where it will interfere with the fan or from the centre of the oven door which is manifestly impractical . So again a rotatory support arrangement is desirable, but is complicated by the fact that conventional ovens commonly have three or four shelves that are adjustable for height, and similar facilities will be wanted when using microwaves. The present invention provides an oven having a multi level rotatory food support therein comprising frame means adapted to hold removable food supports in a level attitude at a plurality of different vertically spaced positions, said frame means including side members and a rear member that engage the food supports and being open at the front so that the food supports and food thereon can be inserted or removed from the front of said frame means, drive means for rotating the frame means and control means responsive to the angular position of the frame means or of means associated therewith and operable when the drive means is switched off to cause the motor to continue to rotate to park the frame means in a predetermined angular position. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic horizontal section of an oven according to the invention Figure 2 is a view from the side of the oven showing the turntable and shelf structure together with a drive and control unit Figure 3 is a fragmentary view of the rear part of the shelf structure showing how a shelf clips in place and Figure 4 is a circuit diagram of a possible motor drive and control unit. In the drawings an oven has a floor 10, side walls 11, a rear wall 12 and a roof. A door 14 that does not transmit microwaves is pivoted to the oven by means of brackets 15. Between an apertured rear partition 17 and the rear wall 12 there is a forced circulation heater unit 18 including a fan driven by a motor 19. The oven is further provided with a magnetron 20 for carrying out microwave cooking and a waveguide 21 that leads the microwaves from the magnetron 20 into the oven cavity. In the oven cavity there is provided a turntable and a shelf support unit generally denoted by the reference numeral 25 that supports a plurality of removable shelves 30a 30c. As is apparent from Figures 2 and 3 the shelf support frame or unit 25 is made of metal wire and comprises a base shelf 26 having bars and bounded by a circular lower rail 27 that rests upon the rim 23 of a dished turntable 24. Welded to the rail 27 is a rear post 28 that has a number in this instance three of U bends 29a, 29b, 29c that define supports that locate and retain a plurality of removable generally circular shelves 30a, 30b, 30c. The shelf unit further comprises a member of inverted U shape when viewed from the front that has a semi circular limb welded to the rear post 28 and defining a top rail 31 from whose ends depend side posts 32 that are welded to the bottom rail 27.The side posts 32 are also formed with shelf locating and retaining U bends 33a, 33b, 33c conforming to those in the rear post 28 and serving to locate the sides of the shelves 30a, 30b, 30c and support them in a horizontal attitude. It will be noted that the vertical part of the shelf support unit 25 is defined by the rear post 28 and the two side posts 32 but that it is open to the front so that food dishes can be conveniently inserted onto and removed from the shelves in a level attitude and the shelves 30a 30c can themselves be removed without tilting. The shelves, as is apparent from Figure 3 which shows the shelf 30b, comprise metal bars 35 and a circular rim 36 that locates in the U bends 29b, 33b. At the back of the shelf 30b a spring locating clip 37 is attached to the rim 36 and has a tongue 38 that clips onto the rear post 28. Thus the shelf 30b may be inserted into the frame by sliding it in a level attitude into place with the clip 37 just to the side of the rear post 28 and then rotating it about a vertical axis until the tongue 38 locates on the post 28. Correspondingly the shelf 30b may be removed by rotating it in the reverse direction until the tongue 38 disengages from the post 28 and then sliding the shelf forwardly. It will be appreciated that variations are possible, for example the shelves could carry spring clips like Terry clips that are a simple push fit onto the rear post 28.The frame may in use have all the shelves 30a 30c in place or it may have only some of them depending upon the food being cooked and the shelves are insertable at different heights with the same ease as in a conventional electric or fan oven. A hook 40 at the rear of the shelf support unit 25 engages the rim 23 of the turntable 24 to hold the shelf support unit 25 in place on the turntable. It will be noted that the lower rail 27 is of slightly larger diameter than the turntable 24 so that the fixed bottom shelf locates around the turntable rim 23 and is securely held while in use. But it can also rest on the rim 23 of the turntable, in which case further clamping means is desirable so that the support unit 25 cannot come off the turntable 24 while the oven is in use. The shelf support unit 25 can be removed from the turntable for cleaning purposes simply by lifting it off. The turntable 24 is driven by a motor 42 beneath the floor 1G of the oven and the drive shaft or spindle 43 has a position indicating device such as an encoder 44 that is connected to motor control logic unit 45. The arrangement is such that the logic unit 45 causes the motor 42 to rotate the turntable 24 as required but when the motor 42 is not in oeration the turntable 24 is caused to stop in a unique parked position. Thereby the open side of the shelf strcture can be caused always to stop opposite the oven door 14 so that the food and shelves are accessible.It may be arranged that the turntable 24 and the shelf support unit 25 have inter engaging formations such that the shelf support unit will fit onto the turntable 24 only in one angular position. The shaft position can be detected by devices other than an encoder eg. a cam and cam follower on the drive shaft 43. Alternatively the shaft 43 could carry a disc with a magnet in one location that approached a proximity switch once per revolution. Figure 4 shows a possible arrangement of this kind in which the motor 42 can be energised through a pair of parallel paths 50, 51 from a power unit 52. The path 50 has a switch 53 that is closed whenever the door 14 is closed so that the motor 42 runs continuously whenever the door 14 is closed. The path 51 has a proximity switch 54 that is closed unless the shelf support unit 25 and shaft 43 are in a predetermined angular position. Thus when the door 14 is opened the motor 42 is energised through path 51 until shaft 43 has reached the required angular position, after which switch 54 opens and the motor 42 stops, thereby parking the shelf support 25 in the required predetermined position. Various modifications may be made to the embodiment described herein without departing from the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims. For example in addition to wire shelves 30a 30c, the set of removable food supports may include ceramic dishes and pans which are flanged to fit the U bends 29a 29c and 33a33c. The shelves 30a 30c and shelf structure 25 need not be circular in plan provided that they are rotatable within the oven cavity, and other shapes such as an octagonal shape may be used. It is doubtful, however, whether shelves with less than six sides are desirable. Instead of being built into the floor 10, the drive could be built into the roof of the oven and the shelf structure 25 could be suspended therefrom and releasably connected thereto. The invention is particularly intended for use with ovens that cook by means of a combination of thermal heating and microwaves but it could be used in a pure microwave oven or even in a pure thermal oven or fan oven.
