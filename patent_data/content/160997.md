## Description
The present invention relates to an ion selective electrode. More particularly, the invention relates to an ion selective electrode appropriately employable for the potentiometric determination of a sodium ion. The ion selective electrode is a device for the potentiometric determination of ion concentration in an aqueous sample, and a body fluid such as blood or serum. Its elemental structure is disclosed, for instance, in JP A 1042584 and US A 4 053 381. In more detail, the ion selective electrode has an integral structure comprising a support, an electroconductive metal layer e.g., deposited silver metal layer , a layer of a water insoluble salt of said metal e.g., a layer of silver chloride , an electrolyte layer which comprises an electrolyte salt of a cation e.g., potassium ion or sodium ion with the same anion as the anion of the water insoluble salt, for instance, potassium chloride or sodium chloride. In practically determining ion concentration by means of an ion selective electrode i.e., half cell having the above described elemental structure, the following procedures are adopted A couple of ion selective electorodes A B are connected via a water retainable bridge. On the ion selective electrodes A B are spotted a standard liquid reference liquid and a liquid sample, respectively, and the potential difference between both electroconductive layers of the ion selective electrodes A B are measured after lapse of a certain period of time. The measured potential deifference is then compared against a calibration curve to determine the concentration of the electrolyte. Alternatively, a couple of ion selective electrodes insulated from each other by a scratched groove disclosed in JP A 1056848 can be used for the measurement in the same manner. The ion selective electrode is composed basically of the above stated simple structure and can be manufactured in the form of a small sized chip. Accordingly, the ion selective electrode is very advantageously employed for the determinination of an electrolyte in a small amount of a liquid sample such as a body liquid. In most cases, a body liquid is available for the determination in a very limited amount. Moreover, the ion selective electrode is employable as a disposable device, because it can be formed in a simple structure and in a small size. It has been noted, however, that a measured value obtained in the use of a small sized ion selective electrode sometimes is not reliable. This arises from fluctuation of electric potential i.e., potential drift which often takes place in the measurement procedure. It is thought that the potential drift is reduced by the use of an ion selective electrode in which the thickness of each of the functional layers is increased. However, the increase of the thickness of layers not only results in increase of cost for manufacturing the device, but also results in decrease of the sensitivity. An improvement for obviating the occurrence of the potential drift or other disadvantageous problems has been proposed in JP A 100 7852. This improvement comprises preparing a binderless electrolyte layer by vapor deposition of the electrolyte or by a series of procedures of coating an aqueous electrolyte solution containing no binder and then drying the coated layer. This art provides an ion selective electrode which is reduced in occurrence of the potential drift taken place in the conventional ion selective electrode. Nevertheless, more reduction of the possible potential drift is desired for the purpose of enhancing the accuracy of the meaurement in the use of ion selective electrode. US A 4 214 968 is directed to a dry operative ion selective electrode comprising a dried, internal reference electrode, and in contact with the reference electrode, a hydrophobic ion selective membrane. According to the study of the present inventors, it has been noted that the electrolyte layer prepared from an aqueous electrolyte solution containing no binder by a coating drying procedure comprises a relatively large sized crystalline electrolytes. Therefore, the crystalline electrolytes are not distributed uniformly in the layer and the resulting electrolyte layer is apt to have a large thickness. The non uniform electrolyte layer and thick electrolyte layer both serve to decrease the accuracy of measurement. The preparation of an electrolyte layer by vapor deposition of an electrolyte is disadvantageous in an industrially available scale, because the vapor deposition of an electrolyte giving a low vapor pressure is difficultly employed, and otherwise the vapor deposition of an electrolyte decomposable at a vaporized temperature requires specific carefulness so that no high vaporization efficiency is expected. Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide an ion selective electrode which is appropriately employable for the analysis of a sodium ion through potentiometric determination and is reduced in the occurrence of phenomena bringing about measurement errors such as the potential drift. Another object of the invention is to provide an ion selective electrode for the determination of a sodium ion which is shortened in the response period at the measurement. A further object of the invention is to provide an ion selective electrode appropriately employable for the analysis of a sodium ion a body liquid. The present invention resides in an integral ion selective electrode for the analysis of a sodium ion comprising a support, an electroconductive metal layer, a layer of a water insoluble salt of said metal, an electrolyte layer which comprises an electrolyte salt of a sodium ion with the same anion as the anion of the water insoluble salt, said electrolyte layer being free from a binder, and an ion selective layer, which is characterized in that the electrolyte layer comprises crystalline electrolyte having mean particle size of not more than 8 µm. The above described ion selective electrode can be prepared by a process which comprises forming the electrolyte layer by coating an aqueous solution containing the electrolyte salt but containing substantially no binder on the layer of a water insoluble salt and drying thus coated layer by bringing it in contact with a stream of gas maintained at a temperature of not lower than 40 Further, the above described ion selective electrode can be prepared by a process which comprises forming the electrolyte layer by coating a solution containing the electrolyte salt but containing substantially no binder in a mixture of water and an organic solvent on the layer of a water insoluble salt and drying thus coated layer. Fig. I illustrates an ion selective electrode equipped with a bridge which is employed for the measurement according to the differential method. Fig. 2 shows graphically a variation with time of elecric potential observed in the measurement according to the direct method using an ion selective electrode of the invention. Fig. 3 shows graphically a variation with time of elecric potential observed in the measurement according to the direct method using another ion selective electrode of the invention. As described hereinbefore, the elemental structure of the ion selective electrode provided by the present invention which comprises a support, an electroconductive metal layer, a layer of a water insoluble salt of said metal, an electrolyte layer comprising an electrolyte salt of a sodium ion with the same anion as the anion of the water insoluble salt, said electrolyte layer being substantially free from a binder, and an ion selective layer is as such known. For instance, such embodiment is disclosed in JP A 10017852. The ion selective electrode of the invention can be prepared in the same manner as in the conventional arts except that the electrolyte layer is prepared in a different manner. The constitution of the ion selective electrode end materials employed for the preparation can be determined on the basis of the disclosures in JP A 1042584 JP A 10017852 and JP A 2011648. For instance, the support can be prepared from a film or sheet of plastic material such as polyethylene terephthalate. A representative electroconductive metal layer is a silver metal layer formed on a surface of the support by vapor deposition. In the case that the electroconductive metal layer is a silver metal layer, the layer of a water insoluble salt can be produced by chemical oxidation chlorination of the surface portion of the silver metal layer to form a silver chloride layer, or by coating a dispersion containing silver chloride and a binder on the surface of the silver metal layer and drying the coated layer. On the layer of a water insoluble salt is formed an electrolyte layer. The constitution of the electrolyte layer is a characteristic feature of the invention and shall be described hereinafter in detail. The ion selective layer is capable of selecting a specific ion, and shows a high electric resistance and is a substantially electric insulative in a dry state prior to contact with a liquid sample or a reference liquid. The capability of selecting a specific ion includes not only a property of selectively allowing permeation of the specific ion or selectively responding to the specific ion but also a property of selecting a specific ion from other ions or substances with a time differential enough for detecting the specific ion. Moreover, certain materials employable for the formation of the ion selective layer are capable of detecting a potential difference on the ion activity change occurring in the course of ion exchange, whereby showing the same property as the property of selecting a specific ion. This property is also included in the capacity of selecting a specific ion. The ion selective layer ought to be water insoluble, because a liquid sample and a reference sample both are aqueous liquids. The ion selective layer can be either hydropholic or hydrophobic, as far as the layer is water insoluble. However, a hydrophobic ion selective layer is preferred. The ion selective layer can be prepared in the known manner. For instance, a solution of an ion carrier and a hydrophobic organic binder in an ion carrier solvent is coated on the electrolyte layer and dried to give an ion selective layer. The ion carrier is generally coated in the amount of 0.05 10 g m², and the thickness of the ion selective layer ranges from 3 µm to 125 µm, preferably from 5 µm to 50 µm. The hydrophobic organic binder can be a film forminng natural polymer, its derivative, or a synthetic polymer. Examples of the hydrophobic organic binder include cellulose ester, polyvinyl chloride, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, polyvinylidene chloride, polyacrylonitrile, polyurethane, and polycarbonate of bisphenol A. Details on the ion carrier, ion carrier solvent, hydrophobic organic binder and ion selective layer are given not only in the aforementioned JP A 49000081, but also in JP A 1056848, US A 4 053 381, US A 4 171 246, and US A 4 214 968 and Research Disclosure No. 16113 September 1977 . Moreover, an ion exchangeable material can be used for the formation of the ion selective layer. In this case, a response on the potential difference originating from change of ion activity caused by the ion exchange is measured. Appropriate ion exchangeable materials and preparation of the ion selective layer using these materials are described in JP A 52047717. A representative example of the ion exchangeable material is trialkylammonium chloride for ion exchange of a chloride ion. The ion selective electrode of the present invention is characterized in that the sodium salt electrolyte layer is substantially free from a binder and comprises crystalline electrolytes have mean particle size of not more than 8 µm, preferably 0.1 to 50 µm, more preferably 0.5 to 40 µm, in which the crystalline electrolyte is preferably distributed densely and uniformly on the layer of a water insoluble salt of a metal constituting the electro conductive layer hereinafter referred to as water insoluble salt layer . Preferably, the crystalline electrolytes electrolyte crystals are not arranged in piles in the direction vertical to the plane of the ion selective electrode. Accordingly, the mean thickness of the electrolyte layer preferably is almost equal to the mean size of the crystalline electrolytes. In the ion selective electrode of the present invention, the electrolyte layer is formed by arranging uniformly crystalline electrolyte of a small size without using a binder over the surface of the water insoluble salt layer. The crystalline electrolyte is densely arranged, and a relatively thin electrolyte layer can be formed. An ion selective layer having such electrolyte layer shows quick response and is prominently reduced in occurrence of the potential drift. Moreover, the ion selective electrode of the invention is almost free from separation of the functinal layers at the electrolyte layer which is sometimes observed in the use of an ion selective electrode having a binderless electrolyte layer. The reason is thought to reside not only in evenness of the electrolyte layer and decrease of the thickness but also in that the small sized electrolyte crystals defined in the invention are at least partly engaged physically with the water insoluble salt layer. Particularly, where the water insoluble salt layer is a porous silver chloride layer, the engagement between the crystalline electrolyte and the water insoluble salt layer i.e., silver chloride layer is prominently observed. In the case that the electrolyte layer is nearly a single particle layer composed of regulaly distributed small sized crystalline particles, the electrolyte layer is substantially free from poor contact or adhesion between the electrolyte layer and the ion selective layer, which are sometimes observed in the binder containing electrolyte layer of the conventional ion selective electrode. According to the study of the present inventors, the sodium electrolyte salt crystals having the small mean particle size defined in the invention are not formed by the conventional method which comprises procedures of simply coating an aqueous binderless electrolyte solution on the surface of the water insoluble salt layer and drying under ambient conditions. It has been discovered that the conventional process comprising procedures of coating an aqueous solution of sodium electrolyte salt such as sodium chloride or sodium bromide on the water insoluble salt layer and allowing the coated layer to dryness at room temperature generally gives crystalline electrolyte of large mean particle size such as not less than 10 µm. The electrolyte layer composed of such large sized crystalline electrolyte is poor in the evenness of the distribution of the electrolytes and the thickness of the electrolyte layer. Accordingly, the potential drift is apt to appear more easily and the response time becomes longer because of thus formed thick electrolyte layers. The electrolyte layer of the present invention can be prepared by a process which comprises forming the electrolyte layer by coating an aqueous solution of the electrolyte salt on the water insoluble salt layer and drying thus coated layer by bringing it in contact with a stream of gas maintained at a temperature of not lower than 40 Preferably, the electrolyte layer of the invention is prepared by a process which comprises forming the electrolyte layer by coating a solution of the electrolyte salt in a mixture of water and an organic solvent on the water insoluble salt layer and drying thus coated layer. There is no specific limitation on the drying conditions, but the coated layer is preferably dried by a stream of gas at a temperature of not lower than 40 The latter process using a mixture of water and an organic solvent is particularly preferred to produce a crystalline electrolyte of a smaller size. Moreover, thin process is advantageous in the preparation of the ion selective electrode in a continuous form. In more detail, the ion selective electrode is manufactured industrially by initially producing an ion selective electrode in a continuous form on a continuous plastic sheet and then dividing it to gives a multiple of ion selective electrodes. The use of a mixture of water and an organic solvent which is miscible with water is effective not only to shorten the period required for the formation of the electrolyte layer but also to facilitate the preparation of the electrolyte layer comprising crystalline electrolytes uniformly and densely distributed over the water insoluble salt layer. The mixture of water and an organic solvent is preferably in the range of 2 8 to 8 2. Examples of the organic solvent include lower aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and isopropanol, aliphatic ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and diethyl ketone, ethers such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, and esters of lower aliphatic acids with lower aliphatic alcohols such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate. The organic solvent can be employed singly and in combination. There is no specific limitation on the concentration of the aqueous electrolyte solution which may contain an organic solvent employed for the preparation of the electrolyte layer. Generally, the concentration of the electrolyte in the solution ranges from approx. 0.5 to approx. 20 by weight, preferably approx. 0.5 to approx. 15 by weight, more preferably approx. 0.5 to approx. 10 by weight. An electrolyte solution of a higher concentration within the above defined range is preferably employed for enhancing the efficiency in the industrial manufacturing or the electrode. The anion which is a counter ion to the sodium ion, both consisting in the electrolyte salt of the electrolyte layer of the invention ought to be identical to the anion of the water insoluble salt. Accordingly, the anion is selected in consideration of the whole constitutional conditions of the ion selective electrode. Generally, the electroconductive layer is made of a silver metal, and the water insoluble salt is composed of silver chloride. For this reason, sodium chloride is generally employed as the electrolyte. Nevertheless, if the anion of the water insolube salt is an anion other than the chloride ion, such as a bromide ion, iodide ion, sulfonium ion or carboxylic ion, the anion of the electrolyte salt is selected to be consistent with the above selected anion. The present invention is further described by the following examples. On a polyethylene terephthalate film thickness 188 µm, 30 mm x 100 mm was formed a silver metal layer of approx. 800 nm thick by vapor deposition under vacuum. The deposited silver metal layer is covered at both sides by means of a liquid resist of the polymer composition described in JP A 58102146. The center portion of the deposited silver metal layer was removed by scratching with a cutter knife to form an insulating area of a V shape. The exposed portion of the deposited silver metal layer was processed in a processing solution containing hydrochloric acid and potassium dichromate aqueous solution containing hydrochloric acid 36 mmol. ℓ and potassium dichromate 16 mmol. ℓ for approx. 60 sec., whereby the oxidation and chlorination took place. After the processing was complete, the composite element was washed with water and dried to give a filmy silver silver chloride electrode i.e., a composite of the support, electrocondutive silver metal layer, and a silver chloride layer . On the silver silver chloride electrode film was coated an aqueous sodium chloride 3 solution, and the coated layer was dried by applying thereto an air stream of approx. 150 On thus formed electrolyte layer was then coated a sodium ion selective layer thickness 20 µm of the below described composition was formed in the conventional manner. Remark VYNS vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer available from Union Carbide Corp. Thus, Ion Selective Electrode I for the analysis of sodium ion was prepared. On a silver silver chloride electrode film prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 was coated an aqueous sodium chloride 3 solution. The coated layer was then allowed to stand at room temperature approx. 20 On thus formed electrolyte layer was then coated a sodium ion selective layer in the same manner as in Example 1 to prepare Ion Selective Electrode II for the analysis of sodium ion was prepared. A liquid receiver or a plastic film provided with a couple of liquid receiving openings was fixed onto the surface of the ion selective electrode under adhesion. The two liquid receiving openings are connected to each other with a polyester spun thread bridge. Thus, an electrode device for the analysis of sodium ion was prepared. The electrode device for the sodium ion analytis is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. In Fig, 1, 11 indicates the polyethylene terephthalate film support , each of 12a and 12b indicates the deposited silver metal layer the deposited silver metal layer is devided by the scratched groove to expose the surface of the support, whereby giving two separated areas , each or 13a and 13b indicates the silver chloride layer, 14 indicates the sodium chloride electrolyte layer, 15 indicates the ion selective layer, 16 indicates the liquid receiver, each of 17a and 17b indicates the liquid receiving opening, and 18 indicates the bridge. In one liquid receiving opening 17a was spoteed a sodium ion containing reference solution Calibrate 2 , and in another liquid receiving opening 17b was spotted a liquid sample Calibrate 1, 2 or 3 was employed . In the measurement according to a differential method, the within run precision was measured in the conventional manner. The results are set forth in Table 1. Remark The slope value of Calibrate 1 was 60 mV decade. In the above described measurements, the Electrode I prepared in Example 1 showed no value deviating from the expected value 50 mV even in fifty times repeated runs, while the Electrode II prepared in Comparison Example 1 showed values deviating from the expected value 50 mV in a ratio of 10 times per fifty times repeated runs. The procedures of Example 1 was repeated except that the thickness of the ion selective layer was changed from 20 µm to 25 µm to prepare an ion selective electrode for the analysis of sodium ion Ion Selective Electrode III . The above described evaluation was performed on the Ion Selective Electrode III. The results are almost the same as those given on the Ion Selective Electrode I. On a silver silver chloride electrode film prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 was coated an aqueous sodium chloride 6 solution. The coated layer was then dried by applying an air stream 80 On thus formed electrolyte layer was then coated a sodium ion selective layer 25 µm in the same manner as in Example 1 to prepare Ion Selective Electrode IV for the analysis of sodium ion was prepared. On the Ion Selective Electrode IV was performed the evaluation according to the differential method in the same manner as on the Ion Selective Electrodes I and II. The results are set forth in Table 2. In the above described measurements, the Electrode IV showed no value deviating from the expected value even in fifty times repeated runs. A filmy silver silver chloride electrode reference electrode and the Ion Selective Electrode I for the sodium ion analysis prepared in Example 1 were connected to each other by means of a combination of a liquid receiver and a bridge in the same manner as illustrared in Fig. 1. On the reference electrode was spotted a reference liquid Calibrato 2 , while on the Ion Selective Electrode I was spotted a liquid sample Calibrate 1, 2 or 3 . The variation with time of the potential was measured according to the known direct method. The results are illustrated in Fig. 2. As is clear from Fig. 2, the potential reached to a stable value within a very short time. The measurement by the same direct method as in Example 4 was repeated on the Ion Selective Electrode I for the sodium ion analysis using a liquid sample containing sodium chloride in the amount of 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , or 10.0 . The measured values all were within approx. 200 mV. The similar measurement was performed on the liquid sample containing sodium chloride in an amount of 0.5 or more according to the differential method to give a CV 2.0 3 . On a silver silver chloride electrode film prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 was coated a sodium chloride solution containing 5.95 g. or sodium chloride in a mixture of ethanol 5g. , acetone 40 g. and water 40 g. . The coated layer was then allowed to stand at room temperature to dryness. Thus, a dry electrolyte layer of 2.5 g m² was formed. The microscopic observation indicated that the dried electrolyte layer was composed of a great number of fine sodium chloride crystals having a mean size of approx. 2 3 µm which were uniformly and densely distributed over the silver chloride layer. On thus formed electrolyte layer was then coated a sodium ion selective layer 25 µm in the same manner as in Example 1 using the following composition to prepare Ion Selective Electrode V for the analysis or sodium ion was prepared. The procedures of Example 6 were repeated except that a continuous polyethylene terephthalate PET film length 1000 mm was employed, the coating of the electrolyte solution was performed by means of a continuous coater, and the drying was performed by applying to the coated layer a stream of warm air at 60 On thus formed electrolyte layer was then coated a sodium ion selective layer 25 µm in the same manner as in Example 1 to prepare Ion Selective Electrode VI for the analysis of sodium ion was prepared.

Remark The slope value of every reference liquid was 58.5 mV decade. In the above described measurements, the Electrodes V and VI both showed no value deviating from the expected value 50 mV even in fifty times repeated runs. The Ion Selective Electrodes V and VI were further evaluated according to the direct method described in Example 4. The results are illustrated in Fig. 3. As is apparent from Fig. 3, the potential reached to a stable value within a very short time in both cases. The procedures of Example 7 were repeated except that the solvent of the electrolye NaCℓ was changed to a mixture of 40 g. of methanol and 60 g. of water. Thus, a dry electrolyte layer of 2.5 g m² was formed. The microscopic observation indicated that the dried electrolyte layer was composed of a great number of fine sodium chloride crystals having a mean size of approx. 1 2 µm which were uniformly and densely distributed over the silver chloride layer not only in the width direction but also in the longitudinal direction.
