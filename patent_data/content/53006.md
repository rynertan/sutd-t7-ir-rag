# Two electrode welding method.

## Abstract
In a two electrode welding method wherein welding is carried out by means of arcs struck between two electrodes 11A and 11B and a parent metal 22 . the two electrodes being located in side by side, spaced apart relation in a direction in which the welding surface advances and mov able relative to the parent metal, a portion of the parent metal is preheated by the arc struck between the leading electrode 11A and the parent metal 22 , and a preheated portion 23 is melted by the heat of the arc struck between the trailing electrode 11B and the parent metal 22 when the former has moved to a position above the preheated portion 23 of the latter to provide a deposited metal 14 . The method has particular utility in applications where metal of high heat conductivity. such as copper, is welded.
