# RECEIVER FOR POWER LINE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A dual threshold method and apparatus 109, 111 is used in a coherent phase shift keyed demodulator 14 to distinguish situations in which an incoming carrier signal 30 is expected from those open ended conditions when a receiver is active, but when an incoming signal is not imminently expected. The use of a lower threshold 111 1 permits more rapid detection and demodulation of a valid carrier signal by utilizing a standard which is less strict to determine the presence of a valid carrier signal when an incoming carrier signal is expected.
