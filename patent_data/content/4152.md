# Digitizing a recurring analog signal.

## Abstract
A recurring analog signal is digitized by repeatedly comparing it to a reference level, or to several reference levels, during each signal occurrence to determine where the signal has a value related to each reference level. The reference level, or levels, are changed between signal occurrences but remain constant during each occurrence. Digitization is completed after several occurrences of the signal have been analyzed in this manner.
