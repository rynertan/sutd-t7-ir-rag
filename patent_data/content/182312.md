# Four wheel drive unit.

## Abstract
A four wheel drive unit is provided with a friction clutch interposed between an input shaft and a front wheel output shaft. The clutch is urged toward engagement with an in creasing force as output torque of a rear wheel output shaft increases for thereby increasing engine power transmitted from the input shaft to front road wheels while urged toward disengagement with an incresaing force as steering effort on a steering wheel increases for thereby reducing engine power transmitted from the input shaft to the front road wheels.
