## Description
Method for Treatment of Hypoovarianism This invention relates to a therapeutic means for treatment of hypoovarianism. More particularly, this invention relates to a medicament containing a compound of the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group for treatment of hypoovarianism. Hypoovarianism such as climacteric disturbances, infertility, etc. is caused by a decreased secretion of estrogen hereinafter referred to as E due to hypofunction of the ovary. Climacteric disturbances are the syndrome which develop in females in climacterium approximately at the ages of 45 to 60 as a decreased secretion of E results in changes in various metabolisms of the body which, in turn, affect the diencephalon which is the autonomic nerve center. Manifestations of climacteric disturbances are diverse and include angioneurotic disorder like symptoms such as heat sensation, feeling of cold, hot flash, palpitation, etc., psychoneurotic disorder like symptoms such as headache, dizziness, insomnia, etc, perception disorder symptoms such as numbness, byperesthesia, hypesthesia, etc. locomotorial disorder symptoms such as lumbago, shoulder stiffness, arthralgia, etc. cutaneous secretory disturbance symptoms such as perspiration, dry mouth, etc. obesity, emaciation, climacteric diabetes, senile vaginitis, pruritus cutaneus, fatigue, arteriosclerosis, cardiac disorder and so on For the treatment of these manifestations of climacteric disturbance, therapies using a synthetic E drug or an androgen drug or both of them so as to correct for the decrease in secretion of endogenous ovarian hormone proved successful and were used as therapies of choice against climacteric disturbances In recent years, however, these therapies have not been used as often as in the past because they present the risk of metrorrhagia and carcinogenicity. As other therapies, minor tranquilizers, antidepressants, autonomic blocking agents, peripheral circulation improving agents, chinese medicines, etc. have been administered but their efficacies are not satisfactory as are desired. Infertility, which is said to be present in 5 to 10 percent of all the females of fertile ages approximately up to the early forties , is caused by various causes and includes such cases due to insufficientE secretion as ovarian aplasia, ovulation disorder, uterine aplasia, nidation disorder, early abortion, etc.Against these types of infertility, synthetic 3 drugs and progesterones have been mainly employed.However, these drugs have the disadvantage that responses vary a great deal according to individuals. The present inventors found that the compound of general formula I EMI2.1 hereinafter there may be occasionally referred to as the Compound I and Wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group does not independently have E activity but does potentiateE activity and demonstrated that the compound potentiatesE activity of ovarian origin which has been depressed in patients with climacteric disturbances or infertility, thus being useful for the treatment of these diseases Thus, the principal object of this invention is to provide a method for treatment of hypoovarianism through the mechanims of potentating the activity of E produced endogenously in the human ovary or administered exogenously, which comprises administering to the female the compound of general formula I .Another object of this invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of general formula I , which is usable in the above mentioned method. Ref erring, now, to the above general formula I , the lower alkyl group R may be a straight chain group or a branched chain group, and may for example be methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or pentyl The compound of general formula I can be produced, for example by cyclizing a 2 hydroxy 4 RO substituted phenyl benzyl ketone in the conventional manner and the compound I wherein R is a lower alkyl group can also be produced by alkylating a 7 hydroxy isoflavone. The compound of general formula I which is employed in accordance with this invention is invariably a white to pale yellowish brown crystalline compound which is freely soluble in dimethylformamide and chloroform, soluble in ethanol and acetone, and practically insoluble in water. As will be apparent from acute toxicity text shown hereinafter, the compound of general formula I did not cause death nor toxic symptoms attributable thereto when its technically feasible maximum dose 5,000 to 10,000 mg kg was administered orally or subcutaneously to mice and rats. Thus, the compound of general formula I is only sparingly toxic. Methods for the preparation of compound I are described in the prior art and some species of compound I and related isoflavones are known to be useful as agents for increasing capillary strength French Pharmaceutical PatentNo. 1065 , therapeutic drugs for vascular disorder, inflammation and P hypovitaminosis conditions UnitedStates Patent No. 3352754 , body weight increasing agents United States Patent Nos. 3864362, 4166862 and 4117149 , agents for increasing muscle power, anticatabolic agents and antasthenics United States Patent No. 3864362 , therapeutic drugs for osteoporosis of immobilisation United StatesPatent No. 3907830 , and therapeutic drugs for myocardial or pulmonary insufficiency Japanese Toku Kai Sho 53 133635 , etc. However, nothing is known about the use of the compound as a therapeutic drug for hypoovarianism. The dosage of the compound of general formula I according to this invention for humans is generally about 5 to 10 mg kg day for oral administration, and about 200 to 600 mg can be orally taken daily, once a day or, if necessary, in 2 to 3 divided doses. The compound I is preferably formulated into such dosage forms as tablets, capsules, etc.by the established pharmaceutical procedure. Such tablets and capsules can be prepared using suitable vehicle such as lactose, starch, etc., binders such as hydroxypropylcellulose, and lubricants such as magnesium stearate. The tablets may be sugar coated, if necessary. The following experimental examples show the activity of the compound of general formula I to potentiate E activity. In these examples, the species of the compound of general formula I used were 7 hydroxyisoflavone hereinafter referred to as Compound A and 7 isopropyloxy isoflavone briefly, Compound BJ. Test Example 1E activity potentiating effect of 7 hydroxy isoflavone in young oophorectomized rats Spraque Dawley rats, 33 days of age and 11 days after oophorectomy for elimination of endogenous E activity, were assigned to groups of 5 to 7 individuals and treated subcutaneously with solutions of esterone in sesame oil or orally with suspensions of CompoundA in 1 hydroxypropylcellulose solution, either independently or in combination, for 3 days.On the 4th day, each animal was autopsied and its uterine wet weight was recorded As shown in Table 1, Compound A at 50 and 100 mg kg did not cause an increase of uterine weight but potentiated the uterine weight increasing action of estrone Table 1EMI5.1 tb Daily SEP dose SEP of SEP Daily SEP dose SEP of SEP No SEP of SEP Uterine SEP wet tb estrone SEP Compound SEP A SEP animals SEP weight tb SEP Rg kg SEP mg kg SEP mgiS.I .
