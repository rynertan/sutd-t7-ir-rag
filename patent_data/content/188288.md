# Device and method for effecting application of a therapeutic agent.

## Abstract
A removable programmable element is used to control operation of a delivery unit, which unit delivers a therapeutic agent to a patient. The programmable element is programmed, while removed from the delivery unit, by a computer that is operationally independent of the delivery unit. The delivery unit requires no microprocessor and can include a plurality of channels for effecting independent delivery of therapeutic agents in each channel under the control of the programmable element. The programmable element is programmed with respect to available protocol information, including patient history, needs and tolerances, as well as therapeutic agent parameters, to thereby establish a flow profile that is customized for a particular patient during each moment of each day. Patient demand for therapeutic agents can also be accommodated with safeguards being included to assure proper dispensing of the demanded agents.
