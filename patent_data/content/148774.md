## Description
This invention relates to a polyphenylene ether resin composition having excellent mechanical strength, solvent resistance, oil resistance and moldability. Polyphenylene ethers have superior heat resistance, rigidity and electrical properties and are useful polymeric materials as engineering plastics. It is well known however that the polyphenylene ether resins have the serious defect of suffering from poor solvent resistance, oil resistance and moldability. Known techniques for improving the flow characteristics of the polyphenylene ethers include, for example, the blending of a polystyrene resin with the polyphenylene ethers US A 3,383,435 , and the blending of a rubber reinforced copolymer of a styrene compound and an alpha,beta unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride with the polyphenylene ethers JP A 128947 1977 . These techniques, however, do not at all improve the solvent resistance and oil resistance of the polyphenylene ethers. JP A 50050 1974 discloses a technique of improving the melt flowability of a polyphenylene ether by incorporating a polyester resin into it. Investigations of the present inventors, however, have shown that the incorporation of the polyester resin certainly improved the melt flowability of the polyphenylene ether, but if it is incorporated in an amount of at least 20 based on the resulting composition, the inherent mechanical strengths, especially tensile strength, of the polyphenylene ether are greatly impaired. The incorporation of the polyester resin improves the solvent resistance of the polyphenylene ether, but the degree of improvement of the solvent resistance is nearly proportional to the amount incorporated. Accordingly, a large amount of the polyester resin becomes necessasry in order to impart solvent resistance fully. However, the incorporation of such a large amount of the polyester resin undesirably results in a reduction in the mechanical strength of the resulting resin composition. In any case, the phenomenon of deterioration in the mechanical strength of the polyphenylene ether upon the incorporation of the polyester resin is due to the poor compatibility between the polyphenylene ether and the polyester resin. JP A 179,556 1984 describes a resin composition of improved water absorption comprising a phenoxy resin and a modified polyalkylene terephthalate modified with a polyoxyalkylene compound. Examples of the polyoxyalkylene compound are polyoxyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, polyoxyalkylene compounds containing organic acid metal salts such as a mono or disuccinic ester potassium salt of polyethylene glycol, an epoxy group containing polyoxyalkylene compound such as a mono or di glycidyl ether of polyethylene glycol, and polyoxyalkylene compounds having a hydrocarbon group at the terminal such as methoxypolyethylene glycol. The specification states that the polyoxyalkylene compound improves the moldability of polyalkylene terephthalates but has the defect of increasing moisture absorption, and this defect is removed by incorporation of a phenoxy resin. The specification further discloses that another polymer such as polyolefins, polystyrene or polyphenylene oxide can be further incorporated. It is clear however that the object of the above resin composition lies in the improvement of the moldability of the polyalkylene terephthalate by the polyoxyalkylene compound. According to the invention there is provided a polyphenylene ether resin composition comprising The resin composition of this invention has improved solvent resistance and moldability but retains the excellent mechanical strength of the polyphenylene ether resin.

The resulting polyphenylene ether resin compositions of this invention have better mechanical properties, solvent resistance and moldability than a composition obtained by incorporating only a polyester resin in a polyphenylene ether. The resin composition of this invention has unique properties, and shows markedly improved solvent resistance, mechanical strength, above all tensile strength, and oil resistance over a resin composition not containing the component D . It is not entirely clear why such unique effects are produced in the polyphenylene ether resin compositions of this invention. Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 23, pages 645 659 1979 , for example, states that when a mixture of a polyester resin and a phenoxy resin is heated and kneaded, a chemical linkage is formed between the two resins owing to ester interchange reaction. In view of this statement, it is presumed that in the resin composition of this invention, too, a chemical linkage is formed between the polyester resin and the phenoxy resin at the time of heating and kneading them. Furthermore, at this time, the unsaturated carboxylic acid, the vinyl copoplymer or the polyphenylene ether also participates in the reaction to induce, for example, an esterification reaction between the unsaturated carboxylic acid with the hydroxyl groups of the phenoxy resin, and the radical reaction of the methyl groups of the polyphenylene ether with the unsaturated bond of the unsaturated carboxylic acid which is bonded to the phenoxy resin by the esterification reaction. When the alpha,beta unsaturated dicarboxylic acid is used, the terminal hydroxyl group of the polyphenylene ether and the hydroxyl group of the phenoxy resin would also be linked by ester groups. It is believed therefore that consequently, a blended state not seen in conventional compositions is generated among the polyphenylene ether, the polyester resin, the phenoxy resin and the unsaturated carboxylic acid and or the vinyl copolymer, and leads to the aforesaid unique effects of the resin composition of this invention. The following Examples and Comparative Examples illustrate the polyphenylene ether resin compositions of this invention. A mixture composed of 49 parts by weight of polyethylene terephthalate RE500 , 4 parts by weight of a phenoxy resin PHENOXY RESIN PKHH , and 22 parts by weight of a styrene maleic anhydride copolymer DYLARK 232 sold by ARCO company of U. S. A. a melt index, measured at 200 C under a load of 5 kg, 2.2 g 10 minutes to be abbreviated as SMA resin was melted and mixed at about 300 C and pelletized. Seventy five parts by weight of the resulting pellets and 25 parts by weight of 2,6 dimethylphenol 2,3,6 trimethylphenol copolymer 5 mole of 2,3,6 trimethylphenol having an intrinsic viscosity, measured at 25 C in chloroform as a solvent, of 0.50 dl g were dry mixed, and the mixture was kneaded again at 300 C in an extruder the resulting mixture contained the polyphenylene ether, polyethylene terephthalate, phenoxy resin and SMA resin in a weight ratio of 25 49 4 22 and extruded to form pellets. A dumbbell test specimen, 0.3 cm 1 8 inch thick, was prepared from the resulting pellets by an injection molding machine, and its tensile strength was measured. For evaluating solvent resistance, the pellets were extracted with chloroform by a Soxhlet extractor, and the content of the chloroform insoluble portion was measured. The results are shown in Table 1. It is seen from Table 1 that the amount of the chloroform insoluble portion was greater than the amount of the polyester resin used and also than the total amount of the polyester resin and the phenoxy resin. In view of the fact that the components other than the polyester resin are soluble in chloroform, it is believed that a chemical linkage formed between the polyester resin and the other resin components and contributed to the improvement of the solvent resistance. Example 1 was repeated except that 0.1 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the entire resin components, of 2 phenyl 4 methyl 5 hydroxymethylimidazole was further added as an aid to the composition of Example 1. The results are shown in Table 1. It is seen that a further improvement was achieved in tensile strength and solvent resistance. Example 1 was repeated except that 26 parts by weight of high impact polystyrene containing a polystyrene matrix having an intrinsic viscosity, measured at 25 C in chloroform as a solvent, of 0.89 dl g with a gel content of 16 by weight was used instead of 4 parts by weight of the phenoxy resin and 22 parts by weight of the SMA resin. The results are shown in Table 1. Example 1 was repeated except that the amounts of the polyphenylene ether, polyethylene terephthalate, phenoxy resin and SMA resin were changed respectively to 40, 26, 6 and 8 parts by weight, and 20 parts by weight of the same high impact polystyrene as used in Comparative Example 1 was further added. The results are shown in Table 1. It is seen that a marked improvement was seen in tensile strength and solvent resistance over the compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 2 and 3 to be given hereinafter. Example 3 was repeated except that 0.1 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the entire resin components, of 2 phenyl 4 methyl 5 hydroxymethylimidazole was further added as an aid to the composition of Example 3. The results are shown in Table 1. Forty parts by weight of the same polyphenylene ether as used in Example 1, 26 parts by weight of the same polyethylene terephthalate as used in Example 1 and 34 parts by weight of the same high impact polystyrene as used in Comparative Example 1 were mixed, and by using an extruder melted at 300 C, mixed and pelletized. Test samples were prepared from the resulting pellets by the same procedure as in Example 1, and the same tensile strength measurement and extraction test as in Example 1 were carried out. The results are shown in Table 1. The same procedure as in Example 4 was repeated except that the SMA resin was not used, and the amount of the high impact polystyrene was changed to 28 parts by weight. The results are shown in Table 1. A mixture composed of 41.1 parts by weight of polybutylene terephthalate to be abbreviated as PBT N 1000, a product of Mitsubishi Rayon Co., Ltd. DSC melting point about 230 C, 4.6 parts by weight of a phenoxy resin PHENOXY RESIN PKHH and 2.3 parts by weight of maleic anhydride was melted and mixed at 200 to 260 C and pelletized. Forty eight parts by weight of the resulting pellets, 32 parts by weight of 2,6 dimethylphenol 2,3,6 trimethylphenol copolymer 5 mole of 2,3,6 trimethylphenol having an intrinsic viscosity, measured at 25 C in chloroform as a solvent, of 0.52 dl g, and 20 parts by weight of glass fibers CSO3MA429 1 , a product of Asahi Fiberglass Co., Ltd. were melted and kneaded at 280 C by using an extruder the resulting mixture contained the polyphenylene ether, PBT, phenoxy resin maleic anhydride and glass fibers in a weight ratio of 32 41.1 4.6 2.3 20 to form pellets. A dumbbell test specimen, 0.3 cm 1 8 inch thick, was prepared from the pellets by means of an injection molding machine, and its tensile strength was measured. To evaluate solvent resistance, the pellets were extracted with chloroform by a Soxhlet extractor, and the amount of the chloroform insoluble portion was measured. The results are shown in Table 2. It is seen from Table 2 that the amount of the chloroform insoluble portion was larger than the amount of the polyester resin used and also than the total amount of the polyester resin and the phenoxy resin, and also than the total amount of the polyester resin, the phenoxy resin and maleic anhydride. Thus even a portion of the polyphenylene ether became insoluble in chloroform. In view of the fact that the components other than the polyester resin are soluble in chloroform, the above results are believed to mean that a chemical linkage formed between the polyester resin and the other resin components and contributed to the improvement of solvent resistance and mechanical strength. Example 5 was repeated except that maleic anhydride was not used, and the amounts of PBT and the phenoxy resin were changed respectively to 43.2 and 4.8 parts by weight.
