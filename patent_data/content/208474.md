## Description
This invention relates to automotive sound systems, and particularly to a system which employs psychoacoustic contouring of the program material signal, based upon the hearing characteristics of the human ear. It has long been known that the apparent response of the human ear is dependent upon how loud program material is, and the frequency of that program material. For example, it is known that, at low program material loudness levels, low frequency program material is much lower in apparent volume than higher frequency program material. As loudness level increases, the apparent difference in loudness between equal amplitude low frequency program material signals and high frequency program material signals diminishes. Equalization based upon the so called Fletcher Munson characteristics, or some other characteristics has been utilized in the past. Another set of differential loudness contours, the Stephens differential loudness contours, is also known. Invariably, in the design of an audio system for an automotive vehicle, certain compromises are made. The acoustic environment of an automobile is a unique environment. It is small, fully enclosed and relatively noisy. There are surfaces in the vehicle that are highly absorptive, such as car seats, padded dashboards and headliners. There are surfaces in a car that are highly reflective, such as window glass. There are size and placement constraints on the choice of loudspeakers to play within the environment of an automobile. Certain design advantages, however, are available in the automotive sound system environment.For example, the designer knows generally where the occupants of the car are going to be seated. Therefore, specific equalization of a system at the intended location of the listener s ear can be achieved. The relatively small enclosed space of an automobile interior can be used to good advantage in terms of bandwidth with proper system design. One demand for a high quality automotive sound system is that the bandwidth of the system be as wide as possible. Much musical information otherwise can be masked or lost in a system that is wmidrange heavy, has acoustic dips or notches , or does not reproduce high or low frequencies with maximum fidelity. To deal with the sound absorption characteristics of an automobile interior, it is essential when designing an automotive sound system to address the true sound power generated by the speakers mounted in the automobile. Since speakers generally become more directional as frequency of program material increases, the sound power radiated as frequency increases is radiated in a narrower and narrower beam.The contributions of off axis sound pressure response become more and more critical as speaker mounting location considerations restrict the ideal placement of speakers. A problem associated with speaker choice in the automobile environment and elsewhere is the mounting of midrange speakers and woofers in close proximity to each other. Distortion due to modulation becomes a problem under these circumstances. In accordance with the present invention, in a sound system comprising a source of program material, a first transducer, and means for coupling the first transducer to the source to produce an audible signal related to the program material, the improvement comprises a variable bass contour control network, a power amplifier, a second transducer and a control circuit. Means are provided for coupling the variable bass contour control network to the program material source. Additional means are provided for coupling the power amplifier to the variable bass contour control network. Further means are provided for coupling the second transducer and the control circuit to the power amplifier.The control circuit is coupled to the variable bass contour control network, the control circuit controlling the contour of the signal supplied from the program material source through the variable bass contour control network to the power amplifier based upon the signal provided by the power amplifier to the control circuit. According to an illustrative embodiment of the invention, the power amplifier comprises a pair of output terminals and the means for coupling the second transducer and control circuit to the power amplifier comprises means for coupling the second transducer and control in parallel across the output terminals. Further according to an illustrative embodiment, the variable bass contour control network comprises a light sensitive resistor, the control circuit comprises a light emitting device, and the control circuit is coupled to the variable bass contour control network by coupling light from the light emitting device to the light sensitive resistor. Additionally, according to an illustrative embodiment, the control circuit further comprises a low pass filter, means for coupling the low pass filter across the output terminals, a rectifier, means for coupling the rectifier across the low pass filter, means for storing the rectified voltage variations appearing across the rectifier, means for coupling the storage means to the rectifier and current limiting means for coupling the light emitting device across the storage means to limit the light output from the light emitting device for a given stored energy in the storage means. Illustratively, the variable bass contour control network comprises a bass boost circuit, a notch filter, a band pass filter and a low frequency boost attenuator. Additionally, according to the invention the source of program material has a plurality of output channels, and there are an equal plurality of first mentioned transducers, variable bass contour control networks, power amplifiers, second transducers and control circuits. According to an illustrative embodiment, there are four each of said output channels, said first mentioned transducers, said variable bass contour control networks, said power amplifiers, said second transducers and said control circuits. The system of the present invention comprises four speaker amplifier modules used in conjunction with an electronically tunable radio ETR head end. The system of the present invention utilizes four high frequency and four low frequency transducers. Each low frequency tranducer has a separate amplifier in a quasi biamplification mode. The four high frequency output channels illustratively are the ETR s four channels right front, left front, right rear and left rear . The low frequency channels tap directly into respective high frequency channels between the ETR output and the respective channel s high frequency transducer. As used herein, high frequency transducer includes each of the four mid woofer tweeter combinations which ordinarily accompany an ETR when an automotive vehicle is provided with an ETR. The four low frequency amplifiers and transducers which the present invention adds to the normal complement of speakers which accompany the ETR are mounted in the automotive vehicle adjacent the original equipment speakers, and extend the bass response of the original equipment sound system. Each bass control amplifier is a high level, class B, bridge type audio amplifier with closed loop loudness compensation control. The amplifier, designed specifically for automotive sound applications, operates from the vehicle s supply voltage, illustratively 12VDC, has a maximum current capacity of 4.5 amperes and operates into a load of 3.2 ohms to 16 ohms. The amplifier is internally protected against excess voltage and current. The amplifier can provide 15 watts RMS output power into a 4 ohm load in a frequency range of 20 Hz 20 KHz with less than .5 total harmonic distortion. The loudness control, which forms a part of each bass control amplifier is provided to enhance the sound quality available from the original equipment ETR and its associated complement of speakers at lower signal levels. That is, the loudness control is designed to provide Stephens differential loudness contour compensation in the output of the bass control and to overcome noise masking in the automotive vehicle environment. Thus, the bass control amplifier for each of the four channels according to the present invention comprises a basic class B bridge type audio amplifier1 a power supply filter which operates from the 12 VDC automotive vehicle supply to reduce supply transients and ripple, an input equalization network which provides the desired frequency response characteristics, including bass boost, notch filter characteristic, band pass characteristic and a low frequency boost attenuation network, and the control circuitry which controls the frequency and level of the control voltage for Stephens differential loudness contour and noise masking compensation. The invention may best be understood by referring to the following description and accompanying drawings which illustrate the invention. In the drawings Fig. 1 illustrates a partly block and partly schematic diagram of a system constructed according to the invention Fig. 2 illustrates a partly block and partly schematic diagram of a portion of the system illustrated in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 illustrates the frequency response of a system constructed according to the present invention and Fig. 4 illustrates a partly block and partly schematic diagram of another embodiment of a portion of the system illustrated in Fig. 1. As best illustrated in Fig. 1, a block diagram of a system constructed according to the present invention, the system includes an electronically tunable radio ETR , such as the Model 4311 103 ultimate radio available from Chrysler Corporation. ETR 20 provides four output channels, illustratively, right front RF , left front LF , right rear RR and left rear to . These output channels of the ETR 20 drive directly four speaker assemblies 22, 24, 26, 28, respectively, from channels RF, LF, RR, LR. The signals in the output channels of the ETR 20 are also coupled to input terminals of bass control amplifiers 30, 32, 34, 36, respectively. The output terminals of bass control amplifiers 30, 32, 34, 36 are coupled to respective bass speaker assemblies 38, 40, 42, 44. The system of Fig. 1 thus provides biamplification, with additiorll bass contouring, for the program material in the output channels RF, LF, RR, LR of ETR 20. An examination of Fig. 2 will aid in understanding this biamplification and further contouring of the bass program material in the respective channels. Fig. 2 illustrates a partly block and partly schematic diagram of one of the amplifiers 30, 32, 34, 36, illustratively amplifier 30. It is to be understood that four such channels would be provided in a complete four channel system. An input terminal 46 of this amplifier, illustratively, amplifier 30, is coupled through a series circuit including a resistor 48, a 10K resistor 50 and a 1 uF capacitor 52 to an input terminal, pin 6, of a power amplifier integrated circuit 54.Illustratively, integrated circuit 54 is a type uPC1230H2 amplifier available from NEC. The pin numbers given in this description are for such an amplifier, although it is to be understood that any other suitable amplifier can be used. A series RC circuit, including a capacitor 56 and a resistor 58 is coupled in parallel with the series components 48, 50, 52. A capacitor 60 is coupled in parallel with resistor 48. A capacitor 62 is coupled from the common terminal of resistor 48, resistor 50 and capacitor 60 to ground. A light sensitive resistor 64 is coupled between pin 6 of integrated circuit 54 and ground. A parallel RC circuit including a resistor 61 and a capacitor 63 is also coupled between pin 6 and ground. Power is supplied from an unregulated 12 16 VDC supply, such as an automobile battery, through a .1 mH choke 66 to the power supply terminal, pin 9 of integrated circuit 54. A 100 uF capacitor 66 is coupled between pin 9 and ground. A 50 uF capacitor 70 is coupled between pin 8 of integrated circuit 54 and ground. A 1.5K resistor 72 is coupled between pins 3 and 11 of integrated circuit 54. A 100 uF capacitor 74 is coupled between pins 3 and 5 of integrated circuit 54. A 100 uF capacitor 76 is coupled between pins 1 and 2 of integrated circuit 54.A 100 uF capacitor 77 and an 18 ohm resistor 78 are coupled in series between pins 3 and 4 of integrated circuit 54. A 3.3K resistor 80 is coupled between pin 1 of integrated circuit 54 and the common terminal of capacitor 77 and resistor 78. Pins 7 and 12 of integrated circuit 54 are coupled to ground. A bass speaker assembly, illustratively, speaker assembly 38, is coupled across the output terminals, pins 1 and 11 of integrated circuit 54. Each of pins 1 and 11 is coupled to ground through a series RC circuit including a .1 uF capacitor 82 and a 1 ohm resistor 84 on pin 1 and a .1 uF capacitor 86 and a 1 ohm resistor 88 on pin 11 .These circuits shunt high frequency oscillations in the voltages across terminals 1, 11. A 100 uF capacitor 90 is coupled between pins 10 and 11 of integrated circuit 54. A frequency and level control qenerator for loudness compensation includes a series RC circuit coupled across the speaker assembly 38 terminals of integrated circuit 54. This circuit includes a series 100 ohm resistor 92 and a 22 uF capacitor 94. A full wave bridge rectifier including diodes 96 99 is coupled across capacitor 94. A 47 uF capacitor 100 is coupled across the diode 96 99 bridge to store the rectified voltage variations appearing across capacitor 94. A 10K resistor 102 in parallel with a series circuit including a light emitting diode LED 104 and a current limiting resistor 106 is coupled across capacitor 100. LED 104 is positioned close to light sensitive resistor 64.The rectified voltage variations appearing across capacitor 94, and thus, the voltage variations above the cutoff frequency of the RC circuit comprising components 92, 94 appearing across the output terminals, pins 1 and 11 of integrated circuit 54, determine the resistance of light sensitive resistor 64. The cutoff frequency is determined by the values of resistor 92 and capacitor 94. The greater the amplitude of the low frequency components of the program material amplified by integrated circuit 54, the greater will be the rectified voltage appearing across capacitor 100, and therefore, the greater will be the light emitted by diode 104. The greater the light emitted by diode 104, the lower will be the resistance of light sensitive resistor 64. The lower the resistance of light sensitive resistor 64, the higher will be the frequency of the components of the signal appearing at input terminal 46 which reaches pin 6, the input terminal, of integrated circuit 54. The loudness control provided by components 92, 94, 96 100, 102, 104, 106 and 64 enhances the sound quality at lower signal levels, that is, as determined by the Stephens differential loudness contours, and the level of noise masking in the automobile environment.As illustrated in Fig. 3, for low level signals less than 2v at 1 KHz , the responses of these signals rise below about 400 Hz. As the signal level increases, e.g., 3v 8v at 1 KHz, the amount of low frequency boost boost below 400 Hz is less. At the maximum power output of the integrated circuit 54 at 8v the response is nearly flat. In fact, the low frequencies below about 200 Hz, are cut at high levels e.g., 8v . This limits speaker 38 Tone excursion to minimize distortion. The circuit including components 48, 50, 52, 56, 5E. 60, 61, 62, 63, 64 and 106 provides input equali. tion and the desired frequency response charactristics.

The rectified voltage variations appearing across capacitor 194, and thus, the voltage variations above the cutoff frequency of the RC circuit comprising components 192, 194 appearing across the output terminals, pins 1 and 11, of integrated circuit 154, determine the resistance of light sensitive resistor 164. The cutoff frequency is determined by the values of resistor 192 and capacitor 194. The greater the amplitude of the low frequency components of the program material amplified by integrated circuit 154, the greater will be the rectified voltage appearing across capacitor 200, and therefore, the greater will be the light emitted by diode 204.

As illustrated in Fig. 3, for low level signals less than 2v at 1 KHz , the responses of these signals rise below about 400 Hz. As the signal level increases, e.g., 3v 8v at 1 KHz, the amount of low frequency boost boost below 400 Hz is less. At the maximum power output of the integrated circuit 154 at 8v the response is nearly flat. In fact, the low frequencies below about 200 Hz, are cut at high levels e.g., 8v .
