# IMPROVED POLYIMIDE PRODUCTS

## Abstract
Novel polyimide products of general formula II n 2 to 20, each R H or a group effective to block further reactions by diamines are incapable of further polymerisation with diamines, but are useful starting materials for reaction with other polyfunctional reagents such as diepoxides for form interesting new resins.
