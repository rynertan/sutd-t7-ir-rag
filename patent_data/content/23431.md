# Processes for the production of carrier particles from yeast cells and for producing diagnostic reagents therefrom carrier particles and diagnostic reagent produced thereby and test kit containing such reagents.

## Abstract
Yeast cells are converted into carrier particles useful as carriers for proteins and other materials useful in agglutina tion tests by cross linking the proteins of the cell cytoplasm followed by stabilization of the carbohydrates of the cell wall by reaction with an epoxide. The stabilized cells obtained may be dyed and may be esterified or etherified to block the hydroxyl groups in their surfaces. They may be coupled to the protein or other material by activation, e.g. with cyanuric chloride, followed by reaction with the protein or other mat erial to produce diagnostic agents useful in test kits.
