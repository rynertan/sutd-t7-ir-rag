# Sheet binding apparatus.

## Abstract
An adhesive binding apparatus is disclosed for edge binding multiple sets of sheet material held in a stack of multiple trays. The binding apparatus includes an adhesive transfer belt 22 fabricated from a non metallic synthetic fiber movable between a retracted position out of contact with the edges of the multiple sets of sheet material and an adhesive application position for transfer of the adhesive on the belt onto edges of the sets of sheet material. The endless belt extends through an adhesive dispenser 24 mounted to a transfer frame 26. A belt aligning assembly 34 aligns the belt relative to the aligned edges of the multiple sets of sheet material for transfer of the adhesive thereto. The alignment assembly centers the frontside of the belt coated with adhesive so that it is parallel to a plane extending along the edges of the multiple sets of sheet material. The alignments assembly includes a belt aligning bar 38 and adjustable belt aligning stops 42. An adhesive metering assembly 54 is also provided for metering a continuous strip of adhesive from the adhesive dispenser onto the transfer belt of narrower width than the width of the belt so that the adhesive does not migrate to the backside of the belt.
