# Monitored delivery systems.

## Abstract
A liquid fuel pump nozzle 11 carries an optical bar code reader 20 . A vehicle fuel reservoir has an entry port 10 pro vided with an optical bar code strip 14 having bars 15 ex tending circumferentially of the port so that the bars are axially spaced. The reader thus reads the optical code during receiv ing movement of the nozzle into the entry port. The data reader and data provider may both be data transceivers. A compara tor 44 compares data from the reader 20, 40 with data from a data source 49 , and optionally also with data from a credit card security system 56 to determine whether that vehicle is authorised to receive fuel, and an interlock 50 connected to the comparator to prevent fuel delivery in the absence of a sig nal from the comparator.
