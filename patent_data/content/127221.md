# Concrete foundation pile and device for driving the same into the ground.

## Abstract
Concrete foundation pile comprising an elongate body, a screwthread element extending helically over a considerable part of the length of the pile, an engaging surface for transfer ring a couple to the body is formed by the bounding surface of a cavity extending in mainly this part of the pile. The cavity has a substantially constant cross section. The pile can consist of a number of pile sections lengthwise arranged with their end surfaces one against the other. The invention furthermore relates to a device for driving such a foundation pile into the ground, comprising a rod shaped element capable of engag ing in the cavity. This rod shaped element can comprise a drilling point capable of protruding out of a foundation pile provided with a throughgoing cavity.
