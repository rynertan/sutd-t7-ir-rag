## Abstract
In the frequency control mode, a switch 23 is ON. A power difference ΔP is fed back to an adder 18 through a limiter 21 and is compared with an output from a power setter 9a . A difference signal Pdp from the adder 18 is supplied to an adder 19 to obtain a difference ΔP with detected power Pd . By the feedback loop, the preset power Pdp is set to be substantially equal to the detected power Pd . While the difference ΔP is greater than a predeter mined value, an output from a level detector 22 is at logic level 0 . Even if a mode switch instruction is received in this state, an AND gate 24 does not produce an output signal and the mode changing is not performed.
