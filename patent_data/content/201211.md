## Description
METHOD AND COMPOSITIONS FOR VISUAL SOLID PHASE IMMUNOASSAYS BASED ON LUMINESCENT MICROSPHERIC PARTICLESTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates generally to assay methods and compositions for the detection of antibodies, haptens, antigens and other substances of interest in fluid samples. More specifically, the invention relates to visual immunoassay methods and compositions utilizing luminescent microspheres.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many assay procedures have been used to qualitatively and quantitatively determine the occurrence of a wide variety of analytes in biological fluids and other samples. These assay procedures typically exploit a relatively specific affinity between the analyte of interest and a reactant e.g., enzyme substrate, antibody antigen, etc. , at least one of which is labeled with a reporter substance i.e., one whose presence, either alone or in complex with another substance, is easily detected . Following mixture of the reactant with the sample and incubation, specific analyte reactant interactions occur forming analyte reactant complexes. The reaction mixture is subsequently analyzed to detect free and specificallybound reactant, enabling detection and measurement of the analyte in the sample.Such facile detection is often accomplished with the use of a reporter capable of emitting some type of a signal such as a chromophore, an enzyme, a radioisotope, a luminescent substance, or an optically active substance. Typical analytes include microorganisms, metabolites, proteins, drugs, vitamins, hormones and other substances. These analytes usually occur in minute concentrations and their detection requires assay procedures with corresponding sensitivities. Assay procedures can be divided into two general categories, homogeneous and heterogeneous. In a homogeneous assay, the signal emitted by the specifically bound labeled reactant is different from the signal emitted by the free labeled reactant. Hence, the bound and free forms can be distinguished without physical separation. The archetypal homogeneous assay is the enzymemultiplied immunoassay technique EMIT . The substrate labeled fluorescent immunoassay is another homogenous assay Burd, J.F. et al., 1977 Clin. Chem. 23 1402 Burd, J.F. et al., 1977 Anal. Biochem.77 56 and Kohen, F. et al., 1979 J. SteroidBiochem., 11 161 . Homogeneous assays have the advantage of being rapid, easy to perform, and readily amenable to automation. Their principal disadvantages are that they are relatively prone to interferences, are generally applicable only to low molecular weight analytes, and are limited in sensitivity to approximately 10 M. These disadvantages are significant in a clinical setting where the analyte of interest is a high molecular weight macromolecule or pathogenic microorganism. Further, many analytes of interest are present in biological fluids in very minute concentrations and may go undetected by such homogeneous assay techniques. In a heterogeneous assay, the signal emitted by the specifically bound labeled reactant is indistinguishable from the signal emitted by the free labeled reactant. Therefore, a separation step is required to distinguish the two, involving expenditures of time and labor. However, they are in general more sensitive than homogeneous assays and less prone to interference, since interfering substances can be removed in the washing steps. Typical heterogeneous assays include the radioimmunoassay RIA , the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA and fluoroimmunoasays FIA . Of these assays, RIA and ELISA, although sufficiently sensitive to detect small amounts of analyte, suffer from several drawbacks. For example,RIA presents radiation hazards to the operator, requires special licensing from regulatory agencies and utilizes reagents which have relatively short shelf life. ELISA requires a determination of enzymatic activity which prolongs the assay and adds to its costs and complexity. In addition, RIA and ELISA require highly trained and skilled technicians to perform the assay and relatively expensive instruments to evaluate the results of the assay. The luminescent immunoassays have the capability to address most of the drawbacks described above but are, in general, described to be less sensitive thanRIA and ELISA. However, while this may be true for the serum based homogenous assays, where the Rayleigh andRaman scattering caused by the high protein content in the solution and the intrinsic fluorescence from certain amino acids residue reduces the signal tobackground ratio, it is not necessarily true for the heterogenous assays. One promising heterogenous technique involves the use of a solid support e.g., paper disk, plastic dip stick, walls of the test tube and glass or plastic beads to which an antibody or antigen is absorbed or covalently bonded. This immunoreactive solid surface is then exposed to serum and labeled ligand. The latter react immunologically with the antigen antibody complex on the solid surface. After a brief wash to remove unreacted serum and unbound labeled ligand, the signal from the antigenantibody complex on the solid phase is measured by, e.g., a fluorometer or a simple light box. There has been continuing interest in further improving the sensitivity of heterogenous luminescent immunoassays. Furthermore, there is a need for developing simpler and more efficient heterogenous luminescent immunoassays which will not require a highly skilled technician to perform. Such assays should measure a wide variety of analytes and provide quantitative or qualitative results employing only simple, inexpensive instrumentation or by simple visual inspection. These improvements will ensure a more rapid and widespread adaptation of such luminescent immunoassays in cost conscious laboratories. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide an improved heterogenous luminescent immunoassay which is capable of quantitatively or qualitatively detecting the presence of low concentrations of an analyte in a sample. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method to visually detect the presence of an analyte in a sample. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an assay reactant capable of intensifying the signal produced in heterogenous luminescent immunoassays, such that even minute amounts of an analyte may be visually detected.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a graph comparing visual and fluorometric readings of the results of an assay forCytomegalovirus utilizing a method of the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Methods are disclosed for detecting the presence of sub nanomolar quantities of an analyte of interest.in a sample wherein the sample is exposed to a reactant having an affinity for the analyte,or a complex containing the analyte, to bind with the reactant. The reactant of the present invention comprises microspheric particles labeled with a reporter substance capable of being detected either alone, in complex, or both, and said microspheres further labeled with a substance also having an affinity for the analyte or a complex containing the analyte. The detection of the presence of the analyte is made by visually determining the association with the analytereactant complexes.BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT. THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, samples may be simply and inexpensively assayed for the presence of analytes. The samples may be solutions directly or indirectly derived from virtually any source including biological sources such as cell cultures, tissues, feces, saliva, urine, blood and other fluids. The method depends upon incorporating a substance whose presence is detectable by the emission of signals hereinafter reporter in large numbers into polymeric microspheric particles to intensify the signals emitted. The reporter substance is distributed throughout the microspheric matrix and may be composed of any luminescent substance, preferably a fluorophore.These microspheres can themselves be labeled with a reactant having an affinity for the analyte of interest or a complex thereof and thereby signal the presence of the analyte by associating with it. Where the reporter is a luminescent substance, a simple fluorometer or a light box with simplified optics may be used to visually detect the presence of the analyte. The microspheres may conveniently be spherical in shape and could vary in size from 0.1 to 10 microns.These could be made from any suitable water insoluble polymeric material which, desirably reduces nonspecific binding with substances expected to be present in a sample such as polystyrene, a latex polymer.Other latex polymers, both homopolymers produced by the copolymerization of a single type of monomer, e.g., polystyrene and polyvinyltoulene and copolymers produced by the polymerization of more than one type of monomer, e.g., styrene divinylbenzene, styrenebutadiene, vinyltoluene t butylstyrene, and styrenevinylcarboxylic acid may be useful in the construction of polymeric microspheres. The polymerization process itself is a complex chemical phenomenon, the mechanism of which has been the subject of several studies. Essentially, the polymerization process may be made to occur in an emulsion process with an emulsifier producing latex particles smaller than 3 microns, through a seeded emulsion process producing particles 3 microns or more in diameter, or through an emulsifier free process. The emulsion polymerization process requires a monomer, water, an emulsifying surface active agent such as potassium laurate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, or sodium dihexysulfosuccinate, and a free radicalinitiating agent such as potassium persulfate or hydrogen peroxide. The polymerization process involves a particle nuclear initiation phase and a subsequent particle growth phase. In preparing for the reaction, the monomer is first emulsified in water with the surfdce active agent, forming soap micelles. The free radical initiating agent is then added and the emulsion is heated, decomposing the initiator and releasing radicals which, according to some investigators, begin forming particle nuclei in the soap micelles of the suspension.The reaction process involves the initiation particle nuclear phase in which the radicals react with the monomer to create oligomeric radicals, which then further combine with excess monomer to create the polymer. The resulting suspended latex particles have on their surface fixed functional groups, such as amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, sulfate or amido groups, depending upon the monomer used in the polymerization process. Other functional groups, derived mainly from the emulsifying agent, may be loosely adsorbed to the latex particle surface.These nonfixed groups are removed by mixed bed ion exchange, dialysis or other separation methods. In the seeding emulsion polymerization process, which is used to obtain latex particles of 3 microns or greater, the monomer, added to an existing suspension of latex particles, enters these particles, causing them to swell in size. In the emulsifier free process, a highly concentrated persulfate initiating reagent, a phosphate or carbonate buffer solution, and polymerization at a near neutral pH are used to produce a polymeric latex tat requires no emulsifier removal step, and which can therefore be used directly. The number of particles formed in the emulsion of polymerization process depends upon the concentration of the emulsifying agent and the availability of the free radicals that are generated. The size of the particles depends upon the availability of the monomer, and is inversely proportional to the concentration of the free radical initiating reagent. A representative, but by no means exhaustive, list of suitable luminescent substances is set forth in U.S.Patent No. 4,256,836 to Zuk et al. Preferably, the luminescent substance should have primary function alities as those of xanthene, a fluorophore. However, they may fall into a variety of other groups having other primary functionalities such as 1 and 2aminonaphthalene P,p diaminostilbenes pyrenes quaternary phenanthridine salts 9 aminoacridines p,p diaminobenzophenone imines anthracenes oxacarbocyanine merocyanine 3 aminoequilenin perylene bis benzoxazole bis p oxazolyl benzene 1,2 benzophenazin retinol bls 3 aminopyridinium salts hellerbrigenin tetracycline sterophenol benzimidazolyphenylamine 2 oxo 3 chromen indole 7hydroxycoumarin 4,5 benzimidazoles 2,3 dihydro 1,4napthalazinedione 2,4,5 triphenylimidazole phenoxazine salicylate strophanthidin porhyrins triarylmethanes flavin and rare earth chelates etc. The microspheres will also be labeled with a substance having an affinity for the analyte or a complex containing the analyte, such as antigen or antibody. The selected substance is immobilized on the surface of the microsphere by simple absorption or by complex coupling via one of a variety of functional groups on the surface of the microspheres. Use of similar microspheric particles is disclosed in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,853,987, 4,108,972 and 4,224,198 and K.E. Hechemy et al., Latex Particle Assays in LaboratoryMedicine. Part I., Laboratory Management June, 1984 , 27 40, A variety of protocols can be used to perform the present invention. In general, the method of the present invention comprises bringing together in a medium 1 a solid phase immobilized substance having affinity for said analyte, 2 the sample containing the analyte, and 3 a reagent comprising luminescent labeled microspheres coated with a substance having an affinity for the analyte or a complex containing the analyte. Thus, an embodiment of the present invention utilizes a one step competitive binding assay where solid phase immobilized analyte is brought in contact.with a mixture of sample suspected of containing the analyte, and the assay reagent. After a brief incubation, the unhound reagent is washed off and the reagent bound to the solid surface is detected. In another embodiment of the present invention involving a heterogeneous assay procedure, the presence of an analyte may be detected by sandwich type assay.The substance having an affinity for the analyte of interest is applied onto a solid support substrate to facilitate separation of the complexes to be assayed from the remaining unreacted materials. The coated substrate is then exposed to a sample suspected of containing the analyte of interest under conditions which allow the analyte to associate and form complexes with the reactant fixed onto the solid phase. The associated and unassociated analyte fractions are then separated and the signal emitting microspheres are applied to the analyte reactant complexes. The presence of the analyte is determined by detecting the presence of signal emitting microspheres on the substrate. Yet another embodiment of the present invention employs the avidin biotin interaction. In this embodiment, biotinylated anti human protein is exposed to the analyte reactant complex under conditions which allow the biotinylated anti human protein to associate with the analyte reactant complex. The biotinylated anti human protein associated with the analyte reactant complex is then separated from the unreacted biotinylated anti human protein. The signal containing microsphere is labeled with avid in and applied to the biotinylated association. The presence of the analyte of interest is determined by detecting the presence of the biotinylated association on the substrate as indicated by the presence of signal emitting microspheres on the substrate. The method of the present invention may be used to visually detect the presence of a variety of analytes or analyte complexes, even those that are typically found in serum in low concentrations such as haptens, antibodies and antigens. A representative, but by no means exhaustive, list of such analytes and antibodies against and antigens derived from various substances and organisms is set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,256,834 to Zuk et al. and complexes thereof.The method is particularly suited for the visual detection of the presence of antibodies against and or antigens derived from Herpes, Toxoplasma, Varcella zoster, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr, Treponema, Rubella, Mycoplasma,Brucella, Gonorrhea, Hepatitis, Rotorvirus, Chlamydia,Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Streptococcus, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Influenza A and B,Parainfluenza, Salmonella, Hemophilus influenzae, HumanTumor Leukemia Virus, Canine Heart Worm, Canine PavroVirus, Feline Leukemia Virus, Feline InfectiousPeritonitis, Bovine Brucellosis, Avian InfectiousBronchitis, Swine Psuedo Rabies, New Castle DiseaseVirus, Swine Rotovirus, interferon, amphetamines, cannabinoids, methaqualone, barbituates, cocaine metabolites, opiates, benzodiazepine, methadone and phenylcyclidine. The method of the present invention may also be used in homogeneous assay procedures where unreacted microspheres may be distinguished from those complexed with the analyte of interest. In such procedures, a substrate would not be necessary. EXPERIMENTAL Preparation of Anti Human IgG Coated Fluorescent Microspheres A commercially available fluorescent latex bead preparation, SW 07, Carolina Chemical Company,Charlotte, N. Carolina was used in the experiments described below. The beads were approximately 4 microns, had excitation maxima at 536 and emission maxima at 587 and were coated with goat anti human IgG or IgM using the standard glutaraldehyde technique. Light Box The light box, for visual readings, was made from 0.125 thick aluminum metal dimensions 14 long, 12 high and 7.5 deep which was painted black. An opening into the light box was covered with black rubber to facilitate entry into the box, while excluding extraneous light. The box was fitted with a tungsten lamp General Electric, BDK, 100W which was covered with a metal film, band pass interference filter to reduce the background light. According to the manufacturer s specifications, this filter transmits approximately 60 of the total emittance of light source at 540 nm 10,no band width . To further reduce the background light, the viewing window was covered with a transparent cellulose acetate color filter 0.01 thick which transmitted no light at 540 nm and 50 of the total emittance of light at 590 nm.The critical wavelength range, of course, will depend upon the reagents used. Preparation of Antigens The antigens used in the examples described hereinbelow were prepared in the following manner 1. Rubella Antigen The rubella antigen was prepared by growing Vero D cells in roller bottles containing Eagles minimum essential medium and 5 newborn calf serum for eight days. The confluent monolayers were infected with rubella virus strain HPV 77 and 48 hours after the infection the bottles were harvested daily for five days. The cell debris was removed by low speed centrifugation. The clarified viral antigen was concentratedr centrifuged at low speed to remove any residual debris and loaded onto a sucrose gradient 35 and 45 w w . The gradient was centrifuged at 25,000RPM for 16 20 hours at 8 C in the Beckman L8 55 ultracentrifuge.The viral bands were collected and checked for purity by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.2. Cytomegalovirus Antigen The antigen for the Cytomegalovirus assay was purchased from Viral Antigen Inc. of Tennessee.According to the manufacturer s specifications the antigen was produced by infecting cells withCytomegalovirus strain AD 169. The infected cells were then extracted with glycine buffer to recover the antigen.3. Herpes.simplex Antigen The antigen for the Herpes simplex virus assay was also purchased from Viral Antigen Inc. of Tennessee.According to the manufacturer s specification, the antigen was produced by infecting Vero cells withHerpes simplex virus McIntyre strain. The infected celS were sonicated and extracted with glycine buffer to recover the antigen. 4. Toxoplasma Antigen The antigen substrate for the Toxoplasma assay was purchased from Alicrobiological Research Corporation and consisted of Toxoplasma gondii strain RH, harvested from peritonial fluid of infected mice. To obtain the soluble antigen, the suspension was diluted 1 20 withPBS and sonicated at 4 C for nine minutes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 C to. remove insoluble particulate material. The supernatant was separated from the pellet by careful pipeting.5. Treponema pallidum Antigen The Treponema pallidum antigen was supplied byDavid Cox of Texas College of Ostopathic Medicine,Forth Worth, Texas. According to the supplier s specification, the antigen was propagated in a cell culture comprised of cottontail rabbit epithelium cells Sf1Ep . The Treponema pallidum cells were separated from the cell cultures by centrifugation and sonicated in PBS prior to adsorbing on the solid phase. 6. Alpha Interferon Antigen The dlpha interferon was supplied by Dr. KarlThomae GmbH of West Germany. According to the supplier s specifications, interferon was induced in serum free medium with sendai virus strain cantell in butyrate treated cells. The two cell lines used NAMALIVA Clone 8 and NC 37 were both derived fromBurkitts lymphomas. Both lines were propagated in RPMI 1640 and 10 percent fetal calf serum. IFN was concentrated by precipitation with 65 percent saturated ammonium sulfate. Before the assay, the pellet was dissolved in pH 0.025M bis Tris buffered to pH 7.1 and dialyzed to remove residual ammonium sulfate. Except for alpha interferon antigen, the abovedescribed antigens were diluted in PBS buffer Rubella 1 80, Herpes simplex virus 1 20, Cytomegalovirus 1 50, Toxoplasma 1 10, and Treponema pallidum 1 6 . An aliquot of the diluted antigen 40 microliters for StiQSampler and 200 microliters for microtiter wells was.spotted on the solid phase and incubated overnight at 4 8 C in a moist chamber. The antigen solution was discarded and the solid phase was incubated for one hour in 0.01M Tris buffer containing 1 BSA and then dried at room temperature and stored at 20 0C. Example I This example illustrates the comparison of visual and fluorometric readings of the titration of a high titered Cytomegalovirus serum sample. Polystyrene microtiter wells were used as the solid phase. The antigen coated microtiter wells were incubated with 10 microliters of two fold dilutions of serum in 300 microliters of Tris Tweene 80 1 BSA buffer dilution buffer . After 60 minutes, the serum dilutions were discarded and the wells were washed with Tris Tweene 80 buffer wash buffer . The wells were then incubated with 300 microliters of a suspension of microspheres in the incubation buffer. After 30 minutes, the microsphere suspension was discarded and the wells were washed with the wash buffer. The results were evaluated visually in the light box and fluorometrically by a Perkin Elmer fluorometer.The wells showing visible fluorescence in the light box were deemed positive and the wells showing no fluorescence were deemed negative. Figure 1 illustrates the comparison of the visual and the fluorometric readings of the assay. The two readings gave similar end points at a dilution of 1 256. This correspondence demonstrates that the assay results using microspheres can be read visually using an inexpensive light box with little sacrifice in the sensitivity, since the visual end point closely approximates the fluorometric end point. Example 2 This example illustrates the comparison of visual assay for the detection of IgG antibodies toCytomegalovirus, with various methods currently used for the detection of Cytomegalovirus antibodies. These include complement fixation CF , hemaglutination IHA and Immunofluorescence IFA . A 10 microliter aliquot of serum sample was diluted in 500 microliters of dilution buffer in each test tube. The antigen coated StiQ Samplers were immersed into the diluted serum and placed on FIAXe IDT, San Jose, CA shaker for 30 minutes. After a brief buffer wash, the samplers were transferred to test tubes containing a suspension of IgG labeled microspheres in dilution buffer, and incubated for 30 minutes. After another brief buffer wash, the assay results were evaluated visually in the light box and fluorometrically in the FIAXX fluorometer. The results summarized in Tables I and II below show that the visual assays demonstrate excellent sensitivity and specificity when compared with the reference methods.

Approximately 10 microliters of serumsample was pipetted into each test tube and preheated for 30 minutes, with 120 microliters of IgG antibodies removing reagent H. Schmitz et al., Journal ofClinical Microbiology 1975 1 132 135 and diluted in 320 microliters of dilution buffer. The remaining assay protocol was similar two one described in Example 2 for the detection of IgG antibodies. A total of 11 serum samples were assayed. These samples were well characterized by the Rubazyme M Abbott assay and contained high as well as low levels of IgM antibodies to Rubella virus. The results, summarized in Table VI, show that the assay demonstrates good sensitivity as well as specificity when compared to the Rubazyme assay.

An assay protocol, similar to one outlined inExample 2 was used for the present example. The StiQSamplers was coated with 5 x 10 Treponema pallidum per sampler. A total of 45 serum samples were assayed.These serum samples were previously tested for the presence of anti Treponema pallidum antibodies by theFTA ABS test. The results, summarized below in Table VIII, show that the sensitivity and specificity of the visual assay compares well with the FTA test.

The solid phase was comprised of polystyrene microtiter wells. The microtiter wells were coated with mouse monoclonal antibody 2 micrograms well directed against human leukocyte interferon supplied by Thomae of West Germany using the coating procedure described above. The fluorescent microspheres were coated with a second mouse monocloncal antibody, directed against human interferon supplied by the same source as above . The antibody coated wells were allowed to incubate with various dilutions of alpha interferon.The unreacted interferon was discarded and after washing with wash buffer, the wells were incubated with monoclonal antibody labeled microspheres. The unreacted microspheres were discarded and the wells were finally washed with the wash buffer. Appropriate controls were also included to monitor the non specific binding. The results of the assay were evaluated in the light box. The wells showing visible fluorescence were deemed positive while those showing no fluorescence were deemed negative. The detection limit was 1.5 nanograms when the assay time was 7 hours 6 hours first incubation and 1 hour second incubation and 150 picograms when the assay time was 19 hours 18 hours first incubation and one hour second incubation . The results of the assay are summarized in Table IX below.

Human whole blood samples were obtained fromAmerican Red Cross Blood Bank. The blood was collected in vacutainer tubes containing 15 EDTA. To obtain serum, half of the whole blood sample was permitted to clot, stored in the refrigerator overnight and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The susernatant serum was removed and stored in the refrigerator. The serum and blood samples were assayed using the procedure outlined in Example 2. The volume of blood sample assayed was twice as compared to serum 20 microliters of blood vs. 10 microliters of serum to compensate for the volume of red blood cells in whole blood samples compared to plasma. The results of the assay, summarized below in Table X, show that identical correlation of assay results between serum and whole blood samples was obtained.
