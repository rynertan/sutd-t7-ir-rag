# Method and apparatus for analyzing gems.

## Abstract
The disclosure is directed to an apparatus and method for analyzing gem specimens. In the disclosed embodiment, a small cabinet 12 includes a source discharge lamp 21 for radiating electromagnetic energy over a broad spectrum of wavelengths. A gem specimen G is placed in a small drawer 19 that, upon closure, becomes an optically sealed chamber in communication with the radiation source 21 . Also upon closure, a mechanical shutter mechanism 58 62 permits registration between the radiation source 21 , gem specimen G and a photocell detector 71 that senses radiation emitted from the gem specimen G as a result of its interaction with the spectrum of wavelengths from the radiation source 21 . This interaction comprises the com bined processes of transmission of and absorption by the gem specimen of the source radiation, internal reflection and internal excitation e.g., fluorescence , the latter of which produces a frequency shift to a narrow spectrum of energy to which the photocell detector 71 is specifically designed to sense. The output of the photocell detector 71 is an analog signal that is processed by electronic circuitry in one of two manners. First, the signal is digitized through an analog to digital converter 91 and is displayed as a numerical digital readout 96 . In the second manner, the analog signal is compared with one or more groups of reference values corresponding to different species of gems. If the analog signal falls within a first arbitrary range of values, it is determined to be natural . In a second arbitrary range, it is determined to be synthetic . A third range falls between the first and second ranges, and a value within this range is indicative of a gem of indeterminate origin or an operational malfunction. Another group of reference values is used to determine either of two abnormal conditions viz., a blockage of radiated energy to the detector or the absence of a gem from the specimen holder. The apparatus readout comprises a liquid crystal display that selectively indicates the mode of operation, the natural, synthetic or indeterminate nature of the gem specimen, and a digital readout of a unitless, arbitrary number which may be used to determine gem quality.
