# Friction clutch driven plate.

## Abstract
A friction clutch driven plate comprises an inner hub 11 and a sleeve 13 mounted on the inner hub for limited relative angular movement thereto by means of splines 14,15 having clearance therebetween. Side plates 31,32 secured to the hub are coupled through main torsion damping springs 41 to a friction facing carrier 33 having friction facings 37 and 38 . The relative angular movement between hub 11 and sleeve 13 is controlled by two circumferentially extending springs which are arranged to be loaded in bending during this movement. To this end seats 26 on the hub and 29,29A on the sleeve engage against abutments 24, 25, 28, 28A on the springs. The springs are located in grooves 17 and 18 of the hub and bear against end faces 22 and 23 of the sleeve and so act as circlips to provide axial location between the hub and the sleeve.
