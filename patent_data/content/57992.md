# Dynamic circumference gauge.

## Abstract
A dynamic circumference gauge 70 has a spring 76 which maintains contact with a moving cigarette rod 74 . Strain gauges 50, 52 mounted on opposite faces of the spring indicate changes in the circumference of the moving cigarette rod 74 . Changes in cigarette rod circumference, as indicated by the gauge, may be used to make adjustments to a cigarette forming machine, e.g. to a folder or short tongue, to return the cigarette rod circumference to within acceptable limits. A second dynamic circumference gauge may be located ninety degrees from the first gauge 70 to provide accurate circumference measurements for out of round cigarettes.
