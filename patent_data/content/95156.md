# Process for preparing quaternary ammonium functional silicon compounds, products prepared thereof and use of the same.

## Abstract
Quaternary ammonium functional silicon compounds are prepared by reacting carbinol functional quaternary ammonium compounds with carboxylic acid functional sili con compounds. These quaternary ammonium functional silicon compounds may be used as antistatic finishes for textiles.
