# Radiation sensitive emulsion and direct positive photographic element containing the same.

## Abstract
A radiation sensitive emulsion particularly adapted to forming a direct positive image, comprised of a dispersing medium and silver halide grains, and a direct positive photographic element containing the same are disclosed. The emulsion is characterized by a first, core shell silver halide grain population having a coefficient of variation of less than 20 , and a second silver halide grain population capable of internally trapping photolytically generated electrons and incapable of forming a surface latent image within the direct positive exposure latitude of the first grain population, said second grain population have an average diameter less than 70 that of said first grain population, and said first and second silver halide grain populations being present in a weight ratio range of from 5 1 to 1 5.
