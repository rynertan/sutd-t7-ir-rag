# AMMONIUM SULFATE RECOVERY PROCESS

## Abstract
The heavy organic material contained in the liquid bottoms from the quench column of an acrylonitrile recovery and purification system is extracted therefrom using aceto nitrile as the extractant. The quench tower bottoms are preferably concentrated prior to extraction. After extraction of the heavy organic material from the quench tower bottoms, the purified quench tower bottoms are an ideal source of fertilizer grade ammonium sulfate.
