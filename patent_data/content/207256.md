# Methods and apparatus for separating gases and liquids from natural gas wellhead effluent.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for improving the volumetric yield of wellhead gas and the hydrocarbon composition of the liquid condensate from a natural gas well by the use of multi ple stages of gas liquid separation and gas compression in cluding the use of heating means 10 for heating the wellhead gas stream to a predetermined temperature valve means 11 associated with the heating means 10 for reducing the press ure of the wellhead gas stream in the heating means to a predetermined reduced pressure to produce a reduced press ure and reduced temperature well head gas stream mixing means 5 for mixing the reduced pressure wellhead gas stream with compressed gases and vapors which have been subjected to multiple stages of compression high pressure gas liquid separation means 20 for separating gases from liquids in the heated, reduced pressure wellhead gas stream that have been mixed with compressed gases and vapors second gas liquid separation means 30 operating at a lower pressure than the high pressure gas liquid separation means 20 for further separation of gases and vapors from the liquid separated by the high pressure gas liquid separation means 20 to produce flashed gases, vapors and liquid components and gas compression means for compressing and liquifying the flashed components recovered from the second gas liquid separation means and means 92, 94 for introducing the compressed flashed components into the reduced press ure wellhead gases in the mixing means.
