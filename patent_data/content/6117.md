# Overrunning load control for hydraulic motors.

## Abstract
Overrunning load control including a hydraulic motor 10 having a part adapted to be connected to a reservoir 48 and a hydraulic fluid pump 20 . A normally closed check valve 46 connects the port to the reservoir and includes two, hydraulically opposed, differential surfaces 52, 54 one being smaller than the other and being disposed to be responsive to pressure at the port. Included is a normally closed, pilot operated, first metering valve 80 having an inlet 88 and an outlet 90 and a second metering valve 58 also having an inlet 68 and an outlet 66 along with a shiftable metering element 60 interposed therebetween. A spring 62 biases the element towards a position minimizing flow between the inlet and the outlet and a pressure responsive surface 70 is disposed on the element in bucking relation to the spring. The first valve inlet 88 is connected to the second valve outlet 66 and to a larger surface 54 of the check valve, and the port is connected to the second valve inlet 68 as well as connected to direct pressure to the second valve pressure responsive surface 70 . The first valve outlet 90 is connected to the reservoir 48 . The first valve controls the degree to which the check valve may open while the second valve provides load compensation in the circuit.
