# Connecting device for wires.

## Abstract
A device for connecting two wires in series consists of a block 3 having two bores 8 extending end to end of the block. At first ends 12 of the bores located respectively at opposite ends of the block the wires are anchored when tensioned e.g. by means of split conical wedges , so that the tensioned length of each wire extends through the block to exit at the second end of the bore. To improve access to the wires when tensioning them, the bores have portions 8a and 12 extending from said first ends which have straight axes 20,22 , these axes not being parallel to each other but lying in parallel planes. Adjacent the second ends, the walls of the bores have curved portions to permit the wires to lie on a common axis where they exit from the bores.

## Description
Connecting device for wires 1 The present invention relates to a device for connecting in series two wires which are to be placed under tension, said device comprising a block having two opposite ends, two bores each extending from one end to the other end of the block to receive the respective wires and two anchoring means respectively associated with the bores for anchoring the two tensioned lengths of the wires respectively at the opposite ends of the block with the tensioned length extending through the respective bores, each bore over at least a substantial portion of its length having a straight longitudinal axis. Such devices are particularly applicable in the field of concrete reinforced by prestressed or post stressed wires. In this specification, including the claims, we mean by the word wire to include strand, cable and other multi ply wires used e.g. in concrete reinforcement, as well as single filament wires. The invention is applicable to all such different forms of tendon. U.E. patent specification 1s467,30 describes the construction and operation of a device for connecting two wires, particularly in reinforced concrete work. The device is a block having parallel bores for the respective wires, and anchoring means specifically longitudinally split conical wedges for anchoring the wire at one end of each bore with the tested length extending through the bore. Since the device of the present invention is used in generally the same way as this known device, reference should be made to specification 1,467,309 for a full description of that device and its use. In practice this known device suffers certain disadvantages. Firstly, when the Jack is applied to one end of the device in order to pull one wire through the device thereby tensioning both wires , the other wire is often an obstruction since it exits from the device at the same end. Secondly if the device is joining two wires at a point which is located in a flat array of parallel wires, the wires adjacent the wires being joined may obstruct the operation of the Sack, and it may not be possible to operate the jack from both above and below the array of wires as is necessary if it is desired to apply the jack to both the wires being connected by the device .A further disadvantage of the known device is that the tensioned wires are given a sharp bend where they exit from the bores this creates friction when the wires are being tensioned, leading to a need for excessive force and inexact tensioninl . The object of the present invention bÂµwt6JU provide a connecting device for wires which overcomes the disadvantages Of the known device and is therefore easier to use than this known device in particular the object is to reduce or avoid obstruction of a jack by the wires being connected or by adjacent wires. The invention as claimed is intended to achieve this result. The new arrangement of the bores in the device has the effect that the two bores are tilted with respect to each other, so that i the wires both inside and outside the bores do not lie in a common plane thus minimizing obstruction, and ii the device can be arranged with the connected wires horizontal so that a jack can be applied to both wires from above the device. Preferably, each said bore has a first end at which in use the tensioned wire is anchored and a second end at which the tensioned length of the wire exits from the bore. The said portion of the bore having a straight axis is at said first end. In order to avoid a sharp correr at said second ends of the bores, preferably the bore is so shaped as to permit the wire within the bore to curve away from said straight axis and out of the said respective parallel planes to an extent such that at the respective second ends of the two bores, the two wires can lie substantially axially. Preferably the said straight axis portions of the bores are at least 30 , more preferably at least o of the length of the bores. The preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in greater detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows the device embodying the invention connecting two lengths of wire Fig. 2 is an end view of the device of Fig. 1, with the wires and anchoring wedges omitted for clarity Flg. 3 is a section on the line III III ofFig. 2, the plaice of the section including the straight axis of one of the bores Fig. 4 is a side view, partly sectioned on the line TV TV of Fig. 2 and Fig. 5 is a section on the line V V of Fig. 4. Referring to Figures 1 to 5, the illustrated device 2 is used to connect two tensioned lengths of wire 4 and6. The device 2 primarily consists of a block 3. Two bores 8 and 10 which extend throughout the length of the block 3 from one end 3a thereof to the other end 3b thereof receive the wires 4 and 6 respectively. Teach bore 8,10 has a straight central portion 8a, lOa Figs. 3 and 4 of substantially constant circular cross section and two flared portions, one at each end of the bore. The first flared portions 12 and 14 are frusto conical and house anchoring means 18 and 16 in the form of split frusto conical wedges which hold the wires 4 and 6 secure when tension is applied to the wires, with the tensioned lengths extending through the bores 8,10.The frusto conical portions 12,14 are coaxial on axes 20,22 with the constantsection portions 8a, 1Oa. The combined length of the portion 12 and the portion 8a in each case is more than half the overall length of the bore e, and constitutes a straight portion of the bore. The mouths of the frusto conical portions 12,14 are surrounded by annuli 17,19 perpendicular to the conical axes. These annuli 17,19 form abutment surfaces for the jack which is applied to the block to tension the wires 4,6. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the tensioned lengths 4,6 of wire, where they emerge from the block 3, are coaxial on the line X X . As seen in Fig. 4, the straight axes 20,22 of the bores appear parallel as Fip. 3 shows they are however at an angle to each other. In fact they lie in parallel planes, one of which for the bore 8 is the plane of section in Fig.3 and the other of which is indicated by the broken line 24 in Fig. 2. In order that the tensioned wires 4,6 may lie coaxially on the line X X Figs. 1 and 4 as they emerge from the respective ends of the bores 8,10 remote from the anchoring wedges, lengths of the bores adjacent these ends are flared, non symmetrically with respect to the axes 20,22. This is best seen in Figs.2 and 4. Thus the interior wall of the block 3 bounding the bore 10 at the outside of the device i.e. the side away from the other bore 8 is curved outwardly as indicated at 26 in Fig. 4. Consequently, an exit aperture 30 of the bore 10 at this end has an oval or slot shape. The major axis of this oval seeFig. 2 is not perpendicular to the parallel plane 24 in which the axis 22 of the bore 10 lies, but is tilted.In the assembled state of the device, the tensioned wire 6 lies against this curved wall 26 at the outside of the bore 10 with the result that the axis of the wire is smoothy transformed from the straight axis 22 to te coaxial line X X of the two wires 4,6. This curvature is in a plane perpendicular to the plane 24 th ough, because the bore axis 22 isLot perpendicular to the plane of the paper in Fig. 2, the long axis of the oval aperture 3n is tilted, as mentioned above. The corresponding aperture 28 of the bore E can partly be seen in Fi. 2 . As seen inFig. 4, the angle between the line Z and the axes 20,22 15 in each case 14 .As seen in Fig. 3, the corresponding angle between line X Y. and the axes 20, 22 is 6 . The bore 8 is shared and arranged similarly to the bore 10. The device herein illustrated has several main advantages over that of specification 1,467,309. In the latter, the tensioned lengths of the two wires outside the device and the lengths within the bores of the device all lie in the sane plane. In the present device, there is no such common plane accordingly there is likely to be less interference from the wires with a jack applied to the device to tension a wire.Secondly, as Fig. 3 shows best, both axes 20,22 which are the axes along which a jack is applied can be directed upwardly at an angle to the horizontal this makes it much easier to apply the jack to both ends of the device when the device is located in amid a horizontal row of wires. Thirdly, the smooth curvature of the wires within the bores 8,10 means that problems caused by friction during tensioning can be minimized, since sharp angles against which the wires would rub when being tensioned are avoided.
