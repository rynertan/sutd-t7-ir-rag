# Image processing segmentation apparatus.

## Abstract
A segmentation apparatus utilized in an image process ing system for recognizing a pattern in an image inputted thereto includes a separate circuit 19 for outputting logical values of m by n pixels separated from the inputted image, an encode circuit 20 for storing in advance therein codes to be determined according to the content of an inputted pattern and for outputting a code indicating that which set of pixels is identical to the objective pixel by using as an input pattern the logical value ouputted from the separate circuit 19 , and a select circuit 51 for selecting a label of the objective label, from the label data of neighborhood pix els already determined and the new label data assigned, in accordance with the output from the encode circuit 20 .
