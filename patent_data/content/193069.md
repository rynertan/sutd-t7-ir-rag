# Developing apparatus.

## Abstract
A developing apparatus having an electrostatic latent image holder 13 and a developer carrier 2 for carrying a developer 5 and provided opposite to the electrostatic latent image holder 13 and separated therefrom by a predetermined gap, characterized in that said apparatus comprises a developing bias voltage applying section 3 for repeatedly applying to the gap between the electrostatic latent image holder 13 and the developer carrier 2 an alternating current voltage having a plurality of different frequencies in order to form an electric field in the gap sufficient for selectively causing the developer 5 to fly and attach to the electrostatic latent image holder 13 , and a control section 19 for variably controlling application periods of the alternating current voltage having the plurality of frequencies by the developing bias voltage applying section 3 while maintaining a predetermined relationship therebetween.
