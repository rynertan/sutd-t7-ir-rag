# Method and apparatus for positioning and transferring stator coil leads.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for positioning and transfer ring stator coil leads 74 in a dynamoelectric stator assembling machine. The apparatus includes holding de vices 72 for positioning and retaining the stator coil leads 74 after the coils 44 are wound and before they are inserted into the stator core 42 . The apparatus also in cludes lead pullers 76 for transferring the leads 74 , during insertion of the coils 44 into the stator core 42 , from the inserting equipment 10 to a stator carrying pallet 14 having lead retaining devices 104 therein. The appa ratus further includes lead catchers for capturing the leads 74 from the stator pallet lead retaining devices and for transferring the leads 74 from the stator pallet 14 to a lead finishing apparatus.
