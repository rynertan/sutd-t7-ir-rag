## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING CARBONYL COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to a process for producing carbonyl compounds, and more particularly, to a process for producing aldehydes and or ketones by oxidizing an olefin in the presence of a specific solid catalyst.Background of the Invention The so called Hoechst Wacker process is known for producing aldehydes and ketones by oxidizing an olefin in a liquid phase homogeneous system in the presence of a catalyst containing a palladium compound, copper compound, and halogen. This process, however, is disadvantageous in that it requires a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid and consequently requires an apparatus made of expensive, corrosion resistant materials. In addition, the separation and regeneration of the catalyst are not easy and the process is complex, requiring the step of removing chlorinated by products. In order to solve the above mentioned problems encountered in the Hoechst Wacker process which is characterized by a homogeneous system, several attempts have been made to carry out the reactions in the presence of a solid catalyst. For instance, there is known a method 3apanese PatentPublication No. 5765 197รป for oxidizing an olefin with the aid of a catalyst which is prepared by causing activated carbon to adsorb naturally an acid aqueous solution of palladium halide and or rhodium halide. This process provides carbonyl compounds in considerably high yields, but still encounters problems in homogeneous systems because the catalyst system contains a large quantity of halogen. There are also known a method 3apanese Patent Publication No.11734 1972 which employs a molybdenum oxide tin oxide catalyst and a method Japanese Paten Publication No.19250 1972 which employs a palladium vanadium oxide catalyst. These processes are also disadvantageous in that the reaction temperature is comparatively high, the selectivity for ketones is poor in oxidation of an olefin having more than 4 carbon atoms, and the catalyst is deactivated easily.Thus they have not yet been put to practical use. It is an object of the present invention to provide a new process for producing carbonyl compounds in high yields at low temperatures from an olefin of high carbon number, such as butene, which results in the industrially important solvent, methyl ethyl ketone. The present invention is based on the finding that a novel catalyst prepared by adding certain metals, to be described, such as tellurium, to palladium, is very effective for achieving the object of this invention.Summary of the Invention The gist of the present invention is that an effective process for producing carbonyl compounds comprises bringing an olefin into contact with molecular oxygen and water or water vapor in the presence of a solid catalyst containing palladium metal or a compound thereof and one or more metals selected from the group consisting of tellurium, selenium, antimony, and bismuth or a compound thereof.Detailed Description of the Invention Solid Catalyst The solid catalyst used in this invention is prepared by supporting on a proper carrier, palladium metal or a compound thereof and one or more metals, or compounds thereof, selected from the group consisting of tellurium, selenium, antimony and bismuth. The metal compounds used for preparing the solid catalysts include palladium compounds such as palladium chloride, palladium nitrate, palladium sulfate, palladium oxide, and palladium hydroxide tellurium compounds such as tellurium tetrachloride, tellurium dichloride, tellurium dioxide, tellurium trioxide, and telluric acid selenium compounds such as selenic acid, selenium dioxide, and selenyl chloride antimony compounds such as antimony trichloride, antimony pentachloride, antimony trioxide, and antimony pentoxide and bismuth compounds such as bismuth nitrate, bismuth trichloride, bismuth trioxide, and bismuth oxychloride. The carrier that supports the above mentioned metal or metal compound referred to as catalyst component hereinafter is not specifically limited. One may use, for instance, activated carbon, alumina, silica, silica alumina, zeolite, diatomaceous earth, zirconia, titania, and magnesia.Preferred among them is activated carbon. The catalyst component may be supported on the carrier by the following methods. In one procedure, the catalyst component is dissolved in water, an aqueous solution of mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, or an organic solvent, and the carrier is dipped in the resulting solution, followed by heating and drying. In another procedure, after dipping and adsorption, the solution of the catalyst component is removed by filtration or decantation, and the carrier is dried, or washed, if required, or calcined. The supporting procedure may be accomplished in a single stage by dipping the carrier in a solution containing all the catalyst components, or by dipping the carrier in solutions, each containing one catalyst component, successively. The quantity of the catalyst component to be supported on the carrier should be 0.01 to 10 wit., preferably 0.1 to 3 wit., as palladium metal and 0.01 to 10 wt., preferably 0.1 to 3 wit. , as tellurium, selenium, antimony, and bismuth individually. The ratio of tellurium, selenium, antimony, and bismuth to palladium should be 0.01 to 10 gram atom, particularly 0.05 to 5 qram atom, per 1 gram atom of palladium. The solid catalyst thus prepared should preferably be subjected to a reducing treatment, prior to use, such as by treating with hydrogen gas or a reducing organic compound such as hydrazine, formalin, and methanol, at 1000 to 5000C for 0,5 to 10 hours, to obtain a subs tantially halogen free solid catalyst. Olefin The olefin used in this invention includes olefins having 2 to 20 carbon atoms,both monoolefins having one carbon carbon double bond and diolefins having two double bonds. Preferred olefins are linear monoolefins having 2 to 12 carbon atnm ,cm pies of such olefins include ethylene, propylene, 1 butene, 2 butene, 1 pentene, 2 pentene, 1 hexene, 2 hexene, 3 hexene, l heptene,2 heptene,l octene, and 2 octene. These compounds may be used individually or in combination. For example, 1 butene may be oxidised to methyl ethyl ketone by the process of the invention.The process of this invention per mits the presence of saturated aliphatic, saturated alicyclic, and aromatic hydrocarbons and acetylenic hydrocarbons which are detrimental in the Hoechst Wacker process, Oxidation Reaction of Olefin The process is accomplished by bringing an olefin into contact with molecular oxygen in the presence of water or water vapor with the aid of the above mentioned solid catalyst. The reaction may be carried out batchwise or continuously in the presence of the solid catalyst. The solid catalyst may be present in a fixed bed or fluidized bed or dispersed in the reaction medium. The molecular oxygen used includes oxygen gas and an oxygen containing gas such as air. The process may be carried out in the presence of an inert gas such as nitrogen gas, carbonic acid gas, methane, and ethane. The reaction conditions are not specifically limited but the reaction temperature is desirably 500 two 200 0C, preferably 800 to 1500C the reaction pressureis desirably normal pressure to 50 atmospheres and the molar ratio of olefin molecular oxygen water or water vapor is desirably 1 0.1 20 1 40, preferably 1 0.5 12 5 20. The rate of contact of molecular oxygen and water or water vapor with the solid catalyst should be 50 to 10,000, preferably 200 to 2,000, in terms of CHSV gas hour space velocity in the case where the reaction is carried out in the gas phase flow system. effect of the Invention According to the process of this invention, it is possible to produce aldehydes or ketones in higher yields at low temperatures than when employing a conventional solid catalyst. Because of the absence of a halogen containing catalyst, the process of this invention does not encounter corrosion of apparatus and halogenated by products which are inevitable in the Hoechst Waclcer method. The invention is now described in detail, though only byway of illustraion, with reference to the following examples, in which percent is wt unless otherwise specified. Example 1 Preparation of solid catalyst Activated carbon 20 g previously treated with refluxing 15 nitric acid for 15 hours, was dipped in a solution of 0.68 g of palladium chloride PdCl2 dissolved ln 60 ml of 0.5 N hydrochloric acid, and allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 hours. The treated activated carbon was separated from the solution, washed with water, and then dried in an oven at 1100C for 12 hours. Thus, activated carbon carrying palladium chloride was prepared. This activated carbon was then dipped in a solution of 0.422 g of tellurium tetrachloride TeCl4 dissolved in 80 ml of methanol, and allowed to stand for 12 hours.After removal of the solution by filtration, the treated activated carbon was dried in a nitrogen stream at 150 C for 3 hours, and then subjected to reduction treatment at 200 C for 2 hours and then at 400 C for 1 hour with nitrogen gas saturated with methanol at room temperature. Thus a solid catalyst A was prepared which contains 2.05 of palladium and 0.74 O of tellurium, with the atom ratio of tellurium to palladium being 0.3. This catalyst was found to contain a trace of chlorine. Oxidation of 1 butene A mixed gas of 1 butene, air, and water vapor at a molar ratio of 1 5 12 waS supplied at a rate of 300 cc min. GHSV 1,2coo to a stainless steel reaction tube, 18 mm inside diameter, filled with 15 cc of the solid catalyst A prepared in the above sep. The reaction was carried out continuously at 100 C under normal pressure. Five hours after the start of reaction, the reaction product was analyzed to obtain the space time yield and selectivity for methyl ethyl ketone MEK . The results are shown in Table 1.Comparative Example 1 Preparation of solid catalyst A solid catalyst B carrying 2.0 of palladium was prepared as in Example 1, except that treatment with the tellurium tetrachloride solution was not performed. Oxidation of 1 butene The oxidation reaction of 1 butene was carried out as in Example 1, except that the solid catalyst B obtained in the above step was used. The results are shown in Table 1. As is apparent from Table 1, the palladium activated carbon catalyst solid catalyst B resulted in very poor space time yields and selectivity for MEK, with predominant side reactions other than the Hoechst Wacker reaction, whereas the catalyst of this invention provided good space time yields and selectivity for MEK.

The solution was evaporated to dryness, and the activated carbon was dried in an oven at 110 C for 12 hours.Thus, activated carbon carrying palladium chloride and tellurium dioxide was prepared. The treated activated carbon was dried in a nitrogen stream at 1500C for 3 hours, and then subjected to reduction treatment at 200 C for 2 hours and then at 400 C for 1 hour with nitrogen gas saturated with methanol at room temperature. Thus, a solid catalyst C was prepared which contains 2.0 of palladium and 1.0 รณ of tellurium. This catalyst was found to contain a trace of chlorine.
