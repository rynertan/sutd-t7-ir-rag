## Description
BACKCROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a process for preparing polyarylates having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.5 to greater than 1.0 dl g, which process comprises reacting the diester derivative of a dihydric phenol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid in the presence of from about 10 to about 60 weight percent, based on the weight of the polyarylate produced, of at least one halogenated and or etherated substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compound, at a temperature of from about 260 to about 350 C. Polyarylates are polyesters derived from a dihydric phenol, particularly 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane also identified as Bisphenol A, and an aromatic dicarb oxylic acid, particularly mixtures of terephthalic and isophthalic acids. These polyarylates are high tempera ture, high performance thermoplastic polymers with a good combination of thermal and mechanical properties.They also have good processability which allows them to be molded into a variety of articles. Many processes have been described in the litera ture for the preparation of polyarylates. One such process is the diacctate process. In the diacetate process, a dihydric phenol is converted to its diester derivative which is then reacted with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid to form the polyarylate. However, heretofore, the diacetate process has been carried out by several different methods as illustrated in the following U.S. patents In U.S. Patent 2,595,343 issued May 6, 1952, an aromatic bisphenol is first reacted with acetic anhydride to form bisphenol diacetate which is then condensed with an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid to form a polyarylate by an acid interchange reaction.The condensation reaction is performed in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as para toluenesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid. However, this acid exchange reaction does not yield an acceptable product then an aromatic dicarboxylic acid is substituted for the aliphatic acid, U.S. Patent 3,225,003 issued December 21, 1965, describes the preparation of novel copolyesters by reacting hydroqusnone dxacetate with a mixture of hexa hydroterephthalic acid and hexahydroisophthalic acid in the presence of a catalyst, such as sodium acetate, at a temperature of 2300C. The reaction is exemplified as being carried out in the presence of anhydrous sodium acetate catalyst and eutectic mixtures of biphenyl and diphenyl oxide diphenyl ether at 2300C in three stages for a total reaction time of about 28 hours.Thus, this process requires catalyst, long reaction times and several step. U.S. Patent 3,317,464,issued May 2, 1967, describes the prepafation of linear aromatic polyesters by the polycondensation of diphenols, or their diacetates, with polynuclear aromatic dicarboxylic acids. The examples of this patent describe the preparation of the polyester using catalysts, such as mixtures of p toluene sulphonic acid and antimony trioxide,or butyl orthotitanate, optionally in acetic acid. The reaction is carried out in a molten mixture of reagents and catalysts by heating these together under sub asmospheric pressure.The patent states, but does not exemplify, that the reaction may be carried out in solution, in inert solvents, such as alpha methyl naphthalene, biphenyl or diphenyl oxide. Thus, this process requires catalysts as well as sub atmospheric pressure conditions to form the polyesters. U.S. Patent 3,329,653 issued July 4, 1967 describes the preparation of high molecular weight linear condensation polymers,such as aromatic polyesters, aliphatic polyamides, and polycarbamides. These polymers are formed at or below the melting point of the polymer by carrying out the reaction while the reacting materials are suspended in an inert non solvent medium,with a swelling agent for the condensation polymer which also needs to be present in the reaction medium. Example 7 of this patent describes the preparation of poly 2,2 bis 4.hydroxyphenyl propane isophthalate by heating a mixture of 780.9 g of the diacetate of Bisphenol A, 415.3 g of isophthalic acid, 900 g. of Apco Inkol No. 0, 25 g of sulfolane swelling agent and 2.5 g of sodium methoxide catalyst. The reaction is held in reflux for 40 hours.The patent describes, as particularly effective swelling agents, sulfolane, diphenyl ether, and quinoline. Thus, this process requires the use of large quantities of a non solvent, a catalyst, swelling agents as well as long reaction times. U.S. Patent 3,824,213 issued July 16, 197, describes the preparation of halogenated aromatic polyesters by reacting in solution , an aliphatic carboxylic ester of a halogenated bisphenol, such as tetrachloro btsphenol A with an aromatic acid mixture of terephthalic and isophthalic acids at a temperature of 220 3500C, in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of a cobalt, nickel, or manganese salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid.This patent describes that the csterification reaction may be conducted with said catalysts in a suitable solvent, such as a hydrocarbon, halogenated aliphatic Or aromatic hydrocarbon or the like i.e. a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions employed . Specifically these solvents include diphenyl ether, benzophenone, dichloroethane and dichlorobeneene. This patent exemplifies that several prior art catalysts such as magnesium acetate are unsuitable for forming polyesters of acceptable inherent viscosities and that the particular cobalt, nickel or manganese salts, as described in this patent, are necessary to yield polyesters having an inherent viscosity of at least about 0.2, which is considered an acceptable viscosity in this patent. U.S. Patent 3,948,856 issued April 6, 1976, describes an acid interchange polymerization process for producing an aromatic polyester by reacting substantially stoichiometric amounts of an aromatic diester with a dicarboxylic acid at a temperature of 220 350 C, in a solvent, and in the presence of a catalyst, which is a mixture of a transition metal salt of a strong inorganic acid and a transition metal salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid.The solvent includes diphenyl ether, halogenated diphenyl ether, diphenyl sulfone, benzophenone, polyphenyl ethers, etc. U.S. Patents 3,684,766 issued August 15, 1972, and 3,780,148 issued December 18, 1973, describe a variation of the diacetate process. In the patented processes, a prepolymer is formed from, for example, a diacetate, such as Bisphenol A diacetate, and an aromatic acid, in the presence of a catalyst. The prepolymer so formed is then comminuted into small particles. These particles are then contacted with a crystallizing agent to crystallize the polyester. The crystallized polyester is heated in the presence of an inert gas and under reduced pressure to increase the inherent viscosity of the polyester. However, the processes described in these patents require mNltijsteps including the step of crystallizing the prepolymer. U.S. Patent 4,075,173 issued February 21, 1978, describes the preparation of copolyesters by reacting an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, a diacetate of Bisphenol A, and an acetate of p hydroxybenzoic acid. Various processes for producing polyarylates by the reaction ofBisphenol A and terephthalic and isophthalic acids are reviewed in this patent. The following process for producing polyarylates, identified as route 1 , is described in column 2, of the patent EMI6.1 This process is the diacetate process as described herein, or the Acetate process as defined in the patent. Column 2 of the patent States The route 1 its not desirable because the undesir able coloration and deterioration of polymer are particularly remarkable as disclosed in the above mentioned Literature. Further, column 3 of the patent states On the other hand, the route 1 , Acetate process, is economically advantageous because the materials used are cheap end the operation is simple. For example, diacetate of bisphenol A, a monomer for Acetate process, issthesized by merely reacting acetic anhydride andisphenol A. Consequently, it may be said that if the fatal drawbacks of Acetate process, coioration and deterioration, are solved, Acetate process will become the most superior process. Thus, the skilled workers in the field of polyarylate chemistry realize that the existing processes for producing polyarylates have one or more deficiencies, and that a need exists to develop a viable diacetate process for producing polyarylates. In U.S. Patent 4,075,173,a copolyester was prepared by the diacetate process by a solid state polymerization of low molecular weight polymers without using crystal lizing agents. The patentees state eliat their Acetate process is possible only when specific monomers are combined to form the prepolymer. These monomers are the diacetate of bisphenol A, terephthalic acid and or isophthalic acid and an acetate of p hydroxybenzotc acid.The prepolymer is then converted to the desired high molecular weight polymer by solid state polymerization. Thus, the diacetate processes for producing polyarylates by the procedures of the aforediscussed U.S.Patents, and as stated in U.S. Patent 4,075,173, are generally unsuitable since they are either economically unattractive and or produce a commercially unmarketable product. These prior art processes utilize catalysts, large amounts of solvents and generally long reaction times, high temperatures, as well as a complex series of steps, i.e. those as described in U.S. Patents 3,684,766 and 3,780,148. Therefore, a need cxists for an economical and practical diacetate process for producing high molecular weight polyarylates. In the diacetate process for producing polyarylates, problems exist which must be economically and practically solved in order to have a viable, economically attractive process. One problem when a diester derivative of a dihydric phenol is reacted with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid in the molten state is that sublimation of the diacid occurs. This disrupts the stoichiometry of the reaction and the polyarylate produced is not of acceptable mole ocular weight. To prevent sublimation of the diacid, several techniques have been developed. These include the use of large amounts of solvents together with a variety of catalysts and generally long reaction times in the polymerization process. However, these techniques are quite costly and do not provide an optimum process.Another problem when a diester derivative of a dihydric phenol is reacted with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid in the molten state is that the viscosity of the system increases dra atcally towards the cnd of the reaction and therefore the reaction becomes diffusion controlled the molecules are not close enough to insure rapid reaction rather than kinetically controlled.Also, the polymer product is difficult to handle i.e., removal from the reactor due to this high viscosity. Yet another problem in the production of polyarylates by the diacetate process is that a carboxylic acid is a by product of the reaction of a diester derivative of a dihydric phenol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid. In order to provide an efficient, economical process and a high molecular weight polyarylate, the acid, for example, the acetic acid has to be conveniently and efficiently removed. It has now been discovered that polyarylate having a reduced viscosity of at least about 0.5 to greater than 1.0 dl gm, can be cfficiently and economically produced by process which does not require the use of e catalyst or large amounts of solvent. The present process comprises reacting a diester derivative of a dihydric phenol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid in the pre pence of from about 10 to about 60 weight percent, based on the polyarylate produced, of at least one halogenated and or etherated substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compound, at a temperature of from about 260 to about 3500C. The utilization of from about 10 to about 60 percent of a halogenated and or etherated substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compound in the diacetate process prevents sublimation of the aromatic dicarboxylic acid thus producing polyarylates of acceptable molecular weight.Also, said aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds provide for better removal of the acetic acid by product. Further, an additional benefit in using said aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds, in the amounts indicated, is that the viscosity of the system is decreased. This decrease in viscosity provides a faster reaction time since better mixing of the reactants occurs which allows the reaction to proceed under kinetic control. Additionally, by using the specified aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds, reaction times are relatively short so that a polyarylate is produced generally in less than 10 hours at the reaction temperatures and the polyarylates produced possess lighter color, as compared to those utilizing longer reaction times.Furthermore, the present process can be carried out at atmospheric pressure and therefore avoids the use of the costly equipment which is needed by the prior art processes which carry out the diacetate process sunder vacuum. DESCRIPTION OF THE IWThN The present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of normally so lid amorphous polyarylates having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.5 to greater than 1.0 dl gm, which process comprises reacting a diester derivative of dihydric phenol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid in the presence of from about 10 to about 60 weight percent, based on the weight of the polyarylate produced, of at least one halogenated and or etherated substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compound,at a temperature of from about 260 to about 350 C. The process of this invention does not require the use of a catalyst for the reaction of the diester.deriva tive of a dihydric phenol and aromatic dicarboxylic acid. The present process comprises reacting a at least one diester derivative of a dihydric phenol having the following formula EMI10.1 wherein R is independently selected from an alkyl radical having from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, preferably methyl, cycloalkyl having from 4 to about 7 carbon atoms, y is independently selected from alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, chlorine or bromine, z independently has value of from 0 to 4, inclusive, and R is independently selected from a divalent hydrocarbon radical, particularly aikylene or alkylidene radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, especially C CH3 2, cycloalkylene or cycloalkylidene radicals having up to and including 9 carbon atoms, 0, S, SO, S02, and CO, x is O or 1 and b at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid. The diester derivative of the dihydric phenol is prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with an acid anhydride derived from acids containing from 2 to 8 carbon atoms under conventional esterification conditions.The preferred acid anhydride is acetic anhydride.Generally, the dihydric phenol is reacted with the acid anhydride in the presence of an esterification catalyst, either in the presence or absence of a solvent. The dihydric phenols that may be used in this invention include the following 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, bis 4 hydroxy 2,6 dimethyl 3 methoxyphenyl methane, 1, 1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, 1, 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, 1, 1 bis 4 hydroxy 2 chlorophenyl ethane, 1, 1 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, 1,3 bis 3 methy1 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2, 2 bis 3 phenyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2, 2 bis 3 isopropyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2, 2 bis 2 isopropyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane, 3, 3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane, 1,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1,2 bis phenyl propane, 4,4 dihydroxyphenyl ether, 4,4 dihydroxyphenyl sulfide, 4,4 dihydroxyphenyl sulfone, 4,4 dihydroxyphenyl sulfoxide, 4,4 dihydroxybenzophenone , and hydroquinone. These dihydric phenols may be used individually or in any combination which when reacted with an aronatic dicarboxylic acid produces polyarylate polymers that essentially do not crystallize during the reaction and recovery steps. The preferred dihydric phenol is 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane. The aromatic dicarboxylic acids that may be used in this invention include terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, any of the naphthalene dicarboxylic acids and mixtures thereof, as well as alkyl substituted homologs of these carboxylic acids,wherein the alkyl group contains from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, and acids containing other inert substituents such as halides, alkyl or aryl ethers, and the like. Preferably, mixtures of isophthalic and terephthalic acids are used. The isophthalic acid to terephthalic acid ratio in the mixture is about 20 80 to about 100 0, while the most preferred acid ratio is about 25 75 to about 50 50.Also, from about 0.5 to about 20 percent of aliphatic diacids containing from 2 to about 1D carbon atoms, such as adipic acid, sebacic acid, and the like may be additionally used in the polymerization reaction. The dihydric phenols and aromatic dicarboxylic acids are selected so that the polyarylate produced remains in an essentially amorphous state during the polymerization reaction and recovery step. The reaction of the diester derivative of a dihydric phenol with the aromatic dicarboxylic acid is carried out in the presence of from about 10 to about 60, preferably from about 25 to about 60, and most preferably, from about 30 to about 60 weight percent, based on the weight of tho polyarylate produced, of at least one halogenated and or etherified substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compound. The halogenated and or etherified substituted aromatic compounds are of the formulae EMI13.1 wherein X is independently Cl, Br, F, or OR2, a is an integer of 1 to 5, Rlis independently alkyl of 1 to 16 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of 6 to 18 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to 18 carbon atoms, or aralkyl or alkaryl of 7 to 18 carbon atoms, R2 is independently alkyl of 1 to 16 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl of 6 to 18 carbon atoms, and b is integer of 0, 1, or 2 EMI13.2 wherein X, Rland a are as previously defined, and c is an integer of O to 8 a . The heteroaromatic compounds are of the following formula EMI14.1 wherein A is 0, S, or CH N , X and Rlare as previously defined, d is an integer of 1 to 4 and f is integer of 0 to 4 d . The compounds encompassed by structures I through IV include 1,2,3 trichlorobenzene 1,2 ,4 trichloro benzene, 1,2 or 1,3 or l,4 dichlorobenzene 1,2,3or 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 trimethoxybenzene 1,2 or 1,3 or 1,4 dibromobenzene chlorobenzene bromobenzene l chloro naphthalene 2 chloronaphthalene l bromonaphthalene 2 bromonaphthalene 1,2 or 1,3 or 1,4 dimethoxybenzene 2 bromotoluene 2 chlorotoluene 4 bromotoluene 4chlorotoluene anisole 2 methylanisole 3 methylanisole 4 methylanisole 2 chloroanisole 3 chloroanisole 4 chioroanisole 2 bromoanisole 3 bromoanisole and 4 bromoanisole. Additionally, the halogenated and or etherated substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds may be used with up to 90 weight percent of other compounds such as diphenyl ether, dimethylsulfone, etc. The amount of said compounds could vary during the polymerization reaction. For example, it may be advantageous to increase progressively the amount of these solvents to maintain the reaction medium at constant viscosity. The reaction of the diester derivative of the di hydric phenol with the aromatic dicarboxylic acid is performed with these reactants present in amounts of from about 0.85 1.00 to about 1.10 1 00, preferably from about 0.98 1.02 to about 1.02 0.98, diester derivative aromatic dicarboxylic acid. The process of this invention is carried out at a temperature of from about 260 to about 350it and preferably, from about 275 to about 295 C. The present process is generally conducted in an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen . The process is preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure although higher and lower pressures may te used. Otviously, at pressures higher than atmospheric pressure, higher temperatures will result. The polymerization reaction is conducted for a period of time sufficient to produce a polyarylate having a reduced viscosity of at least about 0.5 to greater than 1.0 dl gm, which time is generally less than about 10 hours. The reaction time is generally in the range of from about 4 hours to about 8 hours, depending on the particular polyarylate being prepared. The polymerization reaction of this invention may be carried out batchwise or continuously and by using any apparatus desired. Moreover, the reactants may be added to the polymerization zone in any way or order desired as long as the polymerization takes place in the presence of from about 10 to about 60 weight percent of at least one halogenated and or etherated sutstituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compound. The diester derivative of the dihydric phenol may be fermed, in sits, by adding the dihydric phenol toge ther with the acid anhydride, an aromatic dicarboxylic acid and a halogenated and or etherated substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compound to the reactor and the reaction carried out in a single reaction zone under combined esterification and polymerization conditions as described above. Additionally, the diester derivative of the dihydric phenol may be first prepared and then an aromatic dicarboxylic acid and the halogenated and or etherated substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compound added directly to the same reaction vessel with the polymerization being carried out under the conditions described above. The polyarylate polymer having a reduced viscosity of at least about 0.5 is recovered in its final form by methods well known to those in the art, such as by direct devolatilization in an extruder under conditions sufficient to remove the halogenated and or etherated substituted or heteroaromatic compound, coagulation, spray drying, and the like. The polyarylates may also be prepared by first forming a polyarylate prepolymer having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.1 to about 0.4 dl gm, by reacting the diester derivative of a dihydric phenol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid in the presence of the halogenated and or etherated substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compound under the conditions described previously, for a reaction time of about 3 hours. The polyarylate prepolymer is then heated at temperatures of from about 300 to about 3500C to obtain a polyarylate having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.5 to greater than 1.0 dl gm. Alternatively, the polyarylate prepolymer may be added directly, after its formation, to a vented extruder wherein the molecular weight is increased to form a polymer having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.5 to greater than about 1.0 dl gm. For example, the molecular weight of polyarylate prepolymer is increased in the extruder at a temperature of from about 320 to about 3500C, under a vacuum of about 0.3 to about 2mm Hg and a residence time of from about 10 to about 30 minutes. The process of this invention produces normally solid polyarylates having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.5 to greater than about 1.0, referably from about 0.6 to about 0.8 dl gm, as measured in chloroform 0.5 g dl chloroform or other suitable solvent at 25 C. In those instances where the polyarylate is not soluble in chloroform,other solvents known in the art such as para chiorophenol, phenolltetrachoroethane 60 40 , etc may be used. Reduced viscosities of the polyarylates measured in there solvents generally have the same range. The polyarylates may be prepared in the presence of materials such as molecular weight regulators, antioxidants, and the like. The polyarylates obtained by the process of this invention may be used together with the well known additives such as plasticizers, pigments, lubricating agents, mold release agents, stabilizers, inorganic fillers, and the like. These polyarylates may also be blended with other polymers. EXAMPLES The following examples serve to give specific illustrations of the practice of this invention but they are not intended in any way to limit the scope of this invention. In these examples, all parts and percentages are on a weight basis unless otherwise specified.

The test tube was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. A polymer was recovered by breaking the test tube. The polymer had a deep yellow color. The reduced viscosity of this polymer was measured in chloroform 0.50 gm dl at 25 C and found to be 0.58 dl gm.

The reduced viscosity of this polymer was measured in chloroform 0.50 gm 100 ml at 25 C and found to be 0.27 dl gm.Preparation of Polymer A polymer was prepared from this prepolymer by the procedure as fully described in Example 1. The polymer which was recovered had a reduced viscosity of 0.61 dl gm as measured in chloroform 0.50 gm dl at 25 C. Example 3 The reactor system consisted of an oil heated 2 gallon Inconel reactor fitted with a nitrogen inlet, mechanical agitator, and fractionating colunn packed with ceramic saddles connected to an overhead take off device consisting of a reflux splitter condenser and a collection device. The reactor was charged 2400 grams of Bisphenol A diacetate, 637 grams of isophthalic acid, 637 grams of terephthalic acid and 1482 grams of o dichlorobenzene. The reactor system was evacuated to 120 nnn Hg pressure and then filled with nitrogen. This reactor was charged with nitrogen to achieve a pressure of 70 psig. The oil heater was turned on to raise the temperatures of the reactor to about 2700C. acetic acid started to distill when the temperature reached about 2700C oil temperature 6550C . The reaction mixture was maintained under these conditions for 9 hours. It was observed that the o dichlorobenzene was codistilling with the acetic acid. Thus, additional o dichlorobenzene was added during the reaction to maintain approximately 70 weight percent solids.The reactor was then de pressurized and the product discharged under nitrogen. After cooling, the material was ground and stored in an oven under vacuum. The product was recovered by flushing off the solvent in a Killion 1 inch single screw 2 vent extruder. The barrel temperature was 325 C, the first vent was at about 500 mm Hg, and the second vent was at about 15 20 mm Hg. The residence time for the polymer was 2 5 minutes. The recovered material had a reduced viscosity of 0.83 dl g as measured in chloroform 0.50 gm lOO ml at 250C. It is obvious from the above statements that the following groups are suitable substituents of any compound used according to the present process methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene, hexylene and heptylene.These alkyl and alkenyl groups may be straight chain and brached groups including corresponding cyclo groups. These alkyl groups may also be only a part of said substituents.
