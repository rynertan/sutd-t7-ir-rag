# Switching arrangements for digital telecommunications exchange systems.

## Abstract
The invention provides switching arrangements for use in digital telecommunications exchange systems for local subscriber access and comprises a selector means PUBS which is arranged to interface between a plurality of time division multiplex highway groups G0 to G3 and a plurality of channel digital traffic paths C0 to C5 . The selector means PUBS is microprocessor controlled MCI to effect a plural ity of different switching connectivity modes enabling both way communication between various combinations of the time division multiplex highway groups and the channel traffic paths when the input and output data rates 1 Mbit sec, 64 Mbit sec or 32 Mbit sec of the particular connectivity mode is either compatible or incompatible.
