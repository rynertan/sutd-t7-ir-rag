# Carburator for internal combustion engines with electronic controlled organs capable of maintaining the idling speed of the engine at a constant level.

## Abstract
A carburetor comprising a main barrel 1 in which there is a throttle 5 which turns integrally with a shaft 6 an idle system 2 opens into the main barrel 1 through three holes 3a,3b,3c a lever 7 splined to the shaft 6 and connected to the accelerator 8 to open the throttle 5 against the action of a spring 9 stop devices 10 operate on the lever 7 to define a first position of the throttle 5 for which the said holes 3a,3b,3c are upstream a second lever 11 is idle mounted on the shaft 6 and, by means of pushers 13 and against the action of a rod 17 positioned by a rotating cam 27 with an electromagnetic organ, rotates the first lever 7 and defines, when the accelerator 8 is released, small opening positions of the throttle 5 differing from the first position a microprocessor gearbox processes the signals expressing the functioning conditions of the engine to operate the electromagnetic organ.
