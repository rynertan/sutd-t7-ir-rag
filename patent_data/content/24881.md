## Description
Process for producing polyethylene by continuous multi stage polymerization process . This invention relates to a process for producing polyethylene by a continuous multi stage polymerization process. The polyethylene can be ethylene homopolymer or also a copolymer of ethylene with a small amount say 10 mol or less of one or more othera olefins eg. propylene, butene l, hexene l1 4 methyl pentene l or dienes eg. butadiene, cyclopentadiene, copolymerizable with ethylene. For the main application fields for polyethylene, extrusion moulding and blow moulding, polyethylene having a high molecular weight low melt index , adequate strength and easy processability have been needed. Low melt index polyethylene usually has superior strength but has however a drawback in that it has inferior fluidity at the time of moulding. As a means for solving this problem, a process of broadening the molecular weight distribution has been employed. Thus, polyethylene of narrow molecular weight distribution is suitable for injection moulding,mhereas a broad molecular weight distribution is desirable for polyethylene employed for extrusion moulding and blow moulding.When polymers of narrow molecular weight distribution are subjected to blow moulding, the extrusion pressure at the point of moulding increases excessively, resulting in the infeasibility of moulding or the occurrence of streaks, pockmarks, melt fracture or the like which notably harms the appearance of the product. In the case of extrusion moulding, excessive elevation of extrusion pressure, increase in the moulding unstability, etc, have a deleterious effect upon the resulting product notably to reduce its commodity value. In order to solve these various problems, if the molecular weight distribution of polymer is broadened, then the productivity at the time of processing will be improved and a product having a superior appearance will be obtained. Various processes for broadening the molecular weight distribution are available, such as the addition of a third component to the polymerization system, the use of two kinds of organoaluminium compound as one catalyst component in admixture, the use of a catalyst having various polymerization active points, etc. However by these processes it is not always easy to produce polymers having a sufficiently broad molecular weight distribution. In such a situation, as a means for broadening the molecular weight distribution to a large extent and yet adjusting it to a desired range, multi stage polymerization processes have been proposed none of these have so far been satisfactory.For example, Japanese patent application laid open No. 47079 1976 discloses a continuous multi stage polymerization process comprising preparing a lower molecular weight polymer in the first stage employing a catalyst consisting of a combination of a supported catalyst component with an organoaluminium compound, once releasing gas in the polymerization system and preparing a higher molecular weight polymer in the second stage. The above method, however, has a drawback in that it relies on a high temperature dissolution polymerization at a polymerization temperature of 120 to 250 C and in particular a large amount of solvent is needed since it is necessary to use solvent in an amount sufficient for dissolving polymer.Further,Japanese patent publication No. 42716 1973 discloses a process of carrying out a first stage polymerization, thereafter releasing gas in the vapour phase by opening the polymerization system and then carrying out a second stage polymerization under newly reestablished polymerization conditions. Such a batch manner is much inferior in polymerization productivity. Further, production processes for multi stage polymerization are known from Japanese patent publication No. 11349 1971,Japanese patent application laid open Nos. 7488 1979 and 32588 1979 which involve preparing a higher molecular weight polymer in the first stage and preparing a higher molecular weight polymer in the second stage. The Japanese patent publication No. 11349 1971 discloses a polymerization in the presence of a catalyst consisting of a combination of a trivalent titanium compound which does not need to be supported on a carrier, with an organoaluminium compound, 2 in an inert solvent under a pressure of 10 kg cm gauge or lower. However, according to this process, the catalyst is restricted to the trivalent titanium compound, and moreover the polymerization 2 pressure disclosed therein as an embodiment is 6 kg cm gauge or lower. Under such low polymerization pressures, the productivity of polymer is very low. Moreover, the process is a discontinuous one and there is no concrete description as to a commercially advantageous continuous process. The Japanese patent application laid open No. 7488 1979 discloses a process of carrying out the first stage polymerization with a supported catalyst and in conditions where the polymerization vessel is filled with liquid, but by this method it is very difficult to adjust the molecular weight of polymer.The Japanese patent application laid open No. 32588 1979 discloses a process of forcibly feeding an inert gas into the polymerization vessel of the first stage in order to elevate the total pressure and preparing a higher molecular weight polymer in the first stage polymerization, while preparing a lower molecular weight polymer in the second stage polymerization, but this process has a drawback that a large amount of inert gas fed into the first stage polymerization vessel flows into the second stage polymerization vessel, as it is, without being removed, to make difficult the preparation of sufficiently low molecular weight polymer. On the other hand, the present inventors have studied a catalyst component wherein a reaction product often referred to hereinafter as solid product I of a trivalent metal halide with a divalent metal containing compound eg. hydroxide, oxide, carbonate, a composite compound containing such a compound s or a hydrate of a divalent metal compound is employed as carrier, and have found that when a catalyst is employed consisting of a combination with an organoaluminium compound of a solid product II prepared from such a solid product I , a polysiloxane and a transition metal compound, then the drawbacks of conventional continuous multistage polymerization can be overcome. The present invention resides in a process for producing polyethylene by continuous multi stage polymerization. The process comprises polymerizing ethylene using a combination of the following polymerization steps a and b , in the presence of a catalyst obtained by a particular reaction. Specifically, the catalyst is obtained by reacting a trivalent metal halide with a divalent metal containing compound which is a divalent metal hydroxide, oxide or carbonate or a composite compound containing such a compound or a hydrate of a divalent metal compound, to obtain a solid product I reacting this solid product I with a polysiloxane and a compound of a transition metal of Group IVa or Va of the Periodic Table, to obtain a solid product II comprising the supported transition metal compound and combining this solid product II with an organoaluminium compound, thereby giving the catalyst. In the polymerization step a , ethylene in an amount of 30 to 80 of the total amount of ethylene fed in the multi stage polymerization is polymerized in a saturated hydrocarbon solvent, in conditions where a gas phase is present in the upper part of the 0 polymerization vessel, at a polymerization temperature of 50 C to less than 120 C, under a polymerization pressure of 5 to 70 2 kg cm gauge , while hydrogen is fed in so that the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen in the gas phase in the upper part of the polymerization vessel is in the range above 1 0. 5 up to 1 6. 0. The polymerization system of this stage is referred to hereinafter as polymerization system L. In the polymerization step b , ethylene in an amount of 20 to 70M0 of the total amount of ethylene fed in the multi stage polymerization is polymerized in a saturated hydrocarbon solvent, in conditions where a gas phase is present in the upper part of the polymerization vessel, at a polymerization temperature of 30 to 100 a under a polymerization pressure of 5 to 70 kg cm gauge , while hydrogen is fed so that the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen in the gas phase in the upper part of the polymerization vessel is in the range of 1 0. 001 to 1 0. 5. The polymerization system of this stage is referred to hereinafter as polymerization system H. Further, if necessary or desired, one or more of the above mentioned a olefins or diolefins copolymerizable with ethylene can be fed to the polymerization system L and or polymerization system H to produce copolymer of ethylene with the cr olefin or diolefin, using a small amount relative to the amount of ethylene fed. In this case, the molar ratio for the total of ethylene and the olefin or diolefin to that of hydrogen may be in the ranges given for ethylene to hydrogen for the stages a and or b . The above mentioned small amount is conveniently 10 by mol or less, based on ethylene. In the production process of the present invention, a lower molecular weight polymer is formed in the polymerization system L and a higher molecular weight polymer is formed in the polymerization system H . The order of the combination of L with H is not critical. Namely, one can use a continuous multi stage polymerization process wherein the polymerization step a is carried out first and the polymerization step b is then carried out this process will be hereinafter referred to as continuous multi stage polymerization LH , or the one wherein the polymerization step b is carried out first and the polymerization step a is then carried out this process will be hereinafter referred to as continuous multi stage polymerization HL .The order of these processes may be adequately decided depending on necessity in this invention and when either step is carried out first, polymers having almost the same quality can be obtained. In the continuous multi stage polymerization LH , polymerization is initiated by feeding catalyst to the first stage polymerization system L , and carried out in a saturated hydrocarbon solvent, in conditions where a gas phase is present in the upper part of polymerization vessel, at a polymerization temperature of 50 0C or higher and lower then 12OOC, preferably 700 to 100 C, and under a polymerization pressure of 5 to 70 kg cmê gauge , preferably 10 to 50 kg cmê gauge . The molecular weight of polymer formed is adjusted by feeding ethylene and hydrogen so that the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen in the upper part of polymerization vessel falls in the range of above 1 0. 5 up to 1 6. 0.The molecular weight of the resulting polymer is typically in the range of 2 x 104 to 2 x 105 in terms of weight average molecular weight Mw . The amount of polymer formed is adjusted by feeding ethylene in an amount of 30 to 807to of the total amount of ethylene fed. After completion of the first stage polymerization with the polymerization system L , polymer suspended in the solvent is 2 preferably led to a lower pressure zone at 0. 1 to 30 kg cm gauge where having left the polymerization system L hydrogen dissolved in the solvent is partly withdrawn to the outside of the system. At least a portion of removed hydrogen can be returned to the polymerization system L and reused therein. The abovementioned lower pressure zone is usually provided midway between the respective stages, but it is possible to incorporate the zone into either one of the two polymerization systems. The pressure drop between the polymerization system L and the lower pressure zone is determined by the amount of hydrogen required in the subsequent polymerization system H . The resulting polymer suspended in the solvent from which almost all of hydrogen has been removed is led to the second stage polymerization system H using a transfer means such as a transfer pump. Polymerization is carried out in conditions where a gas phase is present in the upper part of the polymerization vessel, at a newly established polymerization temperature of 30 to 100 C, preferably 40 to 90 C, under a 2 polymerization pressure of 5 to 70 kg cm gauge , preferably 10 to 50 kg cmê gauge . The molecular weight of the resulting polymer is adjusted by feeding ethylene and hydrogen so that the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen falls in the range of 1 0. 001 to 1 0. 5. The molecular weight of the resulting polymer is typically in the range of 2 x 10 to 8 x 10 in terms of weight average molecular weight. The amount of polymer formed is adjusted by feeding ethylene in an amount of 20 to 70 of the total amount of ethylene fed. The molecular weight of the polymer obtained in the second stage is usually controlled only by hydrogen dissolved in solvent, but it is also possible to use feed of fresh hydrogen. The other continuous multi stage polymerization HL is initiated by feeding catalyst to the first stage polymerization system H . This polymerization is carried out in a saturated hydrocarbon solvent, in conditions where a gas phase is present in the upper part of polymerization vessel, at a polymerization temperature of 30 to 100 C, preferably 40 to 90 C and under a polymerization pressure of 5 to 70 kg cmê gauge , preferably 2 2 8 to 70 kg cm gauge , more preferably 11 to 50 kg cm gauge . The molecular weight of the resulting polymer is adjusted by feeding ethylene and hydrogen so that the molecular ratio of ethylene to hydrogen in the upper part of polymerization vessel falls in the range of 1 0. 001 to 1 0. 5. The molecular weight of the polymer is in the range of 2 x 10 to 8 x 10 in terms of weight average molecular weight. The amount of polymer formed is adjusted by feeding ethylene in an amount of 20 to 70 of the total amount of ethylene fed. Successively, the polymer obtained in the first stage polymerization system H is transferred as it is suspended in the solvent to the second stage polymerization system L . At that time, if necessary, it may be transferred after separation of other components such as hydrogen. The transfer is carried out by means of a forced transfer means, such as a transfer pump.The second stage polymerization system L is employed for polymerization in conditions where a gas phase is present in the upper part of the polymerization vessel at a newly established polymerization temperature of 500 to 1200C, preferably 700 to 1000C 2 and a polymerization pressure of 5 to 70 kg cm gauge , preferably 8 to 70 kg cmê gauge , more preferably 11 to 50 kg cmê. The molecular weight of polymer formed is adjusted by feeding ethylene and hydrogen so that the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen falls in the range of above 1 0. 5 up to 1 6. 0. The molecular weight of the resulting polymer is in the range of 2 x 10 to 2 x 10u in terms of weight average molecular weight.The amount of polymer formed is adjusted by feeding ethylene in an amount of 30 to 80 of the total amount of ethylene fed. The catalyst feed is usually carried out only to the first stage polymerization system, but it is also possible to carry out the feed to the second stage polymerization system, if necessary. In the present invention, the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen in the gas phase part in the polymerization systems L and H , and the amount of ethylene fed is determined depending on the application field for the polymer product. For example, where polethylene for film is desired, the conditions of the polymerization system L are as follows the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen is preferably 1 1. 0 to 1 5. 0, more preferably 1 1. 5 to 1 4. 0, and the amount of ethylene fed is 40 to 60geo, preferably 50S0 of the total amount of ethylene fed. On the other hand, the conditions of the polymerization system H are as follows the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen is preferably 1 0. 001 to 1 0. 3, more preferably 1 0. 005 to 1 0. 2, and the amount of ethylene fed is 40 to 605u, preferably 500to of the total amount of ethylene fed. Further, in the case of blow moulding, the conditions of the polymerization system L are as follows the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen is preferably 1 1. 0 to 1 3. 5, more preferably 1 1. 2 to 1 3. 0, and the amount of ethylene fed is 30 to 70 , preferably 50 of the total amount of ethylene fed. Those of the polymerization system H are as follows the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen is preferably 1 0. 005 to 1 0. 5, more preferably 1 0. 01 to 1 0 4, and the amount of ethylene fed is 30 to 70 , preferably 50M0 of the total amount of ethylene fed. In the continuous multi stage polymerization of the present invention, a plurality of polymerization vessels are usually connected in series, but it is also possible to connect a plurality of polymerization vessels in parallel or partly in parallel thereby to arrange the first stage polymerization system and or the second stage one.

The reaction time is suitably 30 minutes to 50 hours at lower reaction temperatures reaction is carried out for a longer time, so that no unreacted trivalent metal remains As for the polysiloxane, chain or cyclic siloxane polymers expressed by the following general formula can be employed EMI11.1 R1 and R2 wherein n is 3 to 10, 000, and R and R represent the same or different groups capable of linking to silicon. Particularly usable are those polysiloxanes wherein the groups RÚ or Rê are throughout the molecule hydrogen or one kind of hydrocarbon groups such as alkyl groups or aryl groups, halogens, alkoxy groups, aryloxy groups, residual groups from fatty acids, etc, and those wherein two or more kinds of the foregoing groups are distributed within one molecule in various proportions, etc.Polysiloxanes which are usually employed are polymers wherein RÚ and Rê are both hydrocarbon groups.

In the preparation of the solid product II , the following concrete procedures may be employed 1 Solid product I , polysiloxane and transition metal compound are at the same time mixed and reacted together 2 Solid product I is mixed with a polysiloxane, and transition metal compound is then added, followed by reaction 3 Solid product I is mixed with transition metal compound, and polysiloxane is then added, followed by reaction 4 Polysiloxane is mixed with transition metal compound, and the resulting mixture is then mixed with solid product I . Any of these preparations may be carried out in the presence or absence of solvent. The mixing proportion of solid product I , polysiloxane and transition metal compound is usually 10 to 10, 000 g, preferably 20 to 5, 000 g of polysiloxane and 1 to 1, 000 g, preferably 10 to 500 g of transition metal compound, based on 100 g of solid product I , respectively, and 2 to 2, 000 g, preferably 5 to 500 g of transition metal compound based on 100 g of polysiloxane.Mixing is normally carried out suitably at 50 to 30 C, most usually at room temperature about 20 0C , and is preferably carried out with stirring. Mixing is followed by reaction eg.with stirring at 30 to 300 C, preferably 50 to 200 C, for 10 minutes to 30 hours. In the case 4 where polysiloxane is mixed with transition metal compound and the resulting mixture is then mixed and reacted with solid product I , the mixture of polysiloxane with transition metal compound may be kept for instance at room temperature to 1000C, preferably at 60 0C or lower, for one minute to 5 hours, in advance of mixing the mixture with solid product I . After completion of the reaction by whatever procedure, the reaction mixture is subjected to separation by filtration and repeated washings to remove unreacted transition metal compound and polysiloxane, followed by drying to obtain solid product II . It is not always necessary to employ solvent at the time of mixing and reaction in the preparation of solid product II , but since uniform reaction is desirable, optionally one or two or all of the above mentioned components may be dissolved or dispersed in solvent in advance, followed by mixing. As for the total amount of solvent employed, about 10 times or less the total amount by weight of the respective components may be sufficient.The solvent employed for preparing the solid product II can be for example an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, cumene, a halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichloroethane, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, carbon tetrabromide, etc, As for the organoaluminium compound, examples include trialkylaluminium s such as triethylaluminium, triis obutylalum inium, trihexylaluminium, dialkylaluminium monochlorides such as diethylalum inium m onochloride, ethylaluminium sesquichloride, ethylaluminium dichloride, etc. Further, alkoxyalkylalum iniums such as m onoethoxydiethylalum inium, diethoxym onoethylalum inium may also be employed. Specific features of the present invention are as follows In the continuous multi stage polymerization of ethylene, use of specific polymerization catalysts shown herein has made possible a low temperature polymerization at 1200C or lower slurry polymerization . Thus the process of the present invention is superior to known continuous high temperature dissolution polymerization, from an economical point of view, in that the amount of solvent used at the time of polymerization is small thereby increasing polymer concentration. Also there is an advantage that polymer can be obtained in the form of powder.Further, in the polymerization of the present invention polymerization reaction and molecular weight are easily controlled, and adhesion of polymer onto the wall of polymerization vessel does not occur at all or is extremely slight thus making possible a long term stabilized multi stage polymerization. The catalysts employed in the present invention are different from known catalysts, that is, they have an extremely high polymerization activity hence it is possible to omit the step of removing catalyst remaining in polymer after completion of the reaction, ie. to omit the deashing step. Another specific feature of the present invention is that the molecular weight distribution of polyethylene obtained is typically much broader than those in the case of known continuous high temperature dissolution polymerizations.Thus, flow characteristics at the time of molding are superior hence resin pressure at the time of molding is low high speed molding is possible and appearance of molded products are good due to no occurrence of melt fracture. In the case of film production, the film has adequate strengths and opacity no fish eye is observed the surface of film is smooth and moldability is stabilized over a long time.Further, the bulk density of polyethylene powder obtained according to the present invention is in the range of 0.35 to 0.45, and due to good form of powder particles, the production efficiency per unit volume of polymerization vessel per hour is high, no trouble at the time of transporting polymer powder through piping occurs and granulation of powder is easy. The present invention will be concretely described by way of Examples and Comparative examples. In these Examples and Comparative examples, melt index was obtained according to ASTM D 1238 E .

Example 10 A continuous multi stage polymerization HL was carried out in the same manner is in Example 9 except that solid product II 5 at a rate of 30 mg hr, ethylene at a rate of 210 N hr and hydrogen in a molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen of 1 0.1 in the gas phase part of the first stage polymerization vessel were fed to the vessel, and ethylene at a rate of 495 NQ hr, and hydrogen in a molar ratio of 1 1.3 in the gas phase part of the polymerization vessel, were fed to the second stage polymerization vessel. The continuous operation was carried out for 150 hours to obtain 130 kg of polyethylene powder. This polyethylene had a melt index of 0.30, a bulk density of 0.38, a density of 0.955 and a Mw Mn value of 22. Bottle was molded from the polyethylene according to blow molding. The resin pressure at the time of molding was low to make possible a high speed molding. The surface of the molded product was good, and the weight and unevenness of the product were satisfactory. Comparative example 17 A one stage polymerization was continuously carried out for 150 hours in the same manner as in Example 10, except that the molar ratio of ethylene to hydrogen in the gas phase part of the polymerization vessel was adjusted to 1 0.8. 40 Kg of polyethylene having a melt index of 0.30 which was the same as in Example 10 were obtained. However, this polyethylene had a Mw Mn value of 6. Bottle preparation according to blow molding was impossible. Comparative example l8 A transition metal catalyst component was obtained in the same manner as in Example 5, 1 except that no methylethylpolysiloxane was employed. The content of Ti atom in 1 g of the catalyst component was 0.16 inmol. A continuous multi stage polymerization of ethylene was carried out in the same manner as in Example 10 except that the above catalyst component was employed in place of solid product II 5, to obtain 25 kg of polyethylene which had a N rn value of 10. w n Bottle was molded from the polyethylene according to blow molding. The surface of the molded product was not smooth due to melt fracture, and the thickness was uneven. Thus the bottle was unsatisfactory. Example 11 1 Preparation of transition metal catalyst component Hydromagnesite 3MgCO3.Mg OH 23H2O 65 g and ferric chloride anhydrous 70 g were mixed and milled in a vibration mill for 10 hours, and then reacted at 3000C for 1 hour to obtain a solid product I . This solid product I 100 g and chain di n butylpolysiloxane viscosity 1000 centistokes 200 g were added to o dichlorobenzene 150 mQ and mixed together, and further TiC 4 200 g was added, followed by reaction at 1600C for 3 hours to obtain a solid product II referred to hereinafter as solid product 11 11 . The content of Ti atom in 1 g of solid product II 11 was 0.20 mmol. 2 Continuous mult stage polymerization of ethylene HL A first stage polymerization was carried out employing polymerization system H in the same manner as in Example 8 except that solid product II 11 at a rate of 35 mg hr, triethylaluminum in place of triisobutylaluminum, at a rate of 0.35 mmol hr, hexane at a rate of 2 her, ethylene containing 3 by volume of butene l at a rate of 310 N hr and hydrogen in a molar ratio of ethylene containing butene to hydrogen of 1 0.05 in the gas phase part of the first stage polymerization vessel were fed to the vessel, and the total pressure was adjusted to 20 kg cm2 gauge . Successively, a second stage polymerization was carried out employing polymerization system L in the same manner as in Example 8 except that ethylene at a rate of 300 N hr and hydrogen in a molar ratio of ethylene containing butene introduced at the first stage polymerization vessel to hydrogen of 1 3.0 in the gas phase part of a second stage polymerization vessel were fed to the vessel at 850C without adding fresh triethylaluminum and the total pressure was adjusted to 35 kg cmê gauge . The above mentioned multi stage polymerization was continuously carried out for 150 hours. Operation was extremely stabilized. Without deashing and after drying, 111 kg of polyethylene powder were obtained. The polymer yield was 21,100 g polymer g II .Hr and 106,000 g polymer mmol Ti Hr. This polyethylene had a melt index of 0.30, a bulk density of 0.38, a density of 0.956 and a Mw Mn value of 6. Bottle was prepared according to blow molding.Drawdown of parison was low no melt fracture at the time of molding occurred no sharkskin phenomenon was observed and the surface of molded product was very good the weight of one molded product was 275 g, that is, sufficient there was almost no uneven thickness and the resistance to stress cracking F50 value was 170 hours, that is, no problem was raised. Thus the bottle was prdctically useful. Comparative example 19 A continuous multi stage polymerization of ethylene was carried out in the same manner as in Example 11 except that ethylene containing 10 by volume of butene l was fed at a of 70 N hr and hydrogen was fed so that the molecular ratio of ethylene containing butene to hydrogen in the gas phase part was adjusted to 1 0.002 to carry out a first stage polymerization under a total pressure of 10 kg cm2 gauge , and then ethylene was fed at a rate of 540 N hr and hydrogen was fed so that the molecular rati of ethylene containing butene to hydrogen in the gas phase part was adjusted to 1 1.7 to carry out a second stage polymerizationunder a total pressure of 40 kg cmê gauge . 109 Kg of polyethylene were obtained. This polyethylene had a melt index of 0.35 and a M M value of 12. w n Bottle was prepared according to blow molding.Drawdown of parison was high melt fracture occurred at the time of molding the surface of molded product was bad the weight of one molded product was 210 g, that is, insufficient and there was observed an uneven thickness phenomenon to such an extent that the thickness of the molded product was partly very small. Thus the bottle was not practically useful. Example 12 A continuous multi stage polymerization HL of ethylene was carried out in the same manner as in Example 11 except that solid product II 5 obtained in Example 5, at a rate of 30 mg hr, ethylene at a rate of 200 NQ hr, and hydrogen in a molecular ratio of ethylene to hydrogen of 1 0.07 in the gas phase part of a first stage polymerization vessel were fed to the vessel to carry out a first stage polymerization under a total pressure of 15 kg cm2 gauge at 650C, and then ethylene was fed at a rate of 200 NQ hr and hydrogen was fed so that the molecular ratio of ethylene to hydrogen in the gas phase part was adjusted to 1 2.5 to carry out a second stage polymerization under 2 a total pressure of 25 kg cm gauge at 90 C. 72 Kg of polyethylene were obtained. This polyethylene had a melt index of 0.25, a bulk density of 0.40, a density of 0.954 and a Mw Mn value of 24. Bottle was prepared according to blow molding.The appearance did not raise any problem almost no uneven thickness was observed and the weight of one molded product was 260 g. Thus the bottle had practically sufficient performances.
