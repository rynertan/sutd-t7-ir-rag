# HEAT DRIVEN HEAT PUMP SYSTEM AND METHOD OF OPERATION

## Abstract
Heat driven heat pump system comprising a cold chamber 22 , a hot chamber 20 , and an intermediate working chamber 18 , regenerator means 30 intercoupling the hot and cold chambers, means coupled to all said chambers 14, 16, 18 for varying the volumes thereof in cyclic fashion to induce pressure and temperature changes in the working fluid in all three chambers, heat exchanger means 24 coupled between the hot chamber 20 and the regenerator means 30 for adding thermal energy to the working fluid, heat exchanger means 36 coupled between the intermediate chamber 18 and an intermediate region 32 of the regenerator means for extracting thermal energy, and heat exchanger means 40 coupled between the cold chamber 22 and the regenerator means 30 for adding thermal energy. According to the invention the pressure ratio between maximum and minimum pressures in the working fluid is between 1.1 and 1.5 and the ratio of the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold chambers is in excess of 1.5, such that an ambient source contributes heat to the working fluid through said heat exchanger means 40 at the cold chamber and the coefficient of performance between the thermal input at said hot chamber 20 and the output at said intermediate working chamber 18 is in excess of 1.4.
