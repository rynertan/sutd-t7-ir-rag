After solvents evaporated in vacuo the residue is chromatographed on TLC plate silica gelGF, 500 p eluting with 50 ethylacetate cyclohexane to give 12 mg of 7,IR CKCl3 1770 cm 1, and 1740 cm 1 NMR 300 MHZ, CDCl3 1.15 d , 2.80 3.30 m 3.53 q , 4.35 q , 5.21 quintet , 4.55 d , 4.82 d , 4.55 d , 4.62 d , 6.51 d 7.49 q , , 7.55 7.83 d and 8.12 m ppm. Preparation of I EMI115.1 Trans 6 l R o nitrobenzyloxycarbonyloxyethyl l methyl l carbadethiapen 2 em 3 carboxylic acid onitrobenzyl ester 4 mg in 4 ml H20 and 4 ml dioxane is photolysized in a quartz tube under 3500A in the presence of NaHC03 5 mg at 20 C for 2.5 hr. The mixture is extracted with ether. The aqueous layer is neutralized with HC1 then concentrated to 1 ml. Chromatographic purification of the crude product by a XAD 2 resin 1.5 x 5 cm eluting with water gives I 0.13 mg as sodium salt. Electrophoresis shows single bioactive zone which moves 7.9 cm toward anode at 2KV, for 20 min in 0.05M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer.

The following examples are illustrative of the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations TABLET PER TABLET 1 methyl 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 2 aminoethylthio 1 carbadethiapen2 em 3 carboxylic acid 125 mg. Dicalcium Phosphate 192 mg.Cornstarch, U.S P. 6 mg.Lactose, U.S.P. 190 mg.Magnesium Stearate Balance The active ingredient is blended with the dicalcium phosphte, lactose and about half of the cornstarch. The mixture is then granulated with 15 cornstarch paste 6 mg and rough screened. It is dried at 45 C and screened again through No. 16 screens.The balance of the cornstarch and the magnesium stearate is added and the mixture is compressed into tablets, approximately 0.5 inch in diameter each weighing 800 mg.
