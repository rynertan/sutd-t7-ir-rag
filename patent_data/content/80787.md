# Method for making thixotropic materials.

## Abstract
A process for producing a liquid solid composition comprising heating a liquefiable material sufficiently to form a liquid phase with solid dendritic particles therein without completely liquefying the material and subjecting said liquid solid material to a shearing action sufficient to break at least a portion of the dendritic structures. The process includes injection molding, forging or die casting the mate rial produced by the process.
