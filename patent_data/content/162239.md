## Description
ERCUTANEOUS ABSORPTION ACCELERATOR AND PREPARATION CONTAINING SAME The present invention relates to a percutaneous absorption acceXerator and a percutaneous absorbent preparation containing the same and, more particularly to a percutaneous absorption accelerator containing ether derivatives of specific glycerols or polyglycerols and alcohols as effective components and, percutaneous absorbent preparation containing the percutaneous absorption accelerators and pharmaceutically effective components.Prior Art As methods for administration of drugs, oral administration, rectal administration, intracutaneous administration, etc. have been hitherto generally adopted.Among them, oral administration has been widely employed.However, in the case of oral administration, the oral administration encountered defects that side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbance, anorexia, vomitting, abdominal pain, etc. have been caused sometimes and, at the same time, it is necessary, in most cases, to administer large quantities of drugs, and the like. In recent years, preparations through percutaneous administration have been developed for purposes of eliminating such defects, expecting that the side effects would be minimized and pharmacological effects would be exhibited more safely and, some products have been commercially available. In many cases, however, percutaneous absorbability of pharmaceutically effective components in such preparations are unsatisfactory yet but the purposes are satisfactorily achieved only with difficulty.Namely, skin, inter alia, its keratin layer which constitutes the outermost layer, functions physiologically and acts as a protective wall against permeation of substances into the body and, in many cases, it is difficult for a base alone used for conventional topical agents to attain percutaneous absorption sufficient for pharmaceutically effective components formulated therein.For this reason, any device is necessary to control the permeability of drugs through keratin layer and enhance percutaneous absorption of drugs.Prior Art In addition, for accelerating absorption of harmacologically active substances from the mucosal portions of the human body mucous membrane of the eye, nasal mucous membrane, bucal mucos membrane, vaginal mucous membrane, rectal mucous membrane, etc. , improvement of preparation form, improvement of bases, formulation of compounds having absorption acceleration effect, and the like have been made. Among them, the improvement of preparation form and the improvement of bases are possible to a certain extent however, epoch making improvement is not expectable and, the target of the research has.been focused upon search and application of compounds having absorption accelerating effect. For such purposes, it has been generaly done to formulate a so called percutaneous absorption accelerator in a base. As such absorption accelerators, there are known dimethyl sulfoxide amide compounds such as dimethyl acetamide, dimethylformamide, N,N diethyl m toluamide, etc. azacycloalkan 2 ne derivatives such as l dodecylazacyclo heptan 2 one, etc. esters of alcohols and carboxylic acids such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, diethyl sebacate, diisopropyl adipate, etc., crotonyl N etyl o toluidine, etc. However, these absorption accelerators are yet unsatisfactory with their absorption accelerating effect and, in many cases, practically pharmacological effects cannot be obtained.In addition, these absorption accelerators involve such problems in practical use under actual circumstances that the absorption accelerators themselves show irritation to the skin and corrode synthetic resins due to the property as potent solvents to dissolve irritative substances, sensitized substances, etc. out of containers for drugs, clothes, accessories, etc. so that general adoptation and use are restricted.Means for solving the Problem Therefore, the present inventors extensively investigated in view of such actual circumstances and as a result, have found that by formulating specific ether derivatives of glycerols or polyglycerols as percutaneous absorption accelerators in a base, percutaneous absorption of pharmaceutically effective components can be markedly increased and pharmacological effects of the pharmaceutically effective components can be exhibited effectively and safely and thus have accomplished the present invention.

The results are shown in Table 6.Preparation Preparation 10 of the present invention To 10 parts weight basis, hereafter the same of gelatin were added 35 parts of water. The mixture was warmed to 700C to dissolve gelatin therein. To the solution were added 12 parts of titanium oxide, 10 parts of glycerol, 10 parts of sorbitol and. 10 parts of l 0 n dodecyl 3 0 methyl 2 02 ,3 dihydroxypropylglycerol. Then, 5 parts of self cross linkable sodium polyacrylate prepared in accordance withExample 1 of Published Examined Japanese Patent Application 30710 79 and 5 parts of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose were added to the mixture. Further 3 parts of a drug drug mixture obtained by formulating l menthol, d camphor and methyl salicylate in a weight ratio of 5 1 4 were added thereto and, the mixture was kneaded to obtain a cataplasm paste composition.The composition was coated on a lint sheet. A polypropylene film was applied to the paste surface, which was cut into an appropriate size to obtain a cataplasm.Preparation 11 of the present invention A cataplasm similar to Preparation 10 of the present invention was prepared by formulating 10 parts of l 0 methylbranched isos tearyl 3 0 methyl 2 0 2 ,3 dihydroxypropylg ly cerol instead of l 0 n dodecyl 3 0 methyl 2 0 2 , 3 dihydroxy propylglycerol in Preparation 10 of the present invention, 10 parts of glycerol and 10 parts of sorbitol. Comparative preparation 5 A cataplasm similar to Preparation 10 of the present invention was obtained except that 15 parts of glycerol and 15 parts of sorbitol were used in place of 10 parts of glycerol and 10 parts of 1 0 n dodecyl 3 0 methyl 2 0 2 ,3 di hydroxypropylglycerol.Method Test for percutaneous absorption of methyl salicylate Seven 7 Japanese white female rabbits weighing about 3 kg were used as one group. Each sheet of the cataplasms of the present invention and the comparative preparation, in which 1.2 wt of methyl salicylate was formulated, were applied to the normal abdominal skin 10 cm x 14 cm of the rabbits in each group, from which the body hair was cut, respectively. Blood was collected from the vein of the femur after 3, 6, 10, 20 and 30 hours and, blood concentration of methyl salicylate was measured.

In particular, the cataplasm of the present invention obtained by formulating l O n dodecyl 3 O methyl 2 0 2 ,31 dihydroxypropylglycerol as the percutaneous absorption accelerator showed extremely high percutaneous absorption of methyl salicylate.Example 5 Topical agents containing naphthiomate shown below were prepared and, the percutaneous absorption was tested. The results are shown in Table 7. Preparation Preparation 12 of the present invention A mixture of 1 g of naphthiomate, 5 g of l 0 n dodecyl 3 0 methyl 2 0 2 , 3 dihydroxypropylglycerol, 14 g of glycerol triacetate, 30 g of methyl ethyl ketone and 50 g of ethanol was made a liquid topical agent.Comparative preparation 6 A mixture of 1 g of naphthiomate, 19 g of glycerol triacetate, 30 g of methyl ethyl ketone and 50 g of ethanol was made a liquid topical agent.Method Test for percutaneous absorption of naphthiomate Wistar strain male 10 rats, weighing about 150 g, were used as 1 group. The topical agent was applied to the normal back skin 5 cm x 4 cm of the rats of each group, from which the body hair was cut, in a dose corresponding to 2 mg of naphthiomate. Blood was collected from the abdominal main artery after 10 hours and, blood concentration of naphthiomate was measured.
