## Description
POLYETHYLENE ETHER RESIN COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING OLEFIN POLYMER OR COPOLYMER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The polyphenylene ethers are high performance engineering thermoplastics which possess high melt viscosities and softening points and this makes them useful for many applications where resistance to high temperatures is desired. These materials are described in many publications, including U.S. Patents 3,306,874 3,306, 875 3,257,357 and 3,257, 358. Certain properties of the polyphenylene ethers are undesirable for some uses, however. For example, parts molded or otherwise shaped from polyphenylene ether resins are somewhat brittle due to poor impact strength and, thus, they are more easily fractured or shattered. Also, the relatively high melt viscosities and softening points of the polymer sometimes cause difficulties in processing. Because of the high temperatures required to melt the resin and achieve good flow, special equipment is often necessary.Unfortunately, the resin is more likely to undergo degradation and discoloration at such elevated temperatures. It is now well known that properties of the poly phenylene ether resins can be altered materially by blending with other resins. For instance, U.S. Patent 3,383,435 discloses compositions of polyphenylene ether resin and polystyrene which are characterized by improved properties both during and after molding. It is also known that when polyethylene, an olefin resin, is incorporated in small amounts such as 5 parts by weight or less with polyphenylene ether resin or composition of the resin, the melt flow is improved. Polyphenylene ether resin and polyethylene are not usually compatible, however. If attempts are made to include larger amounts of the polyethylene in the resin, the resultant mixture is less homogeneous. Phase separation occurs during molding of such resins so that molded articles may be brittle and tend to undergo delamination. It has been recently found that relatively larger amounts of polyethylene as well as other olefin polymers and copolymers can be successfully incorporated into a polyphenylene ether resin composition if certain elastomeric triblock copolymers are present. Compositions of this kind, which are characterized by good melt flow properties, are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,166,055. Still more recently it has been discovered that diblock copolymers of styrene and ethylene butylene functions as an effective compatibilizer for incorporating relatively large amounts of olefin polymers and copolymers into polyphenylene ether resins and compositions thereof.This discovery is disclosed in European Patent ApplicationNO 82 110 688 filed November 19, 1982. INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION The discovery has now also been made that diblockA B copolymers of an alkenyl aromatic compound, A, and a conjugated diene, B, are useful to compatibilize no greater than about 20 parts by weight, based on the total resin weight, of an olefin polymer or copolymer in a polyphenylene ether resin composition. The resent king of compositions are distinguishable over prior art compositions, in which the polyolefin are employed in an amount greater than about 20 parts per 100 parts of resin. Despite the presence of the smaller amounts of olefin resin in the compositions described herein, impressive improvements in impact strength in the molded article are nevertheless obtaines. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The polyphenylene oxide resins useful in accordance with the present compositions are, as previously indicated, individually well known and readily available. There are, however, various preferred composition components. The preferred polyphenylene ethers are homoand copolymers of the formulaEMI3.1 wherein Q, Q , Q , and Q , are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, hydrocarbon radicals, halohydrocarbon radicals, hydrocarbonoxy radicals and halohydrocarbonoxy radicals, and n represents the total number of monomer units and is an integer of at least about 20, and more usually at least 50. Especially preferred is poly 2,6 dimethyl1,4 phenylene ether. These can be made by following procedures described in the literature such as the patents mentioned above. The diblock A B copolymers of an alkenyl aromatic compound, A, and a conjugated diene, B, are derived from alkenyl aromatic compounds having the formula EMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl or alkenyl groups of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms R3 and R4 are selected from the group consisting of chloro, bromo, hydrogen, and lower alkyl groups of from 1 to 6 cabon atoms and R5 and R6 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and lower 5 alkyl and alkenyl groups of froml to 6 carbon atoms or R5 and. R6 may be concatenated together with a hydrocarbyl group to form a naphthyl group. Specific examples of alkenyl aromatic monomers include styrene, bromostyrene, chlorostyrene, a methylstyrene, para methyl styrene, vinylxylene, divinylbenzene, vinyl naphthalene, and vinyl toluene. There are copolymerized with the polydiene, B, which is derived from, for example, 1,3 butadiene, 2 methyl 1,3 butadiene and 1,3 pentadiene. The A B block copolymers can be made by following procedures which are well known in the art or described in the patent literature, for example, in U.K. Patent No 1,145,923. These polymers are also commercially available, e.g., from Shell Chemicals under the trade designationShellvis 50. Preferably, these are diblock copolymers in which the aliphatic unsaturation, as in block B, has been reduced by hydrogenation. Such copolymers will preferably have the average unsaturation of rubber block B decreased to less than 20 , and more preferably less than 10 of its original value. Hydrogenation can be carried out using a variety of hydrogenating catalysts, such as nickel on Kieselguhr,Raney nickel, copper chromite, molybdenum sulfide, and finely divided platinum or other noble metals on a carrier. Hydrogenation can be conducted at virtually any desired temperature or pressure, e.g., ranging from atmospheric to 3,000 p.s.i.g. 2069 N cm2 and from 750 to 6000F., 23,9 to 315,50C , for up to 24 hours. Such procedures are well known. The olefin resin can be polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, copolymers of ethylene and propylene, as well as copolymers of ethylene and organic esters such as ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene ethyl acrylate, ethylene methyl acrylate, and so forth. These are commercially available or are otherwise prepared from the known teachings. The polyethylene ether resin and compatibilizer can be present in widely ranging proportions, but normally are present in weight amounts of from 40 1 to 1 1 of polyphenylene ether compatibilizer diblock copolymer . For best effectiveness, the polyolefin should be included in amounts of at least about 3, and more usually from about 3 to about 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts of the combined total of polyphenylene ether, compatibilizer and polyolefin i.e., the resin in the composition . Other ingredients can also be included in the compositions. These can be selected from among additives comonly employed with plastics, such as fillers and or reinforcements, strengthening fibers, plasticizers, colorants, dyes, flame retardants, antioxidants, pigments, mold release agents, and so forth. Minor but effective amounts are selected normally ranging from 1 to 50 parts by weight of the total composition weight. The compositions can be prepared using any of the known procedures. In one such procedure, a preblend of the ingredients is formed, extruded in a single or twin screw extruder at a temperature of between 400 and 5500F 204 and 2880C , chopped, cut or ground to smaller size and injection molded at temperatures of from 400 to 5000F 204 to 2880C to desired shape and size. DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS The following examples illustrate the invention.They are intended as preferred embodiments only and not as a limitation on the scope of the invention. All parts are by weight. EXAMPLES 1 3 The ingredients noted below were blended on a mixer and the resultant blends were extruded on a twin screw 28 mm Werner Pfleiderer extruder at 5000C 2880C .
