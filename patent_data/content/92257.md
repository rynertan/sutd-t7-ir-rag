# Removable window insulation system.

## Abstract
A window insulation system comprises a panel formed of a rigid foam insulation board 20 dimensioned less than the in terior casing dimensions of a window. To the periphery of the board, a highly compressible foam strip 26 is secured by a contact type adhesive. The foam strip comprises a laminate of foam webs 36, 38 having an intermediate vapor impermeable membrane 40 of aluminized film. The membrane 40 lies in a plane parallel to the plane of the interior face of the board. A flexible layer 44 completely covers the foam strip and ex tends over opposite faces of the board to reduce tensive stress at the joint between the strip and the board during in sertion or removal of the panel from the casing. The flexible layer 44 may comprise a devorative fabric which completely covers the interior face of the board 20 .
