# A seat slide structure and a latch structure therefor.

## Abstract
A latch structure for a seat slide structure 10 includes a latch member 36 pivoted to the base wall 16 of the movable one 12 of a pair of track members 12, 14 and having a latch portion 40 extending inwardly of the one track member and provided with at least one latched tooth 42 engageable within openings 28,30 in the track mem bers to releasably latch the track members to each other. The latch member is biased to a latched position by a spring 44 anchored between the latch member and the one track member. Where a pair of spaced seat slide structures are each provided with latch structures, simultaneous move ment of the latch members of these structures to released position is effected by interconnecting the latch members with a slightly slack cable 52 . A release level 60 is coaxially pivoted with one of latch members and mounts a pulley 62 engageable with the cable to effect shortening of the cable intermediate the anchored ends thereof and simultaneous movement of the latch members to released position.
