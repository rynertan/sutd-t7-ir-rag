# New metal plastic laminates from polyolefin compositions having high impact resistance and high temperature flow resistance.

## Abstract
Polyolefin compositions having a high level of impact resistance and high temperature flow resistance comprising 30 to 90 weight percent resin containing greater than 50 to less than 75 weight percent of polyolefin and greater than 25 to less than 50 weight percent elastomer, and 10 to 70 weight percent filler are described. Metal plastic laminates are pre pared by sandwiching a plastic sheet prepared from the polyolefin compositions between two sheets of metal. Figure 2 shows the impact strength of polyolefin resin filler compositions in which the resin filler weight ratio is constant but the elastomer content of the resin varies.
