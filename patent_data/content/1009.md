# A vehicle suspension system.

## Abstract
A vehicle suspension system providing a controlled camber response to the attitude of a vehicle, for example when the vehicle is navigating a turn. The system includes sensors that monitor the magnitude of centrifugal and vertical forces on the vehicle, the direction and degree that the steering wheel is being turned and camber of each wheel with respect to the vehicle body. In response to the sensed change in the vehicle s attitude, monitored by a central control processor, a series of servo mechanisms are activated to alter the camber of each wheel to maximize tyre contact with the road.
