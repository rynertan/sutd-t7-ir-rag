# Filter cartridge.

## Abstract
An annular filter cartridge 26 through which air passes radially as the air moves in a generally toroidal path within an enclosed housing 12 due to rotation of e.g. a computer tape disc 10 , mounted adjacent to the cartridge within the housing. The cartridge includes a rigid annular body sup porting an annular sheet 28 of filter material in a generally conical configuration within the annular body. The body portion is initially formed as two separate, mating parts 30,32 which clamp the sheet of filter material about its inner and outer peripheries when they are joined together.
