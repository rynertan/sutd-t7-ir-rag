## Description
METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF MAGNETIC FIELDS This invention relates to the measurement of magnetic fields and, in particular, to the measurement of magnetic fields using apparatus incorporating optical fibres. It is known to make measurements of the field strength of weak magnetic fibres by means of an interferometer incorporating fibre optic light guides which are subjected to magnetostrictive stress by the magnetic fields. Early work was concerned with measurement of relatively high frequency alternating fields 100Hz , although the measurement of quasi steady state d.c. and low frequency alternating magnetic fields has been demonstrated by using the small signal alternating field superimposed on a steady state or low frequency field. This technique overcomes some problems associated with the sensitivity of the fibre to low frequency thermal and mechanical perturbations. There are practical difficulties associated with the amplitude and frequency of the calibration magnetic field signal, the linear range of the technique and variations in sensitivity caused by hysteresis effects. These difficulties have now been overcome by means of a closed loop d.c. field gradient field fibre magnetometer in which the dynamic magnetostrictive responsivity of the active sensing element is effectively maintained at zero by control of the total bias field using current feedback to a biasing coil. This nulling technique has the advantage that the system is less susceptible to drift and noise associated with the stability of the magnetic calibration signal used to measure the a.c. responsivity, and the closed loop operation of the system ensures a large linear dynamic range, and greatly reduces problems arising due to hysteresis effects in the active magnetostrictive sensing element. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for measuring the strength of a magnetic field comprising a source of optical radiation, a pair of fibre optic radiation guides arranged to carry radiation from said source through said magnetic field, magnetic field sensing means coupled to at least one of said radiation guides to cause the optical path length in said radiation to change in response to variations in the strength of the magnetic field through which said radiation guide passes, detector means fed from said combined means to generate a signal in dependence on interference between the radiation transferred by said radiation guides and feedback means controlled by said signal to cause the magnetic field surrounding at least one of said radiation guides to vary in dependence thereon. The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Figure 1 shows in diagrammatic form a closed loop fibre optic magnetometer. Referring now to the drawing, light from a laser source 1 is launched into a single mode optical fibre Mach Zehnder interferometer, being amplitude divided into the two fibre arms 2,3 by a fibre directional coupler 4 . Sections 5,6 of fibre in each arm are bonded to or coated with a magnetostrictive material, such as nickel or certain forms of metallic glass, in order to form active magnetic field sensing regions. These fibre sections are then placed in separate magnetic fields H1 and H2 7,8 generated using solenoid and helmholtz coil arrangements 9,10 . Light in the two arms is combined using a second fibre directional coupler 11 and the interference signals generated at the interferometer outputs are detected using photodetectors 12 .By modulating the emission frequency of the laser source using a suitable waveform generator 13 a pseudo heterodyne signal recovery scheme is adopted which provides a carrier output signal 14 which contains as its relative phase the instantaneous optical phase information of the fibre interferometer. Demodulation of this carrier is achieved using either a phase tracking unit or a phase locked loop 15 , and provides an output signal 16 directly related to the phase information of the optical fibre interferometer. The magnetic fields H1 and H2 7,8 applied to the sensing fibre regions 5,6 of the interferometer each consist of both a.c. 1 2 1 2 and Hac and d.c. HdC, HdC components. The frequencies of the oscillators 17,18 used to generate the a.c. components of these fields, fl and f2, are chosen such that f1 N f2 1 10 KHz and fl f f2. These a.c. fields create periodic magnetostrictive straining of the fibres which in turn produce a modulation of the optical path lengths in the two fibre arms of the interferometer and give rise to output signals at the demodulator at the frequencies fl and f2. The magnitudes of the signals produced at each frequency are detected using synchronous detectors 19,20 tuned to the respective frequency. As a result of the nature of magnetostrictions in ferromagnetic materials the amplitude of the periodic magnetstraining produced in the two fibre arms by the a.c. fields, H1 and H2 ac, is proportional to the total d.c. field present at ac ac each sensing region.If the external d.c. fields 21,22 earths 1 at each sensing region are denoted as H1ext and Hext 2 field at each sensing region are denoted as Hext and 11ext then the total d.c. fields at each sensing region are EMI3.1 The output voltage 23 of the synchronous detector 19 tuned to fl is therefore proportional to the magnitude of the total d.c. field HdC HeXt experienced by the field sensing region 5 of fibre arm 1, and likewise the output 24 of the second synchronous detector 20 is proportional to Hd2 H2 . c ext In the closed loop system described here, the output voltages 23,24 of the synchronous detectors are integrated and fed back, using simple electronic circuits 25,26 , to form the current supplied to the two d.c. field coils used to generate the fields H1 and H2 With an overall negative feedback arrange dc has ment this configuration has a stable operating point with the outputs 23,24 of the two synchronous detectors 19,20 at zero. This condition, which corresponds to that of zero a.c. magnetostrictive responsitivity in the sensing regions, 5,6 , arises when H1dc H1extand Hdc 2 H2ext i.e. H1 total H2total 0.Gradient field information is then extracted from the difference in the voltages applied to the coils used to generate H1dc and H2dc obtained using a difference amplifier 27 , whereas the mean total field information is obtained from the sum of these voltages via a summing amplifier 28 .
