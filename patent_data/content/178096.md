## Description
This invention is related to color matching a paint to a colored surface and in particular to an improved process for matching a paint containing flake pigments to a painted surface containing flake pigments. Automobiles and trucks are painted with a wide variety of paints such as acrylic or nitrocellulose lacquers, acrylic, polyurethane, polyester or alkyd enamels and the like. A good color match to the above original paints on repair or refinishing of these paints has been difficult to obtain in some cases. In particular, some paints that contain metallic flake pigments are very difficult to color match since the flake orients itself to the surface of the painted substrate differently with each paint and unless the paint used for refinishing or to make a repair allows the metallic flake pigments to orient in the same manner as in the original paint, the color will not match, particularly, when viewed from different angles. The aforementioned problems occur on refinishing of automobiles and trucks and also at a manufacturing plant where repairs are made at the completion of assembly of the automobile or truck. A method is required that provides for the addition of a composition which changes and randomizes the orientation of the metallic flake in the paint used for refinishing or repair. The improved process of this invention provides for the addition of the aforementioned composition to paints used for refinishing or repair of automobiles and trucks. An improved process for matching the color characteristics of a paint containing film forming binder, a liquid carrier, colored pigments and flake pigments to the color characteristics of a surface layer that contains flake pigments the improvement comprises the following Problems of matching the color characteristics of a repair or refinish paint occur when the finish that is being repaired or refinished is a crosslinked enamel containing flake pigments and the paint used for repair or refinish is a lacquer like paint. The drying and film shrinkage characteristics of an enamel paint film do not allow flake pigments to become completely oriented in parallel to the surface of the substrate that was painted. The lacquer like repair or refinish paint does allow for a more complete parallel orientation of the flake pigments to the surface. The addition of transparent or semitransparent extender pigments such as glass beads to the repair or refinish paint provides for random disorientation of flake pigments to the extent necessary to match the color characteristics of the surface being repainted or repaired. In a typical procedure for matching the color of a refinish or a repair paint to the color of an original finish containing flake pigments that is being repaired or repainted, the pigmentation of the original finish is obtained from known paint formulas, from past experience with the particular paint or from a color computer. Appropriate amounts of tintings which are a dispersion of colored pigments, polymeric dispersants and solvents and flake pigment dispersion are added to an unpigmented clear polymer solution and adjustments are made with tintings to obtain a visual color match. The resulting paint is reduced to a spray viscosity with appropriate solvents and sprayed onto a metal substrate and dried. A visual color comparison to the original finish is made and color values at three angles are made with an absolute spectrophotometer, shown in Lee et al. U.S. 4,412,744 issued November 1, 1983. The flop index also is measured. Flop index is determined by the following formula where L₁ is the head on brightness value, L₂ is the flat angle lightness value, and L₃ is the high angle lightness value each of the above values are measured by the aforementioned spectrophotometer. K, a and b are constants. These color values and the flop index values are compared to color values of the original finish and a flop index value of the original finish. If an acceptable color match can be obtained, the refinish paint is applied. If a color match cannot be obtained, particularly if the flop index value of the original finish is lower than the flop index value of the refinish paint, the following procedure is used As above, the pigmentation is determined. Appropriate amounts of tintings, solvents, flake dispersion and polymer solution are added and then a dispersion comprising liquid carrier, dispersing agent and transparent or semitransparent extender pigments are added. The composition then is reduced to a spray viscosity and sprayed onto the substrate and dried. Color values, lightness values and flop index value are measured and if necessary additional tintings and or dispersion of extender pigments are added to obtain color values and flop index values that match the original finish. The dispersion contains about 5 to 35 by weight of a liquid carrier, 10 to 40 by weight of a dispersing resin or agent and 20 to 60 by weight of extender pigments. The dispersion is prepared by blending the constituents together and charging them into a sand mill or other dispersing equipment and grinding to form a dispersion. The liquid carrier of the dispersion can be any of the conventional organic solvents which will keep the dispersing agent, which usually is a resin, soluble. Typical solvents that can be used are amyl acetate, butyl acetate, xylene and mixtures thereof. Water can be used as a solvent if the paint is a water based composition. The dispersing agent then used is water soluble or water dispersible. The dispersing agent used in the composition preferably is a soluble resin or can be a typical organic dispersing agent. Useful resins contain an acrylic segment such as an alkyl methacrylate like methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, an alkyl acrylate like butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, a hydroxyl containing constituent such as a hydroxy alkyl methacrylate or acrylate like hydroxy ethyl methacrylate, hydroxy propyl methacrylate, hydroxy butyl methacrylate, hydroxy ethyl acrylate, hydroxy propyl acrylate, hydroxy butyl acrylate and the like. Also, the resin can contain an alkyl amino alkyl methacrylate or acrylate such as diethylamino ethyl methacrylate or t butyl aminoethyl methacrylate. The resin also contains a drying oil constituent. Typical drying oil constituents that are readily polymerized with the aforementioned acrylic constituents are vinyl oxazoline drying oil esters of linseed oil fatty acids, tall oil fatty acids, tung oil fatty acids and the like. One preferred resin contains an alkyl methacrylate, alkyl acrylate, hydroxy alkyl acrylate, alkylamino alkyl acrylate and vinyl oxazoline ester of drying oil fatty acids. Typical transparent or semitransparent extender pigments that are used are coarse and fine barytes, crystalline silica, aluminum silicate, hollow glass spheres, solid glass spheres or mixtures of the above. Typically, these transparent or semitransparent particles have a particle diameter in the range of about 0.1 50 microns. Preferably, hollow glass spheres are used that have a diameter of about 0.1 50 microns and preferably about 0.1 20 microns and have a specific gravity of about 2 2.5. These beads have a relatively low specific gravity and are resistant to settling out. Particularly preferred are Zeeospheres of the type 0 5, 0 8, 0 12, 0 16, 0 20, 0 45, 200, 400, 0 300 and 16 300. These hollow glass spheres are sold by Zeelan Industries, Inc. One preferred type is 200 having a mean diameter, by volume, of about 5.8 microns and a particle size distribution, by volume, of 90 of the particles having 10.8 micron diameter or less, 50 of the particles having 4.7 micron diameter or less, 10 of the particles having 2.3 micron diameter or less.

Clear coat color coat finishes on automobiles and trucks can be repaired or refinished with the above paints. The color coat or pigmented coat is matched by the process of this invention and then a clear coat of a conventional lacquer or enamel is applied over the color coat and dried. Typical acrylic refinish paints that can be used in the process of this invention are shown in Walus et al U.S. 3,488,307 issued January 6, 1970, Donatello et al U.S. 3,553,124 issued January 5, 1971, Willey U.S. 3,711,433 issued January 16,1973, Meyer U.S. 4,168,249 issued September 18, 1979 and Fry U.S. 4,451,600 issued May 29, 1984. Typical acrylic alkyd refinish paints that can be used are shown in Miller et a U.S. 3,585,160 issued June 15, 1971, Miller U.S. 3,753,935 issued August 21, 1983 and Miller U.S. 3,844,993 issued October 29, 1974. Typical acrylic polyurethane enamels that can be used are shown in Vasta U.S. 3,558,564 issued January 26, 1971 and Crawley et al U.S. 4,131,571 issued December 26, 1978. Typical alkyd resin paints that can be used are shown in Miller U.S. 3,789,037 issued January 29, 1974. Nitrocellulose lacquers that can be used contain nitrocellulose resin having a viscosity of about 1 2 6 seconds as the binder. Preferably, a blend of nitrocellulose resins are used. One useful blend contains about 1 20 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of 5 6 second viscosity nitrocellulose and 40 by weight, based on the weight of the binder of 1 2 second nitrocellulose. Optionally, the lacquer can contain about 0.5 15 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of ester gum and 5 35 by weight of castor oil. The aforementioned paints contain conventional colored pigments and the flake pigments.

The process of this invention can be used to prepare paints at a paint manufacturing plant that will match known colors of paints currently in use on automobiles and trucks. This is known in the paint trade as a Factory Package . Factory Package paints can be made under controlled process conditions and matched to known colors currently in use. The addition of transparent or semitransparent pigments as discussed above make it possible to obtain color matches to known colors. The process of this invention also can be used to style paints. Transparent or semitransparent extender pigments such as hollow glass beads are added to a paint containing flake pigments such as aluminum flake or the above pearl pigments in an amount sufficient to obtain the desired glamour for a finish of the paint. Another aspect of this invention is to add colored pigment dispersions and flake dispersion to a dispersion containing the aforementioned extender pigments in sufficient amounts to match the color characteristics of a surface that is being painted. The following examples illustrate the invention. All parts and percentages are on a weight basis unless indicated otherwise. The following aluminum tinting and polymer solutions were prepared and blended together to form an aluminum premix The above constituents were thoroughly blended together to form the aluminum tinting. The above constituents were thoroughly blended together to form a polymer solution. The above constituents were thoroughly blended together to form a polymer solution. An aluminum premix was prepared by blending the following constituents An aluminum paint was prepared by adding 12.78 parts by weight of the above acrylic resin dispersion used to make the aluminum tinting to 592.6 parts of aluminum premix and thoroughly mixing the acrylic resin dispersion and premix. The resulting paint had an aluminum pigment volume concentration of 10.9 and an aluminum binder ratio of about 30 100. The above paint was reduced to a spray viscosity with conventional thinner solvents and sprayed onto a primed steel panel. A clear composition of an acrylic urethane polymer was then sprayed over the aluminum paint on the panel and dried at ambient temperature for about 8 hours. Readings were taken on the panel with an absolute colorimeter described in U.S. Patent 4,412,744 issued on November 1, 1983 to Lee and Reilly at three different angles, i.e., near specular, flat and high, and are shown respectively as L₁ L₂ and L₃ on the Table. L₁ is also known as head on brightness, L₂ as flat angle lightness and L₃ as high angle lightness. The Flop Index was also calculated. The aluminum paint prepared above which was without extender pigments is the control to which paints containing extender pigments were compared. A conventional technique for adjusting the Flop Index and lightness of a paint containing flake is to add a dispersion of titanium dioxide pigment. In many cases, titanium dioxide pigment masks the appearance of the aluminum flake at the high angle lightness, L₃, and produces a ring like effect which is known as a bulls eye effect which is an unacceptable repair for a finish. The following dispersions 2 13 were added to the above aluminum premix at the same pigment volume concentration as the titanium dioxide pigment was added. The lightness values and Flop Index Values were measured and are shown in the Table and can be compared to the values obtained with titanium dioxide pigment. The above constituents are charged into a sand mill and ground to form a uniform dispersion. The following constituents are mixed together to form a white tinting 36.04 Parts by weight of the above white tinting are added to 592.6 parts by weight of the aluminum premix prepared above to provide a titanium dioxide pigment volume concentration of 4.5 and an aluminum binder weight ratio of 30 100. The resulting composition was reduced to a spray viscosity and sprayed onto a primed steel panel. A clear composition of an acrylic urethane was sprayed over the above applied composition and dried at ambient temperatures as above and color measurements were made and are recorded in the Table. Versus the control, the measurements show a decrease in head on brightness, L₁, an increase in flat angle lightness, L₂, and a large increase in high angle lightness L₃ and a decrease in Flop Index. These data show that by using titanium dioxide pigment, a large increase in high angle lightness, L₃, is obtained and in general a good color match using titanium dioxide pigment cannot be expected. The above constituents were charged into a sand mill and ground to form a dispersion. 28.18 parts by weight of the above barytes dispersion and 7.05 parts by weight of the acrylic resin dispersion, described above, were added to 592.6 parts by weight of the aluminum premix prepared above to provide a barytes pigment volume concentration of 4.5 and an aluminum binder weight ratio of 30 100. The resulting composition was reduced to a spray viscosity and sprayed onto a primed steel panel. A clear composition of an acrylic urethane was sprayed over the applied composition and dried at ambient temperatures as above and color measurements were made and are recorded in the Table. The measurements in comparison to the control show a decrease in head on brightness, L₁, an increase in flat angle lightness, L₂, and an increase in high angle lightness, L₃, but not as great as with titanium dioxide and a decrease in the Flop Index. The above data, in particular the high angle lightness data, indicates that a better color match can be made using barytes dispersion in comparison to a titanium dioxide pigment dispersion. The dispersion is prepared the same as above coarse barytes dispersion except low micron barytes extender pigment having a weight average particle size of 0.3 to 30 microns having an effective diameter of 6 microns was used for the coarse barytes extender pigment. As above, the low micron barytes dispersion was added in the same amount to the acrylic resin dispersion and to the aluminum premix prepared above and the resulting composition was reduced to a spray viscosity and sprayed onto a steel panel. A clear composition of an acrylic urethane was sprayed over the applied composition and dried at ambient temperatures as above and color measurements were made and are recorded in the Table. The results are similar to those of the above aluminum paint containing coarse barytes extender pigment but the low micron barytes dispersion did not move the L₁, L₂, L₃ and Flop Index Values as far as the coarse barytes. The above constituents were charged into a sand mill and ground to form a dispersion. 20.63 parts by weight of the above aluminum silicate dispersion and 7.06 parts by weight of the acrylic resin dispersion, described above were added to 592.6 parts by weight of the aluminum premix prepared above to provide an aluminum silicate pigment volume concentration of 4.5 and an aluminum binder weight ratio of 30 100. The resulting composition was reduced to a spray viscosity and sprayed onto a primed steel panel. A clear composition of an acrylic urethane was sprayed over the applied composition and dried at ambient temperatures as above and color measurements were made and are recorded in the Table. The measurements in comparison to the control show a slight decrease in head on brightness, L₁, only a slight increase in flat angle lightness, L₂, and a slight increase in high angle lightness, L₃. The Flop Index decreased only slightly. The above data indicates that only a slight change can be obtained for L₁, L₂ and L₃ values using aluminum silicate due to its small particle size. The above constituents were charged into a sand mill and ground to form a dispersion. 19.79 Parts by weight of the above glass bead dispersion and 7.0 parts by weight of the acrylic resin dispersion were added to 592.6 parts by weight of the aluminum premix prepared above to provide a glass bead pigment volume concentration of 4.5 and an aluminum binder weight ratio of 30 100. The resulting composition was reduced to a spray viscosity and sprayed onto a primed steel panel. A clear composition of an acrylic urethane was sprayed over the applied composition and dried at ambient temperatures as above and color measurements were made and are recorded in the Table. The measurements in comparison to the control showed a decrease in head on brightness, L₁, an increase in flat angle lightness, L₂, and a slight increase in high angle lightness, L₃ and a decrease in Flop Index. The above data, in particular the high angle lightness data, indicates that a better color match could be obtained using a glass bead dispersion in comparison to a titanium dioxide pigment dispersion. Seven additional glass bead dispersions were prepared using the above constituents to form the dispersion, except the following glass beads were used in place of the Zeeospheres 0 5 Hollow glass beads Each of the above dispersions were formulated into a paint using the same constituents as used to form aforementioned aluminum paint except one of the above glass bead dispersions were substituted for the No. 5 Glass bead dispersion. In each case, the resulting composition was reduced to a spray viscosity and sprayed onto a primed steel panel and a clear composition of an acrylic urethane was sprayed over the applied composition and dried at ambient temperatures and color measurements were made and recorded in the Table. In general, the measurements in comparison to the control had decreased head on brightness, L₁, an increase in flat angle lightness, L₂, and an increase in high angle lightness, L₃. Flop Index and lightness values showed that as the glass bead sizes increase, L₁ values decrease, L₂ values increase, L₃ values increase and Flop Index Values decrease. In general, the high angle lightness data indicates that a better color match can be obtained by using glass bead dispersions than titanium dioxide pigment dispersions. The above constituents were charged into a sand mill and ground to form a dispersion. 21.95 Parts of the above silica dispersion and 6.85 parts by weight of the acrylic resin dispersion were added to 592.6 parts by weight of the aluminum premix prepared above to provide a silica pigment volume concentration of 4.5 and an aluminum to binder content weight ratio of 30 100. A clear composition of an acrylic urethane was sprayed over the applied composition and dried at ambient temperatures as above and color measurements were made and are recorded in the Table. The measurements in comparison to the control showed a decrease in head on brightness, L₁, an increase in flat angle lightness, L₂, an increase in high angle lightness, L₃ and a decrease in the Flop Index. The above data indicates that a better color match can be obtained with a silica dispersion than can be obtained with a titanium dioxide pigment dispersion.
