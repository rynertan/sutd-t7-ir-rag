# A machining centre.

## Abstract
A machining center utilizing a traveling electrode EDM machine 40 in which a thin, continuous electrode element E is supplied, transported, guided over a guide member 1 and taken up to provide a continuously renewed span of electrode surface traveling over the guide member juxtaposed in elec troerosive relationship with a workpiece W . The guide member has a guide surface 1a formed to impart a pre selected geometry to the span of the electrode element and is detachably secured to a guide holder 50 in the machine. The machining center includes a guide storage station 20 for accepting a plurality of guide members the guide surfaces of which are different in geometry. A guide changing device 30 is operatively associated between the storage station and the machine to exchange guide member therebetween. The machine is also provided with an electrode handling unit 60 for loading the electrode element onto the guide member transferred from the storage station and unloading the elec trode element from that guide member to enable the latter to be removed by the changing device and transferred thereby back to the storage station. A numerical control unit 10 is provided to furnish control commands to enable the system functions to be automatically performed.
