# A process for producing an optically active 3 3,4 dihydroxphenyl serine and a proteced derivative thereof.

## Abstract
N acyl DL 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl serine or a catecholic hydroxyl protected derivative thereof is stereospecifically de acylated by reaction with a microorganism of Streptomyces or Streptoverticillium having an acylase or with an extract of said microorganism containing said acylase, to produce L 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl serine or the hydroxyl protected derivative thereof, with the N acyl D 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl serine com pound remaining unaltered. The L 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl serine compound so produced can be separated from the N acyl D 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl serine compound owing to its different properties.
