# Stripping compositions and method of stripping resists.

## Abstract
Stripping compositions for removing resist materials from substrates comprise compositions of a 2 pyrrolidi none compound and a diethylene glycol monoalkyl ether compound. Polyethylene glycol may be added to provide even more effective stripping compositions.
