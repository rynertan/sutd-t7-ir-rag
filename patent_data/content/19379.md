# A recording medium for a digital optical memory, and a memory using such a medium.

## Abstract
A recording medium 12 for a digital optical memory uses periodic clock pulses pre recorded on each servo track 13 of an optical medium usually disc shaped to provide a local self synchronizing source of clock frequency information for read only or direct read after write optical digital memories. In keeping with accepted practices, the servo track or tracks additionally function as references for controlling the positioning of a read head or a read write head of such a memory relative to the data tracks 14 .
