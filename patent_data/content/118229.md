# Strain gauges and their method of manufacture.

## Abstract
An electrical strain gauge and a method for its manufac ture in which the strain responsive circuit element is formed from a thin film deposit 2 on a surface of a metal substrate 4 on which an insulating film 10 has already been deposited. Connections are made directly to the circuit element by the ends of conector leads 6 that are bonded into insulating plugs 8 in apertures in the substrate. The plugs and the insulating film are glasses to which the substrate and the circuit element are bonded. A further glass layer 14 encapsulates the circuit element. As a result a very robust form of gauge is provided that can be used in high temperatures and in chemically active environments.
