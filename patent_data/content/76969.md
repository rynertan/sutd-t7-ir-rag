# Perpendicular magnetic recording head.

## Abstract
A perpendicular magnetic recording head comprising a pole 20 formed of a highly permeable magnetic thin film facing at the end thereof the magnetic surface of a recording medium 34 , a side member 22 formed of a highly perme able magnetic material joined with the film surface of the pole, a nonmagnetic holder 24a, 24b for holding the pole and the side member from the side surfaces, the nonmag netic holder having coil hole 28a, 28b , and an exciting coil 26 wound around the pole via the side member through the coil hole, characterized in that the coil hole is gradually increasing in width from the end of the side member toward the rear.
