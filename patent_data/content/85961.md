# An oxygen injection nozzle.

## Abstract
An apparatus for injecting a mixture of pure oxygen or oxygen enriched air at least 25 percent oxygen and purge water into a wet oxidation reactor 1 operating at elevated temperature and pressure. An annular space 5,15,22,31,39,44 between the oxygen carrying pipe 2,13,20,29,42 and a second, larger pipe 4,14,21,30,38,43 is filled with heat transfer resisting material, either maintained static or passed through the annular space 5,15,22,31,39,44 to remove heat therefrom. The temperature of the oxygen and purge water is maintained at less than 121 C. preferably less than 66 C. to minimise evaporation of the purge water. Thus, backflow of organic matter into the oxygen pipe 2,13,20,29,42 is prevented plugging of the oxygen pipe 2,13,20,29,42 by salts is also prevented.
