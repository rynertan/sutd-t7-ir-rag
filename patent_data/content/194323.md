# Scanning tunneling microscope.

## Abstract
This scanning tunneling microscope consists of a semi conductor chip 7 into which slots are etched to form a central portion 1 linked by a first pair of stripes 2, 3 to an intermediate portion 4 which in turn is linked by a second pair of stripes 5, 6 to the main body of the chip 7 . The pairs of stripes 2, 3 5, 6 have mutually orthogonal directions to allow the center portion 1 to perform movements in x and y directions under the control of electrostatic forces created between the stripes 2, 3 5, 6 and their opposite walls. The center portion 1 has formed into it at least one tongue 17 carrying an integrated, protuding tunnel tip 18 which is capable of being moved in z direction by means of electro static forces between said tongue 17 and the bottom of a cavity below the tongue 17 .
