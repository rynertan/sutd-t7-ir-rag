# Coating of semiconductor wafers and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
In the production of coatings on semiconductor wa fers, fragile equipment is used and also difficulties in obtaining uniform coatings arise. The invention provides a form of boat 10 for holding wafers and a manifold structure 21 for feeding gases to the boats and wafers, which are less fragile cheaper and easier to manufacture and give more uniform coatings. The boats 10 are relatively short, of semi cylindrical form with slots 16 through which gas can flow, and with rails 11, 12, 13, for positioning and holding wafers at correct heights. The manifolds 21 have apertures 35 which are spaced at varying distances along the manifold as 26 compared to the conventional longitudinal slot. The inven tion is particularly applicable to producing oxide coatings and polycrystalline silicon coatings on silicon wafers.
