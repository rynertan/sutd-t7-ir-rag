# Ceramic fiber board.

## Abstract
A flexible ceramic fiber board is formed from fibers with a homogeneous latex binder coating. The coating is formed from a slurry of the latex, a cationic acrylamide base copolymer and aluminum sulfate solution. The cationic copolymer aids the aluminum sulfate in homogeneously depositing the latex and forming a uniformly flexible board. The shape that is formed is dried dielectrically. The crystal line, high Al₂O₃ fibers may be mixed with non crystalline, Al₂O₃ SiO₂ fibers.
