# Alcohol substituted amides and use as chain extenders for polyurethanes.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the reaction products of buty rolactone and an aliphatic amine utilizable as a chain extender and curing agent for castable polyurethanes and to the process employing said products in preparing castable polyurethane elastomers and to the process for preparing the butyrolactone amine adducts. The aliphatic amine reac tants employed in preparing the butyrolactoneamine adducts are defined by the formula X H CHâ‚‚
