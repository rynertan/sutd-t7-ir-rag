## Description
MINIMIZATION OF VOLTAGE DELAY IN Li SOC12 CELLS The present invention is directed to a method for reducing voltage delay encountered in, for example, lithiumthionyl chloride cells. It is known in the art that electrochemical cells having an anode of lithium or other Group I metal have high energy densities, high voltages, wide temperature operating ranges, long shelf life and relatively low cost. In such cells, the type now commonly referred to as the liquid cathodes cell are of particular interest. These cells are described, for example in U.S. Patent No. 3,926,669 and in British Patent No. 1,409,307. In accordance with the teachings of the aforementioned patents, the electrolyte, which is also the cathode, comprises an oxyhalide, for example thionyl chloride. One attractive system is provided through the use of thionyl chloride, a solute of lithium aluminum tetrachloride, a lithium anode and a cathode current collector, which may be for example compressed carbon black. Despite the numerous advantages envisioned for lithium liquid cathode batteries, it has been found that problems occur with these cells. A particular problem has been identified as that of voltage delay particularly occuring when the batteries are stored at elevated temperatures. The voltage delay problem is characterized by two features to wit, a dip in voltage below a defined cutoff voltage and the time required for the voltage to rise back to the cutoff voltage. The problem is believed to result from passivation of the lithium anode due apparently to reactions between the lithium anode and constituents of the electrolyte. In accordance with U.S. Patent No. 4,170,693 it is proposed to minimize the voltage delay problem by coating the lithium anode with a cyanoacrylate polymeric coating. In accordance with U.S. Patent No. 4,296,185 it is proposed to minimize the voltage delay problem by inserting a cyanoacrylate sheet in the cell contiguous to and in physical contact with the anode. It is further taught in U.S. PatentNo. 4,296,185 that this sheet should remain intact and contiguous to the anode during cell operation while allowing lithium ions to pass through it. The e invention is directed to an improvement in the reduction of voltage delay of a lithium oxyhalide cell wherein the lithium is exposed in the cell to a liquid cathode, e.g., SOCl2, in which has been dissolved prior to cell assembly a substance from the group of alkyl cyanoacrylates and acrylic and substituted acrylic ester polymers. No specific anode treatments are necessary nor are any films contiguous to said anode required. Figures 1 to 4 are scanning electron photomicrographs showing surfaces of lithium exposed to thionyl chloride LiA1C14 alone Figures 1 and 3 at room temperature and 710C respectively and thionyl chloride LiAlC14 to which has been added ethyl 2 cyanoacrylate Figures 2 and 4 at room temperature and 710C respectively, In accordance with the invention, the voltage delay of a lithium or a lithium alloy liquid oxyhalide cell is minimized by dissolving in the liquid cathode a cyanoacrylate ester or an acrylic ester polymer prior to adding the solution to the cell. The passivation effect on lithium electrodes appears to result from film formation of lithium halide on the lithium surface. The conditions leading to control of the film are obscure, but it is postulated that weaker films have a lesser tendency to passivate. In order to show to what extent a film forms on a lithium electrode in contact with thionyl chloride electrolytes cathodes, a typical electrolyte was made up with 1.6M LiAlC14 dissolved in SOC12. To a portion of this solution was added ethyl 2 cyanoacrylate in an amount of 61.5 mg per ml of electrolyte. It is presumed, although not known with certainty, that the ethyl 2 cyanoacrylate reacts in some way with the electrolyte to form an acrylic polymer not fully substituted with nitrile groups.Lithium coupons were stored in these solutions for five days, one set at room temperature and the other set at 710C. At room temperature, as shown in Figure 1, the electrolyte without polymer produced a dense passivating film of lithium chloride on the metallic lithium whereas electroylte containing the polymer produced practically no passivating film as shown in Figure 2. At 710cm the polymer free electrolyte produced a thick, massive passivating film as shown in Figure 3, whereas the polymer containing electrolyte produced a very open and loose film of lithium chloride on the metallic lithium. Alkyl 2 cyanoacrylates are unsaturated monomeric esters which polymerize readily at room temperature usually without deliberately added catalysts and which are used as adhesives. Polymerization is usually initiated by moisture present in the atmosphere. The compounds are described in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, John Wiley andSons, 1964, Vol. l, at pages 337 to 342. The acrylic ester polymers are described in the same volume on pages 246 to 328. The anodic embodiments of the invention as depicted in Figures 2 and 4 are best provided by including appropriate polymer in the cathode electrolyte at the time of cell closure.If for some reason this preferred procedure is impractical, a body of acrylic polymer can be provided on the interior of a cell component or components remote from and not contiguous with the anode but in contact with the cathode electrolyte and be permitted to dissolve in the cathode electrolyte subsequent to cell closure. This latter alternative is not considered ideal because undesirable polymer concentration gradients may very well persist in the liquid cathode electrolyte for considerable periods of time. Although the present invention has been described in conjunction with preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that modifications and variations may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as those skilled in the art will readily understand. Such modifications and variations are considered to be within the purview and scope of the invention and appended claims.
