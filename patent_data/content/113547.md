# WIRE TERMINATION TOOL

## Abstract
A tool 32 for making interconnections between electric al wires and a conductive terminal having wire receiving slots therein in a point to point wiring system includes and indexing member 44 for locating and registering wires relative to the slots and a pushing element 56 for engaging such wires and entering the slots to fully insert the wires therein. The indexing member 44 , inclusive of a slotted sleeve axially movable, but rotatively fixed, relative to the pushing element 56 , holds wires for ready alignment with the slots. The pushing element 56 defines a plurality of curved splines 58 at the tip thereof for progressively driving the aligned wires deeper into the centre of the terminals than at the peripheries thereof.
