# Repairable multi level system for semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A multi level integrated circuit packaging system has a primary support frame N , an array of secondary support frames H mounted in said primary support frame and an array of single chip carriers associated with each secondary support frame. An integrated circuit is encapsulated in each single chip carrier, which has an insulated wiring pattern with EC wells and delete lands d . The secondary and primary support frames also have EC pads so that a change capability exists to any electrical signal path terminating on the chip.
