## Description
DESCRIPTION A PHENOL CYAN COUPLER FOR SILVER HALIDE COLOR PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIAL The present invention relates to a novel coupler for forming a cyan dye image and also to a silver halide color photographic material containing said coupler.Normally, a color image is formed by a process in which an oxidation product of a color developing agent produced by reducing a silver halide grain that was exposed to light with an aromatic primary amine color developing agent and the couplers forming a yellow, magenta and cyan dye, respectively, undergo oxidative coupling with each other in a silver halide emulsion. Couplers typically used for forming a cyan dye are those of a phenol or a naphthol. In a phenol, in particular, the fundamental properties heretofore required from the viewpoints of the photographic capability of the coupler, are that the spectral absorption characteristics of the dye should be very good, i.e. there should be no absorption but in a sharp green band in the spectrum of said dye the dye formed should be fast to light, heat, dampness and the like the color developability thereof should be very good, i.e. the dye should have satisfactory color sensitivity and color density there should be no loss of dye even if a bleaching or bleach fix solution comprising principally EDTA ferric salt becomes exhausted. From the viewpoint of environmental pollution prevention, benzyl alcohol should be eliminated from the color developing solution. It is, however, the case that satisfactory color developability cannot be attained, in the normal way, without adding benzyl alcohol. The lowering of color developability caused by the elimination of benzyl alcohol is serious particularly for a phenol cyan coupler, and therefore there is a demand for a highly color developable phenol cyan coupler requiring little or no benzyl alcohol for development. For the purpose of satisfying the abovementioned requirements, various studies have been conducted but so far, there has not been found any cyan coupler satisfying all the required properties. For example 6 2,4 di t amylphenoxy butanamide 2,4 di chloro 3 methyl phenol described in U.S. Patent 2,801,171 has excellent light resistance but is defective in its thermal resistance and besides. the loss of color dye is considerable when a fatigued bleach fix solution is used. It depends greatly on benzyl alcohol for color development dependence, so that it is difficult to eliminate benzyl alcohol from the color developing solution. 2 Heptafluorobutanamide 5 a 2 ,4 di t amylphenoxy hexanamide3phenol, described in U.S. Patent 2,815,826 has excellent thermal resistance and the loss of color dyes in a fatigued bleach fix bath is slight but it has poor light resistance and color developability.Of the couplers described in Japanese Patent PublicationOpen to Public Inspection No. 109630 1978 hereinafter referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication , the elimination of benzyl alcohol still remains a problem as does their light resistance. Further, the phenol type cyan couplers described in U.S. Patent 3,839,044 Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publications37425 1972, 10135 1975, 117422 1975, 130441 1975, 108841 1975 and 120334 1975 Japanese Patent Publication 36894 1973 and the like also possess unsatisfactory thermal resistance and developability in the absence of benzyl alcohol. With the phenol type couplers having an ureido group at the 2 position described in British Patent 1,011,940 U.S.Patents3,446,622, 3,996,253, 3,758,308 and 3,880,661 and the like, the cyan dyes formed therefrom are not desirable from a color reproduction viewpoint, because their spectral absorption is broad and because the dyes each absorb considerably in the green band of the spectrum because there is an absorption maximum in the red band relatively close to the shortwave length area. The phenol couplers having an ureido group at the 2 position described in JapanesePatent O.P.I. Publication 65134 1981 are better as regards green absorption, but their other characteristics are not fully satisfactory. We have now found, according to the present invention, a group of couplers which satisfy the various requirements for such phenol cyan couplers. The present invention provides a phenol cyan coupler for silver halide color photographic material comprising a phenol nucleus substituted by a group represented by the following Formula I or Formula II at the 2 position and by an acylamino group at the 5position.

To the cyan dye forming couplers of this invention, any process or technique for the ordinary types of cyan dye forming couplers can similarly be applied. Typically, a photographic element is formed by incorporating the coupler into a silver halide emulsion and said emulsion is then coated over a substrate. Such a photographic element may be a monochromatic or a multichromatic element. Said multichromatic element has a non sensitizing emulsion or a color dye image forming constituent unit which is sensitive respectively to the area of each of the three primary colors in the spectrum, though the cyan dye forming couplers of the invention are usually held in a red sensitive emulsion each of said constituent units may be composed of a single emulsion layer or a multi coated emulsion layer which is sensitive to a certain area of the spectrum. As is well known by those skilled in the art, the layers of said elements including said image forming constituent units can be arranged in various orders.A typical multichromatic photographic element comprises a cyan dye image forming constituent unit comprising at least one red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer having at least one cyan dye forming coupler at least one of said cyan dye forming couplers being a coupler of the invention and a yellow image forming constituent unit comprising at least one blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer having at least one magenta dye forming coupler, supported on a substrate. Said element can be provided with additional layers such as a filter layer, an inter layer, a protective layer and a subbing layer. In order to incorporate the couplers of the invention in an emulsion conventional processes can be used. For example, a silver halide emulsion to be used in the invention can be prepared by using an organic solvent having a boiling point of no lower than l750C such as tricresylphosphate and dibutylphthalate or a solvent having a low boiling point such as butyl acetate and butyl propionate, or a mixed solution thereof as occasion demands, to dissolve the couplers of the invention independently or together, and the solution thus obtained is mixed with an aqueous gelatin solution containing a surface active agent emulsification can be carried out by means of a high speed rotary mixer or a colloid mill, and then a silver halide is added to the thus emulsified matter.When the couplers of the invention are to be added to a silver halide emulsion, the amount of said coupler is typically 0.07 to 0.7 mol, more preferably 0.1 to 0.4 mol, per mol of silver halide. The silver halide to be used in a silver halide emulsion of the invention includes any silver halide used in an ordinary silver halide emulsion, for example silver bromide, silver chloride, silver iodobromide, silver chlorobromide or silver chloriodobromide. Silver halide emulsions constituting a silver halide emulsion of the invention can be prepared by a variety of processes including those usually carried out, including, for example, the process as described inJapanese Patent Examined Publication No. 7772 1971, wherein an emulsion of silver salt grains comprising at least one part of silver salts whose solubility is greater than that of silver bromide is prepared, and then, at least one part of said grains is converted into silver bromide or silver iodobromide, that is, the so called conversion emulsion, or a process for preparing aLippmann emulsion comprising a fine grain silver halide having an average grain diameter not larger than 0.1 . Silver halide emulsions of the invention can be chemically sensitized by making use of one or more of a sulphur sensitizer such as allylthiocarbazide, thiourea or cystine, an active or inactive selenium sensitizer a reduction sensitizer such as stannour salt or polyamine a noble metal sensitizer such as a gold sensitizer, more specifically potassium aurithiocyanate, potassium chloroaurate or 2 auro sulfobenzthiazole methyl chloride or a water soluble salt sensitizer such as a ruthenium salt, rhodium salt or iridium salt, and more specifically ammonium chloropalladÅate, potassium chloroplatinate or sodium chloropalladide. Silver halide emulsions of the invention may contain a variety of known photographic additives. For example, the photographic additives described in ResearchDisclosure , Dec., 1978, Article 17643 can be used. For the purpose of providing sensitiveness to a photosensitive wavelength range necessary for a redsensitive emulsion, the silver halide of the invention can be spectrally sensitized by selecting suitable sensitizing dyes. A variety of spectrally sensitizing dyes can be used and more than one can be used. In the invention, the spectrally sensitizing dyes used advantageously are typically cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes or complex cyanine dyes, as described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,269,234, 2,270,378, 2,442,710, 2,454,520 and 2,776,280. Color developing solutions which can be used in the present invention are preferably those having an aromatic primary amine color developing agent as the principal component. Concrete examples of said color developing agents include those of the p phenylene diamine type, inter alia, diethyl p phenylenediamine chloride, monomethyl p phenylene diamine chloride, dimethyl pphenylene diamine chloride, 2 amino 5 diethylamino toluene chloride, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N dodecylamino toluene, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N 0 methane sulfonamide ethyl amino toluene chloride, 4 N ethyl N ss methane sulfonamide ethylamino aniline, 4 N ethyl N ss hydroxy ethylamino aniline and 2 amino 5 N ethyl N B methoxy ethyl amino toluene. After developing, the processes ordinarily carried out in succession for bleaching, fixing or bleaching fixing, washing and drying, in order to remove silver and silver halide, can be used. The following Examples further illustrate the present invention. Example 1 There were taken 0.03 mol each of the couplers of the invention indicated in Table 1 and the undermentioned control couplers, A , B and C to add respectively into each of the mixed solutions of dibutyl phthalate whose amount was equivalent to the weight of said coupler added and ethyl acetate whose amount was three times as much as the weight of said coupler added, and then the dissolution was completed by raising the temperature up to 60 C. And each of the coupler dispersion solution was prepared in the process that the solution thus obtained was added into the aqueous solution of Alkanol B alkylnaphthalene sulfonate mfd. by Du Pont and gelatin, and the emulsification was made by means of a colloid mill.Next, each of said coupler dispersion solutions was added into silver chlorobromide emulsion of 0.1 mol in silver equivalent 20 mol thereof were silver bromide and thus obtained solution was coated on a sheet of polyethylene laminated paper and was then dried up, and thus, six kinds, in all, of the silver halide color photographic materials Sample No. 11 6 having the stably coated layer were obtained, respectively.Control Coupler A EMI33.1 EMI34.1 Each of these samples was exposed to light through a wedge and then processed as mentioned hereunder, provided that the color developing processes were carried out respectively on the two kinds of the compositions, i.e. the composite added with benzyl alcohol Color development 1 and the composite without addition thereof Color development 2 .
