# NOVEL TITANIUM HALIDE CONTAINING CATALYST

## Abstract
A novel catalyst system for the polymerization of alpha olefins is provided. The catalyst system comprises a an organoaluminum containing component, e.g. triethyl aluminum, and b a titanium halide containing component. The titanium halide containing component is obtained by reacting a halogen containing magnesium compound, e.g. MgCl₂, with an organic phosphite, e.g. triphenyl phosphite, to produce a reaction product. The reaction product is then co pulverized with a complex of a titanium halide compound and an electron donor compound, e.g. TiCl₄ ethyl benzoate, to produce a co pulverized product. The co pulverized pro duct is then reacted with a titanium halide compound, e.g. TiCl₄. A novel titanium halide containing component is pro vided as well as a process for producing said component. A process for the polymerization of alpha olefins is also provided.
