# X ray tube for generating soft X rays.

## Abstract
In an X raytube, particularly for the detection of elements having a low atomic number by X ray spectral analysis, an anode support 4 is on the target side provided with a layer 7 of scandium. The scandium disc is provided on the anode by adhesion via an intermediate layer 8 , preferably of chromium. In a relection tube, the anode block supporting the intermediate layer and the scandium layer is preferably made of silver or copper. In a transmission tube, the scandium is provided on a beryllium disc which acts as intermediate layer and as an exit window 6 .
