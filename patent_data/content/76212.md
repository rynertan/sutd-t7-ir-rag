# A method for preparing 1 aryl 3 arylamino 2 pyrazolin 5 ones.

## Abstract
A method for preparing a 1 aryl 3 arylamino 2 pyrazolin 5 one comprises reacting an N aryl 3 arylamino 3 oximinopropionamide with an acylating agent in an inert solvent, then heating in contact with a strong acid catalyst and a dehydrating agent in an inert solvent, and then heating in contact with an acid in water and a lower alkanol. The 1 aryl 3 arylamino 2 pyrazolin 5 one may be used as a color forming coupler or as an intermediate in preparing a color forming coupler which produces a dye in a photo graphic element.
