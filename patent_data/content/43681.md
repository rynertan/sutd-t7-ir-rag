# Catalytic process for manufacture of lubricating oils.

## Abstract
This invention describes a process for preparing a high viscosity index low pour point lube base stock from an asphalt free heavy hydrocarbon oil by first catalytically dewaxing the heavy oil with a catalyst comprising a zeolite having a Con straint Index of 1 to 12 and then hydrocracking or hydroconver ting the dewaxed oil with a large pore zeolite catalyst such as dealuminized Y or ZSM 20 associated with palladium The vis cosity index is controlled by the severity of the hydroconver sion step.
