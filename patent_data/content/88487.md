# Semiconductor device, e.g. for controlling a thermal printing head.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device which is used, for example, for controlling and driving thermal heads of a thermal printer facsimile apparatus, comprises a first circuit 1 activated when power is supplied to the semiconductor device and a second circuit 2 activated only when both power and a signal from a power control circuit 7 are applied to the semiconductor device. In the facsmile apparatus, data stor ing circuits 8 form part of the second circuit and are activated from a power switching circuit 6 receiving the control signal when the thermal heads are to print on the record medium data elements provided by output buffer circuits 11 . These form part of the first circuit and are controlled by the data storing circuits. The activation of the second circuit is removed when printing of the data ele ments is completed and the record medium is to be ad vanced to the next printing position.
