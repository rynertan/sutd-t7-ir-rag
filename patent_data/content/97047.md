## Description
The present invention relates to the hydrogenation of organic compounds by use of novel catalysts comprised of a one or more metals from Group VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements, b solid porous particles, and c alumina and silica at a weight ratio of 0.3 1 to 1 0.3 respectively. Coprecipitation of nickel and silicate salts from aqueous solutions in the presence of porous silica or alumina particles to increase the surface area of a catalyst was first disclosed in U.S. Patent No.3.371,050 to Taylor and Sinfelt. It was later discovered by J. L. Carter tis, S. Patent Nos. 3,697,445 3,859,370 and 3,868,332 that controlled addition of sodium metasilicate in the process of the 050 patent further increases the total surface area of the catalyst as well as the reduced nickel surface area thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of such catalysts.Carter and Barnett U. S. Patent No. 4,251,672 later found that the addition of copper salts during coprecipitation enables one to reduce the catalyst at 2000C rather than at 4009C and concurrently achieve relatively high hydrogenation activities. Subsequently, Carter,Barnett, and Sinfelt U. S. Patent No. 4,263,225 found that by a judicious blend of nickel, cobalt and copper salts during coprecipitation in the presence of sodium metasilicate and kieselguhr, produced a catalyst having extremely high catalytic activities when the catalyst is reduced at 2000C. However, the catalytic activity of such trimetallic catalyst dramatically falls off when the catalyst is reduced at 4000C. Recently, Halluin and Barnett U. S. PatentNos. 4,273,680 and 4,273,929 discovered that by replacement of the sodium metasilicate in the process ofU. S. Patent No. 3,697,445 with aluminum salts one enhances the catalytic hydrogenation activity of the catalyst. The activity is further enhanced if small amounts of magnesium salts are added during coprecipitation U. S. Patent No. 4,307,248 to Barnett andHalluin . Such a pronounced enhancement in activity, however, was not manifested in the catalyst when copper and or cobalt salts were added during coprecipitation, particularly those metal blend catalysts which were reduced at 2000C. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a coprecipitated catalyst support composition as well as novel catalysts resulting therefrom.The catalysts of the present invention are characterized by relatively high activity and stability at elevated temperatures. The calcined support catalyst comprises a one or more metals which are catalytically active for the hydrogenation of organic compounds b alumina and silica at a weight ratio of 0.3 1 to 1 0.3 respectively and c solid porous particles, the catalysts being characterised as having a B.E.T. total surface 2 area ranging from about 150 to about 350 m2 g wherein the total anount of catalytically active metal in the catalyst ranges from about 10 wt. to about 70 wt.X based on the total weight of the catalyst after calcination and reduction, where one or more of said metals are selected from Group.VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements and from about 0.1 to 10 wt. where the said catalytically active metal is ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridiun, platinum or a mixture thereof, andwherein the catalyst has been prepared by aa coprecipitating ions of one or more catalytically active metals, aluminium ions and silicate ions, with the solid porous particles or by impregnating a support ..composition .comprising the alumina and silica of b above and solid porous particles, with the catalytically active metal , bb drying the catalyst, and cc calcining 0 the dried catalyst at a teuperature from about 300 C to 4500C. The coprecipitated catalyst support composition of the present invention comprises a aluminum, one or more salts of aluminum, or one or more oxides of aluminum b silicon, one or more salts of silicon, or one or more oxides of silicon and c solid porous particles. The support composition of the present invention is prepared by a preparing an aqueous reaction mixture comprising aa at least one water soluble aluminum salt, ab at least one water soluble silicate, and ac solid porous particles b heating the aqueous reaction mixture and c adding an alkaline precipitating agent to the heated reaction mixture to coprecipitate aluminum ions and silicate ions in the presence of the solid porous particles. One method for preparing a catalyst of the present invention is by coprecipitating the aluminum and silicate ions with one or more catalytically active metals during preparation of the support composition.Another method is to impregnate the support composition with one or more catalytically active metals, in a subsequent step. The catalysts of the present invention may be suitable for such uses as Fisher Tropsch processes, hydrodesulfurization, and various hydrogenation processes. Of particular interest herein are catalysts suitable for the hydrogenation of organic compounds, preferably olefinic and aromatic compounds. Other hydrogenation reactions for which the catalysts of the present invention may be employed is the hydrogenation of mesityl oxide to MIBK and aldehydes to alcohols. In the drawings Figure 1 is a plot of conversion of benzene to cyclohexane versus time on stream for ComparativeCatalysts A, B, C, D, and Catalyst E of the present invention. Figure 2 is a plot of conversion of benzene to cyclohexane versus time on stream for ComparativeCatalysts F and Catalyst G of the present invention. Figure 3 is a plot of conversion of benzene to cyclohexane versus time on stream for ComparativeCatalysts H, I, J, K, and Catalysts L and M of the present invention. Figure 4 is a plot of conversion of benzene to cyclohexane versus time on stream for ComparativeCatalysts N, and Catalysts 0 and P of the present invention. The coprecipitated support compositions and catalysts of the present invention can be prepared by various techniques. For example, all the components of the reaction mixture e.g., the metal salts and solid porous carrier particles may be placed in a suitable reaction vessel under acidic conditions and thereafter the hydroxyl ion concentration may be increased while heating and agitating the slurry. In connection with this technique, reference is made to U.S. Patent No. 4,113,658. Another technique involves dissolving the metal and aluminum salts e.g., nickel nitrate and aluminum nitrate in water with agitation and at elevated temperatures, preferably temperatures ranging from about 600C to the solution s boiling point at atmospheric pressure. Higher temperatures may be employed provided the solution is under pressure. The heated metal salt solution is then gradually added to the solid porous particles slurried in an aqueous solution containing silicate salt e.g. sodium metasilicate . Generally, the dissolved metal ions in the reaction mixture will be kept below about 0.6 mols liter. This dilution of the dissolved metal ions is one preferred means for obtaining high metal surface area in the catalyst.Preferably, a precipitating agent is added to the heated reaction mixture to aid in the coprecipitation of the metal with the aluminum and silicate ions and porous support particles. During catalyst preparation, additional water may be added to the reaction mixture to maintain a nearly constant volume so that water loss by evaporation is continually replaced. The aqueous reaction mixture is preferably kept at elevated temperatures, e.g., from about 600C to about the boiling point of the solution at atmospheric pressure for a period of one to five hours. Heating at a temperature below the boiling point of the solution, i.e., 60 990C, may be employed to minimize evaporation. The reaction mixture is then filtered and the resulting product is washed, preferably several times with boiling water, to remove alkali metals ions and other impurities. The product will generally be washed four or more times.The catalyst is then dried at temperatures ranging from about 90 2000C for about one to five hours and calcined in an oxygencontaining gas such as air, to a temperature ranging from about 300 4500C, for a period of about 2 8 hours, preferably about 3 5 hours. The finished catalyst can then be reduced or charged directly or subsequent to shaping or extruding, such as in the form of tablets or pellets into a reaction vessel, without activation, and activated in a reaction vessel with a gaseous reductant, usually flowing hydrogen. Alternatively, the catalyst may be prereduced and passivated stabilized prior to charging into a reactor. As previously stated, it is preferred that the catalysts of the present invention be prepared so that coprecipitation is made from dilute solutions. For example, the concentration of catalytically active metal should be no greater than about 1 mol liter and the concentration of the combination of aluminum salt t and silicate should be no greater than about 0.4 mols liter.The more preferred solution used in preparing the catalysts of the present invention will have a no more than about 0.75 mols liter of ions of catalytically active metal, most preferably less than about 0.6 mols liter, and b about 0.26 mols liter of aluminum and silicate ions. Such dilute solutions provide high metal surface area. The term catalytically active metal as used herein means a metal capable of catalytically transforming, or converting, an organic compound under reaction conditions. Non limiting examples of catalytically active metals which may be employed in the catalysts of the present invention include those metals selected from the following groups of the Periodic Table of theElements Group VIII Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt Group IB Cu, Ag, and Au Group IIB Zn, Cd, and Hg and Group IIA Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, and Ra .The Periodic Table of the Elements referred to herein is that table which appears on the inside cover of the 55th Edition 1974 1975 of the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, published by CRC Press. Non limiting examples of sources of aluminum ions suitable for use herein are the water soluble salts of aluminum which includes aluminum nitrate, aluminum sulfate, and aluminum chloride. Preferred is aluminum nitrate. Non limiting examples of sources of silicate ions suitable for use herein are the water soluble silicates. These generally include the alkali metal silicates such as the sodium and potassium silicates, preferably sodium metasilicate. Also suitable is a source of silicic acid ions. Non limiting examples of solid porous particles suitable for use herein include alumina, kieselguhr, infusorial earth, diatomaceous earth, siliceous earth, and silica. Preferred is alumina or kieselguhr particles, more preferred is eta and gamma alumina particles, and most preferred is gamma alumina particles. When nickel and cobalt are employed in the hydrogenation catalysts of the present invention, the weight ratio of nickel to cobalt in the catalyst should range from about 63 to about 0.3, or from about 0.067 to about 0.017. If a Group IB metal such as copper is employed with nickel and or cobalt in a hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention, the catalysts should include from about 1 wt. to about 10 wt. copper, based on the total weight of the calcined and reduced catalyst. Up to 10 wt. , based on the total weight of the calcined and reduced catalyst, of one or more of aGroup IIA metal, preferably magnesium or barium, more preferably magnesium, may also be employed. Preferably such a catalyst would be based on nickel, cobalt, or a mixture of nickel and cobalt, and contain about 0.05 wt. to 10 wt. , more preferably about 0.1 to 8 wt. , and most preferably about 0.5 to 6 wt. of one or moreGroup IIA metals. Most preferably such a catalyst will be a nickel base catalyst and the Group IIA metal will be magnesium. The total amount of Group VIII metal in a catalyst of the present invention when the metal is Fe,Co and or Ni, will generally range from about 10 to about 70 wt. , based on the total weight of the calcined and reduced catalyst. Preferably about 25 to 60 wt. ofGroup VIII metal is present, more preferably about 40 to 55 wt. of Group VIII metal is present. For catalysts of the present invention based on the platinum GroupVIII metals such as platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium, it is preferred, primarily for economic reasons, that the catalyst contain only from about 0.1 to 10 wt. , preferably 0.15 to 3 wt. more preferably 0.2 to 2 wt. of such metals. The iron, cobalt, and nickel base catalysts of the present invention are preferably prepared by the coprecipitation procedure described herein. Catalysts which are based on catalytically active metals other than iron, cobalt and nickel are preferably prepared by the impregnation procedure described herein. The weight ratios of A1203 to SiO2 in the calcined catalyst composition derived from the aluminum and silicate slats ranges from about 0.3 1 to 1 0.3, preferably from about 0.4 1 to 1 0.4, and more preferably from about 0.45 1 to 1 0.45. Ideal catalysts of the present invention have been made wherein the ratio is 1 1. Blends outside these ranges have not been shown to provide the benefits of improved catalytic activity and stability as demonstrated by those catalysts of the present invention which are within the above mentioned ranges. In the preparation of either the catalyst support composition alone, or the resulting catalyst composition containing one or more catalytically active metals, about 10 to 70 wt. of the total alumina and or silica is derived from the solid porous particles the remainder is derived from precipitated aluminum and silicate ions. Preferably about 30 to 50 wt. of the total alumina and or silica content is derived from the solid porous particles. It is also within the scope of the present invention to employ one or more catalytically active metals with the novel catalyst support composition claimed herein. As previously discussed, these catalytically active metals may be either coprecipitated with the aluminum and silicate ions onto the solid porous particles during preparation of the support composition or they may be impregnated in a subsequent step onto the catalyst support composition by contacting the support composition with an aqueous solution containing ions of one or more catalytically active metals. In the case of hydrogenation catalysts, it is preferred to coprecipitate the catalytically active metal with the aluminum and silicate ions onto the solid porous particles. As set forth in the Examples to follow, hydrogenation catalysts prepared by use of the novel catalyst support composition of the present invention exhibit relatively low deactivation at elevated temperatures. The consequence of this is that because of the relatively high activity and good heat stability of the catalysts of the present invention, higher throughputs or less total catalyst load to the reacctor way be employed to achieve a particular level of activity when compared with hydrogenation catalysts heretofore known. It is preferred, especially when one or more catalytically active metals are employed, that the coprecipitation of metal ions with aluminum and silicate ions and solid porous particles be completed by the addition of a water soluble alkaline precipitating agent. Alkaline ammonium precipitating agents such as ammonium bicarbonate and ammonia are most suitable for minimizing the amount of alkali metal residue which is removed by washing to avoid poisoning action on the finished catalyst. Although in some instances, alkali precipitating agents may be used where an alkali such as potassium acts as a promoter, rather than a poison.Sodium carbonate is another example of a suitable water soluble alkali precipitating agent. Various organic alkaline materials such as urea, and primary and secondary amines, may be used to complete the precipitation. However, preferred precipitating agents include ammonium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate. The precipitated support composition, or catalyst, is preferably washed to remove impurities, particularly sodium. If it is desired to remove trace levels of sodium in the catalyst, one may wash the filter cake with a washing liquor comprised of a mixture of water and a small amount, i.e., about 100 ppm of nitrate, or 200 ppm of ammonium carbonate. In this connection, reference is made to U.S. Patent No. 4,105,59L. After washing, drying, and calcining, the catalyst can be reduced to activate it. Reduction is carried out in the presence of a reducing gas, preferably hydrogen. The reducing gas is passed over the catalyst at ambient temperature at a rate from about 5 liters hr gm to about 30 liters hr gm where upon the temperature is raised to a range of from about 750C to about 4500C, preferably from about 1950C to about 4000C. The copper containing catalysts of the present invention may be reduced at temperatures ranging from about 1500C to about 2500C, preferably from about 1750C to about 2250C. The reduction activation may be carried out prior to use and it may be passivated for shipping purposes or activated after the catalyst has been loaded into the reaction vessel where a reaction such as hydrogenation will be carried out. The reaction vessel may be either batch or continuous. The nature of the reactor will be obvious to one skilled in the art.The activation procedure of U.S. Patent No. 4,088,603, may be used to activate the catalyst of the present invention. The activated catalyst is sensitive to deactivation and may not be stored in the presence of oxygen at ordinary temperatures without first being passivated.The pasivation step may consist of purging the reactor at a temperature greater than about 1500C with an inert gas, preferably nitrogen, cooling to ambient temperature, then passing the inert gas over the catalyst while an air bleed is introduced into the inert gas so as to have approximately 1 2 mol percent oxygen present. This procedure will passivate the catalyst by putting a surface oxide coating on it. Preferably, the catalyst will be passivated by the process of U.S. Patent No.4,090,980. The B.E.T. total surface area of the catalyst of the present invention will generally range from about 150 to about 350 m2 g, preferably from about 225 m2 g to about 325 m2 g. The method for measuring the total catalyst surface area known as the B.E.T. method is described in Emmett, P.H., Advances in Catalysis, I. 65, 1948 . Furthermore, the catalyst preferably contains about 0.1 wt. or less sodium based on the total weight of the catalyst. Where nickel is chosen as the catalytically active metal herein, the resulting catalyst is capable of having a nickel surface area ranging from about 55 to 100 m2 g as determined by hydrogen chemisorption after reduction at 4000C, unless otherwise specified, in the manner described by Yates, Taylor and Sinfelt in J. AmChem. Soc., 86, 2996 1964 Furthermore, the catalyst preferably contains about 0.1 wt. or less of sodium and preferably from about 25 wt. to about 50 wt. of nickel based on the total weight of the catalyst. Where cobalt is chosen as the metal herein, the resulting catalyst is capable of having a cobalt surface area ranging from about 5 to about 20 m2 g as determined by hydrogen chemisorption discussed above after reduction at 4000C unless otherwise specified.Furthermore, the catalyst preferably contains about 0.1 wt. or less sodium and preferably from about 25 wt. to about 60 wt. of cobalt wherein all weight percents are based on the total weight of the catalyst. The preferred catalysts of the present invention are particularly useful for hydrogenating hydrogenatable organic compounds. In this connection, the catalysts of the present invention may be used to hydrogenate aromatic containing compounds as typified by the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of both saturated and unsaturated aldehydes, to alcohols, as in the well known oxo process the hydrogenation of double bonds in edible fats and oils, as well as other olefins both straight and branched chain the hydrogenation of aromatics in white oil base stock to produce high grade white oil the hydrogenation of nitro compounds to amines and the hydrogenation of nitriles to amines. The term, olefins, as used herein, means those unsaturated compounds having at least one multiple bond which includes polyunsaturated compounds as well. The conditions for the hydrogenation reactions have been discussed very widely and are well known to those skilled in the art. Broadly, the following conditions may be utilized temperatures ranging from about 250C to about 3000C, preferably from about 750C to about 250oC pressures ranging from about 1 atmosphere to about 800 atmospheres, preferably from about 1 atmosphere to about 50 atmospheres feed rates from about 0.2 to about 100 volumes per hour per volume of catalyst, and hydrogen addition from about 500 to about 10,000 standard cubic feet per barrel SCF B of feed. In the case of the oxo process, i.e., the addition of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to alkene to produce alcohols, aldehydes and other oxygenated organic compounds, one would typically employ conditions such that the temperatures would range from about 700C to about 1750C and use a hydrocarbon mole ratio of about 0.5 to about 10 and a pressure of about 100 to about 1000 psig. The alkenes used in such a process would typically contain from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms per molecule. The product of such a carbonylation process generally consists, of aldehydes, acetals, unsaturated oxygenated materials and the like, which require hydrofinishing in a second or further hydrogenation stage. It is to the treatment of the aldehyde product, in particular, that the present invention applies. Hydrogenation conditions in this further reaction stage follow those generally employed in the first stage. Another useful improved hydrogenation is the conversion of aromatics in white oils to yield high quality solvents. Upgrading of white spirits by the process of the present invention is an improvement in the treatment of such materials. Still another useful improved hydrogenation of the present invention is the conversion of olefins in paraffin solvents such as denonenizer bottoms and deoctenizer overheads. Two especially useful hydrogenation processes included within the scope of the invention include the hydrogenation of aromatics such as benzene to cyclohexane and the production of amines from nitro compounds and nitriles. For example, the present invention is useful in converting C12 to C24 nitriles to the corresponding fatty acid amines. Also, aromatic nitro compounds may be converted to amines, e.g., nitrobenzene to aniline or the conversion of aromatic amines to cycloaliphatic amines, e.g., aniline to cyclohexane amine. The following Examples more fully describe the manner of making and using the abovedescribed invention, as well as set forth the best modes contemplated for carrying out various aspects of the invention. It is understood that these Examples in no way limit the true scope of this invention, but rather, are presented for illustrative purposes.Comparative Example In 460 ml of distilled water there was added 62.9 g Ni N03 2.6H20 and 2.8 g of kieselguhr particles.In another 100 ml of distilled water there was dissolved 21.25 g Na2SiO3.9H20.

These results are surprising since the presence of A1203 alone in the Ni Cu catalyst systems has less activity than the Ni Cu Si02 catalysts that have been reduced at 2000C.The results of Table II are also shown in Fig. 2 for the sake of clarity.Comparative Examples Catalysts H and I were prepared in the following manner To 560 ml of distilled water there was added, with agitation, 56.7 g Ni NO3 2.6H20, 5.3 g ofCo NO3 2.6H20, 33.1 g A1 NO3 3.9H2O 4.0 g Cu N03 2,6H2O, and 2.8 g of solid porous particles of kieselguhr. The resulting agitated mixture was heated to above 800C but below the boiling point of the solution and 69.9 g of NH4HCO3 was added as fast as foaming would allow.The agitated reaction mixture was maintained at above 800C for 3 hours. The coprecipitated composition was filtered and washed by reslurrying 3 times with 2 liters of hot 800C distilled water. The resulting filter cake was dried overnight at 1100C and calcined for 3 hours at 4000C. A portion of the catalyst, Catalyst H , was reduced in hydrogen overnight at 2000C and another portion, Catalyst I , was reduced in hydrogen overnight at 4000C.Comparative Examples Catalysts J and K were prepared as follows In 2.3 liters of distilled water there was dissolved 267 g Ni NO3 2.6H20, 32.3 g Co NO3 2.6H2O and 19.0 g Cu N03 2.3H2O, and 14.0 g solid porous particles of kieselguhr particles. A second solution was prepared by dissolving 106.25 g of Na2Si04.9H20 in 500 ml of distilled water. This sec ond solution was added dropwise into the first solution as it was being rapidly stirred. The resulting mixture was heated to above 800C and 212.1 g of NH4HCO3 was added the mixture was thoroughly mixed for another 30 minutes. The coprecipitated catalyst composition was then filtered and the filter cake was washed several times by reslurrying with one liter of hot distilled water.The filter cake was dried overnight at 110 C and calcined for 2 hours at 4000C.A portion of the catalyst, Catalyst J , was reduced in hydrogen overnight at 2000C and another portion,Catalyst K , was reduced in hydrogen overnight at 4000C. Both catalysts I and J , in unreduced form, had a B.E.T. surface area of 246 m2 g.Examples 3 and 4 Catalysts L and M were prepared as follows To 460 ml of distilled water there was added 53.4 g Ni N03 2.6H20, 6.5 g Co N03 2.6H20, 3.8 g Cu NO3 2.3H2O, 16.6 g A1 N03 3.9H20, and 2.8 g of solid porous particles of kieselguhr particles. A second solution was prepared by dissolving 10.6 g of Na2SiO3.9H2O in 100 ml of distilled water. This second solution was added dropwise to the first solution as it was being rapidly stirred. The resulting mixture was heated above 800C and 55 g of NH4HCO3 was added the mixture was thoroughly mixed for another 30 minutes. The coprecipitated catalyst composition was then filtered and the filter cake was washed several times by reslurrying with one liter of hot distilled water. The filter cake was dried overnight at 1100C and calcined for 2 hours at 4000C.A portion of the catalyst, Catalyst L , was reduced in hydrogen overnight at 2000C and another portion,Catalyst M was reduced in hydrogen overnight at 400oC. Both Catalysts L and M in unreduced form had aB.E.T. surface area of 196 m2 g. Each of Catalysts H, I, J, K, L and M were tested for their ability to hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane. The results are shown in Table III below.

The data in Table III show that the catalyst of the present invention is comparable to the Ni Co Cu SiO2 kieselguhr catalyst described in U.S. Patent No.4,263,225 when reduced at 2000C, except that the catalyst of the present invention Catalyst M has a higher activity than Catalyst K when reduced at 4000C.Thus, the catalyst of the present invention appears to have a better heat stability. These results are particularly surprising in view of the relatively poor activity shown for the Ni Co Cu Al203 kieselguhr Catalysts H and I . For the sake of clarity, these data are graphically shown in Fig. 3.Comparative Example To 186 ml of distilled water there was added 74.1 g Ni NO3 2.6H2O, 21.3 g Al N03 3.9H2O, 1.9 9 g Mg NO3 2.6H2O, and 1.8 g of solid porous particles of gamma alumina. 60 g of Na2CO3 was dissolved in 200 ml of distilled water this second solution was slowly added to the first solution with rapid agitation.The mixture was heated above 900C but below the boiling point of the solution and maintained at that temperature for 30 minutes. The resulting coprecipitated catalyst was filtered and washed until the pH of the filtrate had fallen below 8. The filtrate was dried at 1100C and calcined for 6 hours at 4500C. A portion of the catalyst was reduced in hydrogen overnight at 4000C. The unreduced portion of the catalyst had a B.E.T. surface area of 173 m2 g.Example 5 Catalyst 0 was prepared as follows To 400 ml of distilled water there was added 62.9 g Ni N03 2.6H20, 15.6 Al N03 3.9H2O, 1.7 g Mg N03 2.6H20, and 2.8 g solid porous particles of kieselguhr. A second solution was prepared by dissaluing 10.0 g Na2SiO3.9H20 in 200 ml of distilled water.This second solution was added dropwise into the first solution with rapid stirring. The resulting mixture was heated to above 800C and 35.0 g of Na2C03 was added the mixture was thoroughly mixed for another 30 minutes. The coprecipitated catalyst composition was then filtered and the filter cake was washed several times by reslurrying in one liter of hot distilled water. The filter cake was dried overnight at 1100C and calcined for 2 hours at 400oC. A portion of the catalyst was reduced in hydrogen overnight at 4000C.Example 6 Catalyst P was prepared in the same manner as for Catalyst N except that 2.8 g of solid porous particles of gamma alumina seed were used in place of the 2.8 g of kieselguhr. Each of Catalysts N, 0 and P were tested for their ability to hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane.The results are shown in Table IV below.

The data of Table IV are shown in Fig. 4 for the purpose of clarity. It is also contemplated herein that the SiO2 derived from the silicate salt can be replaced in whole or in part by metal oxides such as TiO2 derived from titanium salts. In such cases, the weight ratio of A1203 to TiO2 would be same as previously specified herein for the A1203 5.02 blends. It is postulated that the coprecipitated and calcined A1203 would also have a stabilizing effect on the TiO2 which has a normal tendency to be unstable at elevated temperatures. Such Al 203 Ti 02 systems could provide the support for such catalytic metals as ruthenium, rhodium palladium, platinum, iridium, osmium in addition to iron, cobalt and nickel.
