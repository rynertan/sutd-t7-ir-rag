# Liquid level sensing circuitry.

## Abstract
A liquid level sensing circuitry useable for detecting the presence of an acceptable or unacceptable level for a liquid, such as engine oil. Prior to termination of the operation of the engine, the circuitry presents an unacceptable level indication at a control point 44. After completion of a time delay following termination of engine operation, an accept able level must be presented for a time to cause an acceptable level indication at the control point 44 which is maintained pending initiation of engine operation. Upon initiation of engine operation a first discernible indication 36 is provided for a time period if the control point presents an unacceptable level indication with a second discernible indication 42 provided for such time period if the control point 44 presents an acceptable level indication.
