## Description
Holder for Plastic Pipes being Tested for Internal 0Pressure at Temperatures up to 200 C This invention relates to a holfer for plastic pipes used mainly in testing these pipes for internal pressure strength at temperatures up to 200 C in adequate devices adopted for this purpose. This holder makes it possible to fasten correctly the pipe segment designed for testing, to fill the pipe with a medium heated to 0 temperature up to 200 C and to generate within the pipe a pressure of the medium corresponding to the required stress in its wall.The holder for the plastic pipes to be tested has to fulfil the following requirements a complete tightness of the pipe during the test must be provided, the pipe should be clutched in a way preventing the holder from sliding down during the test unter the influence of big axial forces being derived from the pressure of the medium within the pipe, fastening of the holder should not cause any stress concentration in the pipe in the neighbourhood of the holder, during the longtime test at elevated temperatures the non metallic materials used for gaskets should not prematurely decay or be destroyed, the holder must make it possible to fill the pipe with the medium and to vent it simultaneously as well to generate the requiredX pressure durifig the test, an easy assembly of the holder on the pipe as well as its disassembly after the end of the test should be possible.There are various known kinds of holders being used for testing plastic pipes, meeting the abovementioned requirements in a lesser or a major degree. However the majority of constructional solutions does not meet all the named requirements simultaneously and on account of the kind of the gaskets used and of the way of protecting the holders against sliding down from the pipe, they are not designed for working at temperatures above 1 oo C. ioo C.Another inconvenience of the most holders being used at present consists in the necessity to plastify preliminarily the end of the pipe by preheating it before putting the holder on it. This causes the formation of additional stresses in the pipe, the operation being very difficult and if the pipes to be tested have big diameters the operation is even impossible without application of special devices for preheating the pipeends.Further there are known holders adapted for fastening on the pipe without its preheating. For example there is known a holder of this kind designed for fastening samples of plastic pipes in an strength testing device, developed by the Institut fr Prüftechnik, FederalRepublic of Germany symbol RP 904. This holder is most similar to the subject matter of this invention, notwithstanding that essential differences are between the both holders. The known holder comprises two rigid, practically indeformable clamping rings with grooves provided inside and a packing ring with its mounting. The pipe to be tested is clamped between the clamping rings by means of screws and the holder is thus jammed on the pipe. Such clamping of the pipe causes the distortion of its original shape i.e.the pipelooses its circular section,In consequence in the wall of the pipe may occur additional stresses caused by an uneven distribution of the radial clamping forces on the circumference which may contribute to the cracking of the pipe in the proximity of the holder. This is an absolutely undesired phenomenon.A further inconvenience of the abovementioned holder consists in the fact that there is no possibility to provide in this holder a constant relation between the quantity of the clamping forcec and the pressure of the medium whithin the pipe. This is a disadvantagegous phenomenon, because clamping of the holder without maintaining proper relations between the abovementioned forces causes either sliding down of the holder from the pipe, as the clamping force are to weak, or formation of a needless surplus of this force and in consequence an increase of undesired additional stresses.This kind of holders for testing plastic pipes, although they may be used for various purposes, are designed mainly for fastening pipes being tested for their internal pressure strength and in this connec calv tion can be used in principleyin devices serving for this kind of tests. In such testing one set of holders comprising a top holder and a bottom holder is necessary for one pipe. According to the construction of the device for testing pipe strength the bottom holder may have a valve for venting the pipe and the top holder mÅay be provided ith ä medium üppty conduit.There exists also another solution in which the bottom holder constitutes the closure of the pipe end without any hole and the top holder is equipped with a venting conduit and a medium supply conduit.The disadvantages of the former holders for testing plastic pipes are eliminated unexpectedly by the holder according to this invention providing an improved construction of the system sealing and blocking the holder on the pipe, which allows an uniform distribution of the clamping forces on the circumference of the pipe, the quantitiy of these forces being connected with and depending on the pressure existing within the pipe being tested. The holder according to his invention not only meets at the same time all the requirements set on it, but also due to the choice of an adequate gasket permits to provide testing tempera 0 tures up to 200 C.The holder according to this inven tion constitutes a set composed of two holders the top holder and the bottom holder which are put on the opposite ends of the pipes to be tested, each single holder comprises two separate basic parts an immovable cover and an immovable clamping ring connected together when put on the end of the pipe by means of fasteners, advantageously screws, the cover of the holder is to be connected with the hydraulic system comprises a tapped hole, in which an attachment enabling to vent the pipe. and to fill it with the medium, is fastened. Each cover has on the inside a conical surface on which is placed a specially shaped disk spring, this cover being separably connected with the clamping ring via a metal ring and an elastic packing ring.Each clamping ring has in its upper inner part a cylindrical surface constituting a guide for the cover operating with the clamping ring, whereas the lower inner part of the clamping ring shows a conical surface, on which two elastic halfrings being moved. The outer surface of the half rings constitutes a cone corresponding to the cone of the clamping ring, whereas the inner surface forms a cylinder with a screw line with sharp edges.The diameter of the cylindrical surface of the halfrings is adjusted to the outer diameter of the pipe being tested. The shape and size of all parts of the holder for example the covers, the clamping rings, the half rings and the connecting elements depend on the diameter of the pipe to be tested. The abovemen tioned elements are made from stainless steel,whereas the elastic packing ring is made from a material resistant to the action of temperature raising up to 0 200 C, advantageously ethylene propylene rubber. The holder according to this invention is hereafter explained in more detail, referring to a practical example shown in the drawings.Fig. 1 represents the entire holder together with the pipe prepared to work andFig. 2 represents the top holder with the attachment to the hydraulic system.This holder comprises a cover 1 to which is screwed a attachment 4. This attachment has two parts.One of them connected with the hydraulic system of the testing device is provided for venting the pipe sample and the other is designed for filling it with a medium and for maintaining pressure within it. The attachment 4 is sealed with the cover 1 by the gasket 10.The cover 1 has in its inner part a conical surface on which is placed a disk spring 7. Due to the provision of a conical surface the disk spring 7 can be deformed within the limit of elasticity. The cover 1 is connected with the clamping ring 2 in such a way that the outer cylindrical bottom surface of the cover operates with the inner cylindrical top surface of the clamping ring ensuring the coaxiality of the movement of these parts. The inner bottom part of the clamping ring 2 has the shape of a cone in which are placed two elastic half rings 3. These rings 3 comprise on their inner cylindrical surface, the diameter of which being equal to the diameter of the pipe 6 to be tested, a screw line with sharp edges. On the top surface of the elastic half rings is located a packing ring 5, and the elastic gasket 8 placed at the same time in a special neck of the cover 1.The cover 1 is connected with the clamping ring by means of screws 9.The holder according to the invention acts in the following way both holders, i.e. the top holder and the bottom holder, are to be put on the opposite ends of the pipe to be tested as shown on fig. 2, with loosened screws 9. By turning the screws 9 the holder is blocked and sealed on the pipe. When the screws are turned the cover 1 is moved in relation to the clamping ring 2. This generates an axial force which presses down the elastic half rings 3 to the outer wall of the pipe 6. The half rings 3 are jammed even by a slight axial force on account of the sharp edges of the screw line provided on their cylindrical parts. By further turning the screws, after the half rings have been jammed, the elastic gasket 8 being compressed, the disk spring 7 being at the same time deformed.Simultaneously the phenomenon of further indentation of the half rings into the walls of the pipe 6 occurs.In result the force with which the gasket 8 is compressed and at the same time, due to the fact that it is located in a special neck of the cover 1 and is pressed to the outer wall of the pipe does not depend on the forces generated by turning the screws but only on the elasticity of the disk spring 7.This is very essential as there exists no need to apply big forces for connecting the cover 1 of the holder with the clamping ring 2 thus rendering it possible to eliminate the risk of generating additional stresses in the walls of the pipe and to protect the gasket 8 against destruction. In consequence of the above the holder is fastened on the pipe in an elastic way. The use of mobile elastic half rings 3 and of the disk spring 7 in the holder according to this invention leads to a certain automation of the blocking process, as the system tpipe holder becomes a system readjusting itself to the pressure of the medium in the pipe and, what is most important, between the clamping forces and the pressure a constant dependence is being established.The holder according to the invention, in addition to a more convenient handling as compared with known holders, provides also a coaxiality of the holder and the pipe. This is important in the case when the pipe has technological errors of shape. The trend towards coaxiality may then eliminate the generating of undesired bending moments. It has to be added that in the holder according to this invention the pipe is sealed on its outer wall.This is very important as the outer diameters of pipes are standardized and the thickness of their walls being different. In this way the holder makes it possible to test all pipes of a given diameter without respect to the thickness of their walls.The holder according to this invention does not require any special preparation of the pipe for its fastening in contrast to the abovementioned holder produced in the Federal Republic of Germany which makes it necessary to execute on the ends of the pipe a bevel with strictly determined dimensions.This is very important as machining the ends of the pipe causes serious difficulties, particularly at major diameters.
