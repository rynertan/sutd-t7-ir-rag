# Apparatus for operating a movable component of a vehicle.

## Abstract
Apparatus for operating a movable component, such as a pivotable skip, of a vehicle comprises a pivotable lever 15 for operating a valve 20 for supplying working fluid through a conduit 11 to effect movement of the component. The lever 15 is restrained from being moved from an inopera tive position by a detent 16 until switches 18,20,21 and 24 in a circuit, which also includes a solenoid 17 , are closed causing energisation of the solenoid. Energisation of the solenoid 17 effects removal of the detent 16 from the path of the lever 15 permitting movement of the lever.

## Description
DESCRIPTION This invention relates to apparatus for operating a movable component of a vehicle. It is known to provide motor vehicle tip trucks each provided with a skip for containing a load. The skip of such a vehicle is pivotable about a transverse axis at the rear of the vehicle so that the skip can be pivoted in a rearward direction of the vehicle on the axis with a result that a load contained in the skip slides downwardly and rearwardly thereof and is deposited on ground to the rear of the vehicle. The pivoting, or tipping operation of the skip generally is affected by means of a fluid pressure system which is controlled by operation of a lever pivotable about an axis extending through one end portion thereof. The lever generally is located in a driver s cab of the vehicle. A disadvantage of providing such a lever in the cab is that there is a tendancy for a driver to operate the lever to effect pivoting of a skip while the vehicle is in motion. A further disadvantage is that the skip may be operated to deposit a load when the longitudinal and transverse axes of the vehicle are not in a substantially horizontal plane. In consequence, when a laiden skip is operated to deposit the load, the centre of gravity of the vehicle may shift to a position causing instability of the vehicle. According to the present invention, there is provided apparatus for operating a movable component of a vehicle comprising operating means for controlling movement of the component, the operating means being movable in a path from an inoperative position to an operative position, a detent adapted to be moved into said path to restrain movement of the operating means in said path from said inoperative position, and actuating means for withdrawing the detent from said path, the actuating means being operable in response to operation of a control member for controlling the vehicle whereby the actuating means is controlled to withdraw the detent from said path when the control member is operated. The operating means may comprise a lever pivotable at one end portion thereof so as to move in the said path. The lever may be adapted to control operation of a valve when moved in the said path, the valve controlling supply of fluid in a fluid control system for moving the component. The actuating means may be controlled by an electrical circuit which may include a plurality of switches. One of said switches may be operated in response to movement of a gear selector lever of the vehicle. Another of said switches may be operated in response to operation of a brake pedal of the vehicle. Another of said switches may be operated in response to operation of an additional pedal of a vehicle. Another of said switches may be operable when longitudinal and transverse axes of the vehicle are in a substantially horizontal plane. The switch operable in response to operation of the brake pedal comprises a pressure switch operable in accordance with pressure of fluid in a brake system, the pressure being controlled by operation of the brake pedal. The actuating means may comprise a solenoid operated actuating member. Following is a description, by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings,of one method of carrying the invention into effect. In the drawings FIGURE i is a diagrammatic representation of one embodiment of apparatus according to the present invention shown in an inoperative condition, and FIGURE 2 is a diagrammatic representation of the apparatus shown in an operative condition. Referring now to the drawings, there is shown apparatus 10 for operating a skip not shown of a vehicle not shown . The skip is operated by fluid pressure directed through a conduit ii in the direction of the arrows A. The conduit ii contains a valve 12 comprising a rotatable disc member 13 provided with a passageway 14 extending diametrically therethrough.The rotatable member 13 has connected thereto one end of a lever 15, the lever being pivotable about a central longitudinal axis of the rotatable member 13 to pivot the rotatable member from an inoperative position in which the central longitudinal axis of the passageway 14 is at an angle to the central longitudinal axis of the conduit ii, as shown in Figure i, to an operative position in which the central longitudinal axes of the passageway 14 and the conduit 11 are in line, as shown in Figure 2. In order to move the rotatable member 13 from the inoperative position to the operative position and subsequently from the operative position to the inoperative position, the lever 13 is moved through an arcuate path. The apparatus includes a detent 16 which is resiliently biased into the arcuate path to restrain movement of the lever 15 from the inoperative position. The detent 16 is moved against the resilent bias by the armature of a solenoid 17 when energised. The solenoid nisiricluded in an electrical circuit which also includes a spring loaded switch 18 operable by a gear lever 19 of the vehicle, when the gear lever is in a neutral position, a tilt sensor 20 operable when longitudinal and transverse axes of the vehicle are in a substantially horizontal plane, a pressure switch 21 in communication with a conduit 22 of a pneumatic braking system of the vehicle, the braking system including a pedal 23 and the conduit 22 being located downstream of the pedal 23 such that the pressure switch 21 is closed due to pressure of air in the conduit 22 when the pedal 25 is operated, and a spring loaded switch 24 operable by a pedal 25. The lever 25 is normally in the inoperative position and is prevented from being moved through the arcuate path to the operative position to effect operation of the skip due to the detent 16 extending into the path.However, when the gear lever 19 is moved to the neutral position, the brake pedal 23 is operated and the pedal 25 also is operated and assuming that the longitudinal and transverse axes of the vehicle are contained in a substantially horizontal plane, each of the switches 18, 20, 21 and 24 is closed thereby completing an electrical circuit through the solenoid 17 causing energisation of the solenoid and withdrawal of the detent 16 from the path of the lever 15. The lever 15 thereby is permitted to be pivoted on the central longitudinal axis of the rotatable member 13 from the inoperative position to the operative position and,when so moved, the rotatable member 13 is rotated to a position in which the central longitudinal axis of the passageway 14 and the conduit 11 are in line permitting fluid to be supplied through the valve 12 to effect operation of the skip.
