# Link chain.

## Abstract
A chain, particularly for a track laying vehicle, has a pair of link chains which are maintained in spaced parallel rela tionship by shoes secured to the respective links of the link chains. The shoes have central lugs 18 for engagement by a drive sprocket. Each link chain is formed from a series of links 16 . Each link 16 has at one end, a socket 23 and, at the other end, a pin 24 which is received in the socket of an adjacent link. The pin defines a reservoir 27 for containing lubricant for lubricating the pivot joint defined by the pin and socket. A crescent seal 36 defines a moving seal for coopera tion with a fixed seal 30, 31 between an end cap 29 and the socket end 21 of the link for preventing leakage of the lubric ant.
