## Description
The present invention relates to an improved pipe coupling. Pipe couplings for coupling two sections of pipe together, or for coupling the end of a pipe to a fitting such as a tap or a machine such as a pump or the like are known in various forms. Typically such couplings comprise two major coupling parts, a first part which comprises a spigot which is in use engaged into the end of a section of pipe to be coupled and a second part which is connectable to a fitting or which comprises a similar spigot so that it can be fitted to a second section of pipe. In use the pipe or pipe and fitting are coupled by connecting the coupling parts together. It is known from FR A 2257056 to provide a pipe coupling of the type comprising a first coupling part connectable to a pipe or fitting and including a body portion and a second coupling part connectable to a pipe or fitting and comprising a hollow interior adapted to receive the body portion of the first coupling part in sealing engagement, the body portion of the said first coupling part including an annular recess and the said second coupling part including a transverse slot formed therein across said hollow interior and a release bar slidably mounted in the said transverse slot and comprising an aperture therethrough of a diameter similar to the diameter of the said first coupling part body portion, said release bar being movable between a first position wherein said aperture is substantially aligned with said hollow interior such that said body portion can be entered into or removed from the said hollow interior and a second position wherein the said aperture of the release bar is offset from the said hollow interior such that an operative portion of the periphery of said aperture engages the said annular recess of the said first coupling part when same is received in said hollow interior to retain same therein, said release bar being resiliently urged towards said second position and manually movable thereform to said first position, and movable from said second position to said first position against said resilient urging by engagement of the nose of the first coupling part body portion against the operative portion of the release bar as same is entered into said hollow interior, said operative portion of the said release bar being sloped towards the entry to the said hollow interior and said annual recess in the said first coupling part body portion comprises a first substantially vertical wall adjacent said nose portion and a second sloping wall extending towards the rear of the body portion. In this known pipe coupling, the sealing is of flat annular shape, so its sealing properties get progressively worse as the cooperating sealing parts wear as a result of repeated use. The present invention aims to provide a pipe coupling which overcomes these problems of the prior art and accordingly provides a coupling in which the second coupling part 2 includes a longitudinally extending hollow sealing member 12 extending from the hollow interior of the second coupling part 2 to engage into and seal with the interior of the first coupling part 1 when the coupling parts are connected whereby said operative portion of the release bar 14 is engaged in the annual recess 5a of said first coupling part 1. Preferably, the first coupling part body portion 4 and said second coupling part hollow interior are substantially cylindrical in shape. In preferred embodiments, the second coupling part 2 is adapted to be connected to a fitting and said sealing member 12 extends through the hollow interior of the second coupling part 2 and comprises on its end opposite the first coupling part a circular sealing ring portion 12a for sealing between the second coupling part 2 and the said fitting. It has been found particularly advantageous if the pipe coupling includes multi stage valving 28,29 in the first coupling part arranged to control the flow of fluid through the coupling and to be caused to open by connection of the second coupling part to the first coupling part, said valving comprising a valve member 28 longitudinally slidably movable in the second coupling part 2 between an open position and a closed position, through an aperture the upper peripheral edge of which forms a major valve seat, said valve member comprising a body portion 28a which is internally hollow and open at one end and which terminates at its other end in an extending stem 28b and said valve member including at least one port communicating the hollow valve interior to the exterior adjacent the base of the said stem, a valve head 29, preferably of an inverted castellated configuration, mounted about the said valve stem 28 such that the valve stem extends through an aperture in said valve head the upper peripheral edge of said aperture 33 forming a minor valve seat and the distal end of the said valve stem being enlarged and adapted to seal against the said minor valve seat when the valve is closed, to prevent the flow of fluid through the said valve head, the said valve head being adapted to engage the said major valve seat and the said enlarged distal valve stem and the said minor valve seal when the valve is closed and the said valve head being shaped and or arranged to direct fluid under pressure when said enlarged stem end is unseated from said minor valve seat during connection of the coupling parts so as to assist in lifting said valve head from said major valve seat. Two preferred couplings of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Reference numerals 1 and 2 in all figures of the drawings indicate the first and second coupling parts of both of the preferred forms of the coupling, which are suitably formed from a plastics material such as polythene, alkathene or nylon, of brass or the like. The first coupling part 1 generally comprises a spigot 3 and a body portion 4, which is preferably generally cylindrical in shape as shown. The body portion 4 comprises an annular recess 5, which is preferably shaped as shown having a first substantially vertical wall 5a adjacent the nose of the body portion 4 and a sloping rear wall 5b extending towards the rear of the body portion. The coupling part 1 may be secured to the end of a pipe by a conventional hose clip or alternatively by way of the arrangement shown, wherein a nut 6 shown in Fig.1 carried on a threaded boss portion 7 is arranged to be screwed to engage with its forward threads the exterior of the end of the pipe engaged on to the spigot 3. The nut 6 has a tapered interior and the spigot 3 can have a generally tapered exterior as shown. The exterior of the nut can be suitably ribbed as indicated at 8, to enable it to be readily gripped in use. The second coupling part 2, is in the forms of coupling shown, at one end adapted to be connected to a fitting such as a tap, and includes a screw threaded portion 9 as shown. It could alternatively comprise a suitable spigot, for example, enabling the second coupling part to be connected to the end of another section of piping. The coupling could comprise as an accessory, a joiner, tail adapted to be screwed into the threaded portion 9 and having a spigot in this regard. At its other end the second coupling part comprises a hollow interior 10 adapted to receive the body portion 4 of the first coupling part when the coupling parts are connected together. In the preferred forms the coupling part 2 is shaped at 11 as shown so as to mount a longitudinally extending sealing member 12 formed of rubber or a like sealing material. The sealing member 12 has a circular sealing ring portion 12a adapted to seal against the end of a tap fitting onto which the second coupling part is fitted, and a portion 12b arranged to extend into and engage with the first coupling part in use see Fig.3 . A transverse slot 13 is formed in the second coupling part across the hollow interior thereof as shown. A release bar 14 which in the preferred form shown is generally square in peripheral shape, is slidably mounted in the transverse slot 13 such that it can slide therein in the direction of arrows A. The sliding movement of the release bar 14 is limited and the release bar is retained in the transverse slot by nibs 15 see Fig.4 formed on either upper edge of the transverse slot, which engage into slight recesses 16 formed at either upper corner of the release bar 14 such that at the full extent of the outward movement of the release bar the nibs 15 will abut the bottom of the recesses 16. The release bar 14 has an aperture 17 therethrough as shown, which is of a diameter similar to the diameter of the body portion 4 of the coupling part 1. The release bar is movable between a first position wherein its aperture 17 is aligned with the hollow interior of the coupling part 2 not shown in the drawings and a second position shown in the drawings and particularly in Fig.4 wherein the aperture 17 is offset from the hollow interior. The release bar is resiliently urged towards the second position, in the preferred forms shown by spring legs 18 formed on the bottom of the release bar as shown. When the release bar is moved from its second position to its first position, by manual pressure applied to its top 14a, the spring legs 18 will flex inwardly towards each other and be collapsed. When manual pressure is removed they will resiliently flex outwardly to urge the release bar back to its second position. In other forms of the invention other arrangements of urging means for the release bar may be provided. In use of both preferred forms of coupling the coupling parts are connected by engaging the coupling part 1 and, specifically, by entering the body portion 4 into the hollow interior 10. When the body portion 4 is fully home within the hollow interior 10 the release bar 14 will be urged towards its normal second position and the arrangement is such that the release bar operative portion 14b engages into the annular recess 5 to retain the coupling part 1 in position and to secure the coupling. The coupling parts can be disconnected and the coupling part 1 removed from the coupling part 2 by pressing the top of the release bar 14a to move the release bar 14 to its first position, and withdrawing the coupling part 1. The release bar is able to be moved from its normal second position to its first position against the urging of the spring legs 18 by the engagement of the nose of the body portion 4 against the operative position 14b of the release bar as the coupling parts are brought together, so that the first coupling part 1 may be snapped into the second coupling part 2. To facilitate this the operative portion 14b of the release bar is sloped towards the entry to the hollow interior 10 as shown. Couplings in accordance with the invention may incorporate a self sealing flow valve arranged to prevent the flow of liquid from one coupling part when the coupling parts are disconnected. The second preferred form coupling of the invention shown in Figs.5 and 6 includes a particularly preferred form of two stage flow valving. The valving is incorporated in the second coupling part 2 which would normally be on the upstream side of the coupling so that when the coupling parts are disconnected the flow of fluid from the upstream pipe or fitting is prevented. When the coupling parts are connected together the valving is operated to enable the flow of fluid through the coupling. In the second preferred form coupling shown the valving comprises a valve member 28 and a valve head 29. The valve member 28 is longitudinally slidably movable within the coupling part 2 between the closed position shown in Fig.5 and the open position shown in Fig.6. The valve member 28 has a valve body portion 28a having a hollow valve interior which is open at one end 28c. The valve member 28 terminates at its other end in an extending valve stem 28b as shown. Ports 30 are provided in the valve member 28 to communicate the hollow interior of the body portion 28a with the exterior, adjacent the base of the stem 28b. The valve member 28 is slidably mounted in the second coupling part 2 between an open and a closed position, through an aperture the upper peripheral edge of which forms a major valve seat. In the arrangement shown the valve member is mounted by way of the rubber sealing member 12. The upper peripheral edge 31 of this aperture forms the major valve seat against which the valve head 29 is adapted to engage when the valving is closed. The sealing member 12 is a friction fit within the coupling part 2 and has a thin walled collapsible end portion 32 which in turn is a friction fit about the body portion of the valve 28 adjacent its end 28c as shown. The valve head 29 is loosely mounted about the valve stem 28b as shown. The valve head 29 is circular in plan view not shown and the stem 28b of the valve member 28 extends axially through an aperture 33 in the valve head 29. The upper edge 33a of this aperture 32 forms a minor valve seat. The valve head is retained on the valve stem 28b by an O ring 34 which forms an enlarged end portion of the same and which is adapted to engage the minor valve seat 33a when the valving is closed. In use when the coupling parts are disconnected as shown in Fig.5 the valve head 29 engages the major valve seat 31 and the O ring 34 in turn engages the minor valve seat 33a in the valve head, so that fluid flow past the valve is prevented. In use the valving will be maintained in this closed position by fluid pressure on the upstream side of the valve. When the coupling is connected, as the coupling parts 1 and 2 are brought together, the coupling part 1 contacts the end 28c of the valve member 28 and moves same such that the valve stem 28b moves through the valve head 29. The O ring 34 unseats from the minor seat 33a allowing a small initial flow of fluid through the valve head aperture 33 around the stem 28b. This flow of water contacts the major valve seat 31 assisting in lifting the valve head 29 therefrom so that as the coupling part 1 and valve member 28 moves further and physically lifts the valve head 29 from the seat 31 this initial water flow will tend to release pressure on the upstream side of the coupling to assist in enabling same. The valve head 29 may be shaped so as to assist this initial water flow lifting action. It is preferred, for example, for the bottom of the valve head to include radially extending slots, so that it has generally inverted castellated shape which is shown in Figs.5 and 6 .
