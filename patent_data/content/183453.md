# Composition comprising ceramic particles.

## Abstract
A homogeneous composition comprising 1 at least one particulate ceramic material, and 2 a liquid medium, in which the compositin comprises at least 50 by volume of particulate ceramic material, in which the particulate ceramic material and liquid medium are selected such that a test composition has a friction coefficient of less than 0.2, and in which the particulate ceramic material has a mean aspect ratio of less than 1.70, a shaped article produced from the composition, a shaped article from which the liquid medium has been removed, and a product in which the particles of ceramic material have been sintered.
