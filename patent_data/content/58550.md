# Method and apparatus for fabricating a tree resistant power cable.

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus for fabricating insulated cables, particularly polymeric insulated electrical power cables, resistant to the formation and growth of electrochemical trees is disclosed. Internal pressure on the conductor side of the cable is maintained lower than the external pressure on the outer surface of the insulation during extrusion. Extrusion pressure higher than the external pressure results in expansion of the insulation following extrusion. This expansion or swelling reduces the number and size of cracks and voids which are precursors of electrochemical trees. In addition, pressure curing the ex truded insulated cable with a curing medium above its melting point followed by gradual gradient cooling under internal pressure and higher external cooling fluid pressure to around room temperature optimises the resistance of the cable to nucleation and growth of electrochemical trees.

## Description
TREE RESISTANT POWER CABLE This invention relates to an improvement in the manufacture of insulated electric power cables. More specifically, it relates to a method and apparatus for improved fabrication of insulated cables that reduces insulation failures in underground sections of these cables. Power cables of the type here involved generally consist of the stranded conductor, an extruded semiconducting conductor shield, a polymeric insulation such as polyethylene PE , cross linked polyethylene XLPE , ethylene propylene rubber EPR and others , a semiconducting insulation shield, metallic shield, and optionally a polymeric jacket. It is recognised that when moisture, or other conducting liquid enters into the insulation structure of energised polymeric insulated cables it forms so called electrochemical trees in the areas of critical imperfections. These electrochemical trees consist of small channels that decrease the dielectric strength of the polymeric insulation. Microscopic observation of wafers taken from cross linked polyethylene cable insulation indicate that the electrochemical trees originate from cracks or oblong voids in the insulation adjacent to imperfections which consist of conducting particles or other foreign inclusions. This observation also indicates that the electrochemical trees are more plentiful in the portion of insulation adjacent to the conductor shield, becoming smaller and less numerous in the insulation close to the insulation shield in cables in which these three layers conductor shield, insulation and insulation shield are extruded, cured and cooled in a single operation.This characteristic was originally attributed to lower voltage stress at the insulation shield than at the centre of the insulation or at the conductor shield. Further studies now indicate that the main reason for this irregular distribution of these trees may be attributed to problems associated with the conventional, currently utilised manufacturing processes for polymeric insulated cables. These processes induce relatively small imperfections in the insulation close to the insulation shield. The severity of these imperfections in the insulation increases towards the conductor shield. Imperfections causing generation of electrochemical trees consist of small cracks and small or large voids, especially such cracks or voids that are oblong in the field direction, which, when filled with water create high electric stresses. Cracks in the insulation, although typically very small eg. less than 1 mil long , are believed to be the most common cause for formation of electrochemical trees. Under typical manufacturing conditions, in the case of cross linked polyethylene and ethylene propylene rubber insulated cables, the three layers conductor shield, insulation and insulation shield are extruded, crosslinked and cooled under pressure, or just extruded and cooled under pressure in the case of polyethylene insulated cables. In both cases the temperature of the three cable core layers, just before cooling, ranges from 250 to 550 degrees Fahrenheit. The thermal expansion coefficient of polyolefin insulation is relatively high. The volume of the insulation just before cooling is up to 10 to 16 larger than the volume of this insulation at room temperature.In conventional cable manufacturing processes, the coolant such as water, nitrogen, etc. is applied under pressure to the external surface of the extruded cable core.Hence, cooling and solidification begin from the external surface of the cable core and progress gradually towards the conductor. Before the cooling process begins, the insulation system is soft and is compressed against the conductor by the coolant. During cooling, the external part of the cable core solidifies and acts as a rigid pipe barrier, while the internal part of the insulation system, which is still soft, contracts and subsequently solidifies. Contraction and solidification of the internal soft part of the insulating system within the solidified external part of the cable core occur at a relatively low pressure because the pressure of the coolant is substantially diminished by the presence of the external solidified part of the cable core. Thus, the pressure at which the cable core is solidified equals the coolant pressure at the insulation shield surface, but this pressure decreases rapidly in the direction towards the conductor as the external pOrtion of the insulation solidifies. Consequently, the number and size of the imperfections which induce electrochemical trees and decrease dielectric strength of the insulation are smallest at the insulation shield side. The number and size of the imperfections increase towards the conductor shield where the voltage stress is the highest. Polymeric insulation structures are compressible.The liquid or gas pressure applied during the cooling of these structures compresses the solidified part of the cable core, but compensates only partially for the deficiency in compound volume during cooling of the internal part of the cable core. Consequently, the internal part of the cable core is cooled and solidified at a lower pressure than the outside. As the thickness of the wall of the insulation system increases, the greater is the pressure drop towards the conductor during cable core solidification and hence the level of imperfections formed. X During cable core cooling, especially in. the case of thermoset materials, the insulation structure also has an internal pressure created by vapours and gases generated by the cross linking reaction and also by the dispersion of contaminants such as air, steam and other vapours existing in the compounds.External pressure applied to the insulation system during its solidification tends to suppress the internal pressures from the gases in the insulation. This in turn reduces the void sizes in the insulation. Furthermore, application of external pressure during cooling causes mechanical stresses in the radial direction of the insulation system. When the cable core leaves the pressurised cooling pipe, the mechanical stresses relax, causing a small radial expansion of the insulation which facilitates the formation of cracks and oblong voids especially at contaminants and protrusions of the conductor and insulation shield layers. These cracks and voids constitute the most criticel imperfections in the insulation structure and lead to the formation of electrochemical trees and to the premature failure of the cable. Conventionally, in the manufacture of crosslinked polyethylene and ethylene propylene rubber insulated cables, pressure extrusion is utilised without internal gas or liquid pressure in the cable conductor and without gradient cooling of the cable core. It has been found that an increase in diameter or swelling of the cable core by more than 3 of the insulation shield diameter is necessary to reduce the number and size of the oblong voids in the insulation. In addition gradient cooling of the cured insulated cable is also necessary to reduce the number and size of the oblong voids in the insulation.Gradient cooling refers to a controlled gradual cooling of the cured insulated cable which takes place along the length of a cooling pipe. The cured insulated cable is gradually cooled from the temperature at which it leaves the curing section of the. pipe down to about room temperature at the end of the cooling section of the pipe furthest away from the curing section of the apparatus. Cooling of the cable core occurs in pressurised cooling tubes used in lines for manufacturing crosslinked polyethylene and ethylene propylene rubber insulated cables. However, the difference between the temperature of the cured insulated cable as it leaves the curing section and the temperature of the cooling medium adjacent to the curing section is too large. This temperature difference results in abrupt cooling leading to cables vulnerable to the formation of electrochemical trees. Gradient cooling has been used in polyethylene insulated cables. These cables have been found not to be resistant to the formation of electrochemical trees due to the absence of simultaneously applied internal and external pressure during the cooling. US Patent 3737490 discloses pressurisation of the conductor to produce an extruded composite covering. This covering comprises two or more layers of different covering materials extruded over a continuously advancing core by a float down process. Pressurisation is set forth in conjunction with the extrusion of cables having a diameter smaller than the diameter of the die of the extrusion head. Consequently the insulation structure produced by the prior art process is not compressed in the head and the die. Such a process has been found to lead to a porous insulation structure which is vulnerable to the formation of electrochemical trees. It has been found that in order to produce a cable with high dielectric strength, the cable insulation structure must be compressed in the head and in the die. The diameter of the cable exiting the die must be greater than the diameter of the die. It has now been found that polymer insulated cables having higher resistance to the formation and growth of electrochemical trees can be made by applying internal and external extrusion pressure to the conductor in combination with gradient cooling of the insulated cable. In addition, it has been found that the sensitivity of the polymeric insulated cables to the formation of electrochemical trees also depends on the medium used for curing and cooling, and on the type of compound used for insulation. It is established in accordance with this invention that each of the following steps reduces the formation of cracks and oblong voids in the insulation structure during its manufacturing process a extruding the insulation structure at high pressure and during subsequent curing and cooli ng subjecting the insulation structure to internal and external radial pressure slightly below the extrusion pressure b curing the insulation in a specially selected fluid c cooling the insulation with a gradual temperature gradient to minimise formation of cracks in the insulation, starting the cooling process at a temperature higher than the melting temperature of the curing compound and finishing the cooling process at around room temperature and d modifying the insulation compound to reduce its sensitivity to cracking. A method and means are provided whereby insulated power cable rated 10 kV and above having at least three layers conductor shield, insulation and insulation shield is i pressure extruded, ii pressurised internally from the stranded conductor side and externally from the insulation side , iii cured, and iv cooled under a temperature gradient starting at a temperature above the melting temperature of the insulation and gradually decreasing to room temperature or below. In so doing, the cracks and voids in the insulation are reduced in size and number, and are more uniformly distributed throughout the insulation. This in turn reduces insulation imperfections such as the abovereferenced sites for the development of electrochemical trees, and thereby extends the useful life of the new power cable. In one aspect the invention provides a method for fabricating an electrochemical tree resistant high voltage insulated cable, comprising the steps extruding under pressure over a continuously advancing stranded cable conductor a conductor shield, an insulation layer and an insulation shield applying internal pressure outwardly against the insulation layer through the conductor applying external pressure inwardly against the insulation layer, said external pressure being higher than said internal pressure solidifying the conductor shield, the insulation layer and the insulation shield by applying a curing medium under pressure to the outer surface of the insulation shield at a temperature above 2500F and or gradiently cooling the cable to approximately room temperature by means of a pressurised cooling fluid so as to maintain a temperature difference of not more than 1500F between. the conductor and the insulation shield and maintaining the internal pressure throughout said curing and cooling steps whereby formation of imperfections in the insulation layer that, when said cable is in service give rise to electro chemical trees, are reduced. In another aspect the invention provides an apparatus for extruding an insulation layer over an electrical conductor including means for accepting the conductor, means operatively connected to said accepting means for extruding the insulation layer over said conductor, means operatively connected to said extruding means for curing the insulation layer and means operatively connected to said curing means for cooling said insulation layer, the improvement comprising a source of pressurised fluid and means operatively connected to said accepting means for injecting said fluid into said conductor for applying pressure outwardly against the insulation layer during the cooling thereof by said cooling means. This invention can fabricate an improved insulated electric power cable rated 10 kV with reduction in the number and size of cracks and voids in the insulation and by a more uniform distribution of these voids in the insulation. By gradual curing and cooling of the insulation structure during the cable fabrication there is provided an improved, more failure resistant, cable. By controlling both the internal and external pressure exerted against the insulation coating of an electric power cable during its fabrication the reliability and performance characteristics of that insulation are improved when the cable is put in service, so that it resists breakdowns in insulation frequently encountered by contact with moisture in underground installations. And the method and apparatus used are relatively simple and inexpensive. Various embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, in conjunction with the appended drawings, in which Figure 1 is a partial cross section schematically illustrating the location and distribution of imperfections in a typical prior art insulated power cable Figure 2 is a graph of pressure against radial position qualitatively representing the pressure distribution in the insulation at times corresponding to the cooling stages of the insulation in a typical prior art insulated power cable Figure 3 is a cross section of an embodiment of a cable in accordance with the present invention Figures 4, 4a and 4b are schematic diagrams of three embodiments of an extrusion line suitable for fabricating cable in accordance with this invention Figure 5 is a graph representing the count of various lengths of electrochemical trees in a prior art cable and in one made in accordance with the invention Figure 6 is a graph representing the count of electrochemical trees longer than 2 mils, counted separately in five sections of the insulation structure and Figure 7 is a graph representing the electrochemical tree count of cables subjected to different curing operations in accordance with this invention. Referring to Figure 1, there is shown schematically the manner of distribution of voids or imperfections 10 between the conductor shield 2 and insulation shield 4 in a typical prior art power cable. Note that the imperfections are concentrated in the portion of the insulation 3 more closely adjacent to the conductor shield. The apparent reason for this is discussed above, ie. pressure distribution and temperature gradient during the insulation cooling process. Referring to Figure 2, the referenced pressure distribution is qualitatively represented. Curved t1 represents pressure distribution just prior to the cable core cooling. Curve t2 represents pressure distribution when a part of the external layer of the cable core is already solidified. Curve t3 represents pressure distribution in the cable core at a longer cooling time than that corresponding to curve t2 Referring now to Figure 3, the basic principle of the invention when used in conjunction with the horizontal mini pipe extrusion system described in USPatent No.4080131 is illustrated. The cable core consisting of conductor 1, conductor shield 2, insulation 3 and insulation shield 4 is cooled in a pipe 5 filled with a pressurised fluid cooling medium 6 such as steam, gas or other liquid.For illustration purposes, the insulation 3 is divided by the boundary 9 into two regions of solidified 7 and soft 8 insulation. During the cooling process, the boundary 9 moves towards the centre of the conductor. Referring to Figure 4 there is shown a schematic diagram of a first embodiment of a horizontal extrusion line for manufacture of cables in accordance with this invention. The extrusion line includes a metering capstan 101 for the stranded cable conductor 1. Conductor 1 passes through a seal 103 that minimises the overflow of gas or liquid which is introduced into the conductor 1 by pump 121 through an inlet 104. A pipe 105 which is attached to a single extrusion head 106 on one end and to seal 103 on the other end minimises the loss of gas or liquid delivered by pump 121. A conductor shield is pressure extruded over the conductor 1 by conductor shield extruder 108 in single head 106. The conductor and conductor shield then pass through gas pressurised tube 107, having one end sealed to the single head 106 and the other end sealed to a double head 130.The tube is pressurised with air or other gas as through inlet 132 by pump 131. An insulation layer is pressure extruded by extruder 133 over the conductor shield and an insulation shield is then pressure extruded by extruder 134 over the insulation layer ,in the dual head 130. The cable core 111 extruded by single head 106 and dual head 130 enters into a mini curing pipe 112, sealed on one end to the dual extrusion head 130 and on the other end to the cooling pipe 113. The core is cross linked with the help of a curing liquid introduced into curing pipe 112 through inlet 135 by pump 120. The curing pipe is heated t6 any desirable curing temperature by any conventional heating means. Subsequent to curing, the cable core 111 enters into the cooling pipe 113 which is supplier with cooling fluid by pump 119. The cooling fluid seal 114 prevents the cooling liquid from escaping the cooling system. The take up tension of the cable core is provided by the pull out capstan 115. The cable core is wound on the take up 116. The starting end 117 of the cable core is sealed by means of a reinforced end cup 118 for example a heat shrinkable or equivalent seal . In a second embodiment shown in Figure 4a there are two dual heads 106a and 130a. The conductor shield and a first insulation layer are pressure extruded in the first dual head 106a and a second insulation layer and the insulation shield are pressure extruded in the second dual head 130a. In the first dual head 106a the conductor shield is pressure extruded over the conductor by the extruder 108a. The first insulation layer is then pressure extruded over the conductor shield by extruder 109a in the first dual head 106a. The conductor, conductor shield and first insulation layer is passed through tube 107a into the second dual head 130a. A second insulation layer is pressure extruded over the first insulation layer by extruder 133a and an insulation shield is pressure extruded over the second insulation layer by extruder 134 a. The cable core 111 extruded by both dual heads 106a and 130a is then cured, gradiently cooled under pressure and wound on the take up 116 as described above as in the first embodiment. In a third embodiment shown in Figure 4b, there is only one head 106b. The head 106b is a triple extrusion head. The conductor shield is pressure extruded in head 106b over the conductor by extruder 108b. The insulation layer is then pressure extruded over the conductor shield in head 106b by extruder 133b. The insulation shield is then pressure extruded over the insulation layer in head 106b by extruder 134b. The cable core extruded in the triple head 106b is then cured gradually cooled under pressure and wound on the take up 116, as in the first two embodiments. Cables manufactured by such triple extrusion head 106b apparatus have been found on a statistical basis to have lower dielectric strength than cables manufactured with two layers of insulation as in the second embodiment.This is due to the fact that the first part of the insulation adjacent to the conductor shield will not be compressed as well as in the two dual head arrangements of the second embodiment. When the conductor 1 is pressurised by gas, a portion of the gas escapes to the environment through seal 103. The portion of gas that escapes to the environment can be minimised by using pipe 105 with a relatively tight fit to the conductor and by increasing the length of pipe 105. If the conductor is pressurised by means of a liquid, a special collector not shown similar to a water seal box can be used to collect the portion of the liquid that can escape through seal 103. The following apparatus design criteria and processing conditions are maintained to manufacture high quality polymeric insulated cables which are resistant to the formation of electrochemical trees 1. The gas or liquid pressure, maintained by pump 120, is higher than 50 psi preferably maintained below 500 psi and always lpwer than the cooling fluid pressure. 2. The head 106a is designed such that the die for the extrusion of the conductor shield constitutes one part with the tip of the die for the extrusion of the first part of the insulation. This construction ensures that the insulating compound continuously cleans the die of the conductor shield, preventing the accumulation of compound containing carbon black particles or carbon black clusters. These clusters would otherwise break off from ,the die and remain in the insulation and cause projections which lead to lower breakdown voltage and the formation of electrochemical trees in the insulation. 3. Both the conductor shield layer and the first part of the insulation layer are pressure extruded to minimise the formation of oblong voids in this part of the cable core. This is accomplished by maintaining the diameter of the first layer of the insulation slightly greater than the diameter of the die for the extrusion of this insulation. The thickness of the first part of the insulation is between 10 mils and 50 mils. 4. The gas pressure in tube 107 connecting the two heads 106 and 130 is at least 15 psi higher than the gas pressure introduced by pump 131 while at the same time at least 50 psi lower than the extrusion pressure in head 106. 5. The output of the compound from the insulation extruder is controlled so that the diameter of the cable core 111 exiting from heads 130, 130a and 130b into curing pipe 112 is at least 3 greater than the diameter of the die used for extrusion of the insulation shield. This difference in diameter assures high extrusion pressure of the insulation and minimises formation of voids, including oblong voids, which may result in electrochemical trees in wet cable environments. The diameter of the curing pipe 112 is greater than the diameter of the insulation shield die preferably by at least 5 but not greater than 50 of the diameter of the finished cable measured at room temperature. 6. The curing liquid pressure is not lower than 250 psi, preferably higher than 400 psi, and not lower, than the cooling fluid pressure. 7. The temperature of the cooling liquid in cooling pipe 113 at the connection point of cooling pipe 113 with curing pipe 112 is higher than the melting temperature of the compounds used for the manufacture of the cable core in order to minimise internal thermal stresses in the cable core and minimise cracks and voids in the insulation structure. Preferably the temperature at this connecting point is equal to the temperature of the curing liquid which is typically in the range of 240 to 5500F. The temperature of the cooling pipe should gradually decrease by gradient cooling. The gradient cooling should be selected to maintain a temperature difference between the conductor and the insulation shield of not more than 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Pressure extrusion with the pressurisation of the conductor and gradual gradient cooling of the insulation during cable core manufacture can also be applied to conventional extrusion, curing, cooling lines arranged vertically or in a catenary configuration and utilising steam, gas or liquid for curing and cooling of the cable core. In the case of a catenary line, the pipe 105 would have a catenary shape. Dry air or nitrogen are inexpensive gases suitable for pressurisation of the conductor. The conductor shield can also be pressurised during the manufacturing process with liquids or vaseline type compounds having a softening point slightly below the softening point of the compounds used for cable cores.Silicone fluid, microwaxes, compounds made of polyethylene dissolved in insulating oils and mixed with microwaxes or rubber and numerous other mixtures compatible with the cable insulating system can be used for pressurisation of the cable core during the manufacturing process. The vaseline type compounds, when left between the strands of the conductor of finished cables, prevent the longitudinal flow of moisture during cable service and thereby will further improve the resistance of the cables to formation of electrochemical trees. Referring to Figure 5, there is shown a graph representing electrochemical tree count in 15 kV crosslinked polyethylene insulated cables. Curve A relates to a conventional 15 kV cable and curve B relates .ta a 15 kV cable where the conductor shield was pressurised from the conductor side. during gradual gradient cooling with dry nitrogen at 60 .psi. Both cables were subjected to a 30 day exposure to water in the conductor area and the cable environment at 1500 Hz voltage, at a voltage stress of 85 volts per mil. The cable having its conductor shield pressurised during the gradual gradient cooling process curve B indicates a significant reduction in number and length of electrochemical trees. Referring to Figure 6, there is shown a graph representing another electrochemical tree count in 15 kV crosslinked polyethylene cables. Curve A relates to conventional 15 kV cable and curve B relates to a 15 kV pressure extruded cable where the conductor shield was pressurised from the conductor side with dry nitrogen at 90 psi and was cooled gradually by gradient cooling. Both cables were subjected to a 90 day exposure to water, in the conductor area and in the cable environment, at 60 Hz voltage, and voltage stresses of 85 volts per mil. In the tree count shown in Figure 6, the trees with length in excess of 2 mils were counted separattely in five sections of the insulation structure at the conductor shield in 1 3 of the insulation wall adjacent to the conductor shield, in 1 3 of the insulation located in the centre of the insulation wall, in 1 3 of the insulation adjacent to the insulation shield, and at the insulation shield. Figure 6 shows that the cable, pressure extruded and gradiently cooled under internal pressure develops much fewer trees than the cable manufactured in a conventional process. The internal pressure maintained in the pressure extruded cable during gradual gradient cooling minimised the size of the cracks and oblong voids. The samples of 15 kV crosslinked polyethylene insulated cables, having the tree count as shown in Figure 6, were subjected to an ac voltage breakdown test. In this test the ac voltage was increased in 10 percentage steps every minute. The average breakdown voltages measured, ïn three cable samples of both types of cables, are given in Table lt TABLE 1 XLPE Cable XLPE Cable pressure Conventional Extruded Heated and Process Cooled under Internal Pressurein Accordance with this inventionBreakdown VoltagePrior to treeing test kV 195 100 169 1008 After treeing test kV 70 36 72 43 The lower breakdown voltage before the treeing test of the cable made in accordance with the invention is attributed to a smaller insulation thickness caused by different processing conditions. Table 1 indicates that the decrease in breakdown voltage of the cable manufactured in accordance with the invention occurs at a significantly lower rate than the decrease of breakdown voltage of cable manufactured in a conventional way. After approximately three months of electrochemical treeing tests, the cable made in accordance with the present invention retained 43 of the original breakdown voltage while the cable of the conventional process retained only 368 of the original breakdown voltage. In addition it has been found that the sensitivity of the polymer insulated cables to formation of electrochemical trees also depends on the medium used for curing, and to some degree on the medium used for cooling of the cable core during the manufacturing process. Cable cores dry cured under hot gas pressure such as nitrogen or under a pressure of a hot high molecular weight liquid which does not penetrate into the insulation and cooled under water are very susceptible to formation and growth of electrochemical trees. On the other hand, cable cores cured by steam and cooled by water are less susceptible to formation of electromechnical trees, although, after manufacture, they contain more moisture and exhibit more and larger voids in the insulating system than the cable cores cured in nitrogen or high molecular weight liquids. Curing by steam has some negative and some positive effects on the insulation compound as compared with socalled dry curing performed under nitrogen or under high molecular weight liquid pressure. Steam entering the cable core during curing condenses in the insulation during cooling and forms microscopic, spherical voids which typically decrease the dielectric strength of the insulation, but do not nucleate electrochemical trees. The positive feature of steam curing is that steam minimises adverse effects of the crosslinking agent, facilitates cable expansion and contraction during curing and cooling and consequently decreases the number and size of microscopic cracks or oblong voids responsible for nucleation of electrochemical trees. Hence, cable cores cured in steam exhibit less susceptibility to formation of electrochemical trees than the cables cured and cooled by nitrogen or high weight. molecular liquids. The disadvantage of steam curing is that moisture is introduced into the cable core during the manufacturing process and this moisture may lead to electrochemical trees even if there is no external moisture admitted to the cable during testing or service. In order to further optimise cable resistance to nucleatiori and growth of electrochemical 1trees, the cable core should be cured under pressure exerted by a special curing medium. The curing medium should have good electrical properties, should have properties of a plasticiser, and should have the potential for diffusing into the insulation during the curing process. The curing medium may consist of a mixture of ingredients with at least one ingredient having the following properties Dielectric Constant 20 Resistivity 10 ohm cm Boiling Point at Curing Pressure 850C Molecular Weight. 300 Acetophenone, high molecular weight polybutene oil, glycerol, silicone fluid, dodecylbenzene, and other liquids satisfy these conditions.The special curing medium may be applied solely from the external side, or from both external and internal sides of the cable. Referring to Figure 7, this chart represents the effect of curing medium on the insulation and formation of electrochemical trees in 15 kV crosslinked polyethylene insulated cables subjected for 30 days to 1500 Hz voltage at voltage stress of 85 volts per mil with water surrounding the cable and filling the interstices of the conductor. During the curing process, these cables were not pressurised from inside. Curve C relates to a dry cured cable, curve D relates to a steam cured cable, and curve E relates to a cable cured in acetophenone. Furthermore it has been found that the type of insulating compound used has a significant effect on formation of cracks and voids in the insulation structure during the manufacturing process. Crosslinked polyethylene insulation extruded of copolymers such as ethylene and vinyl acetate or ethylene and ethyl acrylate is more resilient and more resistant to the formation of electrochemical trees than the insulation extruded from homopolymers. Copolymers are very widely used in insulating and semiconducting compounds filled with carbon black or clay particles because they can be well mixed with these particles to provide good adhesion between the compound and the particles.Copolymers, however, are not conventionally used in unfilled compounds designed for insulation in high voltage polymeric insulated cable rated 10 kV and above consisting of conductor shield, insulation and insulation shield. This is due to the fact that copolymers have higher loss factor, less resistance to thermal aging and higher price than the unfilled homopolymers, used as insulating compounds in crosslinked polyethylene insulated cables rated 15 kV and above. It has been found that crosslinked polyet hylene insulation made of unfilled copolymer is more resistant to formation of electrochemical trees than crosslinked polyethylene insulation made of unfilled homopolymers.This makes the unfilled copolymer insulation the preferred insulation for high voltage power cables of the present invention. Extension of service life of the polymeric insulation cables insulated with unfilled copolymer insulation overrides the above indicated apparent disadvantages of copolymer compounds. An unfilled insulation with a melt index 1 or higher, containing an unfilled copolymer with 5 or more of vinyl acetate or ethyl acrylate, is suitable for insulation of high voltage power cables resistant to formation and growth of electrochemical trees. In order to demonstrate the resistance of the copolymer insulation to formation of electrochemical trees, a special series of tests on miniature cables was made. Miniature XLPE insulated cables 50 mils of insulation thickness have been manufactured with insulation made of 1 conventional Union Carbide 4201R compound and 2 with ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer with a melt index 2, and containing 15 of vinyl acetate. After manufacture, both cables were subjected to heat treatment to diffuse out the byproducts of the crosslinking reaction. Spbsequently, the cables were subjected to an electrochemical treeing test at 4.3 kV, 60 Hz ac for 24 days with water in the conductor and in the cable environment ac breakdown voltages were measured on both cables after heat treatment only and after heat treatment and electrochemical treeing tests.The results in a form of average breakdown voltages 10 increase every 5 minutes , obtained on ten samples in each case, are summarised in Table 2 TABLE 2 Cables made of Ethylene Union Carbide Vinyl 4201R XLPE Acetate Compound CopolymerBreakdown Voltage afterHeat Treatment only kV 45 100 42 100 Breakdown Voltage afterHeat Treatment andElectrochemical TreeingTest kV 35 75 47 112 Table 2 indicates that within 24 days of electrochemical treeing test, breakdown voltage of conventional cables decreased by 22 while of the cables made of copolymer type compound increased by 12 . The latter increase in the breakdown voltage is attributed to relaxation of the insulation during the electrochemical treeing test. If, during the test, electrochemical trees would have been developed in this insulation, the breakdown voltage would have decrease in spite of the insulation relaxation. It will be understood that the foregoing description of preferred embodiments of the present invention is for purposes of illustration only, and that the various structural and operational features as herein disclosed are susceptible to a number of modifications and changes, none of which entails any departure from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the hereto appended claims.
