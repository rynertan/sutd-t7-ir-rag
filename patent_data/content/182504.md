# AN ASSEMBLY OF FLEXIBLE CARRIER AND SOLID COMPONENTS, AND METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING AND FOR HANDLING SAME.

## Abstract
A flexible substrate assembly 10 includes an elongated flexible substrate 16 having a plurality of spaced apart com ponent receiving regions P1 , with a solid component 12 dis posed on each of said regions. A plurality of flexible strap mem bers 18 are disposed adjacent each component receiving re gion on one side thereof, and are joined to the other side of the region such that the strap overlies the region to form a tube like passageway 14 for receiving and containing a solid compo nent 12 . Different configurations of strap members 44 or 64 or 92 see Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are punched out from a single sheet of flexible substrate so as to form the tube like passageway in further embodiments. Also disclosed are methods for fabricat ing the substrate assembly and for dispensing solid compo nents 12 from the substrate assembly. Also, packaging ar rangements and apparatus for making the packaging arrange ments including the flexible substrate assembly are disclosed.
