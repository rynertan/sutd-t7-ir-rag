# IMPROVED SAFETY SHIELD CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
Disclosed is an encoder decoder interrogation system useful for determining the condition of safety shields or the like which are intended to protect users of equipment having potentially hazardous work stations. The interrogation sys tem may comprise a plurality of encoders positioned on a stationary portion of the equipment. Each of the encoders has an associated decoder positioned on a safety shield or closure member. When the decoder on the safety shield is properly juxtaposed with its associated encoder in a predetermined orientation, it becomes operable to close a circuit path through the encoder. A scanner is provided for selectively and sequentially transmitting an interrogation signal to each of the encoders and in turn receiving signals from each of the encoders in response to the interrogation signal. A timer is operatively connected to the scanner for timing the period between the sending of a scanner interrogation signal and the receipt of an encoder response signal. If no response signal is received by the scanner before the elapse of a predetermined period of time, the timer will emit a fault signal which is operable to shut down the equipment.
