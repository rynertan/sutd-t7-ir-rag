# Ampoule inspecting method.

## Abstract
A method for inspecting transparent or semitransparent, liquid filled containers A as to whether or not the liquid in each of the container A contains foreign matters. The inspection is carried out by passing the container A in front of a television camera 6 while the liquid in each container undergoes a spiral motion as it passes through an inspection region, and processing video signals generated from the television camera 6 by the use of a unique controlling circuit 11 . With this controlling circuit 11 , distinction can be made between signals indicative of the presence of foreign matters in the liquid and that indicative of the presence of external flaws on the container.
