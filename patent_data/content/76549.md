# Low fat spread and process for producing same.

## Abstract
Spreads containing 20 60 , preferably 30 50 fat com prising i a dispersed phase consisting of a cream comprising water, oil present as droplets with an average diameter of 0.1 2 microns, a thickening agent and heat denatured whey protein as an emulsion stabilizer and ii a continuous fat phase. Said spreads are produced by a process involving a preparing a cream containing whey protein in substantially native state b heating said cream at 80 95 C to denature the protein c emulsifying the cream in a continuous fat phase and d cooling and texturizing the o w o emulsion obtained to produce a plastic spread.
