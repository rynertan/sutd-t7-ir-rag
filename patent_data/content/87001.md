# A process for the manufacture of absorbent materials.

## Abstract
Absorbent material comprising clay mineral particles, the particles comprising compacted massees of relatively smaller particles is found to have high absorbency which may be further increased by the use of additives such as silicates, pyrophosphates swelling clays, polysaccharides or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. Preferred are smectites, attapulgite or sepiolite preferably in the form of particles in below 1.4 mm, preferably below 710 microns in the size range compacted into larger particles in the 710 micron to 4 mm size range. The absorbent particles are suitable for use as pet litter.
