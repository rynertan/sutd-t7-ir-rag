# IMPROVED POLARITY SWITCH FOR SATELLITE TELEVISION RECEIVER

## Abstract
An improved polarity switch for connection between a dual antenna system and a satellite television reception system has a first embodiment which utilizes a pin diode switch between the dual antenna system and each of a plurality of receivers to permit use of the receiver to select one of the two antenna feeds for decoding and display at that television set. A second embodiment is also disclosed which utilizes an electromechanical relay to isolate the antenna feeds from each receiver.
