# A fire suppression system for use within a passenger area of a transportation vehicle.

## Abstract
The conventional potable water distribution system 310, 318 or other water supply system conventionally pro vided in passenger aircraft and other large passenger vehi cles such as boats and trains may be modified to provide a convenient source of water under high pressure 300, 302 for fire suppression purposes. A mobile cart 10 that can conveniently stowed inside the passenger area is provided with a source of foaming agent 132, 134 , a mixing nozzle 148 , and the required valves and hoses 128, 142, 150 . A plurality of pressurized water outlets may be located throughout the passenger area. The cart s water inlet hose 128 is provided with a suitable quick connect disconnect fitting 130 . In order to provide the greatest versatility and effectiveness, the mixing nozzle 148 is provided with a convenient control 168 whereby the operator may choose between a heavy mist of plan water, a relatively dense foam, or a relatively light foam. As a result, it is possible to provide more effective fire suppression than if it were necessary to equip a number of individual fire fighting stations within the cabin. Furthermore, since the cart utilizes an existing supply of water 310 , a substantial quantity of water is made available for emergency use at no additional cost or weight penalty.
