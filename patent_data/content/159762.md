## Description
AN AGRICULTURAL MACHINE This invention relates to an agricultural machine comprising a hopper and a frame provided with coupling points for hitching the machine to a prime mover, such as a tractor or a similar vehicle. Agricultural machines of this kind are known, and are used in particular for applying granular and or powdery material to agricultural land, for example for distributing seeds or fertilizers. An object underlying the present invention is to improve such an agricultural machine so that it can be effectively moved by the tractor. According to the present invention, the machine comprises a second hopper, the rear wall of which is, as viewed on plan, ahead of the rear of the first hopper, the two hoppers communicating with each other to enable material to pass from one of the hoppers to the other. In this way the centre of gravity of the agricultural machine is positioned nearer to the place where the agricultural machine is coupled to the lifting device of the prime mover. When the hoppers are full of, for example, seed or fertilizer, this can be particularly advantageous in the operation of the agricultural machine. An advantageous embodiment is obtained when the hoppers communicate with each other through a duct or channel shaped connecting member extending between the interior of the second hopper and that of the first hopper. A practical, effective embodiment is obtained when the part of the connecting member adjoining the first hopper has an adjustable outlet so that the position of the end of the outlet can be adjusted with respect to the bottom of the first hopper. During use of the machine, the degree of filling of the first hopper can be kept low by positioning the end of the outlet near the bottom of the first hopper. In this way, when the second hopper is full, the centre of gravity of the machine can lie very near the lifting device so that the machine may be used with smaller tractors or in combination with other machines coupled with the tractor. In a preferred embodiment the agricultural machine can be coupled with the lifting device of a tractor or a similar vehicle through a connecting construction in the form of a pivotable quadilateral. The machine can then be effectively movable upwardly and downwardly during operation, when the agricultural machine is combined with a second agricultural machine, for example a soil cultivating machine. A practical embodiment of the agricultural machine is obtained when the second hopper is disposed above the soil cultivating machine and the first hopper is disposed behind the soil cultivating machine. The first hopper may cooperate with a spreading mechanism or a seed drill or other sowing or planting device, the second hopper being provided for seed or fertilizer and having at least one feed connection with the first hopper so that during operation material can pass from the second hopper to the first hopper. For a better understanding of the present invention and to show how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of agricultural equipment hitched to a tractor Figure 2 is a plan view of the equipment of Figure 1 taken in the direction of the arrow II in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a rear view of the equipment of Figure 1 taken in the direction of the arrow III in Figure 1 Figure 4 is a fragmentary sectional view, on an enlarged scale, taken on the line IV IV in Figure 2 Figure 5 is a plan view of further agricultural equipment hitched to a tractor and Figure 6 is a side view of the equipment of Figure 5 taken in the direction of the arrow VI in Figure 5. The agricultural equipment shown in Figures 1 to 4 comprises a seed drill 1. The seed drill has a first hopper 2 provided with seed pipes 3 and wheels 4. At the front, the seed drill 1 has a coupling member 5 situated midway across the width of the machine near the top. Two coupling members 6 are situated in the lower region of the hopper 2. The coupling members 5 and 6 are fastened to a carrying frame 7 by coupling pins 8. The carrying frame 7 has an upper coupling lug 9 and two lower coupling lugs 10. The coupling lugs 9 and 10 are pivotally connected by connecting pins 11 to a top arm 12 and two lower arms 13, respectively. The arms 12 and 13 comprise a pivotal construction 14 connected by connecting pins 15 to a mounting trestle 16 of a further agricultural machine 17 in the form of a soil cultivating machine.Movement limiting members in the form of chains 18 extend between the trestle 16 and the arms 13. The chains 18 extend from a connecting lug 19 of the trestle to connecting lugs 20 on the top of each lower arm 13. The carrying frame 7 comprises two carrying beams 25, which slope upwardly from the top of the carrying frame 7 towards the front, with respect to the normal direction of operative travel of the equipment, as indicated by an arrow 26.The top ends of the carrying beams 25 support a second hopper 27 of the seed drill 1. The hopper 27 is covered at the top by a pivotable cover 28. The rear wall 29 of the hopper 27 is a distance 30 ahead of the front wall 31 of the hopper 2. The distance 30 is larger than the width 32 of the hopper 27, as measured in the direction 26. The width 32 is substantially equal to the width 33 of the hopper 2. Measured transversely of the direction 26, the two hoppers have equal widths 34. A platform 35 is supported on the carrying beams 25 near the rear wall 29 of the hopper 27. Outlet ports 40 are provided in the lower region of the rear wall 29 of the hopper 27. Connecting members 41 are connected to the outlet ports 40. The connecting members 41 comprise conduits of, preferably, flexible material in this case they are plastics hoses. A plurality of the ports 40 are provided at equal distances from one another across the whole width 34 of the hopper 27. The connecting members 41 adjoining the ports 40 are mutually parallel. In the illustrated embodiment, there are seven connecting members 41 connected to the underside of the hopper 27. The connecting members 41 slope downwardly towards the rear from the underside of the hopper 27, with respect to the direction 26. They open into the hopper 2. The lower ends of the connecting members 41 are all connected to a cover 42 of the hopper 2, which thus serves as a connecting piece.The connecting members 41 are parallel to the frame beams 25 and lie below the platform 35. The connecting members 41 are supported by brackets 43 mounted on a transverse beam 44, which is connected to the beams 25. The lower ends 45 of the connecting members 41 extending into the hopper 2 each have an outlet part 46 which is displaceable in the lengthwise direction of the respective lower end 45.These outlet parts 46 are thus displaceable upwardly and downwardly with respect to the lower ends 45 and can be fixed at will in any one of a plurality of positions, in a manner which is not shown in detail. The seed drill 1 has two supporting legs 47 spaced laterally of the machine one on each side of the carrying frame 7. These legs 47 are displaceable upwardly and downwardly in sleeves 48 provided on the carrying frame. A retaining bolt 49 is provided for fixing the legs 47 at will in any one of at least two vertically spaced positions with respect to the carrying frame 7. Supporting legs 51 are provided on both sides near the front wall 50 of the hopper 27.These legs 51 are displaceable in sleeves 52 fastened to the frame beams 25. The supporting legs 51 can be fixed by retaining bolts 53 at will in any one of at least two different positions with respect to the sleeve 52. When the machine stands on horizontal ground, the front wall 50 of the hopper 27 is situated substantially vertically above supporting lugs 55 and 56 of the trestle 16, by means of which the soil cultivating machine 17 can be coupled to a top lifting arm 57 and lower lifting arms 58 of a three point lifting device of a tractor 59. The soil cultivating machine 17 shown in this embodiment has soil cultivating members 60 which are rotatable about vertical axes and are connected by transmission members not shown with a gearbox 61.The gearbox 61 can be coupled by an auxiliary shaft 62 with the power take off shaft of the tractor. The machine comprises a supporting roller 63. When the seed drill is put into use, it is fastened by the pins 11 to the pivotal construction 14. The beams 12 and 13, are parallel to each other as viewed from the side, and the pivotal pins 11 and the connecting pins 15 lie at the corners of a quadrilateral. The resulting pivotal construction 14 supports the seed drill î for upwards and downwards movement and connects it to the trestle 16 of the agricultural machine 17. The trestle 16 connects the seed drill 1 to the three point lifting device of the tractor 59. The see drill 1 is supported by the ground wheels 4. During operation, the equipment comprising the seed drill 1 and the agricultural machine 17 is driven by the tractor 59 in the direction of the arrow 26.The soil cultivating members 60 then work the soil over a width equal to the width of the soil cultivating machine, this width, in this embodiment, being substantially equal to the width of the seed drill 1. The seed drill 1 is supported independently by the ground wheels 4 so that it can move upwardly and downwardly independently of the machine 17 by pivotal movement of the construction 14 with respect to the trestle 16 about the pivotal axes constituted by the pins 11 and 15. Since the construction 14 with the pins 11 and 15 constitutes a pivotable parallelogram structure, the seed drill 1, when moving with respect to the trestle 16, is maintained in its horizontal orientation by the pivotal construction 14. The seed pipes 3 of the seed drill 1 guide seeds and or other granular and or powdery substances such as a fertilizer behind the soil cultivating machine to the ground. The material to be delivered by the seed pipes is fed from the first hopper 2 to the seed pipes 3.The hopper 2 receives material through the connecting members 41 from the second hopper 27. This hopper 27 is disposed considerably further to the front with respect to the direction 26 than the hopper 2.Therefore, the weight of the seed drill 1, particularly when the hopper 27 is full, acts at a relatively forward position close to the lifting device of the tractor. This is important to permit lifting of the combination of the seed drill 1 and the agricultural machine 17 by means of the lifting device of the tractor 59 when the cultivating members 60 have to be lifted from the ground, for example when turning at the head land of a field or for road transport of the combination. When the lifting device of the tractor is raised to lift the soil cultivating machine 17, the seed drill 1 will follow this movement because the limiting member 18 is set so that the seed drill 1 can move downwards for only a small distance with respect to the agricultural machine 17 when in the working position its tines 60 have penetrated to a greater or lesser extent into the soil.The member 18 thus causes the seed drill 1 to move upwards with the agricultural machine 17. Since the centre of gravity of the whole machine 1 is situated towards the front, lifting of the entire combination can be readily carried out. For this purpose also, the hopper 27 is positioned, as in this embodiment, as far as possible to the front so that its front wall is quite near the tractor. The front wall 50 of the hopper is substantially directly above the ends of the arms 57 and 58. In order to have as much as possible of the weight of the seed drill 1 towards the front, the hopper 2 may be kept only partly full during operation. For this purpose the displaceable outlet part 46 can be moved down as far as possible so that its end 64 is as close as possible to the bottom of the hopper 2. Thus only the lower part of the hopper 2 contains material. The level of the material in the hopper 2 is determined by the end 64 of the outlet element 46 of each connecting member 41. With this arrangement, the combination of the machines 1 and 17 can be used with relatively lightweight tractors without the risk of them tilting rearwardly when the combination of the machines 1 and 17 is lifted.Moreover, the effort required for lifting the combination of the machines 1 and 17 need not be excessive because the centre of gravity of the machine 1, even when the hopper 27 is full, is disposed towards the front. This provides an advantageous combination with the hopper 27 above the machine 17.The rear wall 29 is positioned far towards the front and is nearer to the lifting device than is the rear wall 22 of the hopper 2. It is advantageous for the distance 30 to be larger than the width 32 or 33. The wall 29 is located far ahead of the transverse central plane 23 going through the centre of the hopper 2. The seed drill 1 can be uncoupled from the machine 17 by removing the pins 15. In order to leave the seed drill 1 standing on the ground in an advantageous manner, the supporting legs 47 and 51 can be lowered until their lower ends bear on the ground to support the machine in cojunction with the ground wheels 4. In this lowered position and in the position shown inFigure 1 these legs can be fixed with respect to the frame. The hopper 27 can be readily filled from the platform 35, which is also suitable for checking whether or not the material is flowing sufficiently regularly from the hopper 27 through the outlet ports 40 to the feed connecting members 41. The hopper 2, the seed pipes 3 and the wheels 4 can be disengaged from the rest of the seed drill 1 as a unit by removing the pins 8 so that the tongues 5 and 6 are disconnected from the carrying frame 7. To do this, the end portions 45 of the feed members 21 are released from the cover 42 or are removed with the cover 42 from the hopper 2. This released unit may then be coupled on its own to the lifting device of the tractor for sowing, for example, on smaller plots of land. When the combination of the machines 1 and 17 is used with a heavy agricultural tractor, the hopper 2 can also be fully filled so that a large quantity of material can be carried. The material to be spread on the ground can then initially be supplied from the hopper 2. When the hopper 2 is almost empty, the lower part can be refilled from the hopper 27 through the feed members 41. In this way a high amount of material can be carried by the agricultural machine 1 for providing large plots of land with seeds or other material without the need for frequent re filling. In the embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 4, the hoppers 2 and 27 have about the same capacity as each other, but they may have different capacities. The hopper 2 may have a considerably smaller capacity than the hopper 27, for example, if the hopper 2 is smaller and the hopper 27 is larger than in the illustrated embodiment. In the illustrated embodiment, the two hoppers 2 and 27 have, as viewed on plan, equal surfaces. These too may be different. The connection of the seed drill 1 to the quadrilateral construction 14 on the trestle 16 of the agricultural machine 17 can be established in a simple manner by hitching the machine 17 to the lifting device and by then driving it backwards beneath the hopper 27 and the frame beams 25 of the seed drill 1 supported on the legs 51 and 47 and an the wheels 4. For this purpose the legs 59 are sufficiently spaced apart and converge upwardly. In the working position the machine 1 is no broader than the machine 17. Although in this embodiment the agricultural machine 1 is a seed drill, it could be a different agricultural machine having a hopper or other container carrying material. In the following claims, the term hopper has been used to refer to all such containers, including, for example, tanks for liquid materials. For example, the machine may be a planting machine also having two hoppers, one of which, like the hopper 2, is situated near mechanisms for performing given operations, whereas more of the material to be carried is container in a second hopper, corresponding to the hopper 27. The connection between the two hoppers may also be different from the conduit feed connections 41 of this embodiment, For example, channel shaped or duct shaped members may be used which have a larger cross section, or the feed connection may be a hollow, flat cylinder covering a larger width of the machine.The plurality of hollow parts 41 could all be replaced by a single, flat feed conduit covering the whole width of the hoppers 27 and 2. When the agricultural machine is coupled with the trestle 16, the length of the limiting members 18 formed in this embodiment by a chain can be adjusted to set the limit of downwards movability of the agricultural machine 1 with respect to the agricultural machine 17. Figures 5 and 6 show an agricultural machine embodying the invention in the form of a spreader 70.This spreader comprises a first hopper 71 supported on a frame 72 provided with coupling members 73 and 74 for hitching the spreader to the top and lower lifting arms 75 and 76 of the lifting device of a tractor 77. The spreader 70 comprises a distributing member 78 which is disposed below a delivery part not shown of the hopper 71 and is rotatable about an upwardly extending rotary axis 79. In this embodiment the axis 79 coincides with the centre line of the hopper 71.Viewed on plan, the hopper 72 has a width 80 and a length 82 measured in the normal direction of operative travel of the spreader, as indicated by an arrow 81.The hopper 71 has a height 83 and its rectangular top tapers downwardly to the underside 84, where dosing members not shown may be provided for controlling the rate of flow of material from the hopper 71 to the distribution member 78. The distributing member 78 is connected by transmission members in a gearbox 85 to an auxiliary shaft 86, which can be connected to the power take off shaft of the tractor. The spreader 70 is provided with a second hopper 87, which is fastened to the top of the first hopper 71. The hopper 87 is entirely situated ahead of a plane 88 extending transversely of the direction 81 and containing the rotary axis of the distribution member 78. Viewed on plan, the second hopper 87 occupies an area which is about half of the area of the hopper 71, as viewed on plan.The hopper 87 has a width equal to the width 80 and a length 89 measured in the direction 81 which is about half the length 82 of the hopper 71. The second hopper 87 has a height 90 which is about equal to the height 80 of the hopper 71. The hopper 87 has the same circumference throughout the height 90, in other words its walls are parallel. The underside of the hopper 87 is fully open and adjoins the open top of the hopper 71 so that the underside of the hopper 87 constitutes a connecting passage with the open top of the hopper 71.In view of its shape, the centre of gravity of the hopper 87 is approximately midway across the width 80 and the length 89 and midway up the height 90. This centre of gravity is ahead of the transverse plane 88 by a distance equal to half the distance 89. For use, the spreader 70 is hitched to the lifting device as is shown in Figures 5 and 6. The distribution member 78 is connected with the power take off shaft of the tractor by the auxiliary shaft 86 and the transmission in the gearbox 85. During operation the distribution member 78 is rotated about the rotary axis 79 and material is fed from the first hopper 71 to the distribution member 78 for spreading over a broad strip during travel of the spreader in the direction indicated by the arrow 81. A large amount of material can be carried in the two hoppers 71 and 87 so that a large surface can be covered with the material such as fertilizer without interruption. The machine is, therefore, quite suitable as an agricultural machine for spreading granular or powdery material, for example fertilizer.Since the centre of gravity 91 of the second hopper 87 is located relatively far to the front, the centre of gravity of the machine, even with the hoppers 81 and 87 full, will be relatively near the tractor. Consequently, the spreader 70 with rather high capacity hoppers can be used on a tractor which is not too heavy. The risk of tilting backwards of the tractor with the attached agricultural machine or machines with completely filled hoppers is thus considerably reduced. In particular safe and simple operation on uneven or sloping land is possible.Moreover, the lifting device is more advantageously loaded. The location of the centre of gravity of the agricultural machine with filled hoppers is particularly advantageous because the rear wall 93 of the hopper 87 is a distance 92 from the rear wall 94 of the hopper 71. The distance 92, as in the illustrated embodiment, is preferably larger than half the length 82 of the hopper 71 so that the rear wall 93 is ahead of the transverse plane 88. The construction embodying the invention enables relatively large amounts of material to be carried in the hoppers without disadvantageous load on the tractor by the machine or the whole combination of agricultural machines. Since the centre of gravity of the agricultural machine with the two hoppers is situated relatively near to the lifting device, the tractor need not be provided with weights at the front in order to prevent it from tilting backwards. Consequently, the wheel pressure on the ground is not increased undesirably, with the advantage that the ground is compressed as little as possible and deterioration of the soil structure is avoided. This advantage is the greater because a less heavy tractor can be used. Whilst various features of the machines that have been described, and that are illustrated in the drawings, will be set forth in the following claims as inventive features, it is to be noted that the invention is not necessarily limited to these features and that it encompasses all of the features that have been described both individually and in various combinations.
