# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING STAMPER

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a stamper having a high density and a low reject rate. An organic film formed on the substrate is irradiated with a charged particle beam such as an electron beam or ion beam, in order to form a rugged pattern on the organic film so as to use it as a stamper. Namely, the stamper is directly formed without passing through the steps of forming, first, a mother disc and then forming a stamper from the mother disc. Therefore, the number of steps is reduced and the reject rate is reduced, too, making the method ideal for the manufacture of stampers for high density optical discs.

## Description
Technical Field The present invention relates to a method of producing a stamper for optical disks, and particularly to a method of producing stamper having a high density and a low defect rate.Background Art P . Optical disks such as optical video disks, compact audio disks, and optical memory disks have heretofore been prepared in the order of a master disk 1, a stamper 2, and a replica 3 as shown in Fig. 1. Performance of the optical disks is determined by the shape of pits or grooves formed on the disk to produce signals, and extraneous rough patterns that do not contribute to signals, i.e , the size of defects and the number of defects.Their shapes are almost determined in the processes of forming the master disk and stamper. In these processes, o therefore, it is necessary to form the pits or grooves in accordance with the specified shapes while suppressing the defect rate as small as possible. According to a conventional method as shown inFig. 1, pits or grooves for producing signals are formed in the master disk by the photo lithography. using a laser beam, rugged patterns of photoresist 4 on a glass plate 5 are transferred to an electrically conductive layer 6 or a nickel plating 7 that will be used as a stamper 2. Or, using the stamper 2 as a master, the patterns are transferred again to the electrically conductive layer or the nickel plating as described above to use it as a mother. Relying upon the thus obtained mother, the patterns are transferred to the electrically conductive layer or the nickel plating for the third time, thereby to form a stamper metal moid . This presents an advantage that large numbers of the same replicas can be produced at the saem time, since plural mothers are formed. Using the stampers, there are produced a large number of replicas 3 by injection molding, pressing, or by using an ultraviolet curable resin for example, refer toJapanese Patent Laid Open No. 116105 1978 . The master disk is formed by photo lithography, and nickel is plated thereon. In other words, the processes for forming the master disk and the stamper are so lengthy and complex, that dust and dirt often stick to the master disk and the stamper during these processes,and that makes it difficult to prevent defects from occurring. Rough patterns of signals become more fine with the increase of the density of recorded data, and whereby the problem of defects become more serious. Therefore, it has become urgent to provide a process which lowers the defect rate.Disclosure of Invention The object of the present invention is to provide a method of producing stamper having a low defect rate. To achieve the above object according to the present invention, an organic layer formed on a substrate is irradiated with a beam of charged particles, such as electron beam or ion beam, to form rough patterns on the organic layer so as to use it as a stamper. According to the present invention, the stamper is formed directly without passing through the steps of preparing, first, the master disk and then forming the stamper from the master disk. Namely, the production steps are simplified to limit the development of defects. The stamper must have durability to produce replicas in large numbers. With the stamper of the present invention, the organic layer formed on the substrate is cured with an ion beam to increase durability, or a metal layer is formed by sputtering on the surface of the organic layer and of the substrate to further increase durability.Brief Description of Drawings Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram showing a conventional method of producing an optical disk Figs. 2 and 3 are diagrams showing embodiments according to the present invention Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram showing an apparatus for producing stamper according to the present invention and Fig. 5 is a diagram showing the preparation of a replica using the stamper obtained according to the present invention.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention The invention will be described below by way of embodiments. Fig. 2 shows an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 2 a , first, an electron beam resist 10 such as PMMA AN polymethyl methacrylateacrylonitrile is applied onto a substrate 11 which consists of a glass, silicon or a metal. The surface of the substrate may have been treated for example, a primer coating may have been applied onto the surface of the substrate to maintain adhesiveness to the resist.In Fig. 2 b , the rotating stamper is irradiated with an electron beam 12 at a predetermined position, so that raised, bonded molecules of the resist are cut to form a latent image 13. The substrate is heated at, for example, 1500C to 1800C for 30 minutes. The resist portions 13 where the bond cut off to acquire a low molecular weight, evaporate, resulting in the formation of pits as denoted by 14 in Fig. 2 c . The substrate under this condition can be used as the stamper. As shown in Fig. 2 d , furthermore, a metal 15 such as nickel is deposited by sputtering on the resist 10, to obtain the stamper that exhibits increased durability. According to this method, rough patterns can be continuously formed on the resist using an electron beam drawing apparatus in a vacuum without permitting the infiltration of dust or dirt, thereby enabling the defect rate to be greatly reduced. Fig. 3 shows another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 3 a , an organic layer 20 is applied or vaporized onto a substrate 21. The organic layer may be a photosensitive resin such as resist, or may be a non photosensitive resin such as epoxy resin.Next, as shown in Fig. 3 b , the surface is irradiated with an ion beam 22 according to a predetermined pattern.The ion beam may be argon ions. Then, due to the reaction with ions, etching takes place on the irradiated portions to form pits 23, thereby forming a predetermined rough pattern. Then, the surface is uniformly irradiated with a different kind of ion beam such as boron ions, phosphorus ions, gallium ions or like ions as shown inFig. 3 c to cure carbonize the organic layer.Thus, there is obtained a stamper having durability. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, after the rough pattern is formed in the resist portion by the electron beam i .e., after the step of Fig. 2 c , the organic layer may be irradiated with the beam of phosphorus ions so as to be cured. It is further allowable to irradiate the organic layer with the ion beam to cure it step of Fig. 3 c and then to deposite a metal film by sputtering on the surface of rugged portions, in order to increase the strength of the stamper. Fig. 4 schematically shows an apparatus for producing a stamper for putting the invention into practice, wherein reference numeral 30 denotes a charged bemm focusing system, 36 denotes a differential exhaust system, and 40 denotes an oven sputter chamber. The charged beam emitted from a charge beam source 31 is accelerated by an anode 32, and is focused on a disk 37 that is to be worked through condenser lenses 33, a deflecting lens 34 and an object glass 35. The electron beam is deflected by a deflection signal 43 to control the position of rugged portion. The disk moves helically relative to the charged bear being driven bya motor 38 and a feed motor 39 like in the conventional mastering machine for optical disk. In the apparatus for producing a stamper for putting the present invention into practice, in particular, use is made of the differential exhaust system 36 having layers of different degrees of vacuum. Therefore, the system for rotating the disk can be operated in the open air.This is because, the differential exhaust system can change the degree of vacuum between the charged beam focusing system 30 and the oven sputter chamber 40.Hence, a pneumatic bearing can be used. The disk is placed in the oven sputter chamber 40 and is heated by blowing a clean gas 41 at a high temperature to evaporate the portions irradiated with the charged beam. After the irradiation has been finished, the disk is moved to a place under a sputtering electrode 42 where the disk is rotated and is provided with a layer such as nickel by sputtering. The metal film may be formed by vapor deposition instead of sputtering. In this ca se, the interior of the chamber 40 is evacuated as a matter of course. Though not shown in the drawings, the differential exhaust is also applied to the spindle portion of disk 37. In Fig. 4, irradiation of the charged beam and the sputtering are effected in the same apparatus. They, however, may be effected in separate apparatuses. Fig. 5 shows a method of producing replica from the stamper obtained according to the present inventionThe stamper obtained by the invention has a surface which is softer than that of the conventional nickel cast stamper, and can suitably be prepared by using an ultraviolet curable resin or by the casting rather than the pressing or the injection molding. Fig. 5 shows the method of using an ultraviolet curable resin. In Fig. 5 a , an ultraviolet curable resin 51 is placed on a stamper 50.Then, a substrate 52 made of a glass or a light transmitting resin of which the surface has been treated with a primer, is pressed onto the resin 51 on the stamper 50, the substrate 52 being formed into a cup shape by depressing the central portion thereof and drawing the peripheral portion thereof. With the substrate 52 pushed being curved like a cup, the resin is uniformly formed on the surface of the glass or the resin. Referring to Fig. 5 b where the resin 51 is spread maintaining a uniform thickness between the substrate 52 and the stamper 50, ultraviolet rays are applied by an ultraviolet lamp 53 from the side of the substrate to cure the resin. Then, the resin which is hardened is pulled off to obtain a replica 54 as shown in Fig. 5 c . Industrial Applicability According to the present invention as described above, the stamper can be formed directly enabling the production steps to be simplified and the defect rate to be reduced.Further, since use is made of a beam of charged particles such as electron beam or ion beam, the patterns can be formed more finely than those formed by the conventional method of using a laser beam. This is because, the electron beam can be converged more finely than the light beam. Moreover, since the time required for the manufacturing steps is shortened, the time can be greatly shortened to produce the optical disk, to evaluate the signals produced by the optical disk, and to determine the processing conditions. Accordingly, the productivity can be increased. Thus, the present invention can be effectively adapted to a method of producing a stamper for optical disks.
