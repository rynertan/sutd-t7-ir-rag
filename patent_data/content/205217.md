## Description
This invention relates to semiconductor devices including a Schottky barrier and having an improved voltage blocking characteristic, particularly but not exclusively Schottky diodes designed for fast switching and blocking medium or high voltages. Schottky diodes with high breakdown voltages are described in the article of that title by B. M. Wilamowski in Solid State Electronics, Vol. 26, 1983 , No. 5, pages 491 to 493. The disclosed device comprises a semiconductor body a portion of which is of one conductivity type, a metal based layer at a surface of the body and forming an active barrier with said body portion at a plurality of separate areas, and closely spaced field relief regions of opposite conductivity type which form with the body portion a In the Schottky diodes made by B. M. Wilamowski the field relief regions are in the form of a grid of highly doped regions of the opposite conductivity type which were diffused from the surface to have a sheet resistance of approximately 100 ohms per square. This sheet resistance is equivalent to a doping concentration of at least 5 X 10¹⁸cm ³ at the body surface. The metal based layer which was of aluminium in the particular diodes made by Wilamowski forms an ohmic contact with these highly doped field relief regions. These field relief regions act as a screen to lower the electrical field near the Schottky barrier at the surface during reverse bias of the Schottky barrier. As a result, the blocking capability is improved by a reduction of the reverse leakage current, a sharpening of the breakdown characteristic and an increase of the breakdown voltage, e.g. from 43 volts to 135 volts. When the Schottky barrier is forward biased the field relief regions are considered by Wilamowski to be inactive since the forward voltage drop on the Schottky barrier is smaller than the forward voltage drop would be on the It is necessary to enlarge the device area in order to accommodate both the field relief regions and a given area for the Schottky barrier. This increases the junction parasitic capacitance, and so can reduce the switching speed of the device particularly at low voltages. However, experiments conducted by the present applicants on such Schottky diodes having highly doped field relief regions indicate that a significant reduction in the switching speed of this device can also result from minority carrier storage effects as a result of minority carriers injected into the body portion at the The present invention is based on the recognition that when operating at even moderate current densities or with Schottky barriers having a high barrier this According to the present invention there is provided a semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor body a portion of which is of one conductivity type, a metal based layer at a surface of the body and forming an active Schottky barrier with said body portion at a plurality of separate areas, and closely spaced field relief regions of opposite conductivity type which form with the body portion a Because the further Schottky barrier is formed on an opposite conductivity type region to that of the active Schottky barrier, said further Schottky barrier is reverse biased by the applied voltage which forward biases the active Schottky barrier. Therefore, when the active barrier is forward biased, the minority carrier injection into the body portion from the field relief regions is restricted by the leakage current across this rectifying reverse biased further barrier in series with the It should be noted that co pending European patent application 84201865.7 which is published as EP A 0 147 893 after the priority date of the present application also discloses providing field relief regions of Schottky and other unipolar barrier devices with means restricting the flow of minority carriers into the body portion under forward bias of the active barrier. These means disclosed in EP A 0 147 893 involve providing at the area of the field relief regions a layer of different material from that of the body portion and from that of the unipolar barrier forming means. Extra lithographic and processing steps may be needed to provide some of these means disclosed in EP A 0 147 893. In accordance with the present invention the restriction of minority carrier injection by means of the formation of the further Schottky barrier can be achieved by simply using a low doping concentration to form the field relief regions thus, for example, implantation using a low dose of dopant ions may be used to provide the field relief regions in the body in a precisely controllable manner as regards their conductivity type determining dopant concentration. However, if desired, additional processing steps may be used to optimise the Schottky barrier formed with the field relief regions of a device in accordance with the invention. Thus, for example, a recess may be etched at the body surface at least where the further regions are to be contacted by the metal based layer etching such a recess can remove a higher dopant concentration which may be present at the body surface so that the further Schottky barrier is formed with a deeper part of the further region having a lower dopant concentration. It is also possible to provide, at the surface of the field relief regions for example by ion implantation a higher dopant concentration of said one conductivity type as a layer which is thinner than the thickness of the internally generated depletion layer formed at said further Schottky barrier with zero bias and which is depleted thereby, the presence of said depleted dopant layer serving to increase the height of said further Schottky barrier. Particular examples of these and other features in accordance with the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings illustrating, by way of example, a few different embodiments of the invention. In these drawings It should be noted that all the Figures are diagrammatic and not drawn to scale. The relative dimensions and proportions of various parts of these Figures have been shown exaggerated or reduced for the sake of clarity and convenience in the drawing. The same reference signs as used in one Figure are also generally used to refer to corresponding or similar parts in the other embodiments. The semiconductor device of Figure 1 is a high voltage Schottky diode comprising a semiconductor body 10, for example of monocrystalline silicon, a portion 2 of which is of one conductivity type n type in the example shown . A metal based layer 11 is present at the upper major surface of the body 10 and forms a Schottky barrier with the body portion 2 at a plurality of separate areas to constitute the active barrier 3 of the diode. The layer 11 may be of a metal, an alloy or for example a metal silicide. Closely spaced field relief regions 4 of opposite conductivity type p type in the example shown form with the body portion 2 a In accordance with the present invention the The metal based layer 11 contacts the regions 4 and body portion 2 at a window in an insulating layer 34 at the body surface. As illustrated in Figure 1, guard rings 24 may also be provided in the body portion 2 around the contact window. Figure 1 illustrates two such concentric guard rings provided in known manner as It should be noted that the diode of Figure 1 is quite different from those disclosed in the Solid State Electronics article by B. M. Wilamowski. In the Wilamowski diodes the doping concentration of the field relief regions is so high that the difference between the electron work function of the metal layer and the electron affinity of the semiconductor region is overcome by quantum tunnelling of charge carriers to give an effectively ohmic contact at the surface of the field relief regions. Consequently the metal layer in the Wilamowski diodes does not form a rectifying Schottky barrier with the field relief regions. The diode of Figure 1 can be manufactured using known device technologies. Thus, for example, the body portion 2 may be formed by a high resistivity In order to obtain the low dopant concentration of the regions 4 which is required to form the further rectifying Schottky barrier 41, a low dose of boron ions 42 is used for the implantation. Normally for this purpose a boron ion dose of less than 10¹³cm ² is used, for example about 5 x 10¹²cm ² or even less, depending on the extent to which the boron dose is subsequently diffused in the body and on the particular metal chosen for the layer 11. Normally the implantation and diffusion conditions should be chosen such that the final boron concentration at the surface where contacted by the metal layer 11 is less than 5 x 10¹⁶cm ³. A low boron concentration, for example less than 5 x 10¹⁵cm ³ is desirable particularly when the metal layer 11 is such as to normally form a low barrier with In choosing an appropriate barrier height for a particular Schottky diode, there are several major considerations to bear in mind the forward voltage drop increases as the barrier height the reverse leakage current decreases exponentially with increasing barrier height and the speed may decrease with high barrier heights at high barrier operating temperatures due to minority carrier injection from the forward biased Schottky barrier itself. The barrier height of the active barrier 3 is usually chosen to minimise the overall power dissipation, although a compromise is usually necessary since one particular aspect of the device performance e.g. operating temperature, speed, forward current handling capability, or some combination of such requirements may place a limit on the barrier height. Unless other steps are taken to modify the situation, a metal based layer 11 which forms a high Schottky barrier with A low barrier height would normally be chosen for the active barrier 3 in low voltage devices e.g. a Schottky diode with a 10 volt blocking capability , and the high leakage current in these devices can be reduced by providing the field relief means 41 4 44 in accordance with the present invention. In this case, the height of the barrier 41 to the opposite conductivity type field relief regions 4 would be large, and hence the injection from the regions 4 into the body region 2 would be severely restricted by the low leakage current through the The field relief means 41 4 44 may also be used in high voltage Schottky diodes, e.g. for blocking voltages of at least 100 volts or even 200 volts or more. In this case, the barrier height chosen for the Schottky barrier 3 would normally be as high as possible without degrading the speed, e.g. probably at least 0.7eV for a silicon device. This choice would be made in order to give a low leakage current and hence low reverse dissipation which is required for thermal stability during hot operation, e.g. with barrier temperatures of 100 to 150 C. In such a device the requirement of a high barrier to the Thus for a given composition of the metal based layer 11 and a given barrier height for the barrier 3 with the This layer 51 is indicated by a broken line in Figure 2 which illustrates how it may be formed by implantation of, for example, arsenic ions via the windows in the masking layer 40 after the heating step to diffuse the regions 4 to the desired depth. In this case, the arrows 42 in Figure 2 may designate this arsenic ion implantation step to raise the height of the barrier 41. By using the same masking layer 40 for the formation of both the regions 4 and the layer 51, the layer 51 can be confined in a simple manner to the surface of the regions 4 and so does not affect the height of the barrier 3 at the surface of the Since with a region formed using dopant diffusion the dopant concentration reduces with diffusion depth in the body, field relief regions 4 of a desirably low dopant concentration may also be formed by etching away higher doped portions to leave only the lower doped portions. Two such situations are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. In the device of Figure 3, recesses 54 are present at the body surface where the field relief regions 4 are contacted by the metal based layer 11. These recesses 54 remove the more highly doped part of the regions 4 and may be etched at the windows in the masking layer 40 of Figure 2 after diffusing the boron implant to a desired depth for the regions 4. Thus, no additional lithographic step is necessary to define these recesses 54. In the device of Figure 4 a single recess 52 is present at the whole of the surface area where the metal based layer 11 forms the active Schottky barrier 3 with the It will be evident that many modifications are possible within the scope of the present invention. Thus, for example, the height of the active barrier 3 may be increased or decreased by providing a highly doped surface layer within its zero bias depletion layer in accordance with the teaching in GB A 1459231. Instead of a concentric annular configuration for the field relief regions 4 and active barrier areas 3, other geometries, for example a mesh or grid arrangement or polygonal array, may be employed.
