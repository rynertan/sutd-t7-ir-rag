# ELECTRIC CABLE JOINTS

## Abstract
An electric cable joint including a termination comprises at least on inner component 8 heat shrunk onto a cable or on to at least one part of a cable and at least one outer component 10 of resilient material which is an interference fit with the inner components s . The heat shrink component takes up considerable variation in the size of the underlying cable or part thereof so that a range of cable sizes can be accommodated by a much smaller number of inner component sizes than in a purely slip on range.

## Claims
1. An electrical cable joint as defined comprising at least one inner component heat shrunk onto a cable or on to at least one part of the cable and at least one outer component of resilient material which is an interference fit with the inner component s .

## Description
This invention relates to electric cable joints including joints between dis similar conductors, often called terminations , as well as joints between similar conductors, always called joints primarily but not exclusively for screened cables working at voltages in the approximate range from 1 to 35 kV. Three types of joint are in regular use in this range The present invention provides a range of joints which combines the use of slip on and heat shrink techniques to secure the main advantages of each. In accordance with the invention, an electric cable joint as defined comprises at least one inner component heat shrunk onto a cable or onto at least one part of a cable and at least one outer component of resilient material which is an interference fit with the inner component. Usually both the inner component and the outer component will be exposed to the electric field. The inner component should be of significant wall thickness, preferably such that its cross sectional area is at least equal to that of the cable, or cable part s , to which it is appplied. Because the wall thickness of heat shrinkable material normally increases during shrinkage an effect which can be enhanced, if desired, by expanding the material lengthwise as well as radially, through it will then shrink longitudinally to a much larger extent the variation in the outer diameter of the heat shrink inner component can be significantly less than the variation in the diameter of the underlying cable or cable part s , and moreover the larger diameter over the inner component allows a greater absolute tolerance for the fitting of the outer, resilient component. Consequently, there need be no doubt that components of a particular size will fit the cable for which they were designed, regardless of variations within the manufacturing tolerance of the cable, and indeed the same size components may be designed to make a satisfactorily fit on a number of cable sizes. The invention includes a method of making a cable joint as defined comprising applying it least one inner component onto a cable or onto at least one part of a cable by heat shrinking and then applying at least one other component of resilient material by pushing it onto the inner component s to form an interference fit therewith. The inner component may be a simple thick walled sleeve or it may be shaped and or incorporate two or more heat shrinkable materials, depending on its function. For example The outer components s may be of any kind appropriate to the design and purpose of the particular joint. For example, in a single core straight through joint it may be a simple tubular component with an insulating body, a thin tubular semi conductive insert occupying a central zone of the inner surface and a thin semi conductive coating on the whole of its outer surface. In other cases, however, it may incorporate the whole or an outer part of a stress cone or a shed to increase surface leakage path or a tee fitting or an earthing tag or a voltage test terminal connected to the cable conductor via a body of semi conductive material or more than one of these. The invention will be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a joint termination between a single core cable 1 and a threaded post terminal 2. The cable end is prepared in the usual way by cutting back to remove an end portion of the sheath 3 and expose appropriate lengths of the dielectric screen 4, insulation or dielectric 5 and conductor 6. A ring 7 of conductive paint is applied to ensure that there are no conductive sharp edges at the screen end. In accordance with the invention, a thick walled sleeve 8 of insulating heat shrinkable material the inner component is applied and shrunk to enclose nearly all the exposed dielectric screen 4 and an adjacent section of the insulation 5. After securing a spade fitting 9 to the conductor end by crimping or soldering a composite moulding 10 the outer component is pushed into place over the heat shrunk sleeve 8 with which it makes an interference fit a silicone grease is preferably used to facilitate assembly. The moulding 10, made from an ethylene propylene diene terpolymer rubber EPDM incorporates an inner insert 11 of carbon black loaded semi conductive EPDM, which is at conductor potential when the joint is in service and so relieves the space within it from electrical stress and an outer coating 12 of the same semi conductive material, which is maintained at earth potential and serves both to control the distribution of electrical stress in the main insulating body 13 of the moulding and to provide an external safety screen. Electrical continuity from this outer coating 12 to the cable dielectric screen 4 is established in any convenient way, for example by a semi conductive heat shrink sleeve 14, and the joint is completed in a conventional manner by passing the post terminal 2 through the eye of the spade terminal 9, securing it by means of an insulated nut 24 with an epoxy resin body and metal inserts 15, 15 and finally snapping on a cap 16 of insulating EPDM. Figure 2 shows a modification in which the dielectric screen 4 of the cable is stripped back to, and the semi conducting paint 7 applied at, a point nearer the end of the insulation 5 in order to reduce electrical stress adjacent the feather edge of the insulating body 13. The design shown in Figure 3 is also structurally very similar, but in this case the cable screen has been cut back further than in either of the other designs. The heat shrink inner component 8 is positioned so that it only just overlaps the semi conducting paint 7 and it is formed with a tapered end so that it, together with the semi conducting tube 14 which is shrunk over it, forms, in the region 20, a stress cone. In all three cases, the inner heat shrink component 8 may be made either of an ordinary insulating material, preferably with good resistance to tracking, or from a stress grading material of high permitivity. Figure 4 shows one half of a straight through joint between two single core cables. This is otherwise similar to the joint of Figure 1 except that the stress grading sleeve 8 is omitted and instead the moulding 10 is supported on two heat shrunk insulating discs 17, 18. Disc 17 supports an insulating tube 19 which supports part of the semi conductive heat shrink sleeve 14 so as to generate a natural tapered shape which forms a stress cone. Optionally this sleeve 14 is enclosed by an insulating heat shrink sleeve 21. A range of joints of the type shown in Figure 1 is made using throughout a slip on outer component moulding 10 with an internal diameter of 50mm. Four sizes of heat shrinkable inner component sleeve 8 are used as follows
