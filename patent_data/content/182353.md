# Random access memory device formed on a semiconductor substrate having an array of memory cells divided in sub arrays.

## Abstract
A random access memory DRAM device formed on a semiconductor substrate having an array of memory cells MC which are divided in several sub arrays MCA 0 . . 3 . The device has memory blocks each containing one of the subarrays, a word decoder WD0 . .3 and column decoder CD0 . .3 . Each of the memory blocks MC is selected in dependently to perform an access operation and refresh operation. As long as different memory blocks MC are se lected for respective operations, the both operations are performed in paralle, however when the same memory block MC is selected for both operations, namely double selected, a comparison circuit 43 detects the double selec tion and the priority to one of both operations are determin ed and perform the operation selected preferentially. Usu ally, the refresh oriented operation is allowed. However, in order to decrease busy ratio of the device, the refresh ac cess operations is performed preferentially. Further compli cated operation for priority selection, is performed accord ing to a predetermined schedule memorized in a priority providing means 46, 48 . In addition, a common word bus line CWLi is proposed for accessing each memory blocks, namely each sub arrays, in order to reduce common word lines for realizing a further high packing density of the DRAM device. This common bus line is also applicable to other device such as a static RAM.
