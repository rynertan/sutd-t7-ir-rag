## Description
This invention relates to a method of measuring a biological ligand. The ability to measure the concentration in the blood of a drug administered to a patient is an important factor in the treatment of the patient. Moreover, the detection in the blood of trace components derived from various diseases is important in early diagnosis of the diseases in patients. As these medicinal substances and trace components derived from various diseases can be bound to biological ligands, it is important to be able to measure such biological ligands which incorporate medicinal substances and trace substances derived from various diseases. A humoral fluid such as blood contains various components, and some of them are similar to each other in their molecular weights and or physiological properties. For this reason, the measurement of such components requires high specificity and high sensitivity. Furthermore, in order to utilise conventional inspection techniques for diagnosis of a disease, the measuring procedure is of necessity to be simple. Various methods of detecting these trace components in blood have been developed, among which enzyme immunoassay is widely employed because of its superior sensitivity and specificity and its ability to allow rapid treatment of a large number of samples. However, the sensitivity of conventional enzyme immunoassay techniques is not sufficient and it is not easy to obtain an exact measurement of concentration because of the complicated washing procedures that are used and the transferring of tubes. The present inventors have investigated various enzyme immunoassay methods using various combinations of a ligand or an antibody and an enzyme or a material having an enzyme inhibitory activity as follows In the method of EP A 0119767 for measuring a biological ligand, there are brought into contact with each other in aqueous solution a a ligand to be measured, b an enzyme or a covalently coupled combination of an enzyme and a macromolecular substance, and c either a covalently coupled combination of an antibody against the above ligand and an antibody against the above enzyme, or a covalently coupled combination of an antibody against the above ligand, an antibody against the above enzyme and a macromolecular substance, determining the residual activity of the enzyme and utilising the result obtained as a measure of the ligand. In our EP A 0124366, there is disclosed a method of measuring a biological ligand, characterised by bringing into contact with each other in aqueous solution Finally in our EP A 0132292 European Patent Application No.84304093.2 , there is described a method of measuring a biological ligand which comprises bringing into contact with each other in aqueous solution A a ligand 1 to be measured and, B a covalently coupled combination of a biotinyl enzyme inhibitor and a ligand 2 having an antigenic determinant which is also an antigenic determinant of ligand 1 and C an antibody capable of reacting with the said antigenic determinant, adding a biotinyl enzyme, measuring the residual biotinyl enzyme activity and utilising the measurement thereby obtained as a measure of the biological ligand. It is an object of this invention to provide a yet further method of measuring a biological ligand, which possesses high sensitivity and simplicity of operation. This invention is based on the discovery that when a covalently coupled combination of an enzyme capable of acting on a water insoluble macromolecular substance and a ligand or an antibody is employed as the covalently coupled combination of substances and brought into contact with the ligand to be measured, the ligand in a test sample can be detected to a high degree of sensitivity and the operation is relatively simple to carry out. According to the present invention, there is thus provided a method of measuring a biological ligand which comprises, bringing into contact with each other in aqueous solution A a ligand 1 to be measured and B either a covalently coupled combination 1 of an antibody against the ligand 1 and an enzyme capable of acting on a water insoluble macromolecular substrate or a covalently coupled combination 2 of a said enzyme and a ligand 2 having an antigenic determinant which is an antigenic determinant of said ligand 1 , which covalently coupled combination 2 is present in the aqueous medium together with a said antibody, said antibody reacting c with said ligand 1 or b with said ligand 1 and with said ligand 2 to which said enzyme is covalently coupled digesting with said enzyme C a said water insoluble macromolecular substrate, determining the residual activity of the enzyme after it has acted on said macromolecular substrate and utilising the measurement thereby obtained as a measure of the biological ligand. The subject to be measured by the method of the invention is termed herein ligand 1 . The ligand 1 will be a substance having one or more antigenic determinants, and includes, for example, hormones derived from various endocrine glands, plasma proteins such as immunoglobulin, albumin and ferritin, viral antigens such as HB antigen, bacteria, α fetoprotein, and carcinoembryonic antigens. This ligand 1 may also be a hapten or may be a first antibody in the double antibody method. The ligand 1 may furthermore be the conjugate of the antigen to be measured and a first antibody as in the double antibody method. The fluid medium acting as the source of ligand 1 may be The ligand 2 which is optionally used will also have one or more antigenic determinants and at least one antigenic determinant must be an antigenic determinant of the ligand 1 . All the antigenic determinants of ligand 2 may be antigenic determinants of ligand 1 , and accordingly, ligand 2 may be identical with the ligand 1 . The antibody which is used should be the antibody against this common antigenic determinant when two ligands are present in the aqueous medium being used. The antibody whether or not a ligand 2 is used may include fragments of immunoglobulin such as F ab ₂, Fab and Fab. Such an antibody may be produced by following any suitable method for producing an antibody. For example, the ligand 1 , the ligand 2 or a covalently coupled combination of either of these ligands and a protein material is injected once or several times into the subcutaneous region of the back, foot pad or femoral muscle of a warm blooded animal such as a rabbit, goat, horse, guinea pig or chicken, in an amount of from 0.3 to 2 mg per kg together with an adjuvant to produce the antibody in a humoral fluid such as serum. This humoral fluid may be used as it is as the antibody, although, the antibody is preferably separated by following a conventional immunoglobulin isolation method. Alternatively, the antibody may be produced as a monoclonal antibody. In this case, one of the above antigens is injected several times into the abdominal cavity of a mouse together with an adjuvant, and the spleen of the mouse is excised. The spleen cell is fused with a mouse myeloma cell by a conventional method involving the use of polyethylene glycol. The hybridoma thus obtained is cultured and cloned, and the cell which is capable of producing the desired antibody is obtained. This cell is injected into the abdominal cavity of a mouse, and multiplied. Then, ascites are collected, and the desired antibody is separated from the ascites. Should the antibody not be covalently coupled combined with the enzyme, as will be described hereinafter and should the enzyme activity not vary appreciably through the reaction of the antibody with the ligand 2 portion of the covalently coupled combination which is also described hereinafter, a macromolecular compound may preferably be bound to the antibody prior to use. Preferred macromolecular compounds for this purpose are water soluble, and their molecular weights are greater than 100,000 daltons. Examples of such macromolecular compounds include polysaccharides and their derivatives such as soluble dextran, carboxymethyl dextran, dextran with induced amino group and amylose, proteins such as gelatin, hemocyanin and ferritin, and polyethylene glycol The macromolecular compound may be covalently coupled to the antibody by one of the coupling methods described hereinafter. The enzyme is able to act on a water insoluble macromolecular substrate C . Enzymes whose activities are easily measured are preferably used. Examples of such enzymes include α amylase, cellulase, collagenase, mannase, protease, elastase and lipase. The enzyme is initially covalently coupled with the antibody or the ligand 2 . When it is covalently coupled with the antibody, ligand 2 is not used. On the other hand, when it is covalently coupled with ligand 2 , the antibody may be used in its natural form or covalently coupled with a macromolecular compound. The method of covalently coupling the enzyme and the antibody or the ligand 2 may be selected in accordance with the functional groups of substances to be combined. Such functional groups include, amino groups, carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups, imidazole groups and phenyl groups. The coupling of amino groups may be carried out by many methods such as the diisocyanate method, the glutaraldehyde method, the difluorobenzene method, and the benzoquinone method. When coupling an amino group and a carboxyl group, it is possible to use the peptide binding method using a carboxyl group coupled to a succinimido ester and the carbodiimide method or to use Woodward reagent. The periodate oxidation method Nakane method where a bridge is formed between amino groups and sugar chains may also be utilised. When using a thiol group for the aforesaid binding, a carboxyl group may be first converted to a succinimido ester group, and this ester group is then allowed to react with cysteine to introduce the thiol group thereof. The two thiol groups are then linked by using a thiol reactive bifunctional cross linking reagent such as phenylene bismaleimide. Typical of methods utilising a phenyl group are the diazotization method and the alkylation method. In addition to the foregoing methods, it is possible to use a suitable method selected from the various methods described in Methods in Immunology and Immunochemistry C.A. Williams et al., 1976, Academic Press N.Y. . and Koso Meneki Sokutei ho E. Ishikawa et al., 1978, Igaku shoin Japan . The molar ratio of components used in forming the covalently coupled combination is not limited to 1 1, and other suitable ratios can be easily selected. After the coupling reaction, the covalently coupled combination produced is purified by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography,and lyophilized, if desired. When the enzyme is covalently coupled with the antibody, the antibody thus combined is then brought into contact with the ligand 1 to be measured. When the enzyme is covalently coupled with the ligand 2 , the antibody is first brought into contact with the ligand 1 and the ligand 2 in its covalently coupled combination with the enzyme. In the latter case, the order of contacting is not limited, and either the ligand 1 or the covalently coupled combination of enzyme and ligand 2 may first be allowed to contact the antibody. Of course, both ligand 1 and the covalently coupled combination of enzyme and ligand 2 may be allowed to contact the antibody at the same time. The temperature of the aqueous solution is usually kept at from 20 to 45 If the antibody is not covalently coupled with the enzyme and if the enzyme activity has been found not to vary appreciably through the reaction of the antibody with the ligand 2 portion of the covalently coupled combination of enzyme and ligand 2 , a second antibody may be reacted with the antibody covalently coupled to the ligand 2 portion. The second antibody may be prepared by following the method previously described herein. Subsequently, the ligand 1 , the covalently coupled combination of substances and, when appropriate, antibody are brought into contact in an aqueous medium with a water insoluble macromolecular C . The covalently coupled combination may initially be in the reaction solution to which the water insoluble macromolecular substance is added or it may also be separate from the reaction solution, too. The macromolecular C is then subjected to the action of the enzyme, and it is usually a conventional substrate for the enzyme. The macromolecular substance is characterised by its being insoluble in water. Hence the interacting of the macromolecular substance and the enzyme portion of the covalently coupled combination thereof with ligand s and antibody is carried out at the boundary between solid and solution, and as a result, steric hindrance of macromolecule s bound to the enzyme is a major factor. This steric hindrance is supported by an experiment which has been carried out wherein a pentose and an insoluble starch were digested by an α amylase which was in its natural form or which had previously been allowed to combine with a macromolecule. The results of the experiment showed that the enzyme activity was scarcely lowered by the covalent coupling of the enzyme with the macromolecule when the substrate was pentose, while it was considerably lowered when the substrate was the insoluble starch. Macromolecular substance enzyme pairings which can be used include insoluble starches in the case of α amylase, celluloses in the case of cellulase, collagen in the case of collagenase, mannan in the case of mannase, insoluble proteins in the case of proteases, elastin in the case of elastase, and various lipids in the case of lipases. When a macromolecular substance is normally water soluble, it may also be used in the method of this invention if it has been subjected to insolubilisation. The insolubilisation may be carried out by covalent coupling with an insoluble carrier material or by subjecting the macromolecular substance to homopolymerization. The conditions under which the enzyme reaction will be carried out will depend on the enzyme being employed. After the reaction, the residual magnitude of the activity of the enzyme prior to its acting on the macromolecular substance will be determined by detecting changes in the reaction mixture, such as the concentration of a decomposition product or the decrease in the substrate for the enzyme. The method of this invention enables a biological ligand to be detected and determined in high sensitivity and in high specificity. The operation of this method is simple, and a biological ligand can easily and inexpensively be determined. There are essentially no restrictions on the ligand to be measured, although the present method is especially suitable for use when measuring ligands having relatively high molecular weights. When using a covalently coupled combination of the antibody and enzyme, since the ligand is used only as the antigen which is necessary to produce the antibody, the amount of the ligand present may be very small. Accordingly, this method is effective when only a small amount of the ligand can be obtained and when the ligand is extremely expensive. The following Examples illustrate this invention 5 mg of α amylase were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 M carbonate buffer solution of pH 8.0. 100µl of 20 µg ml 3 carboxytheophylline succinimido ester DMF solution were added to this, and allowed to react at ambient temperature for 1 hour. Gel filtration using a Sephadex G 25 column which had previously been equilibrated with 20 mM phosphate buffered saline solution of pH 6.5 containing 20 mM calcium chloride was carried out, and the void fractions were collected. The fractions were concentrated to 1 ml to obtain an enzyme ligand covalently coupled combination of theophylline and α amylase. 50 µl of 800 mg ml of this covalently coupled combination solution were added to 50 µl of serum, and in order to inhibit human serum amylase, 50 µl of 500 µg ml anti human amylase goat IgG were added to the mixture. 50 µl of 15 µg ml anti theophylline mouse IgG was also then added, and allowed to react at 37
