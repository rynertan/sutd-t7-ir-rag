# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MODE CHANGES AND OR TOUCH MOUSE CONTROL

## Abstract
A method and device for instituting mode changes 78 or precise relative cursor 13 positioning is taught. Briefly stated, an operator who is interfacing with a CRT 10 or display area 12 which has a touch input device 51 on it, such as a switch matrix or infrared light beam matrix, may institute a number of changes simply by inserting two or more noncontiguous styli 18,18 , such as two fingers, into the touch input area. This would, therefore, change the mode of information which is presented by the display to the op erator 16 or the information presented to a computer or interface via the display area by the operator. In the preferred embodiment, the insertion of two noncontiguous fingers would allow the cursor 13 to be moved in a speed and direction which is directly related to the speed and direction of a finger with the result that the cursor need not be disposed directly under the finger which might otherwise block an operator s view and thereby allow more precise positioning of the cursor.
