## Description
Automatic, program.rlable, machine for cutting flexible mat erial transversely respite the cutting of flexible material formed into rolls, such as single or sandwich type plastic foam, fabrics or sheets of plastic, being a very commonplace operation, it is one that presents difficulties, especially for small firms, since it either has to be done manually, at a low output and with the use of a lot of labour, or else by the machines currently available on the market that are designed to cut the material in large quantities and, generally, are very expensive.The object of the invention is, therefore, to provide an automatic, programmable, machine for cutting transversely flexible material formed into rolls, the cost of which is limited in comparison with the efficiency achievable there with.Another object of the invention is to enable the cutting length to be programmed and to be precise.These and other objects too are all attained with the machine in question for cutting transversely flexible material formed into rolls, characterized by the fact that it comprises at least one unwinding unit of cradle or V conformation that contains the material to be cut and is provided with an electronic circuit for programming the unwinding of the material at least one rotating disc unit, placed above the material to be cut and provided both with a traversing and a cutting drive synchronized with the progrange for the unwinding of the material so as to automatically cut the latter into pieces of the required length t least one trams, placed downstream of the cutting unit, for t removal of the cut pieces, this having a belt driven in synchrony with the unwinding of the material and at least one bench for amassing the cut pieces, variable in position with respect to the removal frame and set up to stack the cut pieces one on top of the other since it can be synchronized with the exiting of the pieces from the removal frame.It is obvious frown the foregoing that with the cutting machine in question high productivity is achieved since it is fully automatic and the presence of the electronic programming circuit, in combination with an incremental angular transducer encoder allows, as will be made clear in the ensuing text, the cutting length which, furthermore, is extremely precise, to be programmed in an exact manner.In addition, it is possible for the cut pieces to be counter ed and to be stacked in an orderly fashion.The various parts of the drive mechanism can, furthermore, all be synchronized through the said electronic programming circuit so as to give the cutting machine maximum overall efficiency.Further characteristics and advantages of the cutting machine according to the invention will become more apparent from the detailed description that follows, illustrated purely as an unlimited example on the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 shows, in an axonometric view, the cutting ma chine forming the subject of the invention Figure 2 shows, again in an axonometric view, the trans verse cutting unit of the machine depicted in Figure 1. lith reference to the above mentioned figures, the cutting machine in question is constituted by a nunber of separate A stations, in such a way as to facilitate also the transportation of the complete assembly.The said stations consist of a unit A for unwinding the material E that is wound around itself to form a roll a transverse cutting unit B a frame C for the removal of the cut pieces and a bench for amassing and stacking the cut pieces, not illustrated but only described herein.In particular, the unwinding unit A is of cradle or V conformation, so as to keep the material E evermore in position whilst being unwound.The said unit comprises a supporting frame 1 on which is placed, going from the entry point to that where the cut pieces exit, a feed roller 2, a middle or central roller 5, placed lower down than the roller 2, a roller 24 placed at the same height as the roller 2, downstream of the roller 24, and a discharge roller 6 that is operated by a geared motor 7 via a transmission chain 50. All the aforementioned rollers are positioned parallel to one another.Two sets of unwinding belts, 3 and 4, respectively, encompass, one set intercalated with the other, the rollers 2 and 5, and the rollers 5 and 6, respectively.Along the lower bifurcations, the belts 3 and 4 are guided, at least in the region of the rollers, by needle bearings in a comb configuration, while the upper bifurcations are able to slide on suitable underneath supporting surfaces.Neither the guide combs nor the supporting surfaces have been illustrated, so as to simplify and render more clear the other characteristics of the cutting machine.The roller 6 thus carries all the other rollers in rotation. rnhe roller 24 is a supplenentary roller whose purpose is to cause the material B. to be straightened and orientated before it arrives at the cutting unit B.Another supplementary roller is constituted by a roller 8 that can be adjusted in height or be placed simply resting on the roller 6, the task of this being to guide the material E, to ensure that the direction of this be cor rect and to prevent displacements thereof at the time the cutting operation is in progress.The unit B is provided with a movable transverse cutting assembly, comprising a movement device 12 that enables a cutting disc 13 to traverse, in both directions, along two fixed guides 16 and 16 that support the material E and are in contrast with the cutting disc 13. Trore particularly, the cutting unit B has an upper frame 14 of portal conformation, and this carries a cable 15, wound in the form of a helical spring, that supplies the electricity to the cutting unit.The frame 14 is provided, furthermore, with a fixed beam 10, supported by a pair of stanchions 11, on the upper part 10 of which slides, resting thereon, a friction wheel 35 that has a high friction coefficient and is operated by a reduction unit connected to a motor, the former 34 and the latter 33 together constituting the aforementioned movement device 12.The motor 33 also actuates an electric motor 31 that drives the cutting disc 13.The complete cutting unit comprising the motor 33, the reducer 34 and the friction wheel 35, as well as the elec tric motor 31 and the cutting disc 13, is carried by a support 30 that is displaced with the movement device 12.The said cutting unit is guided by the rollers 36 and 36 that are pivotally integral with the support 30 and rest on the upper edge of a fixed section 37 integral with the beam 10.On to the rollers 36 and 36 is discharged the part of the overall weight that it is not wished to apply to the friction wheel 35. The latter ensures the operation being silent and makes certain the stoppage of the machine should unexpected obstacles be encountered along the cutting path.A runner 38, fixed to the supports of the rollers 36 and 36 at a height above these, acts as a linear cam in respect of a pair of microswitches 39 that are mounted on the upper edge of the section 37 in a way whereby suitable ad justments may be made to the spacing of one from the other in keeping with the width of the material to be cut the purpose of this being, to cause, in the two directions, the cutting unit to be brought to a halt. The frame C for the removal of the cut pieces, located downstream of the cutting unit 3, is provided with a frame 20 that comprises a belt 21 mounted in an endless fashion around a roller 22 operated, through a chain 51,byte geared motor 7, and around an end roller 23.In place of the removal frame C, or downstream thereof, the aforementioned bench for amassing and stacking the cut pieces can be placed.It is most important that note should be taken of the fact that the autocratic cutting machine is provided with ar el ectronic circuit for programming at least the unwinding of the material B. The said electronic circuit comprises an angular transducer encoder 9 which, in the case under consideration, is connected to the discharge roller 6 of the unwinding unit A and.counts the revolutions and the angles made by this the said transducer then supplies the electronic circuit with the data needed to achieve an overall synchronization of the movements and, in particular, to stop the unwinding compatibly with a cut off length that is predetermined and can be programmed using, for example, a digital counter.The microswitches 39 are also interlocked to the said electronic circuit and to the data provided by the transducer 9 and only upon completion of the infeeding of a fresh piece to be cut do they give the consent to the cutting unit to operate, in the reverse direction to the previous one, and thus to proceed with another cutting operation.The said tossing bench can be fixed, in either a flat or a cradle conformation, at a lower level than the removal frame C, with the possibility existing to position it suitably in accordance with the length of the cut pieces.Alternatively, it can be constituted by a carriage that can be positioned and is provided with a transverse bar able to amass the cut pieces thereon. It can also be constituted by a carriage able to stack the cut pieces with an automatic reciprocating movement, that can be linked to and rendered synchronous with the exit of the cut pieces. As stated previously, the removal frame C can also be dir ectly substituted by the amassing bench which, in such a case, would be constituted by an inclined platform having terminal stop means. The cutting machine forming the subject of the invention can also be connected operationally to other units able to carry out, for example, longitudinal slitting operations on the material 2, as well as shearing or other operations upstream or dosrmstream of the transverse cutting operation, without in any way deviating from the framework of protect ion afforded to the invention as described above and claimed below.
