# Bendable circuit board and load cell using it.

## Abstract
A wiring circuit board 103 comprises a flexible board having a wiring pattern formed thereon. Portions 201a, 201a of the wiring pattern which are crossed by a predeter mined bending line of the board are so formed, adjacent to the bending line as to enable such portions if broken when the board is bent about the line to be mended simply by sol dering across that line. Such an arrangement can facilitate connections and repairs in wiring circuits such as those of load cells.
