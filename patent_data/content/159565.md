S. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 255 5514, 1980 . Even before its chemical identification, PAF has been linked to various biologic activities and pathways making it one of the important mediators responsible for a variety of physiological process including activation or coagulation of platelets, pathogenesis of immune complex deposition, smooth muscle contraction, inflammation as well as respiratory, cardiovascular and intravascular alterations.These physiological processes are known to be associated with e large group of diseases, for example, inlfammatory diseases, cardiovascular disorders, asthma, lung edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. It is therefore only natural that more and more scientific investigators are focusing their work on the search of a PAF antagonist or inhibitor for the treatment and or the prevention of these common diseases. The compounds of the present invention are potent and specific PAF antagonists. They belong to the class of neolignan compounds related to piperenone, a known insect antifeeding substance, and 5 allyl 2 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl 3a,a methoxy 3 methyl2,3,3a,6 tetrahydro 6 oxobenzofuran, the subject matter of copending application Serial No. 541,806, filed October 13, 1983 our Case 17003 . Both piperenone and the 5 allyl compound mentioned above were isolated from the Chinese herbal plant Piper futokadzsura Sieb. See K. Matsui et al., Agr. Biol.Chem. 40, 1045 1976 ibid, 40, 1113 1976 andMatsui et al., Tetrahedron Letters 24, 1905 1975 .Although the plant has been used in Chinese herb medicine for the treatment of arthritis conditions, no one had successfully isolated nor identified the active substance until our work on the 5 allyl compound and the compounds of the present invention.We found these compounds are potent and specificPAF antagonists useful not only in the treatment of arthritic conditions but also for other diseases including asthma, hypertension, lung edema, adult distress syndrome and the like. Accordingly, it is the object of tht present invention to provide a class of novel compounds as specific PAF antagonists. Another object of this invention is to provide processes for the preparation of thesePAF antagonists. A further object of this invention is to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable composition containing these novel compounds as the active ingredient for the treatment of diseases which are subject to the mediation of a PAF. Still a further object of this invention is to provide a method of treatment comprising the administration of a therapeutically sufficient amount of one or more of the PAF antagonists to a patient suffering from various skeletal muscular disorders including but not limited to inflammation, e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout allergic disorders hypertension cardiovascular disorder asthma lung edema skin diseases psoriasis or adult respiratory distress syndrome.

The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3 butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic monoor diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. A compound of I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the anti inflammatory agents are employed. Dosage levels of the order from about 1 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above indicated conditions from about 50 mg to about 5 gms. per patient per day . For example, inflammation is effectively treated and anti pyretic and analgesic activity manifested by the administration from about 25 to about 75 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day about 75 mg to about 3.75 gms per patient per day . Advantageously, from about 5 mg to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per daily dosage produces highly effective results about 250 mg to about 2.5 gm per patient per day . The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 5 mg to 5 gm of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 25 mg to about 500 mg of active ingredient. It will be understood, t wever, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.
