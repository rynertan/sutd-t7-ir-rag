# Potassium fluorrichterite glass ceramic and method.

## Abstract
A highly crystalline glass ceramic article exhibiting superi or toughness against fracture propagation, a modulus of rup ture in excess of 1,370 bar, a predominant crystal phase of potassium fluorrichterite, and having an overall composition consists essentially of Canasite may be a secondary phase, but a crystal phase composed essentially of potassium fluorrichterite is preferred for dinnerware.
