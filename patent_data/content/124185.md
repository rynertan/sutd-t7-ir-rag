# Hydraulic press for compacting drums containing radio active waste.

## Abstract
A hydraulic press for compacting drums containing ra dio active waste. The press consists essentially of a press table, a set of vertical support pillars connected at the top to a hydraulic cylinder with a ram mounted therein, and of a pressure jacket hydraulically movable in the vertical direc tion between the ram and the press table along the support pillars. According to the invention, the lower end of the ram is provided with an annular chamber in which the pressure jacket is receivable in a retracted position.
