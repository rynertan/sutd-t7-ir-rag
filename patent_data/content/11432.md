# Carrier for remote controller.

## Abstract
The invention provides a carrier 74 for an apparatus that must be moved to different positions relative to a work station including a track 22 mounted to the work station and a truck 24 assembly with a locking brake 36 riding the track. A mounting head which receives the apparatus is cou pled to the truck by an arm. The mounting head 28 rotates relative to the arm 26 and includes a locking brake to pre vent rotation. A single control handle 20 simultaneously releases the mounting head and truck assembly to permit normal relocation and reorientation of the apparatus with respect to the work station and for convenient access to the apparatus. Releasing the control handle causes both locking brakes to engage, thereby fixing the apparatus in the desired position and orientation.
