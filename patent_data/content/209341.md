# Corrosion resistant amorphous cromium metalloid alloy compositions.

## Abstract
Amorphous chromium metalloid alloys exhibiting corro sion resistance in acid environments are described. The alloys contain a relatively low amount of a metalloid selected from the group of B, C, P, N, S, Sb and As. Additional metalloid elements such as Al, Si and Ge may also be present to enhance other pro perties of the amorphous alloy.
