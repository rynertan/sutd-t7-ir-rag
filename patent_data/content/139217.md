# Electromagnetic printing group for dot matrix printer.

## Abstract
Electromagnetic printing group for dot matrix printer where the armature movement towards the rest position is damped by a counterarmature 22 interposed between the armature 6 and a resilient element 20 defining the rest position so that the air cushion interposed between counter armature 22 and armature 6 provides a first damping action followed by the damping caused by the ballistic impact between armature and counterarmature and finally by the resilient damping of the residual energy of the armature 6 and counterarmature 22 caused by the resilient element dissipation.
