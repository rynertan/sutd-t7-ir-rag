# Monopolar electrolytic cell of the filter press type.

## Abstract
An electrolytic cell of the filter press type comprising a monopolar cell unit having a plurality of substantially vertical alternating anodes and cathodes each anode being partitioned from the adjacent cathode or cathodes by a separator to form in the cell unit a plurality of anode and cathode compartments, the electrolytic cell comprising two or more such units mounted one above the other, the anodes 3 of the cell unit at the top 6 or bottom 1 being attached to electrical conductors 8 , the cathodes 2 of the cell unit at the bottom 1 or top 6 being at tached to electrical conductors 7 , and the anodes and cathodes of adjacent cell units which are not attached to the said conductors being connected by means of a bipolar electrical connection or connections between the anodes of one cell unit and the cathodes of the adjacent cell unit positioned above or below the said cell unit.
