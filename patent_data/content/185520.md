# Polymerization catalyst, production and use.

## Abstract
A vanadium containing catalyst component useful for the polymerization of olefins to polyolefins having a high molecular weight and a broad molecular weight distribution comprising polymerizing the polyolefins in the presence of a catalyst comprising A a vanadium containing catalyst com ponent obtained by contacting an inert support material with a dihydrocarbyl magnesium compound, optionally an oxygen containing compound, a vanadium compound, a Group III metal halide, and B an aluminium alkyl cocatalyst.
