# Novel dihydropyridines.

## Abstract
New compounds useful as therapeutical agent and useful as intermediates for the preparation of other therapeutically active dihydropyridines. which new compounds are of the formula CHEM wherein R 1 is one or two the same or different substituents on the phenyl ring selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, NO2, CN, CF3, Cl and Br A is a straight or branched alkylene group with 2 5 carbon atoms R 2 is CHEM wherein B is a straight or branched alkylene group with 2 5 carbon atoms and R 3 and R 6 are the same or different and each represents a straight or branched alkyl group with 1 5 carbon atoms, an alkylaryl group or both together are part of a 5 7membered heterocyclic ring R 4 is a straight or branched alkyl group with 1 5 carbon atoms in which alkyl group the carbon chain is interrupted by an oxygen atom R 5 is a lower alkyl group, or a physiologically acceptable salt or optical isomer thereof, processes for the preparation of said compounds pharmaceutical preparations containing said compounds, a method for their therapeutical use and a new process using said compounds as intermediates.
