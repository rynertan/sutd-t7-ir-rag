# MODULATOR AND DEMODULATOR FOR OPERATION WITH AMPLITUDE AND PHASE KEYED MODULATION SIGNALS

## Abstract
A demodulator for demodulating a received signal which has been modulated in accordance with a modulation scheme which falls within the class of APK modulation uses a phase locked loop PLL to recover the carrier. A ROM 20 in the demodulator provides information in both sweeped and locked modes of operation of the PLL to control the PLL. The ROM 20 also provides at its output the digital data which has been encoded at the modulator in accordance with the selected APK scheme. The information stored in the ROM is uniquely determined by the signal points associated the selected scheme. A modulator com patible with the demodulator is also disclosed herein.
