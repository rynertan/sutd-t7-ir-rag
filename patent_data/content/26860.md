## Description
Process for producing silicon tetrachloriae and reaction mass for use in such process.The present invention relates to an improved process for producing silicon tetrachloride.Silicon tetrachloride SiCl4 is produces by passing chlorine gas through a packed porous mass or reactor be containing a silicon bearing material, The silicon bearing material may be any one of a number of materials such as for example silicon metal, silicon carbide, ferrosilicon 90 Si , silica plus carbon ana certain metal silicides.In the present day commercial production of SiC14, it is generally preferred to employ silicon carbide as the reactant because of its availability and low cost. How ever, the use of silicon carbide in this process is not without its limitations. For instance, the reaction between chlorine and silicon carbide forms a carbonceous ash as a by product which builds up and eventually clogs the pores of the reactor bed, When this ilanpens, tne chlorine gas begins to channel through the bed without reacting with the silicon carbide.It has also been found that certain mpuriWies in the silicon carbide such as calcium react with chlorine to produce calcium chloride which deposits near the top of the reactor bed and forms a crusted layer of reactant.This crust prevents further additions of the reactant SiC from moving down into the packed bed. The result is that the reactor must be frequently shut down in order to remove the crust.Crusting of the top of the SiC bed also can occur by the formation of acicular crystals of silicon which intergrow to form a relatively strong network between the SiC grains. This phenomenon happens when various silicon chlorides. are formed in the reaction between chlorine and silicon carbide which subsequentLy decompose in the cooler parts of the reactor to form Si and SiC4. It is also known in the art that the reaction between silicon metal and chlorine to produce silicon tetrachloride is exothermic and therefore requires adequate cooling of the reactor vessel in order to maintain the temperature of the vessel walls at or below a safe limit.So far as is presently know, silicon metal has been used only by itself as the sole reactant in the processes of the prior art.An object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the production of silicon tetrachloride by passing chlorine gas through a packed parous reactor bed containing silicon carbide as a reactant, Another object of the present invention is to provide such an improved process which eliminates the problems of chlorine channeling and crust formation on top of the reaactor bed.Still another object is to provide such an improved process which is capable for producing large yields of silicon tetrachloride.The above and the other related objects and advantages of the present invention are attainea by the addition of silicon metal to the packed porous reactor bed containing silicon carbide as a reactant. It has been surprisingly found in accordance with the present invention that the addition of silicon metal in amounts such that about 15 to 85 by weight of the total combined silicon in the reactor bed is silicon metal, significantly greater quantities of SiCl4 can be produced than are possible when silicon carbide is used alone as the reactant and without any noticeable increase in reaction temperatures.The sole figure in the accompanying drawing is a schematic elevational view of a typical packed porous bed reactor for producing silicon tetrachloride.Referring to the drawing, the reactor includes a metal vessel 10 containing a packed porous bed 12 composed of particles of silicon carbide. Chlorine gas is passed through the porous bed 12 via a series of jet ports 14 in the bottom wall of the vessel 10. Silicon tetrachloride that is formed by reaction between the chlorine gas and silicon carbide collects within the top of the vessel 10 and is fed along with any unreactel chlorine via pipes 16, 18 to a sludge trap and product tank not shown , Additional SiC is periodically fed into the vessel 10 through a charging port 20 on the top of pipe 16.Carbonaceous ash that is formed as a by product of the reaction collects in a layer 22 at the bottom of the vessel 10, Vessel 10 is further provided with dis charge ports 24 for removing the ash in a continuous or batch type operation.Typically in operation of the reactor using SiC., the pores of the packed bed 12 eventually become clogged with carbonaceous ash formed in situ. As a result, the chlorine gas begins to channel through the packed bed 12 without reacting with the SiC, Additionally, impurities that are present in the SiC such as calcium react with the chlorine gas to produce Cacti2. This CaCl2 is deposited near the top of the bed and eventually forms a crusted layer of reactant 26. The. crusted layer 26 prevents further additions of SiC to the reactor from moving down into the packed bed and therefore operation of the reactor must be periodically stopped in order to remove the layer via the discharge ports 24.It has been found in accordance with the present invention that the problem of chlorine gas channeling and crust formation can be effectively overcome by the addition of silicon metal in amounts such that about 15 to 85 by weight of the total combined silicon in the reactor bed is silicon metal. Furthermore, it has. been unexpectedly found that these problems are obviated by the addition of silicon metal without at the same time causing any sudden exethermic rise in reaction temperature. It is postulated that since less silicon carbide is used as a reactant, there is a sign√¨ficant reduction in the quantity of carbonaceous ash that is formed as a by product and consequently there is less pore clogging in the reactor bed.Also, since less silicon carbide is employed, there are fewer impurities such as calcium introduced into the reaction and this significantly minimizes the tendency for crust formation. Crusting on top of the reactor bed by the formation of acicular crystals of silicon also is minimized by the addition of the silicon metal to the reactor bed.It should. be noted in regard to the above that if the silicon metal is added in amounts that result in less than about 15 . by weight of silicon in the reactor bed, then significant amounts of carbonaceous ash may begin to form which can clog the pores of the bed while on the other hand if the addition of silicon metal results in more than about 85 by weight of the silicon metal, then the reaction temperature may begin to rise abruptly to the point where the vessel walls might approach or even exceed a safe temperature limit. It should also be noted that the addition of silicon metal to the SiC reactor bed without any sudden exothermic rise in temperature makes it possible to produce greater yields of silicon tetrachloride. The reason for this result of course is that more silicon metal is available for reaction with chlorine in the reactor bed.in the practice of the present invention, the silicon metal may be added to the silicon carbide reactant either before or while the silicon carbide is being introduced into the reaction vessel. In any event, it is extremely important that the two ingredients are uniformly blended together since otherwise any concentration af the silicon metal in the packed bed is likely to result in a hot spot in the vessel wall,The particle size of both the silicon metal and silicon carbide materials is not too marrowly critical.It is sufficient for example to employ silicon metal in a particle size range of between about 0,0017 inch and 2 inches corresponding range in metric units 0,0432 mm and 50,8 mm , the lower limit being equal to about 325 mesh M . A corresponding size distribution for theSiC particles is also preferably employed in order to obtain as uniformly mixed a reactor bed as possible.Typically, the SiCl4 reactor used in the practice of the present invention is made of mild steel and is water cooled on the outside with weirs mounted on the top The reactor may employ either a moving or stationary porous packed bed, The reactor is approximately 1,5 m in diame ter at the bottom, tapering off to about 0,9 m in diameter at the top. The height of the reactor can vary from about 1,8 to 3,0 m. The chlorine feed rate will usually vary from about 1,8 to 3,7 kg Cl2 per minute.In one example of the present invention, 127 kg of metallurgical grade silicon metal i.e., containing up to about 1 iron and 400 kg of silicon carbide were fed to a SiC14 reactor of substantially the same construction described above, This initial charge was prepared by blending 18 kg of silicon metal 25,4 mm x 32 M with 18 kg of powdered silicon carbide i.e., less than about 6,35 mm particle size to a bag. These were fed alternatively one bag SiC followed with one bag of the 50 mixture. Three 41 kg bags and four 36 kg bags of SiC were fed along with seven 41 kg bags of 50 mixture. When the reactor was back on stream, chlorine was fed at the rate of approximately 2,3 kg per minute.Thirteen hours later, the reactor was opened and charged with 163 kg SiC plus 544 kg silicon metal. Again, one bag of SiC was alternated with one bag of to 50 mixture.Two tests were conducted to determine the effect on the production of SiC14 of mixing silicon metal with silicon carbide to form a packed bed. In the first test, the temperature of the reactor wall was monitored at various locations to determine whether the use of silicon metal in the packed bed would significantly raise the reactor wall temperature. However, no detectable rise in temperature was found when using a mixture of 40 silicon metal with SiC, i.e., Si Metal Wt. Si Metal Wt.Si Metal 0,7 Wt. SiC . It was postulated from this test that hot spots on the reactor wall would not occur so long as the silicon metal was uniformly blended with the silicon carbide.In the second test, two similar reactors were used at the same time over a five day period. One contained onlySiC while the other contained a mixture of Si metal lump and SiC powder such that about 49 of the total contained silicon in the bed was as silicon metal. The result of this test are shown in Table I. The five day average yield of SiCl4 from the reactor which contained on the average 49 Si metal was 77,8 while that from the reactor which contained 100 SiC was 65,2 . Both reactors were operated simultaneously in the same manner.The increase yield of SiCl4 when using blends of Si metal and SiC is thought to result from 1 fewer reactor shut downs to break up crust on the bed, 2 reduction of Cl2 channeling in the bed and 3 the larger silicon content per unit volume of the bed compared to 100 SiC.
