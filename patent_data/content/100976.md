# Radiation image reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A radiation image reproducing apparatus reads a radia tion image 22 out of a first recording medium 24, 240 and reproduces it on a second recording medium 100 as a visible image 102 . Input devices 18, 20 of the apparatus enter input data which are associated with a method of exposing an object to a radiation and objects exposed part. In response to the input data, a processing condition determining unit 12, 17 determines conditions optimum for a graduation processing and a spatial frequency processing. A processor system 10, 12 is provided for reading the radiation image stored in the first recording medium 24, 240 and processing the radiation image on the basis of conditions which the processing condition determining unit 12, 17 determines in response to the input data associated with the radiation image.
