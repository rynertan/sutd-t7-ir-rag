## Description
Light sensitive silver halide color photographic materialThis invention relates to a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material in which the utilization of a photographic coupler is improved in order to enable the formation of a high dye image.The dye image on the light sensitive silver halide color photographic material is generally formed by a coupling reaction of a photographic coupler with an oxidized form of a color developing agent produced in reducing, to a silver image, a silver halide latent image which has been formed by exposing the light sensitive material. With regard to the aforesaid photographic coupler hereinafter referred to simply as a coupler , there are known the so called four equivalent coupler which requires four atoms of silver to form one molecule of a dye and the so called two equivalent coupler which requires only two atoms of silver.In the light sensitive color photographic material, there should exist coupler molecules corresponding to dye molecules, which is required to provide its maximum density, per unit area of the silver halide emulsion and silver halide molecules corresponding to a numerical value obtained by multiplying the amount of the coupler by the equivalent number of the coupler. As described in, for example, T. H. James, Theory of Photographic Process , Chap. 12, Sec. II, Macmillan Co., Ltd. 1977 , however, the above mentioned oxidized form of a color developing agent is involved in a variety of reactions with other additives, in addition to the reaction with the coupler.Therefore, all of the oxidized form of a color developing agent is not utilized to form a color developing dye. For this reason, it is generally necessary that the concentration of the coupler is adjusted to obtain a maximum density of the dye from a certain amount of the silver halide and that the equivalent concentration of the coupler relative to the silver halide is set in accordance with its usage. In the case of a color photographic paper, for example, the amount of the used coupler with respect to the silver halide is generally set to 50 to 70 by equivalent.Under such conditions, a percentage of a portion to be exhausted for the formation of the dye image with respect to the total amount of the oxidized form of the color developing agent which is produced in color developing hereinafter referred to as a coloring efficiency and a percentage of a portion to be exhausted for the formation of the dye image with respect to the total amount of the used coupler hereinafter referred to as a coupler utilization efficiency are merely 45 to 65 and 50 to 95 , respectively.Particularly, in cases where 2 pyrazoline 5 one type magenta coupler among the couplers is employed, the coloring efficiency and the coupler utilization efficiency thereof are as low as 40 to 50 and 50 to 60 , respectively.An object of this invention is thus to provide a lightsensitive silver halide color photographic material having an improved and enhanced coloring efficiency and coupler utilization efficiency. As a result of repeated researches by the inventors of this invention, it have been found that the aforesaid object can be achieved by a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material comprising a support and at least one light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer applied thereon and containing a photographic coupler which reacts with an oxidized form of a color developing agent to form a dye, in which the silver halide included in the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer is composed of a silver halide substantially free from iodine, and grains of the silver halide are distributed therein in a monodisperse state satisfying the following formula I and are included therein in a proportion of 5 x 1011 grains m2 or more, preferably 1.0 x 1012 or more, and the photographic coupler is included in the lightsensitive silver halide emulsion layer so that the amount of the photographic coupler may be 3.5 x 10 15 gram equivalent or less per grain of said silver halide S r 0.15 I EMI3.1 wherein ri is the qrain diameter of the i th grains, and ni is the number of the i th grains.Effects of the light sensitive silver halide color photographic material according to this invention can be obtained by enhancing the supply source density of an oxidized form of a color developing agent relative to the coupler and by distributing, in a monodisperse state, the silver halide grains in the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer to uniformize the concentration of the oxidized form of the color developing agent.This invention will be further described in detail as follows In the light sensitive silver halide color photographic material according to this invention, a silver halide substantially free from iodine is employed as the silver halide grains included in the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer hereinafter referred to simply as a silver halide emulsion layer . Therefore, the silver halide which is referred to in this invention means a silver halide including neither, for example, silver iodobromide nor i1ver chloroiodobromide which are however useful in other photographic arts.In this invention, effective is the silver halide emulsion layer where the grains of the silver halide free from iodine are distributed in a monodisperse state satisfying formula I described above and where the silver halide grains are included in the emulsion layer in a proportion of 5 x 10 grains m2 or more.It can be supposed that the effects of this invention may be achieved even by using a multi disperse emulsion having a wide grain diameter distribution, but when such a multidisperse silver halide emulsion including 5 x 1011 silver halide grains m2 or more and a coupler are practically employed, the effects of this invention cannot be accomplished even under the same addition conditions as in this invention.Reasons for this fact, though not necessarily definite, may be presumed as follows Being different in induction period before the start of the development br in a developing speed after the start of the develo pment from each other of the respective silver halide grains, even when exposure is given thereto in an amount necessary for the acquisition of a maximum density, and many silver halide grains being present which do not contribute to the formation of a dye image even under exposure.In consequence, the more uniform the size of the used silver halide grains, the more greater the effect of this invention become, and it is preferred that the grains of the silver halide have such a diameter destribution as defined particularly by formula I below The silver halide grains according to this invention are those where a numerical value obtained by dividing their standard deviation S by their average grain diameter r is 0.15 or less EMI5.1 More preferably, the S r value is not more than 0.10. The average grain diameter here referred to means an average diameter of the silver halide grains if they are spherical. When the grains are cubic or in a shape other than the sphere, their projected image is converted into a circular image having the same area, and an average diameter of the circular image is taken as the average grain diameter. When the diameter of an individual silver halide grain is represented with ri and the number of the grains is represented with ni, the average grain diameter r can be defined by the following formula EMI5.2 The measurement of the aforesaid grain diameter can be carried out, for the above purpose, by any of various processes which are usable in the art. Typical processes are described in Love land, Analytical Method of GrainDiameter A.S.T.M.Symposium on Light Microscopy, p. 94 122 1955 and Miece and James, Theory of PhotographicProcess , Edit. III, Macmillan Co., Ltd., Chap. 2 1966 .The grain diameter may be measured by use of a projected area or a diametrical approximate value of the grain.When the grains are substantially uniform in shape, the grain diameter distribution can be represented fairly accurately by the diameter or projected area thereof.The grain diameter distribution may be determined according to the manner which is described in Tribery and Smith, Experiential Relation between Sensitometry Distribution and Grain Diameter Distribution , The PhotographicJournal, Vol. LXXIX, p. 330 338 1949 .The silver halide grains used in the light sensitive silver halide color photographic material according to this invention may be of the so called twinned crystal having an irregular shape such as sphere or plate, or may have a regular shape such as cube, octahedron or tetra decahedron. Further, it is also possible to employ a mixture of such irregular and regular grains.The light sensitive silver halide color photographic material according to this invention comprises a coupler in an amount of 3.5 x 10 15 gram equivalent or less, preferably in an amount of 2.0 x 10 15 gram equivalent per grain of the silver halide used in this invention The gram equivalent just mentioned of the coupler is here represented with 1 2 mole in connection with a twoequivalent coupler and with 1 4 mole in connection with a four equivalent coupler.The total amount of the coupler in the silver halide emulsion layer, which has a color sensitivity to each wave length region, of the light sensitive color photographic material according to this invention may be the amount which can provide a maximum density required for a dye image.The amount of the coupler varies depending upon the usage of the light sensitive color material in which the silver halide emulsion layer is incorporated, therefore any particular limitation is not made on the amount, but it is needless and wasteful to add the coupler in a stoichiometric amount or more. However, in order to heighten the coloring efficiency of the coupler, the amount of the coupler is preferably near to the stoichiometric amount. For example, it is preferred that a two equivalent coupler is used in an amount of 0.25 to 0.5 mole and a four equivalent coupler in an amount of 0.125 to 0.25 mole.The silver halide emulsion layer used in this invention means a unit emulsion layer having a sensitivity to a light of a specific wavelength and having an ability to form a specific dye image as described above, but the unit layer may compose plural emulsion layers. In such a layer constitution, the number of the silver halide grains in each layer of the plural layers constituting the unit layer, and the total concentration of the coupler therein should satisfy the aforesaid requirements of this invention. As the silver halide emulsion which is comprised in the silver halide emulsion layer according to this invention, an emulsion of silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver bromide or the like is preferably employed which is excellent in developability, but, for example, a silver iodobromide emulsion is difficult to obtain the effects of this invention.The silver halide grains for the silver halide emulsion used in this invention may be prepared by means of any of the acid process, the neutral process and the ammonia process. Further, a method is also acceptable in which seed grains are prepared in the acid process and are caused to grow up to a desired size in the ammonia process by which a growth rate is accelerated. For the growth of the silver halide grains, it is preferred that pH and pAg of the material in a reactor are controlled and the respective amounts of silver ions and halide ions are simultaneously added thereto in succession corresponding to the growth rate of the silver halide grains, as described in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No.48521 1979.The silver halide in this invention may be chemically sensitized with an active gelation a sulphur sensitizer such as allylthiocarbamide, thiourea or cystine a selenium sensitizer a reduction sensitizer such as tin II salt, thiourea dioxide or polyamine a noble metal sensitizer such as a gold sensitizer, for example, potassium aurithiocyanate, potassium chloroaurate, 2 aurothio 3 methylbenzothiazolium chloride or a sensitizer of a water soluble salt of ruthenium, palladium, platinum rhodium or iridium or the like, for example, ammonium chloropalladate, potassium chloroplatinate or sodium chloropalladate some of these serve as sensitizers or fog restrainers, depending on the amount .These sensitizers may be used alone or in combination thereof for example, a combination of the gold sensitizer and the sulfur sensitizer, or a combination of the gold sensitizer and selenium sensitizer .As mentioned above, the silver halide emulsion layer used in this invention comprises the unit layer having the sensitivity to a light in a specific wavelength region, but the light sensitive silver halide color photographic material according to this invention may comprise three of the above mentioned unit layers which are independently sensitive to different wavelength regions. These light sensitive layers may have separately a light sensitivity to wavelength regions of, for example, 400 to 500 nm, 500 to 600 nm and 600 to 700 nm, respectively, and the layers are called a blue sensitive emulsion layer, a green sensitive emulsion layer and a red sensitive emulsion layer, respectively.In this invention, an optical sensitization of each silver halide emulsion layer to a desired wavelength region can be accomplished by use of an optical sensitizer, for example, a cyanine dye such as zeromethine dye, monomethine dye, dimethine dye or trimethine dye, or a merocyanine dye in single or in combination thereof for example, a supercolor sensitization .In the thus optically sensitized silver halide emulsion layer according to this invention, there may be included a compound which reacts with an oxidized form of a color developing agent to form a dye, i.e. a coupler.In this invention, a yellow coupler, a magenta coupler and a cyan coupler which are heretofore known may be adopted as the aforesaid coupler. Examples of the preferred couplers include a acylacetanilide yellow coupler, 5pyrazolone magenta coupler, pyrazolinobenzoimidazole magenta coupler, pyrazolotriazole magenta coupler, indazolone magenta coupler, phenol cyan coupler and naphthol cyan coupler. As the coupler to be used, any type of a two equivalent coupler, a four equivalent coupler or a polymeric coupler is acceptable. If the selected coupler is soluble in an alkali, it may be used in the form of an alkaline solution, and if it is soluble in an oil, it is preferred that the same is dissolved and dispersed in a high boiling solvent, and is added to the silver halide emulsion, in accordance with the procedure described in U.S. Patents Nos. 2,322,027, 2,801,170, 2,801,171, 2,272,191 and 2,304,940. In this case, it is also possible to additionally add any other coupler, a hydroquinone derivative, an ultraviolet ray absorber, a discoloration preventing agent or the like, if desired.A mixture of two or more couplers may also be employed.Examples of the aforesaid high boiling solvents include di n butyl phthalate, tri cresyl phosphate, dioctyl phthalate and n nonyl phenol, and as the low boiling solvents there are known, for example, methyl acetate, butyl propionate, cyclohexanol and diethylene glycol monoacetate. These solvents may be used alone or in a combination thereof. The coupler which is thus dissolved in the solvent may be mixed with an aqueous solution containing a hydrophilic binder such as gelatin and an anionic surface active agent such as alkylbenzenesulfonate or alkylnaphthalenesulfonate and or a nonionic surface active agent such as sorbitan monolaurate. The resultant mixture may be then emulsified in a colloid mill, a supersonic dispersing unit or the like, and may be added to the silver halide emulsion.Further, the aforementioned coupler may be dispersed in the photosensitive material in accordance with a latex dispersing method. This latex dispersing method and its effects are described in Japanese Provisional PatentPublications Nos. 74538 1974, 59943 1976 and 32552 1979, and Research Disclosure , No. 14850, p. 77 79 August, 1976 .Examples of suitable latexes include homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers of monomers such as styrene, ethyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, n butyl methacrylate, 2 acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate, 2 methacryloyloxy ethyltrimethylammonium sulfate, sodium 3 methacryloyloxy propane l sulfonate, N isopropylacrylamide, N 2 2 methyl 4 oxopentyl acrylamide and 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulfonate.In the light sensitive silver halide color photographic material according to this invention, a combination of the silver halide emulsion layer and the coupler may be set so that the color sensitivity of the emulsion layer and the color of the coloring dye formed with the aid of the coupler which is added to the emulsion layer may lie in the relation of a complementary color, as in the case of the ordinary light sensitive silver halide color photographic material. Further, the layer and the coupler may take a false color system such as a combination of the magenta coupler and the blue sensitive emulsion layer, the yellow coupler and the green sensitive emulsion layer, or the cyan coupler and the red sensitive emulsion layer.Constitutions of other layers regarding the light sensitive color photographic material according to this invention or emulsion layers for the constitutions are described in Research Disclosure, Vol. 176, No. 17643 Vol. 184, No. 18431 Vol. 187, No. 18716 and elsewhere.For the purpose of preventing the dye from discoloration due to active rays having a short wavelength, it is advantageous to use ultraviolet ray absorbers such as thiazolidone, benzotriazole and benzophenone compounds together with the coupler in this invention. Particularly, an alone or an additional employment of Tinuvin available from Ciba Geigy AG is effective.The hydroquinone derivatives used together with the coupler also include their precursors. Examples of the discoloration preventing agents used together with the coupler include chroman, coumaran and spirochroman compounds and the like.The light sensitive color photographic material according to this invention can form a color image thereon by means of an ordinary color development process after exposure.The basic processes in the negative positive method include the color development, bleaching and fixing processes. These basic processes can be conducted differently in an independent manner or simultaneously in one step by the use of a processing solution having these functions, instead of two or more treating steps. As examples of the one step methods, there are a combined color processing method of using a processing solution containing a color developing agent, a ferric salt as a bleaching constituent and a thiosulfate as a fixing constituent, and a combined bleach fix method of using a processing solution containing an iron III complex of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as a bleaching constituent and a thiosulfate as a fixing constituent.No restriction is particularly put on the processing method of the light sensitive color photographic material according to this invention, and any method is applicable in this invention. As typical examples of the methods, there are a method comprising color development, bleachfix, if necessary, washing and stabilization a method comprising color development, bleaching, fixing, if necessary, washing and stabilization a method comprising pre hardening, neutralization, color development, stopping and fixing, washing, bleaching, fixing, washing, posthardening and washing a method comprising color development, washing, subsidiary color development, stopping, bleaching, fixing, washing and stabilization a method comprising halogenation bleaching of the developed silver generated by color development, color development again to increase the amount of a formed dye.The color developing agent used to treat the lightsensitive color material according to this invention is an aqueous alkaline solution including the developing agent and at pH 8 or more, preferably at pH 9 to 12. An aromatic primary amine developing agent eligible as the above developing agent means a compound having a primary amino group on the aromatic ring and further having an ability to develop the exposed silver halide, or a precursor for forming such a compound. As the aforementioned developing agents, p phenylenediamines are typical, and preferred examples of them include 4 amino N,N diethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N,N diethylaniline, 4 amino N ethyl N ss hydroxyethylaniline, 3 methy1 4 amino N ethy1 N hydroxyethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N ss methanesulfonamidoethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N methoxyethyl 4 amino N ,N diethylaniline, 3 methoxy 4 amino N ethyl N ss hydroxy ethylaniline, 3 methoxy 4 amino N ethyl N ss methoxyethyl aniline, 3 acetamido 4 amino N,N diethylaniline, 4 aminoN,N dimethylaniline, N ethyl N ss ss ss methoxyethoxy ethoxy ethyl 3 methyl 4 aminoaniline, N ethyl N ss ss methoxyethoxy ethyl 3 methyl 4 aminoaniline, and their salts such as sulfate, hydrochloride, sulfite, p toluenesulfonate and the like.In Japanese Provisional Patent Publications Nos. 64932 1973, 131526 1975, 95849 1976 and Bent et al., Journal of theAmerican Chemical Society , Vol. 73, p. 3100 3125 1951 , typical examples of the developing agents are also enumerated. The amount of the aromatic primary amino compound to be used depends on a desired activity level of the developing solution, but in order to elevate the activity, the amount of the compound should be increased. It is generally used in an amount ranging from 0.0002 mole liter to 0.7 mole liter. Further, the compounds may be used in a combination of several kinds thereof in accordance with a use.The combinations of the compounds are optionally made in compliance with their uses, but there are, for example, a combination of 3 methyl 4 amino N,N diethylaniline and 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N methansulfonamidoethylaniline, and a combination of 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N ss methansulfonamidoethylaniline and 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N ss hydroxyethylaniline. The color developing solution used in this invention may further contain optionally a variety of components which are usually added thereto, for example, an alkali agent such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, an alkali metal sulfite, an alkali metal bisulfite, an alkali metal thiocyanate, an alkali metal halide, benzyl alcohol, a water softening agent, a thickening agent and a development accelerator.As additives to be added to the color developing solution, in addition to the just mentioned substances, there are compounds for a quick processing solution, for example, bromides such as potassium bromide and ammonium bromide, alkali iodide, nitrobenzoimidazole, mercaptobenzoimidazole, 5 methylbenzotriazole and l phenyl 5 mercaptotetrazole, stain preventing agents, sludge preventing agents, preservatives, interlayer effect accelerators, chelating agents and the like.As bleaching agents in the bleaching solutions or in the bleach fix baths, there are known substances in which metal ions of iron, cobalt, copper and the like are coordinated with organic acids of aminopolycarboxylic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid and the like. Typical examples of the aminopolycarboxylic acids mentioned above include Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, propylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, iminodiacetic acid, ethyletherdiaminetetraacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetrapropionic acid, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, pentasodium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, and sodium nitrilotriacetate. The bleaching solution may contain a variety of additives together with the aforesaid bleaching agent. When the bleach fix bath is employed in the bleaching process, there may be applied a solution containing, besides the bleaching agent, a silver halide fixing agent of a thiosulfate, a thiocyanate, a thiourea or the like.Further, the bleach fix bath may contain a halide such as potassium bromide. Furthermore, as in the case of the aforementioned bleaching solution, there may be contained, in the bleach fix bath, a variety of additives, for example, a pH buffering agent, a brightening agent, an anti foaming agent, a surface active agent, a preservative, a chelating agent, a stabilizer, an organic solvent and the like.The silver halide fixing agents used in this invention are compounds, as used in a usual fixing treatment, for forming water soluble silver salts through the reaction with silver halides, which compounds include, for example, sodium thiosulfate, ammonium thiosulfate, potassium thiocyanate, sodium thiocyanate, thioureas and thioethers.The fixing solution comprising the aforementioned component may be incorporated with a variety of additives, as required, for example, a pH buffering agent such as boric acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, acetic acid, sodium acetate or the like, in a single or a combined form of two or more kinds thereof.In addition to the aforesaid additives, the fixing solution may contain, for example, a brightening agent, an antifoaming agent, a surface active agent, a preservative, a chelating agent, a stabilizer, an organic solvent and the like, and if desired, a conventional fixing accelerator may be further added thereto at will.This invention will be described with reference to the following examples. It is to be understood, however, that these examples only typify this invention and are not to be regarded as limiting in any way.EXAMPLE 1Monodisperse emulsions 1, 3 and 5 containing cubic silver halide grains which were set forth in Table 1 were prepared according to a control rouble process while pAg was maintained at 5.0. To each emulsion were added 50 mg of a sensitizing dye compound A defined below and 10 mg of a stabilizer compound B defined below per mole of silver, and then were further added 5 mg of sodium thiosulfate and 40 mg of potassium thiocyanate per mole of silver, and the resultant mixture was ripened at 500C for 100 minutes to prepare a green sensitive silver chlorobromide emulsion.Next, separately from the above, 2.5 g of a magenta coupler compound C defined below was dissolved in a mixed solution of 2.5 mQ of dibutyl phthalate and 7.5 m of ethyl acetate under heating conditions at 600C, and the resultant solution was added to 70 m of an aqueous solution at 40 C which contains 3.5 g of gelatin and 0.25 g of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and the mixture was then vigorously stirred and dispersed by means of a homogenizer to prepare an emulsified dispersion of the coupler.The thus obtained emulsified dispersion of the coupler was added to the already prepared green sensitive silver chlorobromide emulsion, and 10 m of a 3 methanol solution of l,3,5 triacryloyl hexahydroS triazine was then added thereto as a hardening agent. The resultant mixture had its last pH adjusted to 6.2, afld was applied to polyester bases in such a way that the amounts of the silver, the gelatin and the magenta coupler were 0.3 g m2, 1.7 g m2 and 0.41 g m2 80 of the stoichiometric amount , respectively, in order to obtain samples 1, 3 and 5. Sensitizing dye compound A EMI17.1 Stabilizer compound B EMI17.2 Magenta coupler compound C EMI17.3 Further, a mixture previously prepared by mixing an aqueous gelatin solution with an excessive halide was introduced into a reactor maintained at 600C in a gravity drop manner to obtain poly disperse emulsions 2, 4 and 6 which were set forth in Table 1 below. Similarly to the above, there were added, to the obtained respective emulsions, the sensitizing dye, the stabilizer, the sodium thiosulfate and the potassium thiocyanate, followed by ripening to prepare the green sensitive silver chlorobromide emulsionThe same emulsified dispersion of the coupler and hardening agent solution as mentioned above were mixed with each of emulsions 2, 4 and 6 above, and the resultant mixture had its last pH adjusted to 6.2 and was applied to polyester bases in such a way that the amounts of the silver, the gelatin and the magenta coupler were 0.3 g m2, 1.7 g m2 and 0.41 g m2 80 of the stoichiometric amount , respectively, in order to prepare samples 2, 4 and 6.

Instead of the sensitizing dye, a yellow coupler compound D defined below was added to each of the four emulsions, and application was carried out in all the same manner as in Example 1 so that amounts of the silver, the gelatin and the yellow coupler may be 0.3 g m2, 1.7 g m2 and 0.885 g m2 80 of stoichiometric amount , respectively, in order to prepare samples 7, 8, 9 and 10.Each sample above was exposed to a blue light through an optical wedge and was subjected to the same treatments as in Example 1, and the amount of the developed silver and the density of the yellow dye image at a maximum density portion on each sample were measured. Results obtained are set forth in TABLE 4 below.

On the contrary, in the case of sample 7 which satisfies the requirements of this invention except that the silver iodobromide emulsion is used, the increase in the coloring efficiency is not so noticeable, and the developing speed is also lagging, as compared with sample 9 according to this invention, it is therefore definite that sample 7 is poor in the coupler utilization efficiency. Further, as for samples 8 and 10 unconcerned with this invention which satisfy no requirements of this invention, the coupler utilization efficiency is lower, as seen from the results in TABLE 4.EXAMPLE 3The same procedure as in Example 1 was repeated to prepare cubic silver chlorobromide emulsions 70 of Br and 30 of C1 which were different in average grain diameter, as exhibited in TABLE 5 below. Afterward, samples 11 to 15 were prepared following the manner ofExample 1, except that a sensitizing dye compound E defined below and a cyan coupler compound F defined below were added to each emulsion, and in such a way that the application amount of the gelatin was 1.7 g m2, and the application amounts of the silver and the cyan coupler were set as shown in TABLE 6 below.Each sample thus prepared was exposed to a red light through an optical wedge and was then subjected to the same treatments as in Example 1.
