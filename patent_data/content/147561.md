# SCINTILLATION CRYSTAL FOR A RADIATION DETECTOR AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE SAME

## Abstract
A scintillation crystal and a method for producing same are provided for a radiation detector. According to a first embodiment the crystal comprises a first layer 22 22 of a crystal material having relatively poor mechanical properties and a high energy resolution, and a second layer 24 24 of a crystal material having relatively good mechanical and optical properties. Both layers are arranged on top of each other. Preferably a third layer 26 is provided, and the first layer 22, 22 is arranged in sandwich form between the second and third layer. In a second embodiment, a scintilla tion layer 22 is evaporated on an elastic intermediate layer 18 29b which is provided on a substrate 18 29b . In a third embodiment, a substrate 29c having an uneven or grooved surface 60 is provided, and a scintillation layer 22c is evaporated on said surface 60 . In a fourth embodiment, a freely supported scintillation layer 22d is applied. This layer 22d is sandwiched between two protective layers 24, 26 one of which is coupled to a glass plate 18 via an elastic light coupling medium 27 .
