# An ink jet printer and method of operating such a printer.

## Abstract
An ink jet printer includes a print head means 64 which generates two parallel rows of jet drop streams. Charge elec trodes 76 are mounted on a pair of charge electrode plates 72 which are movable into and out of drop charging posi tions. A pair of catchers 78 each have a drop catching sur face 80 and a drop ingesting slot 82 along the lower edge of the drop catching surface. Each of the catchers is mounted for pivotal movement about an axis parallel to the rows of jet drop streams. The catchers may be pivoted from a drop catching position, in which the drop catching surfaces 80 are substantially parallel, to a full catch position Fig. 2a in which the drop catching surfaces are inclined to face upwardly and intercept the jet drop streams. In the full catch position, the drop ingesting slots 82 are positioned closely together. A link age arrangement is provided for pivoting the catchers from the full catch position to the drop catch position after start up of the print head. The linkage arrangement also moves the charge electrode plates into the drop charging positions after the catchers are pivoted sufficiently to apply a drop deflecting potential thereto, but whilst the drop catching surfa ces intercept the jet drop streams.
