# FINE PARTICULATE FEED SYSTEM FOR FLUIDIZED BED FURNACE

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for feeding solids into the bed of a fluidized bed furnace 18 . The feed solids are separated into a fine fraction and a coarse fraction. The coarse fraction is supplied to fluidized bed 16 in an in bed pneumatic transport feed system or in an over the bed feed system. The fine fraction as well as fluidizing air are supplied to fines admission zone 24 wherein the fine fraction and fluidizing air are thoroughly mixed. The mixture of the fine fraction of feed solids and the fluidizing air is then passed upwardly through air distribution means 38 into fluidized bed 16 .
