# A PROCESS FOR MAKING A SKINNED FOAM

## Abstract
In the manufacture of skinned foam, the viscosities of the melts from which the skin as well as the foam are matched so that both flow uniformly to a die or mold space. Viscosity matching includes the addition of blowing agents, so that such agents are present in all of the layers of the ultimately formed structure. To prevent foaming of the skin layers, nucleating agent is not added to the skin melts and the temperature is controlled so as to prevent homogeneous nucleation in the absence of nucleating agent. More specifically, the skins are kept above the boiling point of the blowing agent at atmospheric pressure and melt temperature, but below the temperature at which homogeneous nu cleation occurs. Skinned foam produced in this way is extrudable in sheet or tube form and can be molded by injection or blow molding techniques.
