# Multifunction processability testing method.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring properties of a viscoelastic material comprises in combination, two opposed dies e.g. 75 adapted to contain therebetween a sample of the material to be tested, means biasing the dies towards each other to apply pressure on the sample, means controlling the temperatures of the dies, means to rotate one of the dies with respect to the other and means to measure the force required for such rotation as applied torque or reaction torque, wherein each of the dies has at least one discon tinuous annular protrusion 95, 96 extending therefrom towards the other arranged so that when the dies are biased together an annular protrusion from one die overlaps an annular protrusion from the opposing die. The method of the invention uses different frequencies of oscillatory rotation at different temperatures.
