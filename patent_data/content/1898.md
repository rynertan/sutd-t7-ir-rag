# A method for producing a heat sealable, biaxially orientated, thermoplastic film laminate.

## Abstract
Laminar thermoplastic films are provided which exhibit improved heat seal stengths as well as heat seal temperature ranges. The laminates comprise a predominantly propylene based polymer substrate or core, the propylene core layer being coated with continous skins, the skins being fabricated from ethylene based resin with a density of less than 0.939.
