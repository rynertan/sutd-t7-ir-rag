# IMPACT RESISTANT RESINOUS COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD OF MAKING

## Abstract
The impact resistance of elastomer modified polymers such as high impact polystyrene, in which the maximum volume average particle size of the elastomer particles is about one micron, is improved by adding thereto a minor proportion of a similar elastomer modified polymer in which the volume average particle size of the elastomer particles is in the range of about 3 10 microns. The amounts of the two blends are chosen so that the number average particle size of said elastomer particles remains substantially the same.
