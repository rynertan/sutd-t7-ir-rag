# Improvements in and relating to apparatus for administering intravenous drugs.

## Abstract
Apparatus for administering intravenously a drug supplied initially in powdery form, in particular cytotoxic drugs, said apparatus comprising a sealed container 22 for the drug, an infusion set 2 to 20 supplying a drip feed of intravenous liquid to the patient and also being in communication with the interior of said sealed container 22 , and a piston cylinder pump assembly 26, 28, 30 also in communication with the interior of said container 22 in such a manner that appropriate actuation of the pump assembly can first of all draw intravenous liquid from the infusion set 2 to 20 into the container 22 to dissolve the drug into solution 64 and thereafter can feed a controlled volume of said solution 64 from the container 22 to the patient. The apparatus thereby provides a closed circuit for the drug which can be administered without removing from the circuit any component containing or transporting the drug. The apparatus can be made opaque thereby avoiding photodegradation of photosensitive drugs.
