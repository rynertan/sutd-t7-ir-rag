# Paper making machine fabric.

## Abstract
A paper making machine fabric used at the wet end of the machine is woven in a five shed pattern repeated over five wefts, the top face of the fabric comprising single weft knuckles and single and double warp knuckles and the bottom face of the fabric comprising single warp knuckles and single and double weft knuckles. The fabric may be made of a synthetic material, e.g. a polyester, which is stretched in the warp wise direction while being heated so as to increase the crimping in the wefts and reduce the crimping in the warps.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A paper making machine fabric woven in a five shed pattern repeated over five wefts, one face of the fabric comprising single weft knuckles and single and double warp knuckles and the other face of the fabric comprising single warp knuckles and single and double weft knuckles. 2. A paper making machine fabric according to claim 1, wherein the fabric is made of a synthetic material and is stretched in the warp wise direction while being heated so as to increase the crimping in the wefts and reduce the crimping in the warps. 3. A paper making machine fabric according to claim 2, wherein the synthetic material is a polyester.

## Description
PAPER KING MACHINE FABRIC DESCRIPTION This invention relates to improvements in paper making and particularly in the woven fabric from which is formed the endless belt onto which is applied a fibre water slurry at the wet end of a paper making machine. It is known that problems occur in the manufacture of fine quality papers and that these problems are normally associated with t wo factors, one being wire marking and the other being a condition known as linting or fluffing .Wire marking is the impression which the knuckles of the wire or fabric make in the sheet of paper and linting is the condition where fibres on the wire side of the sheet are loose and come off during the printing process, causing problems in printing quality. The reason that linting problems are experienced with fabrics and not metal wires is due to the weave construction on the top surface of the wire. In a 3 shed metal wire the topside of the wire consists of cross direction weft floats, which provide support to the sheet and are positioned such that the longest distance to be bridged by the fibres is the length of one hole. In a standard 4 shed or 5 shed fabric the topside consists of machine direction warp floats which present a surface to the sheet which has long machine direction valleys, into which the fibres can fall. The longest distance to be bridged in this case is the length of three holes plus the diameter of two wefts. When the formed sheet of paper is removed from the fabrid this disturbs those fibres which had fallen into the valleys thus causing them to become loose.This theory of fibre bridging is explained in more detail in the article by T Helle, entitled How forming fabric design affects drainage and release , in the trade journal PULP BR PAPER CANADA, Volume 79, No. 11 November 1978 on pp.T 329 333. An object of this invention is to obviate or mitigate these problems. According to the invention there is provided a papermaking machine fabric woven in a five shed pattern repeated over five wefts, one face of the fabric comprising single weft knuckles and single and double warp knuckles and the other face of the fabric comprising single warp knuckles and single and double weft knuckles. An example of the weave is shown in the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows warp and weft knuckles on the face of the fabric on to which it is intended to apply the fibre water slurry and Fig. 2 is a cross section through the fabric. The fabric may be made of a synthetic material, e.g.a polyester. In order to increase the stability of the fabric in the warp wise or machine direction the fabric is stretched in this direction while being heated. The resultant fabric has more crimping in the wefts 1 and less crimping in the warps 2. The face of the fabric on which .it is intended to apply the fibre water slurry comprises single weft knuckles and single and double warp knuckles in a broken twill pattern. The weft and warp knuckles are substantially monoplanar which gives a very acceptable mark to the paper produced. Furthermore, the longest valleys between adjacent warps is the length of two holes plus the diameter of one weft. This has the advantage of minimal disturbance of the fibres which have fallen into the valley, when the formed paper is removed from the fabric. On the other hand, the opposite face of the fabric comprises single warp knuckles and prominent single and double weft knuckles which will take the wear in use. One specification of the weave for producing high quality writing and printing papers consists of 30 warps cm 22 wefts cm 0.20 warp dia. mm 0.20 weft dia. mm. Another specification of the weave for producing unbleached kraft papers of 23 warps cm 18 wefts cm 0.25 warp dia. mm 0.30 weft dia. mm.
