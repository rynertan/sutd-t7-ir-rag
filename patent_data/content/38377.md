# Process for the synthesis of ortho cresol, 2,6 xylenol and 2,3,6 trimethyl phenol.

## Abstract
Phenol is methylated over an alumina catalyst using methanol, and the reaction product therefrom is combined with additional methanol over a promoted magnesium oxide catalyst. Major reaction products are ortho cresol, 2,6 xylenol and 2,3,6 trimethylphenol. The promoted magnesium oxide catalyst contains metal promoters selected from the group consisting of titanium, chromium, and uranium together with sulfate ions.
