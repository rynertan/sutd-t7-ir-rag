# Slaked lime, process for its production, and its use.

## Abstract
Slaked lime calcium hydroxide obtained a process comprising contacting quicklime calcium oxide with an aqueous solution containing at least one anion selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br and NOâ‚ƒ ions in a concentra tion of about 0.1 to about 5 mole liter at a temperature of about 10 C to about 65 C Magnesium hydroxide can be produced by reacting the aforesaid slaked lime with magne sium chloride or magnesium nitrate in an aqueous medium, the amount slaked lime being about 0.5 to about 0.95 equivalent per equivalent of the magnesium compound, and thereafter heat treating the reaction product in an aqueous medium at a temperature of about 150 C to about 250 C.
