# ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC PHOTOSENSITIVE MATERIAL

## Abstract
An electrophotographic photosensitive material is pro vided, which has a photosensitive layer formed on an elec troconductive substrate and containing a polymeric binder and an organic photoconductor. The organic photoconduc tor is expressed by the formula In the formula R¹ and R² may form a pyrazolone ring to gether with C N N , and, if they do not, then R² and R³ may form part of a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring structure with the carbon atom to which they are attached. X may be one of a number of groups containing the radical , , N , N C , NHN NHN C or where R¹ and R² form a pyra zolone ring, also In the above meanings of X, A is oxygen or sulfur and m is 0 or 1.
