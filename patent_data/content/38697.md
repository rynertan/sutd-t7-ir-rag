## Description
SEMICONDUCTOR IMAGE SENSORField of the Invention The present invention relates generally to a solid state image sensor, and more particularly to a semiconductor image sensor which is capable of non destructive readout of optical information, has a wide dynamic range, high sensitivity and low noise and exhibits excellent resolution in terms of space and time. Further, the invention pertains to a method for operating such a semiconductor image sensor.Description of the Prior Art Solid state image sensors are roughly divided into the CCD and the MOS type. In the CCD image sensor, signal charges are stored in a potential well induced by an electric field in a semiconductor region beneath an MOS capacitor electrode, and their readout is accomplished by multiple transfers through such induced potential wells to an output circuitry. But in the MOS image sensor, the signal charge is collected by a photodiode formed by diffusion or ion implantation, and the readout is carried out by a single transfer from the photodiode via an adjoining MOSFET to a video out circuitry. These differences in structure, manufacture and readout result in wide differences in performances at high and low light levels and in image clarity. At low light levels, the minimum light that can be resolved by the image sensor largely depends on the light collecting ability of the image sensor, that is, the efficiency with which the image sensor can collect the light incident thereon, as well as noise introduced by the sensor cell and its associated circuitry. In general, the MOS image sensor converts light to signals more efficiently than the CCD this results from the differences in the amount of light reflected from the imaging surface of each device and in the aperture efficiency.The CCD image sensor has an array of two or three layer electrodes on the imaging surface, which absorb much light, so that the CCD image sensor collects less light than does the MOS image sensor. Two common techniques are used to illuminate the semiconductor substrate in monolithic image sensors front and back illumination. Either technique could be used with either CCD orMOS image sensors but the front illumination is not suitable for use with the CCDs because most CCD structures have an uneven front and charge transfer electrodes thereon which reduce the light collecting area. It is apparent that MOS structures have not a completely flat front, either, and are that when theylilluminated from the front the amount of light reflected from the imaging surface is greater than in the case of a completely flat front surface. Unfortunately, back lighting introduces a fabrication problem a requirement for a thin substrate and performance limitations on the spatial resolution. In the case of the back illumination, the substrate must be made very thin so that light generated carriers which are usually generated within about 5 pm of the semiconductor surface for visible light in the case of a silicon substrate may be efficiently collected and stored in a depletion layer beneath capacitor electrodes on the front side. The thinnest substrate that can be fabricated has a thickness of about 25 pm.This means that device elements cannot be spaced less than 25 pm apart namely, since the carriers generated by back lighting in the substrate spread by diffusion, it is necessary from the viewpoint of the spatial resolution that the thicker the substrate becomes,the more MOS electrodes on the front be spaced apart. This is a restriction that limits the potential resolution of back illuminated CCDs. This limitation on the element spacing is especially damaging for large capacity image sensors having a large number of picture elements because it means that each picture element covers a relatively large irea,resulting in a large silicon substrate being needed. Clearly, front illumination is desirable for simple structures to give good resolution. MOS image sensors, fortunately, have a silicon oxide film layer covering the semiconductor substrate, and this transparent oxide film acts as an optical coating that matches the optical impedance of the silicon to the impedance of air. Some CCD image sensors also have been built with polycrystalline silicon electrodes that can be illuminated from the front, but these polycrystalline structures provide poor impedance matches with the oxide film beneath, which causes reflection at the polysilicon oxide interface. These mismatches create interference patterns in the surface reflection, resulting in a decrease in the signal photocurrent output. Whether the image sensor array is illuminated from the front or the back, noise introduced into the video signal by the image sensors and associated circuitry is the greatest factor that limits operation at low light levels. The noise, which masks small output signals at low light levels, comes from mismatches in parasitic capacitances and thermally generated carriers. Moreover, CCDs suffer noise from transfer losses. In MOS image sensors, there is posed a problem by capacitive coupling noise that results from mismatches between parasitic gate source and gate drain MOS capacitance of transistors in the scanning circuit and photodiodes and video output port with which these capacitances are in series . When these MOS transistors are turned on or off, there is a corresponding voltage spike on the analog photosignal line video line being switched. Although these spikes may be reduced by Jow pass filtering, because they occur at twice the maximum video frequency, they cannot be eliminated completely. The variation in the magnitude of these spikes throughout the MOS photoarray gives rise to fixed pattern of noise in the video passband. This type noise can be eliminated by low pass filters. Fortunately, the variation in the noise is small compared to the absolute magnitude of the spikes. Spike noise, as observed at the sensor output, is referenced to an equivalent noise voltage across the capacitance of the photosensing element, for example, in a representative 512 element line sensor . Values of noise range from about 1 x 10 3 to 0.5 x 10 2 volts, well within practical operating levels. The saturated output signal referred to the photodiode is typically 5 volts, resulting in dynamic ranges of 100 to 1 and more. While CCDs are not affected by the fixed pattern noise from the spikes in switching transistors, they have fixed pattern noise resulting from capacitance between clock lines and the output lines. Luckily, these noise pulses are all the same height and can be filtered out by low pass filters, but the filters consume power and occupy space. The best method of reducing this capacitive coupling noise is to fabricate video preamplifiers on the same image sensor chips. The noise is thereby reduced because the magnitude of the parasitic coupling capacitance may be made smaller for amplifiers on the same chips than for off the chip amplifiers. Fixed pattern noise in both MOS image sensors andCCDs can also come from thermal effects thermally generated carriers . The CCD image sensors, however, are more susceptible to thermal effects than are the MOS image sensors because the surface of the CCDs is not in equilibrium, which causes thermal imbalance. This form of noise is most troublesome at illumination 2 levels below 10 pW cm and for light integration periods longer than 100 msec for typical image sensors because the noise comprises a significant portion of the dark current at these levels and represents the ultimate operating limitation. But with the CCD image sensors, transfer loss noise is more damaging than the fixed pattern noise. This reduces the exposure range of the CCD image sensors and consequently decreases the contrast that they can detect. Now, the conventional image sensors will be evaluated from the standpoints of 1 dynamic range, 2 sensitivity, 3 noise and 4 image clarity, which are important performance criteria. In ordinary image sensors, the lower limit of the dynamic range depends on the spike noise resulting from the aforesaid capacitive coupling and the thermal noise dark current noise , and the upper limit is, in the MOS image sensors, the bias voltage of the photodiodes and, in the CCDs, the depth of the potential well both of which are about 5V .In terms of 2 sensitivity, letting the capacitance for storing carriers and the amount of charges being stored be represented by C5 and Q, respectively the stored voltage is given by Q Cs. This photodiode voltage is capacitively divided by the output line capacitance CB and output voltage is represented as the following voltage EMI7.1 where CB is the capacitance of the output line. That is, the stored voltage Q C5 is divided by the sum of the capacitance C B of the output line and the storage capacitance C5 and the output voltage is reduced to Q CB CS . Further, it is a matter of course that the influence of noise must be taken into account when discussing the sensitivity. Moreover, the sensitivity depends on the amount of light that is sensed by sensor cells, that is, their light collecting ability the problem of sensitivity should be considered from the view points of unevenness of the illuminated surface and the impedance matching, too. The most critical is the spike noise that results from the capacitance coupling and ranges from 10 3 to 0.5 x 10 2 V and defines the lower limits of the dynamic range. The dark current noise poses a problem as the light integration period becomes longer for example, in excess of 100 msec at low light levels below 10 ssW cm2 and it limits the operational range of the image sensor. In terms of 4 spatial resolution, the smaller the cell area, the better. In practice, however, for example, the back illumination type CCD image sensors must be designed so that the electrodes are spaced more than the thickness of the substrate apart. Further, since the voltage Q CS stored in the storage capacitance Cs of the image cell is read out in the form ofEMI8.1 reduced by the capacitive devision with the output line CB, operational amplifiers with high sensitivity and low noise are needed and a minimum area of the image cells is limited which depends on the sensitivity of the operational amplifiers and the noise level . The light integration period which is determined by a reciprocal of the frame frequency gives temporal resolution time like image clarity . The CCD image sensors have such a serious drawback that since information is transferred through the cell structure, if even one of the image cells is defective the signal intensity of all image cells preceding the defective one are subject to changes. Accordingly, all the cells must be fabricated defect free but such cells are difficult to manufacture with good yield. In contrast thereto, the MOS image sensor which can be read out by the random access system is free from the abovesaid defect resulting from the charge transfer. Since the MOS image sensor has the arrangement that charges stored in photodides are read out, however, it is difficult to raise the sensitivity and an amplifier with very low noise and high sensitivity is required. The present inventors have propose a novel image sensor which incorporates therein a hook structure having an amplifying function with a view of removing the aforesaid defects of the prior art CCD and MOS image sensors, in particular, increasing the light detecting sensitivity. This novel image sensor excels the CCD and MOS image sensors in the capability of highly sensitive random access of light information.The inventors make further proposals concerning its operating characteristics and optimum device design conditions.

In the case where the channel length of the MOS structure is not made so short, it is also possible, of course, that the regions 10, 10 and 13 and the regions 9, 9 and 14 are formed as the p region 10 and the n region 9, respectively. Reference numeral 15 indicates isolation regions. In the embodiment of Fig. 1A, a major storage capacitor C5 and an earth line are not illustrated for the sake of brevity but it should be understood that the semiconductor image sensor of the present invention includes the major storage capacitor of an A 5iO2 polys licon structure and the earth line, as described later for example, in connection with Figs. 8 and 9A see IEEE Transactions, on Electron Devices, Vol. ED 26,No. 12, 1979, P 1975, Fig. 11 A brief description will be given of the impurity concentrations and sizes of the abovesaid regions. The impurity concentrations artabout 1018 21 1021 3 The impurity concentrations are about 1018 to 1021 cm 3 in 18 2 3 the n region 5, about 10 18 to 10 21 cm in the n region 8, about 1018 to 1021 cm 3 in the n region 11, about 1016 to 1018 cm 3 in the n region 14, about 1015 to 1018 cm in the p region 7, about 1018 to 1021 cm 3 in the p region 12, about 1016 to 1018 cm in the p region 13, about 1014 to 1016 cm 3 in the nregions 9 and 9 , and about 1014 to 1016 cm 3 in the p regions 10 and 10 .The impurity concentration of the region 6 is determined in relation to its thickness Q. When the voltage VS is applied, the region 6 is exposed to an electric field which depletes its entire area and permits holes to flow throughout the depleted region 6 at high velocity. The thickness ofthe region 6 is determined in relation to the spatial resolution. 5 The thickness of the n regionLis closely related to color sensitivity. The penetration depths of light having wavelengths of 7000, 5000 and 4400 into silicon are approximately 5, 1 and 0.5 Am, respectively. Accordingly, for enhancement of sensitivity to blue and purple, it is preferred to form the n region 5 as thin as possible, for example, around 0.5 pm or less. The sensitivity to blue and purple can further be increased by removing the n region 5 to provide a heterojunction between the region 6 and the transparent electrode 4. The transparent electrode 4 is formed, for instance, using In203,SnO2 or low resistivity polysilicon. The thickness of the p buried region 7 ranges about 0.2 to 3 Mm. It is desirable to minimize the thickness of the region 7 unless it is depleted but, in view of reduction in yield resulting from difficulty in manufacture, it is preferred that the region 7 be 0.2 Am or more in thickness.The reason for which the region 7 is formed to a thickness of 3 AAm or less is to facilitate an efficient outflow of electrons from the n region 8. The depth of the buried region 8 is about 0.5 to 3 sum. The thicknesses of the gate insulating films 9 and 10 are, preferably, in the range of 100 to 1000 A. When the working voltage is low, these films may be thinner than 100 A. A description will be given of the operation of this embodiment. The optical input, which has passed through the transparent electrode 4 formed of SnO2, In203 or doped polysilicon applied with the fixed bias voltage V generates electron hole pairs in the hook structure made up of the of the n region 8, the p region 7, the p region 6 and the n region 5, in particular, in the high resistivity layer 6 near the n layer 5. By the voltage VS , r an electric field is applied to the high resistivity region 6 to completely deplete it over the entire area thereof, permitting holes to flow substantially throughout it at a saturated velocity.In the case where the spatial resolution need not be so high, the field intensity of the high resistivity region 6 may be made lower. The electrons thus generated are all absorbed into the n region 5, attracted by the bias voltage.V8 , whereas the holes are stored in the p region 7 flowing through the high resistivity region 6. This is because the high resistivity region 6 is substantially entirely depleted by the bias voltage Us and because a high intensity field is applied over the entire thickness Q of the high resistivity region 6.When the holes are accumulated in the p region 7, it is charged positive namely, the potential barrier height for electrons in the n region 8 is lowered, permitting the electrons to flow out from the n region 8 towards the substrate across the thin p region 7. As a result of this, electrons are depleted in the n region 8 which is held floating relative to an earth liMe not shown via an electrostatic capacitance Cs, the n region 8 is charged positive and consequently its earth voltage V t increases with the lapse of time. This increasing voltage value V t is read out by the readout transistor Q1 onto the signal output line 2 at a desired time. The The voltage V t of the n region 8 increases with the optical irradiation time this is because the amount of holes accumulated in the p region 7 increases as the optical irradiation proceeds. A sufficiently long period of time after the start of optical irradiation, the voltage V t assumes a value which is approximated by the following equation EMI19.1 ................. 1 where is the junction capacitance of the pn junction formed between the p region 7 and the n region 8, c is light velocity, q is a unit charge and S t is the photon density photons cm3 which is a function of time. Equation 1 is important in that the voltage V t proportional to the time integrated value of the photon density of the optical input is obtained, and in that the voltage V t independent of the storage capacitance C5 of the n region 8 is stored therein. For a better understanding of the latter feature, reference be made to Fig. 1C. Fig. 1C shows the relationships between C B tC5 and V p V out using the value of the photon density S as a parameter, where C B is the capacitance of the signal output line, V p is the voltage of the p region 7 and Vout is an output voltage value read out on the signal output line. A voltage Vout t , which occurs on the. signal output line i upon conduction of the transistor Q1 by opening the address line word line 1, is not the voltage obtained by the division of the capacitances C5 and CB EMI20.1 Letting the time constant of the transistor Q1 which is determined by a on resistance R and the capacitance C B be represented by RBCB, the abovesaid voltage is given byEMI20.2 ............... 2 Accordingly, the voltage on the signal output line 2 is stillV t if the time constant is ignored.This means that a sensor has incorporated therein the time variable voltage sourceV t proportional to the time integration of the optical input.In the prior art MOS and CCD image sensors, the readout voltage is capacitively divided and, letting the charges stored by optical irradiation in the storage region be represented by Q, the readout voltage is given byEMI20.3 as referred to previously. In contrast thereto, in the image sensor of the present invention the readout voltage is Q Cf almost independent of the çgpácitances CS and CB. In other words, the sensitivity of the readout voltage is substantially Cs CB Cf times higher than that obtainable with the conventional sensors. The sensitivity is readily improved 10 to 100 times as high as that in the past. In the conventional image sensors, the voltage of the storage region is read out by the division of the storage capacitance and the signal readout line capacitance, whereas in the image sensor of the present invention, the stored voltage is read out substantially as it is. This difference will be described in more detail. In the prior art system, upon conduction of the readout transistor, the charges stored in the storage region decrease . It value is as follows EMI21.1 Usually, CB C5 and the readout voltage is greatly decreased by the capacitance division. Therefore, a stacked capacitor structure which maximizes the capacitance C5 with the smallest possible cell has been employed by preference. On the other hand, in the image sensor of the present invention, for example, depicted in Fig. 1A, when the readout transistor is conducted, electrons flow into the n region 8 from the n region ll. In the prior art system, the amount of electrons lacking decreases by the amount of electrons having flowed in the region.In the image sensor of the present invention, however when the electrons flow into the n region 8 to decrease the amount of electrons lacking therein, and reduce the positive voltage, the junction between the n region 8 and the p region 7 is deeply biased in the forward direction and the electrons in the n region 8 flow out therefrom towards the high resistivity region across the p region 7, resulting in the voltage relationship between the n region 8 and the p region 7 becoming nearly equal to the original relationship. In short, the electrons that flowed 11 into the from the n region 11 intothe n region 8 are absorbed into the n region 5 via the p region 7 and the high resistivity region 6.Therefore, the readout voltage becomes substantially equal to the voltage of the n storage region 8, no matter how large the signal output line capacitance C B may be. In the image sensor of the present invention, the readout voltage is given substantially by Q Cf. The junction capacitanceCf decreases with a decrease in the cell area. If a lens provided in front of the optical input receiving surface has a resolving power latr ge enough to sufficiently collect the incident light, then the stored charge Q hardly decreases with a decrease in the cell area and only the junction capacitanceCf decreases, so that the readout voltage increases more and more. This presents a striking contrast to the conventional image sensors in which a decrease in the cell area causes a decrease in the readout voltage. The above indicates that the storage capacitance C5 of the n region 8 need not always be large in relation to the signal output line capacitance CB, but in relation to the junction capacitance Cf, it is preferred that the capacitance Cs is large. Fig. 1D shows the relationships between C5 Cf and Vp Vn using the photon density as a parameter. In Fig. lD,Vp is the voltage of the p region 7 and Vn is the voltage of the n region 8. As is evident from Fig. 1D, V V increases monotonicalw with an increase in CS Cf.Accordingly, for enhancement of the sensitivity, it is desirable that C5 Cf is as large as possible, but from a tradeoff with a. difficulty in fabrication, Cs Cf 3 is a proper range for realizing the image sensor of the present invention. Fig. 1E shows an example of variations in the volta Vp of the p region 7, the voltage V t of the n region 8 and the n signal output voltage VQut t with time in the case where two readout operations are carried out during the same optical input period. In Fig. 1E, Vnr t is the voltage of the n region 8 in the readout process. The voltage Vp of the p region 7 increases linearly with time independently of the readout operation. This means that holes stored in the p region 7 are not affected by the readout operation.On the other hand, the voltageVn of the n region 8 increases with time keeping a constant difference with the voltage Vp but in the readout process, undergoes such a transient change as indicated by Vnr. This is because during the readout process electrons flow into the n region 8 to temporarily lower the voltage thereof. The refresh transistor Q2 in Fig. 1 remains in the OFF state in the optical irradiation period, during which a gate of the transistor Q1 is turned on by sampling pulses iSi ... 5n of a sampling period ts, by which the continuously changing integrated output V t of the optical input in formation S t is provided on the bit line at time intervals divided by the sampling period ts. The holes stored in the p region 7 are refreshed by the transistor Q2 at intervals of Ts. The thickness of the p region 7 is selected to be smaller than the diffusion length of electrons which are injected thereinto from the n region 8. It is desirable that the thick ness of the n region 8 is larger than the diffusion length of holes. The holes stored in the p region 7 become extinct mainly in the thermal generation recombination process but some of them flow flow into the n region 8 due to diffusion and disappear there. Since the actual optical information is determined by the of holes stored in their region 7, it is not desirable that the holes flow into the n region 8. In practice, the n region 8 is charged positive as the electrons therein are depleted, so that the holes are next injected thereinto in quantities. The potential ofthe junction between the n region 8 and the p region 7 is slightly Sower than a diffusion potential in thermal equilibrium by an amoupt dependent on the difference in the effective mass between the electrons and the holes and becomes a forward bias. Further, as the voltage with which the n region 8 is charged positive increases, a conduction channel is likely to be formed between the n region 8 and the source region of the transistor Q1 and the holes of the p region 7 are also liable to fly into the channel region. In order to prevent that the holes stored in the P region 7 flow out into the n region 8, it is preferred, according to the present invention, to form the n region of a wide band gap material of which for example, doped SIPOS Semiconductor Insulating PolycrystallineSilicon . The SIPOS for the n region 8 consists of 55.4 of silicon, 44 of oxygen and 0.6 of phosphorus. The band gap of this material is 1.5rev, which is larger than that of silicon therefore, it prevents the flowing thereinto of the holes from the p region 7 and raises the. efficiency of electron injection from the n region 8 as well.Moreover, the use of the SIPOS extremely improves the response speed of the hook structure composed of the regions 8, 7, 6, and 5 to the optical input, that is, the frequency characteristic of the hook structure. The image sensor of the present invention is characterized in that optical information time divided by the sample period t5 is read out non destructively. The time like image clarity, i.e. the temporal resolving power for the readout is determined by the frequency characteristic of an optical sensing portion by the hook structure, the frequency characteristic of the readout transistor and the parasitic capacitance C B of the signal output line. The frequency characteristic in the hook structure part is improved by forming the n region 8 of the doped SIPOS or the like to provide a wide band gap and reducing the thickness of the p region 7. In Fig. i the transistors Q1 andand Q2 are described to be MISSITs but may also be J SITs, MOSFETs, MISFETs orJ FETs, or any combination of them. As for the readout transistor, it is desirable to employ a SIT which exhibits a linear current voltage characteristic, not a conventional device of a saturated current voltage characteristic. This is because in the present invention the dynamic raçge is enlarged to increase the linearity of the output voltage. In the conventional image sensors, the optical irradiation period determined by the frame frequency provides the temporal resolution, whereas in the present invention, the temporal resolution is raised corresponding to increased sensitivity. Also in the spatial resolution, the image sensor of the present invention is far more excellent than the prior art image sensors, Since the image sensor of the present invention is designed to satisfy the following equation 3 EMI26.1 ...... 3 where is the dielectric constant and E5 is the electric field at which the carriers reach the saturated velocity, so that when holes of a 6 function like distribution n0 x, y the x axis is parallel to the main surface of the substrate and the y axis is perpendicular to the x axis occur in the junction interfacebetween the i region 6 and the n region 5, the high resistivity region 6 of the thickness Q is almost depleted by the bias voltage VS and the carriers in the high resistivity layer 6 transit mostly at the saturated velocity, the distribution of the holes at the co ordinates x, y after t sec is given byEMI27.1 4 where nO is the total number of the holes of the initial 6 function like distribution, V5 is the saturated velocity of the holes which is substantially 1 x 107cm sec and D is the diffusion length of the holes in the high resistivity region 6. Letting the thickness of the high resistivity region 6 be represented by Q, the transit time T of the holes in the x direction in the high resistivity region 6 is given byEMI27.2 ........... 5 Accordingly, the distribution of the holes in the p p junction is given byEMI27.3 6 and the hole distribution in the y direction in the interface of the P P junction spreads only due to diffusion therefore, combining the distributions in the positive and negative directions in the y axis, it follows thatEMI27.4 7 With Q 100pm and VS 10V or so,EMI27.5 or so accordingly, the cell area can be designed small by that and the spatial resolution is also improved and, in addition, further large scale integration is possible.Moreover, the optical input receiving surface of the image sensor depicted in Fig. 1 is made substantially flat, so that the incident light can be collected over the entire area of the cell to provide for enhanced sensitivity. Although in the Fresent invention the cell area is made small, the output voltage per optical irradiation area is approximatelyEMI28.1 as described previously and the absolute value of the voltage to be read out is about C5 CB Cf times larger in terms of sensitivity than in the prior art image sensors in which the voltage read out by the carrier storage operation is obtained by the voltage division by capacitance. Accordingly, not only the spatial resolution but also the output sensitivity are essentially improved. As is evident from the schematic circuit diagram of Fig.1B, the applied voltage Vs is divided by each of series connected diodes D1 and D2 and the storage capacitance C5 of the n region 8. In the transient state immediately after the application of the voltage Vs , the diode D1 is approximated by an electrostatic capacitance C. which is inversely proportional to the thickness Q of the high resistivity region. Accordingly, in order to achieve the optimum condition for applying most of the voltage Us to the high resistivity region 6, it is desirable to select the thickness Q of the high resistivity region 6 so that Ci Cf, C5. In the present invention, measures are also taken for the thermal noise which is one of the factors defining the lower limit of the dynamic range. The present invention employs such a structure and impurity concentrations that the occurrence of a dark current in the sensor proper is decreased one to two or more orders of magnitude, as compared to the conventional MOS and CCD image sensors. In Fig. 1A, the region by which light is sensed is the high resistivity region 6 and the dark current of this light sensing region depends on the electrons in the p region 7 and the holes in the n region 5 if there hardly exists in the high resistivity region 6 deep impurity levels which excite carriers. Letting the acceptor impurity concentration of the p region 7 and the donor impurity concentration of the n region 5 be represented by NA and ND, respectively, and assuming that the impurities are mostly ionized, the minority carriers in the respective regions are given byEMI29.1 where n. is the density of carriers which are thermally excited in an intrinsic semiconductor. By selecting the carrier density ni to be 1.6 x 1010 cm 3 at room temperature and the about donor impurity ND to be 1020 cm 3, the number of the minority carriers Pn0 can be suppressed to about three to four.P saturated current of a pin diode in the reverse biased condition is approximately given byEMI30.1 Equation 10 is applicable to the case where the diffusion lengths L and Ln of holes and electrons are smaller than the p thicknesses Wn and W of the n and p regions 5 and 7, res p pectively. If the thicknesses Wn and Wp become smaller than the diffusion lengths L and Ln, L and Ln in equation 10 are p p respectively replaced with Wn and W . In equation 10 , D and p pDn are the diffusion constant of holes in the n region 5 and electrons in the p region 7.When the voltage Vj in equation 10 becomes large to some extent, equation 10 can be rewritten as follows EMI30.2 As is apparent from equations 10 and 10 , if P and npO are small, the dark current JS becomes small. In the case where the deep impurity level density in the high resistivity region 6 is sufficiently small and the generation recombination is almost negligible, the dark current becomes as indicated by equations 10 and so on.In this case, by employing such a structure in which the n region 5 has a sufficiently high impurity density and the p region is almost depleted to perform what is called the SIT like ope7r t i5n, the amount of carriers flowing into the region 6 from the both ends thereof can be made sufficiently small, by which the dark current can be extremely reduced. At the present technological level, the dark current is mostly a generationrecombination current in the high resistivity region 6. The use of a region of extremely high purity as in the present invention enables remarked reduction of the dark current and hence is advantageous. In the image sensor of the present invention, the upper limit of the dynamic range is determined, in principle, by the voltage Us and, for instance, it reaches a voltage value exceeding Us 2. If the voltage of the n region 8 is positive and too high, the field intensity in the high resistivity region decreases, resulting in a nonlinear effect. Accordingly, if the voltage V5 is raised, the upper limit of the dynamic range rises by that. In the present invention, the upper limit of the dynamic range is improved at least one order of magnitude over that in the prior art.As regards the voltage spike noise resulting from the capacitance coupling, the parasitic capacitances of the readout transistor Q1 and the refresh transistor Q2 are reduced in connection with the sensor cell portion. Further, a lowpass filter and a video preamplifier of high sensitivity and low noise are provided in the video output port. The output sensitivity is extremely high, as described previously, because the stored voltage v t is outputted substantially as it is without being divided by the capacitance of the output line. Furthermore, because of the non destructive readout, the image sensor of. the present invention is of extremely good image clarity in terms of both. space and time.By forming the n storage region of a material having a large forbidden band gap, the holes stored by optical excitation are prevented from flowing into the n storage region 8, in consequence of which the linearity of response of the output to the optical input is extremely improved. In Fig. 1, the readout transistor Q1 is described to be an n channel MISSIT and the refresh transistor Q2 is described to be a p channelMISSIT but these transistors Q1 and Q2 may also be the BJT,MOSFET or J FET as described previously. It is preferred to employ such transistors that exhibit a linear resistance and a linear current voltage characteristic, not such devices that exhibit a saturation characteristic which limits the currentvoltage characteristic. Figs. 2A and 2B are respectively a sectional view an equivalent circuit showing the principal part of another embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 2, the major storage capacitance Cs and the earth line are not shown, as is the case with Fig. 1. In this embodiment, the readout transistor Q1 is an n channel J SIT or JFET and the refresh transistor Q2 is a p channel MISSIT or MISFET. Reference numeral 17 indicates a bit line connected to an n source region 29 of the readout transistor p1, which bit line is formed of doped polysilicon or silicide of a metal such as tungsten, molybdenum or the like 18 designates a address line connected to a p gate region 26 of the readout transistor pl which signal address line is formed of doped polysilicon or silicide of tungsten, molybdenum or formed by an aluminum electrode 19 identifies a gate electrode of the refresh transistor Q2 which is formed of doped polysilicon or silicide of tungsten, molybdenum or the like 20 denotes a transparent electrode connected to the voltage source Vs which electrode is formed of SnO2, In203 or polysilicon 21 represents an n region 22 shows a high resistivity layer 23 refers to a p floating region and 24 indicates an n floating region. The structure of Fig. 2A is identical with the structure of Fig. 1 in that the n region 21 may be removed to provide hetero junction between the region 22 and the transparent electrode 20, too. The hook structure composed of the n region 24, p region 23, p region 22 and the n region 21 constitutes a light sensing structure as is the case with the embodiment of Fig. 1.Reference numeral 25 indicates an n region of an n channel JSIT JSIT 26designates a p gate of the readout transistor Q1 27 identifies a channel region of the refresh transistor 28 denotes a drain of the transistor Q2 which is grounded via a line 28 formed of doped polysilicon or silicide of tungsten, molybdenum or the like 30 represents a buried layer provided for limiting a depletion layer of the channel to improve the OFF characteristic of the transistor Q2 and for lessening the influence of a rays and the like, which buried layer need not always be provided and 27 shows a part of the channel region 27, which is not indispensable but may be filled with an insulator or the like.Similarly, an n region 30 may also be an insulator material layer it is proper to use , for example, the SIMOX technique or graphoepitaxy and laser anneal technique. The region shows the gate insulating films of refresh transistor Q2 and the region 27 , 31 and 31 are the. insulating material regions for isolation. 31 is an isolation region. This embodiment is fundamentally identical in operation with the embodiment of Fig. 1. The thickness Q of the high resistivity layer 22 and the impurity concentrations and thick nesses of the p region 23, the n region 21 and the n region 24 are substantially the same as those in the hook structure of the embodiment depicted in Fig. 1. The impurity density of the n region 25 is usually selected to be about 5 x 1015 cm 3 or less. The impurity densities are increased as the gate to gate spacing is increased. It is further preferred to prevent holes stored in the p region 23 from flowing out therefrom into the n region 24 by forming the latter of a material which has a wide energy gap, such as SIPOS, as described previously. This will improve the frequency characteristic of the hook structure with respect to light, as referred to previously. The embodiment of Fig. 2 also exels the conventional image sensors in terms of 1 dynamic range, 2 sensitivity, 3 noise and 4 image clarity. Further, this embodiment is capable of non destructive readout and the sensitivity of the voltage appearing on the signal readout line is determined by the .voitagev t of the nt region 24, not by the capi h S r division, as in the embodiment of Fig. 1. Figs. 3A and 3B are respectively a plan view and a sectional view showing the principal part of another embodiment of the present invention, the major storage capacitor Cs being omitted. Fig. 3B is a sectional view taken on the line A A in Fig. 3A. In the embodiments of Figs. 1 and 2, the refresh transistor Q2 is provided adjacent the readout transistor Olr that is, the transistors Q1 and Q2 are formed in pair, whereas in the embodiment of Fig. 3, the refresh transistor Q2 is disposed at a position higher than the readout transistor Q1 and arranged so that during the refresh operation, holes stored in a p region 46 are flowed out therefrom into a p diffusion line an earth region 56 at a stroke see Fig. 3A . The hook structure formed by an n region 47, p region 46, D region 45 and an n region 44 indicates a transparent sensing region. Reference numeral 43 indicates a transparent electrode connected to the n region 44, which electrode is formed of SnO2, In203 or doped polysilicon. By forming the refresh transistor Q2 in the vicinity of the surface of the substrate assembly, the packing density of the image sensor cell array is increased and the spatial resolution is also increased compared to that obtainable in the case where the refresh transistor Q2 is disposed adjacent to the readout transistor Q1 in the semiconductor substrate.The sensor cells are arranged substantially symmetrically with respect to a mesh like p earth line region 56, so that during refreshing holes stored in the respective p region 46 can be taken out in common thereto. Fig. 3B clearly shows that this embodiment employs, for refreshing, a junction FET using the p floating regions 46 of adjoining cells as the drain and the source 52 , an n region 42 as the gate and a channel region 53 as the channel. This refresh transistor Q2 may be a JFET formed principally of polysilicon. By forming the doped polysilicon region 52 between the channel region 53 rendered monocrystalline by laser anneal and the p region 46 on either side thereof, the source drain region is formed.On the junction type n gate portion 42 formed by diffusion or ion implantation a refresh line of polysilicon, WSi2 or MoSi2 is wired so that the image cells on both sides thereof may be refreshed in common. An n region 49 is the source region of the readout transistor Q1 an n MISSIT or MISFET . Reference numeral 48 indicates a channel 41 designates a gate insulating film which is formed of Si N4, SiO2 or the like and on which is wired a word line 41 of silicide of a refractory metal such as tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum or the like and 40 identifies an electrode connected to the n region 49, which electrode is formed of doped polysilicon, MoSi2, WSi2, TaSi2,TiSi2 or the like. The electrode 40 is common to the source region 49 of the readout transistor Q1 of the adjoining image cell and the electrode 40 is connected via a contact 55 to a signal readout line 40 .The signal readout line 40 is also formed of doped polysilicon, MoSi2, Ski2, TaSi2, or the like. A region 50 is provided for limiting the depth of a depletion layer in the channel region 48 to speed up the operation, for lessening the influence of a rays and the like and for improving the OFF characteristic in the case of the channel length being reduced, as already described with regard to the embodiments of Figs. 1 and 2. A region 51 is formed of non doped polysilicon. Of course, it may be formed ofSiO2, Si3N4 or the like. Regions 54 are isolation iayers.The refresh transistor Q2 is shown to be the JFET but may be another transistor, for example, a MOSFET or the like. Fig. 4A shows equivalent circuits of six cells of the image sensor depicted in Figs. 3A and 3B. Reference numeral 61 indicates an address line 62 designates a refresh line and 63 identifies a signal output line. As is seen from Fig. 4A, the refresh line is common to all of the cells. Fig. 4B illustrates an example of the circuit arrangement of a color area image sensor system employing the image sensor cells. Reference numeral 60 indicates the individual image cells 57 designates a vertical scan and refresh signal generator for controlling voltages of the address lines 61 and the refresh lines 62 58 identifies a horizontal scan and video output circuit and 59 denotes a color separation and mixing circuit an image processing unit which performs color separation and mixing to provide a color TV signal output. In Fig. 4B, the circuit arrangement is such that signals of green G , red R and blue B of the cells designated by color filters are taken out from the same signal readout line. 64 is a synchronisation pulse generator. Fig. 5A shows an example in which the signals G, R andB are taken out from different signal readout lines. In Fig. 5A, the image cells which are designated by color filters are arranged in a checkered pattern and the signals G,B and R are outputted from different signal readout lines. Reference numeral 65 indicates signal address lines 66 designates a refresh line 67 identifies signal output lines for the blue B signal, 68 denotes signal output lines for a greys G signal 69 represents signal output lines for the red R signal 70 shows a vertical scan and refresh signal generator 71 refers to a horizontal scan and video output circuit and 72 indicates an image processing unit for color separation and mixing process. These parts are synchronized by pulses from a synchronizing pulse generator 73. Fig. 5B illustrates equivalent circuits of four of the image cells arranged the checkered pattern. A specific arrangement of the embodiment Qf Fig. 5 is identical with the embodiment of Fig. 3 except only in the connection of the readout line 40 or 40 in the latter. That is, in the embodiment of Fig.5, the bit lines are interconnected every other image cells in the horizontal direction. The image sensor of the present invention has such a striking feature that the voltage induced on the signal readout line hardly depends on the parasitic capacitance C B on the signal readout line, as described previously. In the image sensor of the present invention, the voltage occurring on the signal readout line suring the readout process is given by, VB t per optical irradiation area,EMI38.1 so that a decrease in the area of the image sensor cell surely causes a corresponding decrease in the junction capacitance Cf of the floating pn juntion, and consequently the output voltage occurring on the signal line increases by that.Conventional types of solid state color image sensors has the shortcoming that the use of the single plate system, instead of the three plate one, decreases the number of picture elements per color as compared with the three plate system, resulting in lowered resolution and sensitivity.In the prior art CCD or MOS image sensors, as described previously, the voltage to be read out is subjected to the capacitance C B of the readout line and the storage capacitance C5 decreases corresponding to the decrease in the cell area and, according, the voltage to be read out becomes CB Cs C P Cs where Q is the amount of stored charges.The voltage P CS stored in the capacitance Cs is multiplied by 1 1 CB Cs by the capacitance division and when the capacitance Cs becomes, for example, 1 3 Cs, the voltage to be read out becomes 1 1 3C5 C5 . In the image sensor of the present invention the output voltage is independent of the capacitances Cs and C B and is not read out by the capacitance division the voltageV t of the floating n region is outputted almostas it is, as referred to previously accordingly, the sensitivity of the output voltage does not lower. Further, a decrease in the area of each picture element increases the spatial resolution without impairing the sensitivity.That is, in the case of employing the image sensor of the present invention as a color image sensor, there is no likelihood of lowered resolution and sensitivity caused by using the single plate system instead of the three plate one in the prior art. On the contrary, when the area of each picture element decreases, the output voltage increases correspondingly and the spatial resolution also rises. Since the read out voltage is almost independent of the earth capacitance C5 of the storage region the floating n region for the amount of majority carriers lacking, there is practically no need of increasing Cs CB in the image sensor of the present invention. This introduces such a feature that the packing density can be made extremely high. Moreover, if the input light can be sufficiently collected by a lens, the sensitivity increases as the cell area decreases to reduce the junction capacitance Cf. The foregoing description has been given of the back illumination type structure from the standpoint of improving the photo detecting sensitivity. The image sensor of the present invention has the feature that a decrease in the cell are rather increases the sensitivity. Accordingly, the image sensor of the present invention fully exhibits the feature in the case of the front illumination type structure, too. The front illumination type structure is defective in that the effective optical irradiation surface area is reduced to introduce complexity in the wiring on the surface but advantageous in that the thickness of the semiconductor substrate need not be made small. Figs. 6A, B, C and D illustrate an example of the front illumination type image sensor of the present invention. Fig. 6A is a plan view of the image sensor, Fig. 6B a sectional view taken on the line A A in Fig. 6A, 6C a sectional view taken on the line B B in Fig. 6A and Fig. 6D a schematic circuit diagram. Also in Fig. 6, the storage capacitor Cs of the n floating region 87 is omitted. The photo sensing part is constituted by an n region 87, a p region 86, a p region 85, an n region 84 and a transparent electrode 83. The transparent electrode 83 is supplied with a predetermined positive voltageV and the p region 85 is completely depleted. The p region 85 is exposed to a high intensity electric field in this case, it is desirable to apply such a high intensity field that holes transit at a saturated velocity anywhere in the region 85. Reference numeral 96 indicates a p substrate. An n region 89, a p region 88, the n region 87, an insulating layer 81 and a gate electrode 81 make up the readout transistor 91. The refresh transistor Q2 is a JFET comprised of a p polysilicon region 92, a p polysilicon region 93, a p polysilicon region 97 and an n polysilicon gate 82 see Figs. 6A, B and C . Reference numeral 80 indicates a signal readout line B.L 81 designates an address line WL 82 identifies a refresh line R.L 97 denotes an earth line E L Fig. 6A 90 represents isolation regions for isolating each of cells from adjacent ones of them and 90 shows an isolation region for isolating the n region 87 and a part of the p region 86 from each other, which region is not always necessary. The p region 86 may adjoin, along its entire length, the n region 87, too. But the provision of the isolation region 90 brings about the advantage that the capacitance Cf of the p hole storing region 86 decreases to provide for increased sensitivity.Reference numerals 94 and 95 indicate insulating layers as of SiO2, S1 3N4 or the like. In this embodiment, since the region 86 for storing optically excited holes can be made small compared to such regions in the foregoing embodiments, the sensitivity tends to increase. It is desirable that the n region 84 is 0.5 pm or less in thickness and that the p region 85 is 5 pm or less in in thickness. The readout line 80 is formed of n polysilicon, silicide such as WSi2, MoSi2, TaSi2 or TiSi2, or a compound of them, The word line 81 is formed of of them. The word line 81 is formed of n or p polysilicon, silicide such as WSi2, M0Si2, TaSi2 or TiSi2, or a compound of them. The refresh line 82 is formed by an n polysilicon region, which may be covered with silicides, as required.The earth line 97 is formed by a p polysilicon region, which may also be covered with silicide, as required The impurity density of the p region 85 is approximately 1 x 1015 cm 3 or less and the impurity density of the p region serving as the channel of the readout transistor is around 5 x 1014 to 5 x 1016 cm The impurity densities of the other regions are the same as used in the foregoing embodiments. It is rather preferred that the p substrate has a lower impurity density, for example, about 5 x 1015 cm or less. As for the polysilicon JFET for refreshing, the thickness and impurity density of the channel region 93 are about 0.3 to 2 p and about 1 x 1015 to 1 x 1017 cm 3, respectively.In the case where the p region 85 is 4pm thick and has an impurity density of approximately 5 x 1014 cm 3 or less and the voltage Vs is 40 V, the electric field intensity over the entire area of the region 85 becomes substantially equal to 100 KV cm or so and almost all holes transit at the saturated velocity. The photo sensing and readout operation are the same as those in the embodiments of Figs. 1, 2 and 3.That is, holes excited in the p region 85 flow into the p region 86, wherein they are stored. The p region 86 having thus stored therein the positive charges is charged positively. From the n region 87 electrons flow out towards the n region 84, in consequence of which the n region 87 is also charged to a positive voltage substantially equal to that of the p region 86. This positive voltage is appeared on the signal readout line in the readout operation. Fig. 7 illustrates in section another embodiment of the front illumination type image sensor of the present invention. Also in this case, the storage capacitor Cs in the n floating region 187 is not shown. This embodiment differs from the embodiment of Fig. 6 in that the readout transistor MOSFET Q in the latter is a JSIT. The JSIT Q1 is made up of an n region 198, an n region 197, a p gate region 199 and n region 187. The p region 199 is the gate region and the n region 197 the channel region. The n region 198 and the n region 187 constitute main electrodes in which currents flow. The readout transistor Q1 and the refresh transistor Qz may each be any of the BJT bipolar transistor , theJFET, the MOSFET, JSIT and the MOSSIT. Fig. 8 is a sectional view illustrating another embodiment of the front illumination type image sensor of the present invention. In Fig. 8, reference numeral 284 indicates an n surface region 285 designates a p high resistivity region 286 identifies a p hole storing region 287 denotes a region which serves as an n excess carrier depletion region and, at the same time, serves as one of main electrode regions of the readout transistor 28,8 represents a p channel region 289 shows the other drain electrode region of the readout transistor 290 refers to an address line 291 indicates a signal output line 292 and 293 designate metal region,se 294 identifies an insulating region formed between the metal regions 292 and 293.The embodiment of Fig. 8 differs in construction from the embodiment of Fig. 7 only in that no refresh transistor is provided. The earth capacitance Cs of the sandwich structure metal region 292 insulating region 294metal region 293 is formed definitely. As mentioned previously, this capacitance C5 is not illustrated in the foregoing embodiments. The operation of the device depicted in Fig. 8 is basically identical with the operations of the devices already described therefore, no detailed description will be repeated thereof. A description will be given of structural improvements for increasing the performances of the image sensor of the present invention, in particular, the linearity.That is, in the present invention the photo sensing and storing portion is improved. When optically excited holes accumulate in the p region to charge it positively, electrons are injected into the p region from the floating n region adjacent thereto and flow out from the p region into the high resistivity region, thereafter being absorbed by the electrode on the surface of the device. In this case, as referred to previously, the holes stored in the p region also tend to flow into the adjoining n region. If the holes should flow into the n region, then there would be lost the linearity of photo detection that the n region is charged to a voltage proportional to the integrated value of the amount of incident light. One method for avoiding this is to form the floating n region by a wide band gap material. Another method is to facilitate flowing out of the electrons from the n region but to prevent the holes of the p region from flowing into the n region. This can be accomplished by grading the impurity distributions in the n region and the p region. In the p region, the impurity distribution is made so that the impurity density gradually decreases as the distance from the junction between the p region and the n region increases, whereas in the n region, the impurity distribution is made so that the impurity density rises as the distance from the junction between the n region and the p region increases. With such an arrangement, the electrons injected into the p regions flow into the high resistivity region, acceler ated by a drift electric field, but the holes in the n region are forced back by a decelerating electric field. The intensity E of an electric field which occurs, for example, when the impurity densities are distributed exponentially is given byEMI46.1 where K is the Boltzman s constant, T temperature, N2 the impurity density in the n p junction plane, and N1 the impurity density at a place spaced a distance W apart from the n p junction plane, In the case where N2 N1 100, 3 if W 0.5pom, then E 2.4 x 10 V cm at room temperature and if W lum, then E 1.2 x 103V cm.For example, in the n region, the impurity density is selected to be about 1 x 1019cm 3 in the junction plane and is 21 up to 1 x 10 21 3 increased up to 1 x 10 cm 3 or so as the distance from the junction plane increases, and in the p region, the impurity density is selected to be approximately 1 x 1018cm in the junction plane and is decreased to about 1 cx 1016cm 3 as the distance from the junction plane increases. From the viewpoint of promoting the flow of electrons while at the same time suppressing the flow of holes as described above, it is desirable that the value of N2 N1 is selected to be about 100 or more, but the image sensor of the present invention is similarly operable even if N2 N1 does not assume the abovesaid value.It is desirable that the impurity density of the p storage region is in the range of 1015cm and 1018cm 3. When this impurity density is lower than about 1015cm 3, the value of a built in potential formed between the p region and the n region becomes too low, resulting in reducing the hook function of storing holes in the p region. If the impurity density of the p region is higher than about 1018cm 3 then the junction capacitance Cf becomes excessively large, by which the stored voltage given by equation 1 is decreased and it becomes difficult to satisfy the conditon CS Cf 3, lowering the readout sensitivity. Figs. 9A and 9B are respectively a sectional view showing the construction of another embodiment of the present invention and its schematic circuit diagram.A description will be given first of the outline of the arrangement of this embodiment. In Fig. 9A, an n layer 205, an p layer 206, a p layer 207 and an n layer 208 constitute an n p n hook structure for optical signal detection use. In the equivalent circuit of Fig. 9B this hook structure is represented by a back to back connection of two diodes D1 and D2. In Fig. 9A, an n source region 212, a p gate region 202 , a p channel region 213 and an n drain region 208 form a readout SIT Static Induction Transistor , which is represented by Q in the equivalent circuit of Fig. 9B.In Fig. 9A, a p drain region 215, an n gate region 203 , a p channel region 214 and a p source region 207 make up a refreshSIT, which is represented by Q2 in the equivalent circuit of Fig. 9B. The n p n hook structure, the SIT Q1 and theSIT Q2 are formed in a single sil icon substrate to constitute the cell regions of one picture element of the image sensor.The cell regions are isolated by isolation regions 211 from one another in the direction of the main surface of the substrate.As is the case with the embodiment of Fig. 1, the image sensor of this embodiment is formed as the back illumination type in which optical information hv is inputted via a transparent electrode 204 to the surface of the n region 205 of the n p n hook structure. Next, respective parts in Fig. 9A wil be described in detail. Reference numeral 201 indicates a signal readout line, which is connected to an electrode formed of polysilicon, or polysilicon and a refractory metal such as molybdenum, tungsten, platinum or the like or its silicide of the n source region 212 of the SIT Q1 formed in the silicon substrate 202 designates a address line, which is formed by a diffused line of a p gate 202 of the SIT P1 or a line having its resistance partly decreased by polysilicon or a high melting point metal 202 identifies electrodes formed of polysilicon or a combination of polysilicon and a refractory metal molybdenum, tungsten, platinum or the like or its silicide 203 denotes a refresh line, which is formed by a diffused line of an n gate 203 of the SIT Q2 or a line having its resistance partly lowered by a metal or polysilicon 203 represents an electrode, which is formed of polysilicon or a combination of polysilicon and the refractory metal molybdenum, tungsten, platinum or the like or its silicide 204 shows a transparent electrode SnO or In203 for receiving the optical input, which electrode is connected to the power supply Vs and 205 refers to an n diffused region, which is doped to about 1019 to 1021. Reference numeral 206 indicates a high resistivity region, which may be a p or n region having an impurity 1013 to 1 x 1014 3 density of about 1 x 10 to 1 x 10 cm 3 or less. The relationship between the thickness Q of the region 206 and the positive bias voltage Us to be applied to the transparent electrode is selected to meet the requirement that the region 206 is depleted substantially over the entire area thereof. Reference numeral 207 designates a p diffused or ion implanted region, which forms a part of the hook structure to store holes and, at the same time, serves as the source region of the p channel SIT Q2 It is preferred to minimize the thickness of the p region 207 so that holes are stored therein and electrons efficiently flow flow outtherethrough from the n region 208 towards the high resistivity region 206. The p region 207 is formed, for example, about 0.2 to 3pm thick.Reference numeral 208 identifies an n region adjacent the p region 207 and separated by a capacitor C5 from the grounding point. When the SITs Q1 and Q2 are in the OFF state, the n region 208 ahd the p region 207 are both held in completely floating state. Reference numeral 209 denotes an oxide film or film of Si3N4 or Ta203 or a combination thereof, which is formed approximately 1000A or 200 to 1000A thick on a polysilicon layer 208 and 210 represents an earth electrode formed of aluminum or polysilicon. The polysilicon layer 208 , the thin film 209 and the earth electrode 210 form the storage capacitance C5. Reference numeral 211 show isolation regions, which are usually formed of Sio, and, in some cases, filled with polyimid or like insulating material 212 refers to an n source region of the SIT Qli and 213 indicates a p channel region of the SIT Q1 The SIT p1 is a device having a reverse conducting channel. The reason is that the SIT Q2 is a p channel SIT and that the layers 213 and 214 are formed concurrently. Reference numeral 215 designates a p drain region of the p channel SIT Q2, which region is connected to the electrode 210 and held at the ground potential 216 identifies regions formed of an oxide, nitride or like insulating material on opposing sides of the gate and drain of the p channel SIT Q2 for decreasing a parasitic capacitance therebetween and 217 denotes regions, each formed of an insulating material on the underside of the n gate 203 opposite the source region 207 so as to decrease the parasitic capacitance between the gate and source of the SIT Q2 as is the case with the regions 216.The regions 217 can be formed by the ion implantation of Q2 N2 or the like using the SIMOX Separation by InsulatedOxygen technique. Regions 218 and 219 are also insulator regions formed for the same purpose as the regions 216 and 217. Such a process is necessary when the best mode is effected, in particular, for decreasing the capacitance coupling noise in the image sensor. It is a matter of course that the insulating material regions 216, 217, 218 and 219 need not be provided when the operating characteristics may be deteriorated. By introducing similar insulating regions in SITs of an operational amplifier, a vertical and a horizontal scan circuit, a video output port of peripheral circuits, too noise reduction can be achieved. The operation of the embodiment shown in Figs. 9A and 9B is basically identical with the operations of the foregoing embodiments therefore, no detailed description will be repeated. Fig. 10 shows waveforms explanatory of an example of the operation mode of the image sensor according to the present invention, the abscissa representing time and the ordinate an incident photon density S t , a refresh signal on onthe refresh line, sampling pulses S1, S S3, Sfl on the address line and data pulses D1, D2, D3, ... D on n the output signal line. Applying the sampling pulses S1, S2, S3, ... 5n to the gate of the readout transistor after .conducting the refresh transistor by the refresh signal R and extinguishing excess hol es stored in the floating p region, there are read out on the signal output line the data outputs D1, D2, D3, ...D of magnitudes proportional n to the integrated values of optical signals inputted after the refresh. Equation 1 is an approximate expression in the state in which a certain amount of holes has been accumulated in the floating p region of the pn junction forming the hook structure a sufficiently long period of time after the start of optical irradiation of a fixed light level and the voltage V t of the floating n region has come to increase in proportion to time. Fig. 11 shows, based on a more detailed analysis, the transient state leading to the abovesaid state.In Fig. 11, the abscissa represents time after the start of optical irradiation and the ordinate the voltage Vp t of the floating p region indicated by broken lines apd the voltage Vn t of the floating n region indiated by solid lines . This analysis is made in connection with the case where the impurity density distributions of the floating n region and the floating p region are uniform and 1 x 10 3 and 1 x 1015cm 3, respectively, the thickness of the floating p region is 0.5 m and the junction area is 10 6cm2 , consequently the junction capacitance Cf is 0.01pF, and Cs is 0.lpF. The time t necessary for the voltage Vn t of the c floating n region to get sufficiently close to the voltage of the floating p region depends on the structure of the floating pn junction and the irradiated light level.Accordingly, the moment for recording a still picture, that is, the moment of shutter release is selected to be the moment l when a period of time longer than the time tc has lapsed after the strat of the optical irradiatiOn or turing OFF of the refresh transistor. The time c decreases as the. thickness of the floating p region decreases, as the impurity density gradient in the floating p region becomes steep and as the irradiated light level increases. For example, in the embodiment of Fig. 1A, in the case where the impurity density and its distribution in the floating p region are a constant density distribution of 1015cm 3, the thickness of the region is 0.Spm and CS Cf is 10, if the irradiated light level is 10 luxes, then the time tc is l.lmsec. In the above case, if the impurity density is graded so that it decreases about three orders of magnitude as the distance from the floating pn junction plane increases, then the time tc is reduced down to 0.88msec. On the other hand, when the optical input has a light level of 1 lux, the time tc is 8.6 and 5.6msec in the two cases, respectively. These characteristics proved to be the same in the other embodiments. Although in the foregoing embodiments no mention is made of a matching multi layer film which improves the matching for the incidence of light, for example, on silicon, it is a matter of course to provide the multilayer film on the optical input receiving surface for raising the light detecting sensitivity. Further, in the case of providing a color detection, cells of blue, green and red, for example, are arranged in a checkered pattern but, in this case, color filtersare provided on each cell. For detecting a light having a wavelengh longer than lpm, a material responsive to long wavelength light, such as Hg Cd Te or the like is grown heterogeneously or deposited by the CVD method, sputtering or evaporation on the surface of the photo detecting portion of silicon. Since a high intensity electric field is applied to this region, excited carriers rapidly flow into the storage region therefore, the light detecting sensitivity does not much depend on the quality of material used for this region. In the case of detecting lights of shorter wavelengths than purple, a material of large energy gap, such as ZnSe or the like is coated to a predetermined thickness on the light detecting portion. While the foregoing description has been given of the case of using light as a source of radiant energy, it may be replaced with X rays, electron rays or the like so long as it generates electron hole pairs in the image sensor. It is a matter of course that the image sensor of the present invention is not limited specifically to the foregoing embodiments. The image sensor of the present invention is sufficient if it is provided with the light detecting portion having the hook structure and constructed so that optically induced electrons or holes are caused by a high intensity electric field to drift transit and stored as majority carriers in a floating high impurity density region and the majority carriers flow out therefrom via a high impurity density region adjacent thereto and opposite in conductivity type thereto and flow into a light detecting high resistivity region and the amount of majority carriers lacking is stored. The smaller the electrostatic capacitance Cf of an excessive majority carrier storage region is, the more the readout sensitivity increases.The readout voltage is hardly dependent on the magnitude of the electrostatic capacitance Cs of a storage region for the amount of majority carrier lacking. In order to prevent that the majority carriers stored in the excess majority carrier storage region flow into the storage region for the amount of majority carrier lacking, it is extremely effective to make the impurity density of the latter lower than that of the former or to gradually increae the impurity density of the latter as the distance from the junction plane there between increases. The readout transistor and the refresh transistor Q2 are operable no matter which one of the JSIT, MOSSIT, JFET, MOSFET and BJT is used.The storage region for the amount of majority carriers lacking forms one of the two main electrode regions of the readout transistor and the excess majority carrier storage region the other. Since the sensitivity rises with a decrease in the electrostatic capacitance Cf of the excess majority carrier storage region, the cell area can be reduced especially in the structure in which the refresh transistor is formed as a polysilicon JFET or polysilicon MOSFET on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate, the cell area can be made extremely small. This is true especially in the case of the back illumination type. At least the present day technical level, it is easy to reduce the cell area down to 10 x 10 or less.Accordingly, the area of a cell array having 500 x 500 picture elements can be decreased to 5 x 5 mm2 or less for monochrome display and 9 x 9 mm2 or less for color display.Even if the peripheral portion is included, the area of the cell array is 2 array is 7 x 7 mm or less for monochrome display or 11 x 11 mm or less for color display. While the foregoing embodiments of the present invention have been described in connection with the case where holes excited in the light detecting region are stored in an excess majority carrier storage region a p r ÇlQn In this case and electrons are flowed out from a storage region for the amount of majority carrier lacking an n region in this case , it a matter of oourse that the conduc ti vity types of the regions can be reversed.The thin, high impurity density region formed on the surface of the light detecting portion and serving as an electrode region is not necessarily called for and the provision of the Schottky junction with the transparent electrode would rather increase the photo detecting sensitivity to short wavelength lights such as blue and purple. In the case where a high impurity density is called for on the surface of the light detecting portion at any cost, it is sufficient, of course, to form only one layer of a high impurity density region of a larger energy gap than the silicon substrate, preferably, a high impurity density region of an indirect transition type material. The incident light is hardly absorbed by this impurity density region but it is absorbed by the high resistivity region.At any rate, the present invention permits very diversified modifications of the structure and is of great industrial utility because of excellent performances and a wide application. The image sensor of the present invention is applicable to the detection of a color or monochrome video signal, that is, to movie cameras and, by making positive use of the feature of the non destructive readout, it can be very effectively used for the detection of a color or monochrome still picture, that is, for still cameras, as described in the foregoing. Accordingly, the image sensor of the present invention has a wide application. The image sensor of the present invention can be fabricated through the use of the conventionally known crystal growth, diffusion, ion implantation, wet and dry etching, CVD and lithography techniques. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention described in the foregoing. Accordingly, the appended claims are recited to cover such modifications and variations, too. A semiconductor image sensor of wide dynamic range, high sensitivity, low noise and high image clarity which is provided with a hook structure for detecting radiant energy input information, a readout transistor and a refresh transistor and which is capable of non destructive readout of optical information, and a method of operating such a semiconductor image sensor. The impurity densities in the hook structure, their distribution profiles, materials of layers of the hook structure and their thicknesses are so selected as to optimize the carrier storage function of the hook structure, thereby permitting the non destructive readout of the optical information. The ratio between the junction capacitance and the earth capacitance of a floating pn junction establishing. a potential barrier in the hook structure is selected so that a stored voltage in the floating pn junction and thsreadout sensitivity may become maximum. By repeating the non destructive readout, an integrated value of the quantity of incident light is read out. The time interval to a first operation of the readout transistor after the operation of the refresh transistor is selected in accordance with the quantity of the incident light, by which an electric signal proportional to the quantity of the incident light can be read out.
