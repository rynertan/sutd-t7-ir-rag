## Description
SPECIFICATION A Substance Potentiating the Activity of Antibiotics and its ProductionTechnical Field This invention relates to a novel substance F3 which potentiates the activity of antibiotics, salts thereof, and methods of producing F3 and said salts.Background Art Until now, the protein SP127 has been known as a substance which potentiates the activity of antibiotics M. Kikuchi et al. The Journal of Antibiotics 30, 209 214, 1977 , and it potentiates the antibacterial activity of macrolide antibiotics ibid. 30, 215 220, 1974 . On the other hand, clavulanic acid is konwn as a substance which prevents inactivation of ss lactam antibiotics by 6 lactamases and synergistically potentiates its activity against ss lactamase producing bacteria D. A. Leigh et al.,Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, 1981 7, 229 236 .Disclosure of the Invention This invention relates to a substance F3 which potentiates the activity of antibiotics, salts thereof, and a method of producing them. Namely, this invention relates, in one aspect, to 1 a substance F3 which potentiates the activity of antibiotics and salts thereof, and, in another aspect, to 2 a method of producing a substance F3 which potentiates the activity of antibiotics, characterized by cultivating a strain which belongs to the genus Pseudomonas and is capable of producing a substance F3 which potentiates the activity of antibiotics in a culture medium and harvesting from the resulting culture broth the substance F3 thus produced as a metabolite. The present inventors isolated from soil samples a large number of microorganisms for the purpose of developing new antibiotic substances and searched for antibiotics in the metabolites elaborated by these microorganisms.This exploration led them to the finding that certain strains among these isolates would produce a novel substance which potentiates antibacterial activity, that the strains belong to the genus Pseudomonas, and that a substance capable of potentiating the antibacterial activity of S lactam antibiotics against gram negative bacteria can be caused to accumulate in a culture medium by growing such a strain of microorganism therein. The present inventors accordingly isolated the substance, studied its physical, chemical and biological characteristics and, based on these characteristics, confirmed that this substance which potentiates the antibacterial activity is a novel active substance. They termed it Substance F3 which Potentiates the Activity of Antibiotics . It should first be noted that in this specification the substance F3 which potentiates the activity of antibiotics will sometimes be referred to briefly as F3. In the present invention the F3 producing strain may be any species of microorganism which belongs to the genusPseudomonas and is capable of elaborating F3. For example,Pseudomonas acidophila G 6302 and Pseudomonas mesoacidophilaSB 72310 may be mentioned.

The strain belonging to the genus Pseudomonas which are employed in accordance with this invention are generally liable to vary their characteristics and behavious and tend to undergo mutation when exposed to ultraviolet light,X rays, chemical mutagens and other artificial agents.However, even such mutants or variants can be employed only if they are able to elaborate F2 which is the contemplated substance of this invention. In cultivating the above strains, mutants and variants, there are employed such assimilable carbon sources as glucose, sucrose, maltose, spent molasses, glycerol, oils e.g. soybean oil, olive oil, etc. , organic acids e.g.citric acid, succinic acid, gluconic acid, etc. . The nitrogen sources that may be employed include various organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds such as soybean meal, cottonseed meal, corn steep liquor, dried yeast, yeast extract, meat extract, peptone, urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, etc. There are also employed such inorganic salts as are commonly used in the cultivation of bacteria, such as sodium chloride, calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, monopotassium phosphate, disodium phosphate, etc. It was found that sulfur compounds which the strains can utilize, i.e. inorganic sulfur compounds such as sodium sulfate, sodium thiosulfate, etc. and organic sulfur compounds such as cystine, cysteine, methionine, etc.would lead to an increased yield of F3. Particularly preferred are cysteine and sodium thiosulfate. The concentration such sulfur compounds is 0.01 to 1.0 w v and preferably 0.02 to 0.5 w v . The addition of a sulfur compound to the medium results in an increased yield of F3 and is therefore very advantageous in commercial scale production. If necessary, there are also incorporated in the medium heavy metal compounds such as ferrous sulfate, tin sulfate, etc. and vitamins such as vitamin B1, biotin, etc. It is also possible or advantageous to add an antifoam or and a surfactant, such as silicone oil, polyalkylene glycol ether, etc. In addition, organic or and inorganic materials that will promote production of F3 may also be incorporated in suitable amounts. The cultivation can be carried out either in solid medium or in liquid medium by a conventional antibiotics production method. While the cultivation in liquid medium may be conducted under standing still or with stirring, shaking or aeration, spinner culture under aeration is especially preferred. The cultivation is performed preferably at a temperature within the range of about 150C 350C, at a pH of the medium within the range of about 4 8, generally for about 8 168 hours, preferably for 24 144 hours. The thus produced substance F3, which is present for the most part in the culture broth filtrate, is advantageously isolated and purified from the supernatant following separation of the culture broth into a supernatant and bacterial cells by centrifugation or filtration. It is also possible to isolate and purify substance F3 directly from the culture broth. The potency of substance F3 can be determined, for instance, by the cup method of paper disc method using bouillon agar containing 0.05 pg ml of cefmenoxime withEscherichia coli IFO 12734 as the test organism. The substance F3 which potentiates the activity of antibiotics can be harvested by any means commonly used for harvesting metabolites produced by microorganisms. Thus, for example, bacterial cells are removed by centrifugation and the filtrate is subjected to a common process known for isolation and purification of effective substances. Thus, there are utilized solubility or solubility difference in an adequate solvent, difference in manner or rate of precipitation from a solution, difference in affinity with a variety of adsorbents, ion exchange chromatography with an ion exchanger, concentration under reduced pressure, lyophilization, crystallization, recrystallization, drying and other means, either alone or in combination in an optional order, either singly or repeatedly. A specific example of recovering the metabolite is as follows. The culture broth after completion of the cultivation is filtered, the filtrate is passed through an activated carbon column, and the thus adsorbed substance F3 is eluted with a hydrophilic organic solvent system. The hydrophilic organic solvent system is, for example, a mixed solution composed of water and one or more of lower ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone, and lower alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, propanol and butanol. Since the desired substance is an acidic substance, the ion exchange resin is advantageously a Cl type one, such as an anion exchange resin Amberlite IRA 400, 402, Rohm Haas,USA Dowex l, Dow Chemical, USA Diaion SA 21A, MitsubishiChemical, Japan .The thus adsorbed active substance, F3, is eluted with an aqueous solution of sodium chloride, for instance. For desalting, the eluate is again subjected to activated carbon column chromatography. The eluate containing the active substance is concentrated, then acetone or the like is added, and the precipitate is collected by filtration, washed with acetone, ether or the like and dried to give a pale brown powder. For further purification of the powder, column chromatography with QAE Sephadex Pharmacia, Sweden is advantageous. Thus, after washingQAE Sephadex A 25 is washed with phosphate buffer pH 6.6 , an aqueous solution of the above powder is passed through the column for adsorption, and the column is washed with the same buffer and then eluted with the buffer containing 0.5 w v of sodium chloride.The active fractions are pooled, adjusted to pH 3.0 and again passed through an activated carbon column. The column is rinsed with water and elution is performed with 50 v v aqueous methanol. The active fractions are pooled, concentrated under reduced pressure and lyophilized to give a powder of F3. This product is capable of forming metal and ammonium salts. The metal salts may for example be sodium, potassium and lithium salts. The physico chemical properties of F3 monosodium salt as obtained in Example 1 are as follows. Appearance of the substance White powder 2.

Furthermore, F3 strongly inhibits the growth ofEscherichia coli in synergy with cefmenoxime. In Table 3, there are shown degrees of growth of Escherichia coli under the influence of F3 in the copresence of 1 pg ml of cefmenoxime.

As is evident from Table 3, F3 inhibits the growth ofEscherichia coli in the presence of cephalexin or cefmenoxime, as evidenced by the decrease in absorbance. Observation of the culture broths under a phase contrast microscope revealed that, when F3 was not added, cells were in the much elongated form under the influence of cephalexin or cefmenoxime but that, when F3 was added, the elongation was inhibited in dependence on the addition level and at the same time partial swelling occurred and bacteriolysis proceeded. The substance F3 which potentiates the activity of antibiotics obtainable by the method of the present invention showed a marked antibacterial activity in synergy with cefmenoxime or cephalexin in Escherichia coliinfected rice. Therefore, F3 can be used in combination with such antibiotics in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by the above bacteria in mammals e.g. mouse, rat, dog, human and in domestic fowls e.g.chicken, duck . For the treatment of Escherichia coli infection, for instance, a solution of 0.5 2.0 g of, for example, cefmenoxime and 0.5 10 g of F3 in 10 100 ml of physiological saline is administered to human adults two to three times a day in admixture with an injectable solution for intravenous drip infusion. F3 is also a very promising intermediate for the synthesis of novel drugs. When F3 was intravenously administered to mice, theLD50 was more than 1 g kg. For comparison of the substance F3 which potentiates the activity of antibiotics, which has the above properties, there may be mentioned first of all such water soluble, Scontaining, acidic antibiotics as penicillins and cephalosporins. In contrast with these, substance F3 shows no absorption at wavelengths over 1720 cm 1 in the infrared absorption spectrum and, when tested in a usual manner, does not show any antibacterial activity. Therefore, F3 is different from said antibiotics. Moreover, while many antibiotics are known which are produced by Pseudomonas bacteria, F3 differs from all of them in physical, chemical and biological properties.It is, therefore, considered that F3 is a novel compound. The following examples are further illustrative but not limitative of this invention. The percents given in the examples are by weight volume unless otherwise stated.
