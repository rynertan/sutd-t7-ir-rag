# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR LUBRICATING A DRILL BIT

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for providing a flow of lubricating fluid from a surface mounted lubricating fluid source 20 through a rotatable drill pipe 16 to rotary cutting cones of a rotary drill bit 12 for drilling in an underground formation, including pump means 24 for providing a flow of lubricating fluid from the fluid source to an end of the drill pipe. Drill pipe conduit means extending along the length of the drill pipe is provided for receiving the flow of lubricating fluid and for directing the lubricating fluid flow along the drill pipe to the drill bit. Distribution conduit means at the drill bit extends from the drill pipe conduit means to the cutting cones and receives the flow of lubricating fluid from the drill pipe conduit means for directing the lubricating fluid flow to the cutting cones for lubrication thereof.
