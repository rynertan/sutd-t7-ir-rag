# SUPERPOSITION OF PIVOTED PAD SLIDER BEARING AND SQUEEZE FILM FLUID MECHANICS FOR HEAVILY CYCLICALLY LOADED MACHINE ELEMENTS

## Abstract
For bearings subject to fully reversing cyclic loads in ser vice, low friction and high load capacity can be achieved with a very strong pivoted pad bearing structure designed for large squeeze film effects in addition to the steady state pivoted pad slider film forming effects. The invention consists of the combi nation of 1 a pivoted pad slider bearing capable, because of either stiffness or elastic characteristics, of maintaining proper geometry between the film forming sliding surfaces under peak loads 2 a mechanical setting where the pivoted pad is subject to fully reversing cyclic loads 3 spacing of parts so that there is room for an enlarged clearance between the pad sliding surface and the surface against which the pad slides during load reversal and 4 means to assure flooded lubrication conditions so that a relatively thick oil film is established be tween the sliding surfaces on each load reversal. With these conditions met, squeeze film effects increase film thickness and reduce friction in cyclically loaded service.
