# Apparatus for spinning bicomponent filaments.

## Abstract
A spinning assembly for use in a process for the production of sheath core bicomponent fibres comprising a spinneret plate 1 having at least one counter bore 2 terminating in an extrusion orifice 3 , a distributor plate 4 spaced apart from but facing the spinneret plate 1 to provide a liquid channel 5 therebetween for communication with a source of sheath forming material, the distributor plate 4 being provided with an aperture 7 opposite each orifice 3 in the spinneret plate 1 for communication with a source of coreforming material and a plateau like protrusion 9 on the distributor plate 4 extending about the axis common to the aperture 7 and the extrusion orifice 3 characterised in that there is provided an orifice plate 11 for restricting the entrance to the counter bore 2 .
