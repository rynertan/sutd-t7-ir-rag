# Structural information detector.

## Abstract
A self contained, unitary device 410 for collecting and interpreting data reflecting the effect of a force acting on a structure 411 includes a housing 412 adapted to be attached at spaced points to the surface of the structure 411 , an optical sensor 413 within the housing 412 for detecting the relative orientation 413a of spaced surface coordinate vectors 416 of the structure 411 , and circuitry 414c within the housing 412 for converting signals 413b from the optical sensor 413 to a form usable by signal processing electronics 415 also located within the housing 412 . The output of this structural information detector 410 embodies useful information which directly indicates the effect of the force acting on the structure 411 .
