# Infrared furnace with controlled environment.

## Abstract
An insulated firing chamber 12 has oppositely disposed sidewalls with a plurality of aligned pairs of holes. A plurality of infrared lamps 50 are disposed in the chamber 12 . The end terminals 52 of the lamps pass througn the respective pairs of holes to the exterior of the chamber 12 . The end terminals 52 of the lamps 50 are enclosed by sealed compartments so the only way for gas to escape from the compartments is through the holes in the sidewalls of the firing chamber 12 . Nonreactive gas under pressure is introduced into the com partments to induce unidirectional gas through the holes into the firing chamber 12 . The gas introduced into the com partments cools the end terminals 52 of the lamps 50 with out danger of contaminating the environment inside the firing chamber. The compartments each have an access opening, a removable hatch 66 that engages a gasket 64 on the com partment around the opening to seal the opening when the hatch 66 is in place.
