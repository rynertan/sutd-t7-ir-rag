A process for preparing a compound of formula XI which comprises reacting a compound of formula VEMI6.3 with a compound of formula IVEMI7.1 whereby R1, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined above in the presence of formaldehyde, an acid catalyst such as acetic acid and an organic co solvent.

## Description
ISOXAZOLYL INDOLAMINESThe invention relates to a compound of formula XIEMI1.1 wherein R1 represents hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, C1 4alkyl or C1 4alkoxy, R3 and R4 represent, independently, C1 4alkyl or together with the adjacent nitrogen atomEMI1.2 wherein n is 1, 2 or 3, R5 represents hydrogen or C1 4alkyl and R6 represents hydrogen, C1 4alkyl, phenyl or phenyl mono substituted by fluorine, chlorine, C1 4alkyl or Cl 4 al koxy. Compounds of formula XI can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VEMI1.3 with a compound of formula IVEMI2.1 whereby R1, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined above,in the presence of formaldehyde, an acid catalyst such as acetic acid and an organic co solvent. Examples of suitable solvents are ethers such as diethylether, tetrahydrofuran and particularly dioxane. Preferred temperatures are from about 100 to 300C, most preferably 0 to 10 C. Preparation of compounds V is described in our co pending application no. The products resulting from the above processes can be isolated and purified in conventiona7 manner. Intermediate compounds can where appropriate be further reacted without isolation., Insofar as the production of other starting materials is not described above, these are either known or can be prepared in conventional manner from known starting materials. The compounds of formula XI may be employed in the production of pharmacologically active end products. They may for example be reacted with an alkali metal cyanide such as sodium or potassium cyanide to produce a mixture of a compound of formula XaEMI2.2 and formula XbEMI3.1 which, following conversion of Xb to Xa by conventional hydrolysis techniques, may in turn be converted into a compound of formula IIIEMI3.2 by introduction of the group X. These compounds may then be reacted with a compound of formula IVEMI3.3 to give a compound of formula IIEMI3.4 which in turn may be reduced to yield a pharmacologically active compound of formula I EMI4.1 In the compounds of formulae I, II, III, IV, Xa and Xb, R1, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined for formula XI, and X represents a leaving group such as chlorine or bromine. The end products of formula I are described and claimed in our co pending application no. 81810131.3 Publ. No. 0038298 Al which also describes the processes outlined above and preferred substi tuents. The following Example in which all temperatures are in C and room temperature is 20 300C illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 2 t3 Ethyl 5 methyl 4 isoxazolyl 3 tdimethylamino methyl indole Compound of formula XI A mixture of 20.6 ml 0.24 mol 37 aqueous formaldehyde, 18 ml 0.12 mol 40t aqueous dimethylamine and 80 ml acetic acid is cooled to 0 and treated by the dropwise addition of 25.5 g 0.113 mol 2 3 ethyl 5 methyl 4 isoxazolyl indole in a solution of 45 ml acetic acid and 125 ml dioxane. After addition is complete the mixture is stirred for 1 hour at room temperature and poured onto 500 ml ice water. The resulting solution is made basic with 20 potassium hydroxide and then extracted with methylene chloride. The methylene chloride is washed with water, brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and evaporated to give a gum that crystallizes to give 2 3 ethyl 5 methyl 4 isoxazolyl 3 di methylaminomethyl indole m.p. 880 to 900
