Employing a modification of this procedure which condenses aminopyrazines with a halo carbonyl compounds prepared in situ from their diethylacetals, and newly developed methods involving condensation between a dihalopyrazine and an a hydroxy alkylamine or a propargyl amine, a number of novel imidazo l,2 a pyrazines have been prepared and converted to piperazinyl imidazo 1,2 a pyrazines. These compounds are found to be 5 hydroxytryptamine agonists or reuptake blockers, and accordingly show anorexic, antidepressant, antihypertensive and or analgesic activity.

As the novel compounds of this invention are organic bases, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those resulting from the neutralization of the base with an acid. The acid employed is usually an inorganic acid such as a hydrohalic acid such as hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid or phosphoric acid. An organic acid such as maleic, fumaric, tartaric, citric, acetic, salicyclic, succinic, benzoic, benzenesulfonic, glutamic, lactic or isethionic acid is also commonly used. Generally the neutralization is conducted in an inert solvent such as water a C13 alkanol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol a C3 6 ketone such as acetone, or ethylmethyl ketone an ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane acetonitrile or an aromatic solvent such as toluene.Mixtures of the above described solvents are also employed. Generally the neutralization is carried out in aqueous ethanol, at 00 750C, preferably at 00 250C, followed by filtration to collect the salts.

Generally, the reaction mixture is maintained at about 5 100 C, preferably at about 200 300C, until reaction is substantially complete, usually about 15 minutes to 48 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 24 hours. The starting materials in the preparation of the novel compounds of this invention are the substituted imidazo 1,2 a pyrazines of formula II .They are preparable from 2 aminopyrazines by the following methods as shown below in Routes a e EMI8.1 wherein, X is C1, Br, I or F and R11 and Rê each represents one of the following active electrophilic groups 1 halo C1, Br, I, F derived from a halogenating reagent such as N chloro succinimide, N bromosuccinimide, cl2, Br2, I2, t butylhypochlorite or perchlorylfluoride 2 lower alkylthio CH3S, C2H5S orC3H7S or CF3S derived from the corresponding sulfenyl chloride EMI9.1 derived from chiorsulfonic acid followed by amination orEMI9.2 derived from formaldehyde e EMI9.3 R1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, phenyl, halophenyl, C1 3 alkylphenyl, or C13 alkoxyphenyl. Routes a , b and c involve the most commonly used method for the synthesis of 1,2 fused imidazoles by alkylating a substituted 2 aminopyrazine with an a halocarbonyl compound to form a salt with the l pyrazinyl nitrogen, which in turn cyclizes on heating or treatment with a dehydrating agent such as trifluoroacetic anhydride to afford a substituted imidazo l,2 a pyrazine II . In Route b and c , R1 and R2 are introduced respectively via electrophilic substitution to give compound II inaccessible by Route a . On the other hand, Route d involves the nucleophilic displacement of the 2 halogen in a 2 halopyrazine followed by subsequent oxidation and cyclization to afford II . FollowingRoute d , a substituted 2 halo pyrazine of the structural formula IV wherein X and Y are independently at position 3, 5 or 6 X and Y are as previously defined in Formula I and i is halo such as chloro, bromo, iodo, or fluoro, is treated with a 8 hydroxy alkylamine of the structural formula EMI10.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as previously defined in formula I in an inert, polar solvent such as dioxane, N ,N dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, pyridine, or bis 2 methoxyethyl ether, preferably dioxane, at 250 l500C, preferably 90 120 , until the reaction is substantially complete, usually 6 48 hours, preferably 12 24 hours.The resulting 2 amino derivative, IVa , is then treated with a selective oxidation reagent such as trimethylamine sulfur trioxide complex in dimethylsulfoxide containing triethylamine at 100 450C, preferably at 20 300C, until reaction is substantially complete, usually 6 24 hours, preferably 15 18 hours, to afford the corresponding a keto derivative IVb .This in turn is cyclized by treatment with a condensation reagent such as trifluoroacetic, trichloroacetic, or acetic anhydride in an acid such as trifluoroacetic, trichloroacetic, chloroacetic or acetic acid, with the preferred combination being that of trifluoroacetic anhydride in trifluoroacetic acid, at 100 500C, preferably at 200 300C, until the condensation is substantially complete in about 10 minutes to about 3 hours, preferably 20 minutes to about 1 hour. The last procedure, Route e , involves the nucleophilic substitution of a 2 halopyrazine by propargylamine followed by the mercuric oxide catalyzed cyclo condensation in trifluoroacetic acid to give compound II . A novel method of treatment, involving the novel piperazinyl imidazof1,2 a pyrazines of this invention, comprises the administration of an active compound, for example, 3 chloro 6 l pipera zinyl imidazo l,2 a pyrazine, as an anorexic agent to a mammalian species, e.g. rats, rabbits, or human patients in amounts ranging from about 0.01 to about 20 mg per kg of body weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10 mg per kg of body weight in a single dose or in 2 to 4 divided doses. These compounds in the described dosages are preferably administered orally however, they can also be administered intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously. For example, for oral therapeutic administration, an active compound of this invention is usually incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, chewing gum, and the like. The amount of an active compound in such a therapeutically useful composition or preparation usually ranges from 1 to 500 mg, preferably 5 250 mg, per unit dosage. The previously described tablets, troches, capsules, pills and the like usually contain one or more of the following inactive ingredients a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin an excipient such as dicalcium phosphate a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin and or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain in addition to materials of the above type a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar, or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially nontoxic in the amounts employed. In addition to the anorexic activity described above, the novel compounds of this invention, for example, 3 chloro 8 l piperazinyl imidazo 1,2 a pyrazine and 6 chloro 8 1 piperazinyl imidazo l,2 a pyrazine, are pharmacologically active in regulating central serotonin levels in a manner suggesting that they are also useful as potential antidepressant, antihypertensive, analgesic and sleep inducing agents. For these usages, essentially the same doses and routes of administration as well as the pharmacological formulations as described previously are employed. The novel compounds of this invention are also e blockers and show the usual effects of blockade and are thus useful as antiarrhythmic agents. Essentially the same dosages, formulations and routes of administration described above are employed for this utility. The novel compounds also have the property of inhibiting the self administration of nicotine in laboratory animals and thus have utility as antismoking agents. Again the dose levels, formulations and routes of administration are as previously described.
