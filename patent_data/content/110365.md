# Video tape recorder.

## Abstract
A helical scanning type video tape recorder having a ro tary cylinder 2 which is slidable on a video tape 3 and a pair of vertical magnetization recording heads 11, 12 mounted on the peripheral wall of the rotary cylinder 2 at prescribed posi tions that plane of the vertical magnetization recording heads 11, 12 which faces the magnetic plane of the video tape 3 being provided with a main magnetic pole 33 and auxiliary magnetic pole 31 , thereby causing at least one portion 34a of the recording magnetic flux Î¦ passing from the auxiliary magnetic pole 31 to the main magnetic pole 33 to penetrate the recording magnetic layer 3c of the video tape 3 at sub stantially right angles.
