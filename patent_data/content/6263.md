# A stabilized rayon web and structures made therefrom.

## Abstract
A stabilized absorbent rayon web 1 which may be used alone or which may serve as outer piles for absor bent structures. The rayon web 2 may be a spunbonded web or an air laid, wet laid or carded web of staple length or longer fibers, with substantial fiber orientation in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the web by virtue of the way in which the web is formed or by virtue of mechanical or hydraulic needling. The thermoplastic web 3 is melted into the rayon web from the bottom surface thereof to a controlled penetration depth of from about 10 to about 40 and preferably from about 10 to about 25 . As a result, the cross over points of the rayon fibers are effectively stabilized form the bottom of the rayon web to the controlled penetration depth therein while the aesthetics of the upper surface of the rayon web are undisturbed. The thermoplastic web may be of any appropriate polymer and any structured form having an open area of at least about 40 . The stabiliz ed rayon web demonstrates improved resistance to sur face abrasion, improved tensile strength, improved web bulk and resiliency and improved dimensional stability, both wet and dry. The bottom surface of the stabilized rayon web can be heat bonded to other webs without the use of ad ditional thermoplastic material.
