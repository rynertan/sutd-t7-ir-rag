# Material produced from cross linked ionic chitin derivative, its preparation and use.

## Abstract
Problems have occurred using chitin derivatives having surface ionic groups as ion exchangers. These problems can be overcome by employing a material produced by acylating or treating with an acid the surface of a material composed of a cross lined ionic chitin derivative. The acylation or acid treat ment eliminates the surface ionic groups, for example by con verting them to non ionic groups. The resulting material can al so be employed in dialysis and in the separation and purifica tion of glycoproteins.
