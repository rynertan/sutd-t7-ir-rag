# Type wheel printer.

## Abstract
A printer employing a daisy type type wheel 27 . On a hub 28 of the type wheel a pin 40 is slidably disposed and is backwardly biased by a spring 41 to protrude from the rear surface of the hub. In a central opening 32, 33 of the hub a hair pin spring 34 having a pair of arms is disposed. The type wheel is fixed on a drive shaft 2a of a motor 2 through a coupling element 4 . The coupling element is provided with a projection 5, 6 which is fitted into the opening of the hub and engaged with the arms of the hair pin spring by snap action to latch the type wheel against the drive shaft in axial direction. In the axially latched state the pin is protruded from the front surface of the hub, resisting the resilient force of the spring, by the coupling element. When the coupling element is rotated more than one time the protruded pin is engaged with a stationary projection 18 to prevent the type wheel from rotating, with a result that the pin is aligned with a notch 7 formed on the coupling element and fitted into the same for latching the type wheel against the drive shaft in rotational direction.
