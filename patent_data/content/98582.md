# Method for patterning layer having high reflectance using photosensitive material.

## Abstract
A method for patterning a layer having a high reflectance includes directly forming on a layer 13 having a high reflec tance a light absorbing film 21 having a ratio of transmitted light intensity to exposing incident light intensity of not more than 30 and forming a photosensitive material film 14 on the light absorbing film 21 . A selected region of the photosensi tive material film 14 is irradiated with the exposing incident light, and the photosensitive material film 14 is developed to form a first pattern 14 . The light absorbing film 21 is selec tively etched using the first pattern 14 as a mask so as to form a second pattern 21 . Finally, the layer 13 having the high reflectance is selectively etched using the second pattern 21 as a mask.
