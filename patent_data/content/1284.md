# UV light stabilized compositions containing substituted 2 keto 1,4 diazacycloalkanes.

## Abstract
Novel polysubstituted 2 keto 1,4 diazacycloalkanes are powerful stabilizers for materials subject to ultraviolet UV light degradation, particularly for polyolefins. The cyclic 2 keto compounds of this invention have a a fixed two carbon bridge between the N¹ and N⁴ atoms of the diaza ring, the remaining portion of the ring having a variable length bridge of two or more carbon atoms, b and N adjacent carbonyl in the fixed two carbon bridge, and c at least one N⁴ adjacent carbon atom of the diaza ring is polysubstituted, that is, has two substituents which may be cyclizable. Compositions containing a the polysubstituted 2 keto 1,4 diazacycloalkanes of this invention, and b prior art polysubstituted 2 keto 1,4 diazacycloalkanes, exhibit excellent stability to UV light.
