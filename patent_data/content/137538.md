## Description
BIOPOLYMER FORMULATIONS AND PROCESSES FOR PREPARING THEM The present invention relates to a biopolymer formulation and in particular to a polysaccharide containing water in oil emulsion, a process for preparing such emulsions and a process for concentrating it. Polysaccharides play an important role as basic materials for the food industry. However an increasing interest for other applications is being developed, such as in printing ink, wherein they act as thickeners. In particular because of their ability to thicken these polysaccharides are now also applied in enhanced oil recovery operaticns and also appear to be very useful in drilling fluids and completion fluids at oil exploration sites Since highly concentrated aqueous solutions still only contain up to ten percent by weight of these biopolymers transport over long distances is not very economic especially when large amounts, required for enhanced oil recovery operations, have to be transported.Furthermore highly concentrated aqueous biopolymer solutions are difficult to handle because of their high viscosity which may cause pulping problems and losses when discharging containers. Therefore methods are being developed to obtain concentrates containing a higher percentage of the desired material in order to decrease the transport costs and improve the handability. UK patent application 2018300 describes dispersions in oil of thickening agents such as xanthan polysaccharides which can reach concentrations of up to 40 wt of the thickening agent. In order to prepare such dispersion one uses the biopolymer in powdered form as a starting material. However handling of powder is not entirely without difficulties. Dust problems inherent to the handling of powders and the fact that the powder has the tendency to clot when brought in contact with the dispersing liquid make the powder form less attractive. It has now been found that biopolymer in oil emulsions can be prepared having a concentration of polysaccharide which is rtuch higher than 40 wt and which emulsions appear to be surprisingly stable. The e present emulsions can suitably be prepared fran aqueous solutions of polysaccharides having a concentration of up to about ten percent by weight. Furtbe re, it is a characterising feature of the present invention that polysaccharides are substantially present in the emulsion in the form of globules or droplets which are still in a more or less swollen state and which, as is believed, makes then dissolve into water more easily than substantially water free particles.This characteristic of the present emulsion is especially in enhanced oil operations and when the emulsion is used e.g. in drilling muds and in well completion fluids very important,because for those applications free flowing and easy water dissolvable polysaccharide formulations are required, In conventional dispersions of polysaccharides derived from dry polysaccharide powder, the biopolymer particles are substantially water free and therefore dissolve morse slowly into water. They tend to stick together thus forming clots. Furthermore filterability problems can arise when dispersions are rehydrated. Accordingly the present invention provides a biopolymer water in oil emulsion comprising 1 70 wt polysaccharide in the form of water swollen particles, 10 60 wt hydrophcbic liquid, 5 60 wt water and 1 25 wt emulsifier. Preferable the biopolymer water in oil emulsion comprises in addition to 30 658 wt polysaccharide, 15 40 wt hydrophobic liquid, 5 25 wt water and 5 25 wt emulsifier, and 1 15 wt stabiliser. The emulsion according to the present invention may optionally contain mixtures of two or more emulsifying agents together with mixtures of two or more stabilising agents. Emulsifiers can suitably be selected fran non ionic like alkylphenol ethoxylates, ethoxylated long chain fatty acids, polyethylene glycol mono oleates, polyethyleneglycol dioleates, polyethyleneglycol laurates, sorbitan fatty acid esters such as the Span registered trade mark emulsifiers, which are emulsifiers of the German company Atlas Chemie GmbH, especially Span 80 which is sorbitan mono oleate and ethoxylated linear alcohols like Dobanol , a trade mark of Shell. Dobanol stands for a series of synthetic primary fatty alcohols having 9 to 15 carbon atoms. Further examples of suitable emulsifiers are the product from the company AKZO i.e. sorbitan mono laurate, sorbitan mono palmitate and sorbitan monc stearate sold under respectively the trade marks Armotan ML, Armotan MP and Armotan M5. Also the ethoxylated versions of the above compounds are suitable. Those are sold under the trademarks Armotan PML20, Armotan PMP 20 and Armotan PMS 20. Further combinations of the non ethoxylated and ethoxylated emulsifiers might be used. Sorbitan fatty acids can suitably be combined with poly oxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters.Other examples of non ionic emulsifiers can be found in the group of the ethoxylated octyl and nonylphenols and the ethoxylated alcohols. Cationic emulsifiers like ethoxylated fatty amines and primary fatty amines or other amine type of emulsifiers which are oil soluble can also be applied for preparing a biopolymer in oil emulsion. Ethomenes and Armenes of Akzo one Nederland b.v. based an tallow, cocco, soya and oleic oil such as Ethomeen T12 registered trade mark bis 2 hydroxy tallowamine , Armeen HT registered trade mark tallowamine are very suitable examples. Preferably the emulsifier is selected fran the group consisting of sorbitan mono oleate, sorbitan mono laurate, ethoxylated alkylphenol, sorbitan mono palmitate, sorbitan mono stearate and or the ethoxylated derivatives thereof, poly isobutylene maleic anhydride triethylene tetraamine, bis 2 hydroxyethyl tallowamine, tallowamine or combinations thereof. A prefered combination of non ionic emulsifiers is a mixture of sorbitan mono oleate and sorbitan mono laurate and an ethoxylated alkylpnenol and or a mixture of poly isobutylene maleic anhydride triethylene tetraamine and bis 2 hydroxy ethyl tallowamine. Stabilisers which appear to be highly suitable are selected from the group consisting of polyalkylmethacrylates, polyalkylacrylates, copolymers of alkylacrylates with vinyl pyridines and copolymers of alkylmethacrylates with vinyl pyridines. Their composition and their molecular weights may vary considerably.Typical examples are a copolymer of C20 22 acrylate and minor amounts of C16 18 acrylate having a weight average molecular weight Mw of 200.000 500.000 and a number average molecuar weight Mn of 49.000 76.000 as a ca. 50 w solution in toluene or xylene the toluene solution 40 w of active matter of a copolymer of C20 22 acrylate 89.4 w and 4 vinyl pyridine 10.6 w having a 70.000 to 270.000 and Mn 25.000 55.000 a 40 w concentrate in an HVI oil 60 of a copolymer of C16 18 alkylmethacrylate 44.5 w , Dobanol 25 methacrylate 10.0 w and Linevol 911 methacrylate 45.5 w with Mw 40.000 600.000 and Mn 20.000 150.000 a copolymer of C16 18 alkylmethacrylate 21.6 w , Dobanol 25 methacrylate 54.9 , Linevol 911 methacrylate 18.1 w and 4 vinyl pyridine 5.4 w with molecular weight Mw 155.000 200.000 and Mn 60.000 80.000 as a ca. 55 w concentrate in a mineral oil a copolymer of C16 18 alkylmethacrylate 4.0 w , Dobanol 25 methacrylate 76.7 w , Linevol 911 methacrylate 8.2 w and methyl methacrylate 11.1 w with Mw 105.000 140.000 and Mn 40.000 60.000 as as 60 65 w solution in a mineral oil copolymers of C16 18 alkylmethacrylate 30.1 w0, Dobanol 25 methacrylate 47.8 w and 2 or 4 vinyl pyridine 22.1 w with Mw 40.000 65.000 and Mn of ca. 22.000 as 44 w solutions in xylene. Donol 25 is a mixture of primarily primary lineair C12 15 aloohols. Linevol 911 is a mixture of primarily primary C9 11 alcohols. Other additives, such a dispersing agents can suitably be present in the water in oil emulsion according to the invention in odder to enhance the dispersibility of the formulation.Hydration time is shortened and the viscosity development is enhanoed and is faster when dispersing agents are used. Suitable dispersing agents are hydrofilic surfactants, known to those skilled in the art, like ethoxylated alkylphenols and ethoxylated alcohols sulfonates. Preferred dispersing agents are selected fran the group consisting of Nonidet NP50 , Dobanol or combinations thereof. Nonidet NP50 is nonyiphenol ethoxylate. Preferably the polysaccchride is derived fran micro organisms like Xanthomonas campestris NCIB11808, Xanthomonas campestris NCIB11854, Pseudomonas sp. NCIB11624 and Pseudaronas sp. NCIB11592 since these microorganisms are commercially readily available. However the polysaccharide may also be suitably produced by other micro organisms like Xanthomonas phaseoli, Xanthomonas carotae, Xanthomonas begomiae, Xanthomonas meanae, Xanthomonas malvacearum, Xanthomonas vesicatoria, Xanthomonas papavericola, Xanthomonas incanae, Xanthomonas translucens, Rhizobium meliloti, Alcaligenes faecalis var. myxogenes, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Agrobacterium radiobacter, and Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The polysaccharides is suitably applied in the form of an aqueous solution which, may be obtained by ultra filtrating and optionally concentrating of a fermentation broth, as described in European patent application 81201026.2, and or enzyme treatment, as described in European patent application 81200414.1, and or enzyme surfactant treatment, as described inEuropean patent application 82201253.0, and or contacting the fermentation broth with particles of solid siliceous material at an adsorption enhancing pH, as described in UK patent specification 1598594.Preferably the polysaccharide is derived fran a clarified and optionally concentrated fermentation broth being an aqueous solution, substantially free from cellular debris which contains 3 25 wt of polysaccharides. An emulsion prepared fran this starting material may therefore contain as low as l wt polysaccharide. The hydrophobic liquid is suitably an unsubstituted and or substituted hydrocarbon liquid which encompasses aliphatic and aromatic compounds. For instance hydrocarbons like a mineral oil, a kerosine or a naphta are suitable so are organic hydrocarbons like benzene, xylene and tolene. An oilphase on the basis of branched hydrocarbons for instance on the basis of isoparaffins is particularly suitable. Further water iirrriiscible alcohols having 8 to 20, preferably 8 to 12 carbon atoms, vegetable oils such as cornoji, peanut oil, soybean oil, and sunflower oil, esteralcohols, polyolethers or other heteroatans containing coddodnds for instance siliconoils may suitably be used as well.Certain halogenated hydrocarbons have also been found useful. Preferably the hydrophobic liquid is a white spirit or a mixture of white spirits. A preferred emulsion according to the present invention comprises comprises 30 60 wt polysaccharide derived fran Xanthomonas campestris NCIB 11808, Xanthomonas campestris NCIB 11854, Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 11624 and or Pseudcnonas sp. NCIB 11592, 25 45 wt of white spirit, 5 25 water and 5 20 of a mixture of sorbitan nono oleate and sorbitan mono laurate and or a mixture of poly isobutylene maleic anydride triethylene tetraamine and bis 20 hydroxyethyl tallowamine. The emulsions according to the present invention can be prepared using emulsification techniques known in the art. The present invention further provides a biopolymer emulsion which is Obtained after a biopolyrrer emulsion as hereinbefore described has been subjected to a shear treatment in high shear devices or to milling in a colloid mill whereby the size of the polysaccharide globules or droplets is substantially reduced and a finer emulsion is obtained. Besides emulsifers the emulsions according to the present invention may also suitably contain stabilising agents, suspending agents and surfactants to enhance e.g. stability and hydration, wettability of the polymer droplets upon dissolution in water.Furthermore the viscosity of the emulsion can be adjusted to anes wishes by adding oil viscosifiers, which are suitably oil soluble polymers. Also thickeners can be employed to increase the viscosity of the hydrophobic liquid or oil and to improve storage stability.Suitable examples of thickness include organophilic clays like the bentonites or montmorillonites which are amine treated to make them organophilic. Other thickeners which may be suitably employed are colloidal silica, fumed silica end the like. Commercially available thickener are Cab o Sil by Cabot andThixogel by Sud chemie . Additional thickners include metallic soaps, such as the rretal salts of higher monocarboxylic acids. The present invention also relates to an aqueous system whenever thickened by the incorporation of a biopolyner emulsion as described hereibbefore. Such an aqueous system is for instance a printing ink. Preferably the aqueous system is a flooding material which is used in enhanced oil recovery operations. Still further the present invention provides a process for concentrating a biopolymer emulsion as hereinbefore described which comprises removing water fran the emulsion by evaporation under reduced pressure and at eleveated temperature in order to get a higher concentration of biopolymers in the water in oil emulsion.Preferably the process is continued until the concentration of the biopolymers is in the range of 35 45 wt since it appears that at a concentration in that range the emulsion is most easily hydrated than at higher concentrations. However if desired further concentration towards 70 wt can be achieved. The e emulsion may also be concentrated by other evaporation techniques like azecO pic distillation, vacuum drying, spray dryng and microwave drying. Still preferably the concentration is achieved by filmevaporation which may suitably be carried out with a falling or climbing film evaporation and or wiped film evaporation. Most preferably evaporation is carried out in a rota vapor or a wiped film evaporator. In the present process the reduced pressure is preferably in the range of 1 50mm Hg and the tenperature is in the range of 40 1200C. The residence time of the biopolymer emulsion in the film evaporation equipment is short and suitable in the range of 1 20 min since longer residence times at higher temperatures might harm the biopolyrter. If the biopolymer emulsion appears to contain relatively coarse 0,1 5mm biopolymer droplets which may not be desired than the biopolymer emulsion is preferably subjected to a shear treatment or processed through a colloid mill in order to obtai an emulsion containing finer biopolymer droplets. The present invention will be further described with reference to the following Examples.Example 1 2 g Span 20 sorbitan mono laurate and 2 g Span 80 sorbitan mono oleate 196 gwhite spirit Shell Q3312 were mixed in a beaker glass. 200 g 9 wt Xanthan biopolymer aqueous concentrate, obtained by ultra filtration was added while using an ultra turrax mixed for 1 minute.
