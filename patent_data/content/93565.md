# Touch sensing device.

## Abstract
A touch sensing device has touch electrodes X1 to X3, Y1 to Y3 each of which can be touched by a human finger C To compensate for unwanted differences in electrical characteristics between touch electrodes compensating means 122 are provided. The compensating means 122 has compensating ele ments C1 to C4 selections of which are connected to the sensing portion 115,116,117 , in dependence upon data stored in a memory 114 , in accordance with the selection of touch electrodes for connection to the sensing portion.
