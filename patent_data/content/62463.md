# Computer or processor control systems.

## Abstract
A processor control system for controlling items of hard ware 16, 17 includes pairs of processors 10, 10a 11, 11a, asso ciated with the hardware items. One processor 10, 11 of each pair operates the process or processes H1, H2 for controlling the associated hardware whilst the other processor 10a, 11a of each pair operates other processes P3, P4, P6, P7, P8. In the event of a fault in say the processor 10, the processes P3 and P4 are transferred to spare processors 12, 12a and the hard ware control process H1 is transferred to the processor 10a. This arrangement makes more effective use of standby pro cessing capacity.
