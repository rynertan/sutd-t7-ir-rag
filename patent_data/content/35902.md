As used in the foregoing definitions the term halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iode the term lower alkyl is meant to include straight and branched saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, 1 methylethyl, 1,1 dimethyl ethyl, propyl, 2 methylpropyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the like lower alkenyl and lower alikynyl are meant to include straight and branched alkenyl, respectively alkynyl, radicals having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms the term cycloalkyl designates optionally lower alkyl substituted cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl and lower alkylene is meant to include straight or branched saturated lower alkylene radicals. The compounds of formula I can generally be prepared by the reductive amination reaction of an appropriately substituted cyclohexanone of formula II , wherein Ar1 and R1 are as previously defined, with an appropriate piperidine derivative of formula III , wherein A andR are as previously defined.EMI4.1 Said reductive amination reaction may conveniently be carried out by catalytically hydrogenating a stirred and heated mixture of the reactants in a. suitable reaction inert organic solvent according to art known catalytically hydrogenating procedures.Suitable solvents are, for example, water lower alkanols, e.g., methano1,2 propanol and the like cyclic ethers, e.g., 1,4 dioxane and the like halogenated hydrocartons, e.g., trichloromethane and the like N,N dimethylformamide dimethyl sulfoxide and the like or a mixture of 2 or more of such solvents, The term art known catalytically hydrogenating procadures means that the reaction is carried out under hydrogen atmosphere and in the presence of an appropriate catalyst such as, for example, palldium on charcoal, platinum on charcoal and the like.In order to prevent the undesired further hydrogenation of certain functional groups in the reactants and the reaction products it may be advantageous to add an appropriate catalyst poison to the reaction ixture, e.g., thiophene and the like.

The thus obtained aminocarbonyl compound may further be hydrolyzed in weak acidic aqueous medium, thus yielding the corresponding carboxylic acid.The carboxylic acid may be derived directly from the nitrile by hydrolyzing the latter in weak acidic aqueous medium, while the ester may be derived from the nitrile by alcoholyzing the starting nitrileThe carboxylic function may be converted into an ester function, an amide function or a halocarbonyl function following art known procedures, e.g., by stirring and, if desired, heating the starting carboxylic acid with an appropriate alcohol, respectively an amine and. a halogenating agent.

Due to the substitution on the cyclohexyl ring said compounds may be present in two different geometrically isomeric forms, namely cisand trans forms. Moreover, when R represents a lower alkyl radical, two additional asymmetric carbon atoms are present. Each of these chiral centers may be present in a.R and a S configuration, this R and S notation being in correspondance with the rules described by R. S. Cahn,C. Ingold and V. Prelog in Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. EngI. , 5, 385,511 1966 . Due to the 2 asymmetric carbon atoms the piperidine moiety may be present in a cis and a trans form. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula I may be obtained by the application of art known procedures.Diastereoisomers may be separated by physical separation methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e. g., counter current distribution, and enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occur stereospecifically. In most compounds and starting materials the stereochemical configuration is not experimentally determined. In those cases it is conventionally agreed to designate the stereochemically isomeric form which is first isolated as A and the second as B , without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. The suffix p or c indicate the piperidine , respectively cyclohexyl moiety the stereochemical notation is related to. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula I are naturally intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention. A large number of intermediates and starting materials in the foregoing preparations are known compounds and all of them may be prepared according to art known methodologies of preparing similar compounds. A number of such preparation methods will be described hereafter in somewhat more detail. The intermediates of formula II may be prepared by a Michael addition reaction of an appropriate arylacetonitrile XII with a propenoic acid ester XIE , wherein R represents an optionally substituted lower alkyl radical, and subsequent hydrolysis of the thus obtained cyclic Michael addition reaction product in acidic medium.EMI14.1 Said Michael addition reaction is conveniently conducted by stirring and, ii desired, heating the reactants together in a suitable solvent such as, for example, an alkanol, e.g. , ethanol, 1,1 dimethylethanol and the like an aliphatic , ali cyclic or aromatic hydrocarbon,, e.g., n hexane, cyclohexane, methylbenzene and the like in the presence of an appropriate strong base, e.g., sodium hydride, sodium methoxide and the like, depending upon the solvent used. Preferably the reaction is conducted at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The hydrolysis is generally carried out by stirring and heating theMichael addition reaction product in aqueous acidic medium, e.g., aqueous hydrochloric acid and the like. The intermediates of formula V may be prepared by converting the hydroxy function of an appropriately substituted cyclohexarol XIV into an appropriate reactive leaving group W.EMI15.1 Said conversion of the hydroxylfunction into a leaving group W may, for example, be carried out by stirring the alcohol XIV with an appropriate halogenating or sulfonylatin, agent, e.g., thionyl chloride, methanesulfonyl chloride and the like. In order to neutralize the acid which is liberated during the course of the reaction it may be appropriate to add an appropriate base to the reaction mixture or to carry out the reaction in a suitable alkaline organic solvent, e. g. , pyridine and the like. The cyclohexanol XIV can be derived from the corresponding cyclohexanone II following art known reducing procedures. Depending upon the nature of R the intermediates II and V can be converted into each other following art known procedures of functio nal group transformation, as illustrated in scheme 1.In some cases it may be advantageous that, before the functional group transformation is carried out, other functions, which are present in the starting in termediate, are protected and that, afterwards, the protective groups are eliminated. A number of intermediates of formula III are described in U.S.PatentNos. 3,929,801 and 3,155,670 and in Helv. Chim.

The compounds of formula I , their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and the geometrically isomeric forms thereof possess strong psychotropic and antiemetic activity. Such psychotropic and anti emetic activity is evidenced by the experimental data obtained in at least one of two different test procedures, viz., the combined apomorphine , tryptamine and norepinephrine tests in rats and the apomorpnine test in dogs. The tests were carried out following the procedures described hereafter and the experimental data which were obtained are summarized in the tables 1, 2 and 3. I. The combined apomorphine APO , tryptamine TRY and norepinephrine NOR test in rats. The experimental animals used in this test were adult zzle Wistar rats weight 240 . lOg . After an overnight fast, the animals were treated subcutaneously 1 ml 100g with an aqueous solution of the compound under investigation time zero and put in isolated ob servation cages. Thirty minutes thereafter time 30 minutes 1,25 mg kg of apomorphine hydrochloride APO was injected intra venously and the rats were observed over a 1 hour period for the presence or absence of the following apomorphine induced phenomena agitation and stereotypic chewing.At the end of this 1 hour period tirne 90 minutes the same animals were injected intravenously with 40 mg kg of tryptamine TRY and the presence of the typical tryptamine induced bilateral tonic seizures was noted. Two hours after pretreatment time 120 minutes finally, the same animals were challenged with 1. 25 mg kg intravenously of norephinephrine NOR and possible mortality was looked for up to 60 minutes later.
