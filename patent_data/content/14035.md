# Process for the surface treatment of aluminium articles.

## Abstract
A process for surface treating an aluminium article comprises anodically oxidizing the article and dipping the anodically oxidized article in a polymer latex. To render the polymer coating layer this formed water insoluble, the polymer latex is prepared by polymerizing one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers in such a manner that polymer particles of the polymer latex are negatively char ged, the polymer latex being adjusted to a pH value be low 3.
