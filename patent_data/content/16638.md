# Eddy current mapping probe and method of operating same.

## Abstract
An eddy current probe for mapping holes within a tube sheet of a steam generator. As shown in Figure 1 a first coil 12 is positioned at the top of the probe 10 with its axis coincident with the axis of the probe. A first pair of coils 14 and 16 is arranged along a common axis perpendicular to the axis of the probe below the first coil 12 and are situated a distance from and on either side of the axis of the probe. A second pair of eddy current coils 18 and 20 is positioned along a common axis perpendicular to a plane including the axis of the probe and the axis of the first coil pair with the respective coils of the second pair located on either side of and spaced from the probe axis. Each of the respective coils is arranged to be separately excited by an alternating current source with the respective coil pairs coupled in opposition in corresponding balanced bridge arrangements. Means are provided for indicating a variation in the impedance of the first coil and an imbalance in either of the separate bridge arrangements of the first and second coil pairs.
