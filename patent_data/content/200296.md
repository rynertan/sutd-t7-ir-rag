## Description
This invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for applying to a substrate surface a two part curing composition such as a two part adhesive composition . In a two part curing composition, the two parts must be well mixed together in order that the mixture may then cure. Cure should take place only on a substrate surface or between substrates, but the mixture of parts, once made, will normally cure anywhere, e.g. in and on the mixing apparatus, in and on the applying devices, on the worktop, on the workpiece elsewhere than the intended application area, on the operater s hands and clothing. Unwanted curing is an inconvenience and can be a hazard when the composition is a rapid curing one, these disadvantages become worse, as they do for example with two part acrylic compositions. Nevertheless two part acrylic curing compositions have other advantages, especially in space filling, so that there is a great potential for their use if the said disadvantages could be overcome. It is known to apply two part curing compositions by means of a dispensing head which incorporates a static mixer, e.g. an elongated tube into one end of which appropriate proportions of both parts are fed under pressure and repeatedly deflected by stationary baffles to produce mixing of the parts before extrusion at the other end of the tube. This method is attended by numerous disadvantages. Thus high pressures are necessary to overcome the flow resistance of the baffles. Disposable mixing heads are often necessary. Much time is expended in cleaning down the equipment between working sessions. Pots of mixed composition have to be emptied within a working session to avoid excessive waste. Alternatively pieces of apparatus, such as dispensing heads, may be rinsed and stored in solvents, or solvents may be recirculated through mixing and pumping machinery between working sessions. All in all, the use of static and even dynamic mixing with two part curing compositions is so troublesome that there is considerable user resistance, especially to the use of the more quickly setting compositions. Nevertheless quick setting and gap filling two part compositions, such as acrylate compositions, have so many advantages and possible areas of application that it is possible to identify here a large need which is not being met in practice. It has also been known to apply a two part curing com position bead on bead , i.e., in the form of two separate parallel beads onto one substrate from two respective adjacent nozzles in a single pass. The beads commonly have diameters of 1 20mm and are applied one on top of the other or adjacent to each other with separations of 1 2 to a few mm so that on settling the beads come in contact with each other. Mixing of the two parts is accomplished when the substrate parts are pressed together, often with some relative lateral movement, the mixing occurring as the adhesive is squeezed out. In practical application of the bead on bead technique, the parallel nozzles are typically spaced a predetermined distance from each other, tapered and manufactured of a readily cut plastic material such as polyethylene or any other thermoplastic. The taper allows the nozzles to be cut to a desired diameter so that sufficient adhesive is dispensed in a single pass to cover the full bond width when squeezed out. In a typical appli cation where a metal reinforcer is bonded to a sheet metal substrate, the reinforcer width and consequently the desired bond width is often as wide as 2 8cm. In these kinds of applications, the bead on bead technique does not always give adequate mixing of the adhesive, at least at gaps of greater than 2 mm. In sheet metal bonding applications, because of the flexibility and dentability of the sheet substrate, gaps of 2 5mm are not uncommon. Therefore, there exists a need for an improved application method and device which would permit a single pass application of a two part adhesive and give essentially complete on part mixing even when extruded to widths of 2 8cm at bond gaps of up to 5mm or more. The invention accordingly provides, in a first aspect, an improved method for bonding a pair of substrates with a curing composition consisting of two parts A and B, which method comprises extruding onto one substrate a sufficient quantity of the A and B compositions in a single pass to cover the entire bond width when squeezed out by application of the second substrate and applying the second substrate, wherein the improve ment comprises that the components A and B are each extruded as a plurality of beads in alternating adjacent A B A B fashion. The alternating beads may be adjacent on the substrate or piled bead on bead or both. In the second aspect, the invention provides apparatus for applying to a substrate surface a curing composition consisting of two parts A and B, which apparatus comprises a dispensing head having a first and second extruding nozzle, each nozzle including a plurality of orifices means for feeding parts and A and B separately from respective reservoirs to the dispensing head and then to the nozzles of the first and second set respectively, the disposition of the nozzles in the dispensing head being such as to produce, on simultaneous extrusion of parts A and B through the respective first and second nozzle orifices onto a substrate surface in an extended pass, a web of composition consisting of discrete beads alternating in A B A B fashion. The inventive method and its preferred embodiments not only provides an improvement in bond strength over single bead on bead application, but surprisingly provides equivalent or better bond strengths than when the same product is dispensed through a static mixer head. These bond strength advantages are easily realized in single pass applications for bond widths of 2 8cm or more and gaps of 2 to 5mm or more. Although the invention may be employed with any two part curable adhesive or sealant system having two components of similar rheology which are activated by mixing just before application, it is preferred that the invention be used with matched resin acrylic systems such as those described in German published application Offen legunsschrift DE 33 20 918, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. These systems typically have very fast gel times making bulk mixing especially unsuitable. Examples of other systems which may be usefully employed include epoxy amine and epoxy mercaptan systems, and polyisocyanate polyol or polyiso cyanate polyamine systems. Referring now to the drawings, extruded beads of curing composition and extrusion nozzle orifices are represented as circles when they comprise or pertain to part A of the composition, and are represented as diamonds when they comprise or pertain to part B thereof. It will be appreciated that all the extrusion orifices and the beads on extrusion will usually have circular cross sections. Beginning with Figure 1, a dispensing head 1 comprises a three bore nozzle 2, a three bore nozzle 3, and a connector 4 adapted for attachment to conventional adhesive dispensing equipment supplying nozzle 2 with part A and nozzle 3 with part B of a two part acrylic adhesive composition. Nozzles 2,3 have respective rectangular orifice bearing faces 5,6 with dispensing orifices, 7,8. When the faces 5,6 are aligned as shown in Figure 2 the orifices 7 are stag gered with respect to the orifices 8. Accordingly, extrusion of part A of the composition through nozzle 2 and simultaneous extrusion of part B through nozzle 3, with the dispensing head being passed over a substrate surface 9, yields a deposited web of composition consisting of beads 10 of part A and beads 11 of part B alternating in ABAB fashion across the width of the web. In Figures 3 and 4 is shown a dispensing head 1 compris ing a single application tube 13 having six bores with three part A orifices 7 and three part B orifices 8, and a connector 4 adapted for attachment to adhesive dispensing equipment to supply orifices 7 with part A and orifices 8 with part B of the composition. The orifices 7,8 are spaced apart around the periphery of a circular orifice bearing face 5a. With suitable orientation of the dispensing head as shown, there is obtained a deposited web of composition consisting of beads 10 of part A and beads 11 of part B alternating in ABAB fashion across the width of the web, on a sub strate surface 9. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate an applicator 14 comprising a first multiple nozzle 16 of L shaped cross section which fits into a shaft or channel of similar cross section in a second multiple nozzle 15. The assembled nozzles 15,16 are adapted by means of a connector 4 for connection to a source of parts A and B respectively of an acrylic cure composition. Use of the application 14 for extrusion onto a substrate surface 9 gives a multi layer web 19 wherein the beads alternate in ABAB fashion across both the width and the thickness of the web. In the use of the apparatus and performances of the method of the invention, the beads of the applied web relax and begin to coalesce under the combined effects of their own weight and fluidity. The mixing process is completed by application of a second substrate on top of the deposited web with pressure. The dispensing heads have no contact with the mixed parts of the compo sition and can be cleaned with a stroke of a cloth, picked up many hours later and used again without any problem in the removal of set adhesive. The surprising improvements in bond strengths and gap filling capability of two part adhesives dispensed in the inventive manner are illustrated by the following non limiting example.
