## Description
This invention relates to high level microbial production of swine growth hormone through recombinant DNA technology. This high level production is achieved through high density fermentation of transformant Swine growth hormone SGH is a protein of 190 amino acids, which is initially synthesized in the anterior pituitary gland as a precursor pre growth hormone having 26 additional amino acids attached at the N terminus. This 26 amino acid signal sequence is processed off during secretion from the pituitary cells, yielding the mature hormone. It has been demonstrated that administration of SGH, purified from pituitary glands, to pigs results in increased growth rates, improved feed to animal weight conversion, improved meat quality in terms of nutritional content, and improved carcass quality in terms of increased length and reduced backfat. See, for example, European Patent Application Publication No. 0 104 920. The potential economic value of this hormone sparked interest in obtaining SGH in commercial quantities at reasonable cost. Thus, much work in recent years has focused on obtaining microbial synthesis of this commercially valuable hormone using recombinant DNA technology. Gene cloning and manipulation techniques well known in the art have been used to produce recombinant expression vectors containing SGH encoding cDNA fused to regulatory regions capable of directing synthesis of SGH in the desired host cells. Microorganisms transformed with these expression vectors have been shown to produce the desired hormone. For example, the cloning of SGH specific cDNA and construction of expression vectors therefrom is described in European Patent Application Publication No. 0 104 920 hereinafter referred to as EPO 0 104 920 . The highest yield of SGH reported in this publication, 32 mg liter, was achieved in small scale cultures of Obtaining maximal expression levels of the protein products of cloned genes often involves some trial and error. The genes may be fused to several different regulatory regions and or transformed into several host cell strains for comparative analyses to find the transformed strain giving the highest production levels of the desired protein. To date, efforts at yield improvement of microbially produced growth hormones have been carried out primarily at the level of genetic manipulations designed to increase cellular expression. There is still a need for the development of commercial scale fermentation processes capable of producing growth hormones in the highest possible yields. The present invention provides a method of producing at high levels a protein having SGH activity by fermentation of This method of producing a protein having SGH activity comprises the steps of By lowering the temperature of the fermentation medium to about 38 C to 41 C after inactivation of the λc1857 repressor protein synthesized during the initial growth period, cell growth is optimized while substantial production of active λc1857 repressor protein continues to be prevented and thereby the yield of the desired protein having swine growth hormone activity is improved. Figure 1 is a representation of the salient features of plasmid P Figure 2 is a representation of the salient features of plasmid pc1857, which encodes the λc1857 temperature sensitive repressor used to control SGH production in a method of the invention. Hereinafter, unless otherwise indicated, the terms SGH and swine growth hormone should be understood to refer to any protein having swine growth hormone activity. In a method according to the present invention employing a transformant Advantageously, the plasmid also carries a gene encoding a selectable marker, e.g., an antibiotic resistance gene, for selection of cells transformed by the plasmid. The transformant strain employed in the method of the invention also contains a λcI857 repressor gene. The repressor protein encoded by this temperature sensitive mutant gene is known to interact with the operators of phage This repressor protein has been used to regulate synthesis of desired proteins encoded by recombinant vectors in various transformant strains. For example, C. Queen The The host cells may be any transformable A preferred transformant strain for use in a method of the invention is Plasmid P Plasmid pcI857, shown in Figure 2, is a multicopy plasmid which encodes the λcI857 temperature sensitive repressor and also carries a kanamycin resistance gene. The transformant strain is used to inoculate an aqueous medium contained in a fermentor. The aqueous fermentation medium can be any medium suitable for supporting high density growth of Any conventional fermentation equipment known in the art can be used, provided there are means of controlling the medium temperature, of agitating and aerating the medium, and of adding oxygen to the intake air. The fermentor is inoculated with a culture of the transformant strain. Advantageously, the culture will have been previously incubated at 30 C for between 8 and 24 hours, preferably between 16 to 20 hours, or until the A₅₅₀, i.e., the absorbance at 550 nanometers of the culture, is between 2 and 42, preferably above 30 with agitation, for example, at 300 rpm. The culture can be grown in any suitable medium, for example, the ESM 1 and ESM 2 media described below or Luria broth, with ESM 2 media being preferred. The volume of culture used to inoculate the fermentor is between 1 500th and 1 25th, preferably about 1 50th of the volume of medium contained in the fermentor. In the method of the invention, the fermentation is conducted in two phases. Following inoculation of the fermentation medium with the transformant strain, an initial growth period is conducted during which the level of dissolved oxygen in the medium is maintained at from about 20 to 60 saturation. The dissolved oxygen level decreases as cell density begins to increase rapidly, but is preferably kept above 20 saturation. This may be accomplished by feeding ambient air into the fermentor at a rate sufficient to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration at the desired level, while also agitating the fermentation medium by any suitable mechanical means. Feeding ambient air at a rate of about 0.8 to 1.2, preferably about 1.0, volume of air STP per volume of liquid per minute with agitation at 800 to 1200 rpm, preferably about 1000 rpm, is suitable. The agitator is driven by a motor which preferably provides a power input of about 0.5 to 1.5 horsepower per 100 gallons of fermentation medium. The temperature of the medium during the initial growth period is any temperature at which Alternatively, the temperature may first be held at about 28 C to 30 C for a portion of the initial growth period, for example, the first 13 hours, and may then be raised gradually to about 35 C during the remainder of the initial growth period. The initial growth period is continued until cell density as measured by the A₅₅₀ of a sample of culture from the fermentor reaches about 20 to 40, which commonly occurs at about 16 to 24 hours after inoculation of the fermentation medium. Good results may also be obtained by continuing the initial growth period until the A₅₅₀ reaches about 60. During this extended growth period , the temperature may be gradually raised to 35 C, as described above, or nutrients may be added, as described below. Addition of nutrients may increase the rate of cell growth so that an A₅₅₀ of about 60 can be reached in about 16 hours. At this point, the second fermentation phase, an induction period, is begun. The temperature of the fermentation medium is raised to at least about 42 C preferably 42 C and held there for about one hour, thereby inactivating the λcI857 repressor protein and inducing production of SGH in the transformant strain. The temperature is then reduced to about 38 C to 41 C, preferably about 40 C. At this temperature, the cI857 repressor protein is inactive,but conditions are more favorable for The dissolved oxygen level in the medium is maintained at from about 10 to 40 , preferably above about 20 , of saturation during the induction period. Any suitable means of aeration and agitation can be used to maintain this dissolved oxygen level. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, ambient air is fed at a rate of about 0.8 to 1.2, preferably about 1.0, volumes of air STP per volume of liquid per minute, and the medium is agitated at about 800 to 1200 rpm, preferably about 1200 rpm. The agitator is driven by a motor which preferably provides a power input of about 0.99 to 2.97 watts per litre 0.5 to 1.5 horsepower per 100 gallons of fermentation medium. Since the rate of oxygen consumption is increased during the induction period, it is preferred to supplement the oxygen present in the ambient air source by feeding oxygen into the fermentor in order to maintain the desired dissolved oxygen level. Any conventional means of providing oxygen to the fermentation medium may be employed. For example, a sparger which is connected to an oxygen source may be inserted directly into the medium or oxygen may be added to the ambient air being fed into the fermentor. The induction period is generally continued until the A₅₅₀ reaches about 80 to 155, preferably 118 to 153. These cell densities are commonly reached at about 8 to 12 hours after the start of the induction period i.e, after raising the temperature to 42 C or above . Fermentation parameters indicating that SGH synthesis and cell growth are complete include 1 a significant decrease in oxygen demand, 2 no further increase in cell density A₅₅₀ values , and 3 NaOH utilization for pH control stops. Nutrients which are depleted from the fermentation medium during cell growth are replenished by any of the methods known in the art. Nutrients may be fed continually or in portions during the fermentation. Preferably, nutrients are added in portions, as needed. A portion of nutrients may be added at the time of induction of SGH synthesis i.e., when the temperature is raised to 42 C or above , and at least once, preferably twice, during the induction period. For example, when induction is effected at an A₅₅₀ between about 20 and 40, a first portion of nutrients may be added at the time of induction and a second portion of nutrients may be added about 5 hours post induction when the A₅₅₀ is between about 80 and 90 . Alternatively, a first portion of nutrients may be added at the time of induction when the A₅₅₀ is between about 20 and 40 , a second portion of nutrients may be added about 4 hours post induction when the A₅₅₀ is between about 70 and 80 and a third portion of nutrients may be added about 6 hours post induction when the A₅₅₀ is between about 90 and 100 . Excellent results also may be obtained by adding a first portion of nutrients during the initial growth period, for example, at an A₅₅₀ of about 30 or about 13 hours post inoculation and continuing the initial growth period until the A₅₅₀ reaches about 60. A second portion of nutrients is given at the time of induction when the A₅₅₀ is about 60, which may be achieved by about 16 hours post inoculation . Nutrients may then be added in portions once, or preferably twice, during the induction period, as described above. The nutrients to be added will depend on the composition of the fermentation medium chosen. In general, the nutrients to be added may comprise the carbon source s and the nitrogen source s present in the fermentation medium into which the transformant strain was inoculated. In one embodiment of the invention, NZ Amine A and glycerol are the nutrients added in portions. In another embodiment of the invention wherein the fermentation medium contains corn gluten hydrolysate, the nutrients added in portions comprise NZ Amine A, glycerol, and corn gluten hydrolysate, as described below. The SGH produced by the transformant strain may be recovered by any suitable means known in the art. Cells may be harvested from the fermentation medium by, for example, centrifugation. Cells are then lysed by enzymatic, chemical or mechanical means, for example, using sonication, a French press, a homogenizer or treatment with such agents as lysozyme and detergents such as Triton X 100. SGH may be purified from the cell lysate by any suitable protein purification method, including affinity chromatography, selective precipitation from a solution of a salt such as ammonium sulfate, ion exchange chromatography, isoelectric focusing, or any combination of methods. Using the fermentation process of the invention, yields of 7.2 to 10.7 grams per liter of The method of the invention is described more fully in the examples which follow. The examples are provided to further illustrate the method of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Samples of The inoculum for a 9 liter fermentor charge was obtained by adding the cells to 200 ml of either ESM 1 or ESM 2 medium contained in a 500 ml flask. The pH of the medium was adjusted to a value of 6.8 7.0 and the medium contained about 25 µg ml each of ampicillin and kanamycin. The flask was closed with two milk filters so that some aeration of the medium could take place while the flask was shaken at 300 rpm for 16 20 hours at 30 C in a New Brunswick Rotary Shaker. The fermentor was a New Brunswick Microgen with a total volume of 16 liters. Nine liters of liquid medium was initially charged to the fermentor plus 180 ml of inoculum. The composition of the initial 9 liters of medium is shown below The medium was sterilized for 20 minutes at 121 C and the pH was adjusted to 6.8 with NaOH. The pH was maintained by additions of NaOH, as necessary, during fermentation. To the medium 250 mg each of ampicillin and kanamycin were added. The solution of antibiotics was sterilized by filtration. Dissolved oxygen DO concentration was constantly monitored throughout the fermentation with a galvanic probe connected to a strip recorder. During induction, DO was maintained at 10 40 saturation 1 4 ppm by enriching the inlet air with oxygen gas. A gas tank equipped with an oxygen regulator was used to control the flow of oxygen into the inlet air. After the gases were mixed, the oxygen enriched air was filtered and entered the fermentor vessel through a sparger. At the time of induction A₅₅₀ 37 , i.e., when the temperature was raised to 42 C, nutrients were added to the fermentation medium. 250 g NZ Amine A and 200 g glycerol in approximately one liter water, were added. An additional feeding of 100 g NZ Amine A and 100 g of glycerol was given 5 hours post induction A₅₅₀ 84 . The operating conditions that gave us our best results are set forth in this section. For HPLC analysis, fermentor broth samples were collected by centrifugation 10 15,000 X g, 15 min. and bacteria were resuspended in 4 5 volumes of buffered guanidine 8M guanidine HCl, 100 mM glycine NaOH buffer, pH 9.8, 5 mM reduced glutathione . The suspension was allowed to sit for 20 30 min. and was then homogenized for 15 20 seconds with a model SDT 1810 Tek Mar tissue mizer. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation as above and the clarified SGH extract was assayed by HPLC. Some extracts were diluted 1 2 with guanidine buffer before HPLC assay. The procedures of Example I were followed, with the exception of steps C and D. Alternative procedures for steps C and D, and the results, are given below At induction A₅₅₀ 30 , 125 g NZ Amine A, 975 ml of corn gluten hydrolysate and 200 g of glycerol were added. Additional feedings of 50 g of NZ Amine A, 390 ml corn gluten hydrolysate and 100 g glycerol were added at 4 hours A₅₅₀ 74 and 6 A₅₅₀ 95 hours post induction.
