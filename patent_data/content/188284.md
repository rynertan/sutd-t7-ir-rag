# Rear suspension controller.

## Abstract
A new rear suspension controller is invented for impro ving a ride comfort or for improving controllability and stability when a vehicle passes a sporadic bump or dip of otherwise smooth road surface. It includes a front vehicle height detector which measures a distance between the vehicle body and a front wheel a first judgment means which detects a sporadic bump or dip by comparing the signal from the front vehicle height detector with a preset standard value a rear vehicle height detector which mea sures a distance between the vehicle body and a rear wheel a second judgment means which detects the bump or dip that the front wheel has passed and a rear suspension characteristic alteration means which alters, for example, a spring constant of air suspensions, a dumping force of shock absorbers, stabilizer compliance, etc. when the first judg ment means detected the bump or dip and returns the characteristic after the second judgment means judges that the rear wheel has passed it.
