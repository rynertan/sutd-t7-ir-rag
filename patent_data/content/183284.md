# Arc furnace burner control method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An electric arc furnace having at least one electrode and a burner and first and second supply systems for respect ively supplying an oxygen containing gas and fuel to the burner. An exhaust gas conduit is connected to the furnace and includes a first damper for controlling the flow rate of exhaust gases and a second damper for controlling the flow of dilution air into the exhaust conduit. First and second position sensors are coupled to the first and second dam pers, respectively, for sensing the positions thereof, a temperature sensor is coupled to the exhaust conduit for sensing the temperature therein and a pressure sensor is coupled to the furnace for sensing the furnace pressure. A first control is coupled to the first supply system and to the temperature sensor and to the first position sensor for initiating and controlling the flow of fuel in relation to the flow rate of oxygen containing gas, the position of the second damper and the pressure within the furnace.
