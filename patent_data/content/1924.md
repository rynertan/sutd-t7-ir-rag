## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOS IT ION FOR ADMINISTERING CHOLINE This invention relates to a composition for the administration of choline, or natural or synthetic compounds that dissociate to form choline, along with a drug, in order to treat human disorders by increasing acetylcholine levels in brain and other tissues. There are a number of diseases which affect acetylcholine containing neurons in the brain or other tissues, and which are treated by drugs that cause undesired side effects by diminishing acetylcholine release there also exist diseases now treated by other drugs in which the potency and or efficacy of the drugs could be improved by combining them with choline or natural or synthetic compounds that dissociate to form choline in order thereby to enchance the release of acetylcholine. Such diseases include both those primarily involving the brain eg. diseases of higher cortical functions psychiatric illnesses movement disorders and those involving the peripheral nervous system eg. neuromuscular disorders .Tardive dyskinesia is a particularly common movement disorder associated with inadequate release of brain acetylcholine as a result of drug administration for the initial brain disease e.g psychosis . Tardive dyskinesia is a choreic movement disorder characterized by involuntary twitches in the tongue, lips, jaw and extremities. It typically occurs in susceptible persons after chronic injestion of neuroleptic drugs and may involve an imbalance in the postulated reciprocal relation between dopaminergic and choliergic neurons in the basal ganglion.Thus, drugs that either block catecholamine synthesis eg.alpha methyl p tyrosine , deplete the brain of monoamines e.g, reserpine, tetrabenazine or antagonize dopamine s actions on synaptic receptors e.g, pherothiazines, haloperidol often suppress tardive dyskinesia, whereas drugs that indirectly stimulate dopamine receptors e.g, amphetamine, levodopa often exacerbate the abnormal movements.Drugs assumed to increase the amount of acetylcholine within brain synapses e.g, physostigmine, deanol , also tend to suppress the chorea of tardive dyskinesia, whereas anticholinergics e.g, scopolamine , make it worse. We have shown that choline administered by injection or by dietary supplementation increases blood choline levels in the rat this, in turn, increases choline levels in cholinergic neurons within the brain and elsewhere in the body, thereby accelerating the synthesis of acetylcholine, increasing tissue acetylcholine levels, and increasing the amounts of acetylcholine released into brain synapses. In human beings, oral doses of choline or of lecithin, a naturally occurring compound that dissociates to choline were found to cause dose related increases in blood choline levels of sufficient magnitude based on the studies on rats to enhance brain acetylcholine synthesis and release choline levels in the cerebrospinal fluid also rose in parallel.It has also been reported in four human patients that the administration of choline decreased the choreiform movements of tardive dyskinesia no data were provided as to whether or not the drug given concurrently for psychosis haloperidol, 3 mg per day continued to be effective during the brief period of choline administration, and it was concluded that the apparent effectiveness of choline had to be interpreted with caution, since ...all four patients with tardive dyskinesia could have been gradually improving during the study since this disease is characterized by extreme variability of clinical course.Thus, prior to our invention, it had not been known that the concomitant administration of choline or of a natural or synthetic compound that dissociates to form choline along with an anti psychotic drug that causes tardive dykinesia as a side effect could significantly reduce or prevent the onset of tardive dyskinesia, without blocking the effectiveness of the drug in treating psychosis. This invention is based upon the discovery that choline or a physiologically acceptable natural or synthetic compound that dissociates to form choline, when administered concomitantly with a drug, can, by increasing neuronal ace tylcholine levels, 1 reduce or prevent undesirable side effects of the drug associated with inadequate acetylcholine release, and or 2 potentiate the effectiveness of the drug.The choline and drug may be administered orally such as in tablet, capsule or liquid form or parenterally by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. This invention is useful even with patients having a prior history of the undesirable side effect or of suboptimal therapeutic response or of therapeutic responses requiring a very large drug dose, but who continue taking the drug. In accordance with this invention, choline or a compound that dissociates to form choline is orally administered to a patient prior to or together with a drug in order to increase blood levels of choline, and thereby to increase the level of acetylcholine in the brain. The acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl CoA in a reaction catalyzed by choline acethyltransterase CAT . It has been found that the administration of choline or a compound that dissociates to form choline potentiates the drug by reducing the incidence or suppressing side effects of the primary drug and or that lower dosages of the primary drug are needed to attain the desired effects of the drug.While the results obtained will vary from patient to patient, the reduced side effects and increased efficacy observed are sufficiently significant as to justify the conclusion that their reduction is caused by administration of choline or a compound that dissociates to form choline. There are a number of brain and peripheral diseases involving cholinergic neurons that are presently treated with drugs that are only sometimes effect, or that require very large doses of the drugs with correspond ingly greater cost and incidence of side effects soe of these diseases can be more effectively treated by comb z combining the existing drug therapy with concomitant choline or natural or synthetic compounds that dissociate to for choline.One example is the mania phases of manicdepressive psychosis, which is currently treated with lithium saltsThese salts, as a biochemical side effect, interfere both the uptake of choline into the brain this tends to raze brain acetylcholine levels, which exacerbates the rnar The co administration of choline with the lithium salts would allow more effective treatment of the mania, and a reduction in the lithium dose needed by most patients. Another example is myasthenia gravis, a peripheral disease involving the cholinergic nerves that innervate skeletal muscle. The current mode of treatment involves giving drugs like neostigmine Prostigmin that increase acetylcholine levels in neuromuscular synapses by blocking the degradation of this neurotransmitter. Were choline or a natural or synthetic compound that dissociates to form choline to be given concomitantly with the cholinesterase inhibitor, the resulting increases in acetylcholine levels would both potentiate the effect of the cholinesterase inhibitor and allow for a reduction in its dose. Some of the drugs utilized in the present invention are those which cause significant undesirable effects. Representative of such drugs are neuroleptics, such as R R chlorpromazine THORAZINE and haloperidol HALDOL that are used in the tretment of such diseases as schizophrenia, Huntington s disease and Tourette s syndrome.Other drugs that cause undesired effects include psychomotor stimulente such as amphetamine DEXADRINE R and methylphenidate RITALINE t that are used to treat patients with minimal brain dysfunction, hyperactivity and specific dyslexias. The effects of some other drugs utilized in this invention are potentiated. Representative of such drugs are 1 isoxsuprine VASODILAN R and dihydroergotamines HYDERGINE that are used in the treatment of senility R 2 gluco corticosteroids such as triamcinotone ARISTOCORT and predinsone METICORTEN R and anti cholinesteras drugs such as neostigmine PROSTIGMIN R and pyridostigmine that are used to treat neuromuscular diseases, including polynigositis and myasthenia gravis 3 lithium SKALITH that is used to treat manic depressive illness and 4 tranquillizers such as phenobarbitol LVMINAL R and R diazepam VALIUM that are used to treat anxiety psychoneurosis. The choline can be administered as choline salts, such as the chloride bitartrate or the like, or as a compound that dissociated to choline, such as lecithin, lysolecithin, glycerophosphatidyl choline, synthetic compounds, mixtures thereof or the like. It is preferred to employ lecithin or lecithin analogs as the choline source since it is not degraded in the gut in contrast to choline. The choline or compound that dissociates to choline is administered so that a choline level of at least about 20 30 nanomoles m and usually between about 10 and 50 n moles ml is attained in the patient s blood stream. For example, when administ ering choline chloride in the form of capsules o tablets, suitable dosages are from about 1 to 30 g day, preferably 8 20 g day taken in divided doses 500 to 1000 mg cap or tab.When choline chloride is administered in liquid form ad mixed with a conventional liquid carrier such as a sweetened elixir.or the like, from about 1 to 10 gratrts l5 m, preferably from about 2 to 5 g 15 ml can be utilized, when utilizing lecithin in a liquid carrier, it is administered in amounts of between about 0.1 and 50 g day. then lecithin is administered in granular form as a tablet or in a capsule, it is employed in amounts of between about 0.1 and lOo g day usually between about 30 and 50 g day. Normally, lecithin is not available as a pure compound and is available in admixture with other phospholipids wherein the lecithin com prises about 20 30 weight percent of the mixture. In the process of this invention, the choline or compound that dissociates to choline is administered prior to or concomitantly with the drug. IVen administered prior to the drug, the period of time between choline administration and drug administeration must be less than hen acetyl choline concentration reduction begins to occur in the brain. Generally, the period of time between administrations is less than about 36 hours, preferably less than bout 24 hours. The following example illustrates the present invention and is not intended to limit the same.EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates that choline signifi cantle reduces tardive dyskinesia in patients taking antipsychotic drugs. 20 subjects were selected at random from a large group of inpatients with stable chronic buccal lingualmasticatory dyskinesia. Each patient had received phenothiazines or haloperidol in the past, and 13 were still taking such drugs when the study began Table I . Anticholinergic medications benztropin or trihexyphenidyl were discontinued during the study, but the doses of all other medications, including neuroleptics, were unchanged. The severity of the chorea was illustrated by counting the number of eye blinks, tongue protrusions, slow tongue movements inside the mouth, jaw closures, or lip movements visible during a 30 second interval. Each patient sat in a quiet privateroom with 3 observers, one of whom was present during all examinations. Two observers counted the movements independently on two separate days before the. study began and made subsequent counts every three days there ter. The mean counts were tabulated during the control periods, the second week of choline and the second week of placebo ingestion and scored the percentage change as follows 25 to 25 per cent, no change i.e, falling within the anticipated day to day variation 25 to 50 per cent, moderately changed and 50 per cent, greatly changed. Choline chloride 15o mg per kilogram per day during the first week and 200 mg per kilogram per day during the second week was mixed in a sweet commercial beverage and dispensed in three daily divided doses. The placebo, sucrose octa acetate, was also dissolved in the beverage lo mg per liter and administered in the same manner and volume as the choline. Both solutions tasted bitter, but the placebo did not impart the fishy odor someties noted in patients who chronically ingest choline. Half the patients received choline, and the other half placebo, for two weeks these schedules were reversed after a 10 day interval during which neither choline nor placebo was dispensed. Blood samples for choline measurements were collected from every patient before the drug trial began and on three subsequent occasions during the second week of therapy, on the ninth day of the drug free interval and during the second week of the crossover period the final two wees of therapy . All blood samples were collected before breakfast. During the treatment periods, they were obtained one hour after the subjects ingested the beverage. Serum samples were separated, frozen and assayed for choline content by a conventional radioenzymatic method. The chemical characteristics of the 20 patients with tardive dyskinesia are set forth in Table I. TABLE ICase Age Sex Primary Severity current Dosage Diagnosis Tardive MedicationNo. yr.

During the second week of choline ingestion 200 mg per kilogram per day , plasma choline levels in blood obtained one hour after a choline dose increased in all patients and ranged between 18.2 and 60.1 nmol per milliliter 33.5 2.5, mean S.E.M., a 170 per cent increase P0.OOl by Student s t test .Plasma choline levels measured during placebo administration and at the end of the lo day washout period did not differ significantly from control levels. Buccal lingual masticatory movements lessened in nine patients during the period of choline administration five patients improved greatly, and four improved moderately Table II .TABLE IIClinical Effect of Choline Administration on the BuccalLinqual Masticatory Movements in 20 Patients with Tardive DyskinesiaClassification No. of Mean No. of Patients Movements Change 30 sec Before During Range Choline CholineGreatly Improved 5 12.6 4.2 74 84Moderately improved 4 21.2 11.7 41 55 Unchanged 10 13.4 13.6 18 21 Worsened 1 4.5 27.5 511 idicates mprovement and worsening of the chorea Case 1 had rapid, tremulous tongue movements, which virtually ceased during choline therapy. Cases 2 and 3 had slower, rolling tongue movements within the mouth these movements, too, were greatly suppressed rig choline treatment, but not during placebo administration. Tongue movements also decreased markedly, but not completely, in two patients with more severe dyskinesa. Case 4 protruded her tongue serpent s tongue 20 t mes per 30 seconds during the initial observation period. In the final week of choline thereapy, the rate decreased to five times per 30 seconds, although the tongue continued to roll in side her mouth. Placebo ingestion had no effect on the rate of tongue protrusions. Two weeks after she stopped taking choline, her tongue protrusions returned to the pretreatment rate of 20 per 30 seconds. WithIn a week of the beginning of a second course of choline treat ment 200 mg per kilogram per day , the rate of tongue protrusions again decreased to six times per 30 seconds. Case 5 protruded his tongue 20 to 30 times per 30 seconds during initial observations but did not protrude it at all during the second week of choline ingestion. It continued to move inside his mouth, but the movement frequency decreased by 49 per cent. Buccal lingual masticatory movements decreased moderately 25 to 50 per cent in another four subjects.Cases 6 and 7 had fewer jaw movements during choline ingestion, but their tongue motions did not change. The number of jaw movements also diminished during choline therapy in Case 8, although the frequency of her eye blinks did not change. Tongue and lip movements decreased during choline ingestion in Case 9, but jaw movementswereunaffected. The frequency of tongue movements increased markedly in Case 20 from four to 27 times per 30 per seconds during the period of choline ingestion, but returned to control counts when the choline was discontinued.Neither choline nor placebo altered buccal lingual masti catorymovements in the remaining 10 patients. Another patient with severe akathisia was included in the study she did not exhibit facial chorea, however, and is not listed in the tables. She was unable to sit still and moved her feet 30 times every 30 seconds. These movements were not altered during placebo ingestion but nearly ccased during choline administration. No serious side effects were encountered in any subject during the course of the study. Cases 2 and 3 were more withdrawn than usual and possibly depressed during choline treatment. Three patients Cases 4,7 and 15 experienced symptoms of mild cholinergic toxicity, including lacrimation, blurred vision, anorexia and diarrhea, while taking 200 mg of choline per kilogram per day. All the effects were dose related and subsided when the dosage was reduced. The 20 patients who participated in the study all exhibited permanent buccal lingual masticatory characteristic of tardive dyskinesia and all had taken neuroleptics in the past although these drugs had been di continued in seven patients before the study began . Most subjects were elderly women who had taken neuorleptics for many years the drugs and doses listed in Table I are minimal estimates. Since the onset of tardive dysS eei a was documented only in Case 13, it is possible that some patients in the series had senile chorea, or the manrerisms of mentally retarded or psychotic patients, and not true drug induced tardive dyskinesia. The variety of their responses to choline nine better, one worse and 10 unchanged suggests that the patient sample was indeed heterogeneous at least in the involvement of cholinergic mechanisms.This confusion about causes will remain a problem until an accurate diagnostic test for tardive dyskinesia is found. Most attempts to treat tardive dyskinesia are based on the theory that neuroleptic drugs, by blocing intrasynaptic dopamine receptors,.cause a reflex overactivity of dopaminergic neurons, which may be due to increased dopamine turnover or to denervation supersensitivity.Either action would excessively suppress striatal cholinergic neurons which receive inhibitory impulses from the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway at times of day when the blockade of dopamine receptors was incomplete. Although no therapy is completely satisfactory, numerous efforts to treat stable tardive dyskinesia have employed drugs thought to decrease the amount of dopamine released into central synapses. Other therapeutic strategies designed to increase cholinergic tome at the next synapse distal to that employing dopamine have had only limited success. Buccal lingual masticatory movements decreased in nine patients during the period of choline consumption, but were unaffected by the placebo. The occurrence of cholinergic side effects in three of the subjects provides additional indirect evidence that exogenous choline enhances neuronal acetylcholine synthesis and release in human beings and probably accounts for the suppression of chorea in the nine patients who improved during choline therapy. The buccal lingual masticatory movements of these patients were not sufficiently different from those displayed by the group as a whole to permit identification of particular movements that might be especially responsive to choline treatment. The mean blood choline levels both before and during treatment, in the patients who responded to choline did not differ significantly from the mean of the group as a whole in nine responders, 13.1 1.4 nmol per milliliter before and 31.5 2.5 during treatment, and in the entire group, 12.4 1.0 nmol per milliliter before and 33.5 2.5 during treatment nor did their age 63.3 years vs. 59.8 years sex predominatnly women , primary diagnosis predominantly schizophrenia , or concurrent neuroleptic medication Table I . Oral doses of lecithis, the major source of dietary choline, may be an alternate way to treat patients with tardive dyskinesia. We observe that lecithin administration, like that of free choline, elevates blood choline levels in human subjects.
