# A method for recovering the metal content of complex sulphidic metal raw materials.

## Abstract
The metal content of complex sulphidic metal raw material is recovered therefrom by means of an autogenous flame smelting process, preferably carried out in a vortex, with an oxygen containing gas. The raw materials are smelted in a furnace in the presence of an excess of oxygen and together with an addition of an acid slag former, such as silica, to form a melt which is rich in metal oxide silicate and poor in sulphur. Any metal phase formed in the furnace is separated from the silicate phase, and non iron metals present in the silicate phase are recovered therefrom by selective reduction.
