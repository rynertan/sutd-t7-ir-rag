# Halogenation process using a halide carrier and process for regeneration of the halide carrier.

## Abstract
A process for the manufacture of halogenated hy drocarbons which comprises contacting a hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon feedstock with a solution of a halide carrier to halogenate the feedstock whereby the halide carrier is reduced to a spent carrier and re generating the halide carrier by electrolysis of the spent carrier solution from the halogenation reaction by elec trolysing the spent carrier solution in the presence of halide ions under conditions whereby deposition of metal or metal salts and liberation of elemental halogen are substantially avoided. In particular embodiments, the feedstock is halogenated using a non aqueous solu tion of the halide carrier in which the ratio of halide ion metal ion of the halide carrier is below 2 1, prefer ably about 1 1 and regeneration of the halide carrier is carried out in a three compartment cell having two ion exchange membranes or a diaphragm and a membra ne. The halide carrier is a haiide salt of a metal of variable valency in which the metal is in a higher va lency state, especially cupric chloride or ferric chloride.
