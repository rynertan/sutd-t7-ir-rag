# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THIN STEEL PLATE FOR DRAWING WITH BAKING CURABILITY.

## Abstract
This method contemplates to obain a thin steel plate for drawing which has excellent press moldability, baking curability and dent resistance. A method of manufacturing a thin steel plate for drawing, which comprises the steps of heating to a temperature of 850 to 950 C in accordance with the effective Ti amount when continuously annealing a cold rolled steel plate containing 0.001 to 0.010 wt C, less than 1.0 wt Mn, less than 1.2 wt Si, less than 0.1 wt P and Ti in an effective amount obtained from 0.015 effective Ti amount wt 4 C wt 0.05, and then quenching the steel plate from 850 to 500 C.
