# Frequency synthesizing circuit.

## Abstract
In a frequency synthesizing circuit the deviation of the frequency of an oscillator signal which is transmitted at 7 by a measuring gate 79 from a desired frequency output 47 is converted into a control signal at 3 for the oscillator 11 . In order to prevent the occurrence of an average frequency deviation due to a continuous change of the phase relationship between a test pulse m controlling the measur ing gate 79 and the oscillator signal, an additional pulse output 83 or 85 is added via 81 to the output signal of the measuring gate 79 . This additional pulse must occur contiguous to the test pulse.
