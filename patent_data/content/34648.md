# A METHOD FOR THE ALKOXYLATION OF ALKANOLS IN THE PRESENCE OF STRONTIUM CONTAINING CATALYSTS AND PROMOTERS

## Abstract
Strontium containingl alkoxylation systems are used as catalysts for the alkoxylation of alcohols of all classes. The reaction is carried out at temperatures of from about 90 to about 260 C to yield an alkoxylation product. The products obtained have very narrow adduct distribution with low levels of by products and unreacted free alcohols. Several classes of materials which promote these reactions are disclosed.
