# Input circuit for producing discharge path to enhance operation.

## Abstract
A bipolar input circuit for regulating the current voltage level at a control electrode of an electronic component QA provides a capacitively controlled discharge path from the control electrode through a discharge transistor QC when an input signal V‚ÇÅ makes certain voltage transitions. The control electrode responds to the voltage at an emitter E1 of an input transistor element QB which has another emitter E2 coupled to the base of the discharge transistor. Its base is further coupled to a capacitor C which controls the discharge path.
