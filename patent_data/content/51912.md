# Apparatus for monitoring the topography of the internal surface of a pipe.

## Abstract
A pig 1 for monitoring the internal surface profile 7 of a pipeline carries a plurality of sensors 5 to trace the surface as the pig 1 traverses the pipeline. Output signals from the sensors 5 are compared with an expected value and a reference signal generated when they differ by more than a predetermined amount. The sensor signals are recorded simultaneously with the reference signal.
