# Tiltable support.

## Abstract
A low profile keyboard 10 is supported at the rear on two legs 12 mounted on pivots 13 . The legs are pivotally connected 24 to the ends of respective sliding links 19, 20 which are baised by a spring 26 to slide out relative to each other and thereby swing the legs 12 downwardly to increase the tilt of the keyboard. The links 19, 20 can be arrested at various degrees of tilt by engagement of a pin 38 on a button 32 in notches along the lower edges of the links.
