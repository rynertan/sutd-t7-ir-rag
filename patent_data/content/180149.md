These diimide diacids are useful in a number of applications and are particularly suitable for use in the preparation of polyetherimide esters and polyetherimide amides, which in turn may be used as adhesives, coating materials and molding and extrusion compositions. Diimide diesters are known. For example,Pruckmayr et al, U.S. Patent 3,461,136, discloses diimide diesters prepared by reacting an aryl ester of a tricarboxylic acid anhydride with a diamine.Suitable diamines include C2 C20 aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic diamines as well as diamines of a bridged organic radical wherein the bridge is among others sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, etc.These compounds may be used in the preparation of polyester imides and polyamide imides suitable for use as an impregnant and as a coating composition. Additionally, Kluiber, U.S. Patent 3,274,159 disclosed polyesterimides of trimellitic anhydride wherein a diimide diacid is reacted with a divalent alcohol. The diimide diacids of this polyimide ester are the reaction product of trimellitic anhydride and a diprimary diamine of the formula I H2N D NH2 wherein D is selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbon materials, including aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic radicals and hydrocarbon ether radicals which may contain up to five ether oxygen atoms.

It has now been found that novel high molecular weight diimide diacids and diimide diesters having the foregoing qualities may be prepared from polyoxyalkylene diamines and a tricarboxylic component containing two imide forming vicinal carboxyl groups or an anhydride group and an additional carboxyl group.These diimide diesters and diimide diacids may be prepared in accordance with known methods for the preparation of diimides from diamines and anhydrides. The polyoxylalkylene diamines suitable for use in the present invention may be characterized by the following formula II H2N G NH2 wherein G is the radical remaining after the removal of the hydroxy groups of a long chain ether glycol.These polyether diprimary diamines are available commercially from Texaco Chemical Company under the trademark Jeffamine. In general they are prepared by known process for the aminization of glycols. For example, they may be prepared by aminating the glycol in the presence of ammonia, Raney nickel catalyst and hydrogen as set forth in Belgium patent 634,741. Alternatively, they may be prepared by treating the glycol with ammonia and hydrogen over a Nickel Copper Chromium catalyst as taught by U.S. Patent 3,654,370. Other methods for the production thereof include as taught in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,155,728 and 3,236,895 andFrench Patent Nos. 1,551,605 and 1,466,708.EMI3.1 EMI3.2 The long chain ether glycols suitable for use in the manufacture of the polyoxyalkylene diamines are polymeric glycols having terminal or as nearly terminal as possible hydroxy groups and a molecular weight of from about 600 to about 12000. Additionally, the long chain ether glycols will have a carbon to oxygen ratio of from about 1.8 to about 4.3. Representative long chain ether glycols are poly ethylene ether glycol poly propylene ether glycol poly tetramethylene ether glycol random or block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, including propylene oxide terminated poly ethylene ether glycol and random or block copolymers of tetrahydrofuran with minor amounts of a second monomer such as methyl tetrahydrofuran used in proportion such that the carbon to oxygen mole ratio in the glycol does not exceed about 4.3 . Especially preferred poly alkylene ether glycols are poly propylene ether glycol and poly ethylene ether glycols end capped with poly propylene ether glycol and or propylene oxide. In general, the polyoxyalkylene diamines useful within the scope of the present invention will have an average molecular of from about 600 to 12000, preferably from about 900 to about 4000. The tricarboxylic component may be almost any carboxylic acid anhydride containing an additional carboxylic group or the corresponding acid thereof containing two imide forming vicinal carboxyl groups in lieu of the anhydride group. Mixtures thereof are also suitable. The additional carboxylic group must be esterifiable and preferably is substantially nonimidizable. While trimellitic anhdyride is preferred as the tricarboxylic component, any of a number of suitable tricarboxylic acid constituents will occur to those skilled in the art including 2,6,7 naphthalene tricarboxylic anhydride 3,3 ,4 diphenyl tricarboxylic anhydridei 3,3 ,4 benzophenone tricarboxylic anhydride 1,3,4 cyclopentane tricarboxylic anhydride 2,2 ,3 diphenyl tricarboxylic anhydride diphenyl sulfone 3,3 ,4 tricarboxylic anhydride, ethylene tricarboxylic anhydride 1,2,5 napthalene tricarboxylic anhydride 1,2,4 butane tricarboxylic anhydride diphenyl isopropylidene 3,3 , 4 tricarboxylic anhydride 3,4 dicarboxyphenyl 3 carboxylphenyl ether anhydride 1,3,4 cyclohexane tricarboxylic anhydride etc. These tricarboxylic acid materials can be characterized by the following formula EMI4.1 where R is a trivalent organic radical, preferably aC2 to C20 aliphatic, aromatic, or cycloaliphatic trivalent organic radical and R is preferably hydrogen or a monovalent organic radical preferably selected from the group consisting of C1 to C6 aliphatic and or cycloaliphatic radicals and C6 to C12 aromatic radicals, e.g. benzyl most preferably hydrogen. The amount of tricarboxylic component to be used in the preparation of the diimide diacids of the present invention is preferably two molar equivalents based on the number of moles of diamines. Obviously, less than two molar equivalents would result in incomplete imidization of the diamine. It is also possible to use more than two molar equivalents to assure optimal imidization. The diimide diacids and diimide diesters of the present invention may be prepared by any of the known methods for the imidization of anhydrides. with diamines. Exemplary of the methods include melt synthesis wherein the anhydride and diamine are heated at between about 100 C. 300 C., preferably from about 1500 2500C., while drawing off water, for several hours to produce the diimide.Alternatively, they may be produced by heating in a solvent including, for example, dimethylformamide, diethylformamide, diethyl acetamide, N methylcaprolactam, or dimethylsulfoxide, among others known to those skilled in the art, or in an azeotropic mixture of said solvent with an additional inert solvent, e.g. xylene, and refluxed at between about 1000 3000C., preferably from about 1500C. 2500C., for several hours to form the diimide. The solvent is subsequently removed by distillation and the residual solvent removed by vacuum drying to leave the diimide diacid as a viscous oily substance. The resultant diimide diacids or diimide diester, as appropriate, is an oily substance, the viscosity of which is dependent in part upon the temperature and the specific diamine used.
