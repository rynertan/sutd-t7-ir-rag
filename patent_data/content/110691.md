# System and method for controlling a multiple access data communications system.

## Abstract
The instant communications system and method for con trolling both digital voice traffic and digital data traffic includes a communication path 10 , a source station 30 11 and a destination station 30 21 . The source and destination sta tions are respectively adapted to be coupled to a source station home network HN 1 and to a destination station home net work HN 2 . The source station is further adapted to transmit a signaling packet on a first transmit control channel. The sig naling packet is for signaling a destination station that the source station has an information packet intended for the desti nation station. The destination station is adapted to detect the signaling packet on a second receive control channel. The sig naling packet includes a field for identifying the source station which has the information packet intended for the destination station. In response to the signaling packet, the destination station is coupled to the source home network. Thereafter, in formation packets may be transmitted from the source station on a third control channel and then be translated to a source station home network channel for transmission to the destina tion station.
