# A PROTECTING DEVICE FOR THE CYLINDER WITH BLADES IN FLESHING MACHINES AND THE LIKE FOR A TANNERY, HAVING A MOVABLE SHIELD SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE OPENING OF THE MACHINE

## Abstract
In hide processing machines provided with cylinders with blades as, for example, fleshing machines, trimming machines, holding machines or the like, which present a wide opening port, a device is provided, which automatically positions the protecting shield 12 for the cylinder with blades 2 at the opening of the opposing roller 3 for the inserting of a hide and which moves the protecting shield 12 away from the cutting area at the closing of the opposing roller 3 itself. The positioning is obtained by mechanical means, at a speed which is synchronized with the approaching or moving away speed of the opposing roller 3 . The purpose is that one to prevent accidental contacts of the hands of the operator with the rotating cylinder with blades 2 .
