## Description
TITLE POLYFLUOROALKYL ESTERS AND THEIR PREPARATION AND USE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to chloromethyl substituted polyfluoroalkyl esters of polybasic acids and their use in treating a variety of substrates, such as textile fabrics and paper, so as to provide the substrate with soil resistance as well as water and oil repellency. It relates further to a process for preparing the compounds of this invention wherein iodinesubstituted polyfluoroalkyl esters are reacted with elemental chlorine in which the iodine substituted esters are in the molten state or dissolved or suspended in an inert liquid.Description of the Prior Art In recent years, polymers and other compounds containing highly fluorinated segments have been used widely for imparting dry soil resistance as well as oil and water repellency to textile substrates. A degree of resistance to dry, traffic caused soiling in carpets prepared from synthetic fibers such as polyesters, polyamides, polyacrylics is said to be provided by fluoro polym,eric coatings, e.g. polymers of perfluoroalkyl acrylates and methacrylates. Because such coated fibers may support the advance of a flamegmore readily than an uncoated fiber, highly fluorinated mono and polycarboxylic acid esters have been used to provide dry soil resistance and resistance to burning, U.S. Patents 3,923,715 and 4,029,585. U.S. Patent 3,716,401 discloses and claims a process for rendering a vinyl surface oil resistant by applying thereto a polymeric composition containing a vinyl polymer dissolved in a volatile solvent and an ester derived from perfluoroethanol and a mono or polycarboxylic acid. U.S. Patent 3,145,222 discloses and claims compounds having the formula Y CnF2n O wherein Y is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine n is 1 20, q is CH2CHIO2CR CH2CHI CH2 mO CH2 2CO2H CH CH CH2 mO CH2 2CO2H CH2CH2 2 2 2 or CH CI CH2 mCO2H R is lower alkyl and m is 0 14.Although the disclosure and claims do not otherwise contemplate such a compound, that patent also discloses the compound, C3F7CH2CHICH2O2CCH3, and indicates it may be hydrolyzed and treated with alkali to give a polyfluoroepoxy polymer intermediate. U.S. Patent 4,034,022 discloses isomers having the formula EMI2.1 wherein CnF 2n l is a perfluorinated aliphatic chain, n is an integer from 2 to 18, x and Y are the same or different and are each a halogen atom, a hydroxyl radical, the group CM in which M is a metallic equivalent or an alkoxy, chloroalkoxy, hydroxypolyalkyleneoxy, aryloxy or NZZ group in which Z and Z are the same or different and are each a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group. It is stated the compounds are liable to find use as emulsifying or foaming agents, particularly when a tensioactive agent resistant to acids and oxidants is needed, as leveling or anti stain agents for polishes or emulsion paints, as corrosion inhibitors, solvent evaporation retarders or as hydrophobic and oleophobic agents. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compounds having the formula EMI3.1 wherein Rf is a fluorinated aliphatic containing at least 3 carbons, R1 is optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, or cycloalkenyl and n is a number from 1 to 4, preferably 2 to 4.It relates also to a method for preparing the compounds of this invention, and to a process of using compounds of this invention to treat textile materials so as to give them dry soil resistance and oil and water repellency. This invention relates still further to a process for the treatment of paper so as to make it repel water and oil. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Rf is a saturated, monovalent, non aromatic, aliphatic radical. The chain may be straight, branched or cyclic, and may be interrupted by divalent oxygen atoms or trivalent nitrogen atoms bonded only to carbon atoms. A fully fluorinated group is preferred, but hydrogen or chlorine atoms may be present as substitutents in the fluorinated aliphatic radical provided that not more than one atom of either is present in the radical for every two carbon atoms, and that the radical must at least contain a terminal perfluoromethyl group. In a preferred embodiment, the fluorinated aliphatic radical contains not more than 20 carbon atoms because such a large radical results in inefficient use of the fluorine content. In a more preferred embodiment, Rf is a perfluoroalkyl containing 3 to 20 carbons. The compounds of this invention can be prepared by the reaction set forth in the following equation EMI4.1 while most of the iodine will be present in the ultimate reaction mixture as ICl, some elemental ioddde will be present. Nbreover some IC may be present. The iodine substituted polyfluoroalkyl ester starting material for the Pasra tion of the compounds of this invention can be prepared by the reaction set forth in the following equation EMI4.2 A wide variety of allyl esters can be used according to this invention. In a preferred embodiment, R1 is alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or cycloalkyl.Thus, for example, R1 can be the residue remaining after esterification of citric, phthalic o, m or p isomer , benzoic, succinic, chlorendic, benzene polycarboxylic acids, such as trimellitic, pyromellitic and the like. The reaction of the iodine substituted polyfluoroalkyl ester with chlorine can be carried out by melting the iodine substituted polyfluoroalkyl ester and contacting the molten ester with chlorine, or the iodinesubstituted polyfluoroalkyl ester can be suspended or dissolved in a suitable liquid and reacted with chlorine. A suitable liquid is inert under the reaction conditions e.g. alcohols or water should be avoided since they would be expected to react. pre ferred liquids include 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoro ethane, 1,1,1,2 tetrachloro 2,2 difluoroethane and tetrachloromethane. It is possible also to use chloroform. All such halocarbons function as solvents for the iodine substituted polyfluoroalkyl ester starting material.Although it is not necessary that the liquid medium be a solvent for that ester, it is preferred that the ester be at least partially soluble in the liquid medium. The reaction of the iodine substituted polyfluoroalkyl ester with chlorine is mildly exothermic, being somewhat more exothermic at the start of the reaction than at a point near its completion. When a solvent is used for the ester starting material, reflux thereof provides effective control of the exotherm. The temperature of the reaction with chlorine is not critical nor is pressure. One can run the reaction at a temperature between 00C and the melting point of the iodine substituted polyfluoroalkyl ester. Usually, the reaction is run at a temperature between about 400 and 550C when a solvent is used, and between about 850 and 900C when the ester starting material is molten during the reaction with chlorine.Although the reaction, whether in solution or in molten form, is usually run at atmospheric pressure, elevated pressures can be used as well. Normally, the reaction is run until essentially all of the covalently bound iodine is displaced from the ester. Normally, a slight excess of chlorine, over that required to satisfy the reaction given above, is used.Introducing chlorine in excess of the amount which is required to displace all iodine in the ester starting material will do no harm, but such an excess does nothing in aid of the reaction either. However, if theRÃ moiety has some tendency to react with chlorine, it may be desirable to avoid a large excess of chlorine.In that way, if the R1 moiety reacts relatively slowly with chlorine, it may be possible to carry the desired displacement of iodine to completion before a significant amount of chlorine reacts with the R1 moiety. After all of the iodine has been displaced from the ester, it is best to convert the iodine chloride s and iodine, if any, to iodide and chloride ions. For example, one can add water and a soluble salt such as sodivul bisulfite for that purpose. The preParation of the iodine substituted polyfluoroalkyl ester is carried out in the presence of a free radical initiator at temperatures in the range between about 500 and 1400C and at pressures between about 1 and 50 atmospheres. If the polyfluoroalkyl iodide or the allyl ester used in the reaction has a boiling point below the desired reaction temperature, a pressure system would be used otherwise, the reaction may be carried out at atmospheric pressure.The free radical initiator may be either an azo compound or a peroxy compound, e.g. a,a azobis isobutyro nitrile 2,2 azobis 2 ,4 dimethylvaleronitrile acetyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide, di t butyl peroxide and the like. The polyfluoroalkyl iodides can be prepared by a variety of reactions. See for example Brace et al.,JACS, 73, 4016 1951 Krespan, J. Org. Chem., 23, 2016 1958 Haszeldine, J. Chem. Soc., 1949, 2856 1952, 4259 1953, 376 Hauptschein et al., JACS, 79, 2549 1957 . The principal use of compounds of this invention involves application of solutions or aqueous dispersions of said compounds to carpets, other woven or non woven textiles, or paper. The desirable characteristics imparted by the application of said compounds include water repellency, oil repellency, and resistance to soiling. The degree to which said desirable characteristics are achieved is evaluated in different ways for the different substrates. For example, in the case of carpets, dry soil resistance provides a measure of the ability of the carpet to retain its new appearance under normal traffic conditions Cn addition, oil and water repellency is required in carpets to provide resistance to staining by spilled liquids, In most of the other end uses, achievement of the desired effects is assayed simply by measuring oil and or water repellency. That may be done by drop tests as reported in Tables 3, 4 and 6 by penetration as reported in Table 5. Application of the novel compounds of this invention from solution or aqueous dispersion to any of the foregoing substrates may be carried out in any known manner so as to deposit on the substrate from about 0.01 to 1.0 of the novel compound, based on the dry weight of the substrate. Preferably, application of the novel compounds of this invention is made from an aqueous dispersion. Subject to the above defined range of quantities of the novel compounds being deposited on the substrate, the aqueous dispersions of compounds of this invention can be blended with an aqueous polymeric suspension. For example, addition of an aqueous suspension of polymethyl methacrylate, makes a composition which can be diluted with water for application to the various substrates contemplated by this invention.The presence of the polymeric suspension, such as an aqueous polymethylmethacrylate, improves dry soil resistance. Such a dispersion, before dilution with water, will normally contain from about 2 to about 20 of fluorinated ester of this invention and between about 2 and about 40 of the polymer, dry basis, provided by the above mentioned suspension. For application to textile substrates, such as carpets, the abovedescribed dispersion is diluted still further with water.Application can be made by any known technique, such as padding, exhaust spraying, and the like. After a compound or compounds of this invention, as a solution or dispersion and optionally containing other components such as, for example, poly methylmeth acrylate , has been applied toXthe desired substrate, it will usually be dried to remove water and 6r solvent. Normally, drying is effected by heating to about 120 170 C, although higher or lower temperatures may be used. In particular, drying at ambient temperature is frequently sufficient, although heating is usually preferred to hasten the drying. Furthermore, repellency effects frequently are improved by heat treatment beyond that required for drying. It appears that such treatment at least partially melts the composition of this invention so that it spreads and more effectively coats the substrate. The oil repellency test used herein is an adapta tion of AATCC Test Method 118 1978. Oil repellency is defined as the ability of a substrate to resist wetting by oily liquids. According to the test method, drops of standard test liquids, consisting of a selected series of hydrocarbons with varying surface tensions, are placed on the substrate and observed for wetting.The oil repellency rating is the highest numbered test liquid which will not wet the surface of the substrate within a period of 30 seconds. Wetting of the surface of the substrate is normally evident by a darkening thereof at the interface. On black or dark surfaces, wetting can be detected by a loss of sparkle within the drop. The standard test liquids are set forth inTable 1. Table 1 Standard Test Liquids Oil Repellency Rating Number Composition 1 Nujol 2 65 35 Nujol n hexa decane by volume at 700F 21 C 3 n hexadecane 4 n tetradecane 5 n dodecane 6 n decane 7 n octane 8 n heptane Nujol is the trademark of Plough, Inc., for a mineral oil having a Saybolt viscosity of 360 390 at 1000F 38 C and a specific gravity of 0.880 0.900 at 600F 15 C . The water repellency test provides an index of aqueous stain resistance in that, generally, the higher the water repellency rating, the better the resistance to staining by water based substances. Like the oil repellency rating, the water repellency rating is the highest numbered test liquid which will not wet the surface of the substrate in a specified amount of time, in this case 10 seconds. The standard test solutions are those of Table 2.

If after 10 seconds two of the three drops are still visible in spherical or hemi spherical form, drops of the next higher numbered test liquid are placed in an adjacent site and observed for 10 seconds.The abovedescribed procedure is continued until at least two or the three drops of the test liquid fail to remain spherical or hemi spherical 10 seconds after application. The following examples are given by way of illustration,not by way of limitation. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight temperatures are expressed in degrees Centigrade and pressures in mm of Hg.

The methyl isobutyl ketone was then distilled out, along with some water, using a partial vacuum and temperatures up to about 550 C. A portion of the finished dispersion was diluted with water and mixed with acetic acid and an aqueous dispersion of polymethylmethacrylate PMMA . The PMMA in the dispersion had an inherent viscosity of about 0.7 0.5 g of PMMA in 100 ml of acetone at 30 C , and was made up of particles having an average size of about 0.06 micron. The mixed dispersion comprising the adduce, acetic acid, PMMA and water was then sprayed onto the face of nylon carpet so that the face fibers of the carpet received 0.055 of fluorine in covalently bound form , 0.186 of polymethylmethacrylate, 0.01 of acetic acid, and about 25 of HzO based on the weight of the fiber.The carpet was dried for 30 minutes in a forced air oven at 270 F. Samples of the carpet were tested for oil and water repellency. Samples thereof were also tested for dry soil resistance by being placed in a heavilytravelled hallway along with untreated samples of the same carpet, being rated for soil resistance in comparison with the untreated carpet. The results of testing of the carpet samples are set, forth in Table 3. Another portion of the finished dispersion was diluted with water and mixed with acetic acid. It was then sprayed onto the face of nylon carpet so that the face fibers thereof received O.055 of fluorine in covalently bound form , 0.01 of acetic acid and about 25 of water. The treated carpet was then dried and tested as described above, giving the data set forth in Table 4.

Separate portions thereof were applied to carpet samples and tested as in Example 1, the results thereof being recited in Tables 3 and 4. ExampLe 3 In a round bottom flask fitted with a reflux con denier maintained at 00C were placed 320 g of the product of Example 1 and 120 ml of 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoroethane. The mixture was stirred at 48 52 C and 36 g of chlorine gas were introduced below the surface of the liquid over a period of 75 minutes. This mixture was left at room temperature overnight. The next morning, the temperature was held in the range of 43 52 while 40 ml of water and then 140 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bisulfite were added. The temperature was raised to 800 to distill out the 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoro ethane. At the same temperature, 100 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone were added, followed by about 147 ml of 20 aqueous sodium hydroxide to bring the pH to 5.4.Then, 120 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone and 60 g of MgSO4 7H2O were added, and after the latter dissolved, the lower aqueous layer was removed in a separatory funnel. To the organic layer was added 200 ml of a hot aqueous solution of MgSO4 7H2O saturated at about 60 C . After mixing well at 80 C, the lower aqueous layer was discarded. The organic layer was washed with 200 ml of water at 80 C, and the product in methyl isobutyl ketone formed the bottom layer. The upper layer was discarded, and after evaporation of part of the methyl isobutyl ketone in the bottom layer, 339 g of residue were obtained. A sample thereof was dried in a vacuum oven and found to be 67.5 non volatile.That corresponds to 229 g of dry product which is 838 of the theoretical yield. The structure of the product is as follows EMI15.1 wherein n is the same as given in the definition ofMPI. The structure of the product was established byNMR spectroscopy and is supported by elemental analysis. The latter gives the following results for n with an average value of 8 Element Calc.

Example 4Chlorination of the Product of Example 2 In a 500 ml round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser maintained at 0 were placed 160 g of the product of Example 2 and 60 ml of 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoroethane. The mixture was stirred at 48 510 and 24 g of chlorine gas were introduced below the surface over a period of about 75 minutes. Then, 20 ml of water was poured down the condenser, followed by 80 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bisulfite added slowly. The reflux condenser was then removed and the flask was heated to 84 85 and held at that temperature for about 15 minutes to distill out the chlorofluorocarbon. Next, was added 90 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone.The aqueous lower layer was removed by means of a separatory funnel. The organic layer was washed with 100 ml of hot, concentrated magnesium sulfate solution. Isopropanol 50 ml was added to facilitate the separation of the aqueous phase. The final wash was 100 ml of water to which 20 ml of isopropanol was added. The resulting solution of the product in methyl isobutyl ketone weighed 237 g and was 56.4 non volatile, corresponding to 134 g of dry product, 97 of the theoretical yield. The structure of the product, established by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, isEMI17.1 The average value of n in the MPI used as starting material is 8, and therefore the average empirical formula is C39H17F5lO7Cl3.

The layers were separated, the the lower layer was washed with three 200 ml portions of water, to the last of which was added 10 ml of isopropanol. The chlorofluorocarbon was then evaporated in a vacuum oven at 90 100 . The product was a clear, amber, viscous liquid and weighed 102 g, representing a 94 yield of EMI21.1 The product crystallized within a day. The structure was established by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy, both proton and Carbon l3.The elemental analysis gave the following results Calc.

The bomb was chilled to about 75 C and evacuated to about 3 mm pressure. Then, the bomb was closed and heated to 1600C for 4 hours.The bomb was then cooled. The contents were a homogeneous dark amber liquid. Of this liquid, 0.4 g was taken and mixed with 100 ml of water to give a rather turbid solution or suspension. The foregoing solution or suspension has a surface tension of 22.4 dynes cm., measured by the ring method using a Du Nouy tensiometer. Example 9 In a round bottom flask equipped with an icewater cooled reflux condenser were placed 74 g of the product of Example 6 and 30 ml of 1,1,2 trichloro I,2,2 trifluoroethane. The mixture was maintained at 51 C while 15 g of chlorine was added below the surface over a period of 53 minutes. Then, 40 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bisulfite were added, dropwise, followed by sufficient 30 aqueous sodium hydroxide to bring the pH to about 6 about 35 ml . The temperature was then raised to 850 to distill out 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2 2 2 trifluoroethane. The result ing mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel and 50 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone were added.After shaking, the lower layer was discarded and 50 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of magnesium sulfate and 20 ml of isopropanol were added and the mixture was shaken again. The lower layer was again discarded and 50 ml of hot water were added. After shaking, the solution of the product lower layer was drawn off. The product solution was evaporated in vacuum removing methyl isobutyl ketone until it weighed 69 grams. Fifty seven grams of the resulting product were mixed with ffarquadff 18 50 3 g Nonionic surfactant 1.5 g 2 Methyl 2,4 pentanediol 0.25 g Water approx. 60 mlThe resulting mixture was well agitated in a blender, then diluted with water and mixed with acetic acid.That mixture was sprayed onto nylon carpet so that the face fibers received 0.055 of fluorine in covalently bound form , 0.01 of acetic acid, and 25 of water based on the weight of the fiber. The carpet was dried and tested as described in Example 1. The test data are set forth in Table 4. Table 3 With PMMA Ex.

That product was then diluted with water to contain 0.035 of fluorine. B. The product of Example 4, treated as described in A to contain 0.035 fluorine. C. The product of Example 9, in the form of a 60t solution in methyl isobutyl ketone, was dispersed in water as described in Example 4. After distillation of the methyl isobutyl ketone, the dispersion was diluted to contain 0.035 fluorine. The non woven fabric was a 608 polyester 408 wood pulp fabric intended for use in operating room garments.The diluted dispersions were padded onto the non woven fabric to obtain a wet pick up of 193 5 . They were then dried by passing twice through a mangle heated to 325 F, the heat being applied once on each side of the fabric, with a contact time in the mangle of 75 seconds. The treated fabrics, as well as an untreated sample, were subjected to the DART 80.9 test, in which a sample of the fabric is cut to the size of the disc of a standard two piece mason jar lid. A one quart mason jar is charged with 600 ml of water containing 0.9 NaCl the disc is clamped to the top of the jar and the jar is inverted. The time for water to penetrate the disc is recorded as set forth in Table 5. Table 5 Dilute Dispersion Used Time for Penetration A 60 min. B 31 min. C 5 min.
