## Description
DESCRIPTION Coupling Structure for Coupling a Servomotor and a Detector FIELD OF THE TECHNICAL ART The present invention relates to a coupling structure for mechanically coupling a servomotor and a detector for detecting the output revolution of the servomotor. More particularly, it relates to a coupling structure which compensates for misalignment between the output shaft of the servomotor and the input shaft of the detector and couples the shafts without play. BACKGROUND OF THE TECHNICAL ART In general, a servomotor is used as a drive so urce for various servo systems in which the output revolution of the servomotor is detected so as to control the speed and the position of an object in the servosystem by controlling the servomotor in response to the detected output revolution of the servomotor. In this case, a detector is connected to an end of the output shaft of the servomotor so as to detect the output revolution of the servomotor. An example of such a detector is an encoder known per se. The input shaft of the encoder is coupled with the output shaft of the servomotor. In this case, it is difficult to completely align the shafts. Therefore, a coupling means which compensates for misalignment is disposed between the shafts.In using such a coupling means, it is required that the shafts be securely coupled without play so that the revolution of the output shaft of the servomotor is reliably transmitted to the input shaft of the detector at the time of starting the revolution or changing the revolutional speed and in order to avoid the creation of a non responsive zone of the detector, in which zone the revolution is not detected even though the servomotor is rotated. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a structure for coupling a servomotor and a detector, the structure compensating for misalignment of the servomotor shaft and the detector shaft and mechanically coupling the shafts without play due to the use of oldham s coupling. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a structure for mechanically coupling a servomotor and a detector for detecting the revolution of an output shaft of the servomotor, characterized in that the structure comprises an oldham s coupling which has projection members extending in crosswise directions and engaging grooves formed at an end of the servomotor output shaft and an end of the detector input shaft, respectively, and in that a slit is formed in each of the projection members of the oldham s coupling so as to form a resilient projection member. The misalignment of the shafts is compensated for due to the crosswise arrangement of the projection members disposed perpendicular to each other. Also, the shafts are coupled without play due to the resiliency of the projection members. The present invention is described in detail hereinafter with reference to the drawings showing an embodiment of the invention BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a diagram showing an arrangement of a coupling portion between a servomotor and a detector. Figure 2 is a partial front view of a coupling structure in accordance with the present invention. Figure 3 is a perspective view of an oldham 5 coupling used in the coupling structure in accordance with the present invention. THE BEST MODE FOR EMBODYING THE INVENTION In Fig. 1, a servomotor 10 has output shafts 12a, 12b. The output shaft 12a is connected to a device not shown to be driven. The output shaft 12b of the servomotor 10 is mechanically coupled to an input shaft 18 of a detector 16 which is, for example, an encoder. Reference numeral 20 designates output signal lines of the detector 16. Features of the present invention reside in a coupling portion 14. In Fig. 2, an oldham s coupling 22 is disposed between the output shaft 12b of the servomotor and the input shaft 18 of the detector. As can be seen fromFig. 3, projection members 24 and 26 are provided on the front surface and the rear surface of the oldham s coupling 22. The projection members 24, 26 extend in crosswise directions, i.e., directions perpendicular to each other. Slits 28, 30 are formed along the center of the projection members 24, 26, respectively, so that the projection members 24, 26 become resilient in the direction along which the slits 28, 30 are opened and closed. The oldham s coupling 22 is disposed between the output shaft 12b and the input shaft 18 in such a manner that the resilient projection members 24, 26 are pushed into corresponding grooves 32, 34, respectively, which are formed on the output shaft 12b and the input shaft 18.By adopting such an arrangement, the servomotor and the detector are coupled without play since a gap is not formed between the projection members and the grooves due to the resiliency of the projection members.Also, the crosswise arrangement of the projection members 24, 26 disposed perpendicular to each other makes it possible to mechanically couple the shaft 12b and the shaft 18, if the output shaft 12b of the servomotor and the input shaft 18 of the detector are misaligned, so that the revolution is smoothly transmitted without generating an excessive load on the shafts, since the oldham s coupling can slide along the grooves of the shafts during the rotation of the servomotor. The oldham s coupling 22 can transmit a large torque since the projection members fit into the grooves without play in the rotational direction. Also, the oldhamts coupling has a simple structure which enables it to be easily manufactured, thereby decreasing the cost thereof in addition to increasing the accuracy and reliability of transmission of the revolution. As is illustrated in Fig. 2, a groove 36 of appropriate depth is formed in each outer surface of the base portion of the resilient projection member 24 so as to adjust the resiliency of the projection member 24. The depth of the slits 28 and 30 is preferably more than the height of the projection members 24 and 26 so as to obtain an optimum resiliency which guarantees smooth movement of the projection members 24 and 26 along the grooves 32 and 34 as well as reliable engagement of the projection members 24 and 26 and the grooves 32 and 34. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The present invention can be applied to various devices which have a mechanism for transmitting the revolution of a motor.
