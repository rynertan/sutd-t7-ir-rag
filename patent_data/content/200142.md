## Description
This invention relates to an improvement of a dry type integral multilayer analytical element for analysis of a particular component in a liquid sample. More particularly, this invention relates to an integral multilayer analytical element useful for analysis of an aqueous liquid sample such as for a clinical test where a body fluid is employed as a sample. Recently, as a dry type analytical element, many integral multilayer analytical elements wherein a water absorptive reagent layer and a porous spreading layer are provided on a light transmissive support have been proposed. The reagent layer contains reagents for color forming reaction and a hydrophilic polymer binder, and the porous spreading layer is located at the topmost layer. In such multilayer analytical elements, an aqueous liquid sample spotted on the spreading layer spreads in this layer, and it reaches the reagent layer. Then, it reacts with the reagents to produce a detectable species such as a colored substance. The object substance such as a particular component of a body fluid can be determined by measuring this detectable species. As the means to measure the detectable species it is known that a porous light reflecting layer is provided above the reagent layer US A 3,992,158 . In the case of this analytical element, light is irradiated from under the support, and the reflected light is measured. Precision of this method is raised because influence of the suspensoids such as blood cells which inhibit the measurement can be removed. As the light reflecting layer, various blushed polymer layers are disclosed in the specification of the above patent. They include a microporous blushed polymer layer formed by the deposition of polycarbonate particulates, polyamide particulates, and cellulose ester particulates, such as microporous filter membrane Millipore or Metricell formed by blushed polymer of cellulose ester, and a microporous layers where particulates of e.g. titanium dioxide or barium sulfate, are dispersed in a binder such as cellulose acetate, polyvinyl alcohol or gelatin. On the other hand, it is also known that a radiation blocking layer is provided under the reagent layer US A 4,042,335 . In the case of this analytical element, the detectable species produced in the reagent layer passes through this radiation blocking layer, and accumulated in the detection layer located thereunder. Light irradiaded from under the support is blocked by the radiation blocking layer. That is, it is intended that the transmittance at the wave langth to be measured is made less than about 1.0 optical density is larger than about 2.0. , and influence of the reagent layer on the measurement of the detectable species can be removed. As the material of the radiation blocking layer, it is written in the specification that the gelation in which particulates of an inorganic pigment such as carbon black, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide or barium sulfate are dispersed and the blushed polymer layer in which the above inorganic pigment is added, can be utilized. However, in the case that the light reflecting layer is provided above the reagent layer, influence of the reagent layer largely appears. On the other hand, in the case that the radiation blocking layer is introduced, sensitivity of the measurement is lowered because the amount of the detectable species passing through this layer remarkably decreases. Particularly, when a light reflecting pigment such as titanium dioxide particulates is employed for the light reflecting layer or the rediation blocking layer, it is necessary to increase its content in order to secure the light reflectance or the radiation blocking. As a result, it becomes difficult to form the above layers uniformly, and physical strength of the layers becomes weak because the content of the polymer binder in the layers lowers. An object of the present invention is to provide an integral multilayer analytical element capable of removing the influence of a reagent layer without lowering the sensitivity. Another object of the present invention is to provide an integral multilayer analytical element in which a layer containing particulates of a light reflecting pigment in a high concentration is eliminated, and thereby its manufacture is made easy and its physical strength is raised. A still another object of the present invention is to provide an integral multilayer analytical element of which the number of layers is decreased and thereby its maunfacture is made easy. A further object of the present invention is to provide an integral multilayer analytical element of which precision of the measurement at a low concentration range is raised by lowing its blank value. A still further object of the present invention is to provide an integral multilayer analytical element capable of measuring in a well precision in a wide concentration range by lowering the blank value. The present invention provides an integral multilayer analytical element which has achieved these objects, and based upon the knowleage that, when a small amount of light scattering particulates such as titanium dioxide is added to the layer where a detectable species is accumulated or a layer located on the side of the support therefrom, the detectable species can be determined in a high sensitivity and a high precision. Thus, the integral multilayer analytical element of the present invention comprises a water impermeable light transmissive support, a hydrophilic layer containing a water absorptive hydrophilic polymer binder and a spreading layer superposed in this order, and contains at least one reagent capable of reacting with a component of a sample to produce a defectable species capable of detecting by light, which is characterized in that light scattering particulates in an amount which makes light transmittance to 10 2.5 are added to the hydrophilic layer and or a layer located on the side of the support therefrom. The subject to be measured includes various body fluid components such as cholesterol, uric acid, creatinine and enzymes, ammonia, saccharides such as glucose, and proteins. The sample containing such a subject is an aqueous liquid, and includes various body fluids, such as a blood sample including whole blood, blood plasma and blood serum, lymph, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, vaginal fluid and urine, water to drink, river water, factory waste water, and alcoholic liquors. As the water impermeable light transmissive support, a known support employed in an usual multlayer analytical element may be employed. Such a support is a sheet or a laminate having a thickness in the range from 50 µm to 1 mm, preferably from 80 µm to 0.3 mm and being clear in the range from near ultraviolet to near infrared regions. Such a sheet or a laminate may be made from a polyester for example, polyethylene terephthalate or polycarbonate of bisphenol A , a cellulose ester for example, cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate or cellulose acetate propionate , or polystyrene. A known undercoating layer or a known adhesive layer such as disclosed in the foregoing patent specifications may be provided on the surface of the support in order to secure the adhesion of the support to the hydrophilic layer. The hydrophilic layer is the layer to accumulate the detectable species produced by the reaction with a reagent, and consists of a hydrophilic polymer binder alone or together with other components such as reagents and additives. The hydrophilic layer may also function as a water absorption layer which absorbs water to swell and which receives and accumulates the detectable species, and as a registration layer which contains a mordant having negative charge or positive charge capable of immobilizing the detectable species and which absorbs water to swell. Examples of the hydrophilic polymer binder usable for the hydrophilic layer are gelatin including acid treated gelatin and deionized gelatin, gelatin delivatives such as phthalated gelatin and hydroxyalkyl acrylate grafted gelatin, agarose, pulluran, pullulan derivatives, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. They are disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI No. 59 171864 and EP A 0,142,849. Thickness of the hydrophilic layer in dry state is usually 2 µm to 100 µm, preferably 3 µm to 50 µm, particularly preferable 5 µm to 30 µm. It is preferable that the hydrophilic layer is substantially transparent. This hydrophilic layer may contain the light scattering particulates described later, and in addition, a part of or whole reagents, a pH buffer composition, a macromolecular pH buffer, a base polymer, an acid polymer or a macromolecular mordant, to be known may also be contained in this layer. A reagent layer may be provided independently.

The reagent layer may contain a pH buffer composition, a macromolecular pH buffer, a base polymer, an acid polymer or a macromolecular mordant. The spreading layer spreads a liquid sample.

Various layers disclosed in the specifications of the foregoing patents may be introduced into the multilayer element of the invention. Such layers include a filter layer, a semipermeable membrane layer, a barrier layer, a diffusion hindering layer migration inhibiting layer and a layer having two or more of the functions mentioned above. The hydrophilic layer and the substantially nonporous reagent layer may be provided on the foregoing water impermeable light transmissive support by a known application method. The microporous reagent layer may be provided according to the method disclosed in the specifications of EP A 0,114,403 and EP A 0,115,873. The reagent layer should be located higher than the hydrophilic layer. The reagent s reacts with a component of a sample to produce a detectable species capable of detecting by light. The light may be visible light, ultraviolet light or infrared light. The detectable species includes a colored substance, a fluorescent material, an ultraviolet absorbing material, an infrared absorbing material, suspended matter, emulsified matter and a material to vary or decrease one or more of these materials. Examples of the reagent include various reagent compositions containing enzyme disclosed in the foregoing patent specifications and other known analytical reagents and clinical reagents for diagnosis. The reagent may be contained in the spreading layer, the hydrophilic layer and or an optional, separate reagent layer. When the reagent is unstable and it is denatured by contact with air, this reagent is preferably added to an inner layer such as the hydrophilic layer or the reagent layer. When two or more reagents are employed, all reagents may be added to one layer or two or more layers. In the case that the reagent is contained in the spreading layer, it is preferable that the spreading layer is first laminated on the hydrophilic layer, and then the reagent solution is applied thereon as described in the specifications of Japanese Patent KOKAI No. 59 171864, EP A 0,162,301 and EP A 0,162,302. The integral multilayer analytical element of the invention is characterized in that a particular amount of the light scattering particulates is dispersed into the hydrophilic layer where the detectable species is accumulated and or a layer located on the side of the support therefrom. Suitable mean particle size of the light scattering particulates is in the range of 0.1 µm to 2 µm, preferably 0.2 µm to 1 µm. Examples of the light scattering particulates are titanium dioxide particulates such as rutile, anatase and brookite microcrystalline particulates having a particle size of 0.1 µm to 1.2 µm, barium sulfate particulates and aluminum particulates and microflakes. Among them, titanium dioxide particulates and barium sulfate particulates are preferable. The medium where the light scattering particulates are dispersed should be light transmissive. For example, the hydrophilic polymer binder mentioned previously and other weakly hydrophilic materials such as regenerated cellulose and cellulose acetate may be employed. Among these, gelatin, its derivative and polyacrylamide are preferable. A known hardening agent cross linking agent may be added to gelatin or its derivative. A hydrophobic medium such as diacetyl cellulose may also be employed. The light scattering particulates may be dispersed in the support. The layer containing the light scattering particulates may be located on the reverse side of the support. The amount of the light scattering particulates is to make the transmittance at the wave length used for measuring detetable species to 10 to 2.5 , preferably 8 to 3 , more preferably 6 to 3 . The light scattering particulates may be added to two or more layers, and in this case, the above amount is the total amount contained in the layers. Thickness of the layer containing the light scattering particulates is in the range of 2 µm to 100 µm, usually 3 µm to 50 µm, preferably 5 µm to 30 µm, in dry state. When the light scattering particulates are added to two or more layers, the above thickness is the total thickness summed up the layers containing the light scattering particulates. The layer containing the light scattering particulates is translucent. When white particulates such as titanium dioxide and barium sulfate are employed, appearance of the layer containing such light scattering particulates is milk white and translucent. The integral multilayer analytical element of the invention is preferably cut into square or circular pieces having a side or diameter of 15 mm to 30 mm, and put in a silde frame as disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI No. 57 63452, US A 4,169,751, US A 4,387,990 and PCT application WO 83 00391. The measurement is carried out, for example, according to the manner disclosed in the specifications of the foregoing patents. 5 µl to 30 µl, preferably 8 µl to 15 µl of an aqueous sample is spotted on the spreading layer, and incubated at a definite temperature in the range of 20 C to 45 C for a prescribed time, if necessary. Thereafter, detectable variation such as color change or coloring in the multilayer analytical element is measured from the side of the support through reflection photometry, and the subject component in the sample is determined by the principle of colorimetry. In the multilayer analytical element of the present invention, the influence of a conventional reagent layer decreases up to the extent being negligible without lowering the sensitivity. The blank value of this element is low, and precision of the measurement at a low concentration range is also high. As a result of these, the effect comparative to the introduction of a registration layer is obtained with respect to the influence of contaminates. In the multilayer analytical element of the invention, a reflecting layer and a light shielding layer are not necessary, and accordingly, at least one layer can be eliminated. Uniform application of the layer containing the light scattering particulates is made easy because of its low concentration. As a result of these, manufacture of the element of the invention is easy. In the measurement using the multilayer analytical element of the invention, base line is stable, and reproducibility is high. The following examples are given to illustrate the present invention in more detail.

Light transmittance at the wave length of 500 nm and its vicinity of the dry hydrophilic layer was 3.3 . 4 g of deionized gelatin and 0.2 g of polyoxyethylene nonyl phenyl ether hydroxyethylene units 10 average were dissolved in 100 ml of water to produce an adhesive layer solution. This solution was applied on the hydrophilic layer to form an adhesive layer having a dry thickness of 4 µm. The adhesive layer was dampened with water. A cotton broad cloth made of No.100 count cotton yarn, about 200 µm in thickness was pressed to laminate thereon as the spreading layer, and dried to prepare an integral multilayer analytical element for the determination of glucose. This element was cut into square pieces, and each piece was placed in the plastic mount to form a chemical analytical slide for glucose determination according to the same manner as Example 1. As a comparison, another chemical analytical slide for glucose determination was prepared in the same manner as above except that titanium dioxide particulates were not added to the hydrophilic layer. Measurements of glucose content were carried out as follows. Human blood was drawn with heparin, and centrifuged to obtain human blood plasma containing 98 mg dl of glucose as a sample solution. Each 10 µl of the sample solution was spotted on the spreading layer of each slide, and incubated at 37 C for 6 minutes. Reflection optical density was measured by using a light having a central wave length of 500 nm from the PET film side, and glucose content was determined by reference to a calibration curve prepared previously. The same measurements were repeated 20 times in order to examine reproducibility. The results are shown in Table 4. The above results indicate that in the case of the element of the invention, dispersion of the measured values was small and the reproducibility was good. Human blood was drawn with sodium fluoride, and centrifuged to obtain human blood plasmas. Four hemolyzed plasma samples Nos. 1 4 were selected, and influence of homoglobin content upon the measurement of glucose concentration was examined by using the slide of Example 4 and its comparative slide. Glucose concentrations of the four samples were determined by hexokinase method besides the above slides, and their hemoglobin contents were determined by cyanomethemoglobin method. The results are shown in Table 5. The above results indicate that positive error caused by hemoglobin is depressed in a wide range of hemoglobin content in the element of the invention.

This suspension was applied on the above reagent layer so that its dry thickness became 10 µm, and dried to form a light shielding layer. Light transmittance at the wave length of 500 nm and its vicinity of the light shielding layer was 1.7 . On the light shielding layer, the same adhesive layer and spreading layer as Example 4 were provided in the same manner as Example 4. The comparative element thus obtained was cut into square pieces, and each piece was placed in the plastic mount to form a chemical analytical slide for glucose determination in the same manner as Example 4. Human blood was drawn with heparin, and centrifuged to obtain three human plasma samples containing each 98 mg dl, 326 mg dl and 565 mg dl of glucose. Using these samples and the slides prepared in Example 4 and the above comparative slides containing a light shielding layer, 20 times determinations of glucose concentration per each sample were repeated.
