## Description
FERRULE, COUPLING AND COUPLING PROCESS The invention relates to attachable couplings or hose, but more particularly, the invention relates to a deformable ferrule for use in coupling hose. Couplings that are post assembled to flexible hose typically have a male stem portion that is insertable into a hose end and a ferrule that is concentric with the male stem. The ferrule may be pre attached to the male stem or post attached to the male stem during a coupling process requiring deformation of the ferrule.Together, the male stem and ferrule define an annular cavity for receiving a hose end. The coupling is retained to the hose end by pinching or compressing it between the ferrule and stem. The ferrule may be pre attached to the stem such as by crimping an end portion of the ferrule to a stem collar so that the annular hose receiving cavity is formed. A ferrule as a separate part, may be attached to a collar of the stem when the ferrule is deformed such as by crimping or swaging. Some ferrules have a smooth bore and are deformed during crimping to provide what is known as a ripple crimp where a plurality of annular ridges and grooves are formed in the ferrule sidewall. The male stem may have a plurality of annular serrations or grooves to aid in gripping a hose end when a ferrule is deformed during the coupling process. In some applications, circumferential, helical, or longitudinal ribs are provided on the inside of the ferrule to aid in gripping a hose end. Such ribs may contact an embedded reinforcement of the hose for greater coupling retention. The ferrules may be deformed to a generally cylindrical exterior shape such as by crimping or swaging. A pre attached ferrule having a constant wall thickness and a frusto conical shape to aid in inserting a hose end prior to deformation is shown in U.S.PatentNo.3530900. During the coupling process, the frusto conical shaped ferrule is crimped to have a generally cylindrical shape with a plurality of circumferential ribs and grooves that co operate to pinch the hose end. A post attached ferrule is exemplified by U.S.Patent No.4305608. The ferrule has a plurality of longitudinally oriented ribs that are capable of penetrating a hose cover to embed with a hose reinforcement when the ferrule is deformed to have a generally cylindrical exterior shape. During crimping, portions of the ribs are deformed against a stem collar to define a means for attaching the ferrule to the male stem. Another example of a pre attached ferrule is shown in U.S. Patent No.4226446. A serrated stem and ferrule with a ripple crimp is used to pinch a hose end and retain a coupling. A difference in the pitch spacing between a ripple crimp and serrations on a male stem causes the hose to be pinched in progressively reduced amounts of compression even though the ferrule and stem define a generally annular cavity for receiving the hose end. While reduced pressure zones are recognised as being beneficial to minimise local stresses in a coupled hose end for improving coupling retention, special care must be taken to ensure that the pitch spacing of the ripple crimp is properly located with respect to the pitch spacing of the male stem so that reduced pressure zones are achieved. Although U.S. Patent No.3530900 shows generally a pre crimped frusto conical cavity for receiving a hose end, it and U.S. Patent Nos.4226446 and 4305608 show post crimped annular cavities for pinching or compressing a hose end. Of these, only U.S. PatentNo.4305608 appears suitable for high pressure hose applications as indicated by ferrule ribs directly contacting a hose reinforcement. Also, U.S. Patent No.2028316 shows a ferrule with circumferential ribs and a tapered outside diameter, in which the ribs are forced inwards when the ferrule is deformed. In accordance with the invention, a deformable ferrule for use with a male stem in coupling hose is provided as a sleeve having a fitting end, hose end, and a sidewall portion that decreases in thickness going longitudinally of the sleeve toward the hose end. Ribs are provided and project from an inside surface of the sleeve to aid in gripping a hose end.A deformed ferrule e.g. as by crimping or swaging defines a frusto conical surface for gripping a hose end. The frusto conical surface progressively reduces localised gripping stresses in the hose end. The frusto conical inside surface is formed during the deformation process when a ferrule which may initially have a frusto conical exterior surface is deformed to a generally cylindrical shape e.g. such as by crimping or swaging . An object of the invention is to provide a hose ferrule that controls decreasing pinching or compressing of a hose end during crimping in a direction from a fitting end of the ferrule toward the hose end of the ferrule. Several embodiments of the invention are now described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein FIGURE 1 is an isometric view of a preferred embodiment of the ferrule partially cut away to expose inner surface portions of the ferrule FIGURE 2 is a full sectional view taken along the line 2 2 of Figure 1 FIGURE 3 is a sectional view taken along the line 3 3 of Figure 2 FIGURE 4 is a partially cut away sectional side view of a coupled hose assembly showing the ferrule of Figure 3 prior to deformation FIGURE 5 is a view similar to that of Figure 4 showing the ferrule deformed on a coupled hose FIGURE 6 is a view similar to Figure 3 but showing the deformed ferrule of Figure 5, and FIGURES 7 and 8 are sectional views like Figure 3 with each showing a further embodiment of the invention. Referring to Figures 1 to 6, the ferrule 10 of the invention includes a sleeve type body 12 having a fitting end 14, a hose end 16, a substantially cylindrical inner surface 18, and an exterior surface having a frusto conical surface portion 20 and, optionally, a cylindrical surface portion 22. The inner surface 18 and outer surface portion 20 outline a sidewall portion 24 that decreases in thickness going longitudinally of the body 12 toward the hose end 16. A plurality of circumferentially spaced ribs 26 are oriented longitudinally of the body and project from the inner surface. The ribs may extend a major length of the body and ends of the ribs may be tapered 28. In service, the ferrule is used with a male stem 30 having some type of fitting 31 at one end and optionally a serrated stem 32 at the other end. The ferrule is slipped over an end portion of a hose 34 constructed with a tube 36, reinforcement 38, and cover 40 as exemplified by Figure 4. The stem may also include a locking collar 42 for securing the ferrule to the stem in a manner as described in U.S. Patent No.4305608. The male stem is inserted in the hose bore and the ferrule is deformed by reducing it in diameter, such as by crimping or swaging, as illustrated by Figures 5 and 6. During deformation, the outer surface is changed to a generally cylindrical shape 44 and the inner surface is changed to a generally frusto conical shape 46. The ribs change from being what may be described as longitudinal elements of a cylinder Figure 3 to frusto conical elements of a cone Figure 6 . Grooves 48 are formed in the ribs by the collar 42 and the hose reinforcement 38 is partially embedded 50 into portions of the ribs upon ferrule deformation.The ribs grip the reinforcement and the inner surface grips the hose end in a constantly decreasing manner progressively to reduce the amount of hose compression or pinching and thereby eliminate localised high stress points in the coupled hose at the hose end of the ferrule.The amount of reduction in wall thickness to effect a usable coupling will, of course, vary for different hoses and different applications. It has been determined that a satisfactory coupling is achieved when the outer frusto conical surface portion has a half conical angleA up to about 40. The cylindrical surface portion acts as an aid to reduce coupling skewing during crimping by being the first surface contacted and held by radially moving cylindrical elements of a crimping machine of the type well known in the art. Additional examples of ferrules of the invention are illustrated in Figures 7 and 8. Both of the ferrules exhibit a sidewall portion 24 that decreases in thickness going longitudinally of the ferrule toward the hose end 16. Both of the ferrules exhibit on deformation, an outer surface that is generally cylindrically shaped and an inner surface portion that is generally frustoconically shaped. More specifically, Figure 7 illustrates a ferrule 52 having a frusto conical outer surface 54 at a half angle B and a frusto conical inner surface 56 at a conical half angle C. The angles B, C need not be equal. Longitudinally oriented ribs 58 extend from the interior surface as elements of the frustoconical surface 56. In use, the outer surface 54 is deformed to a generally cylindrical section in a manner described in reference to Figures 5 and 6. Such deformation increases angle C. Figure 8 illustrates a ferrule 60 having a generally cylindrical outer surface 62 and a frusto conical inner surface 64 having a conical half angle D. During deformation the ferrule is reduced to a smaller diameter with the outer surface remaining substantially cylindrical and the inner surface remaining frusto conical so that the hose end receives progressively reduced amounts of pinching or compression. Longitudinally oriented ribs 66 extend along the inner surface as elements of the frusto conical surface 64. If desired, a collar not shown may extend from the body at the fitting end 14.
