# Programmable sequence controller.

## Abstract
There is provided a programmable sequence controller which need not be equipped with a tape reader for reading a paper tape bearing a punched program or the like. A prepared sequence program or the like is punched in a paper tape in ac cordance with the standards of a paper tape reader 101a which is provided in a numerical control device 1, and then is trans ferred from the numerical control device 1 to a random access memory 201c in the programmable sequence controller 2. The sequence program is read from the random access memory 201c to permit the execution of sequential operations by pro cessing the program.
