# Wire end processing apparatus.

## Abstract
A wire end processing apparatus comprises a first moving means operable to first move a first wire clamp means away from a cutter means along the path of travel of an insulated wire and then to move the first wire clamp means toward the cutter means obliquely relative to the path of travel of the wire to thereby bring the leading end of the insulated wire into a first terminal fastening means a second moving means operable to first move a second wire clamp means away from the cutter means and then to move the second clamp means toward the cutter means obliquely relative to the path of travel of the wire to thereby bring the trailing end of the wire length into a second terminal fastening means.
