# Compositions suitable for use in preparing dialysis solutions, and processes for producing such compositions.

## Abstract
A dry composition suitable for use in preparing a dialysis solution comprises sodium chloride, a physiologically acceptable alkalizing agent, a physiologically acceptable salt of magnesium and a physiologically acceptable salt of cal cium. When the alkalizing agent is sodium acetate the com position is in the form of chemically homogeneous granules when the alkalizing agent is sodium bicarbonate the composi tion may be a mixture of granular or particulate sodium bicar bonate with chemically homogeneous granules of the other components, or it may be a particulate admixture of the com ponents. The dry compositions present a readily water solu ble form with constant proportions of components and are particularly suited to easy dissolution in water to produce dialysis solutions. The homogeneity is reached by rapidly vaporising the water of the former solution of the ingredients, optionally after crushing.
