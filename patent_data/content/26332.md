# Non adhesive gel composition for stabilizing dentures.

## Abstract
A substantially non adhesive gel composition for use in improving the fit and adaptation of dentures to the oral cavity of the user, which comprises about 1 to 10 by weight of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer or alginate, about 5 to about 40 by weight of a demulcent, preferably glycerine, and about 50 to about 95 water. The composition reduces denture movement and prevents buildup of undesirable deposit such as plaque or the like.
