# Ion shower apparatus.

## Abstract
An ion shower apparatus comprising a plasma forma tion chamber 1, 21 in which plasma is produced so as to produce ions, a single ion extraction grid 7, 41, 50 disposed in one portion of the plasma formation chamber 1, 21 and for extracting the ions from the plasma formation chamber 1, 21 so as to form an ion beam 11 in the form of shower, a specimen chamber 2, 22 in which the surface of a specimen 9 subjected to etching or deposition or a target 18 subjected to sputtering is irradiated with the ion beam 11 in the form of shower, and a shield grid 16, 40 disposed in the vicinity of the ion extraction grid 7, 41, 50 in the plasma formation chamber 1, 21 and spaced apart from the thickness of the plasma sheath 14 produced over the ion extraction grid 7, 41, 50 , in a manner that the shield grid 16, 40 permits the passage of the plasma therethrough and prevents the electric field produced by the ion extraction grid 7, 41, 50 substantially from extending to the remaining region of the plasma formation chamber 1, 21 . The ion extraction grid 7, 41, 50 is not damaged. An ion beam 11 with a high current is obtained stably.
