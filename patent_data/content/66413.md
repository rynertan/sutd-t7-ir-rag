# Nitrile barrier resins compositions and process for production thereof.

## Abstract
A nitrile barrier resin composition which comprises a blend of 1 a copolymer produced by the polymerization of a major proportion of a mono unsaturated nitrile and a minor proportion of another monovinyl monomer component polymerizable therewith optionally in the presence of a preformed diene rubber 2 a carboxylic acid and 3 an alkaline filler containing a polyvalent cation. The physical properties of a nitrile barrier resin, particu larly the tensile modulus, heat distortion temperature and processability, are improved by including therein the car boxylic acid processing aid and the alkaline filler material.
