# Somatostatin analogs and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
Bicyclic somatostatin analogs and pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acid addition salts thereof are prepared by the solid phase method. These analogs have the property of inhibiting the release of insulin, glucagon and growth hormone in humans and animals. The compounds are particularly useful in the treatment of diabetes. Due to the bicyclic structure, these analogs are resistant to enzymatic metabolism and have a longer duration of activity.
