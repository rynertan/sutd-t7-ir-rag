## Description
INJECTION MOLDING PROCESS AND APPARATUS THEREFORE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an improved process and apparatus for the injection molding of liquid crystalline polymer. The process produces molded articles having enhanced mechanical properties. The injection molding of molten thermotropic polymer is well known in the art. The conventional method of injection molding is to first inject the polymer melt into the closed mold and, subsequently, to pack additional melt into the cavity to compensate for the densification of the melt during the cooling stage. Conventionally molded articles of liquid crystalline polymer, or other thermoplastics whose mechanical properties are a direct function of their molecular orientation in the molten phase, suffer from low tensile strength in the far or wdead end zone of the mold cavity where the melt layers begin to pack. It is in the dead end zone of the mold cavity where the laminar flow of the polymer in the mold cavity strikes the wall of the cavity and reverses its flow direction upon packing.This substantial interruption with laminar flow results in rebound wave patterns on a molecular scale in the melt with concomitant points of structural weakness. In contrast, the molded articles produced by the apparatus and process of the present invention exhibit enhanced mechanical properties due to the laminar flow orientation of the polymer molecules substantially throughout the molded article. According to the process of the present invention, articles having improved properties due to the minimization of rebound molecular wave motion i.e. patterns within the mold cavity can be formed by allowing the laminar flow of molten polymer to exit through the heretofore dead end of the injection mold. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for injection molding thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer to form molded articles with enhanced mechanical properties. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for injection molding thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer to form molded articles having their constituent polymer molecules oriented in laminar fashion substantially throughout the article. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for the injection molding of thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer to form molded articles with enhanced mechanical properties. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for the injection molding of thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer to form molded articles having their constituent polymer molecules substantially oriented in laminar fashion throughout the article. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an improved article molded from thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer with enhanced mechanical properties. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an article molded from thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer wherein the constituent polymer molecules are oriented in laminar fashion substantially throughout the article. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an improved process for molding thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer and the apparatus for such process. The process comprises the steps of providing a molten stream of the polymer to be molded injecting said molten stream into the cavity of the mold allowing a portion of the melt to flow out of the cavity so as to substantially preserve the laminar flow pattern of the melt in the cavity by minimizing rebound molecular wave motion within the cavity and solidifying the molten polymer into a molded article.

Examples of such polymers include those consisting essentially of p oxbenzoyl units, pdioxyphenyl units, dioxycarbonyl units, and terephthoyl units. A thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer commonly is selected for use in the formation of the molded article of the present invention which possesses a melting temperature within the range that is amenable to injection molding while employing commercially available equipment. For instance, thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers commonly are selected which exhibit a melting temperature somewhere within the range of approximately 2000C. to 4000C. The thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer selected preferably also exhibits an inherent viscosity I.V. of at least 2.0 dl. g. when dissolved in a concentration of 0.1 percent by weight in pentafluorophenol at 600C. e.g., an inherent viscosity of approximately 2.0 to 15.0 dl. g. . The particularly preferred wholly aromatic polyester for use in the present invention is that disclosed in UnitedStates Patent No. 4,161,470 which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase at a temperature below approximately 350 C. This polyester consists essentially of the recurring moieties I and II wherein EMI7.1 The polyester comprises approximately 10 to 90 mole percent of moiety I, and approximately 10 to 90 mole percent of moiety II.In one embodiment, moiety II is present in a concentration of approximately 65 to 85 mole percent, and preferably in a concentration of approximately 70 to 80 mole percent, e.g., approximately 73 mole percent.

In addition, at least some of the hydrogen atoms present upon the rings optionally may be replaced by substitution selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen, phenyl, substituted phenyl, and mixtures thereof. Such polymer preferably has an inherent viscosity of approximately 3.5 to 7.5 dl. g. when dissolved in a concentration of 0.1 percent by weight in pentafluorophenol at 600C. The particularly preferred wholly aromatic poly esteramide or aromatic aliphatic poly ester amide for use in the present invention is disclosed in commonly assigned United StatesPatent No. 4,330,457, which is capable of forminq anisotropic melt phase at a temperature below approximately 4000C. The poly ester amide there disclosed consists essentially of recurring moieties I, II, III and optionally, IV wherein EMI8.1 EMI8.2 where A is a divalent radical comprising at least one aromatic ring or a divalent trans 1,4 cyclohexylene radical III is Y Ar Z , where Ar is a divalent radical comprising at least one aromatic ring, Y is 0, NH or NR, and Z is NH, where R is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an aryl group and IV is 0 Ar 0 , where Ar is a divalent radical comprising at least one aromatic ring wherein at least some of the hydrogen atoms present upon the rings optionally may be replaced by substitution selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen, phenyl, substituted phenyl, and mixtures thereof, and wherein said poly ester amide comprises approximately 10 to 90 mole percent of moiety I, approximately 5 to 45 mole percent of moiety II, approximately 5 to 45 mole percent of moiety III, and approximately 0 to 40 mole percent of moiety IV.The preferred dicarboxyl aryl moiety II is EMI9.1 the preferred moiety III is EMI9.2 and the preferred dioxy aryl moiety IV is EMI9.3 When forming the molded article of the present invention, conventional injection apparatus can be used in conjunction with the molding apparatus of the present invention. Suitable injection apparatus include the Stubbe automatic injection molding machine model SKM 50 45. The temperature and pressure conditions selected for molding the molten thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer will be influenced by the melting temperature of the polymer and its viscosity as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Typically, injection molding temperatures approximately 50C. 5O0C. above the polymer melting temperature and pressures of approximately 2000 to 20,000 psi 13788 to 137,880 kPa are selected. In the conventional molding of liquid crystalline polymer, melt flows into the cavity in laminar fashion, with each strata in the melt flowing at a uniform rate without substantial inter strata mixing. When this flow strikes the downstream dead end of the cavity and rebounds therefrom, laminar flow at this end ceases due to interference from the rebound molecular wave patterns. Since the mechanical properties of molded liquid crystalline polymer are directly related to the degree of ordered arrangement of molecules in each strata, this reverse flow causes points of structural weakness in the molded article, detracting from its mechanical properties. With the present invention, an outlet placed at the downstream end of the cavity allows molten material to flow out of the cavity, thus preventing undesired rebound molecular wave motion i.e., patterns within the cavity. In a preferred embodiment, a passage communicates with the downstream outlet so as to receive the molten material. The present invention also contemplates having the molten material flow into the mold cavity through upstream inlets placed at both ends of the mold with the downstream outlet placed between said inlets. Also, it is within the ambit of the present invention to have the molten material flow into the mold cavity through an upstream inlet located between two downstream outlets. It is further within the ambit of the present invention to provide at least one additional outlet downstream of said inlet e.g., between said outlet at the downstream end and said upstream inlet to further modify the flow characteristics of the molten material if desired. It is also possible to provide a plurality of inlets in one end of the mold. Once the molded article is removed from the mold, the stub of material that solidifies in the passage may be shorn from the article. Articles molded in accordance with the present invention exhibit mechanical properties superior to those of articles molded conventionally. The mechanical properties of molded articles produced in accordance with the process of the present invention can be improved still further by subjecting the articles to heat treatment following injection molding. The articles may be thermally treated in an inert atmosphere e.g., nitrogen, argon, helium or alternatively a flowing oxygen containing atmosphere e.g., air . For instance, the article may be brought to a temperature approximately 50C. to 306C, below the melting temperature of the liquid crystalline polymer, at which temperature the article remains a solid object.The heat treatment times commonly range from a few minutes to a number of days, e.g., from 0.5 to 200 hours, or more.Preferably the heat treatment is conducted for a time of 1 to 48 hours e.g., approximately 24 to 30 hours . The heat treatment improves the properties of the article by increasing the molecular weight of the liquid crystalline polymer and increasing the degree of crystallinity. The following Examples are given as specific illustrations of the invention. It should be understood,however, that the invention is not limited to the specific details set forth in the Examples.Example 1 Standard ASTM 8.5 21.6 cm tensile bars were molded from the particularly preferred thermotropic liquid crystalline wholly aromatic polyester disclosed in UnitedStates Patent No 4,161,470.

The polymer was molded utilising a conventional injection apparatus with a mold apparatus as illustrated inFigure 3. The molten polymer was injected into valve 1, and flowed in a substantially laminar fashion into runner 2, through upstream inlet 3 and into the mold cavity 4.
