# Industrial scale process for the production of polyols by fermentation of sugars.

## Abstract
An industrial process for producing polyols comprises aerobically fermenting a sugar using Moniliella tomentosa var. pollinis. The total amount of the sugar added to the fermentation medium is in the range of from 40 to 80 weight volume of the medium and the amount of sugar added at the start of the fermentation is from 20 to 35 weight volume of the medium and sugar is progressively added to the medium so that, at the end of the fermentation, the total amount of sugar which has been added is at least 40 weight volume. The process is especiaily useful for the production of erythritol and or ribitol. The process enables a high final product concentration to be achieved and, at the same time, avoids any inhibition of cell growth.

## Description
Industrial Scale Process for the Production of Polyols by Fermentation of SugarsThe invention relates to an industrial scale process for the production of polyols, especially erythritol and or ribitol, by aerobic fermentation of a sugar with a sugar tolerant fungus such as Moniliella tomentosa var. pollinis.It is known that aerobic fermentation of a suitable sugar by the yeast like fungus Moniliella tomentosa var.pollinis will produce erythritol this was first reported by G.J. Hajny, J.H. Smith and J.C. Garver inApplied Microbiology 12, pp 240 246 May 1964 , who designated the microbe as Torula I 2A. Later, in Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 37, pp 107 118 1971 , L. Dooms,G.L. Hennebert and H. Verachtert classified the fungus asMoniliella tomentosa var. pollinis, and confirmed its ability to produce erythritol the authors also set forth a complete morphological description of the microbe which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, they recognised that Moniliella can exist under two forms, yeast and mould like forms, according, essentially, to the applied culture conditions on page 110 they state, On agar slants both forms are produced.In stationary liquid media the inould like form with abundant mycelium and more arthrospores than blastospores develops. In shake flask cultures, the yeast like form predominates with rounded, oval and rectangular cells produced by budding and by fission while no mycelium is formed .In translating these laboratory processes to an industrial scale, it is clearly necessary to maximise the yield of the desired product s . One significant factor which emerged from our investigations of the process was the concentration of the sugar in the reaction medium and by manipulating this concentration as hereinafter described, we found that the final polyol concentration in the fermentation medium could be increased.During our investigations of the process we did not observe any inhibition of the process by the polyols produced even in the range of polyol concentrations of 25 30 w v .Unfortunately, to achieve this high final product concentration, a starting sugar concentration of about 50 is necessary. When sugar concentrations higher than 35 were used, however, we found that growth of the microorganism was retarded, a fact which we attribute to the high osmotic pressure of the medium.The present invention comprises a process which enables a high final product concentration to be achieved and, at the same time, avoids any inhibition of cell growth. Accordingly, the present invention is an industrial process for producing polyols, especially erythritol and or ribitol, by the aerobic fermentation of a suitable sugar by Moniliella tomentosa var. pollinis in which the total amount of the sugar added to the fermentation medium is in the range 40 to 80 weight volume of the medium, the amount at the start of the fermentation being 20 to 35 and sugar being progressively added to the medium so that at the end of the fermentation, the total amount of sugar which has been added is at least 40 weight volume.Suitable sugars for use in the process are dextrose glucose , sucrose, fructose and maltoee, dextrose being particularly preferred.In a development of the process, we have found that, if the sugar for the fermentation is provided in the form of a starch hydrolysate, the fermentation medium may have a relatively large dry substance without the growth of the Moniliella tomentosa being inhibited. We attribute this effect to larger molecular weight components of the hydrolysate which generate a relatively lower osmotic pressure.In this development, a maltodextrin is added to the fermentation medium at the start of the fermentation at a concentration greater than 40 dissolved solids, the maltodextrin being progressively converted in situ to a sugar fermentable by the Moniliella tomentosa var. pollinis by including glucoamylase in the fermentation medium With this form of the invention, the sugar substrate is made available progressively in the fermentation medium by the activity of the glucoamylase enzyme.The desired products of the process according to the present invention are erythritol and or ribitol. Prior art workers have reported production of glycerol and arabitol, in addition to erythritol, from the fermentation of sugars byMoniliella tomentosa var. pollinis. In accordance with our process, no arabitol is produced, but ribitol, in addition to erythritol and glycerol is obtained, these three being the only polyols formed. Typically, the fermentation produces a product comprising ribitol, glycerol and erythritol in the following proportions, based on totaly polyols ribitol 1 20 glycerol 5 40 the balance being erythritol.Moniliella tomentosa var. pollinis is available at the CentraalBureau voor Schimmelcultures CBS , Baarn, The Netherlands, as CBS 461.67, and was also deposited and is available to the public at the Commonwealth Mycological Institute CultureCollection CMI cc , Ferry Lane, Kew, Richmond, SurreyTW9 3AF, United Kingdom, under the number CMI cc 271648.The microbial cells are cultivated on a solid medium con tailing malt extract 4 , yeast extract 0.2 and agar 2 . The culture so formed is then inoculated to a steril ised medium containing sugar and a nitrogen source. Throughout the specification and claims, all percentages and parts are by volume unless otherwise stated.Air is supplied to the fermentor at a rate which depends on the size of the fermentation vessel and the degree of agitation of the contents of the vessel, but is generally in the range of 0.1 to 1.5 litre air litre fermentation medium minute. For exarple, in a 2 litre vessel, the air flow rate was 1 litre litre minute at a stirrer speed of 400 to 800 rpm, while in a eO0 litre vessel, the rate was 0.5 to 1.0 litre litre minute without agitation other than that produced by the air flow. The fermentation is conducted at a temperature of between 250C and 320C, at a starting pH of between 3 and 6, preferably 4 to 5. The fermentation is stcpped when the sugar has been consumed. In the prior art process, as described by Hajny, various sources of nitrogen were described for use in the fermentation, for example, yeast extract, urea, corn steep liquor, malt sprouts, black strap molasses, malt extract and distillers dry solubles. In the process of the present invention good results are achieved with 0.5 yeast extract plus 0.18 urea or with 28 corn steep liquor plus 0.02 urea.The starting pH should be between about 3.0 and 6.0 which decreases to about 2.0 to 3.5 during the fermentation.According to L. Hanssens, A. Van Regenmortel and H.Verachtert, Applied Microbiology, Vol. 24, No.5, pp 831 833 November 1972 , laboratory fermentations held at different constant pH s result in substantial differences in yields of total polyols and erythritol. We have found that, when working with larger scale fermentations 2 litre fermentors or larger the total polyol and erythritol yields are less sensitive to starting pH within the 4.0 to 6.0 range.In order to avoid or minimise problems of contamination, a starting pH of 4 to 5 is preferred. The fermentation is conducted until all of the sugar has been consumed fermentation times will normally be between 4 and 12 days, depending upon the amount of sugar used , after which the culture is stopped and the cells are removed from the culture broth, e.g. by centrifuging. The cell free culture broth, which contains erythritol, ribitol and glycerol, can be used as such, with or without refining e.g. by ultrafiltration and demineralisation , for certain applications, e.g. in the polymer industry. The refined culture broth can also be concentrated to 60 to 80 dissolved solids and the erythritol crystallised therefrom, e.g. by the technique described by J.M. Roxburg, J.F.T. Spencer andH.R. Sallens, Canadian Journal of Technology, Vol. 34, pp 248 353 1956 .The liquor remaining after recovery of the erythritol crystals, which is also a mixture of non crystallised erythritol ribitol and glycerol, can also be used after appropriate treatment. The process according to the invention is advantageously carried out in the presence of the polysaccharide Xanthan gum which has the property of retaining the cells of theMoniliella tomentosa var. pollinis in the fermentation medium and reducing their loss via the foam which occurs during the fermentation. Preferably 100 to 500 ppm Xanthan gum may be present and excellent results are obtained with about 300 ppm. More gum may be used than is necessary for retaining the cells in the fermentation medium i.e. more than about 500 ppm but such excess is wasteful.The overall process is also improved by including in the fermentation medium a conventional antifoam agent.Synthetic antifoam agents e.g. silicone type or fatty alcohols are preferred over the natural e.g. lard oil products because they can be used in smaller quantities and the final fermentation broth does not need extensive refining for their removal. With most synthetic commercial antifoam agents, 200 300 or 400 ppm is sufficient for optimum foam control.The following examples are intended to illustrate the practice of the invention. Preparation of the seed culture 500 ml erlenmeyers containing 50 ml culture medium comprising 20 dextrose, 0.5 yeast extract, 0.1 urea and 300 ppm Xanthan gum were inoculated with a colony from a solid medium and cultivation was conducted for 3 to 4 days at a starting pH of 5, a temperature of 300C and under reciprocating agitation of 100 oscillations minute. These cultures could be used as such to carry out a fermentation or could be used to inoculate larger cultures for propagation of the biomass for larger fermentations.Example 1A 600 litre fermentor containing 450 litres fermentation medium comprising 32 dextrose, 2 corn steep liquor, 0.02 urea, 300 ppm SAG 471 antifoam a dimethylpolysiloxane fromUnion Carbide and 300 ppm Xanthan gum was inoculated with 9 of a seed culture. The air supply was 0.7 litre air per litre culture medium per minute. The starting pH was 3.9.From the fourth day to the ninth day the fermentor was fed continuously with dextrose and urea until the total amount of dextrose added to the fermentor was 50 by weight of the initial volume of the fermentation medium and the total amount of urea added to the fermentor was 0.1 .After 13 days, the dextrose was fully consumed and the final erythritol concentration was 16 and the total polyol concentration was 26.4 . Example 2Three 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks each contained 50 ml fermentation medium comprising 0.58 yeast extract, 0.1 urea and, respectively, 30 , 40 and 50 maltodextrin of dextrose equivalent D.E. 12. Each flask also contained 0.1 weight weight based on maltodextrin of glucoamylase. The flasks were inoculated with 9 of a seed culture and held at a temperature of 300C under a reciprocating agitation of 100 oscillations minute. The fermentations were conducted for 7, 10 and 14 days and, at the end of these times, the solutions were analysed.
