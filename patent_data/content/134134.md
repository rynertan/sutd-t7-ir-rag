# MINERAL SLURRIES

## Abstract
A pumpable slurry of material particles in water comprises coarse mineral particles having a particle size in the range 5 to 50 mm and fine mineral particles having a size less than 200 micron. The slurry contains 82 to 85 , preferably 83 85 , by weight of mineral particles based on the combined weight of the mineral particles and water. At least 30 by weight of the mineral particles are in the form of coarse particles, 10 to 40 by weight are in the form of fine particles and the balance to 100 by weight are intermediate sized particles. The mineral particles are preferably coal. Slurries of this concentration have special properties in that they are sufficiently fluid to be pumped through a pipeline, yet sufficiently solid when static to be handled by grabs and similar devices.
