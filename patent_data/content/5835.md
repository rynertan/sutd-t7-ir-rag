# Gelable aqueous mixtures of polyamide aliphatic polyaldehyde and metal hypohalite the resulting gel and rendering porous structures impermeable with the mixtures.

## Abstract
Aqueous solutions of amide polymers, such as polyacrylamide when treated with small amounts of a water soluble polyaldehyde and a hypohalite salt at an alkaline pH, react to form firm gels within a short time at ambient temperature. Such gels, which are stable under alkaline as well as acidic conditions, are usefully employed to plug porous subterranean formations, for grouting of leaking soil pipes or wells, and to otherwise render porous structures impermeable to the passage of liquids such as water.
