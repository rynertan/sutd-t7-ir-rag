# OPTICAL DISC.

## Abstract
An optical disc comprises a resin disc 1 a thin metal film 2 formed on either of the surfaces of the resin disc 1 a protective film 3 formed on the thin metal film 2 and which has a good adhesion to metals and a hard coating film 4 formed over the resin disc 1 or the protective film 3 and which has a higher crosslinking density than the protective film 3 as well as a higher surface hardness, so that the optical disc is difficult to damage when handled. The optical disc offers the following three effects the protective film 3 formed on the thin metal film 2 protects the thin metal film 2 and improves the corrosion prevention property thereof, as well as the adhesion to the hard coating film 4 .
