## Description
The present invention relates in general to the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids. In particular the present invention relates to a process for the hydrogenation of acetic and propionic acids in the presence of a catalyst comprising a noble metal of Group VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements and rhenium to produce respectively ethanol and propanol. The hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to produce the corresponding alcohol using supported Group VIII noble metal catalysts is known from, for example, USP A 4524225 USP A 4104478 GB A 1534232 GB A 1551741 and EP A 147219. Of the aforesaid patents, all except GB A 1534232 relate to the hydrogenation of C₄ and higher carboxylic acids and, in common with GB A 1534232, to operation in the liquid phase. Moreover, EP A 147219 represents an intervening publication in the sense that it was published after the priority date claimed for the subject application on an application claiming an earlier priority date than the subject application. GB A 1534232 relates to the production of alcohols by the catalytic hydrogenation of carboxylic acids, including acetic acid and propionic acid, at elevated temperature and pressure in the presence of water and or solvents using as catalyst palladium rhenium on a support, the palladium to rhenium weight ratio of the catalyst being in the range from 0.01 to 5 1. The process is operated at pressures in the range from 50 to 1000 atmospheres. The only processes exemplified are the hydrogenation of C₄ and higher dibasic acids at very high pressures. EP A 147219 describes the preparation of a Re Pd C catalyst by sequential impregnation with an intermediate reduction step. The catalysts and comparative examples described in EP A 147219 have carbon supports which comprise activated carbon, optionally calcined. We have found that operation of a Group VIII noble metal catalyst in the liquid phase suffers from the disadvantage that leaching of both rhenium and Group VIII noble metal from the catalyst can occur. Not only leaching of the catalytic metals but also undesirable leaching of oxide containing supports can occur. We have now suprisingly found that operation in the vapour phase provides high and comparatively long lived catalytic activity and selectivity at lower pressures than those previously employed. Furthermore, operation in the vapour phase substantially overcomes the leaching problem associated with liquid phase operation. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of either ethanol from acetic acid or propanol from propionic acid which process comprises contacting either acetic acid or propionic acid in the vapour phase with hydrogen at elevated temperature and a pressure in the range from 1 to 150 bar in the presence of a catalyst comprising as essential components i a noble metal of Group VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements, and ii rhenium. In addition to the alcohol, the process of the invention generally produces the corresponding ester as a by product, for example the hydrogenation of acetic acid generally also produces ethyl acetate and the hydrogenation of propionic acid generally also produces propyl propionate. The proportion of the ester in the product may be increased, if desired, by for example operating at low conversions, for example at less than 50 conversion per pass, or by introducing an acidic function into the catalyst to promote in situ esterification. Alternatively, the proportion of alcohol may be increased, for example by co feeding water or by operating at very high conversions per pass. Both acetic and propionic acids are commercially available in large tonnages and may be used in the process of the present invention in their commercially available forms without further purification. Alternatively, they may be further purified if desired. Hydrogen, too, is commercially available on a large scale and may be used with or without further purification. The catalyst comprises a first component which is a noble metal of Group VIII and a second component which is rhenium. For the avoidance of doubt, the noble metals of Group VIII are the metals osmium, palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium and iridium. Of the aforesaid metals of Group VIII, palladium and ruthenium are preferred. Preferably the catalyst further includes a support. Suitable supports include high surface area graphitised carbons, graphites, silicas, aluminas and silica aluminas, of which high surface area graphitised carbons and silicas are preferred. Preferred silica supports are those having a high surface area, typically greater than 50 m² g. Particularly preferred supports are the high surface area graphitised carbons described in GB A 2136704 BP Case No. 5536 . The carbon is preferably in particulate form e.g. as pellets. The size of the carbon particles will depend on the pressure drop acceptable in any given reactor which gives a minimum pellet size and reactant diffusion constrant within the pellet which gives a maximum pellet size . The preferred minimum pellet size is 0.5 mm and the preferred maximum is 10 mm, e.g. not more than 5 mm. The carbons are preferably porous carbons. With the preferred particle sizes the carbon will need to be porous to meet the preferred surface area charateristics. Carbons may be characterised by their BET, basal plane, and edge surface areas. The BET surface area is the surface area determined by nitrogen adsorption using the method of Brunauer Emmett and Teller J. Am. Chem. Soc. 60,309 1938 . The basal plane surface area is the surface area determined from the heat of adsorption on the carbon of n dotriacontane from n heptane by the method described in Proc. Roy. Soc. A314 pages 473 498, with particular reference to page 489. The edge surface area is the surface area determined from the heat of adsorption on the carbon of n butanol from n heptane as disclosed in the Proc. Roy. Soc. article mentioned above with particular reference to page 495. The preferred carbons for use in the present invention have a BET surface area of at least 100 m² g, more preferably at least 200 m² g, most preferable at least 300 m² g. The BET surface area is preferably not greater than 1000 m² g, more preferably not greater than 750 m² g The ratio of BET to basal plane surface area is preferably not greater than 4 1, more preferably not greater than 2.5 1. It is particularly preferred to use carbons with ratios of BET to basal plane surface area of not greater than 1.5 1. It is preferred to use carbons with ratios of basal plane surface area to edge surface area of at least 10 1, preferably at least 100 1. It is not believed that there is an upper limit on the ratio, although in practice it will not usually exceed 200 1. The preferred carbon support may be prepared by heat treating a carbon containing starting material. The starting material may be an oleophillic graphite e.g. prepared as disclosed in GB 1,168,785 or may be a carbon black. However, oleophillic graphites contain carbon in the form of very fine particles in flake form and are therefore not very suitable materials for use as catalyst supports. We prefer to avoid their use. Similar considerations apply to carbon blacks which also have a very fine particle size. The preferred materials are activated carbons derived from vegetable materials e.g. coconut charcoal, or from peat or coal or from carbonizable polymers. The materials subjected to the heat treatment preferably have particle sizes not less than these indicated above as being preferred for the carbon support. The preferred starting materials have the following characteristics BET surface area of at least 100, more preferably at least 500 m² g. The preferred heat treatment procedure for preparing carbon supports having the defined characteristics, comprise successively 1 heating the carbon in an inert atmosphere at a temperature of from 900 C to 3300 C, 2 oxidizing the carbon at a temperature between 300 C and 1200 C, 3 heating in an inert atmosphere at a temperature of between 900 C and 3000 C. The oxidation step is preferably carried out at temperatures between 300 and 600 C when oxygen e.g. as air is used as the oxidising agent. The duration of the heating in inert gas is not critical. The time needed to heat the carbon to the required maximum temperature is sufficient to produce the required changes in the carbon. The oxidation step must clearly not be carried out under conditions such that the carbon combusts completely. It is preferably carried out using a gaseous oxidizing agent fed at a controlled rate to avoid over oxidation. Examples of gaseous oxidising agents are steam, carbon dioxide, and gases containing molecular oxygen e.g. air. The oxidation is preferably carried out to give a carbon weight loss of at least 10 wt based on weight of carbon subjected to the oxidation step, more preferably at least 15 wt. The weight loss is preferably not greater than 40 wt of the carbon subjected to the oxidation step, more preferably not greater than 25 wt of the carbon. The rate of supply of oxidizing agent is preferably such that the desired weight loss takes place over at least 2 hours, more preferably at least 4 hours. Where an inert atmosphere is required it may be supplied by nitrogen or an inert gas. Suitably the catalyst comprises from 0.1 to 10 by weight Group VIII noble metal preferably from 0.5 to 5 by weight Group VIII noble metal and from 0.1 to 20 by weight rhenium, preferably from 1 to 10 by weight rhenium, the remainder of the catalyst comprising the support. The catalyst may be further modified by the incorporation of a metal or metals of Group IA, Group IIA or Group IVA, preferably by a metal of Group IA of the Periodic Table of the Elements. A suitable metal is potassium. The amount of the modifying metal s may suitably be in the range from 0.1 to 20 by weight based on the total weight of the catalyst. The addition of a modifying metal to the catalyst can have the advantageous effect that carbon carbon bond hydrogenolysis can be supressed to a greater or lesser extent during the hydrogenation, thereby improving the selectivity of the process to desired products. The catalyst may be prepared by a variety of methods. One method of preparing the catalyst comprises impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of soluble compounds of rhenium and the Group VIII noble metal which compounds are thermally decomposable reducible to the metal and or metal oxide. Impregnation may be by way of co impregnation or sequential impregnation, preferably by sequential impregnation. Sequential impregnation is preferably effected in the order Group VIII noble metal followed by rhenium. A preferred method of producing a catalyst for use in the process of the present invention comprises the steps of Water may suitably be employed as the solvent in step A and a lower alkanol, for example ethanol, may be used as the solvent in step B . The production of a catalyst in the aforesaid manner can avoid the palladium impregnated on the support in step A being leached to any appreciable extent in step B of the process. Another preferred method of producing a catalyst for use in the process of the present invention consists in The Group VIII noble metal on the support is heated in the presence of an inert gas, for example nitrogen. Heating in the presence of an inert gas is accomplished at an elevated temperature in the range from 150 to 350 C. In this embodiment of the invention it is not necessary that a solvent in which the Group VIII metal is substantially insoluble be used in step C of the process. Thus any suitable solvent may be used in steps A and C of the process. Suitable solvents include independently water and alkanols. An advantage of the heating step step B is that the noble metal of Group VIII is rendered less prone to leaching in step C of the process. Suitable Group VIII noble metals which are decomposable reducible to the metal include salts of the metals, for example carboxylates, nitrates and compounds in which the Group VIII noble metal is present in the anion moiety, for example ammonium tetrachloropalladate and ammonium tetranitropalladate. Suitable rhenium compounds which are decomposable reducible to rhenium metal and or oxide include dirhenium decacarbonyl, ammonium perrhenate and rhenium heptoxide. The metal of Group IA, Group IIA or Group IVA of the Periodic Table of the elements may be added to the catalyst composition at any point during its preparation. Thus, the supported palladium rhenium catalyst may be impregnated with a solution of a soluble compound of the metal. Alternatively, a soluble compound of the metal may be added to the co impregnation solution or either of the sequential impregnation solutions. A preferred catalyst comprises palladium and rhenium supported on a high surface area graphitised carbon of the type described in the aforesaid GB A 2136704. Contrary to the teaching of the aforesaid EP A 0147219 cf Comparison C regarding unacceptable selectivity losses and undesirable productivity losses in the hydrogenation of maleic acid when the average palladium crystallite size is 100 Angstroms or less, we have found that in the hydrogenation of acetic or propionic acids the catalyst selectivity and productivity is substantially independent of average palladium crystallite size in the range from 30 to 150 Angstroms. We may therefore use catalysts in which the average palladium crystallite size is in the range from 30 to 99.9 Angstroms. Before use in the process of the invention the catalyst is preferably activated by contact at elevated temperature with either hydrogen or a hydrogen inert gas, for example nitrogen, mixture for a period of from 1 to 20 hours. The elevated temperature may suitably be in the range from 200 to 350 C. Alternatively, the catalyst may be activated by heating to the reaction temperature in the presence of the reactants. Whilst the precise nature of the catalyst on the support can not be determined with any degree of confidence, it is believed that the Group VIII noble metal component is in the form of the elemental metal and the rhenium component is in the form of the elemental metal and or an oxide thereof. The process of the invention may suitably be operated at an elevated temperature in the range from 100 to 350 C, preferably from 150 to 300 C. The pressure may suitably be less than 50 bar. The process may be operated batchwise or continuously, preferably continuously. The catalyst may be employed in the form of a fixed bed, a moving bed or a fluidised bed. The Gas Hourly Space Velocity for continuous operation may suitably be in the range from 50 to 50,000 h ¹, preferably from 2000 to 30,000 h ¹. The process of the invention will now be further illustrated by reference to the following Examples. Catalysts were prepared according to the procedures outlined below. In the procedures, HSAG carbon denotes high surface area graphitised carbon, prepared and characterised as follows The carbon used as support was prepared from a commercially available activated carbon sold by Degussa under the designation BK IV. The activated carbon was heat treated as follows. The carbon was heated from room temperature in a stream of argon to 1700 C over a period of about one hour. When the temperature reached 1700 C the carbon was allowed to cool in the stream of argon to 25 C. The carbon was then heated in air in a muffle furnace at approximately 520 C for a time known from experience to give a weight loss of 20 wt. The carbon was then heated in argon to between 1800 C and 1850 C in argon. The carbon was allowed to cool to room temperature in an argon atmosphere. The resulting graphite containing carbon was then ground to 16 30 mesh BSS. The resulting carbon had the following properties In the following procedures nominal loading is defined as weight of For experiments at pressures in the range 1 11 barg, 2.5 mls of catalyst was loaded into a corrosion resistant stainless steel tube of internal diameter 6 7 mm, and the reactor tube assembly placed in a tubular furnace. The catalyst was then activated by heating at atmospheric pressure in a stream of hydrogen to either 280 or 300 C over a two hour period, and then holding at the final temperature for one hour. After activation, the catalyst was cooled in hydrogen to the desired reaction temperature. A mixture of carboxylic acid vapour and hydrogen was then passed over the catalyst, and pressure was adjusted to the required value by means of a back pressure regulator. The vapour hydrogen mixture was formed in a vapourising zone, to which acetic acid liquid and hydrogen gas were separately metered. The product vapours andgases leaving the reactor were sampled on line and analysed by gas liquid chromatography glc . For experiments conducted at 11 50 barg, a similar procedure and apparatus was used, except that the tube had internal diameter 10 mm, up to 10 mls of catalyst was employed, and products were passed to a condenser, and gas and liquid products were analysed separately, again by glc. In both procedures, temperature was measured by means of a thermocouple inserted into the catalyst bed. The product mixtures typically contained the appropriate alcohol and ester the latter formed by esterification of alcohol with unreacted acid , together with traces of the appropriate dialkyl ether, and aldehyde, and by product methane, ethane and with propionic acid only propane. In general, with carbon and silica supported catalysts, the main product is alcohol, especially at high conversions. For the purposes of the Examples, conversions and selectivities have been calculated as respectively, the proportion of carboxylic acid hydrogenated, and the proportion of the hydrogenated carboxylic acid which is not converted into alkane by product. Thus, selectivity denotes the ability of the catalyst to carry out hydrogenation without alkanation. In all examples unless stated otherwise only trace amounts 2 of dialkyl ether and aldehyde are formed. WHSV Weight Hourly Space Velocity kg liquid feed per kg catalyst per hour. LHSV Liquid Hourly Space Velocity litres liquid feed per litre of catalyst per hour. Productivity kg acid converted per kg catalyst per hour. Acetic acid was hydrogenated over the catalysts prepared in procedure The results show the benefit of sequential impregnation of Pd and Re Example 7 , and the poor performance of catalyst A4 Example 6 , which contains only palladium, and is not a catalyst according to the invention. The same procedure as in Examples 2 7 was followed, but using the catalysts prepared according to procedure The Catalyst of Example 13 is not according to the present invention, and is included for the purposes of comparison. The catalyst prepared by procedures The results show that within experimental error, catalysts of similar high activity may be generated using a range of sequential impregnation techniques. The procedure of Examples 14 17 was repeated using the catalyst prepared according to procedure The catalyst prepared by procedure The acetic acid conversion was 40 , with 96 selectivity. This corresponds to a productivity of 6 kg kgcat h acetic acid converted. Under similar conditions but with WHSV 3.6, conversion was 74 with 96 selectivity. The catalysts prepared by procedure The results show the beneficial effect of potassium in improving selectivity, and that catalysts H3 and H4 which are not according to the present invention, show very poor performance. Catalysts prepared by procedures The results show that sequential impregnation of Ru then Re yields better catalysts than sequential impregnation of Re then Ru. The catalysts prepared by procedure The catalyst prepared by procedure The catalyst prepared according to procedure B1 was used for the liquid phase hydrogenation of acetic acid. 1.01 g of the powdered catalyst was charged to a 100 ml stainless steel autoclave, along with 50.2 g of acetic acid. The autoclave was flushed and then pressurised with hydrogen to 100 barg, and heated with stirring to 200 C, at which temperature it was held for 6.0 hours. After cooling, the liquid phase product was removed and filtered, and analysed both for organic products and rhenium and palladium metals. The final pressure after cooling was 50 barg. The product was found to contain 27.9 wt ethyl acetate and 2 wt ethanol corresponding to a productivity of 1.5 kg kg cat h converted by hydrogenation . In addition, 16 of the rhenium and 0.06 of the palladium originally on the catalyst was found to have leached into solution. This example demonstrates that considerable leaching of rhenium can occur in the liquid phase hydrogenation of acetic acid. This is in contrast to reactions carried out in the gas phase, where no detectable loss of rhenium occurs. This is not an example according to the present invention because it was carried out in the liquid phase. It is included only for the purpose of comparison.
