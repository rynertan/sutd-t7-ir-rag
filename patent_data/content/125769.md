# SUPPORTED CATALYSTS

## Abstract
A supported catalyst comprising a catalyst component carried on a support in the form of a rigid inorganic foam made of one or more layer minerals, a process for the prepara tion of the catalyst by intoducing a catalyst component onto and or into a pre formed foam support or by incorporating a catalyst component in the foam support during production of the support and a process for carrying out a chemical reaction by contacting reactants in vapour or liquid form with the supported catalyst. The catalyst affords advantages in terms of one or more of low catalyst loading, reaction efficiency, yield and selectivity.
