## Description
LOW FAT SPREAD AND PROCESSBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to low fat spreads particularly, to spreads suitable as low calorie substitutes for butter and margarine, and to a process for preparing them. Low fat spreads are recognized as those having from 30 to less than 80 fat content. Typically, they are water in oil emulsions. Low fat spreads suitable for use as margarine substitutes are required to have certain flow or spread characteristics and should resist free oil or free water separation. And, they should otherwise simulate the characteristics of butter and margarine, including rapid melt on the tongue, good mouthfeel, fairly shiny appearance, good stability to heat such as when spread on hot foods, and freeze thaw stability. Among the most desirable low fat spreads are those which offer a significant fat and calorie reduction as compared to conventional margarine or butter. Diet margarines are generally recognized as having less than half of the normal fat content, thus less than half the calories of normal margarine which contains about 80 fat. Typical diet margarine products which contain 60 or more of an aqueous phase have been the source of considerable technical difficulty and investigation. The art is replete with prior art attempts to provide lowfat butter or margarine substitutes. Among these is U. S. patent 3,457,086 to Josefowicz et al, which teaches the production of a protein free spread which contains as low as 35 fat. The patent states that the observance of specified conditions is necessary to maintain the emulsion in the water in oil form. Unfortunately, products of this type tend to have a watery flavor because of their high water content and the absence of milk proteins which help impart the desirable butter like taste of margarine or butter, but which cannot be tolerated in the product because of their emulsion destabilizing effect. Moreover, the high water content tends to make emulsions of this type rapidly break down on hot foods, tending to make foods like toast become soggy and unappetizing.Moreover, while some consumers have found it convenient to buy large quantities of margarine or butter at sale prices and then freeze them, low fat spreads prepared by that and similar processes cannot tolerate freezing. Upon thawing, the emulsion breaks down with consequential release of its water phase. Typically, low fat spreads of the type disclosed byJosefowicz et al, cited above and Spitzer et al in U. S. patent 3,360,377, result in very tender emulsions when desirably low fat contents, on the order of about 40 , are employed. For example,Spitzer et al, which discloses examples A J of different suitable margarine oils, D and E being randomized coconut oil and coconut oil blends, emphasize the need for rapid cooling after homo genization to maintain emulsion stability, especially when lowerfat contents are employed. Spitzer et al disclose that 20 to about 55 oleaginous ingredients can be formed into an emulsion suitable for a margarine substitute when certain procedural constraints are observed.For example, in forming the emulsion, it is necessary to first form a coarse emulsion at a temperature within the range of around 800 to 1400F and then cool prior to forming a fine emulsion in a colloid mill at a temperature within the range of around 730 to 1130F. The temperature at which the chilied emulsion assumes an appropriate consistency is disclosed as generally within the range of from around 500 to 720F, for example 590F. These emulsions will not tolerate cooling in conventional scraped surface chilling processors at temperatures below 5O0F. Processing at temperatures of around SOOF or below results in breakdown of the emulsion. And, at temperatures in the 50o to 600F range, the emulsion becomes extremely stiff and heavy.The emulsions become so stiff and heavy that they often present problems of flow into the packaging container or physically exude free moisture from the mass. Further, like the products produced by Josefowicz et al, the emulsions of Spitzer et al cannot tolerate the presence of milk protein as conventionally employed in margarines and require elevated levels of emulsifiers, especially at low fat contents. Further exemplary of prior art low fat margarine processing is U. S. Patent 3,889,005 to Brammer et al. According to that disclosure, an emulsifier system consisting essentially of saturated fatty acid partial glycerides and unsaturated fatty acid partial glycerides is said to improve emulsion stability. However, evidence that low temperature working in a scraped surface chilling processor cannot he achieved is the statement in the examples that the product is worked and packed at 20 C 680F . At these temperatures, the crystal form of the solid fat will be predominantly in the beta form which results in large crystals, on the order of 25 to 50 microns.Apparently, these large crystals of fat and the high content of water in globules of 3 5 microns together create a stiffness at low temperatures in the chilled processor which ruptures the fat boundaries separating the water globules and causes emulsion breakdown. This is typical of known at low fat margarines based on water in oil emulsions. e S 152t 5 A further deficiency of many diet margarine products is that they cannot retain emulsion stability when subjected to freezing temperatures and then thawed. Typically, exposure to freezing temperatures and subsequent thawing results in coalescence of water droplets due to the expansion of the dispersed water during pre ice crystal formation and subsequent contraction upon thawing.The problem is especially acute in diet margarines because the water usually predominates over the fat in concentration, leaving s the fat highly stretched out and incapable of maintaining the weaver in dispersed form as it stretches and then contracts during the freeze thaw cycle. Some diet margarines have overcome this deficiency in freeze thaw performance by the addition of gelatins and gums to the dispersed water phase. Such diet margarines still, however, require scraped surface cooling at temperatures higher than S0 F, have poor stability at elevated temperatures, and wve an undesirable mouthfeel. In an effort to overcome the problems caused by the presence of protein and low fat content in low fat spreads, Bodor et al disclose in U. S. patent 4,103,037 the use of a gelling agent, such as gelatin, having a melting point sufficiently high to withstand room temperature yet low enough to allow it to melt in the mouth. This gelling agent ties up all available water into minute, solid p particles which are dispersed throughout a continuous fat pha sae. These multiple particles contain the water soluble flavors and ns salt, and diminish the flavor impact of these components. In further evidence of the poor stability of the currently available low fat spreads based upon water in oil emulsions, are several more recent patents which employ oil in water emulsions.Among these are U. S. patent 4,238,520 to Miller et al, which discloses an oil in water emulsion having stably dispersed therein about 208 to 40 fat and preferably employs from about 2 to 5 of a lipoidal emulsifier 0.5 to 3.25 of a thickening agent. In another approach, Bosco et al, U. S. patent 4,279,941 disclose a spread based upon an oil in water emulsion containing from 5 to 408 fat and employing hydrophilic emulsifiers in combination with stabilizing agents and fats having specified SFI profiles. While products of the types described in these patents do have advantages in terms of emulsion stability and the ability to employ protein, they are a departure from more typical margarine technology based upon water in oil emulsions, and thus require significantly different processing. There remains a need for a water in oiSbased low fat spread which has improved stability and provides an effective substitute for conventional margarine and butter under a broader range of conditions of storage and use. The following are aims of at least the preferred forms of the invention. It is an aim of the present invention to provide an improved low fat spread and a process for preparing it. It is a more specific aim of the present invention to provide an improved low fat, preferably butter flavored, spread and a process for preparing it, wherein the product is based upon a water in oil emulsion which provides an effective substitute for butter and conventional margarine under a broad range of conditions of storage and use. It is another specific aii of the invention to provide an improved low fat, preferably butter flavored, spread and a process for preparing it wherein the product is based upon a waterin oil emulsion and can include dairy proteins to enhance the flavor and nutrition of the product without adversely affecting emulsion stability. It is a further more specific aim of the present invention to provide a low fat, preferably butter flavored, spread and a process for preparing it, wherein the spread has a consistency in rheological properties which enables it to remain suitably firm at room temperature, but yet not unduly hard at refrigerator temperatures. It is yet a further specific aim of the invention to provide a low fat, preferably butter flavored, spread based upon a water in oil emulsion and a process for preparing it, wherein the product remains solid and easily spreadable at all temperatures within the range of from 320F to about 800F, yet melts down quickly in the mouth to release flavor without imparting a waxy mouthfeel and remains as a stable emulsion at temperatures typically encountered for hot food dishes. It is yet a further specific aim of the invention to provide a low fat, preferably butter flavored, spread based.upon a water in oil emulsion and a process for preparing it, wherein the emulsion remains stable during freeze thaw cycling. It is another aim of the present invention to provide a low calorie, preferably butter flavored, spread based upon a water in oil emulsion and a process for preparing it, wherein the spread is low in trans isomer content. It is another aim of the present invention to provide a low calorie, preferably butter flavored, spread based upon a water in oil emulsion and a process for preparing it, wherein the spread has a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids, preferably greater than 1.5 for stick type products and greater than 2.0 for soft or tub type products. It is another aim of the present invention to provide a low fat, preferably butter flavored, spread based upon a waterin oil emulsion and a process for preparing it, wherein the spread has a desirable surface sheen. It is another aim of the present invention to provide a process for preparing a low fat spread based upon a water in oil spread which enables low temperature working after emulsification to achieve a desirable polymorphic crystalline behavior which results in improved rheological properties. It is another specific aim of the present invention to provide a low fat, preferably butter flavored, spread and a process for preparing it, wherein the spread is based upon a waterin oil emulsion and provides a close simulation to the desirable attributes and characteristics of butter or margarine while presenting a caloric content significantly reduced therefrom The spread, in its broad aspects, comprises from about 30 to about 70 of a highly dispersed aqueous phase and from about 30 to about 70 of a continuous fat phase comprising a blend of from about 70 to about 95 by weight of a liquid vegetable oil and from about 5 to about 30 of a hardstock, the blend comprising from 10 to 30 of the fatty acids as C10, C12, C14 and C16 fatty acids and these fatty acids are predominantly in the trisaturated glyceride form1 the solid fat being present predominantly in the beta prime crystal form The hardstock preferably has an SFI solids content of at least 30 at 920F, being a randomly interesterified mixture of a saturated lauric acid fat and a second saturated edible oil, the mixture comprising said lauric acid fat and said second oil in the weight proportions of from about 90 10 to about 40 60. Preferably, the aqueous phase will be finely dispersed into globules of about one micron or less in diameter and the solid fat will be substantially completely in the beta prime form. The process according to the invention in its broad aspects comprises forming a liquid emulsion according to the above formulation, finely dispersing the aqueous phase within the fat phase to achieve a water in oil emulsion sufficiently stable to permit cooling under conditions effective to crystallize the hardstock in predominantly the beta prime crystal form without breaking the emulsion and cooling the emulsion under conditions effective to crystallize the solids content in predominantly the beta prime crystal form. Preferably, the aqueous phase is uniformly dispersed to a water globule size of approximately one micron in diameter. This enables cooling the emulsion in conventional scraped surface heat exchangers at temperatures of from 300F to about 550F to achieve predominantly beta prime crystalline fat formation.Most preferably, the exit temperatures will be below 50 F. Preferably, the dispersion of the aqueous phase and the subsequent cooling and crystallization are conducted under conditions effective to produce substantially all crystals in the beta prime form.Brief Description of the Drawing The invention will be better understood and its advantages will be more apparent when the following detailed description is read in light of the accompanying drawing wherein The Figure is a graph showing the results of a comparison of the penetration readings for a product produced according Example 1 to four current commercial diet margarines.Detailed Description of the Preferred Forms of the Invention According to the invention, it is now possible to formulate a diet margarine comprising vegetable oils, having surprisingly good rheological properties which include freeze thaw stability, negligible oiling off at 8O0F, a brighter gloss due to the extra light which is reflected from the finer crystals of the beta prime state, and a surprisingly good consistency of penetration values within the range of from 250 to 750F. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, evidence indicates that these properties may be attributed to the use of a defined type of hardstock with liquid vegetable oils and the fine dispersion of the aqueous phase which enable the achievement of a unique polymorphic behavior in the fat phase. The properties of the emulsion enable cooling at temperatures as low as 300F to permit the solidifying portion of the fat to crystallize in the beta prime form. It is believed that these crystals, typically needle shaped crystals of not more than one micron in length and much smaller than the beta crystals obtained at temperatures above 50 F, more typical of low fat spread processing, are permitted to slide past one another and past the finely dispersed water globules during cooling.Thus, it is believed that by maintaining particles of the fat in the beta prime form and the size of the water globules in a similarly small size, the particles of fat and water can move freely within a continuous liquid oil phase. The discontinuous solid fat and water portions remain of such a small size during coo ing and working that a consistency in rheological properties is achieved which essentially eliminates any tendency to break the emulsion as happens during the lowtemperature processing cOnventional low fat emulsions in scraped surface cooling equipment such as Votator heat exchangers of the A type. The particular composition of the continuous oil phase is also believed to contribute an unusually strong interfacial film which allows high shearing of the dispersed water phase in the emulsion preparation. This results in extremely fine and uniform water globule size which, due to the strong interfacial film of the continuous oil phase, does not allow coalescence of the water droplets. The present invention is directed to the production of lowcalorie, low fat spreads from 708 to 308 fat content, for both tub and stick margarine, having superior rheological properties such that they have penetration values within the accepted ranges for normal 80 fat margarine product, while remaining spreadable though frozen and possessing considerable body with minimal oil off at 800F. All percentages in this description are based on the weight of the subject component and weight of the total composition or a specifically identified portion thereof, unless otherwise indicated. Margarines are normally sold in two principle types, namely print, hard or stick, margarine and soft or tub margarine. Hard or stick margarine would have a firmness consistent with a penetration range of 65 to 123 being in units of 0.lmm using an ASTM grease cone at 450C according to the official method of theAmerican Oil Chemists Society AOCS , designated Cc 16 60. Soft or tub margarine, on the other hand, would have a firmness consistent with a penetration range of 130 to 210. The term fat as used herein is intended to include all edible, fatty acid triglycerides regardless of origin or whether they are solid or liquid at room temperature. Thus, the term fat includes normally liquid and normally solid vegetable and animal fats and oils. Where the term oil is employed herein, it is intended to refer to those fats which are normally liquid in their unmodified state. It is preferred that sufficient liquid oil of sufficiently high polyunsaturate content be employed to provide a ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids in the product of at least 1.5 in the case of stick type products and at least 2.0 in the case of soft or tub type products. The polyunsaturated fatty acids are defined as cis, cis methylene interrupted polyunsaturated fatty acids determined according to theCanadian Food and Drug Directorate Method FA 59 and confirmed by gas liquid chromotography. Accordingly, the fat phase will comprise a blend of liquid oil and hardstock, with the liquid oil comprising from 70 to 95 of the phase, preferably from 75 to 90 .In the case of soft spreads, the liquid oil content will be at least 80 , permitting the higher ratio of polyunsaturates to saturates. A wide variety of edible liquid vegetable oils may be used in formulating the edible fat portion of the low calorie, low fat spread. These include safflower oil, sunflower oil, soyabean oil, rapeseed or canola oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, linseed oil, and wheat germ oil. The hardstock is preferably a randomly interesterified mixture of a saturated lauric acid fat and a saturated second oil in proportions by weight of about 90 10 to about 40 60, preferably from about 80 20 to about 50 50. Suitable saturated fats may be obtained by hydrogenating, either in admixture or separately, or by fractionating a suitable fat. Suitable lauric acid fats are those selected from the group consisting of palm kernel oline, palm kernel oil, babassu nut oil, coconut oil, fractions of other lauric acid oils having fatty acid components similar to these, and mixtures thereof. Of these, babassu nut oil is preferred as described in my previous copending Canadian Patent Applications, numbers 354,417 and 354,377, filed on June 19, 1980.The fat products disclosed in these applications are substantially free of trans isomers and are high in polyunsaturates, being highly desirable for use in diet margarines. While it is impractical commercially to prepare a product having absolutely no determinable trans isomer content, the products of the invention preferably substantially eliminates trans isomer content. Preferred products are made under suitable controls to assure a trans isomer content of less than 1 . It is important in this regard that hydrogenation of the lauric acid oil and the second oil be carried out to an iodine value of less than 2. The term low trans isomer content is defined as meaning less than 1 trans isomer content.The trans isomer content is determined by infra red spectrophotometry according to the official method of the American OilChemists Society designated Cd 14 61. Typical of the second oil in the interesterified mixture are single oils or blends or fractions of oils including palm oil, and animal fats such as tallow. The desired low trans content cannot be achieved when the second oil comprises an unsaturated oil such as rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil or soybean oil however, they may be employed with this limitation. The random interegterification of the hardstock component from suitable saturated fats obtained by hydrogenation, in admix turn or separately, or by fractionating a suitable fat, is effected at an elevated temperature and under vacuum in the presence of a suitable catalyst. Preferably, after interesterification the product will have a solids content of not less than 30 at 920F as determined by the AOCS SFI method and preferably a Wiley Melt Point of about 108 F to 1200F. Completion of the interesterification reaction of the lauric palmitic mixture is usually determined by a 100F lowering of the melt point of the product as compared to the mixture prior to interesterification. It is possible to form the hardstock by first interesterifying the specified oils and then hydrogenating. Such a procedure is less preferred since completion of the interesterification is less susceptible to precise determination than in the case where the interesterification is effected after saturation of the materials. The combined fat phase will preferably comprise a predominant proportion of C10, C12, C14, C16, and C18 fatty acids such that its crystalline tending behavior is oriented toward the betaprime state. The preferred distribution of fatty acid chain lengths will be as follows C10 .5 3 C12 2 11 C14 .5 3 C16 7 138 C18 70 90 with the proportion of CID, C12, C14, C16 fatty acids being predominantly in the trisaturated glyceride form. This permits achievement of the beta prime crystalline form while maintaining solids contents which provide a desirable product texture and yet permit cooling under beta prime tending temperatures without breaking the emulsion. The fat phase will preferably have a relatively constant level of solids at the desired temperatures of use. In addition to the above criteria, it is therefore preferred that the product exhibit a solid fat index SF1 with certain ranges. The SFI relates to the proportion of solid triglycerides in the oil as measured under specified conditions. It is calculated from dilatometer measurements as described in AOCS tentative method Cd 10 57. The best stick and soft products of the invention will be made from fat blends having the following SFI values Solids 8 Temperature Stick Soft 500F 13 15 8 10 700F 8 10 6 8 800F 5 7 4 6 920F 2 3 1.5 2.5 Less preferred products would have SFI values which vary by as much as about 2 on either side of the various values given above. The fat blend employed according to this invention may be initially emulsified in conventional manner. However, the emulsion can tolerate higher levels of protein and achieves greater stability at low emulsifier levels than typical known low fat spreads. These advantages are believed to be achieved in part by the use of the fat phase described above, and in part by the physical state of the emulsion achieved due to the improved process. The aqueous phase is formed in conventional fashion by blending water with such typical ingredients as salt, proteinaceous materials such as skim milk powder, whey protein, casein, sodium caseinate or soy protein preservatives such as potassium sorbate, benzoic acid, calcium disodium EDTA hydrophilic colloids such as alginates, xartham, crob bean, or other vegetable gums and flavorants such as citric acid, lactic acid, and artificial or natural flavors. The emulsion will contain sufficient levels of suitable emulsifiers such as mixed fatty acid raonoglycerides mixed fatty acid diglycerides mixtures of fatty acid mono and diglycerides lipophilic polyglycerol esters lecithin glycerol esters, such as glyceryl monooleate, glyceryl dioleate, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl distearate, glyceryl monopalmitate, and glyceryl dipalmitate lactylated esters such as glyceryl lacto esters of fatty acids propylene glycol esters, such as propylene glycol monopalmitate, propylene glycol monostearate, and propylene glycol monooleate sorbitan esters, such as sorbitan monostearate, sorbitan trioleate, sorbitan tripalmitate, sorbitan tristearate, and sorbitan sesquioleate fatty acids or their soaps such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid and mixtures thereof. There is no known criticality in the use of any particular emulsifier.Thus, it is fully intended that other equivalent materials can be employed with satisfactory results. The emulsifiers will be employed separately or in combination at levels effective to achieve and maintain a stable emulsion. Typical levels will be in the range of from about 0.25 to about 1.5 . Standard composition of calorie reduced margarines in Canada specifies a maximum in combination of 0.5 . The fat and aqueous phases are mixed at a temperature of from 1000 to 1400F to form an emulsion. The admixture is then subjected to high shear to form a tight emulsion with the water globules finely dispersed within a continuous fat phase. The globules of water are reduced to a size effective to maintain the emulsion in stable form, without breaking, when processed under conditions effective to crystallize the solid fat portion of the. fat phase in predominantly the beta prime crystalline form. Preferably, the water globules will permit substantially complete crystallization of solid fat in the beta prime form. Most preferably, the water globules will be reduced to a size of one micron or less in diameter. Dispersion of the water into the fine globules can be achieved in any manner suitable. The preferred apparatus, however is of the type described in U. S. Patent 4,142,806 and CanadianPatent 1,038,370 wherein the loose emulsion is fed tangentially into a chamber wherein it is caused to flow in a spiral motion, from the inside wall toward the center, constantly creating shear within the emulsion at all points within the chamber. Preferably a unit of this type, referred to by its manufacturer GaulinCorporation as a Gaul in Hydroshear system, is used to recirculate emulsion maintained within a holding tank. In this configuration, the contents of the tank will preferably be recirculated about every 15 minutes. If desired, suitable colloid mills can also be employed to achieve the tight emulsion.Typically, however, dairy homogenizers of the type employing a plurality of stages at high pressures to achieve mechanical shear by enforcing the admixture of fat and aqueous phases though a narrow orifice, tend to provide inconsistent results. The high pressures required by this equip ment to achieve the requisite small globule size for the low temperature emulsion stability necessary to achieve beta prime crystal formation, tend to invert the emulsion. However, their use is not ruled out where they can be properly regulated to achieve the desired results. After emulsification, the emulsion is cooled under conditions effective to crystallize the solid fat portion of the emulsion predominantly, and preferably substantially completely, the beta prime crystalline form. This can be accomplished by the use of scraped surface heat exchangers, such as Votator A units, sometimes referred to as scraped surface chilling tubes, operatedAt suitably low temperatures. Typically, a series of two or threeVotator ZA zupits will be employed to reduce the temperature of the emulsion to within the range of from about 300 to about 55oF. Preferably, the emulsion is worked up to form a stable, fluid emulsion which emerges from the chilling apparatus at a temperature of less than 500F. The product is then caused to flow into tub shaped packages or to resting tubes prior to packaging into stick or pat form. The present invention will be illustrated further by the following examples and by reference to Figure 1 which is a graph showiry the penetration values plotted as a curve of penetration against temperature. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts are by weight. EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates the formation of a soft,localorie spread with a fat content of 40 and suitable for tub fill according to the invention. Palm kernel oline and palm oil in a 70 30 proportion were hydrogenated at 3000F using a suspension of 0.2t nickel catalyst 26 Ni , to an iodine value of less than 2.0 to form t saturated product of melt point 1220F. The hydrogenated material was filtered to remove the nickel and steam stripped under vacuum to decrease the free fatty acid content below about 0.03 wt . Under a high vacuum of 2 3mm Hg, the mixture was heated to 2500F, and 0.058 sodium methoxide catalyst added with intense agitation for 15 minutes. A sample of product was analyzed to confirm that interesterificationwas complete, as determined by a 100F lowering of the melt point as compared to the mixture prior to interesterification.The temperature of the reaction mixture was decreased to 1800F and 0.4 wtZ of a 30 aqueous solution of magnesium sulphate in hot water was added to destroy residual catalyst The temperature was then raised to 2100F and 1 bleaching earth was added to bleach the product. Thereafter the interesterified material was cooled and filtered. The hardstock product was found to have an SFI solids value of 36 at 920F and a Wiley Melt Point of 1120F. The hardstock described was mixed in a proportion 16 84 with liquid sunflower oil to form the fat portion of the following formula OIL PHASE Oil blend 39.00 Lecithin 0.20 Monoglycerides 0.50 Vitamins Color 0.009 AQUEOUS PHASE Water 57.62 Salt 2.00 Whey Powder 0.50 Potassium Sorbate 0.07 Citric Acid 0.001 Alginate 0.10 The fat phase was added first to an emulsion feed tank heated to 1250F and circulated through a Gaul in Bydroshear unit. The water phase was heated to 1250F and added to the emulsion feed tank with circulation continuing through the Gaulin Bydroshear unit.The material in the tank was fully circulated through the Hydroshear unit about every 15 minutes. The emulsion was supercooled through two Votator scraped surface chill tubes, then through a worker tube, and finally through a third scraped surface chill tube emerging at 46 20F to be filled into tubs. The resulting soft diet margarine spread readily, did not exhibit oil or water separation during processing or subsequently at room temperature and had good mouth break. In addition, the product had excellent freeze thaw stability when cycled for 48 hour periods at 250F and 800F. Superior rheological properties of the resulting low calorie spread are evidenced by the following penetration data comparing the product of this example to four commerciallyavailable low calurie spreads. Penetrations were conducted with an ASTM grease cone measuring units of O.lmm at temperatures of 250F representing freezer temperatures, 450F representing refrigeration temperatures, and 750F representative of room temperatures.The data is as follows TABLE I 250F 450F 750F 1 Diet Weight commat 130 147 285 2 Miracle Diet R 113 138 300 3 Imperial Diet R 138 180 285 4 Parkay Diet R 135 135 380 5 Patent Example 1 155 155 235 Such a range of penetration values shows a product consistency softer than similar products in the market place at the low temperatures yet firmer than similar products at warmer temperatures. This phenomenon can be readily seen when the penetration values are plotted as a curve of penetration against temperature and compared against such curves for similar products as seen in the accompanying drawing. The presence of the solid fat in the beta prime crystal state has been shown by X ray defraction photography. The defraction pattern produced shows defraction lines of 4.20 and 3.80 angstrom units which supports the conclusion that the fat crystals were exclusively in the beta prime crystal form. EXAMPLE 2 This example illustrates the formation of a hard,low calorie spread with a fat content of 40 and suitable for stick or pat form according to the invention. Palm kernel oline and palm oil in 75 25 proportion were hydrogenated at 3000F using a suspension of 0.2 nickel catalyst 26t Ni to an iodine value of less than 2.0 to form saturated product of melt point 1190F. The hydrogenated material was filtered to remove the nickel and steam stripped under vacuum to decrease the fatty acid content below about 0.03 wt . Under a high vacuum of 2 3mm Bg, the mixture was heated.to 250 F and a 0.05 sodium methoxide catalyst added with intense agitation for 15 minutes. A sample of product was analyzed to confirm that interesterification was complete as determined by a 100F lowering of the melt point as compared to the mixture prior to interesterification. The temperature of the reaction mixture was decreased to 1800F and 0.4 wt. of a 30 aqueous solution of magnesium sulphate in hot water was added to destroy residual catalyst. The temperature was then raised to 210OF and 1 bleaching earth was added to bleach the product.Thereafter the interesterified material was cooled and filtered.The hard stock product was found to have an SFI solids value of 34 at 920F and a Wiley Melt Point of 109 F. The hardstock described was mixed in a proportion 25 75 with liquid sunflower oil to form the fat portion of the following formula FAT PHASE Oil Blend 39.00 Lecithin 0.20 Monoglycerides 0.50 Vitamins 5 Color 0.009 AQUEOUS PHASE Water 57.62 Salt 2.00 Whey Powder 0.50 Potassium Sorbate 0.07 Citric Acid 0.001 Alginate 0.10 The fat phase was added first to the emulsion feed tank, heated to 1250F and circulated through a Gaul in Hydroshear unit. The water, phase was heated to 1250F and added to the emulsion feed tank with circulation continuing through the Gaul in Hydroshear unit. The emulsion was supercooled through three Votator scrapedsurface chill tubes then to cycled resting tubes emerging at 46 2 F in state suitable for forming into pats or sticks. The resulting stick diet margarine spread readily, did not exhibit oil or water separation during processing or subsequently at room temperature and had a good mouth break. The stick diet margarine had a penetration value of 120 being in units of O.lmm using an ASTM grease cone at 450F.
