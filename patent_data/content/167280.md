## Abstract
A percussion instrument includes drum body 13 and a percussion head 19 movable with respect to and stretch ed over the drum body 13 . A master tensioning member 55 is provided for pulling the drumhead 19 downward to enable a musician to vary the pitch of the sound produced when the drumhead 10 is struck. The master tensioning member 55 is operatively coupled to the drumhead 19 and is adaptable for use with drumheads of varying size. A lever system is provided for moving the master tensioning member vertically downwardly. A foot pedal 336 is pro vided for enabling the user to actuate the lever system. The pedal 336 includes an engaging tooth 182 and is swivel able to engage and disengage the tooth with complementary teeth to lock the pedal 336 selectively in position. The pedal tooth thereby permits the user to adjust and fix the tension on the drumhead. The pedal is connected to the lever system by a movable fulcrum, 252, 258 which permits the user to exert a smooth, even force when depressing the pedal and actuating the lever system.
