# Cavity rivet installation.

## Abstract
A cavity rivet 10 is installed using a tool 18 having a frustum shaped anvil portion 22 that deforms or upsets an annular wall forming the cavity 16 in the end of the rivet. The tool 18 also has an anvil pin 20 that is inserted into the rivet cavity 16 to prevent the deformed material from entering the cavity 16 while the frustum 22 deforms the rivet material. This forces the deformed material to take the shape directed by an anvil head portion 22 surrounding the frustum 22 . Con trolling the force which the anvil pin 20 exerts on the rivet cavity 16 and controlling the size of the cavity 16 in the rivet 10 limits the expansion of the rivet shank 15 as the de formed rivet head 13 is formed.

## Description
CAVITY RIVET INSTALLATION This invention pertains to the art of riveting, particularly in the aircraft industry. In the early days of metal aircraft, the aluminum structures were fastened together by rivets composed of relatively soft aluminum alloys. Later developments allowed the use of harder and stronger aluminum alloys and eventually extended to include the use of even harder, non aluminum materials such as titanium and stainless steels. Conventional wisdom has always sought to have an interference fit between the rivet and the material being fastened. The interference fit was particularly felt necessary when the rivet was to be placed in shear. This interference fit was not necessarily achieved by forcing an oversized rivet through predrilled holes. More commonly, the shank of the rivet was allowed to expand when the head of the rivet was deformed or upset during installation. The shank expansion removed all clearance and resulted in the desired interference fit. The use of interference fits on the rivets resulted in installation problems since the expansion of the rivet tended to expand the material immediately surrounding the rivet hole. This material expansion in turn tended to bow the riveted sheets if there were any substantial number of, aligned rivets in the sheet. While various manufacturing techniques could be used to minimize this bowing problem, these techniques still resulted in the accumulation of residual stresses in the riveted structure. There thus exists a need for a riveting technique which will not result in accumulated stresses. The force required to deform or upset a solid rivet increases almost linearly with respect to the upset deformation. The use of harder materials in rivets required a greater force to upset the rivets. The use of large forces in turn increased the likelihood of damaging the softer material being fastened by the rivets. There was no readily convenient way to determine when the solid rivet had been sufficiently upset so as to form a secure bond. The result was the need to develop expensive equipment to install solid rivets made of hard material, or alternately, to risk damaging the material being riveted. There thus exists the need for simple riveting techniques which can install high strength rivets without damaging the substrates being riveted. One method of alleviating the need for high forces to upset rivets made of hard materials is disclosed in UnitedStates Patent No. 4,007,540, by Tyree. The Tyree patent discloses the use of a cavity in the upset end of the rivet so that less force was required to upset the rivet. The Tyree patent still teaches against the use of clearance fits between the rivet and the riveted structure. While Tyree s device reduces the amount of bow introduced into a riveted structure, it does not eliminate that deformation. Another patent addressed to upsetting cavity type rivets is United States Patent No. 4,355,531, to Roman. The Rosman patent teaches the use of a two part rivet whereby a core pin is placed in a rivet cavity to limit inward flow of the upset end which encapsulates the core pin. Varying the size of the core pin also facilitates, the use of one rivet for use with panels of various thickness. The use of a two piece rivet is cumbersome and time consuming if the core pin is lost or fits improperly. If the core pin is improperly sealed during upsetting, then it is prone to vibration and abrasion of the surrounding rivet. Modern technology has developed numerous composite materials such as graphite epoxy composites, which are gaining importance for use in the aircraft industry.These composites are, however, relatively soft in their transverse or thickness direction. Thus, even soft, solid titanium rivets are hard with respect to many composites and improper installation of the rivets often damages the composites. Interference fits between the rivets and the holes in the composite also cause the composites to delaminate thereby weakening the structure. Since conventional riveting procedures result in expansion of the shank during installation, conventional riveting techniques are unsuitable for use with composites.Conventional riveting techniques also result in localized deformation of the work piece in the immediate vicinity of the upset end of the rivet. Since such deformation tends to delaminate the top layer of the composite.Conventional riveting technology is largely unsuitable for use with composites. There thus exists a need to develop rivet techniques suitable for use with composite materials. Many common composites are also extremely sensitive to corrosion. Titanium and several titanium alloys provide the least corrosive fasteners for use with many composites. Several alloys, such as K Monel, are also suitable, although slightly corrosive. The major problem with all of these noncorrosive materials is that they tend to be hard materials requiring a large amount of force to upset and seat the rivets. The large force in turn increases the likelihood of damaging the softer substrates, especially if they are fragile composites. A need exists to develop techniques to install such rivets in fragile composite substrates. The use of cavity rivets as disclosed by Tyree andRosman can help alleviate the problems somewhat, but even they result in unacceptable shank expansion and deformation of the composites at the upset end. There thus exists a need for a rivet which has a controllable shank expansion during installation whose formation of the upset head will not damage the substrate and which can be installed with a low upsetting force. The present invention concerns an installation tool and procedure that results in the controlled deformation or upset of a cavity rivet head at a relatively low and constant force without damage to the substrate being riveted. Briefly described, the tool of this invention forms rivet heads on rivets having a head, a shank, and a cavity in one end of the rivet. The tool has a projecting frustrum for deforming the cavity end of the rivet. A projecting member slidably extends through an aperture in the frustrum to be inserted into the cavity in the rivet when the tool is properly aligned with the rivet. The projecting member insures outward collapse of the cavity end of the rivet during deformation. A resilient member urges the projecting member through the aperture while allowing retraction of the projecting member as it is forced back through the aperture by contact with the bottom of the rivet cavity.The force exerted by the projecting member on the bottom of the rivet cavity cooperates with the force exerted by the tool on the cavity end of the rivet, and further cooperates with the size and location of the cavity in the rivet to insure that the deformed head begins formation at a desired location on the shank of the rivet and that the deformed, head is properly formed. The diameter and depth of a cavity in the end of the rivet opposite the preformed head affect the amount of force required to upset the cavity end of the rivet and allow the use of a far lower upsetting force than required for solid rivets. The cavity depth also affects the formation of the upset rivet head and in particular it affects the manner in which the material adjacent the rivet hole is deformed. If properly designed and installed, the cavity end buckles out and down during upsetting, with a fairly sharp transition between the solid shank and the cavity end of the rivet, thus minimizing the deformation of the top surface of the riveted substrate. Finally, the cavity depth affects the amount of shank expansion as the rivet is upset.If the cavity is too shallow, part of the shank is upset, if too deep, there is either not as sharp a demarcation between the shank and the upset head as is desirable or the external surface of the substrate adjacent the upset end is deformed. The rivet used in this invention controls these factors in a new and advantageous manner. It is also possible to work harden the rivet shank in order to help control the permanent expansion of the shank and to facilitate upsetting of the only non work hardened, cavity end of the rivet. Yet another variation is to undercut the shank diameter by a controlled amount to provide for either a predetermined clearance between the rivet and the substrate, or to provide for a controlled fit for a predetermined amount of shank expansion during rivet upsetting. The installation tool has an anvil pin which is inserted into the cavity of the rivet in order to insure outward collapse or buckling of the cavity end of the rivet as the rivet is upset. The upsetting tool also includes a truncated cone or frustum surrounding the pin. Thus, the anvil pin centers the tool and causes the.annular portion of the cavity rivet to collapse outward as the frustum upsets the cavity end of the rivet. Depending upon the type of upset head which is desired to be formed, the frustum may be recurved upon itself to control the expansion and shape of the upset head. This recurved portion of the frustum can take the form of a radially expanding cone which begins at the base of the frustum and whose largest diameter is towards the end of the upsetting frustum. The angle of recurvature affects not only the shape of the upset head, but also affects the amount of force required to upset the rivet. This upsetting tool can be used in standard rivet guns or adapted for use in squeezer assemblies. Since the cavity in the end of the rivet results in a tubular or annular column which buckles during upsetting, the upsetting force can be almost constant during upsetting.Once the upset is near completion, the force begins to increase substantially, thereby providing an easy means for determining when the upsetting process has been completed. The use of a relatively low and constant upsetting force thus minimizes the damage to the substrate through which the rivet extends. Proper design of the upsetting tool will also insure that the upset material is always placed between the tool and the substrate and thereby minimize the chance that the tool will strike and damage the substrate. These and other advantages of the present invention may best be understood through reference to the drawings in which FIGURE 1 shows the rivet of this invention about to be upset by the installation tool FIGURE 2 shows the rivet of this invention upset by the installation too FIGURE 3 shows the head of an upset rivet of this invention FIGURE 4 shows a typical headed rivet installed in a composite substrate FIGURE 5 is a cross sectional view of the installation tool FIGURE 6 shows a double flush installation of the rivet of this invention FIGURE 7 shows the head of the installation tool of this invention used to form the double flush rivet configuration as shown in FIGURE 6 and FIGURE 8 shows an alternate embodiment of the rivet of this invention having a reduced diameter shank. As shown in Figure 1, an installation tool 18 is aligned with, but not yet upsetting a rivet 10 . An anvil pin 20 is aligned to coincide with a cavity 16 in the end of rivet 10 . Figure 2 shows installation tool 18 forming an upset head on rivet 10 . Rivet 10 is shown inserted into a hole 9 through structural substrates 11 and 12 . The rivet 10 can have any conventional preformed head 10a and is shown with a flush mounted, counter sunk head in Figure 1 for purposes of illustration, not limitation. The preformed head serves to define the maximum insertion position of the rivet, which in turn defines the extent to which the cavity end 14 of the rivet projects above the adjacent substrate 11 . The rivet 10 of Figures 1 and 2 is shown in a clearance condition so that there is a space between the shank 15 and the substantially parallel, adjacent substrates 11 and 12 . If the substrates 11 and 12 are metal, such as aluminum, this clearance condition is typically undesirable and would be eliminated by eitr.e. sizing the rivet 10 for a snug fit in the hole 9 through the substrates 11 and 12 , or alternately, for an interference fit before insertion or after upsetting is completed. If the substrates 11 and 12 are made of a composite material, such as graphite epoxy composite, it is desirable to maintain either a clearance fit as shown in Figure 1, or at most, a snug fit, even after installation is complete. An interference fit is not desirable with composites since it promotes delamination of the composite layers. It should be understood that the invention is not limited to securing two sheets together as illustrated inFigure 1, but rather can be used to secure any number and any type of members to each other. Two sheets are shown merely for convenience of illustration, and not by way of limitation. Similarly, while this invention was developed in the environment of the aerospace industry, it can of course be used wherever an appropriate rivet is used to secure at least two members or objects together. The shape of the cavity 16 in the end of rivet 10 is typically cylindrical. The cavity 16 is typically concentric with the longitudinal axis of the rivet shank 15 . Thus the more common shape of cavity end 14 is tubular. The cavity 16 as shown in Figure 1 has a conical end 16a which would result if the cavity were drilled. The exact shape of the bottom of the cavity depends upon the method used to form the cavity, although a flattened bottom is preferable from a strength viewpoint. The cavity can be formed by any conventional method such as drilling, broaching, or integral casting.The exact method used to form the cavity 16 varies with the particular material used since the hardness of the material may control the most economical method of manufacture. It is desirable that the cavity 16 introduce the least practicable stress concentration into the upset rivet as such stress concentration could lead to premature failure of the riveted connection. The depth of the cavity 16 varies with the diameter of the rivet 10 , with the material used in the rivet, and with the type of upset head which is to be formed. Experimentation has shown that for materials such as titanium columbium TiCb alloys, or K Monel, having a shear strength in the neighborhood of 5O, 000 psi, the depth of the cavity 16 can be as much as .015 inches above or below the level of the adjacent substrate 1t , without significant damage to relatively fragile substrates. For a cavity 16 having a conical bottom as illustrated in Figure 1, the cavity depth is measured from the end of the cylindrical side walls, not from the end of the conical bottom of the cavity. If the bottom of cavity 16 is too far below the surface of the adjacent substrate 11 , the strength of shank 15 is lessened and there is a less sharply defined location for the initial lateral expansion of the deformed or upset head 13 . If the bottom of cavity 16 is too far above the surface of the adjacent substrate 11 , not only is part of the shank 15 upset, but the upset material tends to recurve around the shank 15 of the rivet 10 . This radical recurvature tends to over work the upset material causing it to split or splay it also forms stress concentrations adjacent to the shank which lead to premature failure of the rivet and it also forms a weaker interface with the adjacent substrate 11 , than would normally occur.It has been found that for TiCb alloy rivets having a shear strength in the neighborhood of 50,000 psi, and for rivet dimensions of Table I, shown below, the cavity depth should extend not more than about .015 inches above or below the surface level of the adjacent substrate 11 . The letters A, B, and C refer to rivet cavity end dimensions illustrated on the rivet shown in Fig. 8. For double flush mounting as shown in Figure 7, and for rivet dimensions of Table II, shown below, using K monel, experimentation has shown that the depth of cavity 16 should not be above the surface level of the adjacent substrate 11 , nor below the depth of the counter sunk hole in the substrate 11 . Too deep of a cavity weakens the rivet 10 and degrades the aerodynamic surface of the rivet head.An insufficient cavity depth upsets the rivet shank 15 and also results in an improperly formed upset head 13 which is not flush. The typical upset rivet head 13 formed by this invention is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. Note that there is relatively little deformation of the substrate 11 immediately adjacent to the upset head 13 of rivet 10 . The deformation to the substrate 11 is minimized because the cavity end 14 buckles outward and down onto substrate 11 , while the shank 15 remains relatively constant in diameter. Thus, there is a fairly sharp demarcation between the upset head and the shank 15 .The depth of cavity 16 with respect to the adjacent substrate 11 affects this sharp demarcation as previously mentioned. Also note that in the upset head condition of Figure 3, there still remains a cavity 16 , but that the cavity wall now essentially comprises two parts having somewhat of a frustum conical shape and having approximately equal height F, rather than one continuous cylinder as shown in Figure 1. Figure 4 shows the typical condition which results when a solid rivet is installed on a relatively soft composite substrate using conventional techniques. The lower edge of the upset head 4Oa of rivet 40 has a more gradual radius 40a than the rivet of Figure 3. The rivet shank 45 shown in Figure 4 lacks a well defined location where the upset head begins to form. Thus there is a more gradual formation of the upset head which causes at least the area 41a of the substrate 41 immediately adjacent to the upset head 40a , to be laterally deformed. If the substrates 41 and 42 are composites1 as shown in Figure 4, this lateral deformation of the head tends to delaminate the composite. The expansion of shank 45 using conventional riveting techniques also causes delamination of the composite layers as illustrated 41b and 42b . The rivet installation tool 18 of this invention is shown in Figure 5 in greater detail. The tool includes an elongated tubular member 19 having an enlarged cylindrical anvil head 21 . The outer axial end of the head 21 has a conical depression 24 having a frustum 22 projecting axially outwardly at its center. The smaller diameter of the frustum extends outwardly while the larger diameter or base blends or recurves into the smaller diameter portion of the depression 24 , with the walls of the depression flaring radially outwardly and axially. The cross section profile of the depression in the upsetting tool head 19 resembles a flattened W with the frustum 22 forming the middle two legs of the W. The frustum 22 has a central aperture 23 through which anvil pin 20 slideably extends.Spring 28 extending between a plug 30 and the pin 20 preloads anvil pin 20 into a projecting position, yet allows the pin to be forced further into the hole in the frustum 22 , if a force is exerted on the pin 20 which is greater than that of the spring 28 . An annular shoulder 20a on the pin engages a corresponding shoulder 19a on the member 19 to stop or limit axial projection of the pin. The anvil pin 20 is sized so that it fits within the rivet cavity 16 to insure that the material in the cavity end 14 collapses or buckles outward as the cavity end 14 is deformed or upset to form the rivet head. If the anvil pin 20 is too large, the cavity end 14 will grab or bind the pin 20 during upsetting and prevent movement of pin 20 into the upsetting tool 18 . If anvil pin 20 is too small, it will not adequately support the tubular walls of cavity end 14 . The anvil pin 20 also helps to position the installation tool over the rivet 10 . This positioning not only prevents inadvertent damage to the substrate 11 and 12 , but also assures frustum 22 is correctly aligned with the rivet 10 so that uniform column buckling of the cavity end 14 can occur. The frustum 22 initiates outward buckling and collapse of the cavity end 14 of the rivet 10 . As seen from Fig. 1, the diameter of the outer, smaller end of the frustum is about equal to the inner diameter of the rivet cavity. The included angle of the frustum 22 and the design of the adjacent portion 24 of the installation tool head 19 determines the size and shape of the upset rivet head. Preferably, the included angle Q of the frustum 22 is about 12or. The desired included angle e between the outer legs of the recurved cone section 24 , varies depending upon the material of the rivet 10 , upon the type of upset head to be formed, and upon the material used for the substrate 11 immediately adjacent the upset head.Preferably, the angle e is in a range of 100 to 140 . If the material of the substrate 11 is soft relative to the material of the rivet 10 , or if it is merely desired to prevent damage to the substrate 11 , the upsetting force exerted by the installation tool 10 should be as low as possible. The smaller the included angle between the recurved cone 24 , the lower the force needed to upset the rivet 10 . Conversely, increasing the included angle between the sides of the recurved cone 24 , increases the amount of force needed to upset the cavity end 14 of rivet 10 . The included angle e between the sides of the recurved cone 24 also affects the size of the upset head 13 Fig. 3 which is formed. A larger diameter of upset head can be achieved by using a larger included angle between the sides of the recurved cone 24 . Generally accepted practice in aircraft manufacturing is to have the rivet diameter of the upset 1.5 times the original shank diameter, although an upset diameter of 1.3 times the shank diameter is acceptable. These upset sizes have been found to be sufficient to prevent pull through of the rivet under adverse loading conditions. The material used in rivet 10 also affects the angle between the sides of recurved cone 24 . As a general rule, harder rivet materials cannot be upset or cold worked to the extent that softer materials can.Therefore, a larger angle between the sides of the recurved cone 24 is often used for harder rivet materials. As previously mentioned, the larger the angle between the sides of the recurved cone 24 , the more force is required to set the rivet and form the head. An important feature of this invention is the ability to upset rivet 10 without damaging the adjacent substrate 11 , and with the additional ability of controlling the expansion of shank 15 . When typical rivets are upset, the entire rivet shank is placed into compression with the result that the shank permanently expands, especially near the external surface adjacent the upset heads. The installation tool 18 has the ability to limit the amount of expansion of the shank 15 as well as the ability to minimize damage to the layer of substrate 11 immediately adjacent the upset head 13 . Referring to Figure 5, anvil pin 20 is axially movable against the resistance of spring 28 . Varying the resistance of spring 28 can control the amount of force which is introduced into the bottom 16a of cavity 16 by contact with anvil pin 20 , and thus, introduced into the shank 15 . The more force exerted on shank 15 , the more the shank will expand. There are numerous methods readily available in the art to vary the force exerted on anvil pin 20 . In addition to subsLituting for spring 28 , a spring or springs having different or variable spring constants, the compression of the spring 28 can be varied by rotating the threshold retaining plug 30 to compress or release the initial spring preload. The amount of expansion introduced into shank 15 can thus be controlled by the amount of force exerted by anvil pin 20 . For composite substrates 11 and 12 , it is desirable to have little shank expansion unless there is a clearance fit which is to be partially or entirely eliminated by shank expansion. Thus for composite substrates 11 and 12 , the force exerted on anvil pin 20 will be low, preferably only sufficient to insure proper positioning of anvil pin 20 in the cavity 16 , and whatever additional forces are introduced by any friction or binding from the upsetting portion of cavity end 14 should those collapsing walls contact the anvil pin 20 and impede its travel into the body of upsetting tool 18 .Eliminating the shank expansion and surface deformation adjacent the upset head 13 , can eliminate the curvature or bowing inherent in riveted structures using interference fit rivets, or cavity rivets of previous inventions. If the wall thickness of the annular portion of the cavity end 14 is made too thin, localized buckling occurs which causes small segments of the rivet wall to deflect, with the possibility that if the deflection is inward, the anvil pin 20 may experience binding. Thus, the wall thickness of the cavity end 14 should be sufficiently thick to ensure uniform columnar buckling occurs. The cavity walls 14 must contain a sufficient volume of material to form an acceptable upset head.Figure 8 and Table 1 show dimensions for cavity end 14 of rivet 10 which have been found suitable in practice when made out of either TiCb alloys or K Monel, when used in a standard upset head configuration on graphite epoxy substrates.

An angle of 140 is used for harder materials such as Beta 3 alloy. As previously indicated, 140 angle produces an upset head 1Ob which is slightly larger in diameter and lower in height than does the 100 angle. Figure 6 shows a double flush rivet configuration which provides a relatively smooth aerodynamic surface.The shape of the installation tool 18 used to form this flush configuration of upset head 13 in counter sunk hole 49 is shown in Figure 7. As shown, the included angle f of the frustum 22 is increased to 1400 for the flush mounted head configuration. Additionally, the recurved cone 24 is not required, and has been eliminated. Table 2 shows the dimensions for rivet 10 which have been found preferable for use in the double flush mounting configuration when using K Monel as the rivet material for graphite epoxy substrates.

This alternate embodiment has a shank 15 that is slightly reduced or undercut with respect to the cavity end 54 such that insertion of the rivet 50 through the holes 9 in the substrate ensures there will be a clearance fit between the shank 15 and the adjacent holes in the substrates being joined. This clearance fit is particularly desirable in composites which will tend to delaminate if there is an interference fit between the shank 45 and the adjacent substrates. The amount by which the shank 45 is undercut can be varied, depending upon the amount of shank expansion, if any, occurring during upsetting of the rivet head 13 . The amount of undercut can also accommodate any differences in thermal expansion between the rivet 10 and the adjacent substrates. In yet another embodiment, the shank 15 or 55 of rivets 10 and 50 is work hardened so that the shank expansion is further reduced while facilitating the upsetting of the more maleable cavity ends 14 and 54 . Work hardening the undercut shank 55 as shown inFigure 8 further insures a controlled expansion of shank 55 and provides a sharper demarcation between the shank and the formation of the upset rivet head 13 .
