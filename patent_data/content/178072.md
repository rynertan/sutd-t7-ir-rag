# Variable orbital drive mechanism.

## Abstract
A mechanism for imparting relative orbital motion to at least two associated driven elements 1.1, 1.1A . The driven elements 1.1, 1.1A are driven in an eccentric path, usually with a common drive axis, where the angular displacement of each such path is controlled while relative rotation of the driven elements 1.1, 1.1A is precluded.
