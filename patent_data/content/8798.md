# A cutterhead for a portable power planer.

## Abstract
Cutterhead for a portable power planner including a cylindrical body 11 having a substantially cylindrical surface and defining a rotational axis about which the cylindrical body 11 rotates during normal operation of the power planer. A solid elongated cutting member 14 is provided and has a channel 16 formed therein to define at least two cutting edges 17 . The cylindrical body 11 has an elongated recess 13 formed therein for holding the cutting member 14 . The recess 13 extends in a direction parallel to the rotational axis of the cutterhead and defines a longitudinal aperture a in the surface for accommodating one of the cutting edges 17 . The recess has a recess wall 24 extending inwardly away from the aperture a to surround and hold the cutting member 14 against the centrifugal forces acting thereupon during the rotation of the cylindrical body 11 . Positioning pins 18 arranged in the cylindrical body 11 engage the cutting bar 14 to angularly fix the cutting member 14 so that the one cutting edge penetrates the aperture a at a predetermined angle of elevation with respect to the surface of the cylindrical body 11 . A screw 20 mounted in the cylindrical body 11 directly engages the cutting member 14 to tightly seat the latter against the recess wall 24 .
