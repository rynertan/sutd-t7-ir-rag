# Insertion machine with postage categorization.

## Abstract
In an insertion machine a track 20 moves groups of items past feed stations 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42 during respec tive machine cycles. The feed stations selectively feed items onto the track 20 for inclusion with a group of items and eventual stuffing into an envelope to which postage must be applied. In order for data processing means 102 to calculate the amount of postage necessary, an operator uses a keyboard and display 110 to input predetermined per item weight val ues for items held at select stations. The data processing means 102 uses the predetermined values indicative of the per item weight of items held in the stations to obtain a calculated total weight for each group of items. The items fed at each station and the postal calculation may be controlled by indicia 50 on a master document 46 which are read by photo electric decoder 52, 54.
