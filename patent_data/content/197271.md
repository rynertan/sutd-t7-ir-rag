# Methods for preparing high purity molybdenum or tungsten powder and high purity oxides powder of the same.

## Abstract
There are disclosed a method for preparing a high purity molybdenum or tungsten powder comprising a decompos ing a powder or an oxide powder of molybdenum or tungsten with hydrogen peroxide water b bringing the resulting aqueous solution of molybdenum or tungsten into contact with a cation exchange resin c concentrating the aqueous solution and d reducing a concentrated solid material, and a method for preparing high purity oxides powder thereof comprising a decomposing a powder or an oxide powder of molybdenum or tungsten with hydrogen peroxide water b bringing the resulting aqueous solution of molybdenum or tungsten into contact with a cation exchange resin and c concentrating the aqueous solution. The Mo and W powders and MoO₃ and WO₃ powders prepared by this invention are of an extremely high purity, and it thus is fair to say that they are useful as materials for targets of VLSI elements.
