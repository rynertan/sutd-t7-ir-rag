# Flame spraying device with rocket acceleration.

## Abstract
A flame spraying device including a rocket accelerator 22,30 wherein a low velocity flame 12 is produced into which a coating material is introduced. At least one rocket accelerator 20,30 producing a high velocity stream of combustion product gases is positioned relative to the low velocity flame 12 so that the coating material carried thereby is accelerated toward the substrate to be coated. By positioning the rocket relative to the low velocity flame, the dwell time in the low velocity flame can be optimized to produce the best coating of a substrate. The coating quality is also enhanced by the fact that the coating material does not oxidize or cool significantly while in the high velocity stream and by the fact that the coating material strikes the substrate at high speed thereby resulting in high density coating.
