# ENZYMATIC SYNTHESIS OF S ADENOSYLMETHIONINE

## Abstract
The present invention provides an improved process for enzymatically preparing purified S adenosylmethionine em ploying substantially purified methionine adenosyltrans ferase as the enzyme catalyst. The S adenosylmethionine thus prepared is ideally suited for use in radioenzymatic as says.
