# Margarine fat blend.

## Abstract
A margarine fat blend having a good melting behaviour under temperature conditions prevailing in the mouth is produced according to a process involving i random interesterification of a mixture of hydrogenated and non hydrogenated oils, ii fractionating the interesterified mix ture to obtain a specific olein fraction, and iii mixing appropriate proportions of the olein with liquid oil. The stearin fraction can be recirculated in the system by substituting it for at least part of the hydrogenated oil in the mixture to be interesterified.
