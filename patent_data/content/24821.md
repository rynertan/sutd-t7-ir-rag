# Machine tool and robot control apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus has a numerical control device NC and a robot control device RC which devices are connected by a data line DTL through which data can be exchanged bet ween the devices. The numerical control device NC has a non volatile memory device DMN in which both machining data for numerical control of a machine tool and robot command data for control of a robot are held. The robot control device RC has a small working memory WMR to which robot command data is transferred from non volatile memory device DMN via line DTL . Thus, non volatile memory need be provided only in the numerical control device NC .
