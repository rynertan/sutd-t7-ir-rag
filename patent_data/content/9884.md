# Process for preparing a flexible coated heat sealable packaging film.

## Abstract
Biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile film is treated with corona discharge and coated on one or both sides with olefin polymer or copolymer by extrusion coating. The resultant coated film has excellent flexibility as measured by the Gelbo flex test. This film is readily heat sealed and is useful in pack aging application.

## Description
This invention relates to flexible polyacrylonitrile film coated on one or both sides with olefin polymer or co polymer. The present invention provides a corona discharge treated biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile film extrusion coated on at least one side with an olefin polymer. The present invention further provides a process for preparing a flexible coated film which comprises subjecting a biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile film to corona discharge treatment on each side of the film to be coated and thereafter extrusion coating at least one side of the film with an olefin polymer. In U.S. Patent Ilo. 3,823,061, there is described a process for laminating at least two dissimilar films, such as polyacrylonitrile and polyolefin, wherein both films are treated with corona discharge and then passed together. This disclosure does not teach the present invention, in which only the polyacrylonitrile film is treated with corona discharge and then the other film is formed thereon by extrusion coating. The biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile film utilizable herein can be prepared by casting a film from a solution of polyacrylonitrile and biaxially stretching it, using known techniques. One procedure is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,437,717, to which reference is made. A particularly preferred technique is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,066,731, incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, this technique involves pouring a hot, concentrated solution of polyacrylonitrile in a solvent that is water soluble, e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide, onto a film supporting surface and stripping the resulting film from said surface. The resulting film containing solvent is subjected to contact with water, preferably under constrained conditions, thereby removing the solvent from the film and replacing it with water. The film composed essentially of acrylonitrile and water is then stretched to about 1.5 to about 4 times its original dimension in both the machine direction and the transverse direction. A suitable method is by use of the drafter tenter frame arrangement see U.S.Patent o. 3,437,717 . ZJhile still under restrained conditions, the film is dried, thus producing biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile contemplated for use in this invention. Such film is available commercially. Preferably, the biaxially oriented film is prepared from polyacrylonitrile homopolymer. It is contemplated however, to use films made from co polymers of acrylonitrile with other ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as alkyl acrylates. Film thickness can be between about 1 4 mil and about 4 mils. As indicated hereinbefore, the biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile film is extrusion coated on one or both sides with an olefin polymer or co polymer, such as low density polyethylene LDPE . The preferredLDPE ranges in density from about 0.915 to 0.935 and has a melt index M.I. between about lg 10 min. and about 15g min. Although LDPE is preferred, other thermoplastic olefin polymers and co polymers can be used. Such polymers and co polymers include polypropylene, polybutene, ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene alkyl meth acrylate co polymer such as ethylene ethyl acrylate, and ionomers Surlyn A . For the sake of brevity in this description, the olefinic polymers or co polymers will be referred to as olefin polymer . Prior to extrusion coating the biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile film with LDPE, the base film surface is subjected to corona discharge treatment on each side to be coated. A feasible extrusion coating operation involves in line corona discharge treating one surface of a biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile base film prior to extrusion coating and subsequently laying down on the base film a film of olefin polymer from an extruder fitted with a suitable slot die. The coated assembly is then cooled2 as by passing it between cooled nip rolls. Then, when both side coating is desired, the one side coated film is turned over and the process is repeated by passing it through the aforedescribed operation to coat the other side of the base film withLDPE. An alternative operation involves in line tandem extrusion coating both sides in a single pass. In general, the melt temperature of the extruded LDPE will be about 300 6500F. Typical melt temperatures for other olefin polymers are EVA, 250 4300F. EEAm 2500 6000F. and ionomers, 300 5500F. The thickness of the olefin polymer film or coating can be between about 0.25 mil and about 2.0 mils and preferably about 0.5 1 mil. Example 1 Biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile base film was passed horizontally through an LDPE extrusion coating line at a speed of 300 feet per minute About 4 feet prior to the point where the LDPE coating was applied, the film surface was treated with corona discharge. The level of corona discharge treatment was 350 watts spread out over 32 inches at the line speed of 300 feet per minute. After corona discharge treatment,LDPE was applied to one side of the base film from an extruder equipped with a slot die and the resultant assembly was cooled. Then, the one side coated base film was turned over and coated on the other side withLDPE, as aforedescribed. Throughout the runs, the melt temperature of the LDPE was 5800F. In one run the LDPE coating on each side was 0.5 mil and in another it was 1 mil. The LDPE had a density of 0.917 and an M.I. of 6.5. GELBO FLEX TESTER This instrument is used to simulate the flexing conditions imposed on water vapor barrier materials used in packaging and conforming toSpecification MIL B 131 D ASTM F392 74 . The instrument consists of a 3 1 2 diameter stationary head and a 3 1 2 diameter movable head spaced at a distance of 7 face to face. Shoulders 1 2 wide on each head are used to support the test specimen.The motion of the movable head is controlled by a grooved, motor device, reciprocating shaft with a stroke of 6 and a twisting motion of 4000 in the first 3 1 2 of travel followed by a horizontal motion of 2 1 2 . The flexing speed is 40 cycles per minute, a full cycle consisting of one forward and one return stroke. The films of Example 1 were tested on theGelbo Flex Tester and in other ASTM film tests. The results and tests used are set forth in Table I. TheControl was uncoated biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile base film.
