# Improvements in or relating to Stubless Multi ply assemblies.

## Abstract
A unit set assembly of multiple plies includes superimposed top 11 , intermediate 12 and bottom 13 plies each being devoid of any tear lines which may form a stub, and each being coated on selected surfaces thereof with chemicals which are capable of reacting with one another to produce a coloured mark. The top 11 and bottom 13 plies are interconnected by means of a removable glue flap 14 , and portions of the glue extend through holes 17 lying along a margin of the bottom ply 13 so as to thereby interconnect the intermediate 12 and bottom 13 plies together. The top ply is coated front and back and the intermediate ply is coated on its back surface with a micro encapsulated colour precursor, while the bottom ply is coated front and back and the top surface of the intermediate ply is coated with a record developing material. Upon application of pressure to the set, coloured marks are formed on the intermediate and bottom ply top surface as the reactive components of the coatings on mating surfaces react. The plies are capable of re arrangement such that by removal of the intermediate ply and by placing the backs of the top and bottom plies in mating engagement coloured marks are produced on the backs of the plies as the reactive components of the coating of these mating surfaces are forced into reactive contact upon the application of pressure to the back of the set. The unit set may also include at least two of such intermediate plies, similarly coated as the intermediate ply of the three ply set so that, upon application of pressure to the set, coloured marks are formed on both intermediate and bottom ply top surfaces as the reactive components of the coatings on mating surfaces react. Portions of the glue extend through aligned holes lying along the margins of the lower intermediate and bottom plies, the latter being smaller than the former so as to mask portion of the glue extending therethrough. The plies are capable of re arrangement as in the three ply set upon removal of both intermediate plies.
