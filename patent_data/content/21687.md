# Method of reconditioning a worn chain link.

## Abstract
A reconditioned worn chain link 11 with a body and opposed ends has a slightly increased cross section 24 at its mid portion which has less tensile strength than a new original link as a result of heat treatment but less overall length while maintaining identical pitch. The method for reconditioning includes the steps of applying intense concentrated heat to the mid portion of a worn link 11 to permit reforming and using compression means 15,16 to compress at least one end toward the other to shorten said link 11 slightly a predetermined distance to restore its original pitch.
