## Description
This invention relates to a method of making a laminated body which consists of an upper layer member and a synthetic resin layer and to a molding apparatus for use in the same. As one method of making a laminated body, there is proposed, for example, in the Japanese Patent Application Disclosure No.150740 of 1984 a method whereby the molding of the laminated body is performed by the use of a molding apparatus which is provided with a movable female mold or a movable male mold and with an upper layer member fixing frame having a sliding port wherethrough the male mold passes slidingly, and wherein, after holding an upper member between the upper layer member fixing frame and the female mold, a molten resin is supplied between the upper layer member and the female mold or the male mold and then the mold tightening of the female mold and the male mold is conducted. When using this former method as mentioned above, it is however impossible to make such a laminated body possessing a good appearance, clear of wrinkles or tears over the upper layer member covering the synthetic resin. Further, it needs a cutting process and a cutting apparatus for cutting the upper layer member after the forming process. Furthermore, it is difficult to be in accordance with the each center point of the upper layer member and the synthetic resinous body by the former apparatus not combining the the molding apparatus and cutting apparatus. Synthetic resinous moldings are being used nowadays in large quantities in every field including, for example, motorcars, home electric appliances, and others for reasons of the inexpensiveness, the easy shapability as desired, and the lightweight properties. On the other hand, however, these known molded goods have certain defects in that they are cheap looking, cold to the touch or easily scratched. It is strongly desired to impart to them a degree of decorativeness or a sense of being soft to the touch. For such reasons, although a variety of investigations and researches have been done in the past with the object of manufacturing compound articles able to satisfy such demands as mentioned above, yet it has proved that it is difficult for products made of a single substance to possess the necessary free shapeability, the desired strength and the surface property being improved in relation to the above mentioned defects. Therefore, in the current state of technology, there are widely use in general such kinds of laminated bodies as are assembled with plural materials which have a variety of functions. In this specification, the mold whose outer side face corresponds to the side face of the outermost circumference being opposite to each other at the mold tightening time is called a male mold, while the mold whose inner side face corresponds to the same as above mentioned side face of the outermost circumference being opposite to each other at the same mold tightening time is called a female mold. The method and the apparatus according to our invention both have been accomplished by aiming to solve the above mentioned problem in the former method and thereby enables the laminated body being covered by the upper layer member to be obtained without wrinkles, tears, and with each centre point of the upper layer member and the synthetic resinous body being aligned. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of making a laminated body consisting of a synthetic resin provided with an upper layer member thereon, comprising the steps of arranging said upper layer member between a female mold and an upper layer member fixing frame attached shiftably either on the side of a female mold or on the side of a male mold, supplying molten resin between said male mold and female mold, closing said female mold and said upper layer member fixing frame so that periphery of said upper layer member is held by contact of said female mold and said upper layer member fixing frame, further closing said female mold and said male mold so as to start to shape at least said upper layer member and compressing said female mold and said male mold so as to shape said upper layer member and said molten resin by this compression, characterized by cutting, prior to or simultaneous with completion of said compressing step said upper layer member by engagement of the inner edges of said female mold with outer edges of said male mold while said molten resin is shaped between said molds without being cut by said edges, so as to form the laminated body. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a molding apparatus for making a laminated body consisting of a synthetic resin member having an upper layer member thereon, which apparatus comprises a male mold, a female mold, an upper layer member fixing frame, an expanding and contracting means, the upper layer member fixing frame being mounted either on the side of the male mold or on the side of the female mold for shifting by means of the expanding and contracting means and the outer side face of the male mold being slidable over the whole circumference of an opening through which the convex parts of the male mold are insertable, characterised in that both the outer side edge of the male mold and the inner side edge of the female mold constitute a cutter for the upper layer member and the outer side of the male mold and the inner side of the female mold being dimensional to slide on each other over the whole circumference, so that said synthetic resin member can be molded between said molds without being cut by said cutter to form said laminated body. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Now we describe in details for a first exemplary embodiment of the method and apparatus according to the present invention with reference to illustrating of Figs. 1 to 8. Fig. 1 and Figs. 3 to 8 are sectional views for illustrating the exemplary embodiment Fig. 2 is a view seen in the direction of the arrowheads of the lines A A of Fig. 1 In the figures, the reference numeral The molding apparatus The upper layer member fixing frame 4 which has the upper face being opposite to the female mold 3 is mounted shiftably by a plurality of the expanding and contracting means 5, and possesses the sliding opening 6. It is permissible for use in the expanding and contracting means 5 to adopt freely any known oil pressure cylinder, air pressure cylinder, air pressure spring, elastomeric spring, steel spring, and such like depending on the required stroke. In this connection, there can be adopted preferably a spring mechanism capable of expanding and contracting in response to the mold tightening force of both the molds, male 2 and female 3. The convex parts 7 of the male mold 2 inserts into the sliding opening 6 which is shiftably slided by the outer side face 8 of the male mold 2 on the whole circumference. The male mold 2 and the female mold 3 both slide on the outer side face 8 and the inner side face 9 of the whole circumference each other. The cutting edges to cut the upper layer member 10 off consist of the edge 8a of the outer side face 8 of the male mold 2 and the edge 9a of the outer side face 9 of the female mold 3. In the case of the upper layer member 10 made of the soft material such as a paper or a cloth, the edge 8a of the outer side face 8 of the male mold 2 and the edge 9a of the outer side face 9 of the female mold 3 need to be made from different materials having disparate degrees of hardness. It is preferably to select from S45C J.I.S.name of steel or S45C J.I.S.name of steel for the actuation side the side of the female mold 3 in this example and from SKS J.I.S.name of steel or SKD11 J.I.S.name of steel for the fixed side. The clearance between the edge 8a of the outer side face 8 of the male mold 2 and the edge 9a of the outer side face 9 of the female mold 3 is a small distance such as from 0.01mm to 0,2mm for cutting the upper layer member 10. A small change of the above clearance value is permitted owing to the each variety and thickness of the the upper layer member 10. Using the molding apparatus 1 relating to the exemplary embodiment which has such a construction as mentioned above, the method 1 according to our invention is effected for example, in the sequence of processes from 1 to 6 described below In this method according to our invention, a point of time when the molten resin 11 is supplied is not restricted only to the above described time. It does not matter if the supply of the molten resin 11 is conducted either when both the male mold 2 and the female mold 3 are made to further approach as far as the position where the upper layer member 10 is squeezed into the intermediary stage after the periphery 12 of the upper layer member 10 has been held, or the upper layer member 10 has been cut. Futhermore, the supply of the molten resin 11 may be conducted before placing the upper layer member 10 on the upper layer member fixing frame 4 before holding the the upper layer member 10 in the state of Fig. 1. In the method according to our invention, the form and appearance of laminated body 14 is influenced whether the timing of the cutting step of the upper layer member 10 is in accordance with the timing of the mold tightening step or not. Hereinafter, the case 1 to case 3 of the above influenced embodiments are described. In the case that the timing of the cutting step of the upper layer member 10 is earlier than the timing of the mold tightening step, a laminated body 14 in which the synthetic resin body 13 is overflowed out of the end of the upper layer member 10 like Fig.6 is obtained. In the case that the timing of the cutting step of the upper layer member 10 is earlier than the timing of the mold tightening step but the both timings are in nearly accordance, a laminated body 14 in which the sythetic resin body 13 is nearly perfectly wrapped by the upper layer member 10 like Fig.7 is obtained. In the case that the timing of the cutting step of the upper layer member 10 is in approximate accordance with the timing of the mold tightening step, a laminated body 14 in which the synthetic resin body 13 is perfectly wrapped by the upper layer member 10 like Fig.8 is obtained. In the case 3, the upper layer member 10 may be imperfect cut as possible as cutting by hand pulling after molding. In the method and apparatus according to our invention, it is sufficient if the molten resin 11 is supplied between the upper layer member 10 and the male mold 2 through at least any one of the molten synthetic resin passages being provided at the inside of the male mold 2 or at the outside of the molding apparatus In the method and apparatus according to our invention, the periphery 12 of the upper layer member 10 sometimes shifts gradually toward the inside of the female mold 3 with the progress of the molding, so that it is especially important to set the fixing force against the upper layer member 10, because the upper layer member 10 is liable to deform itself nearly along the form of the female mold 3 as the latter goes down. Such being the case, when the fixing force working is too small, then the upper layer member 10 undergoes a big glide produced between the upper layer member 4 and the female mold 3, and thereby the upper layer member 10 broader than the area required for the laminated body 14 comes to be supplied into the female mold 3, which brings wrinkles to the laminated body 14, while on the other hand when the fixing force is too big, then the upper layer member 10 becomes unable to bear the tensile force created, thereby ending in the breakage. In the method apparatus according to our invention, in case, for example the form of the laminated body 14 is simple, only the mutually opposite two edges of the upper layer member 10 need be held. On the other hand, in case for example the form of the laminated body 14 is complex, all the edges of the upper layer member 10 must be held by optimum fixing force for obtaining the laminated body 14 without wrinkles and breakage on the upper layer member 10. In our invention, in case, for example the form of the laminated body 14 is simple and some fiber powerful in stretchiness is used for the upper layer member 10 there is often among various kinds of fibers such a one as having the strechiness of 400 , it is not always necessary that upper layer member 10 ought to have the gliding behavior as described in the exemplary embodiment. In order to set the above mentioned fixing force at the time of effectuating the method described herein, it is necessary to select the optimum value being based on the properties of the materials that is, the stretchiness or the squeezing rate of the upper layer member 10, the curvature of every vertex and edges of the molded goods and others. However, the one generally used is of 5 300 kg cm to the sectional area of the fixing part. In setting the required area of the upper layer member 10, it is necessary to design the upper layer member 10 so as to check the occurrence of trimming losses as possible first on the basis of the developing area of the laminated body 14 and next by reducing the size of the upper layer member 10 while taking the stretchiness thereof into consideration. For the upper layer member 10 being used in the method according to the invention, there can be named the following substances woven stuff, unwoven stuff, metal, fiber, thermoplastic resinous net, paper, metal foil, and sheet or film made of thermoplastic resin and thermoplastic elastomer, but things decorated with concavoconvex patterns of tie dyed fabrics, by printing or dyeing,or foaming bodies may he used and further it is also possible to use the above mentioned substances in the form of a laminated article which is made by laminating a single or two or more sorts of them using some adhesive agents and the like. In using such an upper layer member 10, it is also possible pre heat it in order to regulate the stress or the stretchiness the upper layer member 10 before supplying it. For the synthetic resin 13 used in the method according to the invention, it is possible to use any such substances as are ordinarily used in compression molding, injection molding, and extrusion molding, for example, nonfoaming or foaming resins made of thermoplastic elastomers such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, acrylonitrile styrene butadien block copolymer, thermoplastic resin like nylon, ethylene propylene block copolymer, styrene butadiene, block copolymer, and such like, and further the materials above mentioned being made to contain fillers, for example, inorganic filler, glass fiber etc., etc, and such additives as pigment, talc, antistatic agent, and others. Figs. 9 to 11 are sectional Views explaining the modified embodiment 1 of the method and apparatus according to the invention, wherein the male mold 2 has a notch 8b continuing the whole circumference in the vicinity of the outer side face edge 8a thereof. The length L of the notch 8b is decided on the basic of the form of the laminated body 14 and the material of the upper layer member 10 not restricted in the same length as the length of each side of the outer side face 8 edge 8a of the male mold 2 through the whole circumference. And the width W of the notch 8b is planned on the basis the size of the most extended measure in the plane direction and the most compressioned measure in the thickness direction of the upper layer member 10 during the whole molding process. The clearance between the edge 8a of the outer side surface 8 of the male mold 2 and the edge 9a of the female mold 3 is commonly planed in small distance such as as from 0.01mm to 0.2mm for cutting the upper layer member 10 but a small change from the above clearance value is permitted owing to the each variety and the each thickness of the upper layer member 10. When the method by using of the molding apparatus In this laminated body 14, the end of the upper layer 10 is expanded out of the outside face of the resin body 13 like Fig.10 and Fig.11. Therefore, the expanded end of the upper layer 10 is bent into the inner direction of the resin body 13, resulting in the laminated body 14 of Fig.11 being obtained. In the modified embodiment 2 to 4 hereinafter described, although the relative position between their male molds 2 and their female molds 3 and the upper layer members fixing frame 4 are subject to change, they have basically the same construction as effect as mentioned in the exemplary embodiment. Figs.12 to 15 are sectional views explaining the modified embodiment 2 of the method and apparatus according to the invention, wherein the upper layer member fixing frame 4 is provided shiftably at the male mold 2 which is here situated above, while on the other hand the female mold 3 is situated below. The method according to the invention is effected by the molding apparatus Figs. 16 to 18 are sectional views explaining the modified embodiment 3 of the method and apparatus according to the invention, wherein the upper layer member fixing frame 4 is provided shiftably at the male mold 2 which is here situated below, while on the other hand the female mold 3 is situated above. The method according to the invention is effect by the molding apparatus The upper layer member 10 being placed on the female mold 3 like Fig. 12, next, after holding the periphery 12 of the upper layer member 10 between the upper layer member fixing frame 4 and the female mold 3, molten resin 11 being supplied, the upper layer member 10 and the molten resin 11 unite in a body to be given form and to be cut by the mold tightenings, and graduate into the completion of the molding as in the exemplary embodiment See Fig. 18 . Figs.19 is a sectional view explaining the modified embodiment 4 of the method and apparatus according to the invention, wherein the upper layer member fixing frame 4 is provided shiftably at the female mold 3 which is here situated above. The method according to the invention is effected by the molding apparatus The upper layer member 10 being placed on the upper layer member fixing frame 4 like Fig.19,next, molten resin 11 being supplied through molten resin passage not shown provided in the female mold 3, after holding the periphery 12 of the upper layer member 10 between the upper layer member fixing frame 4 and the female mold 3, the upper layer member 13 and the molten resin 11 unite in a body to be given form and to be cut by the mold tightening, and graduate into the completion of the molding. In the method and apparatus according to the invention, the separating direction namely here means the mold tightening direction is not always only the hereinbefore deseribed vertical direction, but it does not matter if it is the horizontal directions, for example. In this latter case, lest the molten resin 11 should flow out of the molding apparatus As explained in detail in the above, the method according to the invention is designed in such a manner that it comprises the steps of arranging the upper layer member between an upper layer member fixing frame which is attached shiftably either on the side of a male mold or on the side of a female mold of a molding apparatus provided with the male mold and the female mold both sliding on the each face of the whole circumference and which has a sliding opening where the outer side face of the male mold slides over the whole circumference and the convex parts of the male mold inserts through, and the female mold With such a construction, the method according to the invention has various effect that it not only requires any additives but also is adapted excellently to the mass production in simple working processes, and that it able to make the laminated body being in possession of a good appearance without wrinkles or tears on the upper layer member and being short of wrinkes on the bended parts of the upper layer member, as a result of which there can be obtained the laminated body which is low in residual stress owing to the orientation because of the molding of its synthetic resin here not being dependent on the injection molding method and further which has only a small deformation like distortion as well. On the other hand, the molding apparatus according to the invention is designed in such a manner that it comprises at the very least a male mold, a female mold, an upper layer member fixing frame, an expanding and contracting means, and which is characterized in that the upper layer member fixing frame is mounted either on the side of the male mold or on the side of the female mold shiftably by means of the expanding and contracting means and has a sliding opening where the outer side face of the male mold slides over the whole circumference and the convex parts of the male mold inserts through Further, the preferable feeling of the laminated body produced in accordance with the method of the invention can be kept long because of the effective pressure required for molding the synthetic resin being small, for example, now by being capable of preventing the foaming layer from crushing in case of using some foaming sheet for the upper layer member now by being capable of preventing the napped part from falling in case of using the cloth treated by nap raising.
