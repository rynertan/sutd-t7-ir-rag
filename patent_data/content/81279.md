## Description
AN IMPROVED PLASTIC FOOD CONTAINER OF DOUBLE WALL CONSTRUCTION Background of the Invention This invention relates generally to molded plastic food containers such as plates, bowls, cups and the like. Holding Molding plastic materials to form plates, bowls, cups and similar articles for holding goods or liquids is, of course, well known. It is equally well known to mold similar materials for such purposes to be relatively thick to provide strength to permit them to be self supporting even when holding a material of some weight and in many instances to provide thermal insulation. Thus, it is known to mold such articles as solid devices or to mold them in separate pieces which are joined to form a hollow structure and may or may not be filled with an insulating material. Heretofore, to applicant s knowledge, plastic food containers having some degree of physical strength have been formed using injection or vacuum molding techniques in order to obtain the thickness necessary to provide the desired strength. For instance, where a reusable cup, dish or the like is desired, advantageous qualities include sufficient strength rigidity to be self supporting and to support the weight of the food or drink placed on or in the article. Very frequently, these objectives are achieved by molding a relatively thick structure but, as is obvious, this requires use of larger amounts of material which makes such articles costly to manufacture. Strength, as well as thermal insulation, is sometimes provided by forming a hollow structure and foaming an insulating material therein.The hollow foam filled structures, to applicant s knowledge, are formed by vacuum molding or injection molding two separate pieces and joining them along their mating edges. It is an object of this invention to provide a novel plastic article of double wall construction formed as a unitary structure having sufficient physical strength to be self supporting and filled with an insulating material. A further object of this invention is to provide a novel unitary plastic structure using smaller amounts of material yet having the strength of conventional structures having similar dimensions which utilize larger amounts of material. Brief Description of the Invention The foregoing and other objects of the invention are achieved by providing a unitary plastic structure having double wall construction with integral posts or braces extending between the two walls to maintain a desired distance between the walls. This space between the walls is filled with a material for the.purpose of providing thermal insulation and strength. Brief Description of the Drawings The invention itself is set forth in the claims appended hereto and forming a part of this specification while an understanding of the embodiment thereof may be had by reference to the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of an article such as a dish or bowl formed in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a side view of the article ofFigure 1 Figure 3 i8 a top view of the article ofFigure 1 Figure 4 is a cross sectional view taken along the lines 4 4 of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a partial bottom view of the article of Figure 1 Figure 6 is a perspective vie of another embodiment of the present invention wherein an article is formed, such as a plate and Figure 7 is a perspective view of still another embodiment of the invention where the article is formed, such as a cup. Detailed Description A molded plastic food or beverage container in accordance with this invention can be formed in a wide variety of shapes and sizes depending upon the needs of a potential user and the choices of the designer. The particular embodiments of the present invention described and illustrated herein are exemplary of some of these various shapes. In Figures 1 6, a molded plastic dish or bowl 10 of the double walled construction type includes an inside wall 12 and an outside wall 14 which are joined to form a lip 16 about the periphery of the bowl to provide an enclosed space 18. Because of the foam insulation 19 in the dead air space provided by the double wall construction an article according to the invention such as bowl 10 has advantageous thermal insulating properties. A base 20 formed from wall 14 enables the bowl to maintain a stable position when seated upon a planar surface 21. The base includes an annular recess 22 which defines a central island section 24.At least one, and preferably a plurality, of reinforcing posts 26 are integrally formed from the central island portion of wall 14. Although these posts can be formed in a variety of tubular configurations, the posts preferably have a frusto conical shape and are defined by a continuous tubular wall 28 and an end 30 which is contiguous to wall 12 and terminates between this wall s inner surface 12a and outer surface 12b.As seen in Figure 4 the contour of outer surface 12b adjacent end 30 is not altered, i.e., it is smooth and continuous. It is desirable to have a smooth food receiving surface to prevent food from being trapped. It is an important concept of the present invention that these posts be formed from the walls of the container during the molding of the latter.The container and posts are simultaneously molded from a single length of tubular plastic so that the end 30 of the post is integrally molded with the opposing wall 12. This not only joins the end 30 to wall 12 but also seals the outer portion of tubular wall 28 adjacent end 30 to the inner surface 12a thereby providing a secure connection with wall 12.The posts thus form spaced tubular reinforcing stakes or braces between the two walls without allowing access to the enclosed space in the compartment. Such a container can be formed by extruding a length of tubular plastic as is known in the art and captivating same between a pair of molds, commonly called blow molding. A first mold forms wall 12from approximately one half of the tubular plastic while a second mold simultaneously forms wall 14 from the other half of the tubular plastic. At least one of the molds will contain an orifice which is used to inject pressurized air into the space 18 via aperture 25 in wall 14 to prevent the two walls from collapsing or coming in contact before the plastic has sufficiently hardened. The posts 26 are formed during the molding process by disposing frusto conical shaped pins on the second mold extending generally perpendicular to the wall 12 which is being formed. As the first and second mold converge, the tubular length of plastic is forced to conform to the surface contours of the molds and thus the posts are formed simultaneously with the formation of wall 14. The pins, which form the posts, are dimensioned such that ends 30 of the posts project slightly into wall 12 to form an integral joint with that wall once the molten plastic solidifies. When the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the molds are separated and the container is removed.Insulation 19 is injected via aperture 25 into compartment 18 to substantially fill same. Such insulation is injected in a liquid or foam state which then solidifies. The posts allow a container of double wall construction to be formed to have sufficient strength to be self supporting while allowing smaller quantities of plastic material to be utilized than for conventional structures of similar dimensions. The two walls are maintained at a constant spacing, thus resisting to a great degree a force exerted perpendicular to one of the walls tending to deform them. Another advantage provided by the posts, especially when three or more posts are provided in a geometric relationship such as shown in Figure 3, is that these posts reinforce the planar relationship of wall 12 relative to wall 14 to resist lateral movement. Thus, it will be apparent that the posts provide generally increased rigidity and stability for the container.Although container 10 is illustrated as utilizing three posts in the base, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that different numbers of posts could be employed in the base as well as at other locations throughout the container. It is also desirable that container 10 have substantial thermal insulating properties so as to maintain the food placed therein at a palatable temperature for substantial periods of time. The outer lip 22a of the annular recess 22 is dimensioned to provide a collar upon which wall 14 rests. Thus, the central island portion 24 which includes posts 26 is sealed between the collar and the planar surface 21 upon which the latter rests. This prevents any airflow past the posts thereby reducing heat losses due to convection currents. Heat losses by conduction are minimized by the hollow, as opposed to solid, construction of the posts and by recessing the island section 24 so that it does not contact the supporting surface 21. Figure 6 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention in which a plate 50 of the doublewall construction type has been formed. Insulation may be disposed between the two walls to provide for reduced heat losses similar to that described with respect to bowl 10 in Figure 4. ccse of the generally planar dimension of plate 50, a plurality of dispersed posts connecting the two walls may be advantageously employed to provide greater strength over the entire planar extent of the plate. Figure 7 illustrates still another embodiment of the present invention comprising a cup 60 of double wall construction. The base 62 of the cup includes reinforcing posts which connect the inner and outer walls at the bottom of the cup to provide increased rigidity and strength. The cup may be provided with an insulation material similar to that described with respect to Figure 4 to further reduce heat losses. The present invention as exemplified by the preceding embodiments provides an integral plastic container of double wall construction which has sufficient physical strength to be self supporting and increased rigidity when compared with conventional structures having similar dimensions. The reinforcing posts are economically formed as an integral part of one of the walls of the container, thereby providing a single step. The foam insulation filling the container provides improved insulating properties and contributes to the strength of the container.
