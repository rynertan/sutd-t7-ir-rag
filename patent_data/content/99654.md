# Sequencing means for Stirling cycle, Ericsson cycle or the like apparatus.

## Abstract
In Stirling Cycle or similar apparatus having a compress or 15, 15a , a cold finger 1 and a displacer 4 within the cold finger, sequencing between the compressor and the displacer is effected by a piston 7 effecting displacement of the displacer in response to pressure variations in the compressor 15, 15a and a combination of piston valves 9, 10 and one way valves 12, 14 preventing flow between the compressor 15a and the cold finger 1 until desired displacements of the displacer 4 have been effected.
