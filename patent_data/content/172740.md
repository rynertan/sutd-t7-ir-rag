# Control system for an infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
A system for controlling an infinitely variable belt drive transmission for an engine is described. A primary pulley 36 of the transmission has a hydraulically shiftable disc 36b , a secondary pulley 37 has a hydraulically shiftable disc 37b , a belt 34 engages with both pulleys 36, 37 . A hydraulic control circuit, includes a transmission ratio con trol valve 70 having a spool 72 shiftable in response to engine speed for controlling the oil pressure for shifting the disc 36b of the primary pulley 36 to change the transmis sion ratio. Pitot pressure dependent on the engine speed is applied to the spool 72 to shift the spool against a spring 74 the force of which is decided by the depression of an accelerator pedal 80a . A correcting device 65, 114 is provided to increase the load on the spring dependent on upshifting operation of the transmission, so that speed of a vehicle increases in proportion to increase of engine speed.
