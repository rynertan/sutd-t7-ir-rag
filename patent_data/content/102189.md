# Reflectometer.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a reflectometer 30 30a for the analysis of a generally flat test element E comprising a one piece molded housing 32 32a of light transmissive material a source 34 34a and a detector means 36 36a are contained within the housing 32 32a . In order to ensure that only diffuse radiation is received by the detector means 36 36a , radiation from the source 34 34a is at least partially collimated, a shield means 62 62a is provided around detector means 36 36a , and means are provided to exclude specular reflection from the detector means 36 36a .
