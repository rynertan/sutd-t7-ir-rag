## Description
IMPROVED LIGHT WEIGHT PLASTIC VEHICULS INTERIOR BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention generally relates to building constructions and more particularly to a novel, low weight plastic building construction particularly adapted for use in aircraft and other vehicles. BACKGROUND OF THE PRIOR ART Vehicular interior building structures particularly those used in large aircraft, have traditionally been constructed of heavy duty, durable metals, such as steel, reinforced aluminum and the like, alone or in combination with relatively heavy plastics such as fiberglass and the like. For example, airline galleys for the past 25 years have been constructed primarily of high tensile strength aluminum alloys coupled with stainless steel and relatively rigid heavy plastics. Due to the tremendous recent increase in the cost of vehicular fuel, such as jet fuel, the weight of all vehicular components is being carefully scrutinized. Airlines are losing money and certain flights are being curtailed.Weight reductions of interior aircraft constructions and the like must now be made in order to reduce the consumption of jet fuel sufficiently and or allow a sufficient increase in passenger and cargo loading to make commercial flights profitable once more. Basically the same problem faces the passenger car, bus and truck industry. The cost of fuel has necessitated 9 drastic reduction in vehicular body shell weight.Further reductions are needed and must come in part from the use of lighter, stronger interior constructions which are thermally and acoustically insulative and are flame retardant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved form of inexpensive vehicular interior building construction which has superior strength, adaptability, flame resistance, thermal and acoustical properties ad which is substantially lighter in weight than conventional constructions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The improved light weight, all plastic vehicular interior building construction of the present invention satisfies all the foregoing needs. The construction is particularly well adapted for use in commercial airline galleys but is also useful in other airplane interior components such as airplane interior room partitions, and dividers, for example, clockrooms, storage compartments, etc. Furthermore, it is useful in truck, bus and passenger car interior panels, such as dashboards, seat benches, luggage compartment dividers, etc. The construction of the present invention has been shown to reduce the weight in.airiiner galleys as much as 40 and thus reduce airfuel consumption and permit higher passenger and cargo loading for improved economy. The panels of the construction each comprise a sandwich containing a sheet of rigid core material comprising expanded closed cellular plastic. The core is light in weight, flame resistant and thermally and acoustically insulative. The sides of the core in the sandwich are abutted by light weight, high tensile strength sheets of aromid type fibrous plastic which is also flame resistant. The panels are joined together by plastic adhesive, end caps to pins, flexible flame resistant plastic cloth bonded in place, and other similar means to provide the desired rigid light weight unitary construction.Other features of the invention are set forth in the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGURE 1 Now referring more particularly to FIGURE 1 of the accompanying drawings, a preferred embodiment of an improved light weight vehicular interior building construction in accordance with the present invention is schematically depicted therein. Thus,an airline galley unit 20 is shown which includes interconnected components comprising a horizontal base 22, upstanding sidewalls 24 and 26, a horizontal top 28, a vertical back 30, and a specially configured generally vertical front 32, defining therebetween an enclosed central interior space 34. As can be seen from FIGURE 1, wall 26 is curved to conform to aircraft interior bulkhead design and or appearance requirements. Moreover, galley unit 20 includes a plurality of internal panels not shown which divide up space 34 to form a number of compartments, for example top compartment 36 and bottom compartment 38, both of which are open at front 32 and are adapted to receive, for example, respectively, a heating range and an aisle serving cart not shown .Unit 20 can also include, for example, front opening compartments 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50 and 52, most of which include front door or drawer coverings. A horizontal counter or shelf 54 is also provided inUnit 20, as well as a cart retaining bar 56 or the like horizontal brace means, as shown in FIGURE 1, and an aisle side compartment access door 58. FIGURES 2 10 a The components of galley unit 20 are formed of interconnected panels 60. Each panel 60 comprises a core 62 in the form of a flat sheet of closed cellular expanded plastic, such as thatsold under the trademark Klegescell. Such sheet may be for example, about .625 to .875 inch thick, with a density of about 4.5 pounds per cubic foot. Other densities are also useful. Klegecell is the trademark of AmericanKlegecell Corporation. It is made from a blend of plastic resins and exhibits good chemical resistance, is gas tight, vermin proof and waterproof. Moreover, it is extremely strong, light in weight and has superior stiffness, and thermal and acoustical insulativity.It is also substantially non flammable and is compatible with other plastic compositions. Any other plastic which exhibits equivalently high thermal and acoustical insulative properties, light weight, structural strength, rigidity and flame resistance can also be used in place of or in addition to Klegecell. In each panel 60 opposite sides 64 and 66 of core sheet 62 are abutted by flat self supporting sheets 68 and 70 of selected aromid type fibrous plastic material. Sheets 68 and 70 may, for example, have typical thickness as of about .016 to about .063 inch. This plastic material has extremely high tensile strength of the order of five times that of a comparable weight of stainless steel, and much higher than fiberglass and is extremely light in weight, while being flexible, tough and resilient so as to be able to withstand shocks during use in aircraft and other vehicles. Moreover, plastic sheets 68 and 70 are heat resistant and flame retardant. Preferably, sheets 68 and 70 are of material sold under the trademark Kevlar. Kevlar is the registeredU.S. trademark of E. I. DuPont deNemsurs, Wilmington, Delaware. Any suitable aromidtype plastic or other plastic having these properties can be used in addition to or in place of Kevlar plastic for sheets 68 and 70. Unit 20 also includes means interconnecting panels 60 together to form the desired construction.FIGURES 2 10 a demonstrate various interconnected panels 60 used in unit 20. Thus, FIGURES 2 and 3 show horizontal and vertical interconnected outside corner panels. FIGURE 4 illustrates interconnected horizontal and diagonal panels 60. FIGURE 5 illustrates interconnected outside corner horizontal, vertical and diagonal panels 60, and FIGURE 6 illustrates interconnected horizontal and diagonal shelving panels 60.FIGURE 7 illustrates interconnected horizontal and vertical shelving panels 60. FIGURE 8 illustrates interconnected horizontal and vertical panels 60 and FIGURE 9 illustrates interconnected base 22 panels 60 and sidewall 24 or 24 panels 60. FIGURES 10 and 10 a disclose a method of fabricating outside corner joints wherein the outside sheet 80 is left intact and continuous after a 90 degree wedge at 88 is formed in panel 60, with the panel then being folded over 90 degrees to form an outside corner 81. Adhesive layer 72 secures the respective portions of panel 60 together. It should be noted that if excess adhesive 72 is used in the joints, the excess adhesive forms a fillet as shown at 86 to provide additional structural integrity. As shown in FIGURES 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 inclusive, the joined portions of interconnected panels 60 of unit 20 can be notched out in a manner so as to fit flush together. The areas of contact between such panels 60 are sealed together by layers 72 of adhesive, preferably of quick setting plastic bonding material compatible with core 62 and sheets 68 and 70. If desired, core 62 can be directly bonded to sheets 68 and 70, as by adhesive or thermal bonding, for example, at about 250 degrees for 30 minutes or can be air dryed for 24 hours or left unbonded all together, except at layers 72. Other joining means can also be used to interconnect panels 60 in forming unit 20. Thus, FIGURES 3 and 4 show the use of flexible flame retardant plastic cloth strips 74 over the joints of adjoining panels 60.Preferably, strips 74 are also of Kevlar plastic or their equivalent and are thermally or adhesively bonded to panels 60, specifically to adjoining sheets 68 and or 70. Strips 74 may be, for example, about .032 to .063 inches thick. FIGURES 3 and 5 illustrates panels 60 joined together by adhesive layers 72 without notching out of portions of panels 60. FIGURE 9 shows the use of metal or plastic end caps 76, preferably of 6061T3 aluminum, on adjoining panels 60. Caps 76 preferably are about .063 to .090 inches thick and are secured to panels 60 with adhesive layers 72, as shown inFIGURE 9, or can be thermally bonded thereto in the same manner as strips 74 or can otherwise by joined thereto. End caps 76 are also preferably connected together by one or more internal positioning blind fasteners, 78 of aluminum or the like and or can be externally adhesively or otherwise bonded together, for example, with adhesive layer 72. FIGURES 2 9, illustrate.the fact that unit 20 which may, for example, be one of two complementary mirror image units 20 formed an airliner galley or the like, can be easily, securely and conveniently fabricated of panels 60 interconnected as shown inFIGURES 2 9 to form a strong, light weight unitary construction. This construction represents substantial savings in fabrication and maintenance costs. Weight reductions of 25 408 from conventional constructions are obtained. Other advantages are as set forth in the foregoing. Various changes, modifications, alterations and additions can be made in the improved construction of the present invention and in the components and parameters thereof. All such changes, modifications, alterations and additions as are within the scope of the appended claims form part of the present invention.
