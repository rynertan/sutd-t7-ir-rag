## Description
The present invention relates to the insecticidal δ endotoxin protein crystals found in The disclosure hereof is intended to be read in conjunction with the references cited, which are set forth in the appended Bibliography. Varieties of The The toxic moiety of the HD 1 crystal is termed δ endotoxin. The δ endotoxin must be digested by the target insect in order to impart its pathogenicity. The alkaline pH of the insect gut allows for the breakdown of crystal protein leading to gut paralysis and generalized toxemia. Neither intact nor digested crystal is toxic when injected into the insect, but both are toxic when administered orally Angus, 1964 . There also may be interaction between the crystal and spore, enhancing the toxicity. The nature of this interaction is unknown. Yamvrias, 1962 Burges, 1976 . The crystal protein requires a high pH and the presence of reducing agents to solubilize it. The denatured subunits of the crystal protein give molecular weights of about 130 and 134 thousand daltons. There is evidence of a minor separate protein, P2 also called mosquito factor in HD 1 that can be isolated separately from the crystal, has a molecular weight of about 65,000 daltons, and displays toxicity to both lepidoptera and diptera Yamamoto, 1983 . Evidence has been presented that there is more than one structural gene contributing to the formation of the Whiteley s group isolated a plasmid copy from a partial Whiteley s group also used a portion of this clone for probing gene libraries from other strains including Held Klier Klier s group also obtained a plasmid gene copy transformed into Recently, Kronstad, Schnepf and Whiteley 1983 have reported the possible presence of multiple crystal protein genes in several strains of subspecies The recently developed recombinant DNA technology has provided means by which genes can be isolated, induced to higher levels of activity, or altered in nucleotide sequence. Such procedures have been used for a wide range of genetic research experiments, and, increasingly, for the production of proteins of commercial interest. Despite widespread use of such procedures, the isolation and expression of each each gene remains an experimental problem. The specific molecular and biochemical requirements for the efficient synthesis of a protein, and its recovery in a biologically usable form, have not been reduced to general procedures . The biological peculiarities of each gene and its host environment continue to demand creativity and inventiveness on the part of the scientist. Recombinant DNA procedures involve the assembly, In bacterial systems, such recombinant DNA molecules are introduced into cells and thereafter replicated within those cells as either bacteriophage or plasmids. Bacteriophage can be assembled The host cell into which foreign genes are introduced has a substantial effect on the expression of the foreign genes. Typically, the bacterial host used is The expression of foreign proteins in bacteria requires the activity of a collection of interacting mechanisms. RNA synthesis requires the presence of promoter sequences adjacent to the gene. In some instances, the promoters that are situated naturally next to a cloned gene can be utilized by the host gene expression machinery. In other instances, the vector plasmid or bacteriophage must furnish the promoters for expression of the inserted gene. Production of a foreign protein within a bacterial cell requires not only RNA synthesis but also synthesis and accumulation of the encoded protein. Bacterial ribosomes, which carry out protein synthesis, recognize a short binding sequence in RNA which must be encoded by the gene. This ribosome binding site can be part of the inserted gene or can be part of the vector. In some instances the inserted gene is linked to a resident gene in the vector in such a way that a fused protein is made, utilizing the promoter and ribosome binding site of the vector and the amino acid coding sequence of the insert. The amount of protein synthesized can vary widely from gene to gene depending on the regulatory sequences employed and on other factors that are not understood. The fate of a foreign protein is also variable. It may accumulate in as inclusion or intracellular crystal, remain soluble in the cell, be secreted, or break down due to the activity of proteases. The numeral set forth below represent Figure numbers for the appended drawings. The present invention arises from the discovery that the genes for the toxin crystal protein could be located on the endogenous plasmids of The crystal protein produced by The Bacteriophage lambda vectors such as lambda 1059 Karn The The vector pBD64, a recombinant plasmid of pUB110 and pC194 conferring resistance to chloramphenicol and kanamycin, was used for cloning the B.t. toxin gene. Insertion of a foreign DNA segment into the unique BglII site of pBD64 inactivates the gene for kanamycin resistance. DNA of lambda 1059 Bethesda Research Laboratories cut with BamHI is ligated to BgIII fragments of DNA is separated by electrophoresis in gels of 0.75 to 1.2 agarose in 5mM sodium acetate, 2mM EDTA, and 40mM Tris at pH 7.6 at a voltage of 15 to 25 V overnight or 80 120 V for 1 to 4 hours. DNA fragments produced by digestion with restriction nucleases are separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Regions of the gel containing DNA molecules of the desired size are excised, placed in a microcentrifuge tube, and frozen at 70 C. After thawing, the agarose is crushed with a glass rod. Water is added to a total volume of agarose and liquid of 0.5 ml. The suspension is extracted twice with phenol, once with chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Insertion of foreign DNA into a plasmid vector is accomplished by cleaving the foreign and plasmid DNA with restriction enzymes and ligating the fragments together. About 1 mcg of DNA is cleaved with 1 to 10 units of restriction enzyme by incubating them together approximately for 1 hour at 37 C. An appropriate buffer, specified by the enzyme manufacturer, is included in the reaction mixture. The reaction volume is usually 20 microliters. Following the incubation, the DNA is either precipitated with isopropanol when the DNA is to be run on a gel for restriction analysis or phenol and chloroform extracted, then ethanol precipitated when DNA is to be further treated . A restriction digest can produce either blunt or sticky ends. If it is necessary for sticky ends with 5 extensions to be made blunt, the cleaved DNA is incubated with free nucleotides and 5 units of T4 DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment for 30 minutes at 25 C. Prior to ligation, the cleaved vector may be dephosphorylated to prevent self ligation. This is done by heating it at 65 C for 15 minutes with bacterial alkaline phosphatase and the appropriate buffer, followed by phenol chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation. Ligations are carried out by combining DNA fragments and plasmid a workable molar ratio is 4 1 in a 20 microliters volume containing between 2 units for sticky ends and 10 units for blunt ends of ligase in the specified buffer. The mixture is kept at 20 C for several hours. The plasmid constructions thus achieved are transformed into competent Antibodies specific to the B.t. crystal proteins are produced in rabbits by standard procedures. Highly purified crystal proteins are used as the antigen. Renograffin purified crystals are solubilized in a SDS urea sample buffer and the 130 135 kd proteins are resolved on SDS PAGE. The protein bands are visualized with 3M sodium acetate and cut out. The gel slice is injected into rabbits to elicit an immunological response. The antibodies produced are specific For B.t. crystal proteins. The production of B.t. crystal proteins by phage colonies and bacterial clones is detected with the rabbit antibodies. The proteins in the phage colonies are bound to a nitrocellulose filter placed directly on the culture plate. The proteins produced in bacterial clones are resolved by SDS PAGE and then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose sheets. The presence of B.t. crystal proteins is visualized using a double antibody technique. The nitrocellulose sheets and filters are incubated with immune rabbit serum which binds only to the immobilized B.t. crystal proteins. The nitrocellulose is then treated with goat antirabbit IgG which is conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The second antibody only binds to the rabbit antibody. The peroxidase reacts with a reagent, Bio Rad HRP color development reagent, which produces a color reaction where the antibodies bind to the B.t crystal proteins on the nitrocellulose. Synthetic DNA probes are constructed manually using the phosphoramidite chemistry Matteuci and Caruthers 1981 and purified by standard PAGE techniques. A probe which is complementary to the first fifteen coding bases of the B.t. crystal protein gene will specifically hybridize to cloned DNA containing that sequence. Bacterial transformants are spotted and grown on nitrocellulose filters placed on culture media. The cells are lysed by floating the filters on 0.5M NaOH and then neutralized with 1M Tris pH 7.4. The filters are then treated with 1.5M NaCl, 0.5M Tris pH 7.4 , prior to being baked at 80 C for one hour. Filters are first washed in 6X SSC and then washed in 50mM Tris pH 8.0 , 1M NaCl, 1mM EDTA and 0.1 SDS. The filters are prehybridized in 50mM iris pH 7.4, 1M NaCl, 10mM EDTA, 5X Denhardt s solution, 0.1 SDS, and calf thymus DNA, 0.1 mg ml at 32 C for 3 hours. The filters are hybridized at 32 C in the same solution which contains the synthetic probe or a nick translated probe labeled with ³²P ATP. The probe is removed by washing the filters with 2X SSC, 0.1 SDS and 0.1 Na pyrophosphate. Clones which hybridize to the probe are located by autoradiography. The clones are tested for toxicity by feeding cell extracts to insects, primarily The parasporal crystals of B.t. are purified on linear preformed gradients of Renografin 76, sodium diatrizoate, according to the method of Sharpe Purified EM grade glutaraldehyde Ted Pella Co., Tustin, Calif. is added to cell suspensions final conc. 0.2 , mixed and then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. During the prefixation period 2 agar in water is first boiled and then cooled to 40 C in a water bath. The cell suspension is pelleted at 1500 Xg, the supernatant discarded and the tube containing the pellet placed in the water bath and allowed to equilibrate about 5 min at 40 C. Using a prewarmed Pasteur pipette, about 0.5 ml of the agar is transferred to the cell pellet and mixed so that the bacterial cells became suspended in the agar. A portion of the suspension is next drawn up into the tip of the pipette, allowed to cool briefly to room temperature and expelled into ice cold phosphate buffered 3 glutaraldehyde. The resulting cylindrical shaped congealed agar plugs containing the bacteria are further fixed in the glutaraldehyde for from 3 to 18 hours, washed in phosphate buffer and cut into small pieces. Samples are next post fixed 1 hour in phosphate buffered 1 osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols, and embedded in a Epon Araldite embedding mixture. Following thin sectioning, samples are stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The bacteria are examined by electron microscopy for presence of crystalline inclusions at magnifications ranging from 10 30,000x. Competent cells are prepared as described by Dubnau and Davidoff Abelson 1971 . Plasmid transformation is performed as described by Contente and Dubnau 1979 . Plasmid DNA and competent cells are incubated at 37 C for 30 min using 1 3 mcg DNA per ml. EGTA 1 mM is used in the competent cell DNA mixture. Selection for antibiotic resistance was carried out by the overlay method in TBAB agar after 90 min delay at 37 C to allow for expression. Selective concentrations of chloramphenicol and kanamycin are 5 mcg ml. The clones identified as positive by Southern hybridization and by expression as identified by Western blotting are grown in 1 liter cultures in LB medium at 30 C for 2 days. After harvesting and washing the cellular pellet, it is sonicated for 3 minutes, shell freezed and lyophilized. This powdered preparation is tested for toxicity to insects. The The following examples are intended to illustrate but not to limit the invention. Suitable strains of Cloning of 135,000 dalton δ endotoxin protein specifying genes from E I A. Construction of a plasmid library of B.t. genes. A plasmid library of HD 1 DNA was constructed with plasmid pUC9 and JM83 cells. Plasmid pUC9 was opened at the universal cloning site with restriction enzyme BamHI. The plasmid, 60 ng, was ligated with 2 mcg of BglII cut HD 1 DNA in a 20 microliter reaction mixture using 2 units of T4DNA ligase. The ligation mix was then used to transform competent E I B. Expression of a 135,000 dalton B.t. δ endotoxin protein by the recombinant The Results from Figure 2 show that the recombinant plasmid pHBHE expresses a gene encoding a protein of the size of about 135,000 daltons and that this protein has the same mobility as that of the HD1 crystal protein. Lanes 1, 2 and 3 show the proteins from the parent B.t. strain HD 1, the E I C.

Construction of the recombinant plasmid carrying the δ endotoxin gene of The recombinant plasmid pHBHE described in Example I was used as the source of 1 mcg of linearized and blunted pBD64 was then mixed with about 4 mcg of HincII SmaI double digest of pHBHE and joined with ligase. Extent of ligation was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis. The ligated DNA was then introduced into the competent cells of The mapping of the recombinant plasmids from some of these transformants by restriction enzymes indicated that the insert could be present in either orientation. One of them, present in orientation A, was designated as pABS 5 and the other in opposite orientation was designated as pABS 9. The sequence of construction events is shown in Figure 6. Another recombinant plasmid pABS 59 was constructed by ligating the HincII SmaI double digest of pHBHE to the unique PvuII site of pBD64, transforming into competent PSLI cells and screening by colony hybridization and colony immuneblotting. E II B. Expression of The strains containing recombinant plasmids pABS 5, pABS 9, and pABS 59 are designated as ABS 5, ABS 9 and ABS 59, respectively. ABS 5, ABS 9 and ABS 59 were grown in Luria broth medium containing 5 mcg ml of chloramphenicol for 16 hours at 30 C in a shaking incubator. The cells were spun and washed once in buffer A 60 mM NH₄Cl, 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM β mercaptoethanol, 2 mm PMSF, 10 glycerol and 1 M KCl and twice in TESP buffer 30 mM Tris Hcl, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM PMSF. The cells were lysed in 1 mg ml lysozyme in TESP, mixed with equal volume of 2x sample buffer 12 M urea, 5 SDS, 2 β mercaptoethanol, 0.25 M Tris HCl, pH 6.8 , boiled for 10 min cooled and spun. The clear supernatant was analyzed for proteins by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Figure 7A shows the proteins separated and stained on a 8 polyacrylamide gel. Figure 7B shows a western blotting of the proteins. It is clear from the figure that strains ABS 5, ABS 9 and ABS 59 Lanes 3, 5 and 8 do express a protein of about 135,000 daltons and that this protein reacts specifically with the antibody for B.t. crystal protein. Lanes 1 and 7 show proteins from the The formation of well defined bipyramidal crystalline structures by ABS 5 and ABS 9 were noticed by transmission electron micrography and are shown in Figures 3A and 3B. The following facts also indicate that the B.t. toxin gene cloned in E II C. Expression of ABS 5 was grown overnight about 16 hours at 30 C in LB medium containing 5 m c ml chloramphenicol. A culture of HD 1 Dipel was also grown in LB medium. Aliquots were diluted 100 fold into their respective fresh cultures in the morning and growth was monitored in a Klett colorimeter. Aliquots were removed at regular intervals from both cultures, extracts were made as described in Example EIIB and the proteins were separated by 8 SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Figure 8 shows a growth curve of the two cultures. Figure 9A shows the stained proteins and Figure 9B shows a western blotting of the proteins. It is clear from the figure see figure legends for description , that the E II D. Electron Microscopic Examination. The ABS 5 strain was grown in LB medium containing 5 mcg ml chloramphenicol, overnight 16 hours at 30 C and subcultured by dilution 100 fold into fresh medium in the morning. Aliquots were removed at regular intervals and processed for transmission electron microscopy as described in Methods, Figure 10 shows some electron microscopic sections of cultures of ABS 5 at different stages of growth. For comparison, HD 1 Dipel strain was also grown in LB medium, and aliquots removed at different stages of growth were processed similarly for transmission electron microscopy. Figure 11 shows EM sections of B.t. at different stages see figure legends for description . The appearance of small crystalline structures were apparent at as early as 13 hours in E II E. Expression of the recombinant plasmid pABS 5 in a recombination deficient mutant of In order to show that the stability of the recombinant plasmid and expression of the insecticidal protein in the form of crystals is not due to the property of the strain PSLI, it was necessary to move the recombinant plasmid into another strain with a different background. The BD 224 cells were made competent by the usual procedure as described in Methods, E II F. Expression of the recombinant plasmid pABS 9 in a sporulation deficient mutant of To clarify that the toxin gene cloned in The Competent cells of IS 160 were prepared as described in the Methods section, Cell extracts were made from ABS 57 and analyzed For proteins by electrophoresis on a 8 SDS polyacrylamide gel. The stained proteins are shown in Lane 6 of Figure 7A and a western blot of the same proteins is shown in lane 6 of Figure 7B. It is clear from the figure that the plasmid pABS 9 in ABS 57 does express a protein of about 135,000 daltons which is immunologically reactive with the antibody for the crystal protein. Thus, sporulation is unnecessary for expression of E II G. Expression of the reco binant plasmid pABS 9 in a root colonizing A 13 is a The recombinant plasmid pABS 9 was introduced into A 13 by transduction using a generalized transducing phage AR9 Belyaeva and Azizbekyan, 1968 . Selection was for chloramphenicaol using 5 mg ml. The plasmid DNA isolated from these transductants were found tob be similar to pABS 9. This root colonizing Cell extracts made from ABS 65 were analyzed for proteins by electrophores on a 8 SDS polyacrylamide gel and the expression of a 135,000 dalton δ endotoxin protein was confirmed by Western blotting analysis.

Construction of lambda 1059 library of B.t. genes and cloning of a toxin gene in A gene from the HD1 Dipel strain of B.t. that encodes the 130,000 d toxic protein was cloned in bacteriophage lambda 1059. B.t. DNA was cut with BglII and mixed with lambda 1059 DNA that had been cut with BamHI. T4 DNA ligase 40 units was added, with reaction buffer to a final volume of 20 microliters. The ligation reaction was carried out overnight at 16 C. One fourth of the ligated DNA solution was added to 50 microliters of lambda packaging extract Pakagene Biotec and the mixture was held at 22 C for 2 hours. One ml of SM buffer was added along with 25 m l of chloroform as a preservative. A volume of 0.1 ml of a 10 ¹ dilution of the packaged recombinant phage was mixed with DNA was isolated from the recombinant phage lambda S4B, which has a strong immunoblot reaction, and partially digested with the restriction enzyme Sau3A. The DNA fragments were ligated into the plasmid pUC9 which had been cut with BamHI. The resulting recombinant plasmids were then screened by an immunoblot assay. One of the positive clones, named LSS2, contained 8.3 kb of B.t. DNA, and encoded the 130 kd B.t. crystal protein. A fragment of the LSS2 insert DNA, generated by digestion with restriction nuclease HincII, was subcloned into pUC9 also cut with HincII. This subclone codes for the 130 kd protein and is named pHC45. The sequence of events leading to the construction of pHC45 is shown in figure 12. E III B. Expression of a 130,000 dalton polypeptide by pHC45. The Results from Figure 13 confirm that the recombinant plasmid pHC45 does express in Lane 6 in Figure 13A shows the Coomassie blue stained proteins expressed by the vector pUC9 alone and lane 5 shows the proteins expressed by pHC45. Lanes 6 and 5 in figure 13b show a western blot of the proteins from pUC9 and pHC45. It is clearly seen that the pHC45 reacts specifically with the antibody to B.t. crystal protein. Cloning in E IV A. Construction of a recombinant plasmid pBSW7. The recombinant plasmid pHBHE described in Example I was used as a source of the promoter region and the recombinant plasmid pHC45 described in Example II, E II A, was used as the source of the toxin structural gene for the construction of a new recombinant plasmid pBSW7. The plasmid pHBHE was digested with the restriction enzyme ClaI and dephosphorylated using bacterial alkaline phosphatase. It was then treated with a second enzyme SmaI. The 3.0 kb fragment consisting of the pUC 9 portion along with the promoter region between HincII and ClaI sites of the toxin gene insert was isolated and purified from an agarose gel. The plasmid pHC45 was cut with PstI and SmaI and then partially digested with the restriction enzyme ClaI. The fragments were separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel and a 3.6 kb fragment was isolated and purified. Identity of both the 3.0 kb and 3.6 kb fragments were checked by restriction analyses. These were then mixed and ligated in presence of T4 DNA ligase.
