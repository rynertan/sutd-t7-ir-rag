# Circuit testing utilizing data compression and derivative mode vectors.

## Abstract
A circuit tester and test method are described that com press the amount of data stored in local test data RAMS 13 for the implementation of a circuit test, thereby reducing the amount of data that must be downloaded to the local test data RAMs 13 , thereby improving test throughput. Derivative data vectors are utilized in addition to raw data vectors as part of the data compression technique. Further compression results from storing only unique data vectors in the local test data RAMs 13 and utlizing a sequencer 16 to control the order in which the unique data vectors are utilized. The sequ encer includes test program logic 15, 17 and logic capable of implementing on test pins indirect counters 19 .
