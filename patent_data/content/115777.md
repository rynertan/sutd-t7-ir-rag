## Description
METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF BASE SEQUENCE OF DNA OR DNA FRAGMENT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment. More particularly, this invention relates to a method for sequencing DNA or DNA fragment utilizing the conventional auto radiography or the radiation image recording and reproducing method using a stimulable phosphor sheet.DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ARTS Autoradiography has been known as a method for obtaining locational information on radioactively labeled substances distributed in at least one dimensional direction to form a row on a support medium. For instance, the autoradiography comprises steps of labeling organism originating biopolymers such as proteins or nucleic acids with a radioactive element resolving the radioactively labeled biopolymers, derivatives thereof or cleavage products thereof hereinafter referred to as radioactively labeled substances on a gel support support medium through a resolving process such as electrophoresis to form a resolved pattern of the radioactively labeled substances the resolved pattern is not visible placing said support medium and a high sensitivity typeX ray film together in layers for a certain period of time to expose the film and developing said film to give the autoradiograph of the resolved pattern as a visible image on the film and obtaining the locational information on the radioactively labeled substances from said visible image.Further, the identification of the polymeric substances, determination of molecular weight of the polymeric substances and isolation of the polymeric substances are performed based on the obtained locational information. The autoradiography has been effectively utilized for determining the base sequence of nucleic acids such as DNA or DNA fragment, hereinafter DNA may be used to include both DNA and DNA fragment or the like. Maxam Gilbert method and Sanger Coulson method are known as methods for sequencing DNA utilizing the autoradiography. In these methods, the base sequence of DNA is determined by geniously utilizing the characteristic structure of DNA that DNA is in the form of a double helix structure, which consists of two chain molecules stabilized through hydrogen bonding between two bases on each chain molecule, and that the base, which comprises a part of constitutional unit of DNA, is limited to only four, which are adenine A , guanine G , cytosine C , and thymine T , and that the hydrogen bonding between each constitutional base unit comprises only two combinations, namely, G C and A T. For instance, Maxam Gilbert method is performed by the procedure described below. A group containing a radioactive isotope of phosphorus P is attached to a chain molecule of DNA or a DNA fragment at one end to be sequenced to prepare a radioactively labeled DNA molecule, and then the radioactively labeled DNA molecule is specificaly cleaved at the consti tutional unit containing a certain base by a certain chemical reaction to obtain, for instance, the following four kinds of base specific cleavage products. 1 guanine specific cleavage products, 2 guanine specific cleavage products adenine specific cleavage products, 3 thymine specific cleavage products cytosine specific cleavage products, and 4 cytosine specific cleavage products. Then, each of the cleavage products is resolved all together in parallel on the same gel support through gel electrophoresis to obtain a resolved pattern consisting of rows of the cleavage products respectively resolved in one dimensional directions the pattern is not visible . The above described autoradiography is then performed on the rows of the resolved cleavage products to obtain a visible image of the autoradiograph on a radiographic film. In the case of employing the above described set of cleavage products, the visualized autoradiograph shows the following four kinds of the resolved rows 1 a resolved row indicating resolved positions of the guanine specific cleavage products, 2 a resolved row indicating resolved positions of both the guanine specific cleavage products and the adenine specific cleavage products, 3 a resolved row indicating resolved positions of both the thymine specific cleavage products and the cytosine specific cleavage products, and 4 a resolved row indicating resolved positions of the cytosine specific cleavage products. In the sequencing method, for instance, the resolved row 1 and row 2 are compared therebetween to identify the resolved positions for both the guanine specific cleavage products and the adenine specific cleavage products, respectively. Further, comparison between the resolved row 3 and row 4 is performed to identify the resolved positions for both the thymine specific cleavage products and the cytosine specific cleavage products, respectively. Thus, the resolved positions are identified on all the base specific cleavage products, namely, the guanine G specific cleavage products, the adenine A specific cleavage products, the thymine T specific cleavage products and the cytosine C specific cleavage products1 respectively. Since the migration distances of the cleavage products are in adversely proportional to the molecular weight thereof, all bases can be sequenced by identifying the positions of bases sequentially from the radioactively labeled end of the chain molecule. Accordingly, the autoradiography for base sequencing of DNA using a radiographic film is advantageous in that the locational information on radioactively labeled substances can be observed visually. However, the conventional autoradiography employing, for instance, the above described set of the cleavage products, has a drawback. For instance, a gel support medium is generally held between two glass plates in the resolving procedure because the gel lacks self supporting property. As a result, the gel occasionally becomes uneven in the thickness due to the deformation of the covers such as glass plates and accordingly the radioactively labeled substances are not always resolved uniformly on the gel.The lack of uniformity of the resolved pattern is also caused by air foams contained in the gel or by heterogenous dispersion of the composition of gel. For these reasons, a phenomenon such as the so called smiling effect, i.e., a phenomenon that the migration distance of the resolved row in the vicinity of the center of the support medium is longer than those in both sides thereof, is often observed. Additionally, in electrophoresis, if the voltage is not applied uniformly to the support medium in electrophoresis, the resolving conditions are made locally uneven on the support medium to distort the resolved rows. For these reasons, accurate identification of the resolved positions of the base specific cleavage products based on the above described comparison method is not easy as far as the conventional comparison method is employed.Accordingly, the conventional comparison method is a serious problem in the base sequencing of DNA or DNA fragment. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a method for determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment improved in the accuracy of sequencing. There is provided by the present invention a method for determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment comprising steps of 1 resolving radioactively labeled base specific cleavage products obtained by base specific cleavage of a radioactively labeled DNA or DNA fragment on a support medium to produce at least one resolved cleavage product row 2 copying said resolved product row onto a radiographic film to form a visible image and 3 determining base sequence of the DNA or DNA fragment based on positions of the resolved cleavage products shown on the visible image, which is characterized in that said step 1 comprises simultaneously resolving a mixture of cleavage products of the DNA or DNA fragment comprising four kinds of radioactively labeled cleavage products obtained respectively by base specifically cleaving radioactively labeled DNA or DNA fragment at different constitutional base positions on the same support medium and that said step 3 comprises comparing and identifying, by referring to the resolved positions of the reference mixture of cleavage products detected in a resolved row thereof, the resolved positions of the base specific cleavage products detected in the other resolved row thereof. The present invention further provides a method for determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment utilizing a radiation image recording and reproducing method employing a stimulable phosphor sheet, comprising steps of 1 resolving radioactively labeled base specific cleavage products obtained by base specific cleavage of a radioactively labeled DNA or DNA fragment on a support medium to produce at least one resolved cleavage product row 2 copying said resolved product row onto a stimulable phosphor sheet in the form of a radiation energy stored image 3 scanning said phosphor sheet with an electromagnetic wave to release at least a portion of radiation energy stored in said phosphor sheet as stimulated emission to detect locational information on the resolved radioactively labeled cleavage products and 4 determining base sequence of the DNA or DNA fragment based on said locational information detected in the step 3 , which is characterized in that said step 1 comprises simultaneously resolving a mixture of cleavage products of the DNA or DNA fragment comprising four kinds of radioactively labeled cleavage products obtained respectively by base specifically cleaving radioactively labeled DNA or DNA fragment at different constitutional base positions on the same support medium and that said step 4 comprises comparing and identifying, by referring to the resolved positions of the reference mixture of cleavage products detected in a resolved row thereof, the resolved positions of the base specific cleavage products detected in the other resolved row thereof. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a schematic view of an autoradiograph of resolved rows given by resolution of a set of radioactively labeled DNA base specific cleavage products and a mixture thereof on a support medium. Figure 2 shows an example of the read out system for reading out the locational information on radioactively labeled products copied from the sample and stored in a stimulable phosphor sheet employable in the embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION There is no limitation on DNA or DNA fragment to be sequenced according to the present invention, and examples of DNA and DNA fragment include a variety of DNA, fragments of DNA specifically cleaved at an optional position thereof, as well as their derivatives. The arts relating to the procedure for labeling DNA or DNA fragment or to the procedure for obtaining the radioactively labeled base specific cleavage products by applying a base specific cleaving reaction to the radioactively labeled DNA or DNA fragment is known. These arts are employable in the present invention.For instance, the representative arts on the above mentioned procedures are briefly given in Reading the genetic information in the original language A surprising method for sequencing the bases of DNA written in Japanese by Kin ichiro Miura, Modern Chemistry,September 1977, pp. 46 54 Tokyo Kagaku Dozin Ltd.,Japan . More detailed description on the procedure is given in METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY, VOL. 65, PART I ACADEMICPRESS, NEW YORK LONDON TRONTO SYDNEY SAN FRANCISCO, 1980 Representative examples of the method for resolving or developing the above mentioned radioactively labeled products on a support medium include an electrophoresis using one of various resolving medium such as a gel in the form of layer, column or the like, a moled polymer film such as a cellulose diacetate film, and a filter paper, and a thin layer chromatography using a support medium of such as silica gel. Among these, the electrophoresis using a gel support medium is preferably employed in the present invention. The method for determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment according to the present invention is described hereinafter, utilizing the above mentionedMaxam Gilbert method and referring to a typical example using a combination of five base specific cleavage products or mixture given below 1 guanine G specific cleavage products adenine A specific cleavage products thymine T specific cleavage products cytosine C specific cleavage products, 2 guanine G specific cleavage products, 3 guanine G specific cleavage products adenine A specific cleavage products, 4 thymine A specific cleavage products cytosine C specific cleavage products, and 5 cytosine C specific cleavage products. The mixture 1 contains four kinds of the base specific cleavage products and is employed for forming a resolved row for reference. DNA labeled with a radioactive element 32P is specifically cleaved at the constitutional base units by chemical reactions according to the conventional manner, respectively to prepare a set of the base specific cleavage products 2 through 5 , in which the cleavage products are radioactively labeled. Some of these cleavage products are appropriately mixed to prepare the radioactively labeled base specific cleavage product mixure 1 . The cleavage product mixture 1 and respective cleavage products 2 through 5 are resolved in parallel by electrophoresis on one gel support medium in such manner that the the mixture 1 is resolved in the center, to produce five rows of the resolved cleavage products the resolved rows are not visible . The support medium carrying the rows of the cleavage products thereon is superposed on a radiographic film at a low temperature e.g., 70 900C for several days to perform the exposing procedure. The exposed radiographic film is then developed to give a visible image of the autoradiograph. Figure 1 shows an autoradiograph of five resolved rows of the radioactively labeled base specific cleavage products and their mixtures 1 a resolved row indicating resolved positions of the guanine G specific cleavage products, 2 a resolved row indicating resolved positions of both the guanine G specific cleavage products and the adenine A specific cleavage products, 3 a resolved row indicating resolved positions of the thymine T specific cleavage products, the cytosine C specific cleavage products, the guanine G specific cleavage products, and the adenine A specific cleavage products, 4 a resolved row indicating resolved positions of both the thymine T specific cleavage products and the cytosine C specific cleavage products, and 5 a resolved row indicating resolved positions of the cytosine C specific cleavage products. The third row, i.e., above mentioned row 3 is a resolved row indicating resolved positions of all base specific cleavage products G, A, T, C and is employed as an internal reference row reference row for determination of the base sequence. Identification of the resolved cleavage products distributed in each of the resolved rows in the form of belts utilizing the internal reference row can be done, for instance, as follows In the first step, the third row internal reference row and the adjacent second row are compared therebetween. Since the internal reference row indicates the resolved positions of all kinds of the base specific clea vage products, all of the resolved positions of the G specific cleavage products and A specific cleavage products shown in the second row necessarily correspond to a part of the resolved positions shown in the internal reference row.Accordingly, an observed dislocation between the internal reference row and the second row can be correctly detected for identification by the comparison between all of the resolved positions in the second row and the corresponding positions in the internal reference row. In the second step, the third row internal reference row and the adjacent fourth row are compared therebetween. Since the internal reference row indicates the resolved positions of all kinds of the base specific cleavage products, all of the resolved positions of the T specific cleavage products and C specific cleavage products shown in the fourth row necessarily correspond to a part of the resolved positions shown in the internal re ference row. Further, since the resolved positions in the second row and fourth row are exclusive of each other, the resolved positions in the fourth row are more accurately identificated or assigned utilizing said exclusive relation.Accordingly, an observed dislocation between the internal reference and the fourth row can be correctly detected for identification by the comparison between all of the resolved positions in the fourth row and the corresponding positions in the internal reference row. In the final steps, the resolved positions of G specific cleavage products and A specific cleavage products are respectively identified by comparison between the the second resolved row and the first resolved row.Likewise, the resolved positions of T specific cleavage products and C specific cleavage products are respectively identified by comparison between the the fourth resolved row and the fifth resolved row. In these comparison procedures for identification of the resolved postions of the base specific cleavage products, the degree of dislocation of resolved positions detected therein can be taken into consideration for other comparison to make the comparison and identification easy and accurate. Accordingly, the method of determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment exemplified as above makes the identification of the base specific cleavage products more easy and accurate in comparison with the conventional method involving the resolution of four base specific cleavage products groups G, G A, T C, T or the resolution of the simple set of four base specific cleavage products groups G, A, C, T . In the above description, the resoluiton is described in the example using the internal reference row resolved in the center among the other rows. However, the internal reference row can be arranged in an optional position. Moreover, the internal reference row can be arranged plurally. For instance, if the internal reference row and the other row can be arranged alternately, the identification of the resolved positions of each base specific cleavage products is made more easy and accurate. The above described combination of G A T C, G, A G,T C, and C is one example of the combinatons of the base specific cleavage products employable in the method for determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment of the present invention. Other various combinations can be also employable for performing the base sequencing in a substantially same manner as in the above. For instance, a combination including four kinds of simple cleavage products of 1 guanine specific cleavage products, 2 adenine specific cleavage products, 3 thymine specific cleavage products, and 4 cytosine specific cleavage products, can be employed in combination of the mixture of the base specific cleavage products for internal reference. Furthermore, although the above description is given in the arrangement of five cleavage products resolved rows respectively distributed on a support medium in one dimensional directions, the number of the resolved rows are not restricted thereto. The rows can be in a number less than or more than five. For instance, a combination of the following cleavage products a guanine G specific cleavage products, and b guanine G specific cleavage products adenine A specific cleavage products thymine T specific cleavage products cytosine C specific cleavage products, can be employed for the determination of simply the guanine G positions in DNA or DNA fragment. Accordingly, the determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment includes the determination of all base sequence as well as the determination of sequence of a part of the constitutional bases as exemplified above. In addition, although the description given hereinbefore is concerned with an embodiment in which the determination of base sequence is performed on one kind of DNA orDNA fragment on a support medium, a single support medium can be employed for simultaneous determinations of base sequences of a number of DNA or DNA fragments. The analysis of the visualized autoradiograph on a radiographic film can be done by eyes, but a certain devices such as a scanning densitometer can be also utilized for the analysis. The method for determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment can be performed utilizing a radiation image recording and reproducing method in which a stimulable phosphor sheet is employed. The stimulable phosphor sheet employable in the present invention has been alternatively mentioned in the name of a radiation image storage panel, and described in, for instance, U. S. Patent No. 4,239,968. Accordingly, the general constitution of the stimulable phosphor sheet is already known. The stimulable phosphor sheet is used to record and reproduce the image produced by the radiation energy having passed through an object or having been radiated by an object. The radiation image recording and reproducing process comprises steps of causing the stimulable phosphor of the phosphor sheet to absorb a radiation energy having passed through an object or having been radiated by an object exciting the stimulable phosphor with an electromagnetic wave such as visible light or infrared rays hereinafter referred to as stimulating rays to sequentially release the radiation energy stored in the stimulable phosphor as light emission photoelectrically detecting the emitted light to give an electric signal and reproducing the electric signal in the form of a visible image on a recording material such as a photosensitive film or on a display device. The stimulable phosphor sheet preferably employed in the autoradiography of the present invention is described briefly in the following. The stimulable phosphor sheet has a basic structure comprising a substrate and a phosphor layer provided on one surface of the substrate. Further, a transparent film is generally provided on the free surface surface not facing the substrate of the phosphor layer to keep the phosphor layer from chemical deterioration or physical shock. The phosphor layer comprises a binder and a stimu lable phosphor dispersed therein. When excited with an electromagnetic wave such as visible light or infrared rays after having been exposed to a radiation, the stimulable phosphor emits light stimulated emission . Accordingly, a radiation having been radiated from a sample containing the radioactively labeled substances, for instance, is absorbed by the phosphor layer of the stimulable phosphor sheet in proportion to the radiation dose, and a radiation image of the sample is stored in the stimulable phosphor sheet in the form of a radiation energy stored image. The stored image can be released as stimulated emission light emission by applying an electromagnetic wave such as visible light or infrared rays stimulating rays onto the stimulable phosphor sheet.The stimulated emission is then photoelectrically detected to convert it to electric signals, and thus the radiation energy stored image can be converted to a visible image or numeral and or symbol which represent the locational information on the radioactive substance, namely, the radioactively labeled substance. A material of the substrate of the stimulable phosphor sheet employed in the present invention can be selected from those employed in the conventional radiographic intensifying screens. Examples of the substrate material include plastic films such as films of cellulose acetate, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, polyimide, triacetate and polycarbonate metal sheets such as aluminum foil and aluminum alloy foil ordinary papers baryta paper resin coated papers pigment papers containing titanium dioxide or the like and papers sized with polyvinyl alcohol or the like. From a viewpoint of characteristics of a stimulable phosphor sheet as the information recording material, a plastic film is preferably employed as the substrate material of the invention.The plastic film may contain a light absorbing material such as carbon black, or may contain a light reflecting material such as titanium dioxide. The former is appropriate for a high sharpness type stimulable phosphor sheet, while the latter is appropriate for a high sensitivity type stimulable phosphor sheet. In the preparation of a known stimulable phosphor sheet, one or more additional layers are occasionally provided between the substrate and the phosphor layer, so as to enhance the adhesion between the substrate and the phosphor layer, or to improve the sensitivity of the sheet or the quality of an image provided thereby. For instance, a subbing layer or an adhesive layer may be provided by coating a polymer material such as gelatin over the surface of the substrate on the phosphor layer side.Otherwise, a light reflecting layer or a light absorbing layer may be provided by forming a polymer material layer containing a light reflecting material such as titanium dioxide or a light absorbing material such as carbon black. One or more of these additional layers may be provided depending on the type of the stimulable phosphor sheet to be obtained. As described in Japanese Patent Application No.57 1982 82431 which corresonds to U. S. Patent Application No. 496,278 and the whole content of which is described in European Patent Publication No. 92241 , the phosphor layer side surface of the substrate or the surface of an adhesive layer, light reflecting layer, or light absorbing layer in the case where such layers provided on the phosphor layer may be provided with protruded and depressed portions for enhancement of the sharpness of radiographic image, and the constitution of those protruded and depressed portions can be selected depending on the purpose of the stimulable phosphor sheet to be prepared. Onto the above mentioned substrate, a phosphor layer is provided. The phosphor layer comprises basically a binder and stimulable phosphor particles dispersed therein. The stimulable phosphor, as described hereinbefore, gives stimulated emission when excited by stimulating rays after exposure to a radiation. From the viewpoint of practical use, the stimulable phosphor is desired to give stimulated emission in the wavelength region of 300 500 nm when excited by stimulating rays in the wavelength region of 400 850 nm. Examples of the stimulable phosphor employable in the stimulable phosphor sheet utilized in the present invention include SrS Ce,Sm, SrS Eu,Sm, ThO2 Er, and La202S Eu,Sm, as described in U.S. Patent

The above described stimulable phosphor are given by no means to restrict the stimulable phosphor employable in the present invention. Any other phosphors can be also employed, provided that the phosphor gives stimulated emission when excited with stimulating rays after exposure to a radiation. In carrying out the autoradiographic process of the present invention, a divalent europium activated alkaline earth metal fluorohalide stimulable phosphor is preferably employed. Examples of the binder to be contained in the phosphor layer include natural polymers such as proteins e.g., gelatin , polysaccharides e.g., dextran and gum arabic and synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl acetate, nitrocellulose, ethylcellulose, vinylidene chloride vinyl chloride copolymer, polymethyl methacrylate, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copoymer, polyurethane, cellulose acetate butyrate, polyvinyl alcohol, and linear polyester. Particularly preferred are nitrocellulose, linear polyester, and a mixture of nitrocellulose and linear polyester. The phosphor layer can be formed on the substrate, for instance, by the following procedure. In the first place, stimulable phosphor particles and a binder are added to an appropriate solvent for example, lower alcohol, chlorinated hydrocarbon, ketone, ester, or ether , and then they are mixed to prepare a homogeneous coating dispersion of the phosphor particles in the binder solution. The ratio between the binder and the stimulable phosphor in the coating dispersion may be determined according to the characteristics of the aimed stimulable phosphor sheet and the nature of the phosphor employed. Generally, the ratio therebetween is within the range of from 1 1 to 1 100 binder phosphor, by weight , preferably from 1 8 to 1 40. The coating dispersion may contain a dispersing agent to increase the dispersibility of the phosphor particles therein, and also contain a variety of additives such as a plasticizer for increasing the bonding between the binder and the phosphor particles in the phosphor layer. Examples of the dispersing agent include phthalic acid, stearic acid, caproic acid and a hydrophobic surface active agent. Examples of the plasticizer include phosphates such as triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate and diphenyl phosphate phthalates such as diethyl phthalate and dimethoxyethyl phthalate glycolates such as ethylphthalyl ethyl glycolate and butylphthalyl butyl glycolate and polyesters of polyethylene glycols with aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as polyester of triethylene glycol with adipic acid and polyester of diethylene glycol with succinic acid. The coating dispersion containing the phosphor particles and the binder prepared as described above is applied evenly to the surface of the substrate to form a layer of the coating dispersion. The coating procedure can be carried out by a conventional method such as a method using a doctor blade, a roll coater or a knife coater. After applying the coating dispersion to the substrate, the coating dispersion is then heated slowly to dryness so as to complete the formation of a phosphor layer. The thickness of the phosphor layer varies depending upon the characteristics of the aimed stimulable phosphör sheet, the nature of the phosphor, the ratio between the binder and the phosphor, etc. Generally, the thickness of the phosphor layer is within a range of from 20 um to 1 mm, preferably from 50 to 500 vm. The phosphor layer can be provided onto the substrate by the methods other than that given in the above. For instance, the phosphor layer is initially prepared on a sheet false substrate such as a glass plate, a metal plate or a plastic sheet using the aforementioned coating dispersion and then thus prepared phosphor layer is overlaid on the genuine substrate by pressing or using an adhesive agent. As described above, a protective film are prferably provided on the phosphor layer. The protective film is generally prepared from a transparent cellulose derivative such as cellulose acetate or nitrocellulose or a transparent synthetic polymer such as polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, polycarbonate, polyvinyl acetate, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polyvinylidene chloride or polyamide. The protective film preferably has a thickness within the range of 0.1 100 vm, and more preferably within the range of 0.3 50 Vm. One embodiment of the present invention employs the stimulable phosphor sheet having the above described constitution as the radiosensitive mat erial in the autoradiography in place of the conventional radiographic film. The exposing procedure of the invention can be done by placing the stimulable phosphor sheet and a sample containing a radioactively labeled substance together in layers for a certain period of time so as to have at least a portion of a radiation emitted by the radioactively labeled substance in the sample absorbed by the stimulable phosphor sheet. In carrying out the above mentioned exposing procedure, the temporary combination of the sample with the stimulable phosphor sheet is generally done by placing the sample in close contact with the phosphor sheet, but the contact is not required to be so close, and the exposure can be accomplished by keeping the phosphor sheet in a position adjacent to the sample. The exposure time varies depending on the radioactivity of the radioactively labeled substance in the sample, the concentration of said substance, the sensitivity of the stimulable phosphor sheet, and the distance between the sample and the stimulable phosphor sheet, but in general the exposure is required to be done for a certain period of time, for instance, more than several seconds.In the case of employing the stimulable phosphor sheet as the radiosensitive material, however, the exposure time can be greatly reduced as compared with the exposure time required in the case employing the conventional radiographic film. Further, a precise control of the exposure time is not required in the case of employing the stimulable phosphor sheet, because the locational information on the radioactively labeled substances in the sample which has been copied from the sample through the exposing procedure can be electrically processed depending upon intensity of radiation energy emitted thereby, and distribution of the stored energy. There is no specific limitation on the temperature for carrying out the exposing procedure, but it is advantageously characteristic aspect attached to the employment of the stimulable phosphor sheet in the autoradiography according to the present invention, that the exposure can be performed at an ambient temperature such as a temperature within 10 350C. The exposure may be carried out, however, even at a low temperature, for instance, in the vicinity of 5 0C or lower as adopted in the conventional autoradiography. A method for reading out the locational information on the radioactively labeled substances in the sample copied and stored in the stimulable phosphor sheet according to the invention will be described briefly, referring to an embodiment of a read out system shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 schematically illustrates an embodiment of the read out system comprising a preliminary read out section 2 for preliminarily reading out the one or two dimensional information on the location of the radioactively labeled substances stored or recorded in the stimulable phosphor sheet 1 from which the sample generally has been removed, the stimulable phosphor sheet is hereinafter referred to as phosphor sheet , and a final read out section 3 for finally reading out the desired locational information on the radioactively labeled substance stored in the phosphor sheet 1. In the preliminary read out section 2, the preliminary read out operation is carried out in the following manner. Laser beam 5 generated by a laser source 4 first pusses through a filter 6 to cut off a light beam in the wavelength region corresponding to the wavelength region of stimulated emission to be emitted from the phosphor sheet 1 in response to stimulation with the laser beam 5.The laser beam 5 is subsequently deflected by a beam deflecter 7 such as a galvanometer mirror, and reflected by a plane reflecting mirror 8. The deflected beam then impinges upon the phosphor sheet 1. The laser source 4 used herein is so selected as to avoid overlapping of the.wavelength region of the laser beam 5 with the main wavelength region of the stimulated emission to be emitted from the phosphor sheet 1. The phosphor sheet 1 is transferred to the direction along the arrow 9 under the irradiation of the abovementioned deflected laser beam. Therefore, the whole surface of the phosphor sheet 1 is subjected to the irradiation of the deflected laser beam. The power of the laser beam 5 employed in the preliminary read out section is adjusted to be lower than the power of the laser beam to be employed in the final read out section by controlling the output of the laser source 4, the beam diameter of the laser beam 5, the scanning speed of the laser beam 5, and the transferring speed of the phosphor sheet 1. When irradiated with the above mentioned laser beam, the phosphor sheet 1 gives the stimulated emission having the emission intensity proportional to the radiation ener a stored or recorded therein. The emission then enters into a light guiding sheet 10 for the preliminary readout. The light guiding sheet 10 has a linear edge face for receiving the emmision, and the edge face is so positioned in the vicinity of the phosphor sheet as to correspond to the scanning line on the phosphor sheet 1. The exit of the light guiding sheet 10 is in the form of a ring and is connected to an light receiving face of a light detector 11 such as a photomultiplier.The light ,guiding sheet 10 is made, for instance, by processing a sheet of a transparent thermoplastic resin such as an acrylic synthetic resin, and so constituted that the emission introduced from the linear edge face is transmitted to the exit under repeated total reflection within the sheet 10. The stimulated emission from the phosphor sheet 1 is guided in the interior of the light guiding sheet 10 to the exit, and received by the light detector 11. The preferable shape and material of the light guiding sheet is disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publications No. 55 1980 87970 and No. 56 1981 11397, etc. On the light receiving face of the light detector 11 is provided a filter which allows only the light of wave region region of the stimulated emission to pass through and cuts off the light of the wavelength region of the stimulating rays laser beam so as to detect only the stimulated emission. The stimulated emission detected by the light detector 11 is converted to an electric signal, amplified in an amplifier 12 and transmitted to the output. The stored information output from the amplifier 12 is supplied to a control circuit 13 of the final read out section 3.The control circuit 13 provides an, amplification degree setting value a, a scale factor setting value b, and an image processing condition setting value c so that a well readable image having even concentration and contrast can be obtained regardless of variation of the detected information. The phosphor sheet 1 having been subjected to the preliminary read out in the above described manner is then transferred to the final read out section 3. In the final read out section 3, the following readout operation is performed. The laser beam 15 generated by a laser source 14 for the final read out passes through a filter 16 having the saone function as that of the above mentioned filter 6, and then the beam diameter is precisely adjusted in a beam expander 17. Subsequently, the laser beam is deflected by a beam deflector 18 such as a galvanometer mirror, and reflected by a plane reflection mirror 19. The deflected beam then impinges one dimensionally upon the phosphor sheet 1. Between the beam deflector 18 and the plane reflection mirror 19 a fB lens 20 is provided so that the beam speed is continuously kept constant when the deflected laser beam is scanned on the phosphor sheet 1. The phosphor sheet 1 is transferred in the direction along the arrow 21 under the irradiation with the abovementioned deflected laser beam. Accordingly, the whole surface of the phosphor sheet is subjected to the irradiation in the same manner as in the preliminary read out operation. When irradiated with the above mentioned laser beam, the phosphor sheet 1 gives the stimulated emission in proportion to the radiation energy stored therein in the same manner as in the preliminary read out operation. The emission then enters into a light guiding sheet 22 for the final read out. The light guiding sheet 22 for the final read out is of the same material and has the same constitution as the light guiding sheet 10 employed for the preliminary read out. The stimulated emission received is guided in the interior of the light guiding sheet 22 up to the exit under repeated total reflection, and then received by a light detector 23.On the light receiving face of the light detector 23 is provided a filter which allows only the light of wavelength region of the stimulated emission to pass through and cuts off the light of the wavelength region of the stimulating rays laser beam so as to detect only the stimulated emission. The stimulated emission detected by the light detector 23 is converted to an electric signal, amplified to an electric signal adjusted to an appropriate level in an amplifier 24 according to the aforementioned amplification degree setting value a and transmitted to an A D converter 25. The adjusted electric signal is then converted to a digital signal in the A D converter 25 according to an appropriate scale facter defined by the scale factor setting value b, and supllied to a a signal processing circuit 26.In the circuit 26, the digital signal is so processed according to the image processing condition setting value c as to give a well readable visible image having well adjusted concentration and contrast, and then transmitted to a recording device not shown , optionally upon storage in a storing means such as a magnetic tape. Various recording devices based on various systems can be employed for the above described purpose, for instance, a device for visualizing optically by scanning on a lightsensitive material with laser beam, etc., a display means for visualizing electrically on CRT, etc., a means for printing a radiation image displayed on CRT by means of a video printer, and a means for visualizing on heatsensitive recording material using thermic rays. The recording device employable in the invention is not restricted to the visualizing devices such as above, and the one or two dimensional information on the location of the radioactively labeled substances in a sample may be recorded or produced, for instance, in the form of numeral and or symbol. In the above descripiton on the method for reading out the locational information on the radioactively labeled substanace copied and stored in the stimulable phosphor sheet, a read out operation involving both the preliminary read out operation and the final read out operation has been given. However., the read out operation employable in the present invention is not limited to the above des cribed embodiment. For instance, the preliminary read out operation may be omitted if the content of the radioactive substance in the sample and an adequate exposure time for the sample is previously known. Further, it is natural that other suitable methods than the above mentioned embodiments may be used for reading out the locational information on the radioactively labeled substances copied from the sample and stored in the stimulable phosphor sheet. In the present invention, the term locational information of the radioactively labeled substances means to include a variety of information relating to the location of the radioactively labeled substances, or the aggregation thereof, being present in the sample, such as the location, the shape, the concentration, the distribution combination of thereof. The determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment can be performed in the same manner as described in the base sequencing method utilizing the conventional autoradiography in which the radiographic film is employed, except that the rows of the resolved base specific cleavage products are copied onto the stimulable phosphor sheet in the form of a radiation energy image and subsequently said phosphor sheet is scanned with an electromagnetic wave to release at least a portion of radiation energy stored in said phosphor sheet as stimulated emission to detect locational information on the resolved radioactively labeled cleavage products. The determination of base sequence of the DNA or DNA fragment can be made based on said locational information detected in the above. The method for determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment utilizing the above described radiation image recording and reproducing method employing a stimulable phosphor sheet is more advantageous than the method utilizing the conventional autoradiography employing a radiographic film, because the procedure for copying the resolved rows onto the stimulable phosphor sheet can be done at an ambient temperature within a grominently shorter period of time in the former method. Moreover, in the the former method employing a stimulable phosphor sheet, the locational information on the resolved rows is obtained as digital signal. Accordingly, the digital signal can be processed in a computer to give the base sequence ofDNA or DNA fragment under analysis directly with no visualization of the autoradiograph of the resolved rows. Moreover, the noises introducted into the phosphor sheet in the course of the copying procedure can be removed through the processing to make it possible more accurate base sequencing
