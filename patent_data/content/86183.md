# Electronic external line repeater.

## Abstract
An electronic external line repeater connects a two wire side to two four wire sides. The repeater contains two optocouplers FT1 D1, FT2 D2 . A self compensating nega tive feedback circuit is connected in accordance with the invention from the two wire side to the incoming four wire side. Initial spread and age degradation in the optocoupler FT2 D2 is thus counteracted. The feedback circuit contains a lowpass filtering and comparing circuit F3 connected to the line amplifier F2 of the repeater.
