## Description
DESYNCHRONIZED INJECTION SANDWICH MOLDINGFIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to injection molding of thermoplastic materials and specifically to injection molding employing sandwich molds.DISCUSSION OF PRIOR ART Heretofore injection molding of thermoplastics using a sandwich mold has employed synchronous injection and synchronized opening and closing of the parting surfaces of the sandwich mold and therefore also ejected the molded products synchronously. The means for the synchronous opening and closing is usually a gear system. A sandwich mold operating with synchronous opening and closing usually must open twice as far as a single parting mold , which increases the cycle time of the production. A sandwich mold usually has at least twice as many cavities as a single parting mold, and therefore the injection power needed for injection of all the cavities simultaneously is at least twice as high, and may be beyond the capacity of the injection molding machine.Also, the injection volume has to be twice as large and that too, may be beyond the maximum capacity of the machine. The more cavities a mold has the more difficult it becomes to fill the individual cavities balanced and evenly. According to the present invention there is provided a method of injection molding a thermoplastic material utilizing a combination of a sandwich mold and an injection unit which together encompass a feed system with a molten core, the feed system comprising a channel system which is at least bifurcated encom passed by the injection unit and two or more runner systems encompassed by the sandwich mold, the runner systems comprising a first runner system for feeding a first cooling cavity encompassed by a first parting surface, and a second runner system for feeding a second cooling cavity encompassed by a second parting surface, the method comprising the steps of a filling the first cavity and b filling the second cavity subsequent to step a . The method of desynchronized injection is an advantage because it leaves the full injection power of the machine to fill each set of cooling cavities encompassed by a parting surface. Also the maximum injection volume of the injection molding machine may be a limiting factor, in which case only enough injection volume for a set of cooling cavities encompassed by one parting surface need to be injected at the same time. In such case, it is also easier to fill the individual cavities more balanced and evenly.The injections may be spaced equally apart in time which makes the plasticizing more efficient and homogeneous. The method of desynchronized open periods is an advantage because the cycletime may usually be shortened in relation to a traditional synchronous method of opening a sandwich mold. Also the maximum opening stroke of the clamping unit may be a limiting factor of the machine, in which case only the one parting surface need open at the time. The openings may be spaced equally in time in which case the packing operation for the molded products may be simplified such as using one robot instead of two. Preferably the first parting surface is normally opened before opening the second parting surface for ejecting the molded product whereby it is possible to adjust the cooling period for each set of cooling cavities so that they are of equal duration. It is also possible to open the second parting surface before the first parting surface whereby the cooling period for the set of cooling cavities encompassed by the first parting surface receive a longer cooling period than the set of cooling cavities encompassed by the second parting surface. This is an advantage in, for example, a case where lids and bases are produced in each their parting surface, and the bases needing for example a longer cooling period than the lids. When injection molding a thermoplastic material and employing a runner system with a molten core, the runner becomes pressurized during the injection of the material into the cooling cavities of the mold. After the injection pressure is terminated, the pressure in the molten core is usually depressurized through the injection orifice of the runner system, either due to a partial vacuum created in the injection unit or due to exposing the injection orifice to atmospheric pressure. When the runner system is long it takes longer to pressurize and to depressurize due to the compressibility and the viscosity of the molten material, the last part of the runner system to depressurize being the part furthest away from the injection orifice, which is usually at the gates to the cooling cavities. If the molten core at the gates to the cooling cavities is still pressurized when the parting line which encompasses the cooling cavity opens, to eject the molded product, some molten material will squirt onto the gate area and possibly into the cooling cavity where it will cool and therefore plug the gate for further injection. When injection molding and employing sandwich molds which operate with desynchronized injection periods and desynchronized open periods and using a single runner system for the injection the period of time from the end of injection to the opening of the mold, that is the period available for depressurization, is reduced and in some cases as short as one tenth of a second or even shorter in which case a method of depressurizing the molten core of the runner system is needed. Also, when operating with desynchronized injection periods and using a single runner system for the injection, the second injection may penetrate into the cooling cavity which was already filled at the first injection and inject an additional layer of plastic material to the produced product particularly when the product is not yet sufficiently solidified.This is especially a problem when the product has a heavy wall thickness, in which case the product will shrink and leave open space in the cooling cavity, to accept the additional layer. It is, therefore, also an object of the invention to solve these problems. When injecting desynchronously and using more than one runner system in such a way that a valve shuts off injection pressure to the set of cooling cavities which are not being filled, then the molten core of the runner which is not used for injection is not pressurized beyond the valve, whereby the period available for depressurization is not reduced and the injection of an additional layer of plastic material does not occur. The traditional method of sandwich molding uses a sandwich mold with two parting surfaces and a snorkel which encompasses a part of the runner system and transfers the hot molten thermoplastic from the nozzle of the injection unit to the middle part of the sandwich mold, which is positioned between the two parting surfaces. The snorkel is positioned so that the central axis of the snorkel is identical to the central horizontal axis of the clamping platens of the injection molding machine. It may, in certain circumstances, not be expedient to bring the material into the sandwich mold along the central axis of the clamping platens. Earlier solutions to the problem are described in U.S. Patent 3,66,145 to Teraoka entitled SYNTHETIC RESIN INJECTION MOLDINGAPPARATUS U.S. Patent 3,669,601 to Lainesse entitled APPARATUS FOR INJECTION MOLDING and U.S. Patents 3,659,997 3,723,040 and 3,973,892 to Rees entitledINJECTION MOLDING MACHINE WITH TRANSVERSE FEED. All the above mentioned prior art solutions basically deals with transporting the molten material to the top of the mold where it is injected into the mold. The problem with such solutions is that a certain amount of hot molten plastic is bound to drool out at the point where the material leaves the injection unit and enters the mold. Some of this material may drop down and get caught between the parting furfaces, causing production stops and or damaged molds. Another problem with such solution is that it is very difficult to adapt a standard horizontally operating injection molding machine for injection into the top of a sandwich mold. Therefore, according to another aspect of the invention there is provided a system for injection molding a thermoplastic material comprising a sandwich mold, an injection unit, a feed system encompassed by the sandwich mold and the injection unit in combination the feed system comprising a channel system divided into at least two branches encompassed by the injection unit and two or more runner systems encompassed by the sandwich mold, the runner systems comprising a first runner system for feeding a first cooling cavity encompassed by a first parting surface, and a second runner system for feeding a second cooling cavity encompassed by a second parting surface, and means for filling the second cavity subsequent to filling the first cavity. One example where it is expedient not to bring the material into the sandwich mold along the central axis of the clamping platens is when all the cooling cavities of the sandwich mold are placed substantially on the central axis of the clamping platens. Another example is when more than one runner system is needed, since both runner systems cannot both be placed on the central axis of the clamping platens. When a runner has more than two parting surfaces, more than one runner system is needed. It is quite easy to adapt a standard horizontally operating injection molding machine to the method of the invention. A hole may be made in the stationary clamping platen for each snorkel of the invention, or the snorkel may be placed outside the frame of the stationary clamping platen. The nozzle of a standard horizontally operated injection molding machine is located on the central axis of the clamping platens, but in order to adapt to the invention, either a special nozzle displacer may be used, as is depicted in the drawings of the preferred embodiments, or the injection unit may be displaced for example in a vertical direction, which is a minor change to the machine. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGURE 1 refers to a first preferred embodiment of the invention and is a schematic diagram showing a partial top view of an injection molding machine and sandwich mold of the invention, the sandwich mold comprises two parting surfaces and two displaced snorkels.

FIGURES 3 and 4 are chronological breakdowns into separate functions of the operation of injection molding cycles in accordance with embodiments of the invention.FIRST PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIGURE 1 relates to a first preferred embodiment of the invention and shows a partial view of a clamping unit comprising a stationary clamping platen 10 and a movable clamping platen 11 with a central axis 13.Also shown is a partial view of an injection unit 14 comprising a first nozzle 40 and a second nozzle 41, the second nozzle 41 comprises a valve 42 which controls the flow of hot molten plastic from the injection unit 14. Held between the clamping platens 10, 11 is a sandwich mold 17 with a left mold part 24, a middle mold part 25 and a right mold part 26. Separating the left mold part 24 from the middle mold part 25 is a left parting surface 18, and separating the middle mold part 25 from the right mold part 26 is a right parting surface 19. Encompassed by the left parting surface 18 is a left cooling cavity 20, and encompassed by the right parting surface 19 is a right cooling cavity 21.Also shown is a left molded product 22 enclosed in the left cooling cavity 20 and a right molded product 23 being ejected from the right cooling cavity 21.Connected to the middle mold part is a first snorkel 30 which encompasses a part of a first fluid runner system 43, the rest of the first fluid runner system 43 is encompassed by the middle mold part 25. Also connected to the middle mold part is a second snorkel 31 which encompasses a part of a second fluid runner system 44 the rest of the second fluid runner system 44 is encompassed by the middle mold part 25. The first snorkel 30 comprises the first runner orifice 45, and the snorkel projects from the middle mold part 25 with its orifice 45 toward the first nozzle 40. Likewise the second snorkel 31 comprises a second runner orifice 46, and the snorkel 31 projects from the middle mold part 25 with its orifice 46 toward the second nozzle 41. Each snorkel 30, 31 has a central axis 33 which is parallel to, positioned displaced from, and with the same elevation as the central axis 13 of the clamping platens 10, 11. Both nozzles 40, 41 are located outside the space which is encompassed by the extended planes of the parting surfaces 18, 19.Both cooling cavities 20, 21 are placed on the central axis 13 of the clamping platens 10, 11. Both snorkels 30, 31 are significantly displaced from the central axis 13 of the clamping platens 10, 11 in order to laterally bypass the left cooling cavity 21. Each runner system 43, 44 feeds only such cooling cavities 20, 21 as are encompassed by one parting surface 18, 19.OPERATION OF THE FIRST PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIGURE 3 relates to the operation of the first preferred embodiment of the invention and shows the sequence of steps during a production cycle. The upper line of events relates to the right cooling cavity 21 and the lower line of events relates to the left cooling cavity 20. The symbols I, C, O, E, S and W stand for the periods of injection cooling, opening, ejecting, shutting and waiting, respectively. The movable clamping platen 11 is moved toward the stationary clamping platen 10, along their central axis 13, whereby bothpartingsurfaces 18, 19 are shut.The injection unit 14 is moved toward the stationary clamping platen 10 whereby the nozzles 40, 41 both seal with the runner orifices 45, 46 respectively.Hot molten plastic is injected from the injection unit 14. The valve 42 is shut. Therefore, the material flows via the nozzle displacer 15, the first nozzle 40, the first snorkel 30 and the first runner system 43 to the right cooling cavity 21 filling the cavity.Meanwhile, the left cooling cavity 22 is in a waiting position. Then the valve 42 is opened and hot molten plastic flows via the nozzle displacer 15, the second nozzle 41, the second snorkel 31 and the second runner system 44 to the left cooling cavity 20 filling the cavity. Meanwhile the right cooling cavity 21 has started its cooling phase, and after the filling of the left cooling cavity 20, the cavity 20 also starts its cooling phase, and the two molded products 22, 23 are created. Then the movable clamping platen 11 is moved away from the stationary clamping platen 10 along the central axis 13. The left parting surface 18 is kept shut by hydraulic means, not shown, whereby only the right parting surface 19 is opened and the right molded product 23 is ejected. Meanwhile the left cooling cavity 20 is finishing its cooling phase. The middle mold part 25 is moved in a right direction by the hydraulic means, not shown, so that the left parting surface 18 is opened and the right parting surface 19 is shut and the left molded product 22 is ejected.The movable clamping platen 11 is moved toward the stationary clamping platen 10 whereby the left parting surface 18 is also shut, meanwhile the right cooling cavity 21 is in a waiting position. The shut period of the left parting surface 18 overlaps the shut period of the second parting surface 19, and the filling of both cavities 20, 21 occurs during the overlapping period. The open period of the left parting surface 18 is desynchronized from the open period of the right parting surface 19.SECOND PREFERRED EMBODIMENT A second preferred embodiment is illustrated in Figures 2A, 2B and Figure 4. FIGURE 2A and 2B shows partial views of an injection molding machine with a stacked sandwich mold, or in other words a sandwich mold with four parting surfaces 102, 103, 104 and 105. The injection molding machine comprises an injection unit 108, with an upper nozzle 109 and a lower nozzle 110, with nozzle tips 111 and 112 respectively and a channel system 113 with a molten core. The injection molding machine further comprises a clamping unit with a stationary platen 106 and a moving platen 107 connected by tie bars, not shown. The sandwich mold has a first left part 123, a second middle part 124, and a second right part 125. The first right part 122 is fastened to the second left part 123 to make a center unit 130.A first left parting surface 102 separates first left part 120 and first middle part 121, and a first right parting surface 103 separates first middle part 121 and first right part 122. A second left parting surface 104 separates second left part 123 and a second middle part 124, and a second right parting surface 105 separates second middle part 124 and second right part 125. Encompassed by the two first parting surfaces 102 and 103 are first cooling cavities 126, and encompassed by the two second parting surfaces 104 and 105 are second cooling cavities 127. Also shown are molded products 128 and 129. First left, middle and right mold parts 120, 121 and 122 are connected by a conventional steering system for sandwich molds, not shown, which synchronize opening and closing of first parting surfaces 102 and 103. Likewise, second left, middle and right mold parts 123, 124 and 125 are connected by a conventional steering system for sandwich molds, not shown, which synchronizes opening and closing of second parting surfaces 104 and 105.Two sets of electromagnets, not shown, alternately attach the center unit 130 to stationary platen 106 or moving platen 107, every time the moving platen 107 opens in relation to the stationary platen 106. Instead of electromagnetic steering, the center unit 130 may be steered by hydraulic cylinders attached to stationary platen 106 or moving platen 107. Many other system for alternately attaching the center unit 130 to the stationary platen 106 or the moving platen 107 are possible. The two middle mold parts 121 and 124 and injection unit 108 in combination encompass a bifurcated feed system 113 for transporting molten material from the injection unit 108 to the cooling cavities 126 and 127 respectively through the gates 131.The bifurcated feed system 113 comprises a stem 132 located in the channel system 113 of the injection unit 108 and two branches, an upper branch and a lower branch, located partly in the injection unit 108 and partly in the two middle parts 121 and 124 of the sandwich mold. An upper snorkel 133 encompasses a part of the upper branch and stretches between the upper nozzle tip 111 and the first middle mold part 121, a lower snorkel 134 encompasses a part of the lower branch and stretches between the lower nozzle tip 112 and the second middle mold part 124. The upper snorkel 133 contains the upper injection orifice 135 of an upper runner system 137 and the lower snorkel 134 contains the lower injection orifice 136 of a lower runner system 138. During injection the upper nozzle tip 111 forms a seal with the upper injection orifice 135 and the lower nozzle tip 112 forms a seal with the lower injection orifice 136. The upper branch of the feed system which is situated in the injection unit 108 comprises a valve 139 for controlling the feeding of material to the first cavities 126 and the lower branch of the feed system which is situated in the injection unit 108 comprises a valve 140 for controlling the feeding of material to the second cavities 127.OPERATION OF THE SECOND PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIGURE 4 shows a chronological breakdown into separate functions of the operation of the embodiment and shows the order of events in a desychronized cycle of injection molding with two parting surfacesInjection I, Cooling C, Opening O, Extended position E, and Shutting S. The upper line of events is for the first set of parting surfaces and the lower line of events is for the second set of parting surfaces. The cycle has desynchronized injection periods and desynchronized opening, extended position and closing periods, also the cooling periods are desynchronized. All parting surfaces 102, 103, 104 and 105 are shut and under clamping pressure. The injection unit 108 is pressurized with the lower valve 140 shut and the upper valve 139 open whereby the first cooling cavities 126 are filled. Shortly after the injection period for the first cooling cavities 126 has ended the lower valve 140 is also opened so that the whole feed system may be depressurized through the two injection orifices 135 and 136. It should here be noted, as will be further explained later, that the lower runner system 138 was at least partly depressurized earlier in the previous cycle. While the first cooling cavities 126 are being filled there will not be injected an additional layer of material into the second cooling cavities 127 which was filled in the previous cycle, since the lower valve 140 was shut at that time. When the cooling period for the second cooling cavities 127 has terminated, the second parting surfaces 104 and 105 opens, eject the molded product 129 during its extended period, and shuts during all this time both valves 139 and 140 are open and both the runner systems 137 and 138 will depressurize through the injection orifices 135 and 136. Then the injection unit 108 is again pressurized with now the upper valve 139 shut, and the lower valve 140 open whereby the second cooling cavities 127 are filled. Shortly after the injection period for the second cooling cavities 127 have terminated the upper valve 139 is opened so that both runner systems 137 and 138 may depressurize through the two injection orifices 135 and 136. It should be noted that the upper runner system 137 was at least partly depressurized earlier in the cycle. While the second cooling cavities 127 are being filled there will not be injected an additional layer of material into the first cooling cavities 126 which were filled earlier in the cycle, since the upper valve 139 was shut at that time. When the cooling period for the first cooling cavities 126 has ended, the first parting surfaces 102 and 103 open, ejects the molded products 128 during their extended period and shut during all this time both valves 139 and 140 are open, and the runner systems 137 and 138 will depressurize through the injection orifices 135 and 136. The lower runner system 138 will stay at least partly depressurized into the next cycle.During each cycle the moving platen 107 opens twice in relation to the stationary platen 106, each of the parting surfaces 102, 103, 104 and 105 opens once during each cycle and the center mold unit 130 is alternately steered to attach to the stationary platen 106 or the moving platen 107. It is also possible to operate the system shown in Figure 1 with the cycle shown in figure 4 and to operate the system shown in figure 2 with the cycle shown in figure 3. In the later case the shut period of the first pair of parting surfaces overlaps the shut period of the second pair of parting surfaces, and the filling of the cooling cavies encompassed by both pairs of parting surfaces occur during said overlapping period. While the above description contains many preferred features these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of two preferred embodiments thereof. Many other variations within the scope of the appended claims are possible, for example One or more valve s of the bifurcated feed system may be positioned in the channel system of the injection unit and or in the runner system of the sandwich mold or at both locations. There may be many parting surfaces, opening in various synchronous or desynchronous relations to each other, and many valves placed in various places in the feed system which may have many branches and or stems. The axis of the injection unit may be vertical or horizontal and or at right angles to the axis of the clamping unit. The individual injection periods, opening periods, extended periods or points in time, and closing periods of the different ejection ports may vary from those of the other ejection ports and a total production cycle may be constructed to optimize the various obtainable advantages. There may be various numbers of snorkels, parting surfaces and cooling cavities used in combination with various production cycles. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined not by the embodiment illustrated, but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents.Although the term bifurcated has been used in this specification this is to be interpreted in its broadest sense to embrace two or more branches.
