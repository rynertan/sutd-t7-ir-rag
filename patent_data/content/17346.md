# Multi purpose optical data processor.

## Abstract
A multi purpose optical data processor has shared optics 30 for selectively performing light lens xerographic copying in accordance with a line by line scanning pattern and laser reading and writing in accordance with a raster scanning pattern. Among the laser reading and writing functions which such an optical data processor can perform are laser input scanning and laser xerographic printing, and laser photographic and thermographic recording.
