# PROCEDURE AND PREFABRICATED MODULAR ELEMENTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF PARTITION AND CURTAIN WALLS FOR USE INSIDE BUILDINGS

## Abstract
A prefabricated modular element for constructing parti tions and curtain walls, for use inside buildings formed by two brick layers 1a, 1b connected and spaced apart by plaster septa 2 , the last material also forming the outer coating 6 of said layers. The septa 2a, 2b are shaped and arranged so as to form complementary members 7, 8 for fixed joint con nection of the modular elements to each other. The spacing of the septa is designed so as to allow laying the electrical cables and or water mains and similar services. The use of said pre fabricated modular elements results in easier and more eco nomical procedure for the erection of double walls with respect to known techniques.
