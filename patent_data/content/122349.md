# A process for producing aluminium hydroxycarbonate gel.

## Abstract
A process for the continuous production of aluminium hydroxycarbonate gel is disclosed, in which aluminium salt solution is continuously reacted with mixed alkaline carbo nate and bicarbonate solution under homogeneous condi tions in a relatively small reaction vessel. The reaction is continued in a subsequent reaction vessel under controlled pH. The product gel is separated from the non aluminium cation containing reaction mixture within less than about 6 hours, whereby formation of poorly soluble addition reaction products such as dihydroxy aluminium sodium carbonate, which contribute undesired non alumium cations to the gel product, is reduced. The aluminium salt solution is adjusted in pH by adding to it a portion of the mixed carbonate and bicarbonate solution to obtain a clear solution of pH 3.5 to 4.0. This results in a smooth, creamy gel with a less objectionable chalky mouth feel.
