## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Motor vehicle wheel, characterisedin that it has a substantially planar outer face 3 with a central recessed part 4 which is defined peripherally by a wall 6 with ventilation apertures 7 communicating with the interior of the wheel 1 . 2. Wheel according to Claim 1, characterised in that it includes a member la fitted removably in the manner of a hub cap, said removable member la defining the outer face 3 of the wheel 1 . 3. Wheel according to Claim 2, characterised in that the member la is fitted by snap engagement. 4. Wheel according to Claim 1, characterised in that the recessed central part 4 has sockets 8 having through holes 9 in their base walls for fixing bolts stud bolts of the wheel 1 . 5. Wheel according to Claim 1, particularly for tyred wheels, characterised in that the rim 10 of the outer face 3 extends to the region corresponding to the edge of the rim of the wheel 1 , whereby the junction of the outer face 3 with the outer wall of the tyre P is substantially without discontinuity. 6.

## Description
Motor vehicle wheel, particularly for motor cars The present invention relates to motor vehicle wheels. The wheel according to the invention is characterised in that it has a substantially planar outer face with a central recessed part which is defined peripherally by a wall with ventilation apertures communicating with the interior of the wheel. By virtue of this characteristic, a motor vehicle wheel is formed with a shape which, in addition to improving the aerodynamic efficiency of the vehicle, ensures efficient ventilation of the devices, particularly the brake members, located within the wheel. To advantage, the wheel according to the invention includes a member applied removably in the manner of a hub cap, the removable member defining the said outer face of the wheel. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will emerge from the following description, given purely by way of non limiting example, with reference to the appended drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevational view of a wheel according to the invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of the outer face of the wheel of Figure 1, illustrated after the fitting of a tyre thereon, and Figure 3 is a view taken on arrow III of Figure 1, showing a part of a wheel according to the invention. In the drawings, a wheel, generally indicated 1, is intended for assembly on a motor vehicle not illustrated after a type P, illustrated only inFigure 2, has been fitted to the wheel itself. The wheel 1 includes a disc 2 having a face 3 which, in the assembled position of the wheel 1, faces outwardly of the motor vehicle. In the present description and in the claims which follow, the face 3 will therefore be referred to simply as the outer face the wheel 1. The face 3 is generally planar with a slight convexity, and has a central recessed part 4. The periphery of the recessed part 4 is defined by a cylindrical or conical wall 6 with a ring of apertures 7 communicating with the interior of the wheel. The apertures 7 thus allow efficient ventilation of the devices, such as the braking devices, located within the wheel 1. The central recessed part 4 of the face 3 is provided with four sockets 8 each of which has a through hole 8 in its base wall for a respective bolt stud bolt for fixing the wheel 1 to one of the hubs of the motor vehicle. The rim 10 of the outer face 3 extends to the region corresponding to the edge of the wheel rim, that is to say, into correspondence with the outer bead of the tyre P. Thus, the junction between the peripheral part of the face 3 and the wall of the tyreP is essentially without discontinuity. This, together with the generally planar conformation of the face 3 itself, considerably improves the aerodynamic ef ficiency of the vehicle on which the wheel according to the invention is mounted. In order to render the inflating valve for the tyre P the valve schematically indicated V in Figure 2 accessible from the exterior, the periphery of the face 3 has an aperture 11. The wheel 1 may be formed in one piece by diecasting or centrifugal casting in a material such as a light alloy or plastics in this case, the face 3 constitutes the outer face of the integral piece. Alternatively, as illustrated in Figure 3, the outer face 3 of the wheel 1 may be a face of a discshaped metal or moulded plastics plate la fitted removably to the rest of the wheel 1, for example, by snap engagement with the outer rim of the wheel or by using the bolts which fix the wheel itself to the hub, that is to say, in the manner currently used for fitting wheel hub caps.
