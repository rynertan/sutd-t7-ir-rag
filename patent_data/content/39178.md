# Integrated circuit for generating a reference voltage.

## Abstract
A circuit for generating a reference voltage comprises first and second transistors Q₁, Q₂ with their bases con nected together, the emitter area of the first transistor being smaller than the emitter area of the second transistor. The emitter of the first transistor is connected to ground, and the emitter of the second transistor is connected to the ground via a first resistor R₁ . A current mirror circuit 1 supplies equal currents to the collectors of the first and second transistors. A feedback amplifier 2
