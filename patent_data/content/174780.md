## Description
A CRYSTALLINE METALLOSILICATE. THE SYNTHESIS THEREOF AND ITS USE IN ORGANIC CONVERSION This invention relates to a crystalline metallosilicate, the synthesis thereof and its use in organic conversion. Zeolibc materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversion. Certain zeolite materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a definite crystalline structure as determined by X ray diffraction, within which there are a large number of small cavities which are interconnected by a number of stIll smaller channels or pores. These cavities and pores are uniform in size within a specific zeolitic material. Since the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept for absorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as molecular sieves and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetIc, include a wide variety of positive ion containing crystalline aluminosilicates. These aluminosilicates can be described as a rigid three dimensional framework of SiO, and AIO. in which the tetrahedra are cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1 2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing aluminum is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio of aluminum to the number of various cations, such as Cat2, Sr 2, Na, K or Li, is equal to unity.One type of cation may be exchanged either entirely or partially with another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. By means of such cation exchange. it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosilicate by suitable selection of the cation.The spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration. Prior art techniques have resuited in the formation of a great variety of synthetic zeolites. The zeolites have come to be designated by letter or other convenient symbols. as illustrated by zeolite A U. S. Patent 2,882,243 , zeolite X U. S. Patent 2,882,244 , zeolite Y U. S. Patent 3,130,007 , zeolite ZK 5 U.S. Patent 3.247,195 , zeoliteZK 4 U. S. Patent 3,314,752 , zeolite ZSM 5 U. S. Patent 3,702,886 , zeolite ZSM 11 U. S. Patent 3,709,979 , zeolite ZSM 12 U. S.

The SiO2iAl7O, mole ratio of a given aluminosilicate zeolite is often variable. For example, zeolite X can be synthesized with SiO, AI,03 ratios of from 2 to 3 zeoliteY, from 3 to about 6. In some zeolites, the upper limit of the SiO, AIz03 ratio is unbounded. ZSM 5 is one such example wherein the SiO, Al,O, ratio is at least 5 and up to infinity. U. S. Patent 3.941,871 Re. 29,948 discloses a porous crystalline silicate made from a reaction mixture containing no deliberately added alumina and exhibiting theX ray diffraction pattern characteristic of ZSM 5 type zeolites. U. S.Patents 4,061,724, 4,073,865 and 4,104,294 describe crystalline silicates or organosilicates of varying alumina and metal content. A number of synthetic zeolites have been prepared which may be said to be isostructural with naturally occurring zeolites. Zeolites ZSM 35 and ZSM 38 are, for instance, fenierite type zeolites. Zeolite ZK 20 U.S. Patent 3,459,676 is described as being isostructurai with the naturally occurring zeolite levynite. Although the term zeolites has sometimes been used to define materials containing silica and alumina, it is recognized that the silica and alumina portions may be replaced in whole or in part with other oxides. More partcularly, GeO, is an art recognized substitute for SiO, and B,O, is an art recognized replacement for Awl,03. Accordingly, the term zeolite is used herein to connote not only materials containing silicon and, optionally, aluminum atoms in the crystalline lattice structure thereof, but also materials which contain suitable replacement atoms for such silicon and or aluminum. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a synthetic porous crystalline metallosiiicate zeolite having a silica to metal oxide molar ratio of from 5 to 500.wherein said metal is aluminum or boron and said porous crystalline material in the uncalcined state is characterized by an x ray diffraction pattem having values substantially as set forth in Table 1 of the specification. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preparing the above mentioned synthetic porous crystalline metallosilicate zeolite which comprises preparing a mixture containing sources of alkali metal ions, an oxide of aluminum or boron, an oxide of silicon, a 2 hydroxyalkyl triall ylammonium cation and water and maintaining said reaction mixture under conditions such that said crystalline material is fonned. According to yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for effecting catalytic conversion of sn organic charge which comprises contacting said charge under catalytic conversion conditions with a catalyst comprising a synthetic porous crystalline metallosilicate zeolite material according to said one aspect of the invention. The metallosilicate zeolite of the present invention may be considered to be a aluminum or boron containing counterpart of the substantially aluminum free zeolites described in U.S. Patent No. 4,376,757. In its as synthesized form, the metallosilicate zeolite of the present invention may have at least 0.5, more preferably at least 0.8, moles of 2 hydrckyalkyl trialkylammonium directing agent per mole of aluminum. The term directing agent , as used herein, connotes a compound which Is added to the crystallization mixture used to form the zeolite in order to influence the formation of the ultimately formed crystal lattice. At least a portion of the cations conesponding to the directing agent are bound to anionic sites of the crystal lattice in the as synthesized form of the zeolite. The catalytically active metallosilicate zeolite described herein, prior to calcination, has an X ray diffraction pattem which essentially conesponds to Table I as set forth in U.S.Patent No. 4,376,757. This Table I sets forth the following observable major peaks TABLE I Inte rep lunar Spacing d A RelativeObserved Intensity 10.90 VS 7.02 W 5.09 W 4.32 MS 4.17 W 3.97 N 3.66 M 3.53 VS 3.35 MS 3.32 MS 3.23 M 2.88 W 2.78 VW 2.62 W 1.97 W 1.88 W 1.85 W These values were determined by standard X ray diffraction powder techniques. The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper. and a scintillation counter spectrometer with a strip chart pen recorder was used. The peak heights,I, and the positions as a function of 2 , where is the Bragg angle. were read from the spectrometer chart.From these, the relative intensities 100 Ilo. where I,is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d obs. , the interplariar spacing in A corresponding to the recorded lines, were calcuated. In Table I the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols as follows VW very weak less than 10 , W weak 10 19 , M medium 20 39 , MS medium strong 40 70 and VS very strong greater than 70 . lon exchange of the original cations wrth other cations reveals substantially the same pattem with some minor shifts in Interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity.Other minor variations can occur depending on the metal to silicon ratio of the particuiar sample and on whether it had been subjected to thermal treatment. A major change in the X ray diffraction pattern is.however, observed when the as synthesized form of the aluminosilicate zeolite is calcined to remove the organic directing agent Such calcination may involve heating at temperatures of about 538 C 1000 F for about 16 hours.More particularly, Table II shows X ray diffraction data for an as synthesized form of an aluminosilicate zeolite in accordance with the present invention.TABLE II LINE NUMBER 2THETA D A I IMAX 1 8.11 10.91 100 2 12.58 7.04 4 3 13.48 6.57 2 4 14.07 6.29 3 5 14.40 6.15 1 6 14.80 5.99 1 7 16.26 5.45 1 8 16.98 5.22 2 9 17.09 5.19 2 10 17.46 5.08 9 11 17.84 4.97 2 12 18.21 4.87 1 13 20.63 4.31 19 14 21.24 4.18 4 15 22.13 4.02 1 16 22.44 3.96 3 17 22.81 3.90 82 18 23.92 3.72 3 19 24.33 3.66 9 20 24.51 3.63 8 21 25.11 3.55 17 22 25.34 3.51 20 23 26.69 3.34 7 24 26.95 3.31 12 25 27.70 3.22 7 26 31.03 2.882 1 27 32.29 2.772 1 28 34.22 2.621 1 29 35.44 2.533 1 30 35.96 2.498 1 31 38.28 2.351 1 32 42.08 2.147 1 33 44.73 2.026 1 34 46.04 1.971 3 35 48.32 1.884 1 36 49.13 1.854 1 37 51.73 1.767 1 38 56.25 1.635 1However, after calcination and conversion to the hydrogen form, the aluminosilicate zeolite shows the x ray diffraction data as set forth in Table Ill.TABLE Ill LINE NUMBER 2THETA D A I IMAX 1 9.49 9.32 100 2 12.80 6.92 21 3 12.86 6.88 26 4 13.51 6.55 2 5 14.35 6.17 4 6 15.88 5.58 2 7 18.13 4.89 1 8 19.13 4.64 3 9 19.77 4.49 7 10 20.21 4.39 6 11 21.41 4.15 5 12 22.70 3.92 8 13 23.12 3.85 8 14 24.10 3.69 6 15 25.63 3.48 13 16 25.94 3.44 17 17 26.75 3.33 12 18 27.33 3.26 6 19 7.70 3.22 2 20 28.82 3.10 2 21 29.83 2.996 1 22 31.62 2.830 1 23 32.40 2.763 1 24 34.80 2.578 1 25 49.47 1.842 1Similarly, a major change in the x ray diffraction pattern is observed when the as synthesized form of the borosilicate zeolite is calcined to remove the organic directing agentMore particularly, Table IV shows x ray diffraction data for an as synthesized form of a borosilicate zeolite in accordance with the present invention.TABLE IV LINE NUMBER 2THETA D A 1 IMAM 1 8.16 10.84 100 2 12.64 7.00 14 3 13.42 6.60 5 4 13.60 6.51 6 5 13.90 6.37 4 6 14.19 6.24 4 7 14.38 6.16 3 8 17.58 5.05 15 9 18.44 4.81 2 10 20.75 4.28 45 11 22.57 3.94 14 12 22.83 3.90 7 13 24.37 3.65 22 14 24.68 3.61 9 15 25.22 3.53 51 16 25.45 3.50 54 17 26.82 3.32 20 18 27.05 3.30 33 19 27.81 3.21 21 20 28.88 3.09 1 21 30.44 2.937 1 22 31.11 2.875 4 23 32.41 2.762 2 24 34.33 2.612 4 25 35.55 2.525 1 26 36.13 2.486 2 27 37.50 2.398 1 28 38.47 2.340 1 29 40.60 2.222 1 30 42.21 2.141 3 31 45.00 2.015 1 32 46.24 1.963 6 33 46.75 1.943 1 34 47.19 1.926 2 35 48.56 1.875 4 36 49.19 1.852 4 37 49.96 1.825 1 38 52.27 1 750 1 39 56.12 1.639 1 40 56.60 1.626 1 After ralcination and conversion to the hydrogen form, the borosilicate zeolite exhibits the x ray diffraction data set out in Table V.TABLE V LINE NUMBER 2THETA D A 1 IMAM 1 9.73 9.09 100 2 12.86 6.88 74 3 14.38 6.16 9 4 16.10 5.51 7 5 18.25 4.86 3 6 19.20 4.62 5 7 19.97 4.45 12 8 20.54 4.32 4 9 21.62 4.11 13 10 22.91 3.88 16 11 23.23 3.83 16 12 24.10 3.69 10 13 25.88 3.44 42 14 26.85 3.32 16 15 27.54 3.24 11 16 28.89 3.09 1 17 36.90 2.436 1 18 44.30 2.045 1 19 46.50 1.953 1 20 49.38 1.846 2 21 50.42 1.810 1 The metallosilicate zeolite of the present invention sorbs significant amounts of commonly used test adsorbate materials, i.e. cyclohexane, n hexane and water. For exampie, an aluminosilicate zeolite of the present invention has been observed to sorb 1.6 weight percent cyclohexane and 1.2 weight percent n hexane, wherein cyclohexane and n hexane sorption are measured at 20 Ton. The zeolite of the present invention can be used either in the alkali metal form, e.g. the sodium or potassium form the ammonium form the hydrogen form or another univalent or mulbvalent cationic form. When used as a catalyst the zeolite may be subjected to thermal treatment to remove part or all of the organic constituent The onginal alkali metal cations of the as synthesized zeolite can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art, at least In part, by ion exchange with other cations. Preferred replacing cations include metal ions, hydrogen ions, hydrogen precursor, e.g. ammonium, ions and mixtures thereof. Particulariy preferred cations are those which render the zeolite catalytically active, especially for hydrocarbon conversion.Replacing cations indude hydrogen, rare earth metals and metals of Groups IA, lIA, lIlA, IVA, IB, lIB, IlIB, IVB and VIII of the Periodic Table of theElements. A typical ion exchange technique would be to contact the synthetic metallosiiicate zeolite with a salt of the desired replacing cation or canons. Examples of such salts include the halides, .g. chlondes, nitrates and sulfates. For exan,ple, the zeolite can be used as a catalyst in intimate combination with a hydrogenating component such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal such as platinum or palladium where a hydrogenation dehydrogenation function Is to be performed. Such component can be exchanged Into the composition to the extent atom, aluminum, IS In the structure, impregnated therein or intimately physically admixed therewIth. Such component can be impregnated in or on to it such as for example, by, in the case of platinum, treating the zeolite with a solution containing a platinum metal containing ion.Thus, suitable platinum compounds include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinum amine complex. The zeolite, especially in its metal, hydrogen and ammonium forms can be beneficially converted to another form by thennal treatment This thermal treatment is generally performed by heating one of these forms at a temperature of at least 370 C for at least 1 minute and generally not longer than 20 hours. While subatmospheric pressure can be employed for the thermal treatment atmospheric pressure is desired for reasons of convenience. The thermal treatment can be performed at a temperature up to about 925 C. The new zeolite, when employed either as an adsorbent or as a catalyst in an organic compound conversion process should be dehydrated, at least partially. This can be done by heating to a temperature in the range of 2000C to 595 C in an inert atmosphere, such as air, nitrogen. etc. and at atmospheric, subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressures for between 30 minutes and 48 hours. Dehydration can also be performed at room temperature merely by placing the alumnosilicats zeolite in a vacuum, but a longer time is required to obtain a sufficient amount of dehydration. The zeolite can be prepared from a reaction mixture containing sources of alkali metal ions Z , an oxide of aluminum or boron, an oxide of silica, water and an organic cation R , wherein R is a 2 hydroxyalkyl trialkylammonium cation wherein alkyl is composed of of one or two carbon atoms. The reaction mixture may compnse an appropriate selection of reactants, having a composition, in terms of mole ratios, falling within the following ranges Reactants Useful Preferred Si02 A1203 or B203 10 1000 20 250OH SiO2 0.1 0.8 0.2 0.6H2O OH 20 100 20 60R R Z 0.1 0.8 0.2 0.6K K Na 0.2 1.0 0.2 0.7 wherein R and Z are as above defined. The alumina sources useful herein exhibit a limited degree and rate of solubility in either water or caustic solution. This is conveniently measured as degree of solubility , which is the weight percent of aluminum ions provided to the subject solution at particular conditions of temperature and time by the subject source of aluminaDegree of solubility of said alumina source is preferably less than about 20 weight percent preferably less than about 5 weight percent in water solution determined by the following solubility test Five grams of alumina source 100 solid basis are mixed and slunied with 100 grams of distilled water. The slurried mixture is heated to 1000C and maintained at this temperature for 24 hours.The mixture is then filtered while at about 100 C. Degree of solubility is then determined by analyzing the filtrate for aluminium ion content and drying and weighing the filtered material. Degree of solubility of said alumina source is preferably less than about 90 weight percent, preferably less than about 50 weight percent, in caustic solution determined by the following solubility test Five grams of alumina source 100 solid basis are mixed and slurred with 100 grams of 5 weight percent sodium hydroxide solution 5 grams of anhydrous sodium hydroxide dissolved in 95 grams of distilled water . The slumped mixture is heated to 1000C and maintained at Bis temperature for 24 hours. The mixture is then filtered while at about 1000C. Degree of solubility is then determined by analyzing the filtrate for aluminum ion content and drying and weighing the filtered material. For either caustic or water solution, Degree of Solubility x 5 Remaining Undisso1ved x 100. grams 5 Commonly used sources of alumina for zeolite synthesis, such as, for example, sodium aluminate or aluminum sulfate, exhibit degrees of solubility by either of the above solubility tests of 100 weight percent In fact both sodium aluminate and aluminum sulfate are essentially instantaneously 100 weight percent soluble in distilled water at room temperature. Alumina sources found to satisfy the above solubility limitations include the high temperature transition aluminas, such as, for example, kappa, theta, iota and the two delta forms of alumina transition aluminas, such as, for example, gamma, eta and chi forms of alumina and the tri and monohydrated aluminas which are not predigested or reacted with alkaline earth or alkali metal hydroxide, strong mineral acids, e.g. hydrogen fluoride.Such hydrated aluminas useful herein include the trihydrates known as gibbsite, bayerite and nordstrandite, and the monohydrates known as boehmite and diaspora The boron source useful in making the borosilicate of the present invention is preferably boric acid which may be considered as a hydrated form of B,01, particularly in view of the equation B,O, 3H.O 2H,BOI. Crystallization of the new aluminosilicate zeolite can be carried out at either static or stirred conditions in a suitable reactor vessel, such as for example, poiypropylene jars or teflon lined or stainless steel autoclaves. A useful range of temperatures for crystallization is from 600C to 3500C for a time of 12 hours to 200 days. The pH may be from 7 to 14.0. Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered. The composition can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxides. Such compositions may include sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid, sodium hydroxide, a source of aluminum, and an appropriate organic compound. It should be realized that the reaction mixture component oxides can be supplied from more than one source.The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously. Crystal size and crystallization time of the new crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite will vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed and the crystallization conditions. In all cases, synthesis of the present metallosilicate crystals is facilitated by the presence of at least 0.01 percent, preferably 0.10 percent and still more preferably 1 percent, seed crystals based on total weight of crystalline product The 2 hydroxyalkyl trialkylammonium directing agent may be the hydroxide or halide, e.g. chloride, iodide or bromide. Preferably, the compound is 2 v1ydnoxyethyl trimethylammonium chloride, normally called chol,ne chloride. The crystals prepared by the instant invention can be shaped into a wide variety of particle forms. Generally speaking, the particles can be in the form of a powder, a granule, or a molded product, such as an extrudate having particle size sufficient to pass through a 2 mesh Tyler screen and be retained on a 400 mesh Tyier screen. In cases where the catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion, the crystals can be extruded before drying or partially dried and then extruded. In the case of many catalyst, it is desired to incorporate the new metallosilicate zeolite with another material resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in organic conversion processes. Such materials include agave and inactive material and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and or metal oxides, e.g. alumina The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Use of a material in conjunction with the new zeolite crystal, i.e. combined therewith, which is active, tends to improve the conversion and or selectivtty of the catalyst in certain organic conversion processes.Inactive materials suitably serve as diiuents to control the amount of converson in a given process so that products can be obtained economically and orderly without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. These materials may be incorporated into naturally occurring clays, e.g. bentonite and kaolin, to improve the crush strength of the catalyst under commercial operating conditions. Said materials, i.e.clays, oxides, etc., function as binders for the catalyst It is desirable to provide a catalyst having good crush strength because in commercial use it is desirable to prevent the catalyst from breaking down into powder like materiais.These clay binders have been employed normally only for the purpose of improving the crush strength of the catalyst. Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the new crystal include the montmorillonite and kaolin families which include the subbentonites, and the kaolins com monly known as Dlxie, McNamee, Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloyslte, kaolinite, dickite, nacnte, or anauxite.Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to caicination, acid treatment or chemical modi fication.Binders useful for compositng with the present crystal also include inorganic oxides, notably alumina In addition to the foregoing materials, the zeolite can be composited with a porous matrix material such as silicaalumina silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica beryllia, silica titana as well as ternary compositions such as sdlca alumina thoria, silica alumina zlrconia, silica aiumina magnesla and siilca magnesia zirconia The relative proportions of finely divided crystalline material and inorganic oxide gel matrix vary widely, with the zeolite content ranging from 1 to 90 percent by weight and more usually, particularly when the composite is prepared in the form of beads, In the range of 2 to 80 weight percent of the composite, The metallosilicate zeolite of the present invention is useful as catalyst component for a variety of organic, e.g.hydrocarbon, compound conversion processes. Such conversion processes include, as non limiting examples, cracking hydrocarbons with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 3000C to 7000C, a pressure of from 10 to 3040 kPa 0.1 to 30 atmospheres and a weight houriy space velocity of from 0.1 to 20 dehydrogenating hydrocarbon compounds with reaction conditions including a tem perature of fron 3000C to 7000C, a pressure of from 10 to 1013 kPa 0.1 to 10 atmospheres and a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.1 to 20 converting paraffins to aromatic with reaction conditions Including a temperature of from 100 C to 700 C, a pressure of from 10 to 6080 kPa 0.1 to 60 atmospheres , a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.5 to 400 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from 0 to 20 converting olefins to aromatic, e.g.benzene, toluene and xylenes, with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 1000C to 7000C, a pressure of from 10 to 6080 kPa 0.1 to 60 atmospheres , a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.5 to 400 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from 0 to 20 converting alcohols, e.g. methanol, or ethers, e.g. dimethyiether, or mixtures thereof to hydrocarbons including aromatics with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 2750C to 600 C, a pressure of from 51 to 5066 kPa 0.5 to 50 atmospheres and a liquid hourly space velocity of from 0.5 to 100 isomerizing xylene feedstock components with reaction conditions including a temperature of frcm 230 C to 51000, a pressure of from 304 to 3546 kPa 3 to 35 atmospheres , a weight houriy space velocity of from 0.1 to 200 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from 0 to 100 disproportionating toluene with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 200 C to 7600C. a pressure of from 101 to 6080 kPa 1 to 60 atmospheres and a weight houriy space velocity of from 0.08 to 20 alkylating aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene and alkylbenzenes, in the presence of an alkylating agent, e.g. olefins, formaldehyde, alkyl halides and alcohols, with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 340 C to 5000C, a pressure of from 101 to 20265 kPa 1 to 200 atmospheres , a weight hourly space velocity of from 2 to 2000 and an aromatic hydrocarbonlalkylating agent mole ratio of from 1 1 to 20 1 and transalkyiating aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of polyalkyaromatic hydrocarbons with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 340 C to soo c, a pressure of from 101 to 20265 kPa 1 to 200 atmospheres , a weight hourly space velocity of from 10 to 1000 and an aromatic hydrocarbonlpolyalkylaromatic hydrocarbon mole ratio of from 1 1 to 16 1.
