## Description
METHOD FOR ISOLATING TETRACYCLINESThe subject of this invention is a method for isolating tetracyclines from the broth after biosynthesis or from the mother liquor after isolating crude bases by means of the ion exchange and sorption resins. Tetracyclines are a group of chemically related antibiotics having similar physical properties. Principal antibiotics in this group are tetracycline, oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline. These antibiotics are obtained by biosynthesis as the result of a fermentation process. After removing biomass from the wort a clear liquid, known as broth, remains which contains the water so luble salts of the antibiotics. Apart from the antibiotics a number of by products are formed during the fermentation process, their quantity depending on the parameters of the process. These by products remain in the broth. They can be devided into two groups.The first group includes macromolecular coloured substances of unidentified structure, sparingly soluble in water but fairly good in aqueous solutions of tetracyclines. They are the principal source of antibiotics impurity and are very difficult to be removed. The second group includes by products with low molecular weight, partially being the products of degradation of tetracyclines, partially unfermented constituents of the cultur medium. A number of methods for isolating tetracyclines on ion exchange resins are known. Tetracyclines are bound by the functional groups of strongly acid cation exchangers.The yields of the isolation of tetracyclines on the ionexchange resins are high. However, methods using ionexchange resins have two principal drawbacks. Tetracyclines are unstable in both strongly acid and basic media.Tetracycline molecules adsorbed on strongly acid functional groups are partially degraded, mostly into dehydrotetracyclines. The desorption of tetracyclines from the cationexchange resin requires washing of the sorbent bed with aqueous or non aqueous solutions of hydroxides, which causes alkaline decomposition of the molecule. Because of these difficulties no methods for isolating tetracyclines on ion exchange resins have been put into practice on commercial scale. A number of adsorbents, both natural and synthetic, with good adsorbing capacity for tetracyclines are known.However, it was found that all accessible and examined adsorbents having jood affinity to tetracyclines are also good adsorbents of the by products, particularly the macromolecular coloured substances. Eluates obtained by desorption of such adsorbents are highly contaminated.Isolation of antibiotics from such eluates is very difficult, and the isolated products are also highly contaminated.The attempts to obtain positive results by selective adsorption were ineffective. An important problem is also the regeneration of sorbent beds with the purpose of completely removing the tarry substances from the sorbents s surface and thereby preparing this surface for the following cycles of treatment. The sorbents are regenerated by washing with acetone or methanol or with an aqueous solution tereof, preferably acidified. It has been found that this method permits no full regenereion. Some quantities of tarry matter remain on the sorbents being regenerated if this method is used they accumulate during the following cycles, thus reducing the sorption capacity of the sorbents and giving higher contaminated products. After a longer period of use the sorbents become completely blocked. Unexpectedly, it has now been found that slightly alkaline anion exchange resins, e.g. Amberlite t A 21 orWofatite AD 41, with blocked functional groups have a very slight adsorption capacity for tetracyclines while they are very good adsorbents of impurities, particularly of the macromolecular coloured substances.The method of this invention is based on the above mentioned findings. The broth after removing biomass, or the mother liquor containing the acid aqueous solutions of tetracycline salts are passed through a system of not less than two columns connected in series. The first column contains an anion exchange resin with fuctional groups blocked by an anion of a mineral acid, e.g. by chloride or sulphate.The following column or columns contain a macroporous adsorption resin having good affinity to tetracyclines.Adsorbed tetracyclines are desorbed by washing with a 15 60X aqueous acid solution of acetone or methanol. Under the conditions mentioned above, practically only tetracyclines are desorbed and eventually isolated from the eluates using the known method of changing pH. The beds of anion exchange resin and macroporous sorption resin are next washed with aqueous acetone or methanol solution containing to 80 by volume of the organic solvent with addition of 0,2 6 by weight of sodium or potassium hydroxide or ammonia. Afterwards the beds are washed with water till the organic solvent is removed. The washing is preferably carried out with an aqueous solution of a mineral acid. It has also been found that the desorption of the tarry substances can be achieved by washing the sorbents with aqueous solutions of alkaline substances, containing no organic solvents. However, this desorption is not complete and requires from time to time an additional regeneration, using an organic solvent. The washing with the above mentioned aqueous solutions of alkaline substances is carried out with 0,5 8 by weight solutions of either sodium or potassium hydroxide or of ammonia. After a few cycles up to a dozen cycles or so an additional washing with an aqueous acetone or methanol solution is carried out, which contains up to 80 of the organic solvent with the addition of 0,2 to 6 sodium or potassium hydroxide or ammonia.Table 1 shows by way of example the desorption of an anionexchange resin after adsorption of tarry substances. The static method using aqueous sodiumhydroxide solutions of varying concentrations was used for this test. The desorption was determined as the colour of the solution after the desorption, in of transmittance T . The lower the T the higher the desorption degree. Table 1.

The method of this invention can be applied as a self contained method for isolating tetracyclines from the broth obtained from the wort after removal of the biomass, or with other methods as complementary method for recovering antibiotics from mother liquors and production wastes.The method enables attaining of high yields and high degrees of purification.Example I.Broth from the biosynthesis of oxytetracycline after the removal of biomass, containing 5670 units cm3 and having pH 1,9 was passed through a three column system. The first column was filled with macroporous anion exchange resin in the chloride form Amberlite A 21 . The two other columns contained a macroporous hydrophobic sorption resin type Amberlit XAB 4 . The flow rate of the broth through the system was 4 volumes per bed volume and per hour.After having passed ca 25 volumes of the liquid in relation to the bed volume of one column it was found that the eluate from the secondkolumn contained 920 units of antibiotic 3 3 in cm and the eluate from the third column 3 8 units cmAt this moment the sorption was taken as being complete, and the desorption of the second column was started in order to attain the tetracycline recovery and the regeneration of the adsorbent surface. For desorption an aqueous solution of acetone containing 30 of acetone and acidified with sulphuric acid to pH 1,5 was passed through the bed from above. After having passed ca 2 volumes of said solution, the main fraction was collected. The flow rate of aqueous solution of acetone was 1,5 volume per bed volume and per hour.On the whole 1,5 volume of aqueous acetone solution relating to the volume of bed in the column was passed through the bed. The antibiotic was isolated from the tetracycline containing eluate fraction by means of raising pH. In order to regenerate the sorbent surface an 1 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was introduced from above into the column. Every fraction collected from the bottom of the column was mixed and analysed for pH and colour in of transmittance .Using the above described method, for regeneration cycles were carried out after subsequent sorption cycles. A decrease of sorption capacity and a diminuition of the efficiency of removal of tarry matter were observed after the fourth regeneration. After four consecutive sorption and regeneration cycles the sorbent was washed from the top of the column with a 25 aqueous solution of acetone containing 0,5 of sodium hydroxide.After having collected 9 volumes the bed was washed with water till the odour of acetone diappeared. No decreasing of sorption capacity of the sorbent was observed after several scores of repeated sorption and regeneration cycles.Example II.A mother liquor obtained after precipitating crude tetracycline, which liquor contained 810 units of antibiotic in one cm3 was passed through the three column systems of example I, using a flow rate of 5 volumes per bed volume and per hour, till the antibiotic concentration after the 3 second column amounted to 520 units cm . This was achieved after having passed 150 volumes of the liquid. The second column was then disconnected for the recovery of antibiotic. The tetraclciine desorption was carried out as described in the example I except that an aqueous solution containing 20 of acetone acidified with hydrochloric acid to obtain pH 1,5 was used. The sorbents were regenerated as in example I except that the sorbents were washed with 15 volumes relating to the volume of sorbent bed of a 4 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The sorbents were then washed with an 1 aqueous solution of sulphuric acid. 10 regeneration cycles of the sorbe1t, after successive sorption cycles, were carried Out dS described. A 6 aqueous solution of methanol with audition of 1, cf sodium hydroxide was passed through the sorbents after the tenth regeneration. After having collected 8 volumes the bed was washed with water to remove the methyl alcohol. Thus a full regeneration of the sorbent surface was achieved.Example III.Sorption and desorption were carried out as in example II.For regenerating the sorbent a 10 aqueous acetone solutionalkalified with 2 by weight of ammonia added was used. Markedly lighter effluent from the column was obtained after having passed 4 volumes of eluate. The sorbent was washed with water as in example I. Full regeneration of sorbent was achieved without observing any decrease of sorption capacity during the following sorption and desorption cycles.
