# Contact material of vacuum interrupter and manufacturing process therefor.

## Abstract
Contact materials of a vacuum interrupter and producing process therefor are disclosed. The contact materials provide a contact which is much high in relatively large current and small lagging and leading current interrupting capabilities and dielectric strength while a little in an anti welding capability down. The contact materials are composed of between 20 and 70 weight copper, between 5 and 70 weight molybdenum and between 5 and 70 weight chromium. The contact material is produced by diffusion bonding a mixture of molybdenum powder and chromium powder into a porous matrix and infiltrating the matrix with copper. Alternatively, the contact materials may be produced by sintering a mixture of three metal powders.
