# Method of making electrodes.

## Abstract
Method of making an electrode wherein a suspension in a liquid is prepared of a powdered catalyst containing a noble metal, carbon powder and a binder, and the suspen sion is poured over a carbon substrate dried, compressed and sintered. A carbon paper is placed on the surface of the carbon substrate over which the suspension was poured prior to compressing the substrate. The electrode can be used as either a cathode or an anode in a sulfuric acid electrolyte used in a process for producing hydrogen from water.
