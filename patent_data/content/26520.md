# Photographic silver halide development in the presence of thioether development activators method, developer and photographic element.

## Abstract
Photographic elements containing image wise developable silver halide are developed in the presence of an oxathioether development activator according to the formula R¹ A OCH₂CH₂ The development activators can be used in black and white development or in colour development. They can be incorporated in the photographic material or in the developing solution. In reversal processing they can also accomplish the task of the second exposure or of the fogging agent to render the silver halide remaining after the first development developable.
