# Apparatus for monitoring signals at selected test points of a monitored device.

## Abstract
Selected test points 1, 4, 5 of a monitored device 100 are multiplexed by a multiplexor 103 and converted to digital form by an ADC 104 . The output digital signals are examined by a processor 105 to determine their polarity and also the number of transitions, as crossings about nominal values, over predetermined intervals. In reponse to outputs from the processor, a display device 106 for example a printer, produces a record indicating, for each selected test point, the number of changes in the signal from one level to another and the number of crossings occurring at the levels due, for example, to ringing.
