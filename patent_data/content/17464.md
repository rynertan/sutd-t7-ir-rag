# Apparatus for endoscopic photography.

## Abstract
An apparatus for endoscopic photography 1 includes a camera 3 and a light source unit 4 which may be coupled to an endoscope 2 to permit a picture to be taken of the interior of a coeliac cavity. An operating signal is converted into a high frequency signal by means of a conversion circuit which is disposed in one of the camera 3 and the light source unit 4 , a recovery circuit for recovering the operating signal from the high frequency signal being disposed in the other of the camera and the light source unit. In this manner, a communication of the operating signal between the camera 3 and the light source unit 4 is enabled through d.c. feed lines 12a, 12b disposed within the endoscope which are utilized to feed a film winding d.c. motor.
