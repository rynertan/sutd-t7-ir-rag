# Method of producing a continuous thin film magnetic medium.

## Abstract
A method for producing a continuous thin film magnetic medium by electrochemical plating deposition, useful for perpendicular recording. The plated medium comprises a substrate 12 upon which is deposited a thin magnetic layer 14 consisting of acicular shaped crystalline particles with the crystallographic c axis of the crystal in each particle oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the particle acicular and the longitudinal axis of the acicular particles oriented substantially normal to the plane of said magnetic layer. The method comprises the steps of providing an electrochemical plating bath 40 containing a salt solution 44 of the magnetic elemental component or alloy thereof, e.g., Co salt solution, the bath having a predetermined ion concentration and electrodepositing 46, 48, 50 the elemen tal component or alloy thereof on the substrate while maintaining the maximum pH value of the salt solution at a point before the precipitation of a secondary precipitate, e.g., Co OH â‚‚, will occur in the bath solution bulk.
