## Description
The present invention relates to an oversampling converter for performing A D or D A conversion at a clock frequency much higher than a signal frequency. It is generally known that an original signal can be reproduced according to the Nyquist s theorem at a sampling frequency f In a conventional oversampling A D or D A converter, its sampling frequency f For example, a conversion error of an A D converter occurs when a sampled analog signal is quantized to a digital signal. This quantization error is the difference between an input voltage and a quantized voltage of a quantizer, and is given as a random value falling within an amplitude range of V Because the total of quantization noise power is determined by the noise amplitude, the higher the sampling frequency f When oversampling is performed at a frequency which is 64 times the sampling frequency f A typical conventional oversampling A D converter is exemplified by a delta sigma oversampling A D converter. The delta sigma oversampling A D converters are divided into two types single integration type converter and a double integration type converter. A single integration type converter is described in IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, August 1981, Vol. SC 16 No. 4, T. Misawa J.E. Iwersen, Single Chip per Channel Codec with Filters Utilizing Δ Σ Modulation pp. 333 341. This codec has a single integrator, a quantizer for quantizing an output from the integrator, and a negative feedback path for feeding back an output from the quantizer to an input terminal of the integrator. Typical examples of such codecs are shown in Fig. 20A an A D converter and Fig. 20B a D A converter . Referring to Figs. 20A and 20B, reference numeral 1 denotes a signal input terminal 2, a signal output terminal 3, a quantizer 4, a digital to analog converter to be referred to as a D A converter hereinafter 5, an integrator circuit 5 1, an integrator constituting the integrator circuit 6, an adder and 7, a delay circuit inserted between the output terminal of the quantizer 3 and the D A converter 4. In the circuits in Figs. 20A and 20B, the integrator circuit 5 distributes a majority of quantization noise components in the high frequency range, the noise level being low in the low frequency range and high in the high frequency range. Therefore, the S N ratio is higher than that in the method of simply increasing the sampling frequency f With the above arrangement, a quantizer output V A signal component of the first term of equation 1 is In order to convert the obtained digital signal to an analog signal again, a D A converter 4 is used. Conversion precision of the D A converter 4 is determined by resolution and linearity. In general, a reference voltage is divided by resistor or capacitor elements in accordance with an input signal to generate an output voltage. It is possible to improve the resolution by increasing the number of elements. However, when each output voltage is not accurately linear, a decoded analog voltage is inevitably distorted, analog output linearity depends on the precision of elements constituting the D A converter, so in order to obtain a high precision D A converter, a large number of high precision elements are required therein. Conversely, the accurate output analog voltage can be obtained at a low resolution with a binary output one bit resolution and a ternary output 2 bit resolution without using a plurality of elements. In this case, high precision linearity can be obtained irrespective of precision of the elements. Since any two points given by binary outputs are plotted on a line, substantially no problems with linearity occur. For ternary outputs, a positive or negative reference voltage is charged by or not charged by a single capacitor element to obtain three voltages of good linearity. Since linearity of a D A converter with a low resolution of 1 to 2 bits can be guaranteed, high conversion precision can be achieved only if a conversion error occurring at low resolution is decreased. To achieve this, a D A converter with a one bit resolution is used. The basic arrangement of such a D A converter is given as follows An input signal is supplied to an integrator, and an output therefrom is quantized by a quantizer, and is then converted by a D A converter to an analog signal. In this case, the output from the quantizer is negatively fed back to the input side of the integrator, thereby decreasing noise. In order to obtain higher conversion precision than the single integration type delta sigma oversampling converter, a double integration type delta sigma oversampling converter has been proposed. A typical example of this type of converter is described in U.S.P. No. 4,439,756. Double integration type delta sigma converters are exemplified in Fig. 21A an A D converter and Fig. 21B a D A converter . With the given arrangements, when a transfer function of an additional integrator is given as H₂, and other arrangements are the same as those of the single integration type converter in Fig. 20A, B, a quantized output V The second term total noise of converter, V As is apparent from the second term in equation 2 , the noise components of the quantizer are greatly decreased from those of the single integration type delta sigma converter. A converter for improving an S N ratio by changing the noise frequency distribution characteristics is called a noise shaping type converter. More particularly, in the converters in Figs. 20A and 20B, if f In the circuit arrangements in Figs. 20A and 20B and Figs. 21A and 21B, the integrators 5 1, 5 2, and 5 4 are normally constituted by operational amplifiers which have an operation speed lower than that of the quantizer 3 and the D A converter 4. For this reason, the operation speed of the integrators substantially determines the upper limit of the sampling frequency f More specifically, when an increase in S N ratio in each arrangement of Figs. 21A and 21B at f If a resolution of the quantizer is N However, when the additional integrator is used, the possibility of loop oscillation is high. In order to guarantee operation stability, a phase lead bypath must be arranged. When a triple or more integration type converter is used, loop oscillation inevitably occurs. In addition, when at least two integrators are cascade connected to constitute a feedback loop, processing time is at least doubled, and the sampling frequency is decreased. With such an arrangement, when an input signal level is high, the loop becomes unstable. As a result, the S N ratio is decreased. On the contrary, in order to obtain a high integrator gain with a single integrator, an amplifier with a high gain is required. In this case, a wide bandwidth cannot be used, and the sampling frequency f In short, when the number of integrators is increased, high conversion precision cannot be obtained in conventional delta sigma oversampling converters. From EP A 0 060 583 a system for quantization of signals is known in which the quantizing means are arranged to provide a second quantized output signal. The output signals of the two networks are combined to one output signal. On combining the received signals, the quantizing noise in the first received signal is cancelled by that portion of the quantizing noise in the second received signal which is proportional to the quantizing noise of the first quantized output signal of the quantizing means. Document Proceedings of the institution of electrical engineers , November 1973, pages 1379 1382, discloses a 2 stage delta modulator, wherein the input signal is successively coded in a multistage coder, which constitutes several delta coders connected in parallel. The signal at the output of the integrator of the first coder is compared with the input, and the resultant, which is the quantizing noise, is fed to the second coder after proper band limitation. It is, therefore, a principal object of the present invention to provide an oversampling converter with higher conversion precision than that of conventional oversampling converters. It is another object of the present invention to provide a low cost, compact small chip area oversampling converter which achieves the principal object described above. It is still another object of the present invention to provide an oversampling converter which can sufficiently supress quantization noise, even if multiple integration is performed. It is still another object of the present invention to provide an oversampling converter using a high sampling frequency, which is achieved in addition to the above mentioned objects. It is still another object of the present invention to provide an oversampling converter which has high loop stability and a high S N ratio assured against a high input signal level. In order to achieve the above subjects of the present invention, there is provided an oversampling converter according to the features of claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows an oversampling A D converter according to an embodiment of the present invention. This converter includes two loops, each of which includes an integrator and an integrator and a quantizer. Referring to Fig. 1, reference numeral 11 denotes a signal input terminal 12, a signal output terminal 13, an integrator for integrating a difference between the input terminal voltage and the feedback voltage 14, a quantizer for quantizing an output voltage from the integrator 13 to a digital signal 15, a delay circuit for receiving an output from the quantizer 14 16, a D A converter for receiving an output from the delay circuit 15 and converting the digital signal to an analog voltage signal and 17, an adder for receiving the input terminal voltage V Reference numeral 21 denotes an adder for receiving an output from the adder 20 and an output from a D A converter 25 22, an integrator for integrating an output from the adder 21 23, a quantizer for digitizing an output voltage from the integrator 22 to a digital signal 24, a delay circuit for receiving the digital output signal from the quantizer 23 25, the D A converter for converting the digital output signal from the delay circuit 24 to an analog voltage signal 26, a differentiator for differentiating an output from the quantizer 23 and 27, an adder for adding an output from the differentiator 26 and an output from the delay circuit 18, and supplying the sum as a digital output signal to the signal output terminal 12. Thin lines in the drawing are analog signal lines and thick lines are digital signal lines. The integrators 13 and 22 have a larger gain when an input signal frequency is lower. Transfer functions of the integrators 13 and 22 are given as H₁₁ and H₁₂. The differentiator 26 has an inverted characteristic to that of the integrator 13. Its inverted transfer function is given as 1 H₁₃. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the integrator 13, the quantizer 14, the delay circuit 15, the D A converter 16, and the adder 17 constitute a first loop, and the integrator 22, the quantizer 23, the delay circuit 24, the D A converter 25 and the adder 21 constitute a second loop, and an output from the delay circuit 18 is the first loop output and an output from the quantizer 23 is the 2nd loop output. The operation cf the oversampling A D converter shown in Fig. 1 will now be described. A difference between the outputs from the integrator 13 and the D A converter 16 is calculated by the adder 20 as a quantization error in the first loop. The difference signal is supplied as an input signal to the second loop. The output from the first loop quantizer 14 is added by the adder 27 to a signal obtained by differentiating the output from the second loop quantizer 23 by the differentiator 26, thereby obtaining a digital output signal. With this arrangement, main conversion errors included in the digital output signal are quantization errors generated by the quantizers 14 and 23. The quantization error voltages from the quantizers 14 and 23 are given as V If the output from the first loop quantizer 14 is V When a second loop input signal is given as V An error component V A digital output signal V The term V If H₁₁ H₁₂ H₁₃ 1 1 Z ¹ , the noise component in equation 7 is given as equation 8 below As is apparent from equation 8 , the level of noise voltage appearing at the signal output terminal 12 is low in a low frequency range, and high in a high frequency range. Therefore, the oversampling A D converter of this embodiment has an improved S N ratio in the same manner as in the conventional double integral delta sigma converter of Fig. 21A or 21B. A magnitude of the quantization error voltage V If the range of the signal voltage V The conventional amplitude voltage range of V The second loop input signal V The embodiment shown in Fig. 1 exemplifies an oversampling A D converter constituted by two loops, each of which includes an integrator and a quantizer. However, the oversampling A D converter may be constituted by three or more loops. Fig. 2 shows an oversampling A D converter constituted by three loops according to another embodiment of the present invention. The same reference numerals in Fig. 2 denote the same parts as in Fig. 1. In addition, reference numeral 28 denotes a delay circuit for receiving an output from an integrator 22 29, an adder for adding an output from the delay circuit 28 and an output from a D A converter 25 30, an adder for adding an output from the adder 29 and an output from a D A converter 34 31, an integrator with a transfer function H₁₄ for integrating an output from the adder 30 32, a quantizer with a quantization noise V In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the differentiator 31, the quantizer 32, the delay circuit 33, the D A converter 34 and the adder 30 constitute a third loop, and the output supplied from the quantizer 32 is the 3rd loop output. Thus, the third loop, the differentiator 37, and the adder 38 are added to the embodiment of Fig. 1. The operation of this embodiment will now be described. A third loop input V An output V A digital output signal V When the transfer functions H₁₁ to H₁₅ are defined as 1 1 Z ¹ , the noise component V When the number of loops is increased from two to three, the noise component V The oversampling converter of the present invention will now be compared with the conventional converters in Figs. 20A and 20B and Figs. 21A and 21B, so as to explain an increase in S N ratio. In order to do so, the S N ratio of the circuit in Fig. 1 is calculated in the same manner as in those of the conventional circuits. When the transfer function H₁₁ of the integrator 13, the transfer function H₁₂ of the integrator 22, and the transfer function 1 H₁₃ of the differentiator 26 are the same as that of a single integrator i.e., H₁₁ to H₁₃ 1 1 Z ¹ , the operation speed of the loop is mostly determined by the integrator. Respective loops in Fig. 1 are simultaneously operated at the same sampling frequency f If f In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the sampling frequency f The embodiment of Fig. 2 is different from that of Fig. 1 in such a manner that the increase by noise shaping is 86 dB, that V Since the S N ratio of the conventional circuit in Fig. 21A or 21B is 69.8 dB, the S N ratio of the circuit of these embodiments are increased by 21 dB and 54 dB. The above S N ratio calculations are performed with equations 8 and 13 . Equations 8 and 13 are given under the condition where the transfer functions H₁₁ to H₁₅ of the integrators and differentiators are identical. However, since the integrators 13 and 22 in the circuit of the embodiment in Fig. 1 are analog circuits, their transfer functions H₁₁ and H₁₂ may vary due to fabrication variations. Figs. 3 a and 3 b are detailed arrangements of integrators constituted by switched capacitor circuits. Referring to Fig. 3 a , reference numeral 40 denotes an integrator. In Fig. 3 b , showing the detailed arrangement of the integrator 40, reference numerals 40 1 to 40 4 denote switch circuits analog switches 40 5 and 40 6, capacitor elements and 40 7, an operational amplifier. In these circuits, the ON OFF operations of the switch circuits are controlled by signals from a switch control circuit, as in a known switched capacitor circuit. A converter using such a switched capacitor circuit is exemplified in U.S.P. No. 4,439,756. In the integrator constituted by the above switched capacitor circuit, the transfer function varies due to precision of the capacitor elements 40 5, and 40 6. In the circuit shown in Figs. 3 a and 3 b , if capacitances of the capacitor elements 40 5 and 40 6 are given as C The gain of the transfer function H₀ varies due to specific precision of the capacitances C In the circuit in Fig. 1, if H₁₁ H₁₂ H₁₃ in equation 6 , V In equation 15 , the value of 1 α₁ is determined by the capacitance ratio precision 0.5 to 0.05 . If f The A D converter according to the present invention can obtain a high S N ratio without using high precision elements. The detailed circuits of the integrators used in the embodiments of Figs. 1 and 2 are exemplified by the circuits in Figs. 3 a and 3 b . The design conditions met by these integrators are The integrators in Figs. 3 a and 3 b satisfy the above conditions. The transfer functions H₁₁, H₁₂, etc. of the integrators of the respective loops must be identical, as described above. Even if the noise level is increased in a frequency range higher than the signal frequency range, the S N ratio within the signal frequency range is not degraded. Therefore, the transfer functions need only be identical within the signal frequency range. In order to decrease high frequency noise levels outside the signal bandwidth, the transfer functions are preferably identical throughout the bandwidth. Fig. 4 shows still another embodiment of the present invention. The converter in Fig. 4 is substantially the same as that in Fig. 1, except that integrators 45 and 46 are added. Reference numeral 47 denotes an adder for adding first loop output through the integrator 46 and second loop output through the differentiator 26 and supplying the sum digital signal to a signal output terminal 12. With the above arrangement, the output from the integrator 45 is compared with the input signal voltage. Even if an output voltage from a D A converter 16 is small, the circuit can be stably operated at high speed in response to the input signal due to a low frequency gain of the integrator 45, under the condition that a level of a high frequency component included in the input signal is low. A quantization error voltage generated by a quantizer 14 can be decreased to obtain a high S N ratio. A digital output signal V Since the term V Substitution of equations 17 into equation 16 yields equation 18 below As is apparent from equation 18 , the noise component is the same as that in equation 8 . As described above, however, V If the integrator, as the analog circuit portion represented by thin lines in the drawing, is constituted by a switched capacitor circuit, the transfer characteristics with small variations can be obtained. Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram showing a detailed arrangement of the embodiment of Fig. 1. The integrator in Fig. 1 comprises a single integrating element H₁₁ H₁₂ H₁₃ 1 1 Z ¹ constituted by a switched capacitor circuit. Thick lines in the drawing indicate digital signal lines, and thin lines indicate analog signal lines. The same reference numerals in Fig. 5 denote the same parts in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 5, reference numerals 50 1 to 50 4, 50 8 to 50 11, 50 16 to 50 19, and 50 23 to 50 26 denote switch circuits analog switches 50 5, 50 7, 50 12, 50 20, 50 22 and 50 27, capacitor elements 50 6 and 50 21, operational amplifiers 51, an adder and 52 and 53, switch control circuits. The quantizer 14 is constituted by voltage comparators 50 13 and 50 14. A quantizer 23 is constituted by voltage comparators 50 28 and 50 29. The integrator in Fig. 5 is the same switching capacitor circuit type shown in Figs. 3 a and 3 b . The operation of the embodiment in Fig. 5 will be described hereinafter. The capacitor element 50 5 capacitance C When the capacitor element 50 12 with the capacitance C Fig. 6 is a graph showing the frequency spectrum distribution characteristics of the digital signal output in Fig. 5, that is, the output noise frequency spectrum distribution characteristics of the A D converter of this embodiment. In the graphs f It is readily understood from the graph that the noise level in the low frequency range is greatly decreased. Fig. 7 shows as graph of the S N ratio characteristics a curve The S N ratio characteristics in Fig. 7 are obtained when f A detailed operation of the switch control circuits 52, 53 will be described hereinafter. The control circuit processes clock pulses CLK supplied from a clock generator not shown and generates two phase clocks A and B whose ON times do not overlap, as shown in Figs. 8 b and 8 c , by a delay circuit DL, a NOR gate NR and an AND gate AD. The clocks A and B are supplied to the analog switches 50 1 to 50 4, 50 8 and 50 9 which are turned on off. The control circuit also has two switches S₁ and S₂ which are switched in response to an output from the quantizer 14, thereby generating and supplying clocks C and D respectively to the analog switches 50 10 and 50 11 which are turned on off, as shown in Figs. 8 d to 8 i . When an input to the quantizer 14 is less than V According to the present invention as described above, a multiple quantization operation is performed by a plurality of quantization loops to greatly decrease the noise level in the low frequency range, so that a high S N ratio can be obtained in a signal frequency range sufficiently lower than the sampling frequency f As is apparent from the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, the analog circuit scale is very small, and a digital filter can be used in place of the conventional analog filter to eliminate outband noise components falling outside the signal bandwidth. However, along with advances of IC micropatterning, the integration density of digital circuits is larger than that of analog circuits. Because of this, a digital circuit arrangement decreases the chip size and the present invention is thus suitable for integration circuits. Therefore, the chip size of the digital filter can be decreased as compared with that of the precise analog circuit. For example, when the A D converter is formed together with a filter on a single chip, the conventional circuit requires an analog filter in front of the A D converter and is mainly constituted by analog components. However, according to the present invention, since the filter is constituted by a digital circuit, the number of analog circuits is very small. Therefore, the present invention can provide a compact A D converter of high precision at low cost. The oversampling A D converter of the present invention provides unique effects as compared with the conventional A D converter and performs conversion at a frequency higher than the signal frequency with high conversion precision. Fig. 9 shows still another embodiment of the present invention. The same reference numerals in Fig. 9 denote the same parts in Fig. 1. The embodiment in Fig. 9 is substantially the same as that in Fig. 1, except that an output from an integrator constituting a second loop, i.e., a subloop is fed back to the output side of an integrator of a first loop, i.e., a main loop. The output from an integrator 13 is added by an adder 60 to an output from an integrator 22, and the sum signal is supplied to a quantizer 14. With this arrangement, the quantization error of the main loop can be suppressed even if a gain of an operational amplifier constituting the integrator is low. More specifically, the adder 60 adds the output from the integrator 13 of the main loop and the output from the integrator 22 of the subloop, and supplies the sum signal to the quantizer 14, so that a voltage V wherein H₁₁ H₁₂ is assumed for the sake of simplicity. When the output from the integrator 13 is as high as the ideal state and H₁₃ H₁₁, the same S N ratio as in the embodiment of Fig. 1 can be obtained. However, when the gain of the operational amplifier constituting the integrator 13 is not sufficiently high and so H₁₃ H₁₁, a high gain in the second term including V The second term of equation 19 is given as follows Fig. 11 a shows the S N ratio of teh A D converter of Fig. 1 and Fig. 11 b shows that of the Fig. 9 when the sampling frequency f Fig. 10 shows a detailed arrangement of the converter in Fig. 9. In this case, the integrator and the D A converter are constituted by switched capacitor circuits in the same as the detailed arrangement described in Fig. 5. The same reference numerals in Fig. 10 denote the same parts as in Fig. 5. However, quantizers 14 and 23 are constituted by single comparators COMP1 and COMP2, respectively, unlike in the embodiment of Fig. 5. Each comparator receives the output from the corresponding operational amplifier 50 6, 50 21 constituting the integrator at the noninverting input terminal, and the inverting input terminal of the comparator is grounded. The operation of the converter with the arrangement in Fig. 10 will be described hereinafter. An input terminal voltage from a signal input terminal 11 is charged by a capacitor element 50 5 capacitance C Since the timing of the integral operation of the charge of the capacitor element 50 5 C The capacitor elements 50 12 C In the embodiment shown in Fig. 9, almost no decrease in S N ratio occurs at a low input signal level as compared with a case wherein the amplifier has a sufficiently high gain. A decrease in S N ratio is detected at a large input level. However, such a decrease rarely presents any practical problems. Fig. 12 is a graph showing changes in S N ratio when a DC offset voltage is superposed on an analog signal input in the embodiment of Fig. 10. Even if an offset voltage of 0.01 to 0.05 V is superposed on the input analog signal within the input signal range, the S N ratio is found not to change substantially. Fig. 13 is a graph showing the relationship between the S N ratio and the specific precision of the capacitor elements in the switched capacitor circuit used in the embodiment of Fig. 10. Fig. 13 exemplifies the capacitor element 50 27 C Fig. 14 shows a modification of the embodiment shown in Fig. 10. The adder 60 in Fig. 10 is eliminated, and the output from the operational amplifier 50 21 constituting the integrator of the second loop is connected to the inverting input terminal of the comparator COMP1 constituting the quantizer 14. When switching orders of the analog switches 50 18 and 50 19 connected to the capacitor element 50 20 C With the circuit arrangements in Figs. 10 and 14, a high S N ratio can be obtained by using an operational amplifier with a low gain without increasing the circuit size. In addition, the dependency of S N ratio on the input offset voltage is small. High precision can be achieved even if elements with low precision are used. Therefore, an A D converter with high precision can be formed on an integrated circuit at low cost without performing any adjustments after fabrication. Fig. 15 shows still another embodiment wherein an oversampling converter of the present invention is applied to a D A converter. The D A converter is constituted by two loops, each of which includes an integration and a quantizer. Referring to Fig. 15, reference numeral 111 denotes a digital signal input terminal 112, an analog signal output terminal 113, an integrator for integrating a difference between the digital input signal and a feedback signal 114, a quantizer for decreasing a resolution the number of bits of the digital output from the integrator 113 115, a delay circuit for receiving an output from the quantizer 114 116, a D A converter for converting the digital signal as an output from the delay circuit 115 to an analog signal 117, a delay circuit for receiving the output from the quantizer 114 118, an adder for adding the digital input signal from the digital signal input terminal 111 and the feedback signal from the delay circuit 117 and for supplying a sum signal to the integrator 113 119, a delay circuit for receiving the output from the integrator 113 120, an adder for adding an output from the delay circuit 119 and an output from the delay circuit 117 121, an adder for receiving an output from the adder 120 and an output from a delay circuit 124 122, an integrator for integrating a difference between the feedback signal and the input digital signal as an output from the adder 121 123, a quantizer for decreasing a resolution of a digital output from the integrator 122 124, the delay circuit for receiving an output from the quantizer 123 and supplying the feedback signal to the adder 121 125, a differentiator for differentiating an output from the quantizer 123 126, a D A converter for converting a digital signal as output from the differentiator 125 to an analog signal and 127, an adder for adding an output from the D A converter 126 and the output from the D A converter 116. An output from the adder 127 appears at the analog signal output terminal 112. Thin lines indicate digital signal lines, and thick lines indicate analog signal lines. The integrators 113 and 122 have higher gains when a frequency of the input signal is lower, and have transfer functions H₃₁ and H₃₂, respectively. The differentiator 125 has an inverted transfer function of that of the integrator 113, which is given as 1 H₃₃. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 15, the integrator 113, the quantizer 114, the delay circuit 117, and the adder 118 constitute a first loop, and the integrator 122, the quantizer 123, the delay circuit 124, and the adder 121 constitute a second loop and an output from the delay circuit 115 is the first loop output and an output from the quantizer 123 is the 2nd loop output. The operation of the D A converter in Fig. 15 will be described hereinafter. A difference between outputs from the first loop integrator 113 and the quantizer 114 is calculated by the adder 120 as a quantization error in the first loop. The output from the adder 120 serves as an input signal for the second loop. The output from the first loop quantizer 114 and a signal obtained by processing the output from the second loop quantizer 123 by the differentiator 125 are converted by the D A converters 116 and 126 to analog signals, respectively. The converted analog signals are then added by the adder 127, thereby obtaining the analog output signal. Quantization errors of the quantizers 114 and 123 are given as V The outputs from the first loop quantizer 114 and the integrator 113 are given as V The second loop input signal is given as V An error component of V An analog output signal V The term V If the noise component in equation 25 is V Equation 26 indicates that noise voltages are distributed at the same frequency characteristics as indicated by equation 2 for the conventional circuit. A magnitude of the quantization error V If a range of the digital signal applied to the digital signal input terminal 111 is normalized to be 1, and the quantizers 114 and 123 have resolutions of N As previously described, linearity of the D A converter 116, 126 is guaranteed independently of element precision when the converter has a one to two hit resolution. Since the resolution of the D A converter is the same as that of the quantizer, the quantizer normally has a one to two bit resolution. When the quantizer has a one bit resolution, the amplitude ranges of V The second loop input signal V An increase in S N ratio in the embodiment of Fig. 15 will be described as compared with that of the conventional circuit. An S N ratio of the circuit in Fig. 15 is calculated in the same manner as in the conventional circuits in Figs. 20B, 21B so as to compare the S N ratio of the embodiment in Fig. 15 and that of the conventional circuits. If the transfer function H₃₁ of the integrator 113, the transfer function H₃₂ of the integrator 122, and the transfer function 1 H₃₃ of the differentiator 125 are given as H₃₁ H₃₂ H₃₃ 1 1 Z ¹ of the single integrator, the operation speed of the loop is mostly determined by the integrator requiring a multi bit adder. Therefore, the loops in Fig. 15 can be simultaneously operated at the same sampling frequency f If f 90.8 dB 6 dB x 2 bits 1 1.8 dB 83 dB Thus, a higher S N ratio can be obtained by the embodiment described above as compared with that of the conventional circuit arrangement. The S N ratio is calculated by assuming that the D A converters 116 and 126 generate accurate outputs. However, since the D A converters 116 and 126 in Fig. 15 are analog circuits, output voltage precision is degraded by low element precision or the like. The embodiment in Fig. 15 is constituted by the two loops, each of which includes an integrator and a quantizer. However, an oversampling converter may be constituted by two or more loops. Fig. 16 is a block diagram of still another embodiment of the present invention showing a circuit arrangement constituted by three loops. The same reference numerals in Fig. 16 denote the same parts in Fig. 15. Referring to Fig. 16, reference numeral 128 denotes a delay circuit for receiving an output from an integrator 122 129, an adder for adding an output from the delay circuit 128 and an output from a delay circuit 124 130, an adder for adding an output from the adder 129 and an output from a delay circuit 133 131, an integrator for receiving an output from the adder 130 132, a quantizer for decreasing a resolution of a digital output from the integrator 131 133, the delay circuit for receiving an output from the quantizer 132 and supplying a feedback signal to the adder 130 134, a differentiator for differentiating an output from the quantizer 132 135, a D A converter for converting a digital signal from the differentiator 134 to an analog signal 136 and 137, delay circuits inserted between a delay circuit 115 and a D A converter 116 and between the differentiator 125 and a D A converter 126, respectively 138, an adder for adding an output from the D A converter 126 and an output from the D A converter 135 and 139, an adder for adding an output from the adder 138 and an output from the D A converter 116, and supplying the sum signal to a signal output terminal 112. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 16, a third loop constituted by the adder 130, the integrator 131, the quantizer 132, and the delay circuit 133 is added to the arrangement in Fig. 15. The operation of the circuit having the arrangement in Fig. 16 will be described hereinafter. A third loop input V An output V wherein a transfer function of the differentiator 134 is given as An analog output signal V If the noise component in equation 30 is defined as V When the number of loops, each with an integrator and a quantizer, is increased from two to three, the expression for the noise component V Fig. 17 shows a D A converter which has a one to two bit resolution and which is constituted by a switched capacitor circuit. Referring to Fig. 17, reference symbol V If capacitances of the capacitor elements 141 1 to 141 3 are given as C Z ¹ is substantially 1 at a signal frequency bandwidth sufficiently lower than the sampling frequency f In this manner, a linearity problem does not occur in the D A converter with one capacitor element. However, the gain, i.e., the absolute value of the output voltage, changes in accordance with a change in capacitive ratio C When capacitive ratio precision is 0.5 to 0.05 as described above, α 0.995 to 0.9995. The term 1 α represents a value of 0.005 to 0.0005 46 to 66 dB . A gain of 1 Z ¹ at f The transfer function of the integrator need not be the same as that of the ideal integrator element. The design conditions of the integrator are The transfer functions H₁, H₂, etc. of the integrators of the respective loops must be identical, as described above. However, the S N ratio within the signal band is not degraded even if the noise level is increased at a frequency band higher than the signal bandwidth. Therefore, the transfer functions need be identical only within the signal band. In order to decrease a high frequency noise level excluding the signal bandwidth, the transfer functions are preferably identical throughout the entire band. Fig. 18 shows still another embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment in Fig. 18 is substantially the same as that in Fig. 15, except that integrators 143 and 144 are added to the arrangement in Fig. 15. With this arrangement, since the output from the integrator 144 is compared with an input signal, the integrator 144 can be properly operated in response to the speed of the input signal because of its low frequency gain even if an output value from a quantizer 114 is small. In other words, the quantization error generated by the quantizer 114 is decreased to obtain a high S N ratio. The analog output signal V When the term V Substitution of equations 35 into equation 34 yields equation 36 According to equation 36 , the noise component is the same as those in equation 26 described with reference to Fig. 15. As described above, V Fig. 19 is a circuit diagram when the integrator network is constituted by a single integrating element H₃₁ H₃₂ H₃₃ 1 1 Z ¹ in the arrangement of Fig. 15. The same reference numerals in Fig. 19 denote the same parts as in Fig. 15, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted. A D A converter in Fig. 19 is obtained by applying the circuit of Fig. 15. An operational amplifier 142, capacitor elements 141 2 and 141 3, and switch circuits 140 5 to 140 8 are commonly used in D A converters 116 and 126 as in Fig. 15. A charge circuit for the D A converter 116 is constituted by the capacitor element 141 1 and switch circuits 140 1 to 140 4. A charge circuit for the D A converter 126 is constituted by the capacitor elements 141 4 and 141 5 and the switch circuits 140 9 to 140 14. In this manner, independent charge circuits are provided for D A converters 116 and 126, respectively. Quantizers 114 and 123 have a two bit resolution each. A quantized voltage from the quantizer 114 represents three values i.e., 0 and V A differentiator 125 is constituted by a delay circuit register 125 2 and an adder 125 1, and has a transfer function of 1 H₃₃ 1 Z ¹ . An output from the differentiator 125 represents one of the quantized voltage levels 0, V The frequency spectrum distribution characteristics of the analog signal output in Fig. 15 are substantially the same as those in Fig. 6. In this case, f The S N characteristics of the embodiment in Fig. 15 are substantially the same as those in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 exemplifies a case for f As is apparent from the S N characteristics in Fig. 7, the S N ratio is linearly changed as a function of the input signal amplitude level. These characteristics are substantially the same as those in a linear 15 bit A D converter. The S N ratio calculated by the previously mentioned equations is 90.8 dB, which substantially coincides with the S N ratio at the C dB input level in Fig. 7. According to the embodiments shown in Figs. 15 to 19, in the same manner as in the A D converters previously described, a plurality of quantization loops are used to perform multi stage quantization to greatly decrease the noise level in a low frequency bandwidth. Therefore, a very high S N ratio in the signal frequency bandwidth sufficiently lower than the sampling frequency f As is apparent from the embodiment in Fig. 15, although the analog circuit size is small, a relatively large number of digital circuits are used in the quantization loops. However, along with advances of IC micropatterning, the integration density of digital circuits is larger than that of analog circuits. Because of this, a digital circuit arrangement decreases the chip size and the present invention is thus suitable for integration circuits. As a result, a compact D A converter of high precision can be fabricated at low cost. The oversampling D A converters of the present invention have many unique advantages over those of the conventional D A converter in that conversion operation can be performed at a frequency much higher than the signal frequency. The present invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described above. Various changes and modifications may be made within the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, in the embodiment in Fig. 2, the output from the third loop differentiator 37 is supplied to the input side of the differentiator 26. However, the output from the differentiator 37 can be supplied to the adder 39 through another differentiator.
