## Description
PRESSURE SWITCHThis invention relates to pressure operated electrical switches of the type having a static contact co operable with a moving contact which is operated by a flexible diaphragm.Such switches are known in the art, and typical examples are to be found in GB A l537858 and GB A 2020908.GB A 1537858 shows the use of a metal diaphragm to actuate the moving contact, and while it is stated to be a compact device, it is apparently intended for use in vehicle brake systems, where pressures are high and tolerances are not particularly tight.Also, the contact arrangements do not seem to tend tbemselves o direct application to printed circuit boards.GB A 2020908 shows an arrangement in which the diaphragm operates through a snap disc and a switch bumper onto the moving contact.Such an arrangement is not particularly suitable for sub miniature circuitry, and the pressure to which the switch is snesitive is determined by the ratings of the snap disc and the diaphragm. The moving contact is spot welded onto a terminal, and its flexing is controlled to some extent by the provision of an arcuate cut out partially encircling the spot weld.It is an object of the invention to provide a pressure switch which is particularly compact and which can be readily adapted to operate over any of a wide spectrum of pressure ranges, by ready adaptation of the spring rate of the moving contact.In accordance with the invention, there is provided a sub miniature pressure switch for use with a printed circuit board, comprising a pressure chamber having one wall defined by a flexible diaphragm bearing upon a flexible and resilient moving contact electrically connected to a first conductor leg, and a static contact co operable with the said moving contact and connected to a second conductor leg, characterised in that the said moving contact is arranged to flex about a hinge line at least partially defined by at least one elongate cutout in the contact material, the section and width of the said cutout s being chosen to impart a desired spring rate to the moving contact.The moving contact may be manufactured in a number of models, giving a choice of cutout pattern, and the required cutout pattern is chosen in accordance with the intended use of the switch, and particularly the range of pressures it will meet in operation.The moving and static contacts are preferably integrally formed with the first and second conductor legs respectively, and the diaphragm should bear directly upon the moving contact for compactness.The cutout will normally be rectilinear.The effective position of the static contact may be adjustable by means of a setting screw adapted resiliently to deform a portion of the static contact towards the moving contact.The switch conveniently comprises a two part housing, in which the parts of the housing are crimped together with a periphery of the diaphragm trapped between them by means of a marginal bead received in a matching recess in one of the housing parts.The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings of preferred embodiments of pressure switches in accordance with the invention, and in which Figure 1 is an exploded sectional view of one form of switch in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is an assembled sectional view of the switch of figure 1 Figure 3 is a view similar to figure 2 and showing an alternative Figure 4 is a plan view of a blank for a moving contact, prior to bending to shape Figure 5 is a plan view of a blank for a static contact, prior to bending to shape Figure 6 is a bottom plan view of one part of a housing andFigure 7 is a plan view of another part of the housing.Turning first to figures 1 and 2, these show a housing having a base part 1 and a cover part 2, both of suitable insulating plastics material. A diaphragm 3 is trapped between the housing parts 1 and 2 by means of a marginal annular bead 4 received in a conforming recess 5 in the part 2 see also figure 7 . The housing part 2 defines, with the diaphragm 3, a pressure chamber 6 connected to a duct 7 the entrance to which is shown offset by 900 in figures 2 and 3 . The housing part 1 defines, also with the diaphragm 3, a contact chamber 8 see also figure 6 , which may also have a pressure conduit 9. Within the contact chamber 8 there are located static and moving contacts 11 and 12 respectively, each of slow moving spring metal, which may be gold or otherwise plated as required. An adjusting screw 13 for the static contact 11 is also illustrated. In the arrangement of figures 1 and 2, the contacts 11 and 12 are integral with conductor legs 14 and 15 respectively, and reference to figures 4 and 5 will show more detail of the constructions. The conductor legs are designed for compatibility with modern printed circuit boards so as to be soldered or fitted thereto. In particular, a dual in line arrangement is envisaged.The blank of figure 4 is permanently bent along the line shown dotted at 15b to form the angles 15a. An intermediate portion 16 is used to mount the component in the housing, and the moving contact 11 itself is connected to the intermediate portion 16 by a neck 17 which is provided with elongate rectilinear cutouts 18 which define a hinging or pivot line, and the location and dimensions of the cutouts 18 are so chosen that a predetermined spring rate is given to the moving contact 12. It is envisaged that movong contacts with a number of different configurations of cutouts 18 will be manufactured, and the mbving contact with the particular configuration required for a given application will be incorporated during assembly.The blank of figure 5 is permanently bent along the lines shown dotted at 21, 22 and 23 to form the angles 21a, 22a and 23a respectively. An anchoring intermediate portion is shown at 24, and the static contact itself is shown as having a centre zone 25 which acts as the contact zone and is displaceable by means of the adjusting screw 13 see figure 2 . The centre zone is defined by an elongate arcuate cut out 26 leaving a short hinging zone 27.The intermediate zones 16 and 24 are provided with apertures 16a and 24a which are engaged by contact posts 16b and 24b on the housing part 1 when the switch is assembled. The contact posts 16b and 24b are received in holes 16c and 24c respectively in the housing part 2. In the arrangement illustrated, there are a total of four contact posts, but in some cases, for use with lower pressures, two may be sufficient. In use, the two housing parts 1 and 2 are crimped together by any suitable means, with the diaphragm trapped sealingly between them. An excess pressure in chamber 6 will urge the diaphragm 3 upwards against the moving contact 12, which will flex, against the resilient resistance to hinging, about its hinging line defined by the cutouts 18 and move towards the static contact 11, and particularly the zone 25 thereof, as may be best seen in figure 2. The actual position of the zone 25 may be varied by the adjusting screw 13 to set the amount of hinging of the moving contact 12 required to make the switch. The minimum pressure differential required to achieve this movement is determined by the spring rate of the moving contact 12, which itself depends on the arrangement of the cutout s 18.In the description above, the contacts 11 and 12 have been shown and described as integral with their corresponding conductor legs 14 and 15. Figure 3 shows an arrangement in which the contacts co operate with separate conductor legs 31 which pass through and crimp the housing. Figure 3 is partially in section through one of these conductor legs, and shows another of them in elevation. The exact pressure ranges of operation will be determined by commercial requirements. The switching point will be chosen somewhere 0 and 100 of the range. Typical ranges which could be used are as follows Low 0 to 10 inches water gauge 338mb 0 to 50 inches water gauge 1688mb 0 to 100 inches water gauge 3377mb High 0 to 250 inches water gauge 8442mb .A maximum range would be about 0 to 150 pounds per square inch 10130mb .Various modifications may be made within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
