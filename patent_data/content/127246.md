# Capsule and rocket extraction system.

## Abstract
A capsule and rocket extraction system 10 for providing an inflight escape system for the pilot of a damaged aircraft. The system comprises a capsule 14 that is separable from the main fuselage 16 of the aircraft 12 and a rocket 18 for extracting the pilot from the capsule. A control system 24 is carried by the capsule for sensing the capsule s speed, altitude and attitude, and for actuating tonly the rocket to extract the pilot directly from the capsule when the speed, altitude and attitude are at predetermined conditions, and for sequentially actuating a capsule separation device to separate the capsule from the main fuselage and then actuating the rocket to extract the pilot from the separated capsule when the speed, altitude and attitude are at different predetermined conditions.
