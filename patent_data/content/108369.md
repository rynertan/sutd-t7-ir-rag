# Silicone hydraulic fluids and additive concentrates therefor.

## Abstract
Compositions are disclosed consisting essentially of A a polydiorganosiloxane fluid in which the organic radicals are predominantly or wholly methyl radicals B a chloren date diester C a lubricant compound which is an antimony or lead compound of a dialkyldithiocarbamate or dialkyl phosphorodithioate and D a block copolymer comprising blocks of polydi methylsiloxane and blocks of polybutadiene or hydrogenated polybutadiene. These compositions are useful as concentrates for replenishing polydiorgano siloxane hydraulic fluids that have become depleted in additives B and C . and as hydraulic fluids having im proved resistance to settling of the lubricant compound at low temperatures.
