# Method of and device for placing chip type electrical and or electronic components on a substrate.

## Abstract
A method of and a device for placing chip type compo ments 2 on a substrate 1 , in which a number of compo ments 2 are simultaneously picked up in presentation posi tions by means of a pick up device 10 which comprises a number of pick up elements 12 , after which the pick up de vice 10 is moved to a position over the substrate 1 and each of the pick up elements 12 in succession is moved to a position over the desired position on the substrate by movement of the pick up device and or the substrate with respect to one another, after which the relevant component is deposited and released in the relevant position by the pick up element.
