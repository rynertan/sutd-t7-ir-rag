# Delustering coating composition excellent in abrasion resistance.

## Abstract
A coating composition curable by an activation energy ray, which comprises a 100 parts by weight of a monomer mixture A comprising at least 30 by weight of a com pound having at least 3 acryloyloxy and or methacryloyloxy groups in the molecule and up to 70 by weight of a compound having 1 to 2 α,β ethylenically unsaturated bonds in the molecule, b 0.01 to 6.0 parts by weight of at least one photosensitizer and c 0.5 to 30 parts by weight of an emulsion type crosslinked polymer or copolymer of a reactive monomer having one α,β ethylenically unsaturated bond in the molecule and a reactive monomer having at least two α,β ethylenically unsaturated bonds in the molecule.
