# STRIP CHART RECORDERS

## Abstract
Novel strip chart recorders and strip chart recording paper are provided which are cooperable so that the recorder detects the proximity of a terminal edge of the paper, so that the recorder can signal this occurrence to the user enabling him to insert a new supply of strip chart paper in the recorder to avoid the loss of data. The recorder also cooperates with the strip chart paper to determine when paper is absent from the recorder, for example, when it has been exhausted, thereupon to signal this further occurrence to the user and take steps to avoid damage to the recorder which can result through its operation in the absence of paper in the recorder mechanism.
