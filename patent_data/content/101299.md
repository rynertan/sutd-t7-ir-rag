# Corrosion resistant aluminum electronic material.

## Abstract
A corrosion resistant aluminum material comprising an alloy containing aluminum as the principal component and, in addition, a small amount of a noble metal, the content of said noble metal being equal to or less than that at the eutectic point having the primary crystals of aluminum. As the noble metal, there is contained at least one metal selected from Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir, Os, Ru, Au and Ag. Said material is used for ball bonding wire and distributing film in a semiconductor device, and the like.
