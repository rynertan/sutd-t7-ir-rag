## Abstract
A process for forming a continuous filament yarn from a melt spinnable synthetic linear polymer and novel yarns of polyethylene terephthalate and yarns of polyhexamethylene adipamide produced by the process, the process comprising extruding the molten polymer through a shaped orifice to form a molten filamentary material, passing the molten filamentary material through a solidification zone 3 , passing the solidified filamentary material through a conditioning zone 5 provided with a gaseous atmosphere at a tempera ture above the glass transition temperature of the material and below its melting temperature, withdrawing the resulting filamentary yarn from the conditioning zone and winding up such yarn, characterised in that the gaseous atmosphere in the conditioning zone is compressed steam at an absolute pressure in excess of 136 kN m² and preferably, in the case of a yarn of polyethylene terephthalate, between 446 and 1176 kN m² and preferably, in the case of a yarn of polyhex amethylene adipamide, between 200 and 580 kN m².
