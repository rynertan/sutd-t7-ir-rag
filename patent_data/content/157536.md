# TELEPHONE LINE ACCESS SYSTEM FOR MAIN DISTRIBUTION FRAME

## Abstract
A system for accessing telephone lines at a main distribu tion frame includes an access block 44 positioned between a vertical input terminal block 28 and protector modules 42 of the distribution frame. The access block has a set of terminals 66, 68 which make direct connection between the corre sponding terminals 76, 74 of the input and protector modules and, in addition, includes a printed circuit with individual con ductors 60 coupled to respective ones of the access block ter minals. Multiplexing circuitry 50 connects with the printed circuit for sequential coupling of messages among the various telephone lines passing through the access block. Additional multiplexing circuitry is located on the distribution frame at a site remote from the input blocks and is coupled to the multi plexers associated with each of the input blocks to scan through the output signals of each of the multiplexers. The scanning operation also includes the operation of providing control and command signals to the multiplexers for sequenc ing through all of the telephone lines.
