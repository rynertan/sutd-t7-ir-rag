# Staging memory for massively parallel processor.

## Abstract
The invention herein relates to a computer organization 10 capable of rapidly processing extremely large volumes of data. A staging memory 12 is provided having a main portion consisting of a large number of memory banks 32 which are accessed in parallel to receive, store, and transfer data words simultaneous with each other. An address generator 40 is coded for accessing the data banks for receiving or transferring the appropriate words. Input and output permutation networks 34,38 arrange the lineal order of data into and out of the memory banks. The computer organization allows for an input output rate of data transfer on the order of 160 megabytes per second.
