# Stretched surface recording disk and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A support 12 for a stretched recording film 14 and method off attaching the film 14 to the support 12 . The support 12 includes a flat disk shaped base 16 , an annular upstanding rim 18 which terminates in a reference surface 20 , an annular radially extending bonding lip 22 which includes a bonding surface 24 inclined with respect to the plane of the base 16 , and a groove 26 separating the reference surface 20 and the bonding surface 24 . The method of attaching the film 14 to the support 12 includes deflecting the center of the base 16 to decrease the diameter of the bonding surface 24 , bonding the film 14 to the bonding surface 24 , and ceasing to deflect the base 16 so that the diameter of the bonding surface 24 increases to induce tension in the film 14 . A second protective layer of film 42 may be simultaneously stretched over and bonded to the first layer of film 38 .
