# AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL ARRANGEMENT USEFUL IN AN FM RADIO RECEIVER

## Abstract
In an FM receiver including a plurality of cascaded amp lifier stages 29, 31, 33 for successively amplifying an IF signal to form a pulse signal which is demodulated to derive an audio signal, an auxiliary amplifier 77,81 section coupled to one stage of the cascade is provided to amplify a signal developed at an intermediate point in the cascade to form a signal from which a control signal for controlling the gain of an RF amplifier can be derived. The auxiliary amplifier section includes a first linear amplifier 77 including degenerative signal feedback followed in cascade by a second linear amp lifier 81 including a gain control arrangement. The latter is responsive to a logarithmic gain control signal generated by a logarithmic amplifier 89 in response to the output signal of a peak detector 75 following the auxiliary amplifier 77,81 . The control signal has a relatively wide control range, e.g., 10 to 500 microvolts of RF input signal, suitable for controlling the gain of an RF stage.
