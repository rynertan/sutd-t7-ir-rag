## Description
SURFACTANTS DERIVED FROM UNDECYLENIC ACID,THEIR PREPARATION AND USES This invention relates to surfactants containing within the molecule at least one group derived from undecylenic acid.The surfactants are nonionic, having a lipophilic component which is the undecylenic group itself, and hydrophilic groups whichere a polyoxyalkylene chain, and perhaps hydroxy groups.BACKGROUND REFERENCES Polyethylene glycol mono esters of fatty acids including undecylenic acid are known Rao et al., Fats Oils Relat. FoodProducts Symposium 1976 published 1978 by Association of FoodService and Technology of India, Mysore, India . The methyl ether derivative of ethoxylated undecylenic acid is known from French Patent 1 522 750 The mono ethanolamide derivative of undecylenic acid has been ethoxylated to produce a fungicidal preparation BritishPatent No. 981 416 . Ester derivatives of such compounds with for example succinic acid are also known British Patent No. 1 018 302 . Undecylenic acid and its derivatives find use in cosmetic compositions, especially shampoos. While their precise activity against bacteria and fungi is not clearly established, undecylenic acid based compositions are ofter used where mild non specific bactericidal or fungicidal activity is sought. In the present invention, the undecylenic acid is contained in a compound which has surfactant and hence cleaning properties and is readily miscible with water.THE INVENTION The present invention provides surfactants which are alkoxylated polyhydric alcohol esters of undecylenic acid, containing 1 to n residues of undecylenic acid, the polyhytiric alcohol containing from 3 to 7 carbon atoms and, originally, n OH groups and where n is an integer and is at least 2. The invention also provides cosmetic compositions including shampoos containing surfactants of the type defined above. The surfactants may also be described as compounds of the general formulaEMI2.1 where R undecylenic acid residue R a C2 alkylene residue, optionally with substituents such as CH3 R is a hydrocarbon residue of polyhydric alcohol containing from 3 to 7 carbon atoms b is at least 1, preferably from 1 to 100 and may be different in different parts of the molecule c is from 1 to a maximum of n where n is the number of hydroxyl groups in the polyhydric alcohol referred to in the definition of R above, n being an integer and at least 2. Examples of Groups R are as the followingEMI2.2 OH2 OH2 n 4 n 4EMI2.3 n is preferably from 2 to 6. Examples of compounds falling within the scope of theEMI3.1 EMI3.2 x, y , w , z individually being, for example from O to 20 and x y w z being, for example from 10 to 40EMI3.3 EMI4.1 where x,y,w,z have, for example, the values specificed above.EMI4.2 The compounds can be prepared according to known methods for example the acid R COOH can be a esterified with a polyalkoxy ether of a polyhydric alcohol and optionally further alkoxylated.or b esterified with a polyhydric alcohol and subsequently alkoxylated. Alternatively a polyhydric alcohol can be first alkoxylated and the reaction product esterified with undecylenic acid. The compounds of the invention are surfactants and are useful in the preparation of skin and hair care products. They are particularly suitable for incorporation into shampoos. Preferred compounds for this purpose include a The alkoxylation products obtained by reacting one mole of undecylenic and with 2 to 20 moles ethylene oxide. b The products obtained by reacting one mole of undecylenic acid with one mole of a C3 C6 polyhydric alcohol like glycerol, 1,2 propylene glycol, sorbitol, 1,4 sorbitan, or 1, 5 sorbitan and by subsequent alkoxylation with 5 to 40 moles ethylene oxide. c The products obtained by reacting 2 to n moles of unde cylenic acid with a C3 C6 polyhydric alcohol containing n OH groups and by subsequent alkoxylation with 5 to 60 moles ethylene oxide.Incorporated into shampoo formulations at about 5 205 by weight of the total formulation, surfactants according to the invention have been shown to reduce the incidence of dandruff on some test subjects. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples. Example 1 Sorbitan monoundecylate 7, 96 kg and sodium hydroxide 50 g solid were charged to a reactor equipped with heater and stirrer.Ethylene oxide was supplied under pressure max. 3, 5 bar and the reactor heated to 180 50C, with stirring. The amount of ethylene oxide supplied 22. 04 kg was calculated to give 20 mols of ethoxy units per mol undecylenic. The product surfactant was recovered by vacuum treatment at 1200C after which 0,5 weight hydrogen per oxide was introduced at q60 C. After further vacuum treatment at 1200C, phosphoric acid 10 in weight inwater was added to adjust to pH 6 8. The product was filtered at 900C and the water content adjusted to 2. 5 3. 0 by weight at 70 C. The product was trasferred to containers. Example 2 Ethoxylated sorbitantriundecylenate was prepared by the procedure of Example 1 using the following quantities and conditions.The product had twenty ethoxy units per mole of sorbitan triundecy lenate Sorbitantriundecylenate 5 Kg Sodium hydroxide 23 Kg Ethylene oxide 6, 73 Kg Reaction temperature 160 5 C Maximum reaction pressure 3, 5 bar
