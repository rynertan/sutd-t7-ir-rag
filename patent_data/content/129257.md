# HEAT EXCHANGER

## Abstract
A heat pipe apparatus incorporated in a heat exchanger comprises an evaporative pipe group 16 disposed within a flow G₁ of a heating fluid, a condenser pipe group 20 located away from the evaporative pipe group 16 , a passage 18 for connecting both pipe groups and for circulating there through a working medium, another passage 24 branching off from the connecting passage, and at least one another condenser pipe group 26 associated with the another pas sage. The condenser pipe group 20 and the another con denser pipe group 26 are disposed within two flows G₂, G₃ of fluid to be heated so as to heat them.
