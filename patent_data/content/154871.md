# ONE TRANSISTOR DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY

## Abstract
In a semiconductor memory having memory cells, a groove 17 is formed in a semiconductor substrate 10 , and a semiconductor layer 20 is charged into said groove 17 via an insulating film 18 to form a capacitor electrode. The semi conductor layer 20 stretches on the insulating film 11 formed on the semiconductor substrate 10 and comes into contact with the substrate 10 passing through a hole formed in the insulating film 11 thereby to form a base portion of a switching MOS transistor. The source and drain regions 151, 152 of the transistor are formed on said semiconductor layer on the insulating film 11 .
