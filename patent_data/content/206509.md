# POLY ARYL ETHER KETONES CONTAINING SULPHUR

## Abstract
Compositions comprising a between 0.1 to 5 sulfur present as at least one member of the class consisting of elemental sulfur, aliphatic and aromatic dithiols, polymeric oxida tion products thereof comprising repeat units of the formula R S S where R is a bivalent aliphatic or aromatic radical and inorganic sulphides by weight and b a poly aryl ether ketone useful because of their high tensile modulus, high temperature adhesive properties, and dimensional stability. In a further embodiment the composition further contains a reinforcing filler such as glass or carbon fibers. In a further embodiment the composition may be made into fibers or used as adhesives.
