# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BUTT WELDING OF PLASTIC PIPES OF LARGE DIAMETER

## Abstract
The welding apparatus serves for the purpose of butt welding of plastic pipes of diameters larger than 500 mm. All the work is performed by means of the welding apparatus from inside the pipe. Thereby the working time is reduced, the welding quality ensured, and the installation becomes faster. Lifting cranes and heating tents become unneces sary. A novelty is also the possibility of welding pipes together at an angle position. As the welding apparatus is collapsible, it may also be advantageously used for repair work on old pipes in the ground relining , with a minimum exposure of the pipes.
