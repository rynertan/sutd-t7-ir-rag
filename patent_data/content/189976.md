# EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT, FLEXIBLE SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE ARRAYS AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
An extremely lightweight, interconnected array of semi conductor devices, such as solar cells, is formed from a large continuous area of semiconductor material 3, 23, 43, 83, 123 disposed on an unconventonally thin, electrically con ducting stubstrate 1, 21, 41, 81, 121 . The interconnections are formed by removing portions of the substrate to form substrate islands 13, 35, 55, 95, 141, 163, 183 underlying a layer of semiconductor material which underlies a transpa rent conductive oxide 5, 25, 45, 83, 125, 179 . The oxide layer may likewise be formed into mutually isolated islands 7, 29, 47, 89, 131, 181 that overlay the areas between the substrate islands. Individual units or cells so formed may be intercon nected by depositing a conducting material on, alongside and at least partially between islands of oxide and or semiconductor, by depositing a metal grid 27 on the oxide layer and burning conducting paths 31 to the substrate islands, or by piercing the layers and disposing a conducting material in the holes 133 pierced. The unconventionally thin substrate may be a sheet of electroformel nickel or other thin metal or may be an initially thick substrate that is thinned by chemical etching after other array processing steps are completed. To maximize the output power to weight ratio of a solar cell array, the conventional substrate 159, 171 may be removed entirely. In that process, a dissimilar layer 161, 173 , such as a back reflector, is deposited on a support, such as a conventional substrate, before the semiconductor material 23, 177 is deposited. After all other processing, the support 159, 171 is removed by chemical etching to produce a substrateless array of devices. Typically, the array is encapsulated by a protective glass or polymer film. An encapsulant 33 is preferably applied to the exposed surface of the semiconduc tor material to protect it while the substrate is being thinned or removed. Subsequently, an encapsulant 37 is applied to the rear of substrate side of the array. An insulating layer 173 may be interposed between the support 171 and semiconductor layer 177 and act to encapsulate the rear of a substrateless array when the support is etched away to produce an ultimate power to weight ratio array.
