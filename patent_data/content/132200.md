# Electro optical gap and flushness sensor.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the electro optically based sen sor units of use in measuring the fit up of panels as on car bodies, aircraft, etc. The disclosed invention is capable of measuring both the gap between the adjacent panels and their relative positions, or flushness , in the direction out of plane. Embodiments include a hand held portable unit cap able of being used on finished assemblies such as car bodies, and aircraft sections, as well as on ring gages in which a single test panel is checked relative to a reference frame or ring .
