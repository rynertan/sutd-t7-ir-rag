## Description
The present invention relates to a shampoo composition. More particularly, the invention relates to a shampoo composition based on an anionic surfactant, to which a sucrose fatty acid ester surfactant and a nonionic cellulose ether derivative are incorporated which forms smooth, creamy foams during shampooing, making smooth combing possible after shampooing and preventing shampooed, dried hair from becoming fly away . Ordinary shampoo compositions are based on an anionic surfactant such as a salt of an alkyl sulfate or polyoxyethylenealkyl sulfate a nonionic surfactant such as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether or fatty acid alkylolamide or an amphoteric surfactant such as an alkylbetaine or alkylamine oxide, alone or in the form of a mixture. However, such shampoo compositions tend to remove sebaceous matters and other oils excessively from hair, which worsens the feel of the shampooed hair and makes smooth combing or brushing impossible. Furthermore, hair cannot be set easily after drying. Particularly in winter, in which the humidity in air is low, hair acquires a static charge by brushing causing it to fly away , as a result, the hair is kinked and combing and brushing are made more difficult. This results in the hair splitting or breaking. To overcome these disadvantages, an oil or the like is incorporated in the shampoo base. However, the amount of such additive is limited and, usually they remain emulsified or solubilized with a surfactant in the shampoo, and, therefore, it is difficult to leave a sufficient amount of the oil on the scalp and hair. Additionally, when the oil is used in a large amount, the essential functions of the shampoo, i.e. foaming and deterging powers, are extremely reduced damaging the commercial value of the shampoo seriously, though the amount of the oil absorbed on the hair is increased. Though various shampoo compositions containing a cationic polymer, so as to exhibit a rinsing effect on the shampooed hair have been proposed recently, the shampooed hair has often a greasy touch under wet conditions, also it has a sticky touch and causes flaking under dry conditions. Patent Abstracts of Japan GB A 2140452 describes a shampoo based on more than 0.1 wt. of a sugar alcohol acrylic ester where the ester is a mono or diester of a C ₁₀ to C ₁₈ sugar. After intensive investigations made for the purpose of developing a shampoo composition which does not cause the kinking of hair during shampooing, thus facilitating shampooing, and which has conditioning effects to make smooth combing of the shampooed hair possible and to smoothen hair by overcoming the disadvantages of the conventional shampoo compositions, the inventors have found that, when a specific sucrose fatty acid ester surfactant and a specific nonionic cellulose ether derivative are incorporated in an ordinary shampoo base selected from anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants excluding sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants , cationic surfactants and amphoteric surfactants, smooth creamy foams can be formed during shampooing, entanglement can be prevented facilitating shampooing, and conditioning can be obtained to smoothen the shampooed hair and to prevent the sticky touch after drying. The present invention has been completed on the basis of this finding. The present invention provides a shampoo composition comprising from 5 to 30 percent by weight of a shampoo base component, characterised in that it also includes A conventional surfactant is used as the shampoo base component. Some examples thereof are listed below. Among the above mentioned shampoo bases, particularly preferred are anionic surfactants such as salts of straight chain or branched alkyl sulfates having 10 to 16 carbon atoms on average salts of polyoxyethylene alkyl sulfates in which the alkyl group has 8 to 20 carbon atoms on average average molar number of addition 0.5 to 8 alkyl phosphates having 8 to 16 carbon atoms on average and salts of olefinsulfonic acids having 10 to 16 carbon atoms on average nonionic surfactants such as higher fatty acid mono or dialkanolamides in which the alkyl group has 10 to 14 carbon atoms and amphoteric surfactants of alkylamine oxide, alkylbetaine and imidazoline types. The above mentioned shampoo bases may be used either alone or in the form of a mixture of two or more of them and their concentration is 5 to 30 by weight all percentages given hereinafter are by weight , preferably 10 to 25 , based on the shampoo composition. The amount of the sucrose fatty acid ester used in the present invention is 0.1 to 10 , preferably 0.2 to 5 , based on the shampooo composition. Examples of the preferred nonionic cellulose ether derivatives of the above general formula 2 used as the component B in the present invention include hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and methylcellulose. Of the above mentioned cellulose derivatives, hydroxyethylcellulose is available on the market under the name of Cellosize Union Carbide Corp. or NatrosoI Hercules . To attain the object of the present invention, those in which 1.0 to 4.0, particularly 1.8 to 3.0, molecules of ethylene oxide is added per glucose residue are preferred. It is preferable that methylcellulose has a content, based on the total weight of OR4, OR5 and OR6 in the formula 2 , of methoxy group methylation extent in the range of 10 to 40 wt. , particularly 20 to 30 wt. . Hydroxypropylcellulose is preferred to have a content of hydroxypropoxy group to the same effect at 1 to 20 wt. , preferably 5 to 15 wt. . The nonionic cellulose ether compound B may have any of R4, R5 and R6 at either terminals of the molecule having the formula 2 . The component B may be used, mixed with another nonionic cellulose ether compound of the formula 2 . The component B is used in an amount of 0.05 to 5 wt. , preferably 0.1 to 2 wt. . The form of the composition of the present invention must be paste or liquid containing water as the medium. The amount of water is preferably 40 to 90 and the pH of the liquid is preferably 4 to 8. The shampoo composition of the present invention may contain, in addition to the above mentioned indispensable components, other known constituents of shampoos such as solubilizers, e.g., propylene glycol, glycerol or urea, viscosity modifiers, e.g., ethanol, inorganic salts, higher alcohols or polyacrylic acids, perfumes, colorants, U.V. absorbers, antioxidants, dandruff removers, sterilizers and antiseptics. The following examples will further illustrate the present invention, and by no means limit the invention. In the following examples, the properties of the shampoos were evaluated as follows 30 g of human hair was wet with water 40 C to impregnate it with 20 g of water. Then, the hair was shampooed with 1 g of a shampoo composition and the feel of the foams was judged by 20 female panelists organoleptically. The easiness of passing the fingers through hair during shampooing was shown in terms of slippiness of foams and the appearance of the foams was evaluated from the viewpoint of creaminess . 30 g of human hair was shampooed by shaking in 10 cc of an aqueous solution of a shampoo composition concentration 10 for about 30 sec, then rinsed in running water for 1 min, squeezed and arranged on a strain gauge. The hair was combed and the force required for the combing was measured wet test . Separately, the hair rinsed in running water was squeezed, dried with a dryer and left to stand in an air conditioned room at 25 C overnight while the relative humidity was kept at 65 and the hair was arranged on the strain gauge. The hair was combed and the force required for the combing was measured dry test . The lower the load, the easier the combing. A change of the hair by the static electricity in the dry test of the easiness of combing was observed macroscopically. Shampoo compositions as shown in Table 1 were prepared by an ordinary process and the effects of the indispensable components were examined to obtain the results shown in Table 1. A shampoo composition as shown below was prepared and the effects of various sucrose fatty acid surfactants were examined to obtain the in Table 2. A shampoo composition as shown below was prepared and the effects of various nonionic cellulose ether derivatives were examined to obtain the results shown in Table 3.
