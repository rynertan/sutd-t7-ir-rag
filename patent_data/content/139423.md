# A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF HIGH PURITY HYDROGEN

## Abstract
In the production of hydrogen by the catalytic decom position of methanol and the subsequent purification thereof by removing carbon oxides inevitably formed as a by product by catalytically converting them into methanol, optionally after a preliminary removal by other means, an improved overall economy is obtained by recycling the methanol formed so as to combine it with the feedstock of methanol.
