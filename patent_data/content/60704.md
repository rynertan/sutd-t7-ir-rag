# A steering system.

## Abstract
A steering system hydraulics actuators 12, 13 for steering wheels 36, 37 are mechanically linked via steering arms 30, 31 and a connecting link 34 . The actuators comprise cylinders 24, 25 , pistons 14, 15 and hollow piston rods 16, 17 . The actuators are operated in single acting manner by connection of their head chambers 22, 23 only to a directional control valve 42 which is control led between three positions by the pressure differential across two hydraulic control lines 50, 51 . These lines are connected from a manually operated metering pump 52 . Feedback connections to the lines 50, 51 are made from first feedback chambers 24, 25 on the rod sides of the pistons 14, 15 . In order to overcome problems arising from differential piston velocities, the invention provides addi tional connections 46, 49 from second feedback chambers 26, 27 in the hollow piston rods. The second feedback chambers change volume in opposite sense to the first feedback chambers and are oppositely connected to the control lines 50, 51 .
