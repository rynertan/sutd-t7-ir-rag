# MINEHUNTING AND DISPOSAL SYSTEM

## Abstract
The present invention relates to minehunting and disposal systems. Known methods of minehunting and disposal comprise the deployment of several relatively large ships each having a crew of the order of thirty personnel. The known ships are expensive since they have to be specially fabricated so as to present a low magnetic signature and low noise generation. This invention provides a system comprising a par ent ship providing support facilities for a plurality of operational craft 10, 12, 14, 16 , the operational craft 10, 12, 14, 16 being relatively small and being provided with known mine detection and destruction equipment 34 . The parent ship is preferably designed and equip ped so as to be capable of carrying the operational craft 10, 12, 14, 16 on board, such that the operational craft may be transported to the area of deployment. The operational craft 10, 12, 14, 16 preferably have hulls 16 providing a substantial portion of its buoyancy sub merged together with a relatively small water plane area, for example a Small Water Plane Area Twin Hull type craft. This system reduces the number of personnel ex posed to a single risk and the operational craft present a low magnetic signature and low noise generation due to their size and these endowments are particularly enhanced if the preferred form of hull 16 is utilised.
