# Improvements relating to the lining of passageways and pipelines.

## Abstract
The present invention provides that in the lining of a pipeline or passageway using a flexible lining comprising a resin absorbent felt, the felt is impregnated with a light curing resin, and light radiation is used for effecting the resin cure. The resin and felt are selected so as to be of a similar refractve index, and so that the resin and fibres are substantially transparent to the curing light radiation which is used. The lining is pre impregnated and then contained a bag, envelope or sachet of opaque material to prevent it from curing prematurely.
