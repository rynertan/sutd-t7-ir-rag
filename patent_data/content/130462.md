# PRINTED CIRCUITS

## Abstract
Described herein is a composite structure comprising a a solid dielectric support surface b a layer or pathway com prising a thermoset resin and containing sufficient electrically conductive metal particles, in the configuration of at least an electric circuit element, to provide desired properties and pref erably to satisfy the Soldering Standard Test hereinafter de fined and preferably to provide an electric circuit element hav ing a low surface resistivity of 0.1 ohm per square or less. Also described are inks for printed circuit devices, circuit transfer means, and methods for making the same.
