# Improvements in or relating to antenna array circuits.

## Abstract
The arrangement is for canceling unwanted sidelobes in travelling wave arrays, especially the back lobe 5 where the main beam 4 approaches the end fire direction the array should have high symmetry, ie, with the usual form of array radiators spaced along a single feeder , the radiation patterns when fed from either end should be mirror images. Cancellation is obtained by having feed connections 2, 2 at both ends of this form of array 1 , the feed at one end being attenuated 8 relative to the other and effectively subtracted 6 therefrom. In RF form, for receiving or trans mitting, the subtraction can be effected by phase reversing 7 the signal in one of the feed connections. In baseband form, suitable for receiving only, diodes are included in both feed connections and subtraction performed at baseband frequency.
