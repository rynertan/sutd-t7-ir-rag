## Description
METHOD AND MEANS FOR ENHANCEMENT OF IN VIVO ANTI CANCER DRUG THERAPY METHOD AND MEANS FOR ENHANCEMENT OF IN VIVO ANTI CANCER DRUG THERAPYBackground of the Invention This invention relates to the treatment of an intact animal organism bearing a neoplastic process, and more particularly to varieties of treatment involving drug use. In particular, the invention pertains to controlled modification of cell and or tissue behavior during such treatment, by the application of electrical information which may be regarded as encoded. More particularly, the invention provides for the intracellular application, via surgically non invasive direct inductive coupling, of one or more electrical voltage and concommitant current signals which modify a fundamental behavioral function of the cells and or tissues, in the context of drug treatment of a cancer affliction. Attempts have been made in the past to elicit a response of living cells and or tissue to electrical signals. Much of this work is reviewed and discussed in Ryaby, et al. U.S. Patent No.4,105,017, particularly insofar as such responses have been elicited in osteogenetic cell and or tissue behavior.Reference is made to said patent for extensive background discussion. We have discovered that certain beneficial modifications of cell and or tissue behavior may be specifically and selectively induced in an intact animal organism bearing a neoplastic process, the induction being via electromagnetic coupling using apparatus and techniques having much in common with that disclosed in said patent and in pending Ryaby, et al. application Serial No. 887,485, filed March 17, 1978.Brief Statement of the Invention It is an overall object of the invention to provide a method and means for prolonging the lifeexpectancy of an intact animal organism bearing a neo plastic process. It is a specific object to achieve the above object in aid of drug treatment by eliciting, via electromagnetic coupling, one or more specifically modified cell and or tissue responses within the animal organism. Another specific object is to provide a method and means for prolonging life expectancy in a chemotherapy treatment of cancer, beyond the normal expectation from chemotherapy alone. The e foregoing objects and various further features of novelty are achieved by the invention, wherein behavior of living host and or cancer cells is altered, to the benefit of the host, by electromagnetically inducing therein low level voltage and concommitant current pulses of specific timefrequency amplitude relations. More particularly, by controlled application of excitation levels and repetition rates of such pulses, it is found that a significant increase in life expectancy is identifiable for cases involving drug treatment of cancer.Detailed Description The e invention will be illustratively described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a simplified view in perspective, to show electromagnetic apparatus of the invention, adapted for therapeutically beneficial operation upon one or more intact animal organisms afflicted with a neo plastic process Fig. 2 is a vertical sectional view through a midsection of the apparatus of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is an electrical block diagram schematically showing means for exciting the apparatus of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a waveform diagram to illustrate operation of the apparatus when thus excited Fig. 5 is a computer rinted graph statistically presenting observed life expectancy, involving use of the invention, on a comparative basis with nonuse of the invention Fig. 6 is a simplified graphical display of tumor size, as a function of time, the display being in aid of discussion of possible explanation for observed results. Fig. 7 is a diagram to illuminate discussion of dual coil placement considerations and Fig. 8 is a diagram similar to Fig. 7 to illustrate single coil placement considerations and Figs. 9, 10 and 11 are simplified views in perspective to show further structural embodiments. In Figs. 1 and 2, one or more intact animal organisms to be subjected to the method of the invention are housed within an open box like container 10 of non paramagnetic material, and the container is removably positionable upon a supporting shelf which is the lower one of two vertically spaced parallel plates 11 12 of non paramagnetic material. Corner columns 13 rigidly space plates 11 12 to the extent H1, which exceeds the height H2 of container 10, to allow fresh air access to contained animal organisms. Feet 14 establish an offset between the lower plate 11 and a supporting table not shown , for protection of a lower electrical coil 15 that is secured to the underside of the lower plate 11. A duplicate electrical coil 16 is secured to the upper surface of the upper plate 12, in vertical registry with lower coil 15.Coils 15 16 are connected in flux aiding relation, being shown parallel connected and served by flexiblecable means 17 for supply by a source of excitation, to be described in connection with Fig. 3. In the form shown, the container 10 is characterized by a square base and arrangement of sidewalls, of horizontal length L1 and spaced guide rails 18 and a back stop 19 on the upper surface of plate 11 assure accurate removable central placement of container 10 on its shelf plate 11 and with respect to the coils 15 16, when animal organisms within the container are exposed for treatment. Each of the plates 11 12 is square, of horizontal length L2 and each of the coils 15 16 is essentially square, of inside horizontal length L3.The volume of container 10 is preferably sized and positioned on shelf 11 so as to enclose all cells and or tissues to be treated, within the geometrical volume defined by and between the coils 15 16 also, the spacing H3 between coils 15 16 is preferably less than the effective diameter of the respective coils, as will later be explained in connection with Fig. 7. Since the particular coils 15 16 in Fig. 1 are square, their effective diameter may be approximated by the peripheral extent of the square 4 x L3 , divided by 77. Referring to Fig. 3, a variable d c supply 30 is coupled through gate means 32 to the treatment coil 22 or coils, as the case may be and as will more fully appear below in conjunction with the apparatus of Fig. 1, the coil s 22 of Fig. 3 will be understood to symbolize connection to the line 17 which serves coils 15 and 16. The gate 32 is under the control of control units 34 36, which cause a pulse signal consisting of repetitive pulses of electrical potential to be applied to the coil means 32. Each pulse cycle, as shown in Fig. 4, is composed of a pulse portion P1 of first polarity followed by a pulse portion P2 of opposite polarity.The control units 34 36 may typically be monostable multivibrators, e.g., to generate appropriate timing signals, and they may be variable to control pulse duration and repetition rate within desired limits, while the use of a variable d c supply 30 permits variation of the pulse signal amplitude as desired. With the pulse generator apparatus thus far described, the output signal for coil excitation is in what has been described as Mode 1, being a steady succession of asymmetrical voltage pulses, the asymmetry being attributable to different time constants and being characterized first pulses P1 of lesser amplitude V1 and greater duration T1, as compared with second pulses P2 of greater amplitudeV2 and lesser duration T2, there being a dwell T3 between successive pulse cycles, depending upon circuit constants. The Mode 1 signal will produce cell modulating effects, but we have thus far found a pulse train burst segment or Mode 2 excitation signal to be preferred for present purposes. When pulse train operation Mode 2 is employed additional timing circuitry similar to units 34 and 36 is employed to define the burst segment duration and the burst segment repetition rate. As shown, control units 35 37 control gate 33 to produce a coil excitation signal of the described asymmetrical nature, but wherein the control units 35 37 determine the number of pulses in a burst and the time T4 between successive bursts of pulses. It has been found that the signal across the treatment coil or coils, and hence the induced signal within cells and or tissue under treatment, should satisfy certain criteria. These criteria will be specified with respect to the signal as induced in the cells under treatment. Such induced signal may be monitored, if desired, by use of an auxiliary monitoring probe or pickup coil not shown which is positioned at a distance from the coils A B corresponding to the distance of the cells and or tissue under treatment from such coils, as is explained in detail in said patent. It suffices here to state that a typical pickup coil that has been employed is circular, about one half centimeter in diameter, and with about 67 or 68 turns of small gauge enamel coated wire.The potential developed by the coil is divided by the length of the wire in centimeters to provide an induced voltage per centimeter number that is closely related to the volts centimeter induced in the cells and or tissue under treatment. EXAMPLE In order to determine life prolonging efficacy in application of the invention to an intact animal organism bearing a neoplastic process, ten identical structures as described in connection with Figs. 1 and 2 were identically prepared, each for containment of five BDF1 mice, being a standard commercially available in bred species. The mice came from a total collection of 80 BDF1 females, 15 of which 1 constituted a control group and were identically accommodated, in groups of five, in separate dummy containers, identical to the structure described inFigs.l and 2, except for the absence of coils 15 16.Care was taken that each container 10 provided identical housing, food supply and water availability for the mice of all batches, the containers being lined with sawdustr The containers 10 were 7.5 inches square L1 , by 3.5 inches high H2 , and plates 11 12 were 1 8 inch thick. The inside span L3 of the coils was 8.5 inches, and there spaced 4 inches H3 . Each of the coils thus defined a 34 inch perimeter, having an effective diameter on the underside of 11 inches, being defined by 20 turns of No. 15 enamel coated copper wire.Coil excitation with the circuit of Fig. 3 provided a probemeasured first polarity pulse amplitude V1 of 0.16mv in tissue and duration T1 of 250 u sec., and a secondpolarity pulse amplitude V2 of 1.6mv in tissue and duration T2 of 4 u sec., with a short dwell T3 of about 4 u sec. between pulses. Bursts of 50 milliseconds were administered concurrently to each electromagnetically treated batch, at a burst repetition rate of 2 Hz, and the pattern was maintained for the same twelve hours of each day. A test program was followed to determine the interaction of the described electromagnetic excitation with cytotoxic combination chemotherapy, and to determine such interaction in reference to such excitation alone i.e. without chemotherapy and in reference to the chemotherapy along i.e. without electromagnetic excitation . All eighty mice were initially prepared with B16 melanoma, at a tumor diamter of 5.5mm upon initiation of a seven day period of different treatment and no treatment circumstances as follows a The mice in three dummy containers, serving as controls , were subjected to no chemo therapy and to no electromagnetic excitation. b The mice in the remaining three dummy containers were subjected to combination chemotherapy, but to no electromagnetic excitation the chemotherapy involved i at 11.30 a.m., and on the first day only, an intraperitoneal injection of methylcyclohexyl chloroethylnitrosourea, 18mg kg, meaning that each mouse was weighed and given 18mg of the drug, per kg of body weight, and ii at noon, of days 1 through 7, inclusive, a similar injection of cyclophosphamide, 12mg kg. c The mice in the containers of five coil equipped devices per Figs. 1 and 2 were subjected to electromagnetic excitation, but no chemotherapy the electromagnetic excitation was pursuant to the above described pulse burst pattern, commencing at 12.30p.m. on each of the seven days of chemotherapy treatment, and continuing for the next 12 hours of each day. d The mice in the containers of the remaining five coil equipped devices per Figs.l and 2 were subjected to both i the combination chemotherapy of Item b above, and ii the electromagnetic excitation therapy of Item c above. Taking initiation of the treatments as the origin of a time base, expressed in days of palpable growth, the observed results of the foregoing program are graphically presented in Fig. 5, in terms of the surviving fractional number of mice, at each applicable day. In Fig. 5, the curve A depicts observation of the controls group, Item a above curve B depicts observation of the group receiving only combination chemotherapy, Item b above and curve C depicts observation of the group receiving both combination chemotherapy and electromagnetic therapy, Item d In all cases involving electromagnetic excitAtion therapy, the indicated pattern of excitation was repeated until all mice died, i.e. during and after the period of chemotherapy administration. above it being noted that the group receiving only electromagnetic therapy was not observed to survive significantly different from the controls group, so that no curve in Fig. 5 appears for the group ofItem c above. It is seen from the curves of Fig. 5 that the median survival of no treatment controls mice was 27 days, that the median survival of mice treated with combination chemotherapy along was 36 days, and that the medial survival of mice treated with both combination chemotherapy and electromagnetic therapy was 45 days. At the present time, it is not possible to account definitively for the observed extension of life expectancy achieved through electromagnetic therapy inconjunction with chemotherapy, but Fig. 6 is a simplified presentation of growth curves which will aid a discussion of possible mechanisms that are operative. The solid line curve 40 depicts the controls case, wherein the 27 day median expectancy intercept is identified and the solid line curve 41 depicts the case of the combined chemotherapy alone, wherein the 36 day median expectancy intercept is identified. The above described experiment for the two cases conformed substantially to what had previously been established, as to both growth size and median expectancy for this reason, these solid curves 40 41 provide a good base for discussion of possible mechanism to explain the newly discovered means of extension to 45 days.Of course, the fact that only 25 mice were subject to both the combined chemotherapy and the electromagnetic therapy, and the further obsservation that at death the tumor size wad different for different animals, means that insufficient evidence exists with which to plot a median tumor size at death thus in Fig.6, two different size intercepts at 45 days are identified, at points 45 and 46, respectively. First, it should be noted that the curve 41 for combined chemotherapy alone is generally parallel to the controls curve 40, at approximately 10 day offset therefrom, but that curve 41 begins as a perturbation characterized by downward departure from curve 40 this initial down slope reflects characteristic regression in the growth of the tumor cells through killing tumor cells and possible augmentation of host response and the subsequent rise in the curve reflects characteristic regrowth of the tumor.To account for a size denoted at point 45 for the observed 45 day expectancy, it is believed that addition of the electromagnetic therapy to the combined chemotherapy may produce a further offset of the regrowth curve, by reason of extended regression prior to regrowth in other words, the electromagnetic therapy may so stimulate host cells as to enable the chemotherapy to have greater cell killing effectiveness. Such a situation is depicted by dashed line curve 47. It is also possible that the regrowth curve following such extended regression is not as steep as depicted by curve 47, in which case the slower rate of regrowth not shown may result in the lessersize point 46 at the 45 day expectancy intercept. Still further, the point 46 is shown in Fig.6 to be identified with a lesser slope regrowth curve 48, following the regression which is known to be identified with combination chemotherapy alone in this event, it is reasoned that the electromagnetic therapy is operative to inhibit regrowth of the tumor, as by so coupling to the host body cells that they are better able to fight the regrowth. Further in reference to Fig. 6, the point 45 is seen to indicate death at the 45 day intercept and for a tumor size considerably larger than what is to be expected 36 day intercept of curve 41 for the case of the chemotherapy alone. It is reasoned that in this event, the achievement of point 45, whether via curve 41 or via curve 47, may be attributable to the electromagnetic therapy so beneficially coupling to the host body cells that they increase the tolerance of the host body to the burden of a larger tumor. Still further, where death may be attributed to toxity of the administered drugs, it is reasoned that the observed extended life expectancy may be due to the electromagnetic therapy so beneficially coupling to the host body cells as to effectively decrease the toxicity of the drugs involved. And if this and or any of other above noted beneficial results of electromagnetic excitation of host body cells is correct, then it is further possible that such excitation of host body cells can reduce the metastatic potential of the tumor, i.e. reduce any capacity of the tumor to spread to non contiguous regions of the host. In the above described structure and experimental example, it is considered important that the electromagnetic therapy shall involve exposure of entire animal organisms to substantially uniform and uniformly distributed orientated magnetic flux. This is for the reason that the indicated drug treatment necessarily spreads throughout the body, and it is believed that all host cells should be electromagnetically coupled to perform one or more of their beneficial functions, such as combatting tumor growth, increasing host resistance to drug toxicity, etc. The point as to substantially uniform and uniformly distributed oriented flux development will be briefly discussed in connection with the pair of circular coils A B ofFig. 7. On an elemental basis, it is convenient to consider the circular coil situation depicted inFig. 7, wherein like circular coils A B of inside diameter D1 are positioned on a common central axis of symmetry, at parallel planes which are spaced apart by the distance S, and wherein the coils A B are excited in flux aiding relation. If the spacing S is sufficiently small in relation to the diameter D1, then substar.tially all flux lines within coils A B will extent continuously therebetween, on a generally straight alignment which may even neck down,as suggested by the profile 50. If the spacing S is greater again in relation to the diameter D1 , some stray flux lines 51 will develop, to the detriment of the development of uniform high density flux in the central span S. Generally,in view of the necking down 50 , and in view of the treatment zone being generally at the centre span S, it is convenient to consider the coils A B as being desirably effective in producing the uniform flux distribution over an imaginary cylinder 52 of diameter D2, tangent to the neck down profile 50. From experience to date, it can be stated that for body cell application of the character presently described, the span S should be equal to or less than the diameter D1, and of course D2 the effective diameter of the zone of body cell treatment will always be considerably less than D1, being substantially equal to D1 only when coils A B are closely adjacent.As a practical consideration in the application of dual coils to an animal organism specimen or batch, it is believed that the nominal inside diamter D1 of the coils should be at least 1.5 times the diameter D2 of the effective cell treatment zone, and this has been found to be a reliable approach for coil spacing S substantially equal to the inside diameter D1. Further applications, method and structures of the invention will be indicated in discussion of the successive embodiments of Figs. 8 to 10. In fig.8, a large simple multiturn coil 55 is shown, in the schematic style adopted for the discussion of the two spaced coils A B of Fig. 7 The coil 55 happens to be shown as circular, but this is only for purposes of simplified discussion of principle. The coil 55 is shown to have an inside diameter Dmax. r establishing essentially a central plane the plane of the coil through which all flux lines must be confined, in response to coil excitation at this plane, flux distribution is essentially uniform and orientated perpendicular to the plane, i.e., parallel to the central axis of the coil.Outside this plane, the lines of the magnetic field bloom axially and radically outwardly, to develop generally toroidally about the coil but, at least for a shallow axial offset, of extent L5, a region exists wherein the orientation and distribution of magnetic flux is useful for the therapeutic purposes of the invention. The geometrical solid within which such useful flux is available is schematically indicated by the generally conically tapering contour 56, reducing from May. at the central plane of coil 55, to a minimum useful diameter Dmin. at the offset L5.The single multiturn coil 55, excited as described for the circuit of Fig. 3, may have utility in treatment of tumors which by their nature are essentially confined near a surface locale of the animal organism to be treated. Of course, the size and placement of the coil 55 on the body should be such that the afflicted region is contained within the offset geometrical volume between contour 56 and the plane of the coil. Utility also exists for an arrangement as in Fig. 10, discussed below. Fig. 9 illustrates apparatus useful in applying electromagnetic therapy to an entire human body and is thus indicated for use with chemotherapy, analogous to the situation in the foregoing illustrative example.A large tubular shell 60 extends longitudinally for essentially the length L6 of a bed mattress 61 which, with its supporting platform 62 is fully contained within the lower semi cylindrical half of the volume within the shell 60. Longitudinal frame members 63 provide means of stabilizing support for platform 62 with respect to the enclosure of shell 60, and will be understood also to derive floo based reference from suitable outer frame structure not shown it will be further understood that all structural elements 60, 61, 62, 63 are of non paramagnetic materials. Importantly, electrical coil means, which may be uniformly spaced turns of a single coil 64, are mounted to and developed along the cylindrical periphery of shell 60, with a lead connection cable 65 to a suitable source of excitation, exemplified by the circuit of Fig. 3.Since the spacing between individual turns of coil 64 more than amply meets the spacing S vs. diameter D1 criteria of Fig.7, the exciation of coil 64 necessarily establishes uniform and well orientated flux within shell 60, for cell and or tissue coupling to the entire body of the patient accommodated at 61. With the apparatus of Fig. 9, it is thus possible to assure full electromagnetic body cell response as may be needed in conjunction with chemotherapy. In connection with Fig. 9, the frame members will be understood to suggest frame based elongate guide rails, extendable beyond one of the ends of shell 60, for convenient guided insertion of the patient, the mattress 61 and its platform 62, into the electromagnetic treatment zone within shell 60. Fig. 10 shows a simpler structure for providing full human body exposure to an electromagnetictreatment zone, but wherin manifestly, the totality of such exposure cannot be assured to the extent provided by the apparatus of Fig. 9. In Fig. 10 a complete mattress 70 of non paramagnetic material peripherally carried a single multiturn coil 71 which may be embodied in one of the welts of the mattress but which is shown intermediate the upper and lower welts, for protection of coil winding insulation and for mattress reversability. The flux uniformity and orientation considerations discussed in general in connection with Fig. 8 apply also to Fig. 10, so that the patient who rests on mattress 79 may be virtually assured of adequate magnetic flux exposure when coil 71 is excited, as long as he remains properly central of the mattress.Strap devices not shown exist for use with the mattress to confine the patient as desired on the mattress 70. Fig. 11 shows application of a two coil system to a supporting garment or vest having front and back fabric panels 75 76 which are connected over an upper shoulder region having a central opening 77, for head and neck accommodation. A tie such as an elastic band 78 connects panels 75 76 on one side, and a hooked tie 79 detachably connects panels 75 76 on the other side.A generally square first coil 80 maximizes use of available front panel area, and a similar coil 81 is similarly carried by the rear panel 76. Although not thus shown, it will be understood that coils 80 81 are connected in flux aiding relation, and simple detachable provision in the vicinity of and symbolized by fastening means 79 will serve for flexible and selective electrical connection of coils 80 81 to their source of excitation. A full and complete understanding of the mechanism by which cell and or tissue behavior is modified by the invention has yet to be given. It is presently believed, however, that each cell importantly includes an outer layer which is relatively electrically conductive, thus establishing for each cell what may be viewed as a short circuited single turn secondary, inherently susceptible to voltage induction and therefore voltage generation within each cell that is exposed to the time varying magnetic field established by the particular excited treatment coil or coils. It is believed that each cell may exhibit non linear electrical response and or non linea electrochemical response to cellinduced voltage in the presence of a low level timevarying magnetic field.Thus, non linearity in the response of the cell itself may perhaps be as much responsible as any other factor in achieving the described results. For a low level time varying electrical signal of arbitrary waveform to achieve a net biological effect, it is believed that the receiver the host cell and or tissue and or the cancer cells must possess non linear characteristics. For example, if a net perturbation i.e., net, over a period of time of the amount of a specifically adsorbed bound ion at a cell membrane site is the target or goal, then the use of induced current can cause this to occur only if the process exhibits a certain degree of irreversability i.e., non linearity in the case of body cell stimulation, it is believed that activation of calcium binding protein may be specificially involved in addition, it appears that adsorption and or transmembrane passage of cations e.g., Ca , Na , K are also believed to be significant to the response. This non linear property is also coupled with the basic kinetics relaxation time of the process. In other words, the parameters of the perturbing signal must be such that efficient coupling to the biological cell process can be achieved without such excessive amplitude as would remove the signal from the low level category and would invite the occurrence of other non electrical effects, such as thermal and ionizing effects, which it will be recalled from the present specific example are not measurably present for the low level amplitude example given. Quantitative assessment of the manner by which informational signals couple to cellular processes having the just described characteristics can be achieved by considering that i a surface process is involved, ii its basic kinetics are exponential in nature, iii net response during each cycle of a signal of arbitrary waveshape is given by a generalized expression for P, the net perturbation occurring for the duration of the waveform i.e., T1 T2 , iv the various repetitive natures of the signal burst and or repetition rate, as well as the basic waveform timing characteristics can be conveniently quantitated via spectral analysis using Laplace transformation, and v the overall net perturbation P can then be described in terms of its frequency content in the context of the electrical waveform characteristics. In the above manner, the desirable characteristics of a waveform of any shape can be chosen to provide a correlation between its frequency spectrum as determined by the electrochemical cell surface process and the elicited biological response. Generally, there will be an amplitude range or ranges over which the system receives an adequate dose to modulate function. The number of specific ranges depends upon system complexity.In other words, the more biological stages having distinct control processes, the more amplitude ranges may be present for selective operation upon the different control processes. While the invention has been described in detail for the specific illustrative apparatus and example, it will be understood that modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, in spite of the low level indicated for the present specific example of electromagnetic excitation on an intact animal organism bearing a neoplastic process, there is ample reason to believe that still lower or higher levels e.g., lower to the extent of an order of magnitude or more may be equally if not more effective in extending life expectancy or otherwise improving upon one or more of the current approaches to drug treatment of solid tumors and or leukemia. It is also to be understood that in view of the incomplete and perhaps incorrect nature of one or more of the foregoing explanations for tumorous body response to drug treatment concurrent with electromagnetical treatment, the invention is not to be deemed limited by such explanations. And it is further to be understood that the invention may also have application to such recognized techniques of drug treatment of neoplastic processes other than chemotherapy as immunotherapy, hormone therapy and interferon therapy. Also, in the present context of incompletely understanding the precise effect of electromagnetic therapy in conjunction with drug treatment of cancer, the possibility also exists that the described electromagnetic coupling may significantly alter drug metabolism, pharmacology or distribution in the body.
