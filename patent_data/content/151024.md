# Selector mechanism for an infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
A mechanism for the selection of various operational ranges of an infinitely variable belt drive transmission for a vehicle, the mechanism having a shift lever provided to be shifted along a straight line. The transmission has a drive range and a high engine speed drive range which is provided to downshift the transmission during the drive of the vehicle in the drive range. The mechanism is provided with a cam plate responsive to the operation of the selector lever and having a cam groove for providing the drive range and the high engine speed drive range under the drive range state. Knowing which column is being scanned and detecting the photo transistor by its signal, enables detecting which key is depressed. In an alternative embodiment, the LED s and photo tran sistors are located remotely from the keyboard and light is transmitted in both cases through optical fibers.
