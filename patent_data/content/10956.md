# Clutch facing and method for its manufacture.

## Abstract
A wound clutch facing is made from a glass yarn of a rough physical form and a binder. The glass yarn contains at least one continuous filament strand and may for example be a doubled yarn or a yarn having a structure in which a sliver of staple glass is wound on a continuous filament core, or a yarn with a core 8 structure out of which loops 9 project at intervals. The latter yarn can be made by a wrapping technique. The binder can include both thermoset resin and rubber. The method for the manufacture of the clutch facings consists in first impregnating the yarn, then winding the impregnated yarn into the form of a facing and press curing the facing.

## Description
Improvements in or relating to Friction MaterialsThis invention relates to friction materials, and in particular to clutch facings of wound construction.Conventional, asbestos containing, friction facings may be manufactured by impregnating an asbestos yarn with a drying oil or a solution of a thermo setting resin or vulcanisable elastomer, drying to remove excess solvent and then winding to produce an annular shaped facing. The facings may be heated after winding, to harden the oil, resin or elastomer binding agent or they may be cured in a die by the application of heat and pressure. Die cured facings are often baked at elevated temperatures after curing to improve strength or friction properties.Friction facings are commonly wound using one of the following two winding patterns 1. Spiral Wound One or more ends of impregnated yarn are wound onto a circular former clamped between two large circular flanges with the simultaneous application of pressure on the wound yarn by means of a thin, circular roller free to rotate in the space between the two side flanges. 2. Random Wound One or more ends of impregnated ya rn are wound so as to form an annular shaped facing, the yarns lying in sinusoidal or elliptical shaped patterns around the annulus and so arranged that the patterns formed by successive layers of yarns are offset from each other. Pressure is applied to the yarn during winding, sufficient to cause successive layers of yarn to adhere to each other.Spiral wound facings possess a better burst strength the speed at which the facing, when rotated about its centre, disintegrates under the action of centrifugal forces than random wound facings but are more prone to splitting, in a circumferential direction, between adjacent yarns.The present invention provides a clutch facing of wound construction comprising at least one glass yarn and a binder in which said glass yarn is a yarn of a rough physical form as hereinafter defined and said binder comprises a thermosetting polymeric material and serves to bond the wound yarn into the form of an annular clutch facing.Glass filaments have a smooth outer surface so that bundles of such filaments, whether twisted or untwisted, have a surface which constitutes a series of parallel smooth filaments. We have found that in a wound clutch facing a glass yarn with such a surface is extremely difficult to consolidate into a satisfactory facing, there being a tendency for such facings to split by separation of the yarns, the binder being unable to hold them together satisfactorily in service.By the term rough physical form we mean having a shape or surface form, or both, which provides interstices in the yarn such as to enable the binder to key into the yarn. The form of such yarns also bridges resin rich areas in the facing, improving interlaminar strength.The minimum requirement for this form we believe to be fulfilled by a doubled yarn construction in which two or more twisted continous filament glass fibre strands or rovings are doubled together.Preferably, however, the yarn has a rough surface produced by at least a portion of the surface being staple glass fibre sliver, in which the individual fibres are non parallel, although the yarn should contain continuous filaments of glass as well as the staple fibre, or the yarn itself has a rough shape e.g. a yarn formed by doubling or by a wrapping technique in which one component is overfed to give rise to side loops extending laterally from the yarn.Two examples of yarns which are of the preferred types are a Yarns consisting of staple glass sliver wrapped around a core of continous filament glass strands and consolidated either by a fine synthetic fibre yarn around the resulting bundle, or by twisting. b Yarns comprising a core structure comprising one or more strands and, arising out of said structure at intervals, loops of predetermined size, said core structure and or said loops comprising at least one strand of continuous filament glass. Such yarns may be made by fancy doubling techniques.In essence in fancy doubling , one or more yarns, strands or slivers the effect yarns are fed forward into the twisting zone of a yarn twisting frame faster than one or more other yarns, strands or slivers the core yarns , thereby forming loops as the components are twisted together. Traditionally, this is performed using two sets of nip rollers running at different speeds and the product is wound up directly onto a conventional spinning package. More recently a variant on this process has been developed whereby the yarn, while in its twisted state, is helically wrapped with a fine binder thread and the twist then released, i.e. it is merely false twisted. This method has general advantages over the traditional one in terms of speed and versatility but affords a particular benefit in the production of glass yarns.Because of the stiffness of glass, yarns made from it tend to exhibit twist liveliness at much lower twist levels than natural and syntheic organic fibres and fancy yarns made by the traditional method require stabilising by doubling with at least one similar yarn before they can readily be handled.Yarns made by the wrapping method, by contrast, have no net twist and are thus stable without further processing.This method is, therefore, preferred.The process cannot be simplified by omitting the false twisting step and merely wrapping a number of threads fed forward at different speeds because under such conditions the loop size and frequency become irregular. Uniformity of loop size and distribution is greatly improved by the presence of at least two core yarns.As will readily be appreciated, the size and frequency of loops depends on the degree of overfeed of the effect yarns usually expressed as a on the core speed and the twist i nserted. To a first approximation the greater the overfeed the larger the loops and the higher the twist the more frequent and smaller the loops. Superimposed on this basic pattern there is a tendency for the excess effect yarn to be held back from the twisting point by centrifugal forces, being caught intermittently to form larger and less frequent loops than would be expected. Regularity can be improved by the use of a number of fine effect yarns rather than a single coarse one and by the use of the softest effect yarns available.In the case of glass yarns this means that the most regular products are obtained by using as effect yarns a number of low tex strands of minimum filament diameter having a soft, lubricious dressing. In fact, compromise is necessary as such materials tend to be a expensive and b of less than ideal compatibility with the kind of resin systems likely to be used as binders in the clutch facings to be made from the yarn, e.g.phenol formaldehyde resins.The twisting frames used for the production of fancy doubled yarns are well known and available from a number of manufacturers.The machine for carrying out the preferred wrapping method is illustrated in the accompanying drawings of which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of the wrapping machine and Figure 2 is a schematic illustration of a looped structure yarn produced thereby. Referring to Figure 1 the core yarns are drawn under tension through grooves cut in the nip rollers R1 by the nip rollers R2 and the effect components are overfed by the nip R1 . Alternatively, the cores can pass under, or to the side of the nip R1 . Twist is inserted in the yarn between the twist trap 6, rotating with the spindle 3, and the nip R1 and the yarn is wrapped inside the spindle by yarn 4 drawn from the pirn 5, also mounted on and rotating with the spindle. The twist is removed between the twist trap 6 and the nip R2 and the yarn then passes round a guide pulley 7 and is wound up not shown . The overfeed can be adjusted by alteration of the speed of nip R1 relative to the overall machine speed governed by the nip R2 . Such a machine is commercially obtainable from Gemmill andDunsmore Ltd. of Preston. An idealised yarn structure with one core 8, one effect yarn 9 and a binder thread 10 is shown in Fig. 2.The overfeed of the effect yarns is preferably limited to the range 10 to 106 and the wrapper ie binder thread, to 5 of the total yarn weight.The glass fibre yarn or strand is impregnated by passing it through a bath containing a solution or dispersion of the binder and removing excess impregnant to produce the desired impregnant pickup. Excess impregnant may be removed by means of nip rollers, felt wipers or compressed air doctor or any other suitable device. Solvent or other fluid phase is removed by passing the yarn through an oven or up a drying tower in which hot air is circulated. A desired state of precure of the binder may be achieved by controlling the air temperature and the time of residence of the yarn in the drying tower or oven. The dried yarn is then wound onto bobbins of convenient size.Annular shaped friction facings are manufactured by winding the impregnated and dried yarn in either a spiral or random pattern by any convenient means. The facings may be heated in an oven, if desired, to advance the state of cure of the binder material or to remove any remaining volatile matter. The facings are then cured in an enclosed die or mould, with the application of heat and pressure, to consolidate the facings and harden the binder material.After press curing, the facings may be baked, at temperatures usually in the range of 1500 to 2500C, to further advance the state of cure of the resin and or to improve the friction properties of the completed facing. During baking, the facings are normally clamped between two rigid metal flanges to prevent any distortion thus maintaining flatness in the finished facing. The facings may be coated with a release agent, if required, to prevent adhesion whilst clamped together during baking. Finely ground talc has been found satisfactory for this purpose. The facings are then ground on each face, e.g. using a double disc grinder, to produce the desired thickness. The inner and outer edges may be machined to the required dimensions or the facing used without machining if accurately moulded to the correct dimensions.Impregnant SystemThe preferred method of impregnating the glass yarns used in this invention comprises two stages as follows a The yarn is impregnated with a dilute solution of thermosetting resin which binds together the individual glass filaments and improves adhesion of the secondary binder to the glass filaments. Whilst solutions of phenol formaldehyde resins may be used, materials with improved surface finish and appearance are obtained using solutions of cashew modified phenol formaldehyde resins. Cashew modified phenolic resins are much less brittle than unmodified phenolic resins grinding of materials containing cashew modified resins does not appear to cause crazing of the resin and loosening of the glass fibres at the surface of the material. b After impregnating with a resin solution and drying, the yarn is re impregnated with a more viscous solution or dispersion of a natural or synthetic elastomer which may also contain a thermosetting resin. The yarn must, after drying to remove solvent, possess sufficient tack to enable it to adhere to itself when subjected to pressure during the winding operation but not stick when wound onto a storage reel. Curing agents are added to the impregnant to cause hardening of the elastomer during press curing of the wound facings. Rubber reinforcing agents, e.g. carbon black and phenolic resins may be added to improve strength. Tackifiers, such as are commonly used in the rubber industry, may be added to improve the tackiness of the impregnated yarn. Friction modifiers, wear improving materials and fillers may be also added to the impregnant if desired.This method of impregnation is the subject of our co pending UK patent application No. 42349 78 filed on even date herewith. The invention is now illustrated by means of detailed Examples.ExamplesThe following impregnation system has been used in all the examples to be described. The primer coating resin solution was diluted with methylated spirits to control the final dry resin content of the impregnated glass yarn. The impregnated yarn was dried after primer coating with resin and secondary coating with the rubber based dope.Primer CoatingCashew modified phenol formaldehyde resin of 54 56 solids content, viscosity 110 140 centipoise at 250C and a test tube cure time of five minutes at 1500C, was diluted with industrial methylated spirits to suit the particular yarn to be impregnated.Secondary CoatingStyrene Butadiene Rubber S1006 21.4 parts by weightMineral Rubber 4.1 N Carbon Black H.A.F. 18.1Graphite Powder 6.1 Barytes 14.1 parts of weightSulphur 10.5Litharge 22.7Coumarone Indene Resin 3.0Phenol Formaldehyde Resin Powder 5.35The materials in the above formulation were mixed until well blended using a Baker Perkins Shearmix, disintegrated in a rotating knife cutter and dispersed in naphtha, using a high speed mixer, to produce a dispersion of 40 solids. The primer coated yarn was then impregnated with this dispersion and dried to remove the naphtha solvent.Random wound clutch facings were then made for test purposes from various glass yarns impregnated as above.
