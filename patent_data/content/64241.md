# Process for producing ethylene glycol and or glycolic acid ester, catalyst composition used therefor, and process for the production of this composition.

## Abstract
A hydrogenation catalyst composition useful for the hydrogenation of an oxalate diester, said composition being composed of a reduction product of copper containing silica gel formed by contacting an ammine complex of copper with colloidal silica sol and a process for producing the aforesaid composition. Using a catalyst composed of the aforesaid composition, ethylene glycol and or a glycolic acid ester can be produced from an oxalate diester efficiently with high conversions and selectivities.
