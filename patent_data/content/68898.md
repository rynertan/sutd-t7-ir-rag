# Method for producing low sulfur premium coke from high sulfur decant oils.

## Abstract
A method of producing a premium coke having a sulfur content of less than about 0,8 by weight from a decant oil having a sulfur content of from about 1.0 to about 4 by weight and resulting from the catalytic cracking of petro leum, comprising the steps of a hydrodesulfurizing the decant oil with a porous catalyst having at least 80 of its pores with diameters greater than about 70 Angstroms and b delayed coking the hydrodesulfurized decant oil.
