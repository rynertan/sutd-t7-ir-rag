# Electrochemical sensor and membrane therefor.

## Abstract
Polymerizable silicon containing compounds are polymerized or further polymerized in dispersed form to form cured layers or membranes when cured or polymerized in a dispersed layer upon removal of the continuous phase during curing to provide a layer or membrane having unexpectedly good oxygen and glucoze permeability without allowing the passage of electrode sensitive interferants therethrough. The membranes also are permeable to cholesterol, uric acid, and lower alcohols, such as ethanol. The polymerizable silicon containing compounds, after dispersion in a continuous phase, such as by including an emulzifier, can be cured in any known manner during removal of the continuous phase, such as by evaporation of water from a water continuous phase silicon emulsion or dispersion. A glucose catalyst layer, such as glycose oxidase, can be bonded directly to an electrical signal receiving surface, such as an electrode, and the mem brane applied over the catalyst to form an electrochemical sensor having new and unexpected accuracy. Whole blood is applied directly onto the membrane, allowing passage of glucose and oxygen to the glucose oxidase layer while pre venting passage of substantially all other electrode interfer ants present in whole blood. The glucose and oxygen interact with the glucose oxidase catalyst to produce hydrogen perox ide which is received immediately by the electrode surface. Since the membrane is whole blood compatible, at the con clusion of the measurement, the whole blood on the surface of the membrane may be rinsed or wiped off and the sensor is ready for measurement of another specimen.
