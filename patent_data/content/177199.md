# MOULDING APPARATUS FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY FORMING A CAVITY AND ENCAPSULATING A FRAME IN A FOAMED BODY

## Abstract
A dual lid moulding apparatus for a two stage moulding process which provides for frame encapsulation in a foamed article also having a moulded in cavity. The moulding apparatus is constructed by pivotally connecting two mould closure members 40,50 at either side of a female base mould 30 . The two mould closure members 40,50 are sequentially engaged with the female base mould 30 during the two stage moulding process. A frame member 18 and a multitude of cavities may be embedded in the foamed article by using this technique.
