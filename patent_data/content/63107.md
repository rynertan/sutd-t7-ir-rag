## Description
The present invention relates to a metal structure,for storing articles and making shelvings and the like. As it is well known,the side walls of shelvings and the like,for storing bulky and heavy articles, generally consist of a upright pair,coupled to one another by welding,diagonal braces and cross members. This approach,though it is a satisfactory one, for a structural standpoint,presents however the drawback of generating tediousproblems,in the side wall transportation and storing steps,since the latter have to be shipped to the use place in a completely assembled condition. Moreover,in order to meet the most different requirements of the market, it is necessary to provide for the making of a large dimension range, both depending on the height and the width of the shelving to be built. Yet another drawback of theknown shelvings is that the making of a side wall requires a lot of welding labour,thereby the formed product is a highly expensive one. Accordingly the task of the present invention is to provide a shelving structure,provided with side walls which can be easily obtained by removably coupling the component elements thereof to one another, and which are effective to eliminateiall of the thereinabove mentioned drawbacks. Within the scope of this task,a main object of the present invention is to provide shelving side walls effective to be assembled to any desired size,by using simple sections effective to be cut to size at the assembling step. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a structure which,in addition to having a simple mounting,is also effective to provide great reliability and safety use characteristics. Yet another object if the present invention, is to provide such a structure which,owing to its modularity characteristics, is effective to solve all of the storing problems,both during the production and the transportation steps. According to one aspect of the present invention the thereinabove mentioned task and objects, as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent hereinafter,are achieved by a metal structure for storing articles and making shelvings,characterized in that it comprises side walls,consisting of a side upright pair,having a substantially C shaped cross section,provided with turned edges at the free ends of the legs thereof,on said turned edges there being formed perforation sets,spaced at determined pitch from one another,therein may be removably engaged the lug portions of a plate pair for fixing cross members and diagonal braces, said plates being provided with oppositely located through holes,therewith bolts engage for fixing said cross members and diagonafbraces. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become more apparent hereinafter from the following detailed description of a preferred,though not exclusive,embodiment of a metal structure,being illustrated by way of an indicative example in the accompanying drawings, where fig.l is a perspective exploded view illustrating the component elements of a side wall fig.2 is a perspective view illustrating a upright thereto the plates are coupled,before the fixing of a cross member fig.3 illustrates,by a partially broken away view,the coupling of the plates to a. upright and fig.4 is a schematic view illustrating the procedure for malting a side wall. With reference to the number references of the figures of the accompanying drawings, the metal structure for storing articles and making shelvings,according to the present invention, comprises two side walls or panels,indicated generally at l,which consist of a vertically extending upright pair 2,which latter are made of a suitable gauge section.Each upright 2 has a substantiallyC shaped cross section with turned edges 3,at the free ends of the legs 4.More specifically.the turned edges 3 are arranged substantially parallel with respect to the central portion 5 and face to one another. Moreover the upright pair,as a side wall is built,are so arranged that the turned edges 3 thereof are located adjoining one another. A main feature of the invention is that on the edges 3 perforation sets 6 are formed,which are arranged at a determined pitch from one another, and cyclically repeat all along the lenght of the uprights 2.With the holes 6 slanted lug portions 7 of a clamping plate pair 8 may be engaged, said plates 8 being preferably provided with a flat fin or web 9 and a slanted fin 10 which latter defines, on the free end thereof,the aforesaid lug portions 7. On the flat wing 9 of said plates 8 there are formed through holes ll,thereinto bolts 12 can be inserted,provided with nuts 13 for fixing the cross members 14 and diagonal braces 15 coupling the two uprights,thereby allowing for a side wall to be erected.At the central portion 5,there are provided windows 16,of known type,and arranged offset to one another for coupling side walls to one another and the related shelves. The making of the shelvings,by the thereinabove disclosed method,is a very simple operation.Infact the user,for example,may buy the uprights 2 by meters and cut the latter,to the desired size, as they are assembled. In order to assemble the cross members and diagonal braces 15 it is sufficient to apply,at the desired zones,the plates 8 and clamp the latter by means of the bolts 12. Moreover the width of the made side walls may be easily adjusted,depending on the contingent needs,by simply changing the lenght and type of cross members and diagonal braces,or possibly by varying the slanting of the diagonal braces.ln particular the fact is to be pointed out that the possibility of carrying out the mounting of the side wall by a simple bolting operation,inste ad of using a welding procedure,allows for the storing costs to be drastically reduced,as well as those related to the side walls shipping. In addition to the above,the user can directly assemble the side walls,depending on his needs.Finally the use of the plates 8,for fixing the cross members and diagonal braces,affords the possibility of employing uprights of comparatively simple size thus they are of low cost and may be easily assembled. Another important aspect of the present invention is the great flexibility of the system which also affords the possibility of easily disassemblying a side wall,as it is required,and easily recovering for re use the components thereof. The invention as disclosed is susceptible to several modifications and variations,all falling within the scope of the invention.Moreover all of the details can be replaced by other technically equivalent elements. In practicing the invention,the used materials,though they are compatible to the t intended application,as well d the contingent shape and size may be any,depending on the needs.
