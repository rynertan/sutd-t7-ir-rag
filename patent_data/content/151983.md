# Vane pump.

## Abstract
In a vane pump, a pump housing contains a cam ring having an internal cam surface, in which a rotor carrying eight vanes is rotatable by a drive shaft. A pair of side plates positioned in the receiving bore in contact engagement with the opposite end surface of the cam ring, the internal cam surface and the rotor define a pump chamber. Each of the side plates is formed at its inside surface contacting the cam ring with a pair of intake ports, a pair of exhaust ports and a vane back pressure groove. This groove is always filled with pressuired fluid supplied from the exhaust ports such that the pressurized fluid is directed into vane support slits formed in the rotor. The angular width between the start point of each of the intake ports and the start point of one of the exhaust ports is chosen to an angle of 90 degrees which is twice the pitch of the vanes, and the angular width of each of the exhaust ports is chosen to be not larger than an angular width which outer end surfaces of two successive vanes make, whereby the volume of pressurized fluid which leaks from the vane back pressure groove towards the intake ports through a clearance between the rotor and each side plate can be maintained constant.
