# PROCEDURE FOR PRODUCING A NONSHRINKABLE GLUING OR COATING FILM

## Abstract
The present invention concerns a procedure for produc ing a nonshrinkable gluing or coating film. The gluing or coating film 16 is placed on the surface to be glued or coated, or between different surfaces, and fixed thereto by fusing it with the aid of heat. The gluing or coating film 16 is produced by extruding, with the aid of a planar nozzle 11 , hot bonding plastic. The hot bonding plastic contains 0.1 to 10 by weight of chemical and or physical cell generating agents, which gasify at the extrusion step and perforate the fluing or coating film 16 coming from the planar nozzle 11 . For hot bonding plastic is used a thermoplastic material, such as polyethylene, a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate, or polypropylene.
