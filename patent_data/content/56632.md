# CIRCUIT INTERRUPTER

## Abstract
A circuit interrupter includes a cylindrical container 5 having an arcuate inner wall of electrically insulating mate rial and containing an arc extinguishing fluid. A rotary shaft 7 is provided along an axis of the container 5 , at least one stationary contact 3 or 4 is provided at a predetermined position on the inner wall, and a movable contact 6 is mounted on the rotary shaft 7 in such manner as to be brought into and out of engagement with the or each stationary contact. A closing member 15 is disposed at one end of the opening movement path of the movable contact 6 and substantially closes the clearance between the inner wall and the rotary shaft 7 and, when the interrupter is opened, sweeps along the inner wall of the container 5 towards the closing member 15 to compress the arc extinguishing fluid between the two members 15, 16 . The compressing member 16 has a blow outlet 18 which causes the compressed fluid to blow into the space where arcs are generated upon opening of the interrupter.
