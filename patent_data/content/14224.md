CT designates current transformers and ES designates grounding switches Fig. 2 shows a side elevational view of the gas insulated switch gear apparatus of the present invention which is constructed to correspond to Fig. 1. First and second base planes 100 and 200 arranged in parallel to each other at different vertical spatial levels are constructed in two story construction b a frame 300. The first base plane 100 vertically overlaps with the second base plane 200. A first electric equipment 110 is mounted on the first base plane, and first gas insulated busbar device 120 is arranged at a position horizontally spaced from the first electric equipment 110, which includes a gas filled circuit breaker 111 and first and second gas insulated disconnecting switches 113 and 114. The gas filled circuit breaker 111 includes at least one circuit breaking element having a pair of contacts arranged opposite to be contacted to each other and separated from each other.The circuit breaking element is horizontally arranged along an axis of make and break of the pair of contacts within a container not shown in which insulative quenching gas is filled. The first gas insulated disconnecting 113 is connected to one end of the circuit breaking element while the second gas insulated disconnecting switch 114 is connected to the other end of the circuit breaking element. The first and second gas insulated disconnecting switches 113 and 114 are separately and horizontally arranged in containers in each of which insulative quenching gas is filled. The first gas insulated busbar device 120 is electrically connected to the first gas insulated disconnecting switch 113 of the first electric equipment 110 on the first base plane 100 through a T shaped connecting container 117. The first gas insulated busbar device 120 includes conductors accommodated in 2 sheath in which gas is filled. In Fig. 2, the first gas insulated busbar device 120 is of three phase isolated construction. The second gas insulated disconnecting switch 114 is connected to a bushing 115 which is held to the frame 300 at a predetermined angle to the first base plane. The gas filled circuit breaker 111 is supported by a rack 116. A second electric equipment 210 is arranged on the second base plate 200 and supported by a rack 216 at a position corresponding to that on the first base plane 100. The second electric equipment 210 includes a gas filled circuit breaker 211, a first gas insulated disconnecting switch 213 and a second gas insulated disconnecting switch 214. A second gas insulated busbar device 220 is arranged at a position horizontally space from the second electric equipment 210. The second gas insulted busbar device 220 is connected to the second electric equipment 220 through a connecting container 217. The first and second gas insulated busbar devices 120 and 220 are electrically interconnected through a gas insulated connecting busbar device 400 which comprises conductors accowdated whIn a sheath in which insulative quenching gas is filled. Fig. 3 shows a plane view of Fig. 2 for illustrating a plan vie of the second base plane. A relation between the gas insulated busbar devices and the electric equipments is explained with reference toFig. 3. The gas insulated busbar device 220 is electri celly connected to the electric equipment 212 on the second base plane 200. The gas filled circuit breaker 211 and the gas insulated disconnecting switches 213 and 214 of the electric equipment 210 are coaxially arranged on the base plane. The gas insulated busbar device 220 is arranged so that the axial line thereof traverses the axial line of the electric equipment 210. A relation between the first base plane 100 an the second base plane 200 is such that vertical projections of the axial lines of the electric equipment and the gas insulated busbar device on one base plane onto the other base plane coincide with the axial lines of the electric equipment and the gas insulated busbar device on the other base plane. As shown by dotted line in Fig. 3, the gas filled circuit breaker 218 may be arranged on an axial line other than the axial line connecting the gas insulated busbar 220 to the bushing 215. In this case, the vertical projections of the axial lines of the electric equipment and the gas insulated busbar device on one base plane onto the other base plane partially overlap the axial lines of the electric equipment and the gas insulated busbar device on the other base plane. As described above, in accordance with the present embodiment, the first and second base planes provided, on which feeder switching apparatus comprising the gas filled circuit breakers and the first and second gas insulated disconnecting switches is arranged. The gas insulated busbar devices are arranged at the positions horizontally spaced from the feeder switching apparatus.On the first and second base planes, the first gas insulated disconnecting switch is connected to the gas insR 5d b1sbnr device wk le he second gas insulated disconnecting switch is connected to the bushing. The axial line of the feeder switching apparatus along which the first and second gas insulated disconnecting switches are arranged transverses the axial line of the gas insulated busbar device. The axial lines of the gas insulated busbar devices arranged on the first and second base planes, respectively, are positioned in a common vertical plane including those axial lines and in the respective base planes. The gas insulated connecting busbar device is arranged such that the axial line thereof lies in the common vertical plane and traverses the axial line of the gas insulated busbar device. While the upper and lower busbar devices 120 and 220 are shown to be connected through the connecting busbar device 40Q at the end of the busbar device 220, the connecting busbar device 400 may be connect to any other point. The gas insulated equipments described above are housed in containers in which insulative medium such as SF6 gas is filled as is the case of the gas filled circuit breaker, with the equipments being insulated from. the containers to form charging portion. As described above, according to the present embodiment, the floor space for mounting the equipments can be considerably reduced since the electric equipments 110 and 210 are mounted on the first and second base parer 100 and 200. Furthermore, since the busbar devices 120 and 220 are horizontally spaced from. the electric ee ments 110 and 210, they can be easily installed, rain tained and inspected without being affected by other apparatus or equipments. As shown in Fig. 3, in the feeder switching apparatus arranged on the first and second base pianos 100 and 200, the gas insulated disconnecting Switon connected to one end of the gas filled circuit breaker 211 is connected to the gas insult busbar dev i c 220 with their axial lines intersecting to each other w.le the other disconnecting switch 214 is connected with L bushing 215. The feeder switching apparatus are heri zontally arranged on the second base plate 200 and also arranged in parallel to construct a phase isolated configuration horizontally to the axial line of the gas insulated busbar device 220. The feeder switching apparatus on the first base plane 100 are also arranged in the same manner as the feeder switching apparatus on the second base plane 200, and each of the feeder switching apparatus is positioned in the same vertical plane on base plane 100 or 200. That is, the gas filed circuit breakers and the gas insulated disconnecting switches are arranged on the first and second base planes on the axial lines connecting the gas insulated busbar devices 120 and 220, respectively, to the bushings 115 and 215, respectively. By arranging the electric equipments in the manner described above, the arrangements of the gas insulated busbar devices and the electric equipments can be definltely sectioned in the horizontal plane and the electric equipments such as the gas filled circuit breakers can be horizontally arranged at the same position on the first and second base planes. Consequently, the floor space for mounting the electric equipments can be considerably reduced and the total height of the equiprents can be reduced. Furthermore, the installation, maintenance and inspection of 2 single gas insulated busbar device or a single electric equipment c2n be easily made without affecting the other devices and equipments and without being affected by other devices and equipments. Accordingly, the installation of additional feeder switch ing apparatus on the base planes is also facilitated. The above concept of the present invention can also be applied to combined three phase busbar devices or comolned three phase gas filled circuit breakers. The feeder switching apparatus include line switching apparatus to be connected to transmission lines and bank switching apparatus to be connected to transformers. When all of the line switching apparatus as the feeaer switching apparatus are arranged in paia lIel on or base plane, e.g. the base plane 200 in Fig. 2 and all of the bank switching apparatus as the feeder switching apparatus are arranged in parallel on the base plane 100, the feed in and the feed out to and from the bushings 115 and 215 are facilitated very much. This arrangement is advantageous particularly when cables are used instead of the bushing 115 because the level of the base plane 200 can be reduced. When the bushings 115 and 215 are used in the above arrangement insulation distance in gas may pose 2 problem but it can be resolved by arranging the bushIngs 115 and 215 at a predetermined angle to the base planes as sown in Fig. 2.In this case, leads from the bushings may be supported by insulators 119 and 219 having their ends fixed to the frame 300 or a wall. Alternatively, as shown by broken line in Fig. 3, the bushings 215 of the feeder switching apparatus mounted on the upper beoc plate 200 and the bushings 115 of the feeder switching apparatus mounted on the lower base plate 100 may be axially displaced from the busbar device 200 so that the bushings 115 are positioned between the bushings 215.With this arrangement, insulation distance in gas between the adjacent bushings can be increased and the level of the upper base plane 200 can be lowered. If the feeder switching apparatus on the lower base plane 100 is also displaced to conform to the arrange ment of the bushings 115, the axial length of the lower busbar device 12G must be increased because of the connecting busbar device 400 and hence the arrangements on the respective base planes must be changed. In this case, therefore, it is desirable to bend the container between the disconnecting switch and the bushing 115. Alternatively, distance between the disconnecting switches 11a and 21 arranged on the side of the bushings and the bushings 115 and 215 may be changed to mount the bushings verticll, or the other disconnecting switches may be arranged in the container 217 so that the bushings 115 are displaced leftward and mounted vertically. In this case, the cisconnecting switches may be arranged in a bushing pocket lower container of the bushing . Those modificatIons of the bushing arrangement can further simplify the arrangernent of the gas insulated switching apparatus of the present invent ion in which the busbar devices 120 and 220 are arranged on one of the base planes 100 and 200 and the electric equipments and the busbar devices are separated on the horizontal planes and at different vertical spatial levels As is apparent from the above description, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invent ion, a plurality of electric equipments including the gas filled circuit breakers and the gas insulated disconnecting switches are horizontally arranged on two base planes arranged in parallel to each other at different vertical spatIal levels, and the gas insulated busbar devices are arranged in parallel to each other on one side of the base plates with the gas insulated busbar devices being interconnected by the a insulated connecting busbar device. In this manner, the arrangement of the electric equipments and the arrangement of the bush a devices are separated from each other on horizontal plane and at different vertical spatial levels so that t floor space for mounting can be considerably reduced an the installation, maintenance and inspection of the equipments are very much facilitated. Fig. 4 shows a circuit wiring diagram of adual busbar system, which includes, in addiction tc the configu ration of Fig. 1, a second busbar device 500 600 l r is parallel to the busbar device 120 22C , and cisconnect ing switches 511 and 611 which are connected in with disconnecting switches 113 and 213, respectivel between the busbar device 500 600 and the disconnecting switches 111 and 211, respectively. Fig. 5 shows a side elevational view of anc embodiment of the gas insulated switch gear apparatus of the present invention which is constructed to correspond to the circuit wiring diagram of the dual busbar syster shown in Fig. 4. In the arrangement shown in Fie. 5, second gas insulated busbar devices 500 and 600 are arranged adjacent to the gas insulated busbar devices 120 and 220, respectively, which are arranged on the base planes 100 and 200. The axial lines of the second gas insulated busbar devices 500 and 600 are parallel te the axial lines of the gas insulated busbar devices 120 and 22G.The second gas insulated busbar devices 500 and 600 are electrically interconnected by a second gas insulated connecting busbar device 700. With this arrangement, the dual busbar system gas insulated switch gear apparatus can be readily attained. In the present embodiment, like in the embodi men of Fig. 2, the feeder switching apparatus horizontally arrangec on the base planes 100 and 200 are connected to the busbar devices 120, 220, 500 and 60o through the connecting containers 117, 217, 510, 610 so that they traverse the axial lines of the busbar devices as shown in Fig. 6. A plurality of feeder switching apparatus are arranged in parallel in phase separated construction alor.c the axial line of the busbar devices on the base planes 100 and 200, as described above.Additional disconnecting switches 511 and 611 are housed in connecting containers 510 and 610. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, since the gas insulated busbar devices are horizontally spaced from the electric equipments and they are vertically spaced from each other, the floor space for mounting is considerably reduced and the installation, maintenance and inspection oi the equipments are facilitated. In one example of a 500 i X class gas insulated switch gear apparatus, the height of the equipments is as hih as 3 h meters. As described above, according to the present invention, the busbar devices are arranged on one side of the base planes of the multi story construction, the busbars on the respective base planes are electrically interconnected through the connecting busbar devices, and the electric equipments which include the gas filled circuit breakers and the disconnecting switches are arranged on the horizontal planes which are normal to the busbar devices. Consequently, the floor space for mounting can be considerably reduced and the installation, maintenance and inspection of the equipments are very much facIlitated. Furthermore, the standarization of the equipments for the single busbar system and the dual busbar system can be attained.
