# Selectable markers for yeast transformation.

## Abstract
Plasmid vectors capable of transforming Sacchar omyces cerevisiae to phenotypes characterized by resistance to selective concentrations of sulfonylurea herbicides are disclosed, as well as plasmid vector host strain systems for expression of DNA normally exogenous to S. cerevisia, a method of introducing DNA normally exogenous to S. cerevisiae to a S. cerevisiae host cell, and a DNA segment comprising a mutant allele of S. cerevisiae ILV2, which allele encodes a gene product resistant to selective concentrations of sulfometuron methyl.
