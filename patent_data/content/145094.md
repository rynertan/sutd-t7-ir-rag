# Process for preparing a transition metal silicate catalyst.

## Abstract
The invention provides a process for the preparation of a transition metal silicate catalyst in which an insoluble, basic compound of a transition metal having an atomic number between 26 and 30 in particular nickel which has an atomic number of 28 is rapidly precipitated with an alkaline precipitation agent from an aqueous solution of such a metal salt, as a suspension, which precipitate is allowed to mature for a longer period in a suspended form, and, after the transition metal ions have been practically completely precipitated, soluble silicate is added to the suspension, after which the solids are separated from the liquid, optionally washed, dried and reduced.
