# Method and apparatus for terminating a reciprocable electrical connector.

## Abstract
The apparatus 1 automatically terminates the end of a flat flexible cable 2 in a reciprocably actuable low insertion force connector 3 having a dielectric housing 6 with a cable receiving cavity 12 and a terminal member 14 disposed in the cavity. The connector also includes a reciprocating cover 8 having a cable receiving aper ture 28 and mounted for reciprocal movement between an open position for receiving the cable 2 , and a closed position for terminating the cable within the connector. The apparatus includes an insertion head 50 and an arrangement 4 for automatically positioning the insertion head with respect to the cable receiving aperture 28 of the connector 3 . The insertion head further includes a recipro cable cable feeder 60 which inserts the cable end through the aperture 28 , and a recicprocable actuator 70 which moves the cover 8 after insertion of the cable end in the connector.
