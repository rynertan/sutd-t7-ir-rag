# Blood vessel projection imaging system using nuclear magnetic resonance.

## Abstract
A two dimensional projection image of the NMR activity within a volume is obtained. The signals due to static material are cancelled and do not appear in the projection image. The signals due to moving blood in vessels produce an isolated image of the vessels with the superimposed structure removed.
