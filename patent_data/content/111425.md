# HINGE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A hinge assembly 3 for a sunroof panel 4 is located with its effective transverse pivot axis W only slightly rearward of the vertical plane containing the front edge 4a of the panel 4, so as to minimise compressive wear on the elastomer panel seal 10 when the panel 4 is opened. For example, a metal channel 15 secured to the flap has a rounded forward edge 35 fitting in a groove 12, and held thereby by elasticity of seal 10, optionally plus channel elasticity. A protective cowl 13 can protect this arrangement, and is capable of being pulled back around pivot Y by a finger pull in space 5 against over centre mounting X Y Z. Such control movement also affects the securing of channel 15 to the pane 4, whereby channel 15 falls downwards to free the pivot 35 12 and thus allow the hinge assembly to be removed.
