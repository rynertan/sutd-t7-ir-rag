The resultingcompound I can be isolated and purified in a manner known When the starting compound III or its salt and or the acylating agent used in the acylation contains anasymmetric carbon in the molecule, the stereoisomers may be used either singly or in admixture. If theacylation causes the formation of two or more of stereoisomeric products, the individual stereoisomers canbe isolated in a conventional manner such as column chromatography, recrystallization or the like, ifnecessary. The group R in the objective compound I may be transformed into another group while thecompound I retains the 1 sulfa group, which leads to the formation of another objective compound of thisinvention. For instance, if R is acetoxymethyl, methanesulfonyloxymethyl, iodomethyl or the like, it can betransformed into another desired group by the reaction with a nucleophilic reagent. The nucleophilicagents that can be used include, for example, alkyl thiols, aryl thiols, heterocycle thiols, pyridines andthe like and they can provide the objective compounds I wherein R is a substituted thiomethyl, aquaternary ammonium methyl or the like. The alkyl , aryl , heterocyclic group and quaternaryammonium in these nucleophilic agents are as defined above. The reaction is preferably carried out in anaqueous solution, or in a water miscible solvent such as acetone, acetonitrile, N,N dimethylformamide orthe like, or a mixture of water and such water miscible solvent. There are cases in which the addition of abase such as an alkali carbonate, an alkali phosphate or the like is beneficial. The reaction is usuallyconducted at a temperature in the range of 20 to 100 C. The resulting compound I can be isolated andpurified by a procedure known When the objective compound I thus obtained has a protective group, the protective group can beremoved if necessary. Removal of such protective group can be accomplished by a conventional methodsuch as the one involving the use of an acid, a base or hydrazine, reduction, and the method comprising theuse of an iminohalogenating agent and, then, an iminoetherifying agent, if necessary, followed byhydrolysis. The choice of any such method depends on the particular protective group to be removed.When the protective group is removed with an acid, the acids that can be used include inorganic acids suchas hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc. and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid,trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, etc. as well as acidic ion exchangeresins, and the choice of acid depends on the particular protective group and other conditions. Inthe case in which the protective group is removed with a base, the bases that can be used include inorganicbases such as alkali metal e.g., sodium, potassium, etc. or alkaline earth metal e.g. calcium, magnesium,etc. hydroxides, carbonates, etc. and organic bases such as metal alkoxides, organic amines, quaternaryammonium salts, etc. as well as basic ion exchange resins, and the choice of base depends on theparticular protective group and other conditions. When the removal of a protective group with an acid or base is conducted in a solvent, an hydrophilicorganic solvent, water or a mixed solvent is generally used. When the protective group is removed by reduction, for example, the reduction with a combination ofa metal such as tin or zinc or a metal compound such as chromium dichloride or chromium acetate and anorganic or inorganic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid or hydrochloric acid, catalytic reduction in thepresence of a metal hydrogenation catalyst or the like may be employed depending on the particularprotective group and other conditions. The catalysts that can be used in the catalytic reduction include, forexample, platinum catalysts such as platinum wire, platinum sponge, platinum black, platinum oxide,colloidal platinum, etc., palladium catalysts such as palladium sponge, palladium black, palladium oxide,palladium on barium sulfate, palladium on barium carbonate, palladium on charcoal, palladium on silicagel, colloidal palladium, etc., nickel catalysts such as reduced nickel, nickel oxide, Raney nickel, Urushiharanickel, etc. and the like. In the case of reduction with a metal and an acid, a metal compound of such metal as iron, chromiumor the like and an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid or an organic acid such as formic acid, acetic acidor propionic acid are used. The removal of a protective group by reduction is usually conducted in asolvent, and the solvent which is conveniently used in the catalytic reduction includes, for example,alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propyl alcohol, isopropylalcohol, etc., ethyl acetate and the like. Thereduction with a metal and an acid is conveniently conducted in water, acetone or the like, but if the acid isliquid, it can also function as a solvent. In any of the methods involving the use of an acid or a base or reduction, the reaction is usually carriedout under cooling to under warming. When the protective group is removed by reacting an iminohalogenating agent and then animinoetherifying agent, if necessary, followed by hydrolysis, the iminohalogenating agents that can beused include, for example, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus tribromide,phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl chloride, phosgene, etc. The reaction temperature is not critical, but thereaction is usually conducted at room temperature to under cooling. The resulting reaction product is then reacted with an iminoetherifying agent including alcohols and metal alkoxides. The alcohols includealkanols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, tert butanol, etc. as well as thosecompounds in which the alkyl moieties of the above mentioned alcohols are substituted with an alkoxygroup such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy or the like. The metal alkoxides include alkalimetal alkoxides such as sodium alkoxides, potassium alkoxides, etc. and alkaline earth alkoxides such ascalcium alkoxides, barium alkoxides, etc. derived from such alcohols as above. In the case, for example, where the protective group is a residue of an organic carboxylic acid and asubstituent such as free amino, hydroxyl, mercapto, carboxyl or sulfa group is attached to the carbon atomadjacent to the carbonyl of the carboxylic residue, it is advantageous to carry out a preliminary treatmentfor enhancing the adjacent group effect of such substituent to increase the reactivity of the carbonyl groupprior to the deprotecting reaction. This will be illustrated, for example, with the case where the substituenton the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is a free amino group. In such a case, the protective group can beremoved by transforming the amino group into a thioureido group followed by deacylation, or byapplication of any other known method for cleaving a peptide linkage. The temperature at which thereaction is carried out is not critical and is selected depending on the particular protective group anddeprotecting method, although it is preferred to carry out the reaction under mild conditions such as undercooling to under warming. In the above mentioned reactions, when R and or R The deprotected compound I thus obtained may be converted into a desired salt in a conventionalmanner as mentioned above. Compound I , containing a sulfa group, generally can react with a base to form salts. Thus, compound I may be obtained as a salt, and the salt thus obtained may further be converted into the free form or intoanother salt. Compound I obtained in the free form may be converted into its salt. Compound I in theform of a salt can be converted into the free form, for example, using an acid. As the acid, for example, aninorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, or an organic acid such as formicacid, acetic acid or p toluenesulfonic acid is advantageously employed depending on the particular salt andother conditions. Alternatively, an acidic ion exchange resin or the like may be used. As a solvent, ahydrophilic organic solvent such as acetone, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, dioxane or the like, wateror a mixed solvent is generally employed. The reaction is usually carried out at room temperature, but itmay be carried out under cooling or under warming. The reaction time depends on the particular acid andsolvent employed and the reaction temperature selected, and it is generally preferred that the reaction becompleted in a short period. The resulting compound I in the free form can be isolated in a known manneras described above.

The liquid or solid unit dosage form compositionscontain the active substance in concentrations of 0.5 99 , preferably about 13 60 . The compositionsgenerally contain about 15 1500 mg of the active ingredient. However, doses within the range of about250 1000 mg are generally suited. The desired compounds III of this aspect of the invention or salts or esters thereof can be producedby sulfonating compounds I or salts thereof followed by removing the protective group and, if necessary,the ester residue. The starting compounds I are used in the free form or in the form of salts such as mentioned forcompounds III . The sulfonation reaction involves the introduction of a sulfa group into the 1 position ofcompounds I or salts thereof by reacting compounds I or salts thereof with sulfuric anhydride sulfurtrioxide or a functional derivative thereof, for instance. The functional derivative of sulfuric anhydrideincludes, for example, such adducts as sulfuric anhydride pyridine, sulfuric anhydride picoline, sulfuricanhydride lutidine, sulfuric anhydride N,N dimethylformamide, sulfuric anhydride dioxane, sulfuricanhydride trimethylamine and sulfuric anhydride chlorosulfonic acid as well as such mixtures as sulfuricacid acetic anhydride. In the above sulfonation reaction, sulfuric anhydride or a functional derivativethereof is used in an amount of about 1 10 moles, preferably about 1 5 moles per mole of compound I .The reaction temperature is about 20 C to about 80 C, preferably 0 60 C. The use of a solvent isgenerally preferred and the solvent includes water and commonly used organic solvents such as ethers e.g. dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether , esters e.g. ethyl acetate, ethyl formate , halogenatedhydrocarbons e.g. chloroform, dichloromethane , hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, n hexane andamides e.g. N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide , either alone or in admixture. Dependingon the kind of starting material I , sulfonating agent, reaction temperature and kind of solvent, the reactiongenerally proceeds to completion in a few scores of minutes to a few scores of hours. In some cases,several days may be required for completion of the reaction. After the reaction, the reaction product can berecovered by any of purification and separation procedures known The thus obtained sulfonation products, upon removal of the protective group and, if necessary, theester residue, give the desired products. The ester residue to be removed if necessary includes thoseresidues generally used as the carboxyl protecting groups and easily removable after the sulfonationreaction and may be removed simultaneously with the removal of the amino protecting group R orbefore or after the removal of said amino protecting group. Some of the above mentioned amino protectingand carboxyl protecting groups, depending on the kind thereof, may be removed under theabove mentioned sulfonation reaction conditions, and, in such a case, no separate protective groupremoval step is required. The removal of the amino protecting and carboxyl protecting groups can beeffected, for example, with an acid or base, or by reduction, depending on the protective groups species.When an acid is used, the acid which should be selected depending on the protective group species andother factors is, for example, such an inorganic acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid, such anorganic acid as formic, acetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, benzenesulfonic or p toluenesulfonic acid, or anacid form ion exchange resin. When a base is used, the base which should be selected depending on theprotective group species and other factors is, for example, such an inorganic base as a hydroxide orcarbonate of an alkali metal e.g. sodium, potassium or an alkaline earth metal e.g. calcium, magnesium ,such an organic base as a metal alkoxide, an organic amine or a quaternary ammonium salt, or a base formion exchange resin. When a solvent is used for the protective group removal, the solvent is in most cases ahydrophilic organic solvent, water or a mixture thereof. When the removal is effected by reduction, thereduction is carried out, depending on the protective group species and other factors, by using such a metal as tin or zinc or such a metal compound as chromium dichloride or chromium acetate together with suchan organic or inorganic acid as acetic, propionic or hydrochloric acid, or catalytically in the presence of ametal catalyst for catalytic reduction. The catalyst for use in the catalytic reduction includes among othersplatinum catalysts such as platinum wire, platinum sponge, platinum black, platinum oxide and colloidalplatinum, palladium catalysts such as palladium sponge, palladium black, palladium oxide, palladium on bariumsulfate, palladium on barium carbonate, palladium on carbon, palladium on silica gel and colloidalpalladium, and nickel catalysts such as reduced nickel, nickel oxide, Raney nickel and Urushibara nickel.When a combination of a metal and an acid is used, a compound of such a metal as iron or chromium onone hand and such an inorganic acid as hydrochloric acid or such an organic acid as formic, acetic orpropionic acid on the other are used. The reductive method is generally carried out in a solvent. In catalyticreduction, for instance, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol as well asethyl acetate or the like are used frequently. In performing the method using a metal and an acid, thesolvent is most frequently water or acetone or the like, and, when the acid is a liquid, the acid itself may beused as the solvent. The reaction in the acid treatment, base treatment or reduction procedure is generallycarried out with or without cooling or warming. For removing a silyl containing protective group, a fluorideion containing compound such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride or potassium fluoride may also be used.When the amino protecting group is monochloroacetyl, removal thereof can easily be performed by using,for example, thiourea or sodium N methyl dithiocarbamate. The desired compounds of this aspect of the invention can also be produced by reacting compound A or a salt or ester thereof with carboxylic acid II or a functional derivative thereof followed byremoving the protective group and, if necessary, the ester residue. Compounds A may be used either in the free form or in the form of salts or esters such as mentionedfor compounds III . Carboxylic acids II are used either in the free acid form or in the form of functionalderivatives, with respect to the carboxyl group. The functional derivatives of carboxylic acids II are, forexample, acid halides, acid anhydrides, active amides, active esters and active thioesters. Examples ofthese functional derivatives are given below Such acid halides as acid chlorides and acid bromides are used. Such acid anhydrides as mixed acid anhydrides with, for example, monoalkyl carbonic acids, aliphaticcarboxylic acids e.g. acetic, pivalic, valeric, isovaleric, trichloroacetic acid or aromatic carboxylic acids e.g. benzoic acid as well as symmetric acid anhydrides. Amides with pyrazole, imidazole, 4 substituted imidazole, dimethylpyrazole and benzotriazole, forinstance, are used. Such active esters as methyl ester, ethyl ester, methoxy methyl ester, propargyl ester, 4 nitrophenylester, 2,4 dinitrophenyl ester, trichlorophenyl ester, pentachlorophenyl ester, mesylphenyl ester and esterswith 1 hydroxy 1H 2 pyridone, N hydroxysuccinimide and N hydroxyphthalimide, among others, are used. Thioesters, for example, with thiols such as heterocycle thiols e.g. 2 pyridinethiol, 2 benzothiazolylthiol,etc. Preferable one of said thioesters is a compound of the formula A functional derivative adequate for each specific instance is selected from among the above mentionedderivatives depending on the kinds of R , R and R in carboxylic acid II . In practicing the above method, compound A or a salt or ester thereof is first reacted with carboxylicacid II or a functional derivative thereof in a proportion of 1 mole of the former to at least 1 mole,preferably 1 4 moles of the latter. The reaction is generally carried out in a solvent. The solvent includeswater, acetone, dioxane, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, chloroform, dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran,ethyl acetate, N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, pyridine and other common organicsolvents inert to the reaction. Hydrophilic solvents may be used in admixture with water. When carboxylicacid II is used in the free form, the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a condensingagent, such as, for example, N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N cyclohexyl N morpholinoethylcarbodiimide,N cyclohexyl N 4 diethylaminocyclohexyl carbodiimide or N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide.The reaction may also be conducted in the presence of such a base as an alkali metalcarbonate, a trialkylamine e.g. trimethylamine, triethylamine, tributylamine, N methylmorpholine, N methylpiperidine ,N,N dialkylaniline, N,N dialkylbenzylamine, pyridine, picoline, lutidine, 1,5 diazabicyclo 4,3,O non 5 ene,1,4 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane or 1,8 diazabicyclo 5,4,4 undecene 7. Whenthe base or condensing agent is a liquid, it may also serve as the solvent. The reaction temperature is notcritical but, generally, the reaction is carried out in many cases with cooling or at room temperature. Thereaction is complete in several minutes to a few scores or hours. Especially, when an active thioester of thecompound II is used, the used amount thereof is preferably 1 2 moles per 1 mole of the compound A .In the use of the active thioester, a preferable solvent is a halogenated alkane such as methylene chloride,etc., and as a base, for example, an trialkylamine such as trimethylamine, etc. is advantageously used. Thereaction temperature and time are 0 40 C and a few minutes to several hours, respectively, to gain a goodresult in this case. The reaction product can be recovered and purified by The product yielded by the above acylation reaction is then used as the starting material in the step ofremoving the protective group and, if necessary, the ester residue. This removal step is carried out in thesame manner as the previously mentioned step of removing the protective group and, if necessary, theester residue following the sulfonation. Furthermore, the compounds of this aspect of the present invention can also be produced, forexample, by reacting compound A , for example a compound of the formula The final products of this aspect of the present invention, namely compounds III , obtained after theremoval of the protective group and, if necessary, the ester residue are isolated and purified by Among the salts of the compound III , a salt with a nontoxic cation, especially mono or di sodium saltis desirable. Di sodium salt of the compound III can be unexpectedly recovered in crystalline form whichis highly stable in storage and has high water solubility. Crystalline di sodium salt of the compound III may be prepared, for example, by bringing non crystalline di sodium salt of the compound III intocontact with water vapor until 0.2 0.7 time weight of water to the salt has been absorbed, by condensingan aqueous solution of di sodium salt of the compound III until the water content has become 0.2 0.7time weight to the salt, by adding an organic solvent to an aqueous solution of di sodium salt of thecompound III , or the like. As an organic solvent, use is made of a water miscible solvent, e.g. alcoholssuch as methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol or n butanol, ketones such as acetone or methyl ethylketone, nitriles such as acetonitrile or propionitrile, ethers such as diethylether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane,or a mixture thereof, etc. The volume to be used of solvent is not limited as far as the purpose is attained.Usually, it is 1 to 100 parts per 1 part of the aqueous solution. The preparation of said crystals is normallyconducted at the temperature in the range of 0 40 C, preferably 10 35 C, more preferably 15 30 C. At alower temperature than 0 C, the crystals grow too slowly, while at a higher temperature than 40 C, thestarting material or and the product decompose, and the recovery yield of crystallization decreases. Thetime required to form crystals varies according to the purity of the starting material, solvent, method forpreparing crystals, temperature and so on.
