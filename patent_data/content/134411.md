# Energy discriminator, for example a colour vidicon.

## Abstract
In a vidicon, optical energy enters through a transparent receiving surface 37 into a multilayer semiconductor monocrystalline body in which it is converted into hole electron pair carriers in different particular overlying energy responsive layers 12, 13, 14 and the electrons thereof are collected in potential wells associated with the particular layer. Each pixel is isolated from adjoining pixels by isolation regions 20, 22 , and readout contacts 26, 27, 29 for the layers are separated by isolation regions 28, 30 .
