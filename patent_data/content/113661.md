## Description
1.Miron Tuval 2. Andre Wexler Ramat Gan 52 383, Israel Bnei Brak 51 407, Israel Modular Roadway Construction tthod and Prefabricated Units Therefor9 The present invention concerns novel structural elements and their use in construction in general including the construction of roads, runways, motorways, viaducts, aqueducts and the like, all to be referred to collectively as roadways . In the following the utilization of structural elements according to the invention will be described mainly with respect to the construction of roadways, it being understood that the utilization of the said structural elements is not restricted thereto. In recent years the rate of construction of new roadways is ever increasing, both for the expansion of existing networks of motorways and for establishing roadway networks in areas where until now there have almost been no modern roadways. At the same time the cost for the construction of roadways is also ever increasing, the contributing factors being the cost of labour, the cost for the preparation of the ground on which the roads run by grading and or filling so that a relatively smooth substrate is prepared for the roadway surface, and the cost of the materials required for roadway surfacing which is in particular high when the surface has to be adapted for heavy duty.Taking the case of a road, depending on the economics of the area where the road is being constructed, either a large labour force is used for preparing the ground or large amounts of heavy construction equipment are used, or both. The cost of the road increase of course even more where, for example, the road is laid across a swamp area or along a waterfront. Thus swhere the roadway goes through a swamp area, then to prepare the ground for the road it is necessary to drain the swamp, fill the drained area and level andfor grade the fill.In case of a roadway that is to run along a waterfront Where the soil is usually very soft and the ground water level is close to the surface, the problas are even more complex tnd special means are required to keep away the ground water Many times in fact the cost of placing a road across a swamp area or elon a waterfront is so high that an alternative route around the wet area is chosen even though this is also extremely expensive. The need for careful levelling and grading of the ground before laying a road surface could be obviated if the road surface were te be made of a heavy duty mass that is resistant to the forces to which it is subjected in use even if supported from below only at selected pcints and not over the entire lower face. Such a surface mass could be laid directly on an uneven ground cr mounted on pillars so as to be in fact supported at selective spots only rather than over the entire lower face and still withstand all the forces acting on the upper face thereof.The only known material that would practically come into consideration for such requirements would be massive reinforced concrete but the material and handling costs of such a roadway surface are so high as to cancel out any saving achieved by not fully or not at all levelling and grading the ground. Thus, while the idea is theretically sound it could hitherto not be practically realised. The need for heavy duty highly resistant structural elements arises also in connection with other forms of civil engineering such as the construction of buildings, factory halls, bridges, aqueducts, viaducts for railways, etc. It is an object of the present invention to provide heavyduty stress resistant structural elements that are lighter and cheaper than conventional structural elements of similar size and mechanical properties. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new method for the construction of roadways making use of the new structural elements according to the invention. In accordance with the invention there is provided a struc tural element comprising a rigid shell, a free flowing filler material within the shell and at least one reinforcing rod or cable extending across the filler and tying at least two opposite walls of the shell. The free flowing filler material of a structural element according to the invention may be granular solid, e.g. sand clay and the like or a liquid such as water, Where the filler is a freeflowing granular material such as sand, it is preferably moistened by liquid lubricant, e.ge water, which enables to maximize the dense packing of the filler. Structural elements according to the invention may be in the forni of slabs, panels, beams, blocks, walls, pillars with or.with out headplates, etce The reinforcing rods or cables in structural elementsaccording to the invention may be prestressed, post stressed or not stressed at all. It has been found that structural elements according to the invention are extremely strong. If concrete is used in the shell the amount of concrete required is about half or even less than that needed for conventional structural elements of similar size and mechanical properties and at the same time are also less expensive to make. These unique properties are due to the action of the filler which co acts with the shell to withstand the compressive forces that act upon it. The filler material whether free flowing granular or liquid, acts as a high viscosity liquid for transmitting forces in all directions, thereby to spread the compressive forces exerted thereon by transmission from the shell. The shell may be of any suitable rigid material having the desired mechanical properties such as, for example, concrete, iron, steel, aluminium and the like. The structural elements according to the invention may be prefabricated or may be made in situ, Whether the one or the other way is preferred will depend on the surrounding circumstances such as size of the elements and their cost of transportation0 For the manufacture of a unit according to the invention it is possible to first cast the shell without one of its walls with the reinforcing cable s or rod s anchored in one or more existing walls. The rod s or cable s may be prestressed or post stressed or remain unstressed as may be required0 This is then followed by the insertion of the filler, at which stage the open side of the structure is uppermost.During the insertion of the filler the still open element is preferably placed on a vibrator which in case of a granular filler ensures dense packing and in the case of a liquid filler such as water, ensures the escape of air bubbles. When the filler has been fully inserted and compacted or degased, as the case may be, the missing wall is applied to the element. Where the shell is of concrete, some of the moisture of the wet filler or some of the filler water is taken up by the concrete during setting. Slabs according to the invention can be used to advantage for the construction of roadways. By one method the slabs according to the invention are placed directly on the ground. Where this method is practised the ground will have to be prepared somewhat but to a much lesser degree of refinement than in conventional roadway construction techniques. Another method of constructing a roadway in accordance with the invention comprises implanting prefabricated pillars in the ground to protrude from the ground at a desired height and placing slabs according to the invention on such pillars, The pillars may comprise headplates for better supporting the slabs. If desired, beams may be used and placed.across adjacent pillars with or without head portions and the slabs according to the invention are then placed on such beams. Any pillars and beams used in the performance of constructions in accordance with the invention may themselves be constructional elements according to the invention or else they may be conventional, e.g. of reinforced concrete or steel. The pillars and beams are preferably prefabricated while the slabs may be prefabricated or be made in situ, depending on their size Prefabricated pillars used for the construction of roadways in accordance with the invention may be of modular design, that is they may be so designed that one fits on top of the other in a manner such that the plurality form a practically integral pillar without change of static characteristics. Accordingly a plurality of such pillars can be joined together to form an integral pillar of the desired height0 In a roadway according to the invention built on pillars, the pillars act as the foundation and as supporting columns at the same time. With the aid of such modular pillars it is possible to provide any desired grading by varying the extent of protrusion of the pillars from the ground in accordance with a desired pattern.In this way a graded, sloping roadway is produced In the construction of a roadway in accordance with the invention using pillars the underground portion of the pillars is so shaped as to fulfil the function of piles or poles. Such pillars are preferably placed in the ground with the aid of a vibrating implanter which forces the pillars into the ground to the desired protrusion height0 On the protruding portion of the pillars connecting plates may be placed and sustaining pillars may then be mounted on the connecting plates and slabs be placed thereon.In any way the bottom part of the slabs stays clear of the highest topographical protrusion of the ground and this way the need for ground preparation is generally eliminated. Preferably the slabs are so designed that juxtaposed slabs interenciage, e.gO by way of interlock or overlap of end and or side portions. The invention is illustrated by way of example only in the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view, partly torn open, of a slab according to the invention Fig. 2 is a longitudinal section along line II II ofFig. 1 drawn to a larger scale Fig. 3 is a section along line TII III of Fig. 2 Figv 4 is a diagrammatic sectional view of a phase in the production of a slab according to Figs0 1 to 3 Fig 5 is a section through a pillar according to the invention taken along line V V of Fig0 6 Fig. 6 is a section along line VI VI of Fig. Fig. 7 is a pictorial view of different roadways constructed in accordance with the invention and Figs. 8, 9 and 10 are perspective views of respectively a modular beam, a modular pillar and a modular edgebeam all for use in the perfozmance of construction methods according to the invention. Slab 1 according to the invention shown in Fig. 1 comprises a main portion 2 and a set off end portion 3 that serves for overlap with a correspondingly shaped end portion of another slab according to the invention. The slab is made of a concrete shell 4, a compact granular filler material 5, e.g. wet sand with a moisture content of 10 20 by weight, and a plurality of rows of reinforcing rods or struts 6, each such row heing arranged in this particular case in the forum of recurring V shaped segments. The shell 4 comprises an expanded metal grid 7 embedded therein as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The wet sand used as filler in the embodiment of Figs. 1.to 3 may be replaced by other materials such as clay, by a flowing wet mass such as grout or by 2 pure liquid such as water. Depending on size and logistic considerations, a slab of the kind of Figs. 1 to 3 r.ay be prefabricated or produced in situ.It can be made large, e.g. about 100 m0 long, and slabs of such a size will obviously have to be produced in situ0 Such large slabs are used for placing directly on the ground. For other applications, such as pillar supported roadways, w all construction and the like, smaller slabs will be used. In order to prevent corrosion of the reinforcing rods or struts these may be enclosed in cells 66 created by the provision of two partitions extending across the width of the slab and separating then said rods or struts from the filler material 5. One way of producing a slab according to Figs. 1 to 3 is illustrated in Fig. 4. As shown a trough shaped concrete shell 9 with an expanded metal grid 10 embedded therein is cast in a form assembly comprising an outer form 11 and an insert 12, the latter being shown in Fig. 4 in the extracted position. At first the bottnm plate of shell 9 is cast in rorm 11 with an expanded metal grid embedded therein and a plurality of reinforcing rods 14 anchored in the bottom plate in the manner sho.Yn. Thereafter the insert 12 is inserted and the side walls of the shell 9 are cast in the spaces between fonn 11 and insert 12, again with an expanded metal grid embedded therein.Before or after the setting of shell 9 a filler material 15, e.g. wet sand, is poured into the shell and then insert 12 is removed. If desired the shell 9 may be extracted from fount 11 prior to the introduction of the filler arterial 15. After the filler material 15 has been poured in, the shell 9 either within form 11 or after removal therefrom, is placed on a vibrator in order to compact the filler and thereafter an upper concrete plate with an expanded metal grid enibedded therein is cast on top of the filled shell 9 so that the apexes of grid 14 or rods 6, as the case may be, become embedded in the upper plate similar as the lower apexes are embedded in the bottom of shell 9. The pillar according to the invention shown in Figs. 5 and 6 comprises a pole 17 and a headplate 13. Pole 17 is of con ventional design, e.g. massive, reinforced concrete. Headplate 18 comprises a concrete shell 19 and a filler mass 20, eOg. of wet sand or sclid concrete. Inside shell 19 there are two rows of identical, satellite boxes 21a to 25a and 21b to 25b, all of which are filled with a filler material which may be the same or different from the filler material 20. The boxes 21a, 23a and 25a accomodate concrete filled tubes 2fa to 3Oa and likewise boxes 21b, 23b and 25b accoinodate concrete filled tubes 26b to 30b. Each of the concrete filled tubes 26a through 30a and 26b through 3Ob acco.C.odates a vertical reinforcing rod such as, for example, rod 31 in box 21b and rod 32 in box 25b. All the vertical reinforcing rods such as rod 31 and 32 are thus sheathed and they extend through a filler between two opposite walls of the headplate 18, namely the top and the bottom walls. Preferably the vertical reinforcing rods are post stressed. The headplate 18 further comprises two horizontal tubes 34, 35 both filled with concrete accomodating respectively reinforcing ros 36 and 37. These two reinforcing rods are thus also sheathed similar as all vertical reinforcing rods and they extend between two opposite side walls of the concrete shell across the filler 20.Preferably reinforcing rods 36 and 37 are also post stressed. The headplate 18 according to the invention weighs less and in the case of sand filler is about 30 less expensive than a headplate of massive reinforced concrete with the same mechanical properties. If desired the headplate 18 may be adapted for standing thereon other structural elements, eOgo block shaped elements of similar construction as headplate 18. but higher Where this is practiced the vertical reinforcing rods such as rods 31 and 32 shown in Figs. 5 and 6 will pass through all stacked elements connecting them to each other0 This means that the vertical rods will be positioned only after the elements are stacked and they may, if desired, be post stressed. The ensuing vertical assez.bly may be capped by another headplate similar to plate 18 andthevertical rods are anchored in the lowermost and upennost plates thus holding together all the elements stacked on the lowernost headplate 18. In this way an integral pillar may be produced in which the vertical tying rods may be post strssed. Where a more massive pillar is required it ispossible to juxtapose in an interengaoing manner two or more pillars and headplates of the kind shown in Figs0 5 and 6 with horizontal rods such as rods 36 and 37 connecting the juxtaposed headplates 18.Here again rods 36 and 37 may be post stressed. The pictorial illustration of Fig. 7 shows by way of example some surface ways that can be constructed in accordance with the invention. For example at 40 there is a graded roadway starting at a level and rising to a height while 41 shows the sur faceway being used as a landing strip and 42 shows the component parts of a surfaceway being used as a viaduct to hold rails for railroad vehicles. At 43 there is shown a ground depression bridged by a roadway 44. The main component parts of the roadway shown in Fig. 7 are modular pillars shown in tl.n different forms as pillars 45 and 46 modular beams which are shown in two different forms, modular beam 47 and modular beam 48, and the slabs 490 The pillars 45 and 46 may have a head portion according to the invention of the Kind shown in Figsç 5 and 6 and slabs 49 may for example be in the form shown in Figs. 1 to 3o Grading utilized in the system is controlled by monitoring the amount by which the pillars protrude from the ground. The nodular pillars are placed one on tcp of the other to obtain the desired height. Thus for example in the roadway 40 a single pillar is shown at 50 while pillars 46 are each made out of two modular portions.In this way the roadway climbs to the desired height at a desired Slope, Fig0 8 shows a beam 52 that can be used in the construction of a roadway with slabs and pillars according to the invention. It has an inverted T shaped profile and two hollow channels 53 and 54 which if desired may be filled with a filler material or else serve for the accommodation of functional elements such as, for example, electric cables and wires. Shoulders 55 and 56 serve for receiving the end portions of the slabs such as slab 1 of Fig. 1. The modular pillar 57 shown in Fig.9 comprises at one end a socket 58 and at the other end a protuberance 59 whereby it is adapted for interlocking alignment with similar modular pillars.However the pillar 57 may also be directly fixed in the ground and may support at its top a slab such as slab 1 of Figs. 1 to 3, either directly or with the interposition of other structural elements such as a headplat or a beam. Beam 60 of Fig. 10 is an edge beam. Similar as beam 52 of Fig. 8 it comprises channels 61 and 62 and a shoulder 63 while the other shoulder in the beam of Fig. 8 is replaced here by a wall portion 64. The structural elements of Figs. 8 to 10 may or may not be madp. in accordance with thp. invention0 In any event they are useful for constructing roadways using slabs and pillar heads according to the invention of the kind described hereinbefore. For constructina a roadway with slabs according to the invention on pillars a vibrating unit may be used to force the pillars into the ground surface that does not have to be prepared in any manner. The vibrating unit forces the pillars into the ground to the desired protrusion height0 The height may be measured with any suitable instrument such as a laser altitude measuring device which is accurate and easily utilized. One or more pillars can be placed on top of an inset pillar to obtain the height desired for the roadway.When a number of pillars are placed in position beams are placed over the pillars and or the pillars are fitted with headplates, e.g. as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The new methods of roadway construction with slabs and other structural elements according to the invention are extremely versatile and cost effective since almost the entire roadway is prefabricated or made from elements fabricated in situ. Where pillars are used the roadway runs overhead the topmost topographical protrusion so that no ground surface preparation is necessary at all. Where slabs are placed directly on the ground some ground preparation is required but to a much lesser degree than in conventional road construction methods. While the principles of the invention have been described above in connection with specific apparatus and applications, it is to be understood that this description is made by way of example only and not as a limitation on the scope of the invention.
