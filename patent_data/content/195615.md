# CABLE BRANCH OFF SEAL

## Abstract
A cable branch off sealing member and a method of making a cable branch off seal using the sealing member. In the method, a heat shrinkable material is wrapped around two closely spaced parallel cables and pinched together between the cables to one side of the cables to create a loop of heat shrink material between the cables. The cable sealing member has an elongate tongue smoothly tapered at its leading end for insertion into the loop of heat shrinkable sheet material, which tongue has a width greater than the spacing between the cables to bridge between the peripher ies of the cables and is bowed centrally of its width along its length to cause the two layers of heat shrink material to bow outward midway between the cables. A narrow tail is connected to the trailing end of the tongue generally midway of the width of the tongue and extends perpendicular to the length of the tongue to extend into the space between the peripheries of the cables to maintain the spacing between the cables and to keep the tongue generally centered between the cables as the heat shrink material is heated and shrunk. The nmarrow tail has smooth surfaces for contacting the cables to assure that it will not damage the cable sheaths during the heat shrinking process.
