Preferably, it is conducted using 2,3 dihydropyran in methylene chloride in the presence of pyridine p toluenesulfonate or p toluenesulfonic acid at room temperature. The steps b and c , are acylations which may be carried out as hereinbefore described for the preparation of the compounds represented, respectively, by the general formulae Ie and Id . Step d is a carbamoylation reaction, which may be conducted by reacting the compounds of the general formula XIV or XVII with phenyl chloroformate at a temperature of O C, in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl ether orN,N dimethylformamide preferably dimethyl ether , in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or pyridine, and then with liquid ammonia or a compound represented by the formulaEMI30.1 wherein R6 and R7 are as hereinbefore described, at a temperature of 780C. The step e is a reaction in which the OR12 group is converted into a hydroxyl group. This reaction may be carried out as described in Protective Groups in OrganicSynthesis published by John Wiley Sons,Inc. USA ,page 39 50 1981 hereinafter referred to as Reference A . This reaction is preferably conducted by using tetrabutylammoniw1 fluoride n BuqN F in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. The step f is a reaction to convert the hydroxy group into an oxo group and, in addition to eliminate the OT group to form a double bond between C9 C10. Such an oxidation reaction is well known, and is described in detail in, for example, a Synthetic Organic Chemistry III, Organic Synthesis 1 , pp. 176 206 compiled by Tetsuji Kameya and published by Nankodo Japan on Aug. 1, 1976 , or, b Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods , vol.1, vol. 2, and vol.3, section 48 or 168 published by JohnWiley Sons, Inc. USA in 1971, 1974, and 1977, respectively .

The Collins oxidation may be conducted in a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform, methylene chloride or carbon tetrachloride at a temperature of from room temperature to OOC. The Jones oxidation is generally conducted at a temperature of not higher than room temperature. The Swern oxidation may be conducted by reaction in a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform or methylene chloride at a temperature of from 500C to 600C, and then treatment with triethylamine. The compounds of the general formulae XIV and XVII in Schemes B and C, which are employed as starting materials, may be prepared according to the sequence of reaction steps illustrated in Scheme D, wherein all of the symbols are as hereinbefore defined. Scheme D EMI33.1 All the steps in Scheme D are conducted by known methods. Step g , for example, is a reaction in which the hydroxyl group at the ll position is selectively converted into OR12. Such reactions are described in detail in Reference A. Preferably, it is conducted by reaction with a chlorosilane compound represented by the formula Cl R12 wherein R12 is as hereinbefore defined , in dimethylaminopyridine or dimethylformamide, in the presence of a base such as pyridine, imidazole or triethylamine, at a temperature of from room temperature to 500C. The reaction must be carried out carefully to avoid conversion of the hydroxyl group attached to the 9 position into a group ORÚê. The step h is a reaction in which the hydroxyl group attached to the 9 position is converted into a group OR9. This step may be conducted as in the step a . In step i the hydroxyl group attached to the 9 position is converted into a group OT. This reaction may be conducted by reaction with an alkylsulfonyl chloride such as mesyl chloride or arylsulfonyl chloride such as tosl chloride i in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride, in the presence of a tertiary amine such as pyridine or triethylamine or ii in pyridine, at a temperature of from 30 C to 500C. The step j is a reducing reaction in which the COOCH3 group is converted into the CH20H group. This reaction may be conducted by any suitable reducing agent, preferably diisobu ylaluminium hydride DIBAL in an inert organic solvent such as hexane, tetrahydrofuran or toluene, at a temperature of from 0 C to 300C. The compounds of the general formula XX are known compounds and disclosed as chemical products represented by the general formula XXIII in the specification of European Patent Publication No. 0098141. Cyclodextrin clathrates of the prostaglandin D analogues of general formula I can be prepared using a F or y cyclodextrins or a mixture thereof, using the procedure described in Japanese Patent No. 790979 andJapanese Patent Application OPI No. 39057 72.
