# PISTON PUMP

## Abstract
A pump cylinder 18 is driven in reciprocation relative to a hollow piston 22 within the cylinder. The piston and cylinder each have valved inlet ports 33, 34 43, 44 at each end. A tu bular member 14 communicates with the hollow of the piston centrally between the piston ends and extends perpendicular to the piston, serving further as a stationary pivot for oscillation of the piston while the cylinder is driven in a swinging recipro cation relative to the piston. The tubular member extends through and works relative to a slot 19 formed through the cylinder wall so that reciprocation of the cylinder pumps a fluid along a flow path through the valved inlet ports and along said tubular member. The cylinder is driven at low speed by a motor 15 through a gear box 16 rigidly secured to a tubular frame 71 of the pump. A number of piston and cylinder devices may be driven by a common drive means, and employ a common tubular member, in a modular arrangement. The pump is sim ple, reliable and quiet, and is effective to provide small quanti ties of air at low pressure, e.g. for aeration at isolated effluent treatment plants and at fish farms.
