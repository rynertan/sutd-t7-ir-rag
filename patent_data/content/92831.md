## Description
OPTICAL FIBER GYRO BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an integrated optical fiber gyro. An optical fiber gyro for detecting rotational speed, utilizing the Sagnac effect, has various merits.More specifically, the optical fiber gyro is rigid against acceleration because it has no movable parts. Furthermore, it is high in sensitivity, excellent in linearity, simple in construction and low in power consumption. However, it has not been put in practical use. Figure 7 is a plan view showing the arrangement of a conventional optical fiber gyro.. As shown in Fig. 7, a single mode optical fiber 40 is wound several turns to form an optical fiber loop.Reference numeral 41 designates a laser. The laser beam is divided into two light beams by a half mirror 42.One of the two light beams is applied through a lens 43 to one end of the optical fiber 40, thus passing through the latter clockwise hereinafter referred to as the clockwise or CL beam , and the other is applied through a lens 44 to the other end of the optical fiber loop, thus passing through the latter counterclockwise hereinafter referred to as the counterclockwise or CCL beam . The two light beams passed through the optical fiber loop are then put together by the half mirror 42 in a manner such that the optical axes thereof coincide. The optical path of the clockwise light beam is equal in length to that of the counterclockwise beam. When the gyro is turned about a normal to the optical fiber loop at an angular velocity Q, the phase difference as between the two light beams is as 2 1 cA where L is the length of the optical fiber, a is the radius of the optical fiber, X is the wavelength of the laser beam, and c is the light velocity. The photo detector 45 provides an output proportional to the square of the sum of the clockwise light beam and the counterclockwise light beam. If the two light beams are equal in amplitude, then the output of the photodetector is proportional to 1 cos , as explained hereafter. Ideally, the amplitude of the clockwise light beam is equal to that of the counterclociwise light beam.The waves of the clockwise and counterclockwise light beams are represented by the following expressions 2 and 3 , respectively Eg ei t A0 2 2 E0ei wt 2 3 where is the light angular frequency.The output of the photo detector, being equal to the square of the sum of both, is I1 t alpha E0Ãª 1 cos 4 The output includes a term in cos A8. When AO is small, the variation of the co onent cos A6 is extremely small. That is, when A6is small, the sensitivity is low. Accordingly, it should be included, in the form of sin AO, in the output. An optical output in such a functional form can be obtained by employing an method in which two light beams are separated and one of the two light beams is shifted by 2 in phase. Figure 7 is a plan view showing a conventional optical fiber gyro of this type. Similarly as in Fig. 7, a light beam from a laser 41 is divided into two light beams by a beam splitter 42, and the two light beams are applied through condenser lenses 43 to both ends of a single mode optical fiber loop 40. The aforementioned beam splitter 42 and three additional beam splitters 46, 46 and 47 are arranged at the four corners of a square. The clockwise CW light beam passes along two opposed sides of the square, and the counterclockwise CCW light beam passes along the remaining two opposed sides. That is, the optical path for the CW light beam is separated from that for the CCW light beam. A phase shifter is inserted in one of the optical paths to shift the phase of the laser beam by w 2. The shifted wave can be represented by the following expression 5 instead of 3 E0ei t 2 A0 2 Expression 2 is added to expression 5 , and the result of addition is squared, so that the output 12 t of photodetector 45 is provided 12 t ego2 1 sin he 6 In the optical systems of Figs. 7 and 7a, the laser, the photo detector and the half mirrors are made up of ordinary optical components. Since the optical fiber gyro must have excellent vibration resistance, the optical components are fixed on a large, heavy bench by means of magnet stands. Accordingly, the optical fiber gyro is bulky, heavy and incovenient to handle as a whole, thus not being practical. Furthermore, the optical fiber gyro is disadvantageous in that it is rather difficult to adjust the optical axes, which are liable to shift. When the relative position of the laser, beam splitter, condenser lens and optical fiber varies, the coupling efficiency of the optical fiber is varied, and the output of the photo detector drifts accordingly. For the same reason, the overlapping part of the clockwise and counterclockwise light beams is changed in area on the photo detector, and accordingly the output of the photo detector drifts, making measurement unreliable. Even when a system of detecting 1 sin A8 is employed, the output drift due to the instability of the optical system cannot be distinguished from the variation of the phase difference AG, because the DC component of the photo detector output is observed. The drift results in the occurrence of an error in the measurement of AG. It is rather difficult to manufacture and assemble the conventional optical fiber gyro. In the conventional optical fiber gyro, the optical system is made up of discrete optical components.Accordingly, it is difficult to adjust the optical axis during assembly. It is also difficult to adjust the angle of the phase shifter. With the phase shifter in the conventional optical fiber gyro, the parallel glass plate is inclined to adjust the substantial thickness in the optical path direction, thereby to obtain the desired phase difference However, since the optical wavelength is extremely short, it is considerably difficult ot obtain the phase difference s 2 with high accuracy. Thus, when the glass plate is inclined, the output of the photo detector drifts. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, one object of this invention is to provide an optical fiber gyro eliminating the above problems, in one embodiment of which a laser diode, a photo diode, gratings and a modulating element are provided on one substrate,to modulate one light beam, whereby theS N ratio may be improved. Three modulation methods, namely, amplitude modulation, phase modulation and frequency shift modulation are available, and any one of these modulation methods may be employed in the invention. In an optical fiber gyro according to further embodiments, optical wave guides and a light branching element or elements are formed on one substrate by a photolithographic technique, and the light emitting element and the light receiving element are integral with the substrate. In a further fiber gyro of the invention,optical wave guides, light branching elememts, a phase shifter, etc. are formed on one substrate having an electro optic effect by photolithography, and a light emitting element and a light receiving element are bonded to the end faces of the substrate or formed on the substrate, so that the optical systems are provided in monolithic form.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS This invention will now be described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the substrate of an optical fiber gyro according to a first embodiment of the invention. The substrate 1 has electro optic effects, and is formed of a crystal of GaAs, InP, LiNbO3, Bil2SiO20 or Bil2GeO20 etc. Optical wave guides 2, 3, 4 and 5 are formed on the substrate 1 in a manner such that they cross one another as shown in Fig. 1. A grating 6 serving as a half mirror is provided at th intersection of the two optical wave guides 2 and 5 such that it extends in the direction of the bisector of the angle formed by the two optical wave guides 2 and 5.Similarly, gratings 7, 8 and 9 serving as half mirrors are provided at the intersections of the optical waveguides 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and 4 and 5, respectively. Each grating, having a number of parallel lines arranged at equal intervals, can diffract a light beam of a predetermined wavelength. In this embodiment, each grating operates to bend a light beam from one optical wave guide to another. A laser diode 10 in the form of a chip is bonded to the starting end of the optical wave guide 5. The light beam from the laser diode 10 is divided into a clockwise light beam r and a counterclockwise light beam 1.The optical wave guide 5, in which the clockwise light beam r propagates, is partially deformed, or branches partially, to form a modulator 11 for light amplitude modulation. Fig. 4 is an enlarged plan view of the modulator.The optical wave guide 5 branches into optical wave guides 5a and 5b on which electrodes 12a and 12b are provided by vacuum evaporation, printing or other methods. A modulation signal generating IC integrated circuit 13 Fig. 1 is fixedly secured to the substrate. The IC 13 operates to apply a voltage to the electrodes 12a and 12b, to thereby change the refractive indexes of the optical wave guides 5a and 5b by the electro optic effect. In each of the optical wave guides 5a and 5b, the light velocity is inversely proportional to the refractive index. Accordingly, when different electric fields are applied to the optical wave guides 5a and 5b, the light velocity in the optical wave guide 5a is different from that in the optical wave guide 5b. The two optical wave guides 5a and 5b are thereafter joined into one optical wave guide however, the light beam passed through the former is different in phase from that passed through the latter.Accordingly, the amplitude of the combined light beams is not the simple sum of the amplitudes of the light beams from the two optical wave guides Sa and Sb. In the ideal case, the amplitude of the combined light beams is a function including the cosine of the phase difference . Accordingly, if the voltages applied to the two electrodes 12a and 12b are changed periodically so as to periodically change the phase difference , then the amplitude of the light beams passed through the optical wave guide branches 5a and Sb are periodically changed. The optical wave guide branches 5a and 5b form aMach Zehner interferometer. The clockwise light beam is subjected to amplitudemodulation by the modulator 11 as described. An optical element for applying an alternating electric field to optical wave guide branches to perform such amplitudemodulation is well known in the art. The counterclockwise light beam is not amplitude modulated. A photo diode 14 is bonded to one end of the optical wave guide 4, which is close to the intersection of the optical wave guides 4 and 3. The output of the photo diode 14 is amplified and suitably processed by a detection signal processing IC 15. The clockwise light beam r, after being modulated while passing through the optical wave guide 5, enters an optical fiber 16. The optical fiber 16 is wound several turns to form an optical fiber loop in Fig. 1, the loop is not shown After passing through the optical fiber loop 16, the clockwise light beam r is returned into the optical wave guide 2 and is then bent by the grating 7, to pass into the optical wave guide 3. The light beam r is further bent by the grating 8, to reach the photo diode 14.The counterclockwise light beam 1 which is provided by the grating 6 is applied through the optical wave guide 2 to the optical fiber loop 16. The counterclockwise light beam 1, after passing through the optical fiber loop 16 counterclockwise, reaches the end of the optical wave guide 5, and is then bent from the optical wave guide S.into the optical wave guide 4 by the grating 9, to reach the photo diode 14. The photo diode receives the clockwise beam r and the counterclockwise beam 1 simultaneously. One of the two light beams r and 1 has been subjected to amplitude modulation. When the fiber loop turns at an angular velocity fl, a phase difference AG is provided between the light beams r and 1. The output of the photo diode includes an electrical signal having an angular frequency equal to the modulation angular frequency xm. The amplitude of the signal includes the phase difference A3. Accordingly, the phase difference AG can be obtained by detecting the amplitude. This function will be described in more detail. When the clockwise beam and the counterclockwise beam come out of the optical wave guides 5 and 2, respectively, they can be represented by the .following expressions clockwise 1 a sin um t i L t counterclockwise e where X is the angular frequency of the laser beam, and xm is the modulation angular frequency of the modulator 11. It is assumed that, when the clockwise light beam and the counterclockwise light beam pass through the optical fiber loop respectively clockwise and counterclockwise, the former light beam leads by A0 2 in phase and the latter light beam lags by AG 2 in phase.As is clear from expression 1 , the phase difference Ae is proportional to the angular velocity Q of the fiber loop. Therefore, then the light beams r and 1 enter the photo diode, they can be represented by the following functional expressions clockwise Er 1 a sin m t ei t 2 counterclockwise Er ei wt 2 The photo diode performs square law detection. Therefore, the square of the sum of both input signals is the value of the electrical signal output by the photo diode.Thus, the output electrical signal I is I E12 Er 1 a sin um t 2 2 Er E1 cos AG 1 sin wm t 7 That is, the output electrical signal includes DC components, wm components and 2um components. The um components in the output electrical signal can be obtained by generating an electrical signal having an angular frequency wm as a reference signal, and applying the same to the output electrical signal I expression 7 to electrically perform synchronous detection. The amplitude of the um components is 2 2 Er a 2 E E a cos 8 Thus1 the phase difference AG can be detected. Either the clockwise or counterclockwise light beam can be amplitude modulated as in a second embodiment of the invention shown in Fig. 2. In this embodiment, a directional coupler type amplitude modulator 17 is employed. In the second embodiment, the optical wave guide 5 is divided into optical wave guide parts 5e and Sd Fig.3 , which are adjacent to each other at end portions where electrodes 18c and 18d are provided. When two optical wave guides are juxtaposed adjacent to each other on the order of the wavelength, they are coupled to each other through evanescent waves in the intermediate region of low refractive index therebetween. This is known as evanescent wave coupling .When the two optical wave guides are equal in optical phase constant, the coupling is maximum, and, ideally, all the energy in one optical wave guide is transferred to the other optical wave guide. The optical phase constant is proportional to the refractive index. The refractive index can be varied by controlling the electric field when the optical wave guide has an electro optic effect. A modulation signal generating IC 19 applies a modulation voltage to the electrode 18c and 18d. The amplitude of the light beam transmitted to the optical wave guide 5d from the optical wave guide Sc changes with the modulation angular frequency wm. That is, in this embodiment, the clockwise beam is subjected to amplitudemodulation. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, no grating is employed. The optical wave guides 2 and 3 are not perpendicular to each other at the intersection, but they are smoothly connected in such a manner that the directions of the center lines are made to coincide with each other.The optical wave guides 3 and 4, 4 and 5, and 5 and 2 are connected in the same manner. In the embodiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2, theS N ratio is increased by employing amplitude modulation. However, phase modulation may be employed. More specifically, a phase modulator 20 may be provided for one of the clockwise and counterclockwise light beams as shown inFig. 5. As the optical wave guide has an electro optic effect, the refractive index changes with the electric field. When a voltage is applied across electrodes 21 and 22, the refractive index of that part of the wave guide which is between the two electrodes is changed, to change the light velocity, whereby phase modulation can be achieved. The magnitude of phase modulation is b sin bm tThe counterclockwise beam and the clockwise beam can be expressed as follows counterclockwise beam e CL t at 2 clockwise beam ei t A0 2 b sin um t When square law detection is effected with a photo detector, then the output signal includes the following term J1 b sin AG sin um t where Jl b is the Bessel function, and m is the modulation frequency. Therefore, sin AG can be obtained by conducting electrical synchronous detection with a reference signal having the frequency um. In the above described embodiments, one of the clockwise beam or the counterclockwise beam is amplitudemodulated or phase modulated. An optical hererodyne method utilizing optical frequency shift may also be employed in the invention. Fig. 6 is an explanatory diagram outlining a surface acoustic wave transducer . utilizing an optical frequency shift method. An interdigital electrode 23 is provided beside an optical wave guide 5e. A drive circuit applies an AC voltage having a frequency um to the electrode 23. The substrate 1 should exhibit an acousto optic effect. When the AC voltage is applied to the interdigital electrode 23, a surface acoustic wave advancing in the direction of the broken line is generated. As the substrate 1 has an acousto optic effect, it has a region whose refractive index is changed by the surface acoustic wave. Thus, the surface acoustic wave and the light beam interact with each other. The light beam is modulated so that the conservation law of the light beam and surface acoustic wave with respect to wave number and frequency is established. The light beam in the wave guide Se advances to the wave guide 5f, which is inclined with respect to the wave guide 5e, and simultaneously the angular frequency is shifted to wm . When the frequency is shifted as described above, the light beam in the optical wave guide 5f can be expressed as follows ei m t After passing through the optical fiber loop, the two light beams are counterclockwise E1 ei t 2 clockwise Er ei m t 2. As the photo diode subjects the sum to square law detection, the output signal of the photo diode includes the folowing term E1 Er cos wm t AG This output is electrically compared with the reference signal cos wm t , to obtain the phase difference AG. This method is disadvantageous in that the signal processing system is rather intricate however, it is advantageous in that the operation is scarcely affected by level drift because the output of the photo detector is an AC signal having the frequency um . Furthermore, the method has merit in that its phase difference detection range is wide. Thus, according to the invention, an optical fiber gyro is fabricated monolithically by providing the optical wave guides, the laser diode, the photo diode and the modulator on a substrate having an electro optic effect.Therefore, the optical fiber gyro according to the invention has the following merits or effects 1 The device is small in size, small in weight and durable against vibration. In the device, adjustment of the optical axis is unnecessary, because the active elements, namely, the laser diode, the photo diode, the optical wave guides and the modulator are intergrated on one substrate. 2 The optical fiber gyro is high in S N ratio, because a modulator, such as an optical amplitude modulator, an optical phase modulator or a frequency shifter is inserted in the optical path of one of the clockwise and counterclockwise light beams. 3 The modulation signal generating circuit and the detection signal electrical processing circuit can be monolithically arranged by employing a semiconductor such as GaAs or InP to form a substrate having the electro optic effect. Fig. 8 shows an optical fiber gyro according to another embodiment of the invention. In this optical fiber gyro, the light branching element is a diffraction grating, and the substrate 61 is made of a material such as LiNbo3 which allows the passage of a laser beam and can form optical wave guides 62. The optical wave guides 62 are provided in the form of a cross on the substrate. In this embodiment,Ti is diffused in a substrate of LiNbo3, to form two straight parts in the substrate which are higher in refractive index than the substrate, thus providing the optical wave guides. A diffraction grating 63 is provided at the intersection of the two optical wave guides, in a manner such that it forms a 450 angle with each of the optical wave guides 62. The function of the diffraction grating 63 corresponds to that of the beam splitter in the abovedescribed conventional optical fiber gyro. The diffraction grating 3 is formed by the following method Photoresist, which is lower in refractive index than the substrate, is coated on the substrate, and is then subjected to two beam interference exposure, to form interference fringes arranged at certain intervals. The portions of the photo resist which have been subjected to the exposure, or those portions not subjected to the exposure are removed by developing, to form the diffraction grating, The two beam interference technique mentioned above is as follows A laser beam is divided into two beams, which are changed into parallel beams of larger diameter with the aid of collimator lens. The two light beams thus provided are applied to the photo sensitve material in a manner such as to form an incident angle e with respect to the normal, so that interference fringes are formed on the photo sensitive material. A light emitting element 64 and a light receiving element 65 are connected to ends of the crossed optical wave guides 62, 62, respectively. The light emitting element 65 may be a PIN photo diode or an avalanche photo diode. These elements are connected, in the form of a chip, to the ends of the optical wave guides 62. Similarly to the conventional optical fiber gyro, an optical fiber loop is fabricated by winding a single mode otical fiber several turns, the two ends of the optical fiber loop being connected to the remaining ends of the optical wave guides 62. Instead of the above described diffraction grating, a directional coupler type light branching element may be employed. Fig. 9 is a perspective view of an optical fiber gyro according to a further embodiment of the invention, which utilizes such a light branching element. As shown in Fig. 9, four optical wave guides 77, 78, 79 and 70 are provided on a substrate 1. Each waveguide is bent through 900 near the center of the substrate 1. None of the optical wave guides are crossed. However, pairs of optical wave guides are adjacent to each other, and a light beam is shifted from one of the optical waveguides to the other via evanescent waves. In this embodiment, the optical wave guide 77 is laid between the light emitting element 74 and the fiber end A. The clockwise CW light beam goes through a the optical wave guide 77 to the optical fiber loop 76. The optical wave guide 78 consists of a first part adjacent to the optical wave guide 77 and a second part extended to the fiber end B. Therefore, the counterclockwise CCW beam is transferred from the optical wave guide 77 to the optical wave guide 78 through evanescent waves, thus entering the optical fiber loop 76 through the fiber end B. The CW light beam, after passing through the optical fiber loop, enters the optical wave guide 78 through the fiber end B. The optical wave guide 78 is parallel with the optical wave guide 70 with a small gap therebetween. Therefore, the light beam is shifted from the optical wave guide 78 to the optical wave guide 70 through evanescent waves. The CQ light beam, after passing through the optical fiber loop, is shifted to the optical wave guides 77, 79 and 70, in the stated order, through evanescent waves. As is apparent from the above description, directional couplers are formed between the optical wave guides 77 and 78, 78 and 70, 79 and 70, and 79 and 77, respectively. These four directional couplers serve as light branching elements, thus corresponding to the beam splitter in the conventional optical fiber gyro. The light branching element may also be a Yshaped branching path. Fig. 10 is a perspective view of an optical fiber gyro according to a further embodiment of the invention, which employs such light branching elements. As shown in Fig. 10, optical wave guides 811, 812, 813, 814 extend from the light emitting element 84, fiber end A, light receiving element 85 and fiber end B perpendicularly to the end faces of the substrate, respec tively. Optical wave guides 815, 816,817 and 818 are formed on the substrate in a manner such that they connect the optical wave guides 811, 812, 813 and 814 as shown inFig. 10. These optical wave guides provide the aforementioned Y shaped branching paths 819, 820, 821 and 822. The Y shaped branching path 819 is provided at the joint of the optical wave guides 811, 815 and 818. The laser beam from the light emitting element 4 is divided into two light beams at the Y shaped branching path 819. One of the two light beams goes through the optical wave guides 815 and 812 to the fiber end A, while the other goes through the wave guides 818 and 814 to the fiber end B. The light beams, after passing through the optical fiber loop 86, return through the fiber endsB and A to the optical wave guides 814 and 812, respectively.Parts of the light beams, which have been allowed to pass through the optical wave guides 817 and 816 at theY shaped branching paths 22 and 20, respectively, enter the light receiving element 85. In the above described embodiment, the light emitting element and the light receiving element are not integrated in the substrate that is, the chips are bonded to the substrate. However, the light emitting element, the receiving element and the substrate may all.be made from one compound semiconductor crystal. That is, they can be provided in monolithic form. Fig. 11 is a perspective view of an optical fiber gyro according to a fourth embodiment of the invention, which uses a GaAs substrate. The substrate 91 comprises an electrode 923, an n GaAs layer 924, an n Ga Al As layer 925 and an 0.2 0.8 n GaAs layer 926, an optical waveguide, which are arranged in the stated order from bottom to top, A light emitting element 94 has the same layer structure as a light receiving element 95. The light emitting element 94 is a double heterostructurts junction laser which comprises an active layer, namely, an n GaAs layer 928, a p GaO 2Alo 8As layer 929, a p GaAs layer 930 and an electrode 931 which are arranged in the stated order from bottom to top.The laser beam is oscillated from the active n GaAs layer 928, and is transmitted to the optical wave guide by evanescent coupling. In the light receiving element 95, the n GaAs layer 928 is an absorption layer, and coupling with the optical wave guide is effected through evanescent waves. As the optical systems are optically integrated, the optical fiber gyro according to the invention is small in size, small in weight, high in reliability and high in stability. In the optical systems, the number of elements requiring optical axis adjustment is decreased, or it becomes completely unnecessary to adjust the optical axes thereof. Accordingly, the optical fiber gyro can be readily manufactured or assembled. Fig. 12 is a plan view showing another example of an optical fiber gyro according to this invention. Two parallel optical wave guides 102 are formed horizontally on a substrate 101 having an electro optic effect, and two parallel optical wave g .vides 102 are formed vertically on the substrate, so that t wave guides cross at four points. Four light branching element 103 are disposed at the intersections of the optical wave guides 102 that is, at the four corners of the square. The two groups of optical wave guides 102 are separated from each other.A phase shifter 106 is provided on one of the two groups of optical wave guides 102. The material of the substrate is, for instance, crystalline LiNbo3. The optical wave guides may be formed by a Ti diffusion method, for instance. More specifically, each optical wave guide is provided by forming a linear part on the substrate, which is higher in refractive index than the remaining portions. In this example, diffraction gratings are employed as light branching elements 103. The diffraction gratings may be provided by forming parallel grating lines by mechanical means. However, the diffraction gratings can be more readily formed by photolithography. A photoresist lower in refractive index than the optical wave guide is applied to the intersections of the optical wave guides, interference fringes of desired period are formed by two beam interference exposure, and the photoresist which is fl t hardened is then washed away.Thus, the diffraction gratings formed of photoresist may be employed as the light branching elements. The light emitting element 104 is a laser diode or a superluminescent diode in the form of a chip bonded to one end face of the substrate. It goes without saying that a container including the chip may be bonded to the end face of the substrate. In this connection, it is essential that the light emitting element be firmly bonded to the substrate. The optical fiber gyro further comprises a light receiving element 105 which is, for instance, an ordinary silicon photo diode. The element 105, which is in the form of a chip, or is put in a suitable container, is bonded to the end of the predetermined optical waveguide 102. The light receiving element may be a photodiode of a compound semiconductor such as GaA1As. The optical fiber gyro further comprises a phase shifter 106. The phase shifter includes a pair of electrodes 107 arranged on both sides of the separated optical wave guide 102 in a manner such that they are parallel with the optical wave guide, and a power source 108 for applying a DC voltage across the electrodes. The power source is provided outside the substrate 101 and is connected through suitable lead wires to the electoodes 107. The electrodes may, for example, be aluminum plates coated with insulating material. Upon the application of a DC voltage across the electrodes, a strong electric field is generated in the space between the electrodes. As the substrate has an electro optic effect, the refractive index changes in proportion to the intensity of the electric field. Each optical wave guide 102 is formedby a Ti diffusion method, so that it is larger in refractive index than other regions of the substrate, and confine light therein, as described before. As the refractive index is changed by the electric field, the velocity of the light passing through the optical wave guide is changed. Thus, the phase can be shifted as desired by controlling the applied voltage. The optical fiber loop 109 is fabricated by winding a single mode optical fiber several turns. The two ends of the optical fiber loop are connected to the end faces of the predetermined optical wave guides 102 on the substrate. Rod lenses may be employed so that the light beams in the optical wave guides are concentrated and then applied to the optical fiber loop 109. The substrate may be of any material which provides an electro optic effect. For instance, the material of the substrate may be a dielectric such as LiNbO3 or Bi12SiO20, or a c m ound semiconductor such as GaAs orInP. In the cast where the substrate is made of a compound semiconductor, all of the optical elements can be formed on one and the same substrate as described above that is, the optical elements can be provided in monolithic form. Fig. 13 shows another example of the optical fiber gyro according to the invention. In the example, the substrate is of n type GaAs. Similarly to the above described example, the light emitting element 104 is a GaAs laser diode, however, it should be noted that the element 104 is provided on an optical wave guide on the substrate. The substrate comprises an electrode 1010, a thick n GaAs layer 1011, an n GaO 2Alo 8As layer 1012 and an n GaAs optical wave guide layer 1013 which are laid one on another in the stated order. The light receiving element 105 is a GaAs photodiode, instead of a silicon photo diode. The Clad layer 102 1014 is an n Ga0.2 Al gAs layer. The light receiving element 105 on the clad layer 102 comprises an n GaAs layer absorbing layer 1015, a p GaO 2Alo 8As layer 1016, a p GaAs layer 1016 and an electrode. As the light receiving element corresponds in structure to the light emitting element, all of the optical system can be provided in monolithic form by photolithography. In the example shown in Figs. 12 and 13, the light branching elements 103 are diffraction gratings however, a Y shaped branching system 1020 as shown inFig. 14 may be employed. Furthermore, an evanescent coupling system 1021 as shown in Fig. 15 may be employed. When two optical wave guides 1022 and 1023 are adjacent to each other, an evanescent wave may be transmitted from one wave guide to the other, whereby the energy is transmitted.Thus, the branching element may be formed by employing an evanescent coupling system. As the optical systems are integrated on one substrate, the optical fiber gyro is small in size, small in weight, high in reliability and excellent in stability. It is completely or substantially unnecessary to adjust the optical axes of the optical systems. Accordingly, the optical fiber gyro of the invention can be manufactured and assembled with ease. The amount of phase shift can be continuously changed by controlling the applied voltage that is, it can be readily adjusted, Thus, the optical fiber gyro of the invention is high in sensitivity in a low angular speed range. The optical fiber gyro of the invention may be installed on automobiles, ships and airplanes, to measure rotational angular speeds or rotational displacements. Furthermore, the optical fiber gyro may be installed on a moving object such as a robot. In this case, it is used as a position sensor for detecting the position of the moving object.
