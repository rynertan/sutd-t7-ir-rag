# MAGNETIC SEPARATION

## Abstract
A magnetic separator includes a carrier sheet 21 over which material to be separated magnetically into two or more fractions passes and, behind the sheet, an arrange ment for moving successive pairs of parallel bar magnets along the sheet. The pairs are separated by gaps so that there are gaps between magnetic flux lobes to which the material to be separated is subjected.
