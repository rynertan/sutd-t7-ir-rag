# Cytocentrifuge.

## Abstract
A cytocentrifuge especially suitable for centrifugation of materials requiring handling under conditions of contain ment is characterised by a plurality of holders each adapted to retain an individual sample chamber in juxtaposition to a receiving surface with interposed filter seal and removable as a unit from the rotating carrier of the machine. The holder is preferably adapted to be supported tiltingly by the carrier so as only under centrifugal force to permit a sample to contact the receiving surface and while this is perpendicular to the centrifugal load on the sample. The carrier is preferably an apertured plate removable from a drive hub for cleansing and sterilization, and the drive hub forms part of a sealable head assembly of containment bowl and removable cover, the head assembly being removable as a unit for loading unloading under containment conditions.
