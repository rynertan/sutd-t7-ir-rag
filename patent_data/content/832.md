# Melt processable resorcinol phthalate polyesters and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
A melt processable resorcinol phthalate polyester having a terephthalic acid content not greater than about 30 mole percent is prepared by a two stage process utilizing an alkali or alkaline earth metal acetate catalyst. The first stage yields a non volatile pre polymer which is then melt polymerized to the resorcinol phthalate polyester. A process for preparing a melt processable resorcinol phthalate polyester from resorcinol by reacting it with an acetylating agent is also disclosed. The resulting polyester exhibits high char and low flammability in addition to being melt processable.
