## Description
The present invention relates in general to the synthesis of cumene by the catalyzed reaction of benzene with propylene, and more particularly, the synthesis of cumene with the formation of minimal amounts of n propylbenzene impurity. The synthesis process involves the reaction of benzene and propylene in the liquid phase in contact with a zeolite omega catalyst. Isopropylbenzene or cumene, as it is commonly known, is currently produced in large volume principally as an intermediate in the production of phenol and acetone which are obtained by the acid catalyzed reaction of cumene with air. n Propylbenzene impurity, which cannot be effectively removed from the cumene, produces propionaldehyde and can become further oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid. This leads to autocatalyzed acid activated side reactions that decrease the yield of the desired phenol and acetone. These organic acids are also corrosive toward the processing apparatus. At impurity levels of the order of a few hundred parts per million, the autocatalytic and corrosion problems are not especially serious, but the formation of even the proportionally small amount of propionaldehyde in the acetone product is distinctly disadvantageous when this acetone product is used in the synthesis of organic resins such as polyepoxides. This is mainly because the aldehyde impurity carries through as an undesirable colorant. Currently the most widely used commercial scale cumene synthesis route. is the catalytic condensafiof prcess using phosphoric acid on Kieselguhr as the heterogeneOus catalyst. It is a liquid phase fixed bed process carrier out at temperatures within the range of about 450 to 50OÃ‰ , at a pressure of about 500 600 psig and using a benzene to propylene molar ratio of from 6 to 8. Although generally effective in producing a cumene product containing low amounts of n propylbenzene, this advantage exacts a high price in equipment corrosion, and catalyst handling problems. The catalyst is itself highly corrosive and necessitates the use of expensive materials of construction for the reactor.Precisely controlled amounts of water must be added to the feed to prevent the irreversible conversion of orthophosphoric acid to the meta form with consequent rapid catalyst deactivation. The catalyst also has very low transalkylation activity resulting in a high concentration in the product of poly substituted alkylaromatics. Additionally, upon deactitation, the non regenerable catalyst undergoes significant agglomeration cuasing a tedious and time consuming changeout procedure. A less commonly used commercial alternative route to cumene synthesis uses homogeneous aluminum chloride hydrochloric acid slurry catalyst. This process has problems of spent catalyst sludge disposal, the need for corrosion resistant materials of construction for process apparatus and complex catalyst alkylate product separation equipment as well as poor single pass cumene selectivity. Because of the considerable success achieved in other hydrocarbon conversion processes using crystalline zeolite based catalyst compositions, considerable effort has been expended by many in the field to develop a zeolite catalyst for use in cumene synthesis. Although in general, large pore molecular sieve zeolites have been found to catalyze both the direct alkylation of benzene with propylene and the transalkylation of diisopropylbenzene with benzene to form cumene, all of the prior proposed processes produce unacceptably high amounts of n propylbenzene impurity at temperatures high enough to avoid rapid catalyst deactivation, or unacceptably rapid deactivation at temperatures low enough to avoid undue n propylbenzene formation. Accordingly, it is the principal object of the present invention to provide a cumene synthesis process using a zeolite based catalyst in which both the cumene yield is high and the catalyst deactivation rate and the formation of n propylbenzene are suitably low. This object and others which will be apparent from the specification are accomplished by the process which comprises contacting in the liquid phase benzene and propylene in a molar ratio of at least 3.5 1 at a temperature of from 2000F. to 400 F. with zeolite omega, said zeolite omega having a M20 A1203 molar ratio of less than 0.20, preferably less than 0.05, wherein IV rI represents alkali metal cations, and recovering the cumene reaction product thereby formed. It is surprisingly found that zeolite omega is unique among crystalline zeolites of the molecular s esFm type in catalyzing the alkylation of benzene with propyleneAs a general class, the zeolite catalysts facilitate the formation of much larger proportions of n propylbenzene then the aforementioned P2O5 Kieselguhr or AlCl3 HCl catalysts under the same reaction conditions. Also the formation rate of n propylbenzene over zeolite based catalysts increases exponentially with increasing temperature. Accordingly, to retain the n propylbenzene impurity in the cumene product at the commercial specification of below 200 ppm, the reaction temperature must be about 400 F. or less. With the exception of zeolite omega, the zeolite catalysts deactivate so rapidly under these temperature conditions that commercial operation is found to be altogether unfeasible.Zeolite omega, however, is found to have a remarkably high catalyst productivity before regeneration is required, a high reaction selectivity for cumene, an extremely low, essentially nil, selectivity for triisopropylbenzene, and to produce a cumene product containing less than about 200 ppm n propylbenzene. Moreover, this level of performance is obtained without the costly feed pretreatment, complex refining train, expensive non corrosive materials for reactor construction, and non regenerable catalyst disposal problems that afflict the prior proposed in processes. Zeolite omega is described in detail and the method for its preparation disclosed in pending application Serial No. 625,091, filed October 23, 1975, and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The composition of zeolite omega can be expressed stoichiometrically in terms of moles of oxides as follows 1.0 0.5 A20 Al203 5 20 SiO2 n wherein A represents at least one cation having a valence n , preferably 8 valence of 1 to 3 inclusive. The cations represented by A include non metallic cations such as hydrogen, ammonium, and organic cations of the alkylonium type, particularly alkylammonium cations of the structure R 4 q Hq N wherein q has a value of from 0 to 3 inclusive and R is an alkyl group, preferably methyl or.ethyl, and also A can represent metal cations such as alkali metals, particularly sodium, alkaline earth metals, transition metals and rare earth elements of the lanthanide series. The transition metals are those having atomic numbers from 21 through 29, from 39 through 46 and from 72 through 78. The lanthanide or rare earth series comprises elements having atomic numbers from 57 through 71. In addition to its chemical composition and in conjunction therewith, zeolite omega can be identified and distinguished from other crystalline substances by its X ray powder diffraction pattern, the data for which are set forth below in Table A. In obtaining the X ray powder diffraction pattern, standard techniques were employed. The radiation was the ROcdoublet of copper, and a Eiger counter spectrometer with a strip chart pen recorder was used. The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of 2, where e is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart.From these, the relative intensities, and d A observed, the interplanar spacing in Angstrom units corresponding to the recorded lines, were determined. In Table A, the more significant interplanar spacings, i.e., the d A values which characterize and distinguish zeolite omega from other zeolite species and which must be present in the X ray powder diffraction pattern of zeolite omega are set forth.The relative intensities of the lines are expressed as VS very strong , S strong , NS medium strong and M medium .

Representative reactants are silica gel, silicic acid, colloidal silica, alkali metal silicate, and reactive amorphous solid silicas as the source of silicon, and activated alumina, gamma alumina, alumina trihydrate or alkali metal aluminate as the source of aluminum. Sodium hydroxide and tetramethylammonium hydroxide or halide are typical convenient sources of sodium and tetramethylammonium ions, respectively. The reaction system is formed by placing all the required reactants in the proportions hereinbefore defined in a reaction vessel and bringing the temperature of the system thus formed to a temperature of between 80 and 100 C. for l to 8 days. An alternative synthesis method is disclosed inU. S. P. 3,923,639, issued to J. Ciric, December 2, 1975. In that disclosure zeolite omega is denominated zeolite ZSM 4. For use as a catalyst in the present invention the alkali metal cation content of the as synthesized form of the zeolite is reduced to below 40 equivalent percent, and preferably below 5 equivalent percent, by conventional ion exchange techniques using aqueous acids when the alkali metal is to be replaced with hydrogen ions or aqueous solutions of salts of ammonia or petals other than alkali metals.The preferred form of the zeolite is the acid form in which not more than 10 percent of the Also4 tetrahedra are as so ciated with metal cations and the remaining A104 tetrahedra are associated with hydrogen cations or are not associated with any cation, i.e. are decationized. Acid sites can also be created by ion exchange with bivalent or multivalent metal cations. For steric reasons the tetramethylammonium cations present in the as synthesized zeolite omega cannot be ion exchanged, but these cations can be removed by thermal conversion to ammonium cations and then replaced by ion exchange in the known manner.Decationization of these cation sites can be prevented during the thermal treatment by using a calcination environment comprising ammonia and nitrogen as disclosed in U.S.P.3,853,743, issued December 10, 1974, to A. B. Schwartz. The SiO2 Al203 molar ratio of the zeolite omega catalyst is not critical and can coincide with the range of the as synthesized zeolite, i.e. 5 to 20, provided only that below 6.4 the zeolite contains sufficient metal cations to stabilize the structure against collapse if and when the zeolite is calcined at temperatures above 500 C. prior to use. The final catalyst zeolite form should have a degree of crystallinity sufficient to exhibit an adsorption capacity for oxygen at 183 C. and 100 mm.Hg of oxygen pressure of 12 weight percent based on the anhydrous weight of the zeolite. SiO2 Al2O3 molar ratios in the range of 6.4 to 10 are much preferred. A preferred process for preparing zeolite omega having a molar SiO2 Al2O3 ratio of greater than 6.4 is crystallization from a gel having the following proportions Na2O A1203 3.00 CH3 4Ni20 A1203 0.60 SiO2 Al2O3 10.0 R20 A1203 144.The gel is maintained at 95 C. for 90 100 hours. The zeolite product is then isolated by filtration, washed with water until the filtrate pH is less than about 10, nd dried in air. Thermal removal of the tetramethylammonium cations is accomplished by the following heat treatment in a well ventilated oven Temperature Rate or Time Ambient to 3500C. 10 C. min. 350 C. Hold for two hours 350 C. to 5500C. 100C. min. 550 C. Hold for two hours Ammonium exchange of the calcined zeolite is conducted with three one hour batch wise reflux treatments using 10 percent NH4Cl solution followed by thorough water washing.Completion of the catalyst consists of preparing a mull compound of 80 percent by weight zeolite and 20 percent acid peptized alumina, extruding through a 1 16 inch die, drying the extrudate at ll06C. and activating at 550 C., preferably using the heating schedule used to remove the tetramethylammonium cations, supra. The catalyst composition can consist of zeolite omega alone or in conjunction with diluents or binders which do not exhibit any adverse activity under the alkylation conditions involved. Gamma alumina serves particularly well as a binder diluent in forming the extruded catalyst forms. Kaolinitic clays and inorganic oxides generally are also suitable. Additives may be used to render the binder or any amorphous phase formed upon activation of the omega catalyst inactive to the reactants. These may include P205 or other phosphorus compounds, both inorganic and organic. The process can employ a fixed catalyst bed, a moving bed or a fluidized bed in the same manner as zeolite based catalysts are employed in other well known hydrocarbon conversion processes. The two most critical factors in the present alkylation process are the alkylation temperature and the molar proportions of benzene and propylene in the feed composition. Catalyst productivity in terms of pounds of cumene per pound of catalyst, raw material efficiency with respect to both benzene and propylene and product purity are all directly affected by the benzene propylene molar ratio of the feed. Catalyst life and product purity with respect to n propylbenzene are similarly affected by the alkylation temperature. The production of undesirable n propylbenzene has been found to be remarkably sensitive to the alkylation temperature employed. As is evident from the data set forth in Example 4, a peak temperature rise of only 25 F. from 3950 F. to 4200 F. using a benzene propylene feed molar ratio of 7 1 and a benzene LHSV of 7.1 hr. results in an increase of n propylbenzene formation from 100 ppm to 500 ppm in the cumene product. Accordingly, the alkylation temperature should be maintained below 4000 ., and preferably at or below 395cm. Although n propylbenzene formation generally decreases with decreasing alkylation temperature, the rate of deactivation of the catalyst is found to increase with decreasing temperature.For this reason alkylation temperatures above about 200 F., and preferably above about 300if. are employed. It will be understood that in adiabatic reaction systems, such as fixed bed reactors, the alkylation occurs over a range of temperatures resulting primarily from the exothermic nature of the primary alkylation reaction.The maximum temperature obtained in the bed can be controlled to a considerable degree by controlling the temperature of the feed mixture entering the bed, i.e. lowering the temperature of the feed mixture decreases the peak temperature by providing a heat sink for the evolved heat of reaction. Thus, in the present process it is possible to carry out the alkylation reaction in such a manner that the bulk of the reaction takes place below 4000F. or even 3950 F. while permitting some of the reaction to take place at 400 F. or higher. In such a process the formation of relatively large proportions of n propylbenzene which occurs above 4000 . is balanced by the formation of very small amounts of this impurity at the lower temperatures.The resulting total cumene product of the reactions at all the various temperatures will, therefore, be commercially acceptable from the standpoint of purity. This type of process is considered to be within the scope of the present invention, but it is preferred to avoid even a peak temperature of 4000 . or higher. The benzene propylene feed molar ratio is most preferably at least 7 in order to take advantage of the very favorable catalyst productivity obtained at those levels. Even at a ratio of about 6, however, catalyst productivity is comparable or even superior to that of the present commercial catalysts. At ratios below about 5.0 both the benzene and propylene raw material efficiencies become unacceptably low for commercial operation. Consequently, the minimum benzene propylene feed molar ratio should be at least 5.0, is advantageously at least 6, and is most preferably at least 7. Pressure is not a critical process condition provided it is sufficiently high to maintain the reaction mixture in the liquid phase at the process temperatures involved. Similarly the benzene volume liquid hourly space velocity tHSV is not narrowly critical but is advanta geously at least 2 hr. Ãš, and preferably at least 5 hr. The process of the present invention is illus trated in the following examples Example 1 Preparation of Zeolite Omega Catalyst A In a solution of 160 g. 4.0 moles NaOH in 300 ml. water was dissolved 156 g. 2.0 moles A1 OH 3. A solution of 89.9 g. 0.41 moles tetramethylammonium chloride in 2580 ml. water was prepared. A 701.3 g. 10.5 moles portion of hydrated amorphous silica was blended into this solution, after which the sodium aluminate solution was added slowly, and the resulting mixture stirred rapidly for several minutes. The viscous gel was sealed into a glass jar lined with polytetrafluorethylene and heated for 17 days at 950C., during which time the crystalline zeolite settled to the bottom of the jar. The zeolite was collected on aBuchner funnel, and was washed repeatedly with water until the filtrate pH was less than 10. The washed product was dried at 1100C., and was then spread in a thin layer in an evaporating dish.The zeolite was placed into an air purged oven, and was heated at 220 C. for 2 hours and at 5250C. for 4 hours to decompose the entrained organic material. The chemical composition of the calcined product was Na2O ................ 2.8 wt anhyd. basis A1203 17.2 wt SiO2 ................ 80.0 wt anhyd. basis B The calcined zeolite of part A supra was subjected to 5 sequential one hour batch wise reflux ion exchange treatments using 10 ml. 10 percent NH4Cl per gram of zeolite per exchange. The product was washed until the filtrate was chloride free, after which it was dried at 110 C.The composition of the ammonium exchanged zeolite was as follows Na2O ............... 0.02 wt anhyd. basis NH4 20 .. 7.2 wt Al2O3 .............. 16.0 wt SiO2 ............... 75.4 wt The dried ammonium exchanged zeolite was mixed thoroughly with acid peptized boehmite alumina in order to produce a paste containing 80 wt zeolite and 20 wt alumina, both defined on an anhydrous basis. The paste was extruded to give 1 16 inch diameter pellets which were then dried at 110 C. The dried extrudate was converted to the acidic zeolite catalyst by spreading it in a thin layer in an air purged oven and heating it for 2 hours at 220 C. and then 2 hours at 5500C. The product had a surface area of 320 m21g Nitrogen adsorption at 1960C. and p pO 0.03 . In testing the alkylation activity of the catalyst compositions of the present invention, a test unit having a 40 SO gal. day feed capacity was employed to permit catalyst evaluation at commercially realistic olefin mass velocities.This unit consisted of a 1.34 in. O. D. x 0.925 in. I.D. x 85 in. long stainless steel fixed bed reactor mounted in a three zone furnace having independent zone temperature control. The reactor was equipped with a 0.25 tn. Q. D.axial thermowell housing a 90 in. moveable thermocouple which was used to precisely monitor the catalyst bed temperature profile and thus quantitatively track the deactivation front. A separate 1.25 in. O. D. x 1.00 in.I. D. x 30 in. long stainless steel tube filled with 6 x 10 mesh quartz chips and mounted in a one zone furnace served as a feed preheater. A propylene feed cylinder, a 55 gallon stainless steel benzene feed drum and a 55 gallon stainless steel alkylate product drum were mounted on scale platforms accurate to 0.1 lb. This allowed for precise feed rate monitoring and the calculation of run material balances and catalyst raw material efficiencies.The material balances on test runs proved to be excellent at 99.5 0.5 percent. From the preheater the reactants entered the main reactor in an upflow mode. The reactor was typically loaded with 180 cc. of 6 x 10 mesh quartz chips bed length 17 in. which served as a supplemental preheat section, 630 cc. of undiluted catalyst charge bed length 60 in. followed by 85 cc. of 6 x 10 mesh quartz chips bed length 8 in. . After loading the reactor the following start up procedure was employed. The reactor was purged with 5 sCF hr. of nitrogen for one hour at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. The catalyst bed was then heated to 4000F. and the nitrogen purge maintained for approximately 16 hours. The nitrogen purge was then stopped and the reactor was then brought to test pressure and prescribed inlet temperature under the prescribed benzene flow. After approximately one hour the propylene flow to the reactor was started and precise test conditions were established. Because of the highly exothermic nature of the alkylation reaction and the quasi adibatic nature of the reaction system, a sharp reaction front A T of about 80 100 F. was set up in the catalyst bed. Catalyst deactivation occurred in a frontal rather than a homogeneous mode.Thus, periodic measurement of the reaction front position allowed for quantitative determination of catalyst deactivation rate expressed in in. hr. This is readily translated into a measure of catalyst productivity expressed in lb. cumene lb. catalyst. In addition to catalyst productivity, the test unit provided quantitative measurement of catalyst activity, selectivity and regenerability at commercially realistic process conditions. Example 2 Using the test unit and procedure as described above, a comparison of the catalyst life of the zeolite omega prepared in Example 1, supra, with the lives of three prior proposed zeolite based catalysts and a P205 Kieselguhr catalyst composition typical of those widely used commercially. The zeolite based catalysts which were compared with zeolite omega were a A steam stabilized zeolite Y U.S.P.3,130,007 prepared by ammonium ion exchanging a sodium zeolite Y having a Si Al molar ratio of 2.5 to reduce the Na20 content to 2.2 wt and calcining same at a temperature of 600 C. for 1.25 hours in a flowing stream of steam at 14.7 psia. Ammonia produced by the thermal decomposition of the ammonium cations was continually removed from the proximity of the zeolite during calcination, the zeolite was quickly cooled in air to below 3500 C. and then allowed to cool further to ambient room temperature. The product zeolite had an ion exchange capacity of about 32 percent and a high degree of crystallinity as evidenced by an adsorption capacity for oxygen 183 C. at 100 mm. oxygen pressure of about 28 wt 7.. b A hydrogen form of mordenite having a SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of 31, less than 0.02 wt Z Na20. Composition contained 20 wt alumina binder. c A decationized form of zeolite L U.S.P. 3,216,789 prepared by ammonium ion exchanging an as synthesized form of zeolite L having the empirical chemical omposition anhyd .04 Na20 0.92 K20 A1203 6.1 SiO2 to lower che Na20 content to .02 wt a and the K20 content to 3.8 wt and thereafter calcining the alumina bondtd ion exchanged product in air at 500 C. for 2 hours. The pressure in the reactor was maintained at 600 psig, the benzene propylene feed mole ratio was 7 1, the benzene LHSV was 7.1 hr. 1, the propylene mass velocity was 150 lb. hr. ft.Ãª, and the catalyst charge was 630 cc.The catalyst life was considered to be co extensive with the period the alkylation front remained in the reactor before breakthrough.

Zeolite L 290 370 180 Calculated from commercial operating data. It is readily observed from the results obtained that the catalyst life of the zeolite omega charge was constant over the entire peak temperature range of 490 F. to 370 F. whereas the conventional zeolite catalysts, as represented by the steam stabilized zeolite Y composition, rapidly deactivated with decreasing temperature. Also, over the peak temperature range of 370 F, to 4700F. the omega catalyst was vastly superior to all other catalysts with respect to catalyst life. Exatirole 3 Using the same test unit and procedure as inExample 2, the performance of zeolite omega in catalyzing the alkylation of benzene with propylene to fors cumene was evaluated with respect to productivity, selectivity, raw material efficiency and product purity at various benzene propylene feed molar ratios. The reactions were run at a pressure of 600 psig, a peak temperature of 3800F., a propylene mass velocity of 50 lb.thr. ft.2, benzene propylene molar ratios of 7 1, 5 1, 3.5 1 and 2 1 and l benzene t of 2.4 hr. .The results are set forth in Table II on the following page TABLE II EMI20.1 C6 C3 SEP MOLAR SEP RATIO SEP 7 SEP 5 SEP 3,5 SEP 2 tb PRODUCTIVITY tb 1b.

In fact, this transalkylation reaction occurs during the alkylation process between feed benzene and polyalklyated benzenes produced in situ in the reactor. In the transalkylation reaction the mount of n propylbenzene produced is found to be quite small when utilizing the present catalyst compositions.
