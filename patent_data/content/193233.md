# Information board and snap in plate used thereby.

## Abstract
The information board comprises a supporting board 1 provided with grooves 4 between which clip strips 5 are formed, which clip strips have a groove 6 in their lateral sides. Small snap in plates 2 comprise a rectangular body 10 and two backwards projecting legs 11 having on the sides thereof facing each other two bosses 13 . A projection 14 is mounted, between the legs 11 , on the body 10 . When a snap in plate 2 is clipped over one or more clip strips 5 said projection abuts against the clip strip 5 . The bosses 13 enter in grooves 16 in the lateral sides of the clip strips. By pushing on an edge of the body 10 a leg 11 can slide more deeply over the clip strip 5 so that the snap in plate tilts and snaps off.
