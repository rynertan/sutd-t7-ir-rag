# GAS LASERS

## Abstract
A gas laser includes a laser cavity 21 and electrodes 5, 6 defining an electric discharge path in the cavity. The electrodes include an anode 5 having a porous surface and gas is injected into the cavity 21 through the porous surface of the anode. Further gas inlets 22 are provided adjacent the anodes 5 . The laser head can be mechanically separated from gas flow generation means for generating a gas flow through the laser cavity.
