# PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CARBOXYLIC ACID ESTERS AND OR CARBOXYLIC ACIDS

## Abstract
Carboxylic acid ester functionalised derivatives of polymeric compounds containing residual carbon carbon double bonds, for example polyisobutylenes and ethylene based copolymers and terpolymers, are produced by reacting the polymeric compound with carbon monoxide and an alcohol in the presence of a protonic acid and as catalyst a at least one of the metals palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and cobalt in elemental or compound form and b a copper compound. In a modification of the invention carboxylic acid derivatives are produced by replac ing the alcohol reactant with less than 8 mole equivalents, based on the polymeric compound, of water.
