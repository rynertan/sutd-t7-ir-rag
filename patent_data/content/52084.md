## Description
Description of the invention entitled IMPROVEMENTS TO FLYING SHEARS AND FLYING SHEARS THUS IMPROVED This invention concerns improvements to flying shears and flying shears thus improved. In particular, the improvements according to this invention are applied to flying shears employed to obtain bil lets or bars of a pre set lenpth by means of truncation. To be more specific, said improvements are adopted so as to bring about a transmission of motion and a braking of rotating parts by means of especially effective and very silent systems. The improvements of this invention also enable the she aring blades to be re positioned in on optimal position before each processing operation. Improved flying shears are known which employ braking. systems and clutch means of a pneumatic type. It is known that said systems and means work too noisily and are therefore physically damaging for the persons operating the fly ing shears or present in the surroundings thereof. Noreover, the known flying shears do not make it poss ible to bring the shearing blades back to the desired posit ion at the end of each cycle of shearing the billets or bars, Because of this, said billets or bars may not always be of the desired length. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that the shearing or truncating systems employed in flying shears need a strong cooling action owing to their particular method of working. In this respect, cooling means for flying shears are envisaged in the known art which require a highly complex embodiment and considerable costs. In particular, flying shears are produced of which the braking means and means for transmitting motion are located in decentralized positions. Although such shears are effective for shearing the billets or bars, they are bulky and need very complex cool inp systems owing to said decentralization of their compo nent parts. One purpose of this invention, therefore, is to embody improvements that enable the shortcomings and drawbacks comprised in the known art in the field of flying shears to be.avoided. Said improvements comprise braking means and means to transmit motion which are very silent and especially effect ive by virtue of the particular actuation system employed. Moreover, the improvements of our invention comprise systems for the automatic re positioning of the blades after each shearing. In effect said operation is required since it may happen that the blades stop after each shearing in a position other than that pre set, owing to the interaction between the in . ertia of the rotating bodies of the machine and the braking. action. If such a position were not corrected, the shearinp of the next bar would be done at a weong or, at any rate, at an undesired distance. Another advantage of this invention lies in the fact that the fluid of the actuator system is the same as that used for lubricating and cooling the mechanisms such as, for instance, shafts, gear wheels, etc. which undergo stress. A fur the advantage of this invention is the fact that the improvements adopted in it enable flying shears to be embodied with a compact structure that requires neither ertro supports and protection nor complicated cooling cir s such as would take up greater space. The invention is therefore displayed in improvements to flying shears, whereby the flying shears consist of blade holding rotating means which are drawn into movement by an electromechanical actuator system and which cooperate with cuide means in shearing to a desired length billets bars g o ker lengthwise structures of any desired form during ovement thereof, with a pre set frequency of operation, said improvements being characterized by comprising oleodynamic means for transmitting motion, and braking means which cooperate with means that re posit ion the blades. The invention is also displayed in flying shears where the fluing shears consist of blade holding rotating means wtich are drawn into movement by an electromechanical act vete system and which cooperate with guide means in shear ing tillets, bas or lengthwise structures of any desired form during movement thereof, with a pre set frequencu of oberation, said flying shears being characterized by compris ing at least one of the following means oleodpnemic means for transmitting motion and braking means which cooperate with means that re positio the blades We shall give hereinafter, as a non restrictive example, the description of a preferential embodiment of the invention and shall refer to the tables wherein Fig.I shows the outer structure of improved shears Fig.2 shows a section of a detail along the line A A of the improved shears of Fig.1. In the figures the same parts or parts able to perform the same functions bear the same reference numbers. Fig.1 shows flying shears made according to a preferent ial embodiment of the invention. Said flying shears comprise a supporting protective structure 10 able to hold the mechanical and electromechanical parts of said shears. A drive group II is also included and consists of an electromechanical actuator system 12 able to draw into movement the wheelwork of a group that inverts motion 13. Transmission of motion from the electric motor 12 to the group which inverts motion 13 is carried out by two pull eys 14 15 connected together with a belt 16. In particular, the pulley 14 is keyed to the shaft of the electric motor 12, whereas the pulley 15 cooperates with the wheelwork of the group which inverts motion 13. The inverter group 13 in its turn transmits motion to two flywheels 17 117 through suitable helt means I8 II8 respectively. To obtain the right tensioning of said belt means 18118. suitable balance means 19 are employed which enable the motor 12 and the group which inverts motion 13 to be po sitioned suitably. Blade holding means 21 121 mounted on the shafts 20 120 are also included, and said shafts 20 120 cooperate coarially with the flywheels 17 117, as shown in Fip.2. In the example shown said blade holding means 21 121 ore conformed like an eccentric so as to he able to provide optimal service and, at the same time, to form a nepligible inertial system. Furthermore, said means 21 121 have to rotate in oppos ite directions so as to he able to shear the bars and billets. The aforesaid group which inverts motion 13 is employed to obtain said opposite directions of rotation. Fig.I also shows guide means 22 shaped channel wise and able to transport the bars or billets continuously, firstly into the shearing zone and thereafter into the discharge zo ne of the flying shears. Fig.2 shows a view of a section along the line A A of .a detail of Fig.1 wherein the improvements of the invention are included. When the shearing operation is required, the flywheels 17 117 are set in motion beforehand and are made to work at the best operating speed. Until the shearing has been carried out, said flywheels 17 117 rotate freely around their respective shafts 20 120. Furthermore, during said working phase the shafts them selves 20 120 can be kept clamped or can be made to rotate in the desired direction and at the desired speed by being acted upon with suitable braking means 23, which cooperate with means 24 that re position the blades 23. According to a preferential embodiment of this invent ion said braking means 23 comprise brakes 25 able, through a system of suitably conformed gear wheels 27 127 227, to wake the shafts 20 120 and a worn screw 26 cooperate together. Said cooperation can also be brought about with the help of other connecting means such as, for instance, pulleys, belts, transmissions, wedges or other means. Thus it is possible for the shafts 20 120 to be rotated in the desired direction and at the desired speed by acting. on the worm screw 26 so as to be able to position the bladeholding means 21 121 as desired before the shearing operation. then the position of the blade holders 21 121 has been regulated, the shafts 20 120 remain clamped by the worm screw 26, which, owing to its irreversibility, behaves like a substantially rigid structure in respect of said shafts 20 120. So as to carry out the actual shearing operation itself, steps are taken to connect the flywheels 17 117 to the shafts 20 120, on which they were initially mounted in such a way .as to be able to turn freely. This connection is made by causing the entry of fluid under pressure into a chamber 28 where there are present the clutch elements 29 forming part of the oleodynamic means 30 transmitting motion, and the aforesaid brakes 25. In particular, said fluid under pressure is injected C by known injection means, which have not been shown inFig.2, into a delivery duct 31 machined partially within the shafts20 I20 and opening out into the expansion chamber 28, The fluid under pressure causes the brakes 25 to be un clamped and the clutch elements 29 to be engaged. In this way the shafts 20 120 are disconnected from the braking means 23 and means 24 re positioning the blades.33 and are connected instead to rotating drums 32 132 which.are solidly fixed to the flywheels I7 II7. In effect, when shearing is carried out. the flywheels I7 II7 are connected to the shafts 20 120 in the way descri.bed so as to set in rotation the blade holders 21 121 in which the respective blades 33 133 are fitted. After having carried out a rotation not greater than 360 , said blade holders 21 121 enable the bar or biliet passing throuph the guide means 22 to be sheared. In particular, the shearing operation is ensured by the fact that the two blade holders 21 121 have the same speed of rotation and the shearing blades 33 133 occupy at all times counterpart positions in respect of the bar or billet to be sheared. The fact that the blades 33 133 occupy momentary count erpart positions is ensured owing to the use of a system of toothed wheels or gears 34 134 which connect the two shafts 20 120 together. In this way, when said blades 33 133 pass along inside the guide means 22, they come into contact with the moving bars and shear them. In particular, the length of the sheared billets or bars is determined, provided that the speed of rotation of the flywheels 17 117 remains unchanged, by the position of the blades 33 133 before the shearing. It is also possible for the bars to be sheared at diff ering distances by varying the speed of the flywheels 17 117 in a pre set manner and by keeping unvaried the position of the blades 33 133 at the start of shearing. The braking of the blade holders 21 121 or of the shafts 20 120 begins before the shearing is done. This operation is carried out when a suitable trans ducer converter 35 causes the discharge of pressure of the oleodynamic fluid through the ducts 31 after having read the momentary position of the start of braking of the blade holders 21 121. The brakes 25 reconnect at once, throuph the system of sear wheels 27 127 227, the shafts 20 120 to the worm crem 26, which by virtue of its own irreversibility causes the braking of the blade holders 21 121. Owing to the effect of the discharge of pressure of the fluid the clutch elements 29 are disengaged at the same time so as to enable the flywheels 17 II7 to go on rotating freely around the shafts 20 120. It may happen that the halted position of the blades 33 133 is different from the pre set position owing to the interaction between the inertia of the rotating bodies of the machine and the braking action. In such a case the means 24 which re position the blades 33 take action Said re positioning means 24 comprise the transducerconverter 35, which is also able to decode references present on an element able to move in correlation with the bladeholders 21 121 or blades 33. Said element may be one of the blade holders 21 121 or a pear wheel 34 or 134 or a rotating element fitted to one of the shafts 20 or 120 or else rotating or cooperating therewith 20 120. In the example shown in Fig.2 said references are arranged on the gear wheel 134 and may consist, for instance, of suitably coded sectors of circumference. The transducer converter 35 reads the position of the blades at the start of shearing and compares it with the pa sition reached by said blades at the end of shearing. The algebraic difference between the two positions is decoded by the transducer converter 35 and is converted thereby into a suitable signal, for instance, of an analogue or dipital type able to govern resnectively a geared motor or a step motor fitted to the shaft of the worm screw 26. When a new series of shearing with a different dimens.ion is required, it is necessary to proceed to position the.blades 33 133 anew. So as to carry out this operation, suitable controlling signals are sent to the transducer converter 35 through an appropriate keyboard or console. Said transducer converter 35 in its turn commands the geared motor or step motor fitted to the shaft of the worm .screw 26, in such a way as to actuate the positioning of th.e blades 33 133. Said positioning can also be carried out by acting by hand on the blade holders 21 121 or on means connected there to, but not before having taken steps to brake the shafts .20 120 with the braking means 23. The lubrication and cooling of the oleodynamic means transmitting motion 30 and of the braking means 23 are done advantapeously by using the same fluid as that in the oleo dynamic system. Said fluid is introduced into an auxiliary duct 36 ma . chined partially in the shafts 20 120 separately from the aforesaid delivery duct 31 and is made to flow over the gear wheels of the oleodynamic means 30 transmitting motien. The fluid runs over the wheels 27 127 227 and over the worm screw 26 and in this way lubricates and cools them. Lastly, the fluid is gathered suitably at the base of the braking means 23 and of the means 30 transmitting motion and is then re cycled and re injected into the ducts 31 36. We have described here a practical application of the improvements of the invention, but variants are possible. Thus the proportions and sizes can be varied and the blades..33 133 can be positioned with manual means which cooperate directly with the worm screw 26. These and other variants are possible for a technician in this field without depart .ing thereby from the scope of the idea of the solution of the invention.
