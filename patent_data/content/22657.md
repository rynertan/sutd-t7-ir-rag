## Abstract
A hinge device for tiltable windows, in particular inclined skylights. In a hinge device for tiltable windows, the base plate 14 of the sash portion is provided with a pivot pin 13 journalled in a guide member 5 which is connected to the base plate 1 of the frame portion in such a manner as to be mainly translatorily displaceable in relation thereto, whereby the pin during the initial opening movement of the window is moved downwards and outwards in relation to the frame portion. The sash portion of the hinge is also provided with a guide pin 15 which by co operation with guiding members 16, 17, 18 on the frame portion co ordinates the tilting movement of the sash portion about the pivot pin 13 with the movement of displacement of the pin with a view to obtain a sash movement allowing outer covering elements 3, 4 to be arranged with an efficient overlapping relationship in the hinge area. By maximum displacement of the pivot pin 13 the guide pin 15 gets clear of the guiding members 16, 17, 18 so that the sash is free to tilt further in the opening direction while a stop 19, 20, 21 prevents a rearward displacement of the guide member 5 .
