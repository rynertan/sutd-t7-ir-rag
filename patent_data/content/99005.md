# Magnetic disc apparatus.

## Abstract
A floppy disc 40 has a disc holder 44 provided at the center of a disc shaped recording medium 42 . The disc holder is formed of a magnetic material and has a central bore 46 at its center. A rotating member 82 has a cylindrical rotating shaft portion 84 and a flanged portion 86 and has a cylindrical bore 88 at its center. A center spindle 72 has a base portion 76 slidable within this cylindrical bore and an engaging portion 74 engageable with the central bore. A rotating shaft 68 of a motor 62 is fitted into the cylindrical bore, whereby the rotating member is driven to rotate by the driving operation of the motor. A compression spring 70 is mounted between the center spindle and the rotating shaft, whereby the center spindle is urged by this compression spring in a direction permitting the engaging portion to protrude from the rotating member. The disc holder and the rotating member are fixed to each other by the magnetic force. In this state, the engaging portion engages the central bore, and thus, the center of the floppy disc is brought into alignment with the center of the rotating member.
