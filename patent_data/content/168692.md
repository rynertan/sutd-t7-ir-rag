# Noncontact torque sensors.

## Abstract
A noncontact torque sensor for measuring torsional loading of a shaft the magnetic permeability of which changes in response to changes in torsion loading of the shaft. The sensor includes an excitation coil for generating a magnetic field passing through the shaft, and sensing coils for detecting changes in the magnetic field caused by changes in the permeability of the shaft. At least one pole is disposed adjacent the shaft, separated by an air gap, for coupling magnetic flux into or out of the shaft. The shaft has a radially extending surface adjacent to which the pole is disposed, and the air gap is represented by the axial spac ing between the pole and the radially extending surface. The air gap is thus axial, and does not vary with radial move ments of the shaft. In some of the embodiments described, plural poles are arranged symmetrically around the shaft such that other translational movements of the shaft produce offsetting changes in the sizes of various pole air gaps. The sensor is therefore relatively insensitive to vibra tions and other translational movements of the shaft relative to the poles.
