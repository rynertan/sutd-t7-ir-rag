# Control apparatus for an embroidering machine.

## Abstract
An embroidering machine comprises a plurality of needles 11, each mounted on a needle bar 8 and drivable by a driving bar 42. When patterns are to be embroidered in a workpiece it is necessary for certain needles to be temporarily non operative. Conventionally this has been done by means of a control shaft provided with appropriate projections and concavities. The conventional arrangement has not been found to be sufficiently flexible and so the invention provides a plurality of solenoids 23 which act through the agency of various connecting levers and members to render the needles temporarily non operative.
