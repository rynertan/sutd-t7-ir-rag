# METHODS OF PROCESSING A SILICON SUBSTRATE FOR THE FORMATION OF AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT THEREIN

## Abstract
A region of a silicon substrate is simultaneously etched and a silicon dioxide deposit formed on the sidewalls of the etched region by masking the substrate except in the region to be etched and subjecting the substrate to a plasma in a gas containing a fluorohalogenohydrocarbon and oxygen, the oxygen content being between 40 and 80 percent by volume. Thus, a trench 36 is plasma etched in a region of a silicon substrate 30 not protected by a masking layer 32 and a silicon dioxide deposit 34 is formed on the sidewalls of the trench 36 . The fluorohalogenohydrocarbon may be CCl₂F₂. Other hydrocarbons containing chlorine or bromine or iodine, as well as fluorine, may also be used.
