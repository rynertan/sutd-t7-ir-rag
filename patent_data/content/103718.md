# LOW ELASTICITY MODULUS FIXED ABRASIVE RIGID GRINDING MEDIA AND METHOD OF FABRICATING

## Abstract
The grinding media is formed of a concentration of agglomerate free hard particles including at least 50 per cent by weight of the media, wherein the particles are chelated by a dispersing agent, surface treated with a surtactant, mixed with polyether polyol and polyisocyanate plus a catalyst and water and thereafter rapidly cured in a closed mold which has been preheated to a temperature exceeding 50 C and is pressurized to 4.0 to 8.5 bar. The water reacts during curing to create a polyurea linkage and release COâ‚‚ as a blowing agent. The resulting media has a low elastic modulus with particles retained in a polyurethane urea open cell foam binder system. The media composition may also include an inorganic filler such as glass fibers not exceeding 30 per cent by weight of the media.
