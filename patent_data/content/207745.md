# Composition and method for coke retardant during hydrocarbon processing.

## Abstract
A method for inhibiting the formation and deposition of filamentous coke on metallic surfaces in contact with a hydrocarbon having a temperature of 315 to 760 DEG C 600 to 1400 DEG F characterized in that there is added to the hydrocarbon a sufficient amount for the purpose of an ammonium borate. A method for producing coke wherein i a hydrocarbon is charged into a zone and brought to a temperature of from about 426 to 704 DEG C 800 to 1300 DEG F to remove and recover in a separation zone any products which are volatized from and or formed in the hydrocarbon when heated to the temperature, and ii the remainder of the hydrocarbon is transferred through transfer lines to a coke forming area where such is cooled to form coke, and iii wherein undesired premature coke formation and deposition is normally experienced on the surfaces of the heating zone, products separation zone or transfer lines, characterized in that there is added to the hydrocarbon a sufficient amount of an ammonium borate to effectively inhibit the premature formation and deposition of the undesired filamentous coke in said heating zone, transfer lines andor volatile or product separation zone. A composition comprising an ammonlum borate in a glycollic solvent.
