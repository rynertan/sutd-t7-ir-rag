# A printing head drive apparatus for a printer.

## Abstract
A printing head drive circuit of a printer is mounted on the side of a carriage having a printing head 8 attached thereto in order to allow said carriage to act as a heat sink for heat generated within the drive elements 13 of the printing head. Hereby, no particular cooling means heat, sink, cooling fan and the like is required for the printing head drive elements 13 . In addition, a controller 1 and the associated heat generating parts can be completely sepa rated. Thus, it can be anticipated that the numer of parts and the cost required for assembling the whole structure can be reduced as well as to improve the reliability of the printing head drive circuit.
