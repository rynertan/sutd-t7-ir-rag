## Description
VAPOR LIQU it CONTACTING TRAY BACKGROUND OF THE ThENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to means for preventing weeping in a vapor liquid contacting tray having downcomer means arranged to discharge liquid onto an underlying tray in a contacting column.Description of the Prior Art U. S. Patent No. 3,410,540 to W. Bruckert discloses a vapor liquid contacting tray of a type adapted for mounting in a vapor liquid contacting column wherein a plurality of such trays are vertically spaced apart from one another. The disclosed tray is suitable for use in contacting systems such as wash columns, stripping columns, distillation colurns and the like. In this type of tray, a perforated horizontally disposed part of the tray is provided as the active portion of the tray surface area, and narrow trough like downcomers are spaced across the tray to transfer liquid to the next lower tray in the column, the downcomers thereby serving to provide separate perforated sections of the horizontal part therebetween. In more specific detail, the Bruckert multiple downcomer tray includes a perforated horizontal part providing an active major portion of the tray surface area to support a two phase fluid dispersion of vapor in liquid for mass exchange, and at least three narrow, trough like downcomer means evenly spaced across the tray in parallel relation to each other and extending through the perforated horizontal part as the sole liquid transfer means and comprising a minor portion of the tray surface area such that the horizontal part is divided into sections of substantially equal surface area per unit length of adjacent downcomer means.Each downcomer means comprises two spaced longitudinal inlet edges each adjacent to a section of the active portion perforated horizontal part and extending across the tray and imperforate relatively long and deep longitudinal side walls and imperforate relatively short transverse end walls which define a discrete inactive portion of the tray surface area, provide an inlet end section for receiving a fraction of the two phase fluid dispersion and permitting vapor to disengage therefrom, and provide an outlet section for collecting disengaged liquid and discharging such disengaged liquid from the tray.Each downcomer means also comprises a liquid sealable outlet means which may suitably be constituted by a horizontally extending floor member attached to the outlet end section of the downcomer, having a multiplicity of longitudinally spaced spout openings apertures therein so constructed that a sealing effect against vapor penetration may be provided by a stable head loss of liquid passing therethrough such that a pool of disengaged liquid may be maintained in the downcomer means. The above described Bruckert multiple downcomer tray has been proven to be highly efficient and is widely used in practice as a result of its numerous desirable operating characteristics. The tray is capable of operating efficiently at high liquid flow rates without the problems of excessive entrainment, downcomer flooding, hydrostatic head gradient, or high pressure drop. On the Bruckert tray, froth height the height of the two phase fluid dispersion of vapor and liquid on the active area of the tray surface is control able over wide liquid and vapor flow rates, thereby permitting high rangeability of the gas liquid contacting system and reasonable vapor phase pressure drop. Furthermore, the hydraulic behavior of the Bruckert tray is accurately predictable.As a result of these operating characteristics, theBruckert tray may be employed in a vapor liquid contacting column having tray spacings, i.e., the vertical distance between adjacent contacting trays in the column, lower than is possible for other conventional trays such as those of the cross flow or corrugated types. In this manner, the Bruckert trays provide more mass transfer capacity per unit column volume with lower power consumption than contacting columns containing such other conventional trays. Despite the foregoing advantages, however, it has been observed that Bruckert multiple downcomer trays in operation are subject to the disadvantageous phenomenon of penetrative weeping. Penetrative weeping is caused by the impact of the liquid flowing from the downcomers of one tray in a contacting column onto the active portion of the tray surface area of the underlying tray. The momentum gained by the liquid in its fall adds to the hydrostatic head of the froth on the active portion of tray surface area of the underlying tray, thus producing a localized area of weeping. Weeping involves liquid flow through the gas flow openings of the active portion of tray surface area, in place of the vapor which would otherwise flow through such gas flow openings.Since weeping is synonomous with reduced vapor flow, the vapor that is prevented from passing through the penetrative weeping zone must pass through another part of the tray surface area, thereby creating increased superficial vapor velocities in these other zones.In addition, any liquid which weeps through the tray surface area active portion is not available to contribute to froth height on the tray surface. All of these factors lead to reduced efficiency, higher pressure drop, higher entrainment and reduced flooding limits of operability for the tray. In addition to the above described disadvantageous phenomenon of penetrative weeping, it has also been found that the Bruckert multiple downcomer tray is in some applications subject to the occurrence of liquid maldistribution on the active area of the tray surface. In applications where the Bruckert multiple downcomer tray has a large diameter and is characterized by large spacing distances between adjacent parallel downcomers, liquid discharged from the downcomers of an overlying tray anc impinging on the active surface of the tray tends to flow by the shortest distance to the downcomer of the tray, leaving other active surface area regions relatively stagnant. The rising vapor contacting liquid on the area of the tray surface must therefore contact liquid of varying age .It is easily verified both theoretically and experimentally that such maldistribution of liquid and resulting nonuniformity cf vapor liquid contacting inevitably leads t a reduction in tray efficiency. It has been proposed to overcome such liquid maldistribution problem by the provision of vertically upwardly extending guide wall members disposed on the main top surface of the tray horizontal part, to direct the flow of liquid on the main top surface of the tray and thereby avoid liquid maldistribution thereon. Such provision, while effective in overcoming the liquid maldistribuion problem, unfortunately exacerbates the aforementioned penetrative weeping phenomenon. This is due te the fact that such guide wall members tend to increase the fluid residence time of the liquid on the tray surface active area, so that greater opportunity exists for liquid to pass through the perforations in the tray horizontal part, particularly in the discharged liquid impact area of the tray s active area. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved vapor liquid contacting tray wshich is resistant to liquid penetrative weeping. It is another object of the invention to provide an improved vapor liquid contacting tray of the multiple downcomer type. It is still another object of the invention to provide an improved vapor liquid contacting tray of the multiple downcomer type having vertically upwardly extending guide wall members disposed on the main top surface of the tray horizontal part to direct the flow of liquid on the main flat top surface and avoid liquid maldistribution thereon, which is resistant to liquid penetrative weeping. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing disclosure and the appended claims. SUMMARY OF THE IErVENTION This invention relates to a vapor liquid contacting tray of a type employed in a contacting column wherein a plurality of such trays are vertically spaced apart from one another. Briefly, the invention relates to a vapor liquid contacting tray for effecting contact between a rising vapor and liquid flowing across a horizontally disposed part of the tray to liquid downcomer means extending through such horizontal part. The horizontal part has main top and bottom surfaces with a plurality of openings distributed across the surfaces and extending through the horizontal part for vapor flow therethrough. The downcomer means are arranged to discharge liquid onto liquid impingement area portions of the horizontal part main top surface of an underlying tray in the contacting column. In the improvement of the invention, a plurality of slot means is distributed across the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part main top surface to provide vapor flow for prevention of weeping of impinging liquid, discharged from downcomer means of an overlying tray, through the openings in the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part.Each such slot means substantially overlies a fixed size opening through the horizontal part and has a top surface raised from the main top surface, with at least two spaced apart edge sections of the raised top surface separated from the main top surface each forming a slot opening therewith and side wall means bounding the slot openings and joining the top surface of the slot means to the tray horizontal part main top surface, such that the raised top surface and side wall means together bridge the overlaid fixed size opening through the horizontal part and provide flow comaunication for vapor flow from the overlaid fixed size opening through the slot openings of the slot means, whereby liquid discharged from the downcomer means of an overlying tray in the contacting column and impinging onto the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part main top surface is imparted with horizontally directed vapor thrust by vapor issuing from the slot openings of the slot means, to prevent weeping of liquid through the fixed size openings in the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal nart. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the above described slot means are employed in a multiple downcomer vapor liquid contacting tray of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,L10,540 to W. Bruckert. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a perspective view of a multiple downcomer vapor liquid contacting tray according to the prior art.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In the following description, the length of the downcomer means of a multiple downcomer tray refers to the horizontal dimension normal to the direction of liquid flow approaching the downcomer. The width of each downcomer means of a multiple downcomer tray refers to the dimension of the downcomer means inlet parallel to the direction of the approaching liquid. Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a vapor liquid contacting tray of the type disclosed and claimed in Bruckert, U. S. Patent No. 3,510,540, incorporated herein.to the extent pertinent. The tray features multiple, narrow, trough like downcomer means 10 which are evenly spaced across the distillation tray surface and exextend through a horizontal part 12 of the tray such that the horizontal part contacting means is divided into sections of substantially equal surface area per unit length of adjacent downcomer means. Thus, by way of example, the ratio of the surface area of the section 12a of the perforated horizontal part 12 of Figure 1 to the combined length of the adjacent downcomer means 10a and 10b is substantially equal to the ratio of the surface area of the section 12b to the length of the adjacent downcomer means lOc. To provide the necessary equality of surface areas per unit length of adjacent downcomer means, at least three and preferably more such downcomer means are provided, equispaced across the tray surface as shown in Figure 1. The vapor liquid contacting tray of Figure 1 effects contact between a rising vapor and liquid flowing across the horizontally disposed part of the tray to liquid downcomer means. The horizontal part has main top and bottom surfaces with a plurality of fixed size openings distributed across the surfaces and extending through the horizontal part for vapor flow therethrough.Each downcomer means comprises two spaced longitudinal inlet edges 7, 8 each adjacent to a section of the active portion of the tray surface and extending across the tray.These longitudinal inlet edges are associated with imperforate relatively long and deep longitudinal side walls 14 and imperforate relatively short transverse end walls 9 which provide a discrete inactive portion of the tray surface area, provide an upper inlet end section for receiving a fraction of a two phase fluid dispersion and permitting vapor to disengage therefrom, and provide a lower outlet end section for collecting disengaged liquid and discharging such disengaged liquid from the tray.Each downcomer means further comprises a horizontally extending floor member attached to the outlet end section of the downcomer having a multiplicity of longitudinally spaced spout openings therein so constructed that a sealing effect against vapor penetration may be provided by a stable head loss of liquid passing therethrough such that a pool of disengaged liquid may be maintained in the downcomer means.The tray thus comprises precisely defined areas for vapor flow upward through the perforated horizontal part 12 and precisely defined areas for liquid flow downward through the multiple downcomer means 10. By disengaged liquid is meant liquid which is freed of a substantial portion of the vapor in the original froth, so that the apparent density of the disengaged liquid is substantially higher than the froth on the active tray surface. The apparent density of two phase fluids may be expressed as the volume fraction of liquid it contains.Thus, the apparent density of active froth, referred to that of clear liquid, may be only 30Z whereas the apparent density of disengaged liquid in the downcomer should preferably be above 607.. In a properly functioning downcomer, the disengaged liquid acts as a homogeneous fluid and any residual vapor content not released in the disengagement section is swept downward with liquid through the downcomer end section. As shown in Figure 1, the multiple downcomers 10 are positioned parallel to one another across the tray surface. Each downcomer extends substantially from one edge of the tray to an opposite edge along the respective chord of the tray defined by the downcomer. These multiple narrow, trough like downcomers have been discovered to be capable of handling far more fluid for the area they occupy than other prior art downcomers. High vapor capacity at low tray spacing and small contacting column diameter becomes practical with multiple downcomer trays as a result of their ability to control the froth height at a low, uniform level. Low uniform froth height is obtained by means of the long overflow inlet associated with the plurality of downcomer means spaced and distributed across the tray area. The amount of tray area serviced by each unit length of downcomer inlet is small, and consequently the crest of froth flowing over the inlet is very low. Since the total crest height is low, the variation in crest height attendant changes in liquid and vapor flow rates is greatly reduced as com pared with the inlets of other prior art downcomers.The side walls 14 of the multiple downcomer means are usually extended upward beyond the froth carrying surface of the tray to provide raised inlet weirs of uniform height as shown in Figure 1. The crest height is superimposed on a substantial depth of froth fixed by the weir height and any variation in crest height will be a small fraction of the total froth height. The froth height and the concomitant pressure drop are virtually uneffected by variations in liquid loading and therefore far higher loadings are obtainable than possible with trays such as conventional cross flow trays. As a general rule, adequate froth height control will be achieved with the multiple downcomer trays by providing between about 1.0 and 5.0 feet of downcomer inlet length per square foot of total tray area. If loading is so low that less than about 1.0 foot of downcomer inlet length can serve a square foot tray of area efficiently, crest control, gradients, and downcomer capacity are not highly critical and can be handled reasonably well on conventional cross flow trays, perhaps assisted by vapor propulsion.On the other hand, if more than about 5.0 feet of downcomer inlet length is provided per square foot of tray area, then it is apparent that even though downcomers which make optimum use of their area are used, they still occupy a large fraction of the total tray surface for example, 5.0 feet of downcomer inlet length per square foot of tray area provided by two inch wide downcomers results in about 40 utilization of the tray area for downcomers. More than 5.0 feet of downcomer inlet length per square foot of tray area requires very close spacing of the downcomers and leaves such a narrow width of perforated area between the downcomers that it becomes difficult to receive the liquid falling on the surface of the tray from the tray above without spilling a portion directly into the downcomers.Thus downcomer area representing 40 tray utilization is about the preferred maximum percentage to be employed in multiple downcomer trays. The lower limits on the downcomer inlet length and downcomer width also result in 7 preferred min rmum percentage of the tray area occupied by the multiple downcomers. In order to provide the requisite downcomer liquid capacity to handle the greatly increased flow rates capable of achievement with multiple downcomer trays, the width of the downcomer inlet on multiple downcomer trays should be between about 0.08 0.4 of the center to center spacing of the downcomers across the tray. Referring now toFigure 2, there is shown a sectional elevational view of portions of two adjacent vapor liquid contacting trays constructed in accordance with the teachings of the aforementionedBruckert patent, U.S.Patent No. 3,410,540. As shown, the adjacent trays in the contacting column are oriented such that their respective downcomer means are horizontally aligned at 90 relative to one another. In this manner, the liquid which is discharged by the downcomer means of the overlying tray falls onto the sections of the horizontally disposed tray part between adjacent downcomers on the underlying tray. Figure 2 clearly illustrates the weeping liquid penetration phenomenon which tends to occur in trays constructed in accordance with the prior art teachings. As shown, the perforated horizontal part 12 provides the active major portion of the tray surface area to support a two phase fluid mixture of vapor in liquid for mass exchange. Each downcomer comprises imperforate side walls 14 which define a discrete inactive portion of the tray and provides an inlet end section 16 for receiving a fraction of the twophase mixture from the adjacent section of the perforated horizontal part 12 and permitting the vapor to disengage therefrom.The imperforate side walls 14 also provide an outlet end section 18 for collecting the liquid disengaged from such two phase mixture and discharging the disengaged liquid 21 from the tray. Each downcomer further consists of an outlet means 20 which controls discharge of disengaged liquid.Visual observation of the internal operation of a vaporliquid contacting column employing trays as shown in Figure 2 has shown that the momentum of the falling disengaged liquid 21 when added to the hydrostatic head of froth on the tray surface of the underlying tray is sufficient to vercome the dry plate pressure drop of the rising gas so that a substantial quantity of liquid passes in streams 22 directly through the perforated horizontal part 12 prior to any significant gas liquid contacting. Such liquid weeping involves bypassing of the liquid on the underlying tray and contributes to lowered tray efficiency.This is because, as shown in Figure 2, the liquid in the discharged streams 21 from the outlet means of the downcomer of the overlying tray passes directly through the froth on the underlying tray and issues in the streams 22 from the latter tray, so that such liquid is not involved in the intimate gas liquid contacting operation which is occurring on the perforated horizontal part sections of the underlying tray. Figure 3 shows a perspective view of two superimposed vapor liquid contacting trays constructed in accordance with the present invention, such as may be usefully employed to overcome the deleterious weeping behavior as shown in Figure 2, described above. Trays 100 and 101 in Figure 3 are vapor liquid contacting trays of a type employed in a contacting column wherein a plurality of such trays are vertically spaced apart from one another for effecting contact between a rising vapor and liquid flowing across the horizontally disposed part 12 of the tray to liquid downcomer means 10 extending through the horizontal part. The horizontal part 12 has main top and bottom surfaces with a plurality of openings 6 distributed across the surfaces and extending through the horizontal part for vapor flow there through.The downcomer means of tray 100 are arranged to discharge liquid onto liquid impingement area portions 30 of the horizontal part main top surface of the underlying tray 101 in the contactint column As shown, a plurality of slot means 31 is distributed across the liquid impingement area portions 30 of the tray horizontal part main top surface to provide vapor flow for prevention of weeping of impinging liquid, discharged from downcomer means of an overlying tray, through the horizontal part openings in the liquid impingement area portions 30 of the tray horizontal part 12. The constructional details of the slot means employed in the Figure 3 embodiment are shown more clearly in Figures 4 and 5. As shown, each of the slot means 31 substantially overlies a fixed size opening 6 through the tray horizontal part and has a top surface 33 raised from the main top surface of the tray horizontal part. As shown in this embodiment, top surface 33 is substantially parallel to the main top surface of the tray horizontal part. Two spaced apart edge sections 33a, 33b of the raised top surface 33 are separated from the main top surface, each forming a slot opening 34 therewith.As shown, slot opening 34 is of elongated shape and has greater width than height such configuration is preferred from a standpoint of ease of fabrication when the slot means are punched from the tray horizontal part and promotes good froth stability on the main top surface of the tray horizontal part in the liquid impingement area portions thereof.Side wall means 32 bound the slot openings and join the top surface 33 of the slot means to the main top surface of the tray horizontal part 12, such that the raised top surface 33 and side wall means 32 together bridge the overlaid fixed size opening through the horizontal part and provide flow com munication for vapor flow from the overlaid fixed size opening through the slot openings of the slot means,whereby liquid discharged from the downcomer means of an over lying tray in the contacting column and impinging onto the liquid impingement area portions 30 of the tray horizontal part main toD surface is imparted with horizontally directed vapor thrust by vapor issuing from the slot openings of the slot means, to prevent weeping of liquid through the fixed sized openings in the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part. Referring to Figure 5, the slot opening 34, as mentioned, may suitably have a width minimum width b which is greater than the height c of the slot opening. In general, the height of the slot opening c should be substan tially larger than the thickness a of the perforated horzontal part, in order to allow sufficient passage of gas through the slot opening for vapor flow.The angle 8 formed by the side wall means 32 and a perpendicular from an edge of the raised top surface 33 may suitably lie within the range of from 0 to 60 . The slot means shown in Figures 4 and 5 may be formed integral with the tray plate member, as example may be effected by a punching operation or, alternatively, the slot means may be formed from separate structural components joined to the tray horizontal part main top surface over the overlaid fixed size opening cherein.In the slot means shown in Figures 6 and 5, the raised top surface 33 of the slot means is rectangular in shape and the aforementioned edge sections of the slot means correspond to the longitudinal edges of the rectangular top surface, with the transverse edges of the rectangular top surface being joined to the side wall means, whereby the slot means forms two opposed, parallel slot openings transversely spaced apart from one another. Tm the vapor liquid contacting tray of this invention, the tray horizontal part has main top and bottom surfaces with a plurality of openings distributed across such surfaces and extending through the horizontal part for vapor flow therethrough. In the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part, these openings are of fixed size as employed in conjunction with the slot means of this invention. In the remaining portions of the horizontal part, i.e., the non impingement areas, the openings are preferably also of fixed size, but may be of variable size, as for example may be provided by valve means of a type coventionally used and well known to those skilled in the art. Figure 6 shows another embodiment of a slot means such as may usefully be employed in the practice of the present invention. The slot means 330 overlies a fixed size opening 306 through the horizontal part and has a top surface 333 raised from the main top surface 300. Three spaced apart edge sections 301 of the raised top surface 333 are separated from the main top surface 300 each forming a slot opening 340 therewith. Side wall means 320 bound the slot openings and join the top surface 333 of the slot means 330 to the main top surface 300, such that the raised top surface and side wall means together bridge the overlaid fixed size opening through the horizontal part end provide flow communication for vapor flow from the overlaid fixed size opening through the slot openings of the slot means. In this embodiment, the raised top surface 333 of the slot means is triangular in shape and the edge sections correspond to portions of each of the side edges of the triangular top surface.The apex edges of the triangular top surface are joined to the side wall means, whereby the slot means forms three slot openings circumferentially spaced apart from one another. Figure 7 shows one preferred pattern of the triangular slots of Figure 6 on a portion cf tray deck tray horizontal part . The pattern of slot means 330 on the tray deck can be viewed as being formed by an array of equilateral triangles 400. Each slot means 330 is located at the apex of 6 adjacent triangles and as a result, the gas issuing from each slot opening is opposed by the gas issuing from the slot openings of two adjacent slot means. In this configuration, the open area of the tray horizontal part can be varied by either changing the height or width of the slot openings, thereby enlarging the slot openings, or by altering the size of the equilateral triangles forming the slot pattern.An alternative pattern is also shown in the drawing of Figure 7 by inclusion of the triangular slot means shown in dotted line representation. In the alternative pattern, the triangular slot means are also located in the center of alternating equilateral triangles and provide a somewhat more compact slotting pattern on the liquid impingement area of the tray horizontal part top surface. Men the slot means of the present invention are employed in a vapor liquid contacting tray of the multiple downcomer type, the surface area of the horizontal part is preferably between 50 and 90 of the cross sectional area of the tray, with the remainder of the cross sectional area of the tray being constituted by downcomer means. At horizontal part surface area values of less than 50 , the downcomer means become so closely spaced together that it is difficult to receive the liquid falling onto the surface of the tray horizontal part from the tray above without spilling a portion directly into the downcomer means, A horizontal part surface area values of about 90 , the horizontal part surface area becomes so large relative to the downcomer area that single downcomers may be usefully employed.Although the slot means of the present invention have been described particularly in application to trays of the multiple downcomer type, it will be recognized that their utility is not so limited, and that the slot means of the present invention may be usefully employed on other conventional type trays, such as cross flow trays having downcomers which are arranged to discharge liquid onto liquid impingement area portions of the horizontal part main top surface of an underlying tray in a contacting column. In the general practice of the invention, the open area of the openings in the tray horizontal part will generally be in the range of from i to 20 of the surface area of the horizontal part.Open area values above 20 are not generally employed due to their associated low pressure drop which prevents a suitably high froth height from being maintained on the tray horizontal part and leads to excessively high degree of weeping over the entire horizontal part surface. Although the slot means of this invention have been described above as being distributed across the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part main top surface, the liquid impingement area portions being the areas of liquid impingement of the liquid discharged from downcomer means of an overlying tray in a contacting column.it will be recognized that in some applications it may be desir able to distribute such slot means across the entire horizon tal part main top surface such that the slot means overlie all of the fixed size openings thereon. On the other hand, it may be desirable to distribute the slot means only across the liquid impingement area portions of the horizontal part top surface.In the latter instance, wherein the slot means are distributed only across the liquid impingement area por tions of the tray horizontal part main top surface, with the remainder of the horizontal part main top surface having a plurality of fixed size openings distributed thereacross.it may be desirable in many instances to maintain the percent open area of the horizontal part substantially constant across its full extent, so that any small zone on a trav has the same percent open area as any other zone.When employing slot means in just the liquid impingement areas of the horizontal part main top surface, however, it is necessary to adjust the total open area of the slot means to account for the difference in the orifice coefficients between the twt geometries i.e., fixed size perforation openings and slot openings by the following equation AA Cp CA Ap wherein AA open area of the slot openings on the liquid impingement area portions of the hori zontal part main top surface, as based on the surface area of the horizontal Dart Cp orifice coefricient of the been ings on the remaining portions of the tray horizontal part main top surface CA orifice coefficient of the slot openings on the liquid impingement area portions of the rrav horizontal part main top surface and Ap Z open area of the openings on the re maining portions of the horizontal part main top surface, as based on the surface area ç. ,ne horizontal part. In accordance with this relationship between the open area of the slot openings on the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part main top surface and the open area of the openings on the remaining portions of the tray horizontal part main top surface, the flow of gas through the open area over all sections of the tray may be kept substantially uniform. Figure 8 is a plan view of a vapor liquid contacting tray constructed in accordance with the present invention. The contacting tray includes four narrow, troughlike downcomer means lOt, lOb, lOc and lOd evenly spaced across the tray in parallel relation to each other and extending through the horizontal part 12 as the sole liquid transfer means and comprising a minor portion of the tray surface area such that the horizontal part is divided into sections of substantially equal surface area per unit length of adjacent downcomer means. The horizontal part 12 has main top and bottom surfaces with a plurality of openings 6 distributed across such surfaces and extending through the plate member for vapor flow therethrough.A plurality of slot means 31 are distributed across the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part main top surface to provide vapor flow for prevention of weeping of impinging liquid,discharged from downcomer means of an overlying tray,through the fixed size openings in the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part. In connection with the use of slot means distributed across the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part main top surface, the trav is nro vided with a number of vertically upwardly extending guide wall members 4 joined at a lower edge to the main top surface of the horizontal part, to direct the flow of liquid on the main top surface and avoid liquid maldistribution thereon.As shown, the guild wall members 4 are disposed in the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part main top surface, but such wall members may be deployed on any portion of the tray horizontal part main top surface. The function of the guide wall members in theFigure 8 embodiment is to channel the liquid impinging on the liquid impingement areas of the perforated horizontal part and conduct such flow of liquid to the non impingement areas of the horizontal part main top surface. In this manner, the froth height of the liquid dispersion on the tray main top surface is made substantially uniform and loss of gas liquid contacting efficiency attributable to liquid maldistribution on the tray surface is avoided. The advantages of the present invention will be shown more fully by the example set forth below. EXAMPLE In this example, a number of multiple downcomer vapor liquid contacting trays were evaluated for penetrative weeping, including trays constructed in accordance with the prior art and trays constructed in accordance with the present invention. Each of the vapor liquid contacting trays had a downcomer configuration which was similar to that shown in Figure 8 herein, with each tray having 4 downcomers, a tray diameter of 5300 mm, a tray thickness of 2.5 mm, a downcomer center to center distance of 1173 mm, a downcomer length for the smaller peripheral downcomers of 3472 mm and a downcomer length for the larger central downcomers of 4578 mm. Each of the downcomers had a width of 152 mm and a height of 160 mm, including a height above the perforated horizontal part of the tray of 51 mm.Each of the trays had a percent open area of 18.2, based on the total surface area of the horizontal part. In the evaluation,six tray configurations were tested, as designated trays 1 6 below. Trays 1 and 2 featured a horizontal part having a plurality of fixed size openings distributed across the surf aces thereof and extending through the horizontal part for vapor flow therethrough, but without the provision of any slot means according to the present invention. The diameter of the fixed size perforation openings distributed across the horizontal part was 6.35 mm. Trays 1 and 2 were identical in configuration, except that tray 2 was provided with a plurality of vertically upwardly extending guide wall members joined at a lower edge to the main flat top surface of the horizontal part, in a pattern similar to that shown in Figure 8 herein.Trays 3 and 4 were provided with a plurality of slot means distributed across the restricted liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part main top surface. The slot means on these trays were of a type such as is shown in Figures 4 and 5 herein, with a sLot opening height of 3.25 mm, a slot opening upper width of 12 mm and a slot opening lower width of 18.5 mm, with side wall means bounding the slot opening and being oriented with respect to the tray horizontal part at an angle of 45 . The slot means in trays 3 and 4 were oriented to cause vapor flow parallel to the sides of the tray downcomers and were transversely staggered.The slots were located in just the impingement areas of the discharged liquid and their open area was adjusted by the factor 1.15 as a result, the percent open area in the impingement areas was 20.95 while the percent open area of the remaining perforated tray was 18.22 percent. Trays3 and 4 were identically constructed, with the exception that tray 4 had a plurality of vertically upwardly extending guide wall members joined at a lower edge to the main top surface of the horizontal part in the impingement areas, such as shown in Figure 8 herein. Trays 5 and 6 were slotted with the same type slots as trays 3 and 4, except that in the former case the slot means were oriented to cause vapor flow perpendicular to the sides of the tray downcomers and were transversely staggered.Trays 5 and 6 were identically constructed, except that tray 6 was provided with a plurality of vertically upwardly extending guide wall members joined at a lower edge to the main top surface of the horizontal part in the liquid impingement areas, such as shown in Figure 8 herein. During the test evaluation, liquid penetrative weeping was measured for each of the aforementioned trays 1 6 in air water contacting service. In operation, air was supplied to the test tray by an air blower at a volu 3 metric flow. rate of 1310.29 feet sec., and water was supplied at a volumetric rate of 6.756 cu. ft. sec. To measure the rate of penetrative weeping, a funnel was located beneath one of the liquid impact area portions of the tray horizontal part and penetrating liquid was collected in a 45 gal. drum. The value of collected penetrating liquid was used to project an overall penetrative weeping rate by direct proportioning. The results of the evaluative testing are shown below in Table I.

In comparing test trays 3 and 5, it is to be noted that test tray 5, constructed with slots oriented perpendicular to the side of the tray downcomer, affords a small degree of improvement relative to tray 3, which employed slots oriented parallel to the side of the tray downcomer. The reduction in penetrative weeping afforded by the slot means of the present invention can be character ized by two distinct functional a. ects. First, the downward momentum component of the flowing liquid discharged from the downcomer means of the overlying tray is dissipated by the raised top surface of the slot means. Thus, the liquid is prevented from freely passing through the overlaid fixed size opening. Secondly, liquid on the tray plate member near the slot means is horizontally displaced by the kinetic energy of the vapor emitted from the slot openings. In this manner, the hydrostatic head of liquid on the tray in the liquid impingement area portions of the tray horizontal part is maintained at a suitably low level. A comparison of test trays 1 and 2, 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 shows that the use of guide wall members to overcome liquid maldistribution on the tray surface aggrevates the penetrative weeping problem. Because the use of guide wall members increases the liquid residence time on most of the tray area, a correspondingly greater opportunity exists for liquid to pass through the horizontal part perforations especially in the downcomer discharged liquid inpact area. As a result, it becomes all the more important, when guide wall members are employed, to curtail as much of the weeping as possible without creating countervailinR effects. By utilizing the slot means of the present invention in the downcomer liquid discharge impact area, such weeping can be significantly curtailed. Although preferred embodiments have been described ed in detail, it wIl be appreciated that other embodiments are contemplated only with modification of the disclosed features, as being within the scope of the invention.
