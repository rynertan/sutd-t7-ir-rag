# Composition containing atactic polypropylene and a filler treated with an organo titanate chelate.

## Abstract
Atactic polypropylene is upgraded to form composites which are workable by conventional thermoplastic shaping techniques by admixing the amorphous polypropylene with a filler which has been treated with an organo titanate chelate. Preferred fillers are the reinforcing fillers such as the silicates and silica. The organo titanate chelates are alpha, omega alkylene titanates having two non hydrolyzable groups.
