## Description
OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS FOR VIEWING A SAMPLE SURFACE The invention relates to optical instruments for viewing a sample surface.Such instruments are used in polarimetry and ellipsometry. Description of the Prior ArtT. Smith wrote an article entitled An Automated Scanning Ellipsometer in Surface 56, No. 1 212 220 June 1976 which shows an automated ellipsometer in FIG. 1 thereof with a polarized beam splitter 4 which supplies a fraction of the beam from the light source 1. The beam, which passes through the polarizer, is reflected from the surface of a sample.A portion of the reflected beam reaches a 45 analyzer prism 6 and it is measured by a detector 8. Another portion of the reflected beam 7 reaches a second analyzer prism which splits the portion of the reflected beam it receives into parallel p and perpendicularly s polarized segments.There are detectors connected to receive the separate p and s segments.It should be noted that the prism 6 and the prism 7 are separate but juxtaposed. Accordingly, some of the light in the beam reflected from the surface of the sample S may not be received by any one of the three detectors 8, 9, and 10.In addition, three detectors are used to measure the reflected beam rather than the two detectors required in our system. Furthermore, since the beam is split from side to side, the detectors are dependent upon the uniformity of the beam from side to side. Smith requires careful alignment of the beam.The sources of error in Smith overcome by the present arrangement are 1 alignment of the beam 2 uniformity of the beam, and 3 uniformity of the sample. In addition, the present arrangement permits focussing upon sample object surface areas as small as 1 mil whereas Smith cannot, 2 since his error is on the order of a few mils , Smith states that he requires uniform illumination p. 219 and a large area p. 213 . At page 220 of the Smith article under comments made at the conference where the article was presented, it is stated by M. J. Dignam Rather than having two beams, we had in mind placing a reflected beam splitter with plates at normal incidence and then analyzing each of the beams with a polarizing splitter as you have done. The polarizing beam splitter is properly oriented to get all the information from a single beam. You still have the calibration problems and the calibration of the beam splitter but I think it can be done with a single beam . That arrangement would use four detectors at the output end in place of the three detectors of Smith and the two detectors employed here as we interpret that statement made by M. J. Dignam.The result is a more complex set of twice as many data outputs, and five detectors instead of three with the attendant disadvantages of more sources of error and cost of computation. The present system employs a novel technique, which permits use of only three detectors, whereas heretofore, it had been believed that four detectors would be required. Summary of the InventionIn accordance with this invention an instrument is provided comprising a source of a polarized light beam directed towards a sample position.Means is provided for supporting a sample in the sample position. A polarizing beam splitter is supported for reception of the reflection of the beam from the surface of a sample in the sample position and a pair of detectors for p and s beams is positioned to receive the p and s portions of said light beam from the polarizing beam splitter. Preferably the source includes means for polarization of the light beam, which preferably polarizes the light beam at 450, or provides circular polarization of the light beam. Preferably a beam splitter splits the light beam and directs a portion thereof to a third detector and directs the remainder of the light beam to the sample. The invention therefore provides an optical instrument comprising a source of polarised light beam directed towards a sample position, means for supporting a sample in the sample position, and analys Aing means for reception of the beam reflected from the sample characterised in that the analysing means comprise a polarising beam splitter and a pair of detectors positioned respectively to receive the perpendicularly polarised portions of the light beam emerging from the beam splitter.The invention will now be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 1 shows an optical polarimeter system in accordance with this invention.FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram of an optical arrangement and sensors in a modified polarimeter system in accordance with this invention.FIG. 3 shows beams of light refracted and reflected at an interface with p polarization. Description of the Preferred EmbodimentFIG. 1 shows a chamber containing sample S held in place on fixture F by means of pressure induced by vacuum line V. A laser L in this paricular case shown as about eleven inches long is directed towards beam splitter BS which passes a portion of the beam to photodiode D and reflects the 0 remainder of the beam towards the sample S. The beam reflected from beam splitter BS passes through polarizer P. In principle polarizer P can be omitted since the laser beam is polarized. Polarizer P enhances the polarization. The beam is directed at the sample at an angle PI of 700 with respect to a line normal to the surface of the sample S.Angles which are preferred range from a few degrees to close to 900. At 450 a measurement of a single interface cannot be done but a multiple layer structure can be measured. The beam reflected from the surface of the sample is passed through aperture A which eliminates spurious light to a polarizing beam splitter PBS comprising preferably aWollaston prism which produces a first beam directed to the photodiodeD and a second beam directed to a second photodiode D with the two p 5 beams separated in the plane defined by the beams by an angle of 200.Any angle can be used, but larger angles are preferred in a practical application. The outputs of sensor D , sensor D and sensor D pass o p 5 through lines G, H and I respectively to the interface which is connected by cable J to the data processing unit. As will be explained below, the polarizing beam splitter produces two differen polarizations of the beam for the two photodiodes D and D p sThe polarimeter of the instant invention is an instrument of the static photometric type and its resolving time is limited only by the rise times of its photodetectors. As an alternative, beam splitter BS and sensor D can be omitted if a 0 standard reference sample is available to calibrate measurements. The purpose of beam splitter BS and sensor D is to eliminate the effects of o variation of the intensity of the laser beam from laser L. The polarimeter, shown in FIG. 2, utilizes a single polarized beam polarized, say, at 450 to the plane of incidence from a small HeNe laser L or any other collimated beam in combination with a polarizer . A beam splitter BS directs a fraction of the incident beam to normalizing detector D . A polarizing beam splitter PBS such as a Wollaston prism 0 splits the reflected beam from sample S into its p parallel and s perpendicular polarization components which are then monitored by detectors D and D p s From the light intensities, I , I and I , recorded by detectors D , D 0 p 5 0 p and D , the p and s intensity reflection coefficients R and R can s p s be derived.For example, for light polarized at 45 and an incident beam splitting ratio of 1 2 i.e., I equals one third of the source 0 beam intensity , the intensity reflection coefficients are given by EMI5.1 It is shown in equations below that knowledge of R and R is sufficient p 5 to determine the polarization state of the reflected light or equivalently, the complex index of refraction of the sample . This statement is valid for all angles of incidence other than 0 normal incidence , 450 and 900 grazing incidence .Since there is no mechanical motion during the operation of this instrument and the needed optical information is recorded by three stationary photodetectors, the response time of the ellipsometer is determined solely by the detectors rise times which can be very small. Therefore, this instrument measures variations in refractive indices and extinction coefficients in very rapid time scales.The measurement accuracy of this device is highly dependent on its photodetectors. Highly linear detectors such as solid state photodiodes are necessary for good performance. In the absence of a computer the detectors should be accurately calibrated and matched. However, variations in source intensity are cancelled out since only intensity ratios are used in data reductions.Instead of a plane polarized incident beam, a circularly polarized beam can be used. A 1 4 wavelength plate suitably oriented will convert any plane polarized light to circular polarization. This will not affect the operation of the ellipsometer because the only difference is 900 of phase delay between the p and flus polarized components which does not affect the photodetectors. The results are identical to those obtained using a 450 polarized incident beam.In an experimental device, samples were measured with reasonable accuracy at an incident angle of 700. These included dielectrics glasses , semiconductors silicon and conductors gold and titanium. The source was a 5 mw EeNe laser and the detectors were photodiode Op amp combinations , with a rise time of about 100 nanoseconds. The intensity reflection coefficients Rp and Rs could be observed directly through the use of two digital ratiometers. Practical applications of this invention include measurements of values as follows 1. Optical changes in materials undergoing short intense heat pulses.2. Optical changes in materials undergoing fast chemical physical reactions.3. High resolution film growth rates on substrates.In general, this invention provides a fast response, general purpose polarimeter simple design, no moving parts .The amplitude reflection coefficients for plane polarized light are given by Fresnel Eqns, Ref. 1 EMI6.1 EMI7.1 where r5 and rp are the amplitude reflection coefficients, N1 and N2 are the indices of refraction of the media Cliaht is incident from medium 1 onto medium 2 and is the angle of incidence as shown in FIG. 3.FIG. 3 shows reflection and refraction at an interface with p polarization. N N2 N1 is the relative index of refraction. In order to include absorption, N1, N2 and N are complex numbers and have the form N n ik where n is the real index of refraction and k is known as the extinction coefficient. From equation 1, N can be expressed in terms of r5 as EMI7.2 Using equations 2 and 3, rp can be derived as EMI7.3 Cor equivalently EMI7.4 Equation 4 can now be used to yieldEMI7.5 where is the s polarization phase shift on reflection i.e., rs rs ei s and Rp, Rs are the p and s polarization intensity reflection coefficients respectively given by Rp rp Ãª andRs rs Ãª. Knowledge of Rp, R5 and is therefore sufficient to determine both the amplitude phase of the s polarization amplitude reflection coefficient rs and therefore also N n ik using equation 3 . The nip , polarization amplitude reflection coefficient rp can also be determined using equation 4.Note that at an angle of f 450, equation 4 yields 2 rp r and equation 5 cannot be used to determine 5 the s polarization phase shift EMI8.1 References 1.
