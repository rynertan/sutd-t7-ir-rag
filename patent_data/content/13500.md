## Description
REMOVING OIL F5e d of the Invention This invention rcAates to the removai of oil floating on a water surface. As will become apparcnt from the detailed description which follows, a principal use al thogh not necessarily the only usc for methods and apparatus i accordance with the present invention is in clcaring up oil spillage which has occurred on the surface of the sea, rivers, inland waterways, gravel pits, etc., particularly where rapid removal of an oil slick has t be accomplished in order to avoid pollution and eco3ospie damageBackground to the Invention In recent years with increasing interest and concern with environmental problems, numerous systems have been proposed for removing and collecting oil floating on water surfaces.Both mechanical and chemical systems have been suggested. A principal disadvantage which has become apparent on seeking to put the numerous prior paper proposals into practice has been their marked inability to work effectively in a rough sea. This is especially so in the case of suction devices, where wave motion results in the device ingesting large quantities of sea water along with the oil, rendering the rate of oil removal unsatisfactoril,. slow and also making subsequent processing of the collect oil more difficult.Description of the Invention In accordance with a first aspect thereof, the present invention provides apparatus for removing pollutant and the like floating on a water surface, comprising an endless belt, formed of expandible mesh material, and having oleophilic properties, which belt is provided with drive and support means adapted both to support and drive the belt in a first region at or immediately below the water surface to pick up pollutant oil and the like on the belt and to expand the mesh of the belt in a direction at rigs angles to the direction of movement thereof in a second region above the water level to thereby facilitate detacllJnont of pollutant oil nnd the like carried by the belt. In a second and altcrnative aspect of this invent on, there is provided a method of removing pollutant oil and the like floating on a water surface, the method comprising passing a belt formed of expandible mesh material, and having oleophilic properties, through said pollutant oil and the like with the mesh relatively closed to thereby pick up a portion of the pollutant oil and the like on the belt and expanding the mesh of the belt in a direction at right angles to its direction of movement at a position remote from the water to facilitate detachment of pollutant oil and the like carried by the belt. The term pollutant oil and the like is used herein to encompass one or more of oil, including heavy crude oil or heavier tarry constituents of oil, oil ater mousse, and other petroleum or liquid fuel based products liable to pollute bodies of water whether inadvertently or by illegal or antisocial design. The belt, which may be of a compbund construction including a number of components with different size mecs to thereby collect a broad range of oil droplet sizes, may be formed of a material which is itself oleophilicAlternatively, or additionally, the material of the mesk may be treated with a silicone coating which may be cured thereon. Pollutant oil and the like may be stripped fro the belt in the expanded mesh region by washing with water, which may be pre heated. The resulting washings consisting of an oil water mixture may be subjected to any suitable separation treatment applicable to such mixtures, such as by passing the mixture through a conventional plate separator and or a conventional coalescer system. Oil so separated may be passed to a storage tank and the water, containing only minor quant t of remaining oil, may be recirculated for further lias,is For use at sea, the apparatus is usefully mounts in and from a ship. Ti e invention is hereinafter more particularly described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Figure 9 illustrates one method of deploying apparatus constructed in accordance with the present invents on on a ship at sea. Figures 10 and 11 sho alternative methods of deploying the apparatus. Description of the Preferred Embodiments Figures 1 and 2 show an endless belt 1 formed expandible mesh material, and having oleophilic properties, supported on a series of pontoons 2 floating at or adjacent the surface of the sea 3, on a rising from the sea surface, and on a ship borne suppor. section 5. Drive 6 for the belt 1 is provided at the inboard side of section 5. The preferred construction for the belt is shown in Figure 3 in section. It will be seen that the belt of compound construction including a number of component layers 7 with various size mesh to thereby collect as will be explained below a broad range of oil droplet sizes. The layers 7 are sandwiched between outer laye of a heavy support mesh 8. The edges of the belt are formed by heat bonding and by inserting a series of eyelets 9. Also shown in section in Figure 3 is one guide box 10. A similar guide box would be provided for the other side of the belt. The guide boxes extend along the respective edges of the supports 2, 4 and 5.Within the guide boxes run respective drive chains 11 provided with upstanding pins 12 at sections therealong for coaction with the apertures defined by the eyelets 9The several pontoons 2 and the rising section 4 all have the same lateral width which is chosen so that the mesh is in a relatively unexpanded condition as shown inFigure 4 . The length to width ratio for respective mesh cells in this natural, unstressed condition may be of the order of 8 1. As is best shc in Figure 2, section 5 broadens out from its junc oa with the rising section 4 to its inboard end. Til as the belt tr avels along the section 5 towards the inboard end, the mesh is steadily expanded laterally by the drive chains 11 and pins 12 pulling the respective longitudinal edges of the mesh.In the fully open condition, each mesh cell may have a length to width ratio of approximately 1 1. The material of the expandible mesh is preferab itself oleophilic. A suitable material is polypropylene. F xp indibl e polypropylene mesh material is readily available for example from Netlon Limited. The mesh whether itself oleophilic or not is suitably though not necessarily if the material is itself oleophilic provided with an oleophilic coating. Thus the most preferred mesh is formed of polypropylene and is treated with a silicone coating which is cured thereon. Since the mesh material is olophilic, pollutant oil and the like floating in the surface regions of the sea 3 will tend to be attracted to the mesh, and will be picked up by the belt. Fine discrete droplets of oil will tend to adhere to the surface of the mesh material, as shown at 13 inFigure 5A. Motion of the belts themselves, aided by wave motion, will tend to move the individual droplets alQng the strands of mesh material, so increasing the chance of coalescence of these droplets 13 into larger droplets. The oleophilic nature of the mesh material together with surface tension effects will provide a bridging effect in the voids in the mesh cells so that somewhat larger droplets or larger quantities of oil will tend to adhere to the mesh as shown at 14 in Fig.SB. large lumps of oil or scmi solid oil water mousse will tend to be physically lifted out of the water by the moving belt as shown at 15 in Fig. 5C.As the process continues and the belt progresses from the sca on board the ship, coalescence between oil carried in any of the manners 13, 14 or 15 will tend to occur. By forming the belt with a compound construction as described bove with reference to Fig. 3, droplets of different sizes will find a mesh size best suited for retaining same, o that the effect of employing a compound belt is to increase the quantity of oil which will be picked up and also to ensure that the apparatus will work effectively over a broad range of conditions which might be found in ractice at sea. At all events, as described above, when the belt caches the support section 5, the mesh will be steadily expanded laterally to open the mesh cells. As will be appreciated, this facilitates detachment of oil carried by the belt. Indeed, drops such as that shown at 14 in Fig. 5B may simply fall through the space in the mesh into receiving tank 16. Water is suitably sprayed over support section 5 from a plurality of nozzles 17 to aid in physical detachment of oil droplets from the belt. Th water is suitably heated, for example by means of a heat exchanger ,8 which may derive heat from the steam heating system of the ship. The majority of small droplets 13 and drops 1 will tend either to fall through the spaces in the mesh to be stripped from the belt by the hot water spray. Lar lumps of semi solid oil uater mousse not so detached will tend to fall off the belt xvhen the belt starts its return run.The water washings, together with any oil ater lumps received in tank 16 are subjected to separation, the hot water already having broken up the large oil lumps to some extent. Anv suitable separator and or coalescer system rnay be unpi oyed, but that which we prefer is a corrugated p ate separator 19 of the type manufactured by us Such a separator allows oil containing a minor quantity of water only as little as, say, 5 water to be withdrawn from the tank by mcans of an oil skimmer 21. The water may be re used. The remaining water containin quantities of remaining oil only may be re used being p n. by means of a pump 22 from the bottom of the tank via an oil content monitor 23, which may be used to control the p mp, and thence to the heat exchanger 18. As the water cir culatory system is essentially closed, heating may be accomplished with a relatively low expenditure of energy. Since some sea water may be carried on board the vessel by the belt, an excess if water may tend gradually to accumulate in the system. Such excess water may be discharged to sea auttomatically from the system at a position between the oil content monitor and the heat exchanger, though in this case, the monitored oil content in the water must be sufficiently low to meet the oil discharge regulations.Oil content monitor 23 is employed to regulate the pump 22 such that the flow rate of water in the system is adjusted to achiee a satisfactorily low oil content in such efflux water irrespective of varying oil concentrations received in tank 1 Collection booms 24 suitably extend forwardly of the floating pontoons 2 as shown in Fig. 2, and an oil slick ma be channelled between the booms 24 and on to the belt by moving the ship appropriately. Since the pontoons float, they can follow vertically the wave profiles to a large extend. The system may also have a limited freedom to rotate about its centre line to aid in following the wave profiles. In a rough sea the pivoted pontoon sections map too readily follow the wave contours, the consequent substantial up and down motion tending to spoil the efficiency of oil collection to some extent. As is explained below with reference to Figs. 6 and 7, therefore, stabi Uing means a provided for some or all of the pontoon sections, so tendin to resist substantial up and down motions thereof, in a modified embodiment. If the distal pontoon section is set at a leading angle, the efficiellcy of oil collection tends to be improv and we therefore provide means for setting the leading angl of the distal pontoon section in the modification of Figs. 6 and 7. Additional angle setting means may be provided to maintain one or more other sections of the pontoon as clef. of the water surface as possible to avoid oil reentrainmon. Preferably the several angle setting means comprise hydro lanes or hydrofoil surfaces capable of being set at select angles, as woe explain below. The efficiency of the oil separation process as a whole can be optimized by the application of microprocessor techniques, and a suitable microprocessor control circuit such as is shown schematically in Fig. 8, and which provides programmed outputs for regulating the pump speed, the belt speed, the respective angles set by the angle setting means if provided , the control circuit taking its inputs from the several controlled means and also from the oil content monitor may also be employed. The preferred construction for the belt 1 and its manne of operation in the arrangement of Figs. 6, 7 and 8 is as described above with reference to Figs. 1 to 5. As will be seen from Fig. 7, fin ke is 101 are fitr to the underside of a pontoon section 2 alongside and dowa wardly of the belt 1 along its outward reach. The fins are shown extending at an angle of approximately 45 to the horizontal which has been found to be the most suitable The keels may consist of simple flat rectangular boards, they may be given a profile similar to that of the keel bb. of a boat. It has been found that when fin keels 101 as shown are fitted, the up and down motion of the pontoon sections in a rough sea is substantially attenuated. As will be clear from the schematic sectional view ofFig. 6, the distal pontoon section 102 is set at a leading angle into the sea. This is achieved by the provision cf angle setting means, here in the form of a par of hydro p ane or hydrofoil surfaces 103, similar to the diving p2i ... provided on a submarinc, extending outwardly at the side cdS of the leading end of the distal pontoon section. The pai of hydroplanes 103 is pivotable about an axis 104 so as to ary the angle defined by the hydroplane and hence the leading angle of the distal pontoon section into the sea.second pair of similar hydroplanes 105 are mounted at the prosimal end of the floating pontoon sections 2 adjacEnt t.leading edge of rising section 4. It will be noted that L te hydroplanes 105 are set at quite a different angle from th, hydroplanes 103. This is in order to keep other sections of the pontoon as clear of the water surface as possible to avoid oil reentrainment. The angles of the hydroplanes 103 and 105 are adjustable, either manually, or preferably, as will be explained below, through a microprocessor control circuit 106. As was explained in detail hereinabove with reference to Fig. 1, pollutant oil and the like i.e. oil and oil water mousse, etc. with or without additional water removed from the sea by the belt 1 is received in a receiving tank. The operation of the present embodiment is basically similar.Water is suitably sprayed over support section 5 from a plurality of nozzles 17 to aid in physical detachment of oil droplets from the belt. The water is suitable heated, for example by means of a heat exchanger 18 which may derive heat from a steam heating system of a ship. The water washings together with any oil water lumps received in the tank 16 are subjected to separation, the hot water already having broken up the large oil lumps to some extent. Any suitable separator and or coalescer system may be cmployed, but that preferred is a corrugated plate separator 19 of the type manufactured by Fram Europe Limited. Such a separator allows oil containing a minor quantity of water only as little as, say, 5 water to be withdrawn from the tank by means of an oil skimmer 21. The remaining water containing minor quantities of remaining oil only is reused being putnped by means of a pump 22 from.the bottom of the tank via an oil content monitor 23 to the eat exchanger 18. The water circulatory system is cssentially closed , and heating may be accomplished with a relatively low expenditure of energy, as before. Since som sea water may be carried on board the vessel by the belt, an excess of water may tend gradually to accumulate in the system. Such excess water may be discharged to sea auto atically from the system at a position between the oil intent monitor and the heat exchanger, though in this cases the monitored oil content in the water must be sufficiently low to meet the oil discharge regulations. The oil content as monitored by the monitor 23 forms sne input signal to a microprocessor control circuit 106 providing controlled outputs 107, 108 and 109 respectively for adjusting the belt speed drive 6, the speed of pump 22, and the angles of the respective hydroplanes 103 and 105. The efficiency of the oil removal and the oil water separating systems are affected by many variables, including, but not limited to, oil type and condition, sea temperature, oil slick thickness, mesh belt speed, vessel speed, wave motion, wash water temperature, was water flow, and wash pater contamination. All of these variables affect the efficiency of the removal and separation systems singular and in interaction with each other. In the arrangement of Figs. 6,.7 and 8 a micropvc. using conventional digital computing techniques is em,plc to simultaneously receive input data from a plurality of sensors indicative of the said effiency affecting variables and to process such data singularly and in interact on with each other in accordance with a pre set program to provide control signals to the various controllable components in response to any or all of the variable parameters to optimise the efficiency of the system over a wide range of operating conditions. The following sensors are utilised to provide input data to the microprocessor 1. Temperature sensors in the sea water and in the wash water . Capacit ance or resistance profiles placed immediately ahead of the distal pontoon section 102 to sense oil slick thickness 3. Tachometers attached to the mesh belt drive antf the wash water pump to provide belt speed and water flow data 4. Rotational sensors fitted to the hinge points between pontoon sections to provide data on wave height and period 5. A signal from the ship s log proportional to vessel speed through the water and 6. A signal from the oil content monitor 23 proportional to the amount of oil remaining in the wash water. Certain data is manually entered into the microprocessor at the start of a pollutant oil recovery operation. Such data includes a Oil type b Oil viscosity c Oil specific gravity d Length of time that oil has been in contact with water e Minimum and maximum temperatures that oil Water mixture has been exposed to since the sill f Oceanagraphic data and g Bulk density of sea water. From this manually entered data, the optimum separation characteristics, and the most probable oil droplet size distribution and the mousse condition can be computed. Static data manually entered and dynamic data from the various sensors is processed in accordance with the pre set program to provide control signals to controllable components, which may include a Angle setting means, such as the hydroplanes 103 and 105, for controlling the depth of the pontoon sectons b Belt drive motor 6 to optimise oil land on the belt c Hydraulic dampers at pontoon section binge points to provide optimum wave for owing characteristics by changing the lateral frequency and domping factors on the pontoon sections d Flow and temperature of the wash water to optimise separation efficiency and the breakdown of mousse and e A visual indication of optimum ship s speed to the bel msman. For example, the detection of a very thick slick of high specific gravity oil that had been in cold water for any days would signal the hydro vanes 103 to position the nose of the distal pontoon section 102 deet into the oil water interface and speed up the belt drive 6 to maximise the elt loading whilst signalling the ship to slow don if the oil slick thickness and condition indicated more oil than the belt could handle. The oil type and condition data manually entered would have computed the correct wash water temperature to optimise the mesh cleaning, oil separation and mousse breakdown capabilities. The data from the oil content monitor is used to fine tune ship speed, belt speed and water flow by conventional negative feed back techniques to maximise pick uprate by optimising separator efficiency. If the vessel is moving, turbulence will tend to be created at its stern. Figs. 9 and 10 show alternative ways in which apparatus constructed in accordance with the prnt invention may be deployed relative to a ship so as general to avoid the regions of turbulence at the stern of the vessel Thus, in Fig. 9, the apparatus is provided alongside the ship which progresses forwardly slowly into an oil slick, the prow of the vessel dividing the slick into separate regions bounded by collector booms 24 to channel the oil slick towards the respective belts of the two separator systems.A single separ ated oil storage tank 25 may be provided in the vessel. In the alternative arrangement of Fig. 10, two separator systems with respective collector booms 24 may be towed by means of long tow lines 26 behind the moving vessel. The two separator systems of Fig. 10 should be sufficiently separated from the stern of the vessel that the turbulence there created has largely dissipated before reaching the collector booms 24. It should be understood that the invention is nlt restricted to use on board a floating vessel travelling f . or indeed to use on board a vessel at all. The apparatus may be employed travelling rearwardly as schematically indicated in Fig. 11. Bysaitable adjustment of the belt drive 6 relative to the forward speed of the vessel, the belt speed relative to the sea surface can become zero providing maximum contact between belt and pollutant oil at the sea surface.
