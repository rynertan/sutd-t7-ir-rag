# Elastomeric composition.

## Abstract
A composition, extrudable or calenderable into a mem brane, comprising 100 parts by weight of a neutralized sulfo nated elastomeric polymer, 40 to 250 parts of a non polar process oil, 5 to 50 parts of a preferential plasticizer selected from the group consisting of a basic salt of a carboxylic acid and an organic amide and at least 65 parts of carbon black. The membrane, made in accordance with the composition of this invention, has particular application as a roof covering.
