# NITROGEN SUBSTITUTED ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS

## Abstract
There are described compounds of formula I, ZCHRCON R₄NH₅ CHR₆COOH I in which Z is R₂CH COOH NH or R₁SCH₂ , R₁ is hydrogen or R₈CO , R₆ is alkyl C1 to 10 or phenyl, R is hydrogen, alkyl C1 to 6, or alkyl C1 to 6 substituted by phenyl, NH₂, COOH or by alkyl C1 to 6 thio, R₂ is hydrogen, alkyl C1 to 10, cycloalkyl C3 to 10, phenyl, phenylalkyl C7 to 12, alkoxy C1 to 6 alkyl C1 to 6, alkyl C1 to 6 thioalkyl C1 to 6, phenyloxyalkyl C7 to 12 or phenylthioalkyl C7 to 12, R₄ and R₅, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen, alkyl C1 to 10, cycloalkyl C3 to 10, phenylalkyl C7 to 12, or phenyl the phenyl and phenylalkyl each optionally being substituted by one or more alkyl C1 to 6, alkoxy C1 to 6 or halogen groups, or R₄ and R₅ together form a CH₂ ₄ or CH₂ ₅ chain, and R₆ is hydrogen, alkyl C1 to 6 or phenylalkyl C7 to 12, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof. There are also described processes for making the compounds and their formulation and use as pharmaceutic als, eg. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
