# Epoxy maleate phosphate copolymers.

## Abstract
There is disclosed solution copolymers of monoethylen ically unsaturated monomers including a proportion of monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, with an oxi rane free epoxy acid ester phosphate having adducted onto the oxirane groups of a starting polyepoxide at least 10 thereof of ortho phosphoric acid as well as at least 0.5 by weight of a monoester of a saturated monohydric alcohol with a monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid which resists homopolymerization, the remaining oxirane groups of the polyepoxide being esterified with monocar boxylic acid, etherified with monoalcohol or hydrolyzed with water. These copolymers can be neutralized with a volatile amine, especially ammonia and cured with aminoplast or phenoplast resins to provide coatings which cure to greater flexibility and better resistance to blushing on pasteurization exposure.
