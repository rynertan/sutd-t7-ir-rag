# Ignition device.

## Abstract
An ignition device comprising a lower housing 1 in which a sleeve 2 is mounted containing the main charge 10 of the ignition device. The ignition device utilizes an electric igniter device 15 which includes an insulting body 19 , an electric pole device 20 and at least one electrically connecting element applied on one end surface 19a , of the insulating body for connecting the electric pole device 20 and the electric ignition device housing 21 . The electric ignition device makes contact via the said end surface 19a . against the layers 16 and 17 of pyrotechnical charges included in the ignition chain for the main charge 10 . The said electric ignition device and layers of pyrotechnical charges are located inside a ring shaped device 12 from the first end of which the electric pole device 20 protrudes. The ring shaped device extends into the recesses 1a and 9e in the lower housing 1 and the sealing part as well as across the space 13 between these parts. The sealing part 9 presses the pyrotechnical charges against the said end surface 19a and the electrically connecting elements via the filler layer 18 in the ring shaped device. The electric ignition device is fixed in and sealed against the ring shaped device which in turn is sealed against the lower housing by means of laser welding.
