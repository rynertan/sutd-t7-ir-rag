# Fabrication process for a dielectric isolated complementary ic.

## Abstract
In order to avoid the difficulty of mask alignment and patterning on a deep etched uneven surface of the substrate 11 , masking insulation layers 15, 16 are formed on the planar surface of the substrate before etching. The p type and n type islands 17, 18 are thereafter formed simul taneously by etching. The surface of the substrate is doped with a first impurity using the insulation layers as a mask and the portion of the layer 15 extending outside the layer 16 is etched off before doping the substrate with a second impurity whereby the surfaces of the islands are selectively doped 19,20 . Now, an insulation film 21 is formed on the substrate and a polysilicon layer 22 is grown. Then the substrate is lapped off from its back surface and removed, leaving island parts in the poly silicon layer 22 , which becomes a new substrate.
