# Tapping attachment and indexing mechanism therefor.

## Abstract
A tapping attachment includes a housing and a shaft, the shaft being associated with a source of rotational energy to cause forward or reverse drive of a tapping spindle which carries a tap which is intended to do work upon a workpiece. The shaft of the tapping attachment is provided with a collar having a recess therein. Associated with the housing is an indexing mechanism including a housing, a spring biased plunger insertable into the housing for limited movement therein, and a bracket arm operably associated with the plunger. The bracket arm includes a radially projecting extension insertable into the recess of the collar to fix the shaft in a desired position and also an axially extending arm engageable with a boss on a machining centre to fix the housings relative to the drive imparting machine and also to disengage the radial extension from the collar to permit rotation of the shaft and inner workings of the tapping attachment.
