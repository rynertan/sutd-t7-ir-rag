## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF HYDROCARBONS The invention relates to a process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture from a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen can be converted into aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures using a mixture of two catalysts, of which one has the capability of catalysing the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into acyclic oxygen containing hydrocarbons, and the other is a crystalline aluminium silicate having the capability of catalysing the conversion of acyclic oxygen containing hydrocarbons into aromatic hydrocarbons.The said crystalline aluminium silicates are characterized in that after one hour s calcining in air at 500 C they have the following properties a thermally stable up to a temperature of at least 6000C, b an X ray powder diffraction pattern showing the re flections given in Table A, and c in the formula which gives the composition of the silicate, expressed in moles of the oxides. the SiO2 A1203 molar ratio for sake of brevity further designated m in this patent application is higher than 10. Table A relative relative d intensity d A intensity 11.1 100 3.84 D 57 10.0 D 70 3.70 D 31 8.93 1 3.63 16 7.99 1 3.47 1 7.42 2 3.113 5 6.68 7 3.311 2 6.35 11 3.30 5 5.97 17 3.25 1 5.70 7 3.05 8 5.56 10 2.98 11 5.35 2 2.96 3 4.98 D 6 2.86 2 4.60 4 2.73 2 11.35 5 2.60 2 4.25 7 2.48 3 4.07 2 2.110 2 4.00 4 D doublet The expression thermally stable up to a temperature of at least t C, used in this patent application in con nection with crystalline silicates, means that if the silicate is heated up to a temperature of tOC the X ray powder diffraction pattern remains substantially unchanged. The crystalline silicates used in the catalyst mix tures are prepared from an aqueous starting mixture con taining the following compounds one or more compounds of an alkali metal M , a tetrapropylammonium compound, one or more silicon compounds and one or more aluminium compounds. The preparation of the crystalline silicates takes place by maintaining the mixture at elevated temperature until the silicate has formed, separating it from the mother liquor and calcining it. In the aqueous mixture from which the silicates are prepared, the various compounds should be present in the following ratios, expressed in moles of the oxides M20 SiO2 0.01 0.35, L C3H7 4N 2 SiO2 0.01 0.4,SiO2 Al203 10, and H20 SiO2 5 65. The Applicant has carried out an investigation concerning the use of the crystalline aluminium silicates prepared as described above as the catalyst component in the above mentioned catalyst mixtures to be employed in the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture from an H2 CO mixture. It was found in this investigation that the behaviour of these catalyst mixtures as regards their activity, stability, C5 selectivity and durene production is determined to a high degree by theSiO2 Al203 molar ratio m and the average crystallite size d of the crystalline aluminium silicate present in the catalyst mixture. The said durene production is especially important if the aim is to use the aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures prepared as gasoline.In view of the high melting point of durene it is desirable that its concentration in the aromatic hydrocarbon mixture be as low as possible. The investigation has shown these catalyst mixtures to have a high activity, stability and C5 selectivity and a low durene production, if the crystalline aluminium silicate present therein has an m between 200 and 750 and a d between 400 and 1500 nm. In view of the desired m value, the silicon and aluminium compounds should be present in the aqueous mixture from which the silicates are prepared in such a ratio, expressed in moles of the oxides, that the requirement SiO2 Al203 150 1500 is satisfied. The present patent application therefore relates to a process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture in which an H2 CO mixture is contacted with a mixture of two catalysts of which one catalyst X has the capability of catalysing the conversion of anH2 CO mixture into acyclic oxygen containing hydrocarbons and the other catalyst Y is a crystalline aluminium silicate which, after one hour s calcining in air at 500 C, has the following properties a thermally stable up to a temperature of at least 6000C, b an X ray powder diffraction pattern showing the reflec tions given in Table A, c an m value between 200 and 750, and d a d value between 400 and 1500 nm, which crystalline aluminium silicate has been prepared by maintaining an aqueous mixture containing the following compounds one or more compounds of an alkali metal M , a tetrapropylammonium compound, one or more silicon compounds and one or more aluminium compounds, in which mixture the compounds are present in the fol lowing ratios, expressed in moles of the oxides M20 SiO2 0.01 0.35, p C3H7 4N32G SiO2 0.01 0.4, SiO2 A1203 150 1500, and H20 SiO2 5 65, at elevated temperature until the crystalline silicate has been formed and subsequently separating this from the mother liquor and calcining it. In the process according to the invention the starting material is an H2 CO mixture. Such a mixture can very suitably be prepared by steam gasification of a carbon containing material. Examples of such materials are brown coal, anthracite, coke, crude mineral oil and fractions therefrom, and oils produced from tar sand and bituminous shale. The steam gasification is preferably carried out at a temperature between 900 and 15006C and a pressure between 10 and 50 bar. The preferred starting material in the process according to the invention is an H2 CO mixture whose molar ratio lies between 0.25 and 1.0. The process according to the invention is preferably carried out at a temperature of 200 500 C and in particular of 300 4500C, a pressure of 1 150 bar and in particular of 5 100 bar and a space velocity of 50 5000 and in particular of 300 3000 Nl gas l catalyst h. In the process according to the invention a mixture of two catalysts is used, which for convenience are designated catalyst X and catalyst Y. Catalyst X is the one which is capable of catalysing the conversion of anH2 CO mixture into acyclic oxygen containing hydrocarbons and catalyst Y is the crystalline aluminium silicate. It is preferred to use catalyst mixtures containing per part by weight of catalyst Y, 2.5 12.5 parts by weights of catalyst X.Catalysts that are preferably used as X catalysts are those which are capable of converting an H2 CO mixture into substantially methanol and or dimethylether. Very suitable for the present purpose are catalysts containing zinc together with chromium. When using such a catalyst, it is preferred to choose one in which the atomic percentage of zinc, based on the sum of zinc and chromium, is at least 60 and in particular 60 802. Catalyst mixtures in which a catalyst X is present which contains zinc together with chromium and in which the atomic percentage of zinc, based on the sum of zinc and chromium, is between 60 and 80 , show a very high activity, when they contain per part by weight of catalyst Y, 4 8 parts by weight of such a catalyst X. In the preparation of the aluminium silicates that are used in the process according to the invention the silicon compound is preferably amorphous silica and the aluminium compound is preferably NaAlO2 or amorphous alumina. The m value can be controlled by means of the molar ratio of SiO2 and Al203 in the starting mixture, in the sense that silicates with a higher m value are obtained according as the molar ratio of SiO2 to Al203 in the starting mixture is chosen higher. The d value can be controlled by means of the molar ratio of C3H7 112O to Si02 in the starting mixture, in the sense that silicates with a lower d value are obtained according as the molar ratio of C3H7 11NJ20 to SiO2 in the starting mixture is chosen higher. The aluminium silicates that are used in the process according to the invention are prepared from an aqueous mixture containing one or more alkali metal compounds.The preferred alkali metal compound in the preparation of the aluminium silicates is a sodium compound. The alkali metal ions present in the aqueous mixture from which the aluminium silicates are prepared find their way at least partly in the silicates prepared . With the aid of suitable exchange methods they can be replaced by other cations such as hydrogen ions or ammonium ions.The aluminium silicates used in the catalyst mixtures preferably have an alkali metal content of less than 0.1 w and in particular less than 0.05 fiw. If desired, a binder material such as bentonite or kaolin may be incorporated into the catalyst mixtures. The process according to the invention can very suitably be carried out by conducting the feed in upward or downward direction through a vertically mounted reactor in which a fixed or a moving bed of the catalyst mixture concerned is present. The process according to the invention can also very suitably be used as the first step of a two step process for the conversion of H2 CO mixtures into hydrocarbon mixtures. In this case carbon monoxide and hydrogen present in the reaction product of the first step are, if desired together with other components of this reaction product, contacted in a second step with a catalyst containing one or more metal components with catalytic activity for the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into acyclic hydrocarbons, which metal components have been chosen from the group formed by cobalt, nickel and ruthenium, on the understanding that if the feed for the second step has an H2 CO molar ratio of less than 1.5, water is added to this feed and that in the second step a bifunctional catalyst or catalyst combination is used which, in addition to the metal components with catalytic activity for the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into acyclic hydrocarbons, also contains one or more metal components with catalytic activity for the conversion of an H2O CO mixture into an H2 C02 mixture. Further, the process according to the invention can very suitably be used as the first step of a three step process for the preparation of, inter alia, middle distillates from an H2 CO mixture. In this case carbon monoxide and hydrogen present in the reaction product of the first step, if desired together with other components of this reaction product, are contacted in a second step with a catalyst that contains 10 40 pbw cobalt and 0.25 5 pbw zirconium, titanium or chromium per 100 pbw silica and which has been prepared by impregnating a silica carrier with one or more aqueous solutions of salts of cobalt and zirconium, titanium or chromium, followed by drying the composition, calcining at 350 700 0C and reducing at 200 35O0C, on the understanding that if the feed for the second step has an H2 CO molar ratio of less than 1.5, water is added to the feed and that the cobalt impregnation catalyst is used in combination with aCO shift catalyst. Of the reaction product of the second step at least the part whose initial boiling point lies above the final boiling point of the heaviest middle distillate desired as the end product, is subjected in a third step to a catalytic hydrotreatment. The invention will now be explained with reference to the following example.Example Thirteen crystalline aluminium silicates silicates 1 13 were prepared by heating mixtures of NaOH, C3H7 4NOH, amorphous silica containing 300 ppmw Al and NaAlO2 for 24 hours at 150 C in water in an autoclave under autogenous pressure, either with stirring or not.Further, two crystalline aluminium silicates silicates 14 and 15 were prepared, substantially in the same way as the silicates 1 13, the differences being that in the preparation of silicate 14 use was made of amorphous alumina instead of NaAlO2 and that in the preparation of silicate 15 use was made of C4HgNH2 instead of C3H7 4NOH. Finally, a crystalline silicate silicate 16 was prepared, substantially in the same way as the silicates 1 13, the difference being that in the preparation of silicate 16 no use was made of NaAlO2.After the reaction mixtures had cooled down, the silicates formed were filtered off, washed with water until the pH of the wash water was about 8, dried at 1200C and calcined at 500 C.

Of the experiments listed in Table D only the experiments 1 4 and 11 15 are experiments according to the invention. In these experiments use was made of catalyst mixtures containing silicates with an m between 200 and 750 and a d between 400 and 1500 nm, which silicates had been prepared using a tetrapropylammonium compound. These catalyst mixtures all showed a high activity, stability and C5 selectivity and a low durene production.The experiments 5 10 and 16 18 are outside the scope of the invention. They have been included in this patent application for comparison. In the experiments 5, 6, 8, and 16 use was made of catalyst mixtures containing silicates with a d 4400 nm.These catalyst mixtures showed too high a durene production. In experiment 7 use was made of a catalyst mixture containing a silicate with a d 1500 nm. The stability of this catalyst mixture was too low. In experiment 9 use was made of a catalyst mixture containing a siliilicate with an m 200. This catalyst mixture showed too low a stability and too low a C5 selectivity. In experiment 10 use was made of a catalyst mixture containing a silicate with an m 200 and a d 400 nm. TheC5 selectivity of this catalyst mixture was too low. In experiment 17 use was made of a catalyst mixture whose silicate component had been prepared using an amine instead of a tetrapropylammonium compound. This catalyst mixture showed too low a stability. In experiment 18 use was made of a catalyst mixture with an m 750 and a d 400 nm. The activity of this catalyst mixture was too low. The only difference between the catalyst mixturesM, N and 0 is the weight ratio in which the ZnO Cr203 composition and the silicate are present therein. The results of the experiments 13, 14 and 15 show that the activity of catalyst mixture N in which this ratio is 5, is higher than the activities of the catalyst mixturesM and 0 in which this ratio is 10 and 3.5, respectively.
