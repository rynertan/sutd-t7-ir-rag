# OPTICAL FIBER

## Abstract
An optical fiber having a first covering 2 surrounding the optical fiber 1 and a second covering 3 surrounding the first covering, the first covering comprising a material, the Young s modulus of which at 30 C is not greater than ten times that at 23 C, which has small increase of attenuation of light transmission at a low temperature and also small increase of attenuation of light transmission due to lateral pressure not only at a room temperature but also at a low temperature.
