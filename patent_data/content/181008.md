# Power supply for deflection circuit.

## Abstract
A power supply circuit 400 for an output stage portion of a magnetic deflection circuit amplifier is disclosed. It comprises a power supply means for supplying a supply voltage during the collapse of the magnetic field associated with the yoke following the retrace portion. The power supply means also restores energy to another power supply means to which it is coupled, the other power supply means providing a supply voltage to the amplifier during a portion of the raster scan just preceding the retrace.
