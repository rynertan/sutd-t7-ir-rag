# Roller assembly with roller retention mechanism.

## Abstract
A roller retention mechanism for a roller bearing includes at least three portions 26 each extending into contact with two adjoining rollers 14 . The rollers are wedged appart circumferentially. The keystoning effect presses all the rollers against the wall of the bore 12 in the roller assembly with sufficient force to prevent axial move ment of the rollers and to radially retain the rollers in assembly. The roller retention mechanism is constructed and arranged to be subsequently pushed axially from the roller assembly.

## Claims

## Description
bb ORIPTIC ROLLERS ASSEMBLY ROLLER RETENTION MECHANISM This invention relates to holler bearings. More particularly, this invention is a novel roller bearing with a novel roller retention mechanism. For many years full complements of loose rollers have been shipped in bodies with cylindrical bores, such as bearing outer race rings. To keep the rollers in place in the races radially, grease or some land of tube or cylinder, inside the circle of rollers has been used.Usually the outer race includes flanges to keep the rollers axially in place during shipment. However, often it is desired to ship the complement of loose rollers in an outer race which has a bore of the same diameter throughout its length, that is, it has no end flanges.In this situation, the problem of retaining the loose rollers in the race is compounded. It is not practical to consider grease with its slight retention especially in hot climates and if a tube is used, it is necessary to employ an interference fit sufficient to assure that all rollers are forced against the outer race strongly enough so that the roller to race friction prevents axial movement of the rollers. This means that the tube outside diameter has to be larger than the maximum shaft diameter by an amount greater than the diametrical clearance that can occur in the roller and outer race assembly.This often causes problems when inserting the tube within the circle of rollers and when pushing the oversize tube out through a port or bore in the associated mechanism which may result in leaving shreds of the tube material in the bearing of the rlecnalzism in which it is used. In U.S. Patent No 4,165,660, roller retention mechanisms are described for exerting a keystoning effect on the rollers to prevent axial movement of the rollers and to retain the rollers in the roller assembly. The roller retention mechanism specifically described in sSlch patent are made of a metal or of a synthetic plastic resin. The retention mechanism such as retention springs are inserted by hand during production. The retaining springs include two diametrically opposed portions each of which wedgebetween two adjoining rollers. often, in production, the retaining springs inserted by hand are not exactly positioned to contact the rollers at diametrically opposed points, causing uneven loading and poor roller retention. his, of course, is undesirable. A roller assembly according to the present invention comprises a body with a cylindrical bore rollers extending lengthwise inside the bore and disposed along side and abutting one another in the bore so as to form a substantially closed circle of rollers and a roller retention member having portions each extending into contact with the converging arcs of two adjoining roller surfaces and adapted to push these rollers apart circumferentially to keystone all the rollers and thus to press all the rollers against the wall of the.bore with sufficient force to prevent axial movement of the rollers and to retain the rollers in the body, characterized in that the roller retention member has at least three axially extending portions which are circumferentially spaced apart and are each adapted to contact a respective two rollers to push these apart. The roller retention member or mechanism may be removed from the body after shipment, preferably by a simple axial push. The invention will be further described, by way of example, with reference to the drawings, in which Big. 1 is.a top view of one preferred embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a view to wren along lines 2 2 of Fig. 1 and in the direction of the arrows Sig. 3 is a perspective view of the roller retention mechanism included in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a perspective view of another preferred embodiment of a roller retention mechanism Fig. 5 is a top view of a roller assembly including the roller retention mechanism of Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 is a view taken along lines 6 6 of Fig. 5 and in the direction of the arrows. Referring to the drawings, and more particularly toFig. 1 and Fig. 2, the roller assembly includes a casing or body 10. A bore 12 extends through the body 10. The bore 12 has the same diameter throughout its length and the body 10 has no flanges. However, if desired, one or more flanges may be provided at either or both ends of the body 10. Rollers 14 extend lengthwise within the bore 12 and are in contact with the surface of the bore 12. The rollers 14 abut one another and form a substantially closed circle of rollers. A roller retention mechanism is shown inserted into the bore 12. The roller retention mechanism may be made from a spring or from plastics or flat stock string material. It includes a first end rim 20 see Fig. 3 and a second end rim 22. Three axially extending, interconnecting spring members 24 interconnect end rims 20 and 22. The spring members 24 are circumferentially spaced, and in the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 3, the interconnecting spring members are circumferentially equally spaced and intended for numbers of rollers capable of being divided into three equal grounds. This spacing may be altered to accoemodate non equal groups of rollers. Each interconnecting spring 24 has a central outwardly extending or bulging portion 26. When the spring is inserted into the bore 12, the bulging portions 26 of springs 24 extend into contact with the converging arcs of two adjoining roller surfaces 14. Thus, bulging portions 26 push the rollers 14 apart circumferentially to kes one all of the rollers and press all of. the rollers against the wall of the bore 12. The force is sufficient to prevent axial movement of the rollers 44 and to retain the rollers in the body 10. The spring may be easily removed from the body 10 and the circle of rollers by the axial push of an appropriate tool while the rollerstheeselves are restrained by other means. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 4 to 6, the roller retention mechanism is formed from a wire. Referring toFig. 4, the wire is shaped so as to have at least three circumferentially separated, axially extending portions 30, 32 and 34. The entire spring is made of one part and includes a portion 36 leading from one end of axially extending portion 34 to one end of axially extending portion 30, and an interconnecting portion 38 leading from the other end of axially extending portion 30 to one end of axially extending portion 32. The free ends of axially extending portions 32 and 34 are hooked at 40 and 42, respectively, to facilitate the removal of the spring from body 10 and the circle of rollers. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, when the spring of Fig. 4 is inserted in the bore 12 of body 10, the axially extending portions 30, 32 and 34 each extend into contact with the converging arcs of two adjoining rollers 14 at circumferentially separated points in the body 10. Ls in the embodiment of Figs. 1 to 3, the wedging effect is such as to keystone all the rollers to prevent axial movement of the rollers and to retain the rollers in the body 10. Also, as in the case of the embodiment ofFigs. 1 to 3, the spring of the embodiment of Figs. 4 to 6 may be easily removed axially by the axial push of an appropriate tool while the rollers are restrained. The retainer is extremely cheap and disposable. It is made for a single use application and is discarded when removed from the roller assembly, although it could be re used, if desired. There is no collection for shipment back to the bearing company, no requirement of careful handling, and no concern about sharp burrs and edges raised on the springs to do damage during previous use and handling, which burrs and edges might harm bearing components or the mechanism if the springs were re used. Each of. the preferred embodiments shown include three portions each adapted to extend into a space between two adjacent rollers. However, if desired, more than three axially extending portions on the roller retention mechanism may be provided.
