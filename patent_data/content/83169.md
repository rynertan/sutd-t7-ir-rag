## Description
FILTER APPARATUS HAVING SECONDARY GAS DISCHARGE SYSTEM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to gas separation devices and in particular to a filter apparatus having a reverse flow flushing arrangement for periodically cleaning the filter media in the apparatus.Description of the Prior Art The prior art discloses a variety of separating devices utilizing reverse flow flushing arrangements for cleaning the filter media provided in those devices. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,272,262 shows a high efficiency filtering device wherein a plurality of venturi nozzles are axially aligned in pairs above aV shaped bank of filter panels which enables its clean gas compartments to be periodically pressurized to create a reverse flow of gases through the filter bank to dislodge particulates accumulating on the filter panels during filtering operations. As brought out in the foregoing patent, various baghouse arrangements having reverse flow flushing systems have also been in use for a number of years. Typically, in that type of design a plurality of filter bags are suspended in the gas cleaning compartment of the baghouse for filtering the dirty gases as they flow through the baghouse.However, because of the size and number of filter bags which are required to provide a filter area comparable to that provided by the filter panels in the foregoing patent, such baghouse installations are necessarily relatively large and bulky and thus are generally used only where space and mobility are a secondary consideration. While the various separating devices heretofore in use have proven to be satisfactory for many applications, pressure losses due to uneven flow of the gas stream through the filters as well as re entrapment of the particu lates in the filters after they have been dislodged during reverse flow flushing operations have continued to be a problem. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a gas separation device and in particular to a filter apparatus having a secondary gas discharge system for removing particulates from the face of the filter media during reverse gas flushing operations and for promoting a uniform flow of the gas stream through the media during filtering operations. The filter apparatus embodying the invention includes a housing wherein a filter panel is secured in flow through relation across its interior to provide a filter barrier for removing particulates in the gas stream flowing through the housing. In order to promote a more uniform flow of the gas stream through the filter panel, as well as to evacuate particulates dislodged from the panel during reverse flushing operations, the secondary gas discharge system is adapted to draw a predetermined portion of the dirty gases entering the housing across the face of the filter panel through a slot or opening extending along one edge of the filter panel.The invention also provides for a plate like baffle secured across the width of the filter panel in the dirty gas chamber of the apparatus to form a filter cleaning zone of a tapered cross sectional configuration converging at the slot opening into the secondary gas discharge system. This arrangement promotes even greater uniformity in the flow of the gas stream across the entire area of the filter media in the filter panel. From the foregoing, it can be seen that the invention contemplates a filter apparatus which significantly improves the efficiency and service life of the filter media in the apparatus. However, it is to be understood that various changes and modifications can be made in the apparatus disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a side elevational view, partially in section, showing a filter apparatus embodying the invention Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken substantially along line II II in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view taken substantially along line III III in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view taken substantially along line IV IV in Fig. 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to Fig. 1, the filter apparatus 1 embodying the invention is particularly suited for filtering atmospheric air as it is drawn into the air inlet of a turbine or compressor. The filter apparatus 1 includes a housing 2 wherein an apertured plate or partition 3 is secured across the housing 2 to divide it into a dirty gas chamber 4 opening into the atmosphere through an opening 5 in the bottom of the housing and a clean gas plenum 6 provided with a clean gas outlet 7 which is connected to the air inlet of the turbine or compressor.As shown in the drawings, a plurality of filter supporting structures or frames 8 of a V shaped cross sectional con figuration enclosed by a plate 9 on each end are secured to the partition 3 in side by side relation. Each of the frames 8 supports a plurality of pleated filter panels 10 similar to those sold by the American Air Filter. Company under its Pulse Clean trademark to form a V shaped bank of filter panels 10 within each of the frames 8 which cooper ates with the partition 3 to define a clean gas compartment 11 opening into the clean gas plenum 6 through apertures 12. Thus, the arrangement provides for atmospheric air to be drawn into the dirty gas chamber 4 through the opening 5 in the bottom of. the housing whereafter it filters through the filter panels 10 into the clean gas co npartmPnts 11. The filtered air then flows through the apertures 12 into the clean gas plenum 6 and out of tlze housing through tne clean gas outlet 7. In this regard, it is to be understood that although the embodiment shown in the drawings is designed to filter atmospheric air prior to introducing it into a turbine or compressor, the filter apparatus can also be used to filter industrial process gases prior to discharging them to the atmosphere by enclosing the bottom of the housing with a suitable hopper and providing an appropriate inlet for the dirty gases opening into the dirty gas chamber.Additionally, while it is not described in detail in this specification, the filter apparatus 1 is preferably of a welded sheet metal construction wherein the filter panels 10 can be removably secured in the frames 8 in essentially the same manner as shown in U.S. Patent No.4,272,262. To accommodate periodic cleaning of the filter panels 10, the filter apparatus 1 is provided with a reverse gas flushing system 13 such as that shown in the latter patent. As shown in Fig. 1, the flushing system 13 includes a first venturi nozzle 14 secured to the partition 3 about each of the apertures 12 in the clean gas system 6, a second venturi nozzle 15 secured in coaxially spaced relation to each of the first venturi nozzles 14, and a gas header or supply pipe 16 connected to a source of pressurized gas not shown . The supply pipe 16 is provided with a gas nozzle 17 aligned above each of the venturi nozzles 14 and 15 which is adapted to periodically direct a high energy jet or pulse of clean air through the venturi nozzles which aspirates a flow of the filtered air in the gas plenum 6 through the venturi nozzles into the clean gas compartments 11. This creates a reverse flow of the filtered air through the filter panels 10 to dislodge the particulates which in turn drop out of the dirty gas chamber 4 through the opening 5 in the bottom of the housing. Again referring to the drawings, the invention provides that the filter apparatus 1 includes a secondary gas discharge system 20 for removing particulates accumu lating on the surface of the filter panels 10 during reverse gas flushing of the panels, as well as promoting a relatively uniform air flow through each of the filter panels. As shown inFig. 1, a slot or secondary opening 21 is provided in the partition 3 extending along each side of the frames 9 which opens into a discharge duct 22 connected to a common header duct 23 which is connected to a draft inducing device in the form of a blower 24 adapted to draw a predetermined portion of the unfiltered air in the dirty gas chamber 4 across the faces of the filter panels 10.The size or capacity of the blower 24 is selected so that about 5 10 percent of the total flow of air entering the dirty gas chamber 4 will be drawn across the filter panels 10 and conducted out of the housing 2 through the ducts 22 and 23. Thereafter, depending on what the filter apparatus is being used for, those gases may be discharged directly into the atmosphere, or alternatively, directed into a secondary filtering apparatus not shown such as that disclosed in U.S PatentNo. 4,264,345 wherein the gases are cleaned prior to discharging them into the atmosphere. For example, in applications where the filter apparatus is used to clean air entering the intake of a turbine or compressor, those gases would generally be discharged directly into the atmosphere.On the otherhand, where the filter apparatus is used to remove pollutants from industrial process gases or the like, the gases drawn into the secondary gas discharge system would be circulated through a secondary filtering apparatus prior to discharging them to the atmosphere. As noted above, during normal filtering operations the blower 24 maintains a draft across the faces of the filter panels 10 which serves to promote a uniform flow of air through the filter panels 10. However, in order to further enhance this flow distributing feature of the invention, a baffle plate 25 is secured to the partition 3 with suitable brackets 26 between each of the frames 8. more over, each of the baffle plates 25 serves to prevent particulates which are dislodged from one of the filter panels 10 during pulsing of its respective clean gas compartment 11 from being deposited on the filter panel opposite it on the frame 8 adjacent to it in those arrangements where each of the clean gas compartments 11 are pulsed sequentially during fiter cleaning operations.Each of the baffle plates 25 is sized to extend generally coextensively with its adjacent filter panel 10 and cooperates with the filter panels to form a tapered filter cleaning zone 27 extending along the length of each of the panels and converging at its respective slot 21 opening into the duct 22 of the gas discharge system This arrangement facilitates sizing the frames 8 to position the filter panels at an angle which gradually reduces the crosssectional area of the cleaning zones in proportion to the air flow along the length of each of the filter panels, thereby maintaining the velocity of the air stream flowing along the filter panel. This in turn results in a relatively uniform flow of air through the entire surface of the filter.In this regard, it should be noted that in some installations the shape of the frame 8 and the baffle plates 25 will be sufficient to maintain an essentially uniform air flow through the filter panels 10. In those cases, the blower 24 would be turned off during normal filtering operations and the gas discharge system only used to remove particulates accumulating on the face of the filter panels during reverse gas flushing of the panels. The invention also contemplates aligning the pleated filter panels 10 in each of the frames 8 to promote inertial separation of the particulates from the air stream as it enters the filter panels. As shown in the drawings, the pleats 28 in the pleated filter media of each of the filter panels 10 are aligned perpendicularly to the flow of the air stream as it enters the panels. Thus, since the gas discharge system maintains a draft in the filter cleaning zones 27 which maintains the momentum of the particulates along the face of each of the filter panels, the pleats 28 tend to effect inertial separation of the particulates from the air as it flows into the filter panels.
