# Apparatus and method for spiral separation of materials.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method are disclosed for spiral separation of materials. The apparatus includes spiral separator flights mounted on a vertical tube 22 within an enclosure with the material, such as seeds, to be separated being introduced into the apparatus through the vertical tube upon which the spirals are mounted. One of the separated material fractions is discharged from the apparatus through the vertical tube while the other fraction is discharged from a second discharge outlet. A spiral driving mechanism 42 and a baffle 44 are provided for separator adjustability and a plurality of spirals may be enclosed within a common housing. The method includes separating materials by introducing the materials onto spirals at a separating area, controlling the speed of rotation of the spirals to control separation, and collecting the separated fractions
