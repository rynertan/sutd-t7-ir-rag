# Selective anti reverse mechanism for fishing reel.

## Abstract
A spin casting style fishing reel is provided with an anti reverse mechanism which prevents the crank assembly from being rotated in a reverse direction wherein fishing line is payed out, when a selection switch for the mechanism is set in a first position. The selection switch can be selectively moved between the first position and a second position for activation and deactivation of the anti reverse mechanism. A lever por tion of the anti reverse mechanism has an integral activation arm which follows the movement of the selection switch be tween the first and second positions, activating and deactiva ting the anti reverse mechanism, and a bias receiving arm to which a spring is mounted to hold the activation arm in enga gement with the selection switch.
