# Radiation polymerizable composition for forming heat resistant relief structures on electrical devices such as semiconductors and capacitors.

## Abstract
A polyamide ester resin containing photopolymerizable groups is made more rapidly photopolymerizable and there fore more suitable for forming relief structures on electrical devices such as capacitors, integrated circuits and semicon ductors by including therein a radiation sensitive polymeriz able polyfunctional acrylate compound and an aromatic biimidazole photopolymerization initiator. On exposure through a pattern of a dried film obtained using a solution of such composition, photopolymerization takes place rapidly and efficiently following which developing can be effected and the photopolymerized material baked to leave a heat resistant polyimide structure.
