# Method of reconditioning welded joints.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a combined method of welding and annealing an aluminum zinc alloy coated ferrous wire, and restoring the corrosion resistant properties to the annealed areas of said wire. More particularly this invention is directed to reconditioning weld joints in aluminum zinc alloy coated ferrous wire, where the coating consists of an aluminum zinc alloy overlay and an intermetallic alloy layer, said intermetallic alloy layer being between said alloy overlay and the ferrous wire. The preferred method includes the steps of 1 upset welding two aligned aluminum zinc alloy coated steel wires, 2 annealing the weld joint, such as by electric resistant heating, at a temperature of between about 1200 and about 1450 F 649 and 788 C , whereby during such annealing the weld joint is subjected to brushing to remove said alloy overlay and to prevent the formation of oxides on said intermetallic alloy layer, 3 removing the burr formed during such welding, and 4 cooling. During said cooling, or alternatively by reheating to a maximum temper ature where the aluminum zinc alloy coating on the wire begins to melt, i.e. about 900 F 482 C , a lead free, Zn containing solder stick or wire is repeatedly moved along the weld joint to further disrupt and remove any oxide remaining thereon while depositing a new corrosion resistant coating comprised of said lead free, Zn containing solder. The resulting wire, having a corrosion resistant metallic coating along the weld area, may be bent tightly around a mandrel without the coating flaking off the wire.
