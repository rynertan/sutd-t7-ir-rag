# PROTECTIVE CLOTHING

## Abstract
A suit of protective clothing has a ring at each sleeve end within which a frusto conical gauntlet lining of the glove makes a seal enhanced by outward pressure on the glove. The glove end portion and or that of an inner sleeve extend ing from the ring can be turned around the ling end and sealed by a frusto conical portion of an inner glove. A breathing mask can be likewise sealed against a sealing ring around an aperture in the suit, or an integral visor, provided with spaced outer and inner anti misting panels between which pressure air may be caused to flow, can be provided. The trouser legs have external tubes which fold up within themselves to the tops of boots within which the legs are received.
