# FREQUENCY CHECK APPARATUS

## Abstract
A frequency check apparatus, for example, for a GO NO GO control function in a chopper controlled traction motor control system is required to permit operation at only the correct chopper frequency and also normal start up from rest when the chopper frequency is zero. A conventional band pass filter type frequency sensing channel 2 discriminates between operation at correct and incorrect frequencies but cannot respond in the required manner to zero frequency. To permit zero frequency detection a signal generator 11 is coupled to a second and appropriately responsive channel 3 via a saturable magnetic circuit 13 which is also coupled to the frequency carrying conductor 4 . At any operating frequency the magnetic circuit 13 is saturated and the second channel 3 is blocked so that the control function is provided by the first channel 2 . At zero operating fre quency the signal generator 11 is not blocked and while the first channel 2 is not energised the control function is pro vided by the second channel 3 . The outputs of the first and second channels are connected via an OR gate 1 .
