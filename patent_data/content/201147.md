## Abstract
An apparatus for pumping a fluid, said apparatus com prising substantially a housing 1 with two or more parallel cyclindrical pump chambers 2 in each of which a piston 10 is reciprocally moveable, said piston 10 is connected via a piston rod 13 to a rocker piece 21 mounted on a driving shaft 22 parallel to the cylinders and rotatably jour nalled in the housing, wherein the piston rod 13 is con nected at one end fixedly to the piston 10 and at the other end movably to the rocker piece 21 , the piston rod 13 be ing at the piston end tiltable around a transverse axis with respect to the housing 1 , and wherein a bush 15 of a hard material such as ceramic material is fitted around the piston 10 , said bush cooperating with one or more sealing means 16, 17 , in order to avoid wear at the usual joints between the piston rod 13 and piston 10 and leakage over the sealing 16, 17 between the compression and drive side re spectively.
