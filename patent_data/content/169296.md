# Drive mechanism.

## Abstract
A drive mechanism 10 , comprises a support 12 , upon which a drive member 18 , is mounted for movement relative to a frame 15 . The drive member of which may be mounted on the other. The elements are interconnected by a resilient member 34, 35 , which transmits the drive there through, a drive input 17 , being coupled to a one element, a drive output 40 , to the other element. A detector 64 , generates a signal output responsive to relative movement of the elements 20, 24 which may serve to control a drive transmitted through the mechanism. In a preferred embodi ment, the support is a rotatable screwed shaft 16 , and the first element 20 , a traveller thereon upon which the second element 24 , is slidably mounted, the elements being interconnected by helical springs 34, 35 .
