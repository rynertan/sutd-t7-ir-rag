# SYNTHETIC DNA AND PROCESS THEREFOR

## Abstract
A DNA molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence substantially corresponding to all or a portion of foot and mouth disease virus RNA and in particular coding for at least one protein of foot and mouth disease virus. The DNA molecule can be inserted into a DNA cloning vehicle capable of expressing the DNA molecule, after a suitable host cell has been transformed by the cloning venicle. The expression product can be incorporated into a vaccine for stimulating antibodies against FMDV. Methods for producing the DNA molecule, recombinant cloning vehicle and transformed host cell are described.
