# Insulation deterioration monitoring apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus for monitoring an insulation deterioration of an insulation layer 2 surrounding an outer surface of a coil conductor comprises a semiconductor layer 3 of 10² to 10⁷ ohm cm formed within the insulation layer of the coil, an electric field sensor such as Pockels 6 element or ferroelec tric element mounted on the coil insulation layer 2 . The semiconductor layer 3 is so formed as to divide the insulation layer into inner and outer layers. When the inner layer deteriorates, a high electric field is sensed, while the outer layer deteriorates, a low electric field is sensed. Therefore, it is possible to discriminate the insulation deterioration positions on the basis of the change in electric field detected by the sensor element. In case of deterioration, alarms are produced or the power supply of machine is turned off for safety.
