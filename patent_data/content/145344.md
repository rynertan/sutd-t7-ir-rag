# Optical memory disc.

## Abstract
An disc 15 includes a glass substrate on which a plurality of concentric circular guide grooves or a spiral groove are formed for the tracking purpuses. A centering plate 13 is secured to the glass substrate 10 in a manner that the center of a circular opening formed in the centering plate is exactly adjusted to the center of the plurality of concentric circular guide grooves spiral groove . The cir cular opening 13a formed in the centering plate is utilized to drive the optical memory disc on a turntable 14 . Since the circular opening is not formed directly in the glass substrate, the center adjustment is easily conducted, and there is no possibility that the glass substrate is damaged when the circular opening is formed.
