# Drive axle fluid system.

## Abstract
A combined lubrication and brake actuating fluid system for a drive axle, separate from the transmission hydraulic sys tem of the vehicle, utilizes the differential housing 32 as a res ervoir and uses the extreme pressure gear lubricant therein as the operating fluid. A pump 150 distributes the gear lubricant through a pressure balanced spool valve 156 , responsive to a brake pedal controlled pilot pressure valve 169 associated with the transmission hydraulic system. The spool valve 156 has ports 158 and 162 communicating with the brake pres sure inlet 100 and lubricant inlet 126 of the drive axle. The brake port 158 is permanently connected to the spool valve inlet 154 and the lubricant port 162 is normally connected to the spool valve inlet. When the brakes are applied the spool 172 temporarily isolates the lubricant port 162 from the spool valve inlet 154 to apply the entire flow from the pump 150 to the brakes.
