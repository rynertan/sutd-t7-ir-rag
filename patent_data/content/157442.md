## Description
Specification Eur.Patent Appl.Nr.85.200317. 7. Int.Class. A 23L 3 36.A process method and an appliance for the preparation of preservable deep frozen meals, and a product obtained with this method.Applicant Frid or B. V., Kade 10, NL 4600, Bergen op Zoom.The invention relates to a process method and an appliance for the preparation of preservable deep frozen meals which should merely be removed from the package, put into a frying pan with some fat and heated up with stirring, after which these are ready for consumption.The invention also relates to the product so prepared.So called instant meals and plates are already known.There is an increasing demand for such products, but disadvantages are the poor appearance, the restricted preservability and the fact that the product should be heated in an oven during about 45 minutes, while in most cases it does not comprise the completeness of components desired, and it is not blended in such a manner that it might be served but for additional treatment.Moreover the so called plates subsist of little vegetables and potatoes and of relatively too much meat, and after heating the degree of state of being done of the several components is mostly divergent, such that the vegetables are overdone for example, while the meat is not sufficiently done, and the potatoes are partly overdone and yet partly locally raw.Potatoes as a whole and in larger pieces are not very freeze proof, since they might become glassy at subsequent heating.This is particularly relevant for certain potato races being cultivated in zones of moderate climate, to such an extent that these appeared to be less suitable for the conventional treatment with machine processing units.Investigations have been carried out to find an instant meal composition applopriate for deep freezing and for storage during extensive periods of time, keeping a nice performance and good properties in terms of taste and nutritional value while no additional treatment should be necessary.The very extensive experiments have shown that the detrimentals such as the glassiness and loss of relish can be obviated for improved potatoes,such as used for french fries precedingly roasted.It has been discovered that by the use of a certain sequence of treatment stages of steam peeled, brushed and cut potato parts,a product can be obtained which,compounded with deep frozen cut onicns, paprika, green garden peas, corn, leek and carrots or parsnip gives a savoury instant meal, which is well preservable in a deep frozen state and which is directly consumable after warming up.The process method for the preparation of deep frozen preservable meals, consisting of potatoes and vegetables and which can be taken of the packaging and be consumed directly after warming up, is characterized according to the present invention, in that potatoes, after washing and peeling with steam and brushing are subjected to cutting by a device of knife blades, the cut produce being dewatered and blanched in a combined conveyor blanching vat during 5 6 minutes at about 75 C, subsequently cooled with rinsing water in a countercurrent cooler down to 25 30 C, the cooled strips blanched once more in water in a screw type blanching device during 5 6 minutes at 0 80 C,predried in 0 75 80 C,predried in a three stage hot air conveyor drier to an eventual moisture content of about 75 , the dried strips are fried in hardened vegetable fat during about 60 seconds at 1750 1850C, the cuttings are precooled with atmospheric air on a conveyor cooler to 15 C and subsequently frozen in a conveyor freezer to 15 C, after which the cut product is sorted at the length desired, mixed in its deep frozen state in a mixing drum with deep frozen onions, paprika, green peas, corn, leek and carrots, and the mix is weighed and packed. The blanching is necessary to deactivate enzymes.The proportion of the components is preferably as follows potato strips 40 by weight carrots 18 by weight leek 12 by weight corn 6 by weight onions 6 by weight paprika 6 by weight green peas 12 by weight. With this method of processing,damage and and decrease of quality are prevented.The installation for the process is schematically shown in the enclosed drawing.Therein 1 is the washing station, 2 is the steam peeling device, 3 a conveyor with brushes, 4 an after washer, 5 a water pump, 6 a consistent knife blade block, 7 a dewatering station, 8 a blanching conveyor, 9 a counter current cooler, 10 a screw blanching device, 11 a three stage conveyor drier, 12 a frying pan, 13 a coolerconveyor, 14 a freezer conveyor, 15 a sorting screen strainer, and 16 a slowly rotating mixing drum for composing all the components.The product obtained can be packed upon vacuum drawn dishes or plates of hard polystyrene with sealed film,or in plastic bags.During blanching and all other preparatory treatment stages crumbling ought to be prevented. Product damage influences the appearance of instant meals, and therefore it has been tested how such detrimental influences, by mechanical transport, storage in bags, and by sun light and moisture, could be eliminated.Cleaning, sorting and treatment on appropriate conveyors as described have proved to be favourable for the handling of composed food mixtures, if carried out with special care.The behaviour of free flowing food materials during transport in processing circumstances has been studied by N.N. Mohensenin and published in Physical Properties of plant and animal materials Gordon Breach,New York, 1970 . According to the above described method care is taken and measures can be observed to prevent damage of the constituents of the food such that the meal will comply with exigences of national and international authorities.
