# Method for determining lipid bound sialic acid in whole blood.

## Abstract
The amount of lipid bound sialic acid in a whole blood sample may be determined by a method, which may be auto mated, involving the following steps adding to the sample a lower alkyl alcohol and deionized distilled water mixing the re sulting admixture adding to it a mixture of lower alkyl chlori nated hydrocarbon and a lower alkyl alcohol treating by mixing and centrifuging the mixture until a recoverable, substantially clear upper phase forms recovering the upper phase and adding to it a protein precipitating agent, preferably in admix ture with an adsorbing material mixing the resulting admix ture recovering the resulting precipitate, suspending the pre cipitate in distilled water and determining the amount of lipid bound sialic acid present. The presently preferred mixture for addition to the upper phase is a mixture of 75 by weight phosphotungstic acid and 25 by weight silica gel on a dry weight basis. By so determining the amount of lipid bound sialic acid present in a whole blood sample and comparing the amount with values obtained for subjects known to have cancer one may diagnose the presence of cancer in a subject. Alterna tively, by determining the amount of lipid bound sialic acid present in whole blood samples obtained from a subject over a period of time and comparing each amount so determined with preceding amounts one may monitor the progression, remis sion or recurrence of cancer in a subject.
