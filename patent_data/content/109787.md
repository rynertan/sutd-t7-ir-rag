# Angle stations for endless conveyor belts.

## Abstract
In an angle station for an endless conveyor belt, there are presented to each incoming run of the belt stationary curved guide members 18, 19 of the shape of a major segment of a right circular cylinder and having in the part cylindrical portion 16 or 17 thereof rectangular open ings 15 arranged in parallel and helical paths and through which project small freely rotatable rollers 14 , the con tinuously changing segments of the curved surfaces of which projecting through said openings 15 are in attitude to change the direction of travel of the belt 13 through 90 during passage of the belt about the part cylindrical portion 16 or 17 of the guide member 18 or 19 . The rectangular openings 15 are arranged with their longer edges lengthwise of the diagonals representing the mean of the helix but with those of a plurality of the rows nearest to each end of the part cylindrical portion 16 or 17 slightly out of axial symmetry with said diagonals, being slightly inclined in a direction about the intersections 40 to provide a toe in attitude in relation to the line of run of the endless conveyor belt.
