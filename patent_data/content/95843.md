# Photovoltaic cell interconnect.

## Abstract
Module 30 of interconnected rectangular photovoltaic cells 2 comprises strip 14 for connecting cells 2 into series strings. The strip 14 comprises tabs 21 spaced as collector pads 7 on a cell 2 to facilitate connection thereto and a bus portion 20 for connection to the opposite surface 8 of an adjacent cell 2 min . The strip 14 is coated on both sides with dielectric lamina 26, 27 to prevent short circuiting between opposite surface 4, 8 of the same cell 2 when cell spacing is extremely close. Apparatus and method for automated manufacture of cell arrays employing this interconnect are also disclosed.
