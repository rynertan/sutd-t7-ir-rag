# Activators for Ziegler type polymerization catalysts.

## Abstract
In the polymerization of alpha olefins using a catalyst based on a vanadium compound and an organometallic compound the activity of the catalyst can be enhanced by addition of an activator, such as a chlorinated derivative of furoic acid ester or bis trichloromethyl sulfone.
