# Method of and apparatus for forming focusing diffraction gratings for integrated optics.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method is disclosed for making unchirped holographic diffraction gratings that are formed from curved lines in a thin film. First and second beams of coherent optical radiation are respectively focused to first and second focal lines g,f which lie in plane x,y that is substantially perpendicular to a planar photo sensitive material 5 upon which the two beams interact to form an interference pattern.
