# Oscillator circuit.

## Abstract
Oscillator circuit comprising an amplifier arrangement A, A connected to a reference level an output and an input thereof being coupled via a single signal carrying terminal t, t to a resonant network Z, Y which is connected to the same reference level as the amplifier arrangement A, A , the resonant network Z, Y comprising a crystal resonator Q , in which oscillator circuit a stable oscillation at a higher order crystal resonant frequency is achieved by means of an LC network LC, L C, which selects said higher order crystal resonant frequency and a resistor R
