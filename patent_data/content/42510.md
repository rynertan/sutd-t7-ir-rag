# Current switch driving circuit arrangements.

## Abstract
This current switch driving circuit arrangement particu larly for, but not necessarily limited to, inductive device current switching, comprises a pair of output transistors 56, 58 constituting a driving transistor 56 for turning ON a subsequent switching transistor and a current sinking tran sistor 58 for turning OFF that switching transistor. A receiver circuit 70 is arranged for applying one bilevel logical signal for alternatively driving the two transistors 56, 58 by way of intermediate circuits 30, 108 each having current multiplying circuitry for deriving the necessary driving currents. The intermediate circuitry 30, 108 is effective for toggling the current from one of the transistors 56, 58 to the other with provisions for insuring speedy switching action.
