# THERAPEUTIC DEVICE

## Abstract
A therapeutic device for reversing osteoporosis in hu man limbs comprises a crank assembly 14 adapted to be attached to the distal ends of a pair of human limbs, such as the legs 60, 62 , a motor 16 for rotating the crank assemb ly so that the limbs move along a predetermined path, a vi brator 18 for vibrating the crank assembly, thereby trans mitting vibrations to the limbs, and a control 86 for regulat ing the amplitude of the vibrations transmitted to the limbs. The control means include an accelerometer 82 adapted to be mounted on a supported limb 60 to generate a signal proportional to the amplitude of the vibrations actually felt by the limbs. This signal is used to modify the amplitude of the electric current generated by the control 86 to power the vibrator 18 such that the amplitude of the driving vibra tions generated by the vibrator is proportional to the ampli tude of vibrations felt by the limbs and the amount of vibra tion of the limbs is maintained within a predetermined range.
