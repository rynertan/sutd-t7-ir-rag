# PICKUP DEVICE FOR PICKING UP VIBRATION TRANSMITTED THROUGH BONES

## Abstract
A pickup device for picking up vibration transmitted through bones or solid bodies in which a piezoelectric ele ment 6 is disposed like a cantilever within a liquid tight case 5 filled with a viscous liquid 8 in such a way that the free end of the piezo electric element can vibrate with respect to the liquid tight case. The viscosity of the viscous liquid 8 ranges from 30 to 10000 cs so that the sharpness of resonance of the piezoelectric element 6 can be suitably suppressed.
