# An apparatus for monitoring printed papers.

## Abstract
An apparatus for monitoring automatically plural sheets of printed papers, comprises a plurality of photo sensors 1 placed across the printed papers moving direction for scanning and detecting a printed surface of each printed paper to produce analog signals designating dark levels of the printed surface thereof when each of the printed papers is being transferred, an AD converter 13 for converting the analog signals into digital signals at a plurality of sampling points, a standard memory 15 for storing such digital signals, a plurality of monitoring memories 16 for storing such digital signals, means 31, 32 for comparing the digital signals of the standard memory 15 with the digital signals of the monitoring me mories 16 at the corresponding sampling points to decide whether or not the digital signals of the moni toring memories 16 are within a tolerance range of the digital signals of the standard memory 15 so that either NO signals or YES signals are produced, means 51 for counting only such NO signals to pro duce an irregular or non identity signals when the number of such NO signals sums to a predetermined value, and means for electrically compensating shifting of the papers when the digital signals of the standard memory are compared with the digital signals of the monitoring memories.
