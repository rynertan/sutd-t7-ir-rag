## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING VANADIUM HALIDES The present invention relates to a process for preparing vanadium halides or vanadium oxyhalides and more particularly but not exclusively to an improved process for preparing vanadium chloride or oxychloride in a fluidised bed reactor. Vanadium halides, and more particularly vanadium oxytrihalides, have been prepared by reacting organic halide vapours with vanadium compounds. British Patent No.897,187, for example, describes a process for preparing vanadium oxychloride by passing dry chlorine gas over a mixture of finely divided vanadium pentoxide and lampblack. Also, U.S. Patent No. 3,591,525 to Markham et al describes a process for preparing a catalyst consisting of a glass of vanadium pentoxide and potassium pyrosulphate absorbed by silica gel particles, which comprises introducing a preheated mixture of silica gel particles and particles of the glass into a fluidised bed reactor equipped with filters at the top of the reactor, where the particles are rapidly heated to a temperature of between 300 and 400 0C at which the glass vanadium pentoxide and potassium pyrosulphate melts and impregnation of the silica gel Qccurs. U.S. Patent No. 2,698,330 to Fugate et al describes a process for preparing phthalic anhydride in a fluidised bed reactor in which a naphthalene air mixture is introduced into the base of a fluidised bed reactor containing supported vanadium pentoxide where the naphthalene is partially oxidised with the formation of a major proportion of phthalic anhydride and minor quantities of maleic anhydride. The resultant mixture which may contain finely divided catalyst passes from the top of the reactor into a separation zone containing a filter element. The catalyst is separated by passage of the gases through the filter after which they leave the reactor where the phthalic anhydride is removed. Fluidised bed reactors equipped with high temperature filtration apparatus to remove particles from the fluidising gas discharging from the bed are described in U.S. Patent No.4,161,389 to Staffin et al. In these reactors, particles which are entrained in the discharging stream are collected on the filter units as the discharging stream passes therethrough. The filter units are cleaned periodically with compressed gas. In preparing vanadium compounds such as vanadium oxytrichloride from vanadium pentoxide and activated carbon, it has been found that the process is very inefficient because the vanadium pentoxide is lost from the fluid bed by elutriation and accumulates as sludge in the still and in the crude storage tank. Also, removing and disposing of the sludge from the still and crude storage tank presents a hazardous disposal problem. We have now devised a process for preparing vanadium halides and oxyhalides in a fluidised bed reactor whereby the vanadium halides and oxyhalides can be obtained substantially free of impurities, more efficiently. According to the invention, there is provided a process for preparing vanadium halides or oxyhalides, which comprises reacting a vanadium compound selected from vanadium oxyhalides and vanadium pentoxide, with a halogen in the presence of carbon particles in a fluidised bed reactor, characterised in that the reaction is conducted in a fluidised bed reactor containing gas permeable filter elements which are maintained at a temperature such that the vanadium halide or oxyhalide products are in the vapour state. In one example of the process of this invention, vanadium pentoxide is reacted with chlorine gas in the presence of activated carbon in a fluidised bed reactor equipped with internal filters, at a temperature of from about 3000 C to 4000C, more preferably at about 3250 C to 375 0C, to form vanadium oxytrichloride. The vanadium oxytrichloride is separated from other entrained solids such as vanadium pentoxide and carbon particles by passing the vanadium oxytrichloride vapours through the internal filter elements in the reactor into a condenser where they are condensed and collected. The entrained solids in the vapour stream are collected on the filter elements and then at periodic intervals blown back into the reactor. The reaction may be represented by the following equation EMI3.1 In another embodiment of this invention, vanadium oxytrichloride is reacted with chlorine gas in the presence of.activated carbon in a fluidised bed reactor equipped with internal filters, at a temperature of from about 6000C to about 7000C, to form vanadium tetrachloride. The vanadium tetrachloride vapours are separated from carbon particles by passing the vanadium tetrachloride through internal filters in the reactor into a condenser where they are condensed and collected. The reaction may be represented by the following equation EMI3.2 The invention will be further illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings which diagrammatically show the preferred processes for preparing vanadium chloride and oxytrichloride. In order that the invention may be more fully understood, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 illustrates diagrammatically one form of apparatus for preparing vanadium halides or oxyhalides and FIGURE 2 is a diagrammatic view of the fluid bed reactor. In preparing vanadium oxytrichloride, vanadium pentoxide is preferably mixed with carbon particles in a closed storage tank 1 and the mixture containing vanadium pentoxide and carbon particles is introduced into fluidised bed reactor 2 through feed line 7 . The feed tank 1 , is preferably equipped with a means for pressurising the tank with an inert gas. Any inert gas may be employed to transfer the vanadium pentoxide carbon mixture from feed tank 1 to the fluidised bed reactor 2 .Examples of suitable inert gases which may be employed are nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide, and air which is substantially free of moisture. Although it is preferred that the vanadium pentoxide and carbon be mixed prior to introduction into the fluidised bed reactor 2 , the vanadium pentoxide and carbon particles may be added separately to the reactor. The fluidised bed reactor 2 comprises a chamber 8 defined by a sidewall 9 , an expansion chamber 10 and a dome 11 which is connected to discharge line 1 through which vanadium oxytrichloride is discharged to condenser 4 . The fluidised bed reactor 2 is capable of fluidising and uniformly heating granular solids from ambient tempera 0 ture up to about 700 C using electrical or full fired heating means. The fluidised bed reactor 2 is equipped with port 13 through which the fluidised bed may be removed to maintain the desired bed height. Also, the reactor 2 is equipped with a high temperature filter system 3 which prevents particulate fines of vanadium pentoxide and carbon from discharging with the vanadium oxytrichloride to the condenser 4 through discharge line 12 . The fluidised bed reactor 2 is equipped with an inlet 14 through which chlorine gas is introduced into reactor 2 at a point at or near the bottom of reactor 2 and below distributor plate 15 through which the chlorine gas diffuses upward through the bed of carbon and vanadium pentoxide. It is preferred that the chlorine gas be passed into the reactor containing carbon particles and vanadium pentoxide at such a rate that the carbon particles and vanadium pentoxide will be fluidised and maintained in a buoyant state. The fluidised gas leaving chamber 8 of reactor 2 contains some entrained particles, often termed fines, which consist of carbon particles and unreacted vanadium pentoxide as well as chlorine gas and reaction products.The fluidised gas, together with the entrained solids and reaction products enters expansion chamber 10 which contains filter elements 3 and then flows through the filter elements from the exterior to the interior into dome 11 where it is discharged through line 12 into condenser 4 . The entrained solids are removed from the fluidised gas and collected on the exterior surface of the filter elements 3 . The filter elements 3 consist of a plurality of gas permeable tubes which are resistant to corrosion.These filter elements may be fabricated from, for example, stainless steel, monel, inconel, platinum, and ceramics.These tubes which are closed at the bottom and open at the top are generally mounted at the top in a manifold plate 16 within dome 11 . The filter elements 3 extend through manifold plate 16 and at their upper ends are tapered to form.venturi 17 . Lines 18 which contain flow control valves 19 extend through dome 11 down to venturi 17 for reversing the flow of gas through porous filters 3 . It is preferred that lines 18 extend down to within about one inch 2.54 cm of venturi 17 . When the solids build up on filters 3 becomes so great that a pressure drop occurs across the filters, then the filters are cleaned by reversing the flow of gas through one or more of the porous filter elements. This may be achieved by, for example, opening flow control valve 19 in line 18 connected to line 20 through which a high pressure inert gas is introduced. One or more filters may be cleaned at a time by opening flow control valves 19 in lines 18 to force gas through the filters and into chamber 10 . The solids are blown from the exterior surface of the filters 3 into chamber 10 where they fall counter to the flow of fluidised gas into reactor 2 for further reaction. In operating the process of this invention, one or more of the filter elements 3 may be cleaned by forcing an inert gas through line 18 under pressure into venturi 17 . The vanadium oxytrichloride vapours are discharged through line 12 to the base of condenser 4 where the vapours are cooled to form liquid vanadium oxytrichloride and then passed into storage tank 5 . The uncondensed gases which pass through condenser 4 are transferred through line 21 to a scrubber. The vanadium oxytrichloride collected in storage tank 5 is purified by transferring the material through line 22 , valve 23 and line 24 into distillation apparatus 6 , where the purified vanadium oxytrichloride is recovered. The fluidised bed reactor may be used continuously without any carry over of entrained solids consisting of vanadium pentoxide and carbon particles. In addition, the process reduces pollution of the atmosphere and substantially enhances purification of the vanadium oxytrichloride. The process described above may also be used to prepare vanadium tetrachloride. In this process carbon particles are added to reactor 2 through line 7 to a height of from about 10 to 20 inches. Vanadium oxytrichloride vapours and chlorine gas may be combined in line t14 and introduced into reactor 2 below distributor plate 15 , or they may be introduced into reactor 2 through separate lines. The amount of chlorine gas introduced into reactor 2 is about 5 percent in excess of the stoichiometric amount required for the reaction. The vanadium tetrachloride formed in the fluidised bed reactor passes upwards through reactor chamber 8 into into chamber 10 and through filter elements 3 into dome 11 . The vanadium tetrachloride passes from dome 11 through line 12 to condenser 4 where it is liquidified and collected in tank 5 . The vanadium tetrachloride can be transferred from tank 5 through lines 22 , and 25 to a storage tank. Filter elements 3 , consisting of a plurality of gas permeable tubes which are resistant to corrosion, separate vanadium tetrachloride from entrained particles such as carbon particles and also provide for increased residence time in the reactor. The amount of chlorine gas employed in the preparation of the vanadium chlorides and oxychlorides will range from about the stoichiometric amount up to about 10 percent excess and more preferably about 5 percent by weight in excess of the stoichiometric amount required for the reaction. The excess chlorine may be recycled to reactor 2 or it may be transferred to a scrubber where it is treated with caustic. The mole ratio of vanadium pentoxide to chlorine is not critical and may range from about 1 3 to 1 10 and more preferably from about 1 3.5 to about 1 4. Likewise the mole ratio of vanadium oxytrichloride to chlorine is not critical and may range from 1 1 up to 1 5 and more preferably from 1 1.5 to 1 2. It is preferred that the chlorine be employed in an amount which is about 5 weight percent in excess of the stoichiometric amount required for the reaction. In addition to chlorine gas, other halogenated compounds may be employed in the process of this invention.Examples of such compounds are benzotrichloride, 1,4 bis trichloromethyl benzene, trichloromethyl naphthalenes, bis trichloromethyl biphenyl, and trichloromethyl biphenyl. Other halogenated vanadium compounds can be prepared using the process of this invention from the corresponding bromine and iodine derivatives. The vanadium compounds prepared in accordance with the process of this invention may be used either alone or reacted with aluminum alkyls as catalysts for olefin polymerisations. Also, they may be used as intermediates in organovanadium synthesis. The following examples further illustrate the process of this invention in which all parts are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE 1 An apparatus such as that illustrated in Figure 1 is used to prepare vanadium oxytrichloride in which a fluidised bed reactor is heated to a temperature of at least 350 0C and a mixture containing carbon particles and vanadium pentoxide in a ratio of 1 10 is charged to the fluidisedbedreactor 2 through feed line 7 . The reactor and contents are maintained at a temperature above the vapourisation temperature of vanadium oxytrichloride.To the heated bed is introduced chlorine gas at a rate of about 5 percent by weight in excess of the stoichiometric amount required for the reaction. The gaseous chlorine passes upwardly through the bed at a sufficient velocity to maintain the bed in a fluidised state. This condition may be controlled and maintained by the introduction of chlorine gas along with an inert gas. The temperature in reactor 2 is maintained in the range of from 3000 C to about 4000C and the filter elements 3 at a temperature 0 above about 130 C. The products of the reaction pass upwards through reactor 2 into chamber 10 and through filter elements 3 to condenser 4 where the vanadium oxytrichloride is condensed and collected in tank 5 .The chlorine gas discharged from condenser 4 , is passed through line 21 and recycled to reactor 2 or transferred to a scrubber where it is treated with caustic. The vanadium oxytrichloride may be transferred from tank 5 to distillation apparatus 6 where it is further purified. When the filter elements 3 are maintained. at a 0 temperature above about 130 C, the fluidised bed reactor can be run continuously for at least seven days before the elements become plugged. However, when the temperature of the filter elements 3 fall below about 1300C, the elements become plugged after operating about one day.Example 2 The process of Example 1 is repeated except that the fluidised bed reactor is heated to a temperature of from 3500 to 400 0C and the temperature of the filter elements 3 is maintained at a temperature of from 1300 0 to 160 C. Vanadium pentoxide is fed into the fluidised bed reactor 2 at a rate of 30 pounds hour along with carbon particles at a rate of 3 pounds hour. Chlorine gas is fed into the bottom of the fluidised bed reactor 2 below the distributor plate 15 at the rate of 35 pounds hour.The velocity through the filters is maintained at about 2 to 2.5 feet minute. The fluid bed is maintained at a height of from about 15 to 18 inches, by either adding vanadium pentoxide and carbon particles or removing a portion of the bed through port 13 . Vanadium oxytrichloride is recovered from the reactor at a rate of about 55 pounds hour. A yield of about 96 percent vanadium oxytrichloride is obtained.Example 3 The process of Example 1 is repeated except that vanadium oxytrichloride is substituted for the vanadium pentoxide. Carbon particles are fed through line 7 into reactor 2 to maintain a bed of from 15 to 18 inches in height above distributor plate 15 and vanadium oxytrichloride and chlorine gas are fed into reactor 2 below distributor plate 15 . The vanadium oxytrichloride and chlorine gas are fed together through line 14 into the reactor 2 below the distributor plate 15 . The gaseous chlorine, which is introduced at a rate of about 5 percent in excess of the stoichiometric amount required for the reaction, and vanadium oxytrichloride pass upwardly through the distributor plate and the carbon particles at a sufficient velocity to maintain the bed in a fluidised state. This condition may be controlled and maintained by the introduction of chlorine gas along with an inert gas. The temperature in reactor 2 is maintained above about 6500C and the filters at about 1600C.The vanadium tetrachloride, chlorine gas and carbon particles pass upwards through reactor 2 into chamber 10 where the carbon particles are separated from the vanadium tetrachloride and chlorine gas by filter elements 3 . The vanadium tetrachloride and chlorine gas pass through filter elements 3 line 12 and into condenser 4 where the vanadium tetrachloride is condensed and collected in tank 5 . The vanadium tetrachloride may be removed from tank 5 through lines 22 and 25 . The chlorine gas exiting from condenser 4 passes through line 21 where it may be recycled to reactor 2 or transferred to a scrubber where it is treated with caustic.Example 4 The process of Example 1 is repeated except that benzotrichloride is substituted for chlorine and carbon. The benzotrichloride is heated to a temperature of about 215 0C and introduced into the fluidised bed reactor 2 .
