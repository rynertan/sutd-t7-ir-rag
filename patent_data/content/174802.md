# Percutaneous implant device.

## Abstract
A percutaneous implant device comprises a nonporous biocompatible conduit 12 having an attached flange 14 , the flange having a top and a bottom. In the preferred embodiment, at the top of the flange, where the flange and conduit connect, the conduit emerges from the flange, necks inwardly and then flares outwardly forming an hourglass configuration. Above this neck the conduit forms substantial ly a right angle bend, the conduit when extending substan tially parallel to the skin. The device is implanted in the body such that the flange is below the surface of the skin. By reason of the bend in the conduit, the conduit can be grasped and held firmly while pressure is applied parallel to the kin surface to insert a needle into or apply a cover cap to the conduit. The conduit walls are preferably narrowed at the neck portion 20A to allow flexure at that point.
