# METHOD FOR INHIBITING MINERALIZATION OF NATURAL TISSUE DURING IMPLANTATION

## Abstract
Natural tissues fixed with a tanning solution such as glutaraldehyde and intended for implantation in humans, e.g., porcine heart valve prosthetic devices, are treated with a solution of a water soluble phosphate ester such as sodium dodecyl hydrogen phosphate to inhibit mineralization, parti cularly calcification, of the tissue after implantation.
