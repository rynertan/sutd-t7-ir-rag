# MOTOR DIFFERENTIAL DRIVE REEL TENSIONING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A tape tensioning device for tape recorder drive systems having first and second reels. A mechanical differential is dis posed between the reels to permit counter rotation of the reels. A variable torque electrical motor is coupled to the dif ferential for rotating same. An electrical sensor determines the tension in the tape and outputs a signal to servo control circuit ry. The servo control circuitry varies the current to the differen tial drive motor, thus varying the torque applied to the differen tial drive means to maintain constant tension on the tape. The appropriate tape tension may be preset and adjusted to the appropriate value.
