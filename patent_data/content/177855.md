## Description
This patent application is related to commonly assigned Patent Application US SN 548,745 and European Patent Application 84 112 884, EP A 141383 respectively. This invention relates to nuclear magnetic resonance NMR apparatus. More specifically, this invention relates to radio frequency RF coils useful with such apparatus for transmitting and or receiving RF signals. In the past, the NMR phenomenon has been utilized by structural chemists to study, in vitro, the molecular structure of organic molecules. Typically, NMR spectrometers utilized for this purpose were designed to accommodate relatively small samples of the substance to be studied. More recently, however, NMR has been developed into an imaging modality utilized to obtain images of anatomical features of live human subjects, for example. Such images depicting parameters associated with nuclear spins typically hydrogen protons associated with water in tissue may be of medical diagnostic value in determining the state of health of tissue in the region examined. NMR techniques have also been extended to in vivo spectroscopy of such elements as phosphorus and carbon, for example, providing researchers with the tools, for the first time, to study chemical processes in a living organism. The use of NMR to produce images and spectroscopic studies of the human body has necessitated the use of specifically designed system components, such as the magnet, gradient and RF coils. By way of background, the nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon occurs in atomic nuclei having an odd number of protons or neutrons. Due to the spin of the protons and neutrons, each such nucleus exhibits a magnetic moment, such that, when a sample composed of such nuclei is placed in a static, homogeneous magnetic field, B₀, a greater number of nuclear magnetic moments align with the field to produce a net macroscopic magnetization M in the direction of the field. Under the influence of the magnetic field B₀, the aligned magnetic moments precess about the axis of the field at a frequency which is dependent on the strength of the applied magnetic field and on the characteristics of the nuclei. The angular precession frequency, ω , also referred to as the Larmor frequency, is given by the Larmor equation ω γ B, in which γ is the gyromagnetic ratio which is constant for each NMR isotope and wherein B is the magnetic field B₀ plus other fields acting upon the nuclear spins. It will be thus apparent that the resonant frequency is dependent on the strength of the magnetic field in which the sample is positioned. The orientation of magnetization M, normally directed along the magnetic field B₀, may be perturbed by the application of magnetic fields oscillating at or near the Larmor frequency. Typically, such magnetic fields designated B₁ are applied orthogonal to the direction of the B₀ field by means of RF pulses through a coil connected to radio frequency transmitting apparatus. Under the influence of RF excitation, magnetization M rotates about the direction of the B₁ field. In NMR studies, it is typically desired to apply RF pulses of sufficient magnitude and duration to rotate magnetization M into a plane perpendicular to the direction of the B₀ field. This plane is commonly referred to as the transverse plane. Upon cessation of the RF excitation, the nuclear moments rotated into the transverse plane precess around the direction of the static field. The vector sum of the spins forms a precessing bulk magnetization which can be sensed by an RF coil. The signals sensed by the RF coil, termed NMR signals, are characteristic of the magnetic field and of the particular chemical environment in which the nuclei are situated. In NMR imaging applications, the NMR signals are observed in the presence of magnetic field gradients which are utilized to encode spatial information into the signals. This information is later used to reconstruct images of the object studied in a manner well known to those skilled in the art. In performing whole body NMR studies, it has been found advantageous to increase the strength of the homogeneous magnetic field B₀. This is desirable in the case of proton imaging to improve the signal to noise ratio of the NMR signals. In the case of spectroscopy, however, this is a necessity, since some of the chemical species studied e.g., phosphorus and carbon are relatively scarce in the body, so that a high magnetic field is necessary in order to detect usable signals. As is evident from the Larmor equation, the increase in magnetic field B is accompanied by a corresponding increase in frequency and, hence, in the required resonant frequency of the transmitter and receiver coils. This complicates the design of RF coils which are large enough to accommodate the human body. One source of difficulty is that the RF field generated by the coil must be homogeneous over the body region to be studied to produce more uniform measurements and images. The production of uniform RF magnetic fields over large volumes becomes increasingly difficult at high frequencies owing to unwanted effects of stray capacitances between different parts of RF coils and between RF coils and surrounding objects or the NMR sample, itself, which limit the highest frequency at which the coil can be made to resonate. Conventional RF coils employ either one turn or two turns in parallel to minimize the inductance and increase the resonant frequency. An example of a conventional two turn coil is a so called saddle coil which is discussed in greater detail hereinafter. The concentration of the resonant current in so few turns reduces the homogeneity of the B₁ field and homogeneity of the sensitivity to signals produced in different parts of the sample region. Moreover, the lack of symmetry between the position of the tuning capacitor and the stray capacitance of the single turn coil lead to a non uniform current distribution in the coil and a corresponding reduction in the uniformity of the B₁ field and signal sensitivity. Another example of prior art coil is shown in DE A 3133432. It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide an RF coil capable of generating a substantially homogeneous B₁ field and which has substantially uniform signal sensitivity over the region of interest. It is another object of the invention to provide an NMR RF coil which is operable to produce a circularly polarized field and which exhibits an improved signal to noise ratio. It is still another object of the invention to provide an NMR RF coil having current and tuning capacitance distributed in many turns. In accordance with the invention, there is provided an NMR radio frequency coil having a pair of conductive loop elements spaced along a common longitudinal axis. Each of the loop elements includes a plurality of serially connected capacitive elements spaced along the loop peripheries. A plurality of axial conductive elements electrically interconnect the conductive loop elements at points between adjacent ones of the serially connected capacitive elements. In the high pass embodiment of the RF coil, the axial conductive segments may be wires, conducting tubes or flat conductive tapes whose inherent inductance is needed for proper coil operation. A band pass embodiment of the coil is realized by including capacitive elements in each of the axial conductive segments. The features of the invention believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Many NMR systems have access to the sample space along the direction of the static magnetic field which is typically selected to be along the Z axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. This is generally true of NMR systems which use superconducting magnets and is the case for nearly all human scale NMR imaging systems because of efficiency considerations. Therefore, the sample or human subject is inserted along the direction of the static field, and RF transmitting and receiving coils are often wound on cylindrical coil forms whose axes are parallel to the static field. The RF magnetic field must be perpendicular to the static RF magnetic field and thus perpendicular to the cylindrical coil form. FIGURES 1A and 1B depict schematically a saddle shaped RF coil of conventional design. The coil is made up of single turns 1 and 3 connected in parallel and driven at points 7 and 9 across a tuning capacitor 8. Such a coil is typically formed from copper tubing 5 which is mounted on a non conductive high dielectric cylindrical form 11, as seen in FIG. 1B. Each of the coil turns is sized to cover 120 of the cylinder s circumference. The coil region where connections 7 and 9 are made is sized to cover approximately 60 of the circumference. For maximum RF field uniformity, the side of the coils parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cylinder should be equal to two cylinder diameters D . However, a coil having a side length of two diameters is impractical, because RF energy is placed in regions of the patient which are not of interest. Therefore, in practice, the coil side length is reduced to approximately one diameter length. FIGURE 1C illustrates another embodiment of a conventional RF coil which is similar to that depicted in FIG. 1A, but in which coil turns 15 and 17 are connected in series and driven at points 19 and 20 across a capacitor 18. The coil illustrated in FIG. 1C is typically utilized in NMR studies of the head. In the case of each of the coils depicted in FIGS. 1A and 1C, the RF field produced is rather non uniform and, therefore, undesirable for NMR imaging applications. It is therefore apparent that current distribution needs to be controlled in a number of coil windings to produce a uniform B₁ field. Additionally, as already indicated hereinbefore, coil geometry should be such that there is free access along its longitudinal axis for positioning a patient or some other NMR sample. The B₁ field must also be perpendicular to the cylindrical axis of symmetry which is selected to be parallel to the direction of the B₀ field. An improved RF coil, disclosed in greater detail and claimed in the afore identified patent application, is schematically depicted in FIGS. 2A and 2B. Referring, first, to FIG. 2A, there is shown an eight section exemplary embodiment of the RF coil comprised of two spaced apart conductive loop elements 23 and 25 which are interconnected by eight axial conductive segments 27 34. Each of the conductive segments is provided with at least one capacitive element, such as those designated 35 42 corresponding, respectively, to capacitors in segments 27 34. Conductive loop elements 23 and 25 are each shown as having eight serially connected inductive elements in an eight section coil in loop sections between adjacent axial conductors. The inductive elements, generally designated by reference numeral 43 in loop 23 and 45 in loop 25, represent distributed inductances inherent in the conductors making up the loop elements. These inductances are needed for proper coil operation to achieve the desired phase shifts. The RF coil is excited by applying RF energy source not shown to leads 20 and 22 across an input capacitor such as capacitor 35 in one of the conductive segments. The RF coil depicted in FIG. 2A is based on a lumped element slow wave delay line structure which is depicted in FIG. 2B, wherein like parts are assigned like reference numerals. Referring now to FIG. 2B, conductive loop elements 23 and 25 are shown as straight conductors having a set of series connected inductive elements 43 and 45, respectively. Similar inductances, of course, are also associated with conductive portions of segments 27 34 however, these are not depicted in FIG. 2B. In general, the inductances associated with conductive segments 27 34 represent a smaller effect than the capacitive effect associated with the discrete capacitive elements 35 42 associated with each of the segments. The RF coil depicted in FIG. 2A is formed by electrically joining ends P P and Q Q of conductors 23 and 25 FIG. 2B , respectively. The RF coil shown in FIG. 2A and the corresponding lumped element network shown in FIG. 2B are referred to as low pass because a low frequency signal will pass along the inductive elements, while a high frequency signal will tend to be blocked by the inductors and shorted out by the capacitors. Coils having a number of axial conductors both greater and lower than 8 are also possible, including coils having either even or odd number of axial conductors. FIGURE 2C depicts a calculated graph of the current shown along the vertical axis in amperes through one of the inductive elements in a conductive loop such as 23 or 25 in FIG. 2A versus frequency shown along the horizontal axis in megahertz as would be obtained in a 16 section embodiment of the low pass RF coil similar to the eight section coil depicted in FIG. 2A. For purposes of calculating the current, it is assumed that the coil is driven with an RF source across an inductor in one of the loop elements 23 or 25 in FIG. 2A. Each of the eight current peaks 52 59 in FIG. 2C represents two resonant modes of the RF coil. Current peak 52 corresponds to two orthogonal resonant modes occurring at approximately 64 MHz the Larmor frequency of protons in a 1.5 tesla B₀ field which are of particular interest in NMR imaging applications. Excitation of the coil at this frequency utilizing a suitable source of RF energy not shown will produce a current distribution in loop elements 23 and 25 proportional to where k 1 to 16 refers to the conductive segment number starting at the input inductor. The currents through the axial conductive segments will vary sinusoidally in accordance with where k 1 to 16, as defined before. The second resonant mode can be excited by energizing the RF coil at a second input inductor at right angles to the first. An eight section embodiment of the RF coil in accordance with the invention is depicted in FIG. 3A. In general, the overall configuration of the inventive coil is similar to the low pass coil described with reference to FIG. 2A. Similarly, inventive coils having a number of sections greater than or less than 8 are contemplated within the scope of the invention. The inventive coil is made up of a pair of conductive loop elements 61 and 63 having, respectively, a plurality of serially connected capacitors, such as those designated 65 72 and 75 82. Conductive loop elements 61 and 63 are electrically interconnected by eight generally parallel axial conductive segments 85 92. The conductive segments are spaced about the peripheries of the conductive loops and are positioned such that adjacent ones of the segments are separated by capacitive elements in each of the conductive loops. Each of the conductive segments 85 92 has associated therewith an inherent inductance which is needed for proper coil operation. This inductance is generally designated by reference numeral 95 in FIGS. 3A and 3B. As before, the coil is formed by joining ends R R of conductive element 61 and ends S S of conductive element 63 to produce the conductive loop elements. FIGURE 3B shows a slow wave high pass ladder network structure so that the coil depicted in FIG. 3A is conveniently referred to as a high pass RF coil. The term high pass refers to the fact that high frequency signals will tend to be passed by the capacitive elements in the conductive loops because at high frequency the capacitors will present a relatively low impedance compared to the inductors, which will present a relatively high impedance. Low frequency signals, conversely, will tend to be blocked by the capacitive elements which will present a relatively high impedance and shorted by the inductive elements which present a relatively low impedance. The RF coil depicted in FIG. 3A has a number of resonant modes when excited by an RF power source not shown connected to leads 101 and 103 across an input capacitor 72. Only two of the resonant modes are of interest here. Specifically, the modes of interest are those in which the currents around the conductive loop elements are distributed in approximately Cos or Sin fashion, where is the azimuthal angle measured circumferentially around the coil, as indicated in FIG. 3A. Such sinusoidal currents produce a highly uniform transverse magnetic RF field which is desirable for NMR measurement and imaging applications. FIGURE 3C is similar to FIG. 2C and depicts a calculated graph of the current in amperes, indicated along the vertical axis, through one of the capacitive elements in one of the conductive loops versus frequency in megahertz, as indicated along the horizontal axis. The particular coil configuration utilized to perform the calculations was a 16 section high pass RF coil. One of the capacitive elements was selected as the input point and a 1 ampere input current applied thereacross. Each of the eight peaks 105 111 represents two resonant modes of the high pass ladder coil. Peaks 105 and 106 have apparently run together due to lack of resolution in the plot. The peak designated 112, occurring at approximately 64 MHz is the one of interest in NMR measuring and imaging applications of protons in a B₀ field of 1.5 tesla. Excitation of the coil at this frequency in the manner described hereinabove will produce a current distribution in the conductive loops proportional to where k 1 to 16 is the conductive segment number, starting with k 1 as the input capacitor. Thus, in FIG. 3A, capacitor 72 has been selected as the input capacitor, so that k 1 corresponds to conductive segment 86. The currents through the conductive segments 86 93 will vary according to where k is defined in the same manner. There is another orthogonal resonant mode at the same frequency which corresponds to exciting the RF coil across a second capacitor which is situated physically 90 around the conductive loop relative to the first input capacitor. In this case, the currents through the conductive loop elements and conductive segments are as above with k 1 corresponding to the second input capacitor. Excitation of the RF coil in the manner described with reference to FIG. 3A at a single excitation point results in a linearly polarized B₁ RF field. This linearly polarized field can be decomposed into two counter rotating vectorial components. One component rotates in the direction of the spin precession and can be effective in perturbing the spins. This is called the co rotating component. The other component rotates in the direction opposite to the spin direction and can have no effect on perturbing the spins. This is called the counter rotating component. Both components deposit power in the RF coil and NMR sample or human imaging subject by inducing eddy currents in the sample. Therefore it is apparent that if the RF coil can be made to create only the co rotating component, then a saving of approximately a factor of 2 can be realized in the power dissipation compared to the power dissipated by linearly polarized RF magnetic field which produces the same effect on the nuclear magnetization. In this case, the RF field is said to be circularly polarized. The term quadrature excitation is applied to the technique used for exciting the coil so as to produce circular polarization. Quadrature excitation and detection of the NMR signal can be achieved in a straight forward manner using the inventive coil described with reference to FIG. 3A. This can be accomplished by exciting the coil at two input capacitors located at right angles relative to one another along the circumference of one of the conductive loop elements. Referring to FIG. 3A, this can be accomplished by exciting the coil as before across capacitor 72 at leads 101 and 103 and additionally exciting the coil at a second pair of leads 113 and 115 across a capacitor 66. Additionally, to achieve the desired circular polarization, the RF sources used to excite the coil at the two points must be electrically 90 out of phase relative to one another. That is, the phase of one of the sources must be proportional to Cos ω t and the phase of the other source proportional to Sin ω t. In this manner, the two modes with approximately uniform transverse fields, as described above, are excited. A further feature of the coil can be realized by utilizing multiple RF amplifiers not shown to energize the coil. Each amplifier is attached to a different input capacitor, and the signal through each amplifier is phased correctly to produce the desired RF excitation i.e., linearly or circularly polarized . In this way the power requirement from each amplifier is reduced as compared to the requirement for driving the coil with one or two amplifiers. This may be particularly advantageous when high frequency solid state transistors are used to produce RF power output, as it provides a simple way to combine the outputs of several circuits without using power combiners in the initial amplifier. One example of the use of multiple RF sources to achieve circularly polarized excitation would be to use four RF amplifiers. Two of the amplifiers would be connected across capacitors 66 and 72, as shown in FIG. 3A. Two additional amplifiers would be connected across capacitors 68 and 70 at an angle 180 and 270 , respectively. Electrically, the phases of the amplifiers are separated by 90 between adjacent amplifiers. For this example, the phases of the four RF amplifiers could be 0 , 90 , 180 , and 270 , for amplifiers connected at 0 , 90 , 180 , and 270 , respectively. A simple example of utilizing multiple RF sources to achieve linear excitation would be to use two RF amplifiers connected across capacitors 72 and 68, FIG. 3A, 0 and 180 , respectively and energized 180 out of phase relative to one another. A modification to use four amplifiers would be to connect two additional amplifiers across capacitors 78 and 82 in conductive loop 63, such that if the phase of these amplifiers is 0 and 180 , respectively, then the phase of amplifiers connected across capacitors 68 and 72 would be 180 and 0 , respectively. It should be recognized that the multiple amplifier configurations described above are merely exemplary and many other combinations utilizing four or more amplifiers are possible. The two orthogonal modes can also be used to receive the NMR signal due to the precession of magnetization M. Reception of the NMR signal in this manner provides an improvement in the signal to noise ratio by a factor of The inventive RF coil can be fabricated using any suitable construction technique. Head and body coils each having 16 axial conductive segments 16 sections have been constructed for use at about 64 MHz. The head coil was constructed on a plexiglass coil form having an outside diameter of .28 m. and length of .4 m. In the head coil, the axial conductive segments are preferably formed from thin conductive copper tubing, but can also be made from either copper clad printed circuit board or wire. Suitable copper tubing has been found to have 3 mm. 1 8 inch outside diameter. An advantage in using tubing is that losses are minimized due to better current distribution. Another advantage in utilizing tubing in the construction of the head coil is that, due to the thinness of the tubing, large slots can be created in the coil form between adjacent conductive segments, thereby allowing good ventilation, as well as minimal visual obstruction for both the patient and operator. The conductive loop elements can be constructed from copper clad, double sided printed circuit board material utilizing, for example, Teflon resin as the substrate material which acts as the capacitor dielectric. The capacitor plates are comprised of overlapping conductive copper areas on opposite sides of the substrate. It may be desirable to form a plurality of discrete pads in one of the capacitor plates which can be bridged as necessary to increase or decrease the area of overlap between the plates thereby to increase or decrease the capacitance. A plurality of such capacitors are electrically interconnected in a loop to form the conductive loop elements. The capacitors for the head coil to resonate at 62.5 MHz have a value of about 95 picofarads pF . The body coil can be constructed in a manner similar to that described for the head coil. The axial conductive segments have been fabricated using 38 mm. wide copper tape on a cylindrical fiberglass coil form about .56 m. long and having an outside diameter of about .51 m. The coil itself is about .5 m. long. The capacitive elements were selected to be approximately 105 pF. Other body coils have been made in which copper tubing having an outside diameter of 6 mm. was used for the axial conductive segments. Additional detail of the method of RF coil construction can be ascertained by reference to the aforeidentified related patent application. By way of comparison, the inventive coil ladder network coil produces a significantly more uniform RF field than does the saddle coil. This is because the current distribution in the inventive coil, when it is excited in the desired mode, more closely approximates the ideal surface current distribution that gives a perfectly uniform transverse RF field. That is, a perfectly uniform B where λ is the surface current density, is the azimuthal angle and µ₀ is the permeability of free space. In a practical coil it is necessary to provide return currents and to limit the coil to a finite length. In the finite length ladder network coil of N sections e.g., 8 or 16 , there are a number of resonant modes which produce a current distribution proportional to The field homogeneity of the ladder network coil can be compared to that of the saddle coil by evaluating the spherical harmonic expansion of the field produced by each coil. The field in the center of the coil can be represented as an expansion in spherical harmonics, e.g., wherein r , ϑ , and are the spherical polar coordinates of a point under consideration, superscript x designates the expansion in the direction of x axis, and where P is the associated Legendre function. In particular, the B₁ field at the center of the coil is The coefficient A XC 00 , which represents the homogeneous component of B₁, can be calculated by integrating over the currents on the coil surface. A XC 00 can then be expressed as with M 1. It is convenient to note that the currents in the ladder network coil can be represented as and FIGURES 4A and 4B show all the coefficients necessary to completely express an arbitrary magnetic field in terms of a spherical harmonic expansion. Since a uniform, constant transverse field over the interior of the RF coil is desired, ideally only the term A C 00 should appear. However, since the current distribution in the saddle coil and the inventive finite ladder network coils of the invention are only imperfect approximations to the ideal sinusoidal current distributions, the resulting field is impure and the impurity is characterized by the appearance of other coefficients into the field expansion. In FIGS. 4A and 4B the undesired additional coefficients representing the non zero higher order components that contaminate the field are circled. Thus, FIG. 4A shows the additional coefficients which appear in the expansion of the field produced by a saddle coil and FIG. 4B shows the additional coefficients for the field produced by a 16 section ladder network coil. It should be noted that the latter produces far fewer unwanted coefficients. More specifically, FIG. 4A displays the higher order components that contaminate the field of the saddle coil. The inhomogeneities arise from two features the finite length of the coil, and the fact that the current distribution is not perfectly sinusoidal. As K aspect ratio is increased, it can be shown that the contaminants of B In terms of homogeneity, the ladder coil design has two advantages. First, as illustrated in FIG. 4B, for any values of K the coefficients A XC nm will be zero unless m has the specific values m 0,2,14,16,18,30,32,34,... it has been assumed that N 16 . This is a result of the sinusoidal distribution of current. Furthermore, as the aspect ratio is increased indefinitely, only terms of the form A XC 00, A XC 16 FIGURES 5A D and FIGURES 6A D depict contour plots of constant, normalized RF field strength produced, respectively, in the saddle coil and in an inventive coil having 16 axial conductive segments. In each case, the A Figures depict contour RF field strength in the transverse midplane of the coil. Figures designated B depict the field in a transverse plane located one half radius from the coil is midplane, while the Figures designated C show the field in a plane passing through the cylindrical symmetry axis of the coil and containing the RF field. Finally, the Figures designated D depict contours of RF field strength in a plane which is perpendicular to the RF field and contains the cylindrical symmetry axis. It will be apparent from the spherical harmonic analysis set forth hereinabove and from FIGS. 5 and 6 that the inventive coil has a B₁ field of high homogeneity which is superior to the homogeneity produced by the saddle coil. As the aspect ratio is increased, the homogeneity and the advantage of the inventive coil over the saddle coil increases. Thus, if 1.0 represents a reference value of the field desired at the center of the coil, the field in the saddle coil deviates faster from this value in both the longitudinal and axial directions than does the inventive coil. FIGURE 7 depicts schematically another embodiment of the inventive RF coil which has some of the features of the low pass and high pass RF coils described hereinbefore with reference to FIGS. 2A and 3A, respectively. This embodiment of the coil, which will be referred to as a band pass RF coil, is made up of two conductive loop elements 131 and 133. Conductive loop elements 131 and 133 are provided, as in the case of the high pass coil, with a plurality of series connected capacitors 135 142 and 145 152, respectively. As in the case of the low pass coil, the conductive loop elements are interconnected by a plurality of axial conductive segments 155 162 which include a plurality of capacitive elements 165 172, respectively. Although this particular embodiment is depicted as having eight such axial conductive elements, as before, a number greater than or less than eight can be advantageously utilized in practicing the invention. Additionally, it should be recognized that the coil can be energized either by connecting an RF power source, not shown, across one of the capacitive elements in one of the conductive loops, or across one of the capacitive elements in one of the axial segments. Other excitation techniques disclosed hereinbefore are also applicable to the band pass coil. It should be further understood that each of the conductive portions of either the conductive loop elements or the axial conductive segments has associated therewith an inherent inductance which, although not shown, is needed in order to achieve the correct degree of phase shift so as to produce the desired resonance conditions. In the band pass RF coil, the resonant modes are more compressed than in either the high pass or low pass coils. These modes align between a low frequency limit at which both the axial and loop impedances are predominantly capacitive and a high frequency limit at which both the axial and loop impedances are predominantly inductive. In the frequency band in which the modes reside, the capacitor values are such that the loop conductors are inductive while the axial segments are capacitive, or vice versa. The first case is analogous to the low pass coil in that it is the lowest frequency modes of the set which produce an approximately uniform transverse RF magnetic field. When the capacitances are such that the axial segments are inductive while the circumferential segments are capacitive, then the highest frequency transverse modes are the ones that produce the uniform transverse fields, and this configuration is analogous to the high pass RF coil. The band pass coil configuration may be useful in extending the slow wave delay line network coils to higher frequencies or to lessen the effects of stray capacitance coupling to the imaging subject or the surroundings. For example, using the high pass coil as the basic configuration, capacitances can be inserted into the axial segments. These axial capacitors can be made to cancel some of the inductance of the axial segments, such that the total impedance of the axial segments is lessened. Then, for a given current, the voltage along the axial segment will be less than it was with no capacitors, and the current through stray capacitances will be less, thereby reducing losses and detuning effects associated with the stray capacitances. From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that, in accordance with the invention, several embodiments of an RF coil are provided in which the current and tuning capacitance are distributed in many turns. The inventive NMR RF coils also provide a considerable improvement in the uniformity of the B₁ field and signal sensitivity. The geometry of the coils also permits improvements in signal to noise ratio and circularly polarized excitation. While this invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments and examples, other modifications and variations will occur to those skilled in the art in view of the above teachings. Accordingly, it should be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than is specifically described.
