# Process for production of carbon artifact precursor pitch.

## Abstract
A low coking pitch suitable for carbon artifact manufacture, especially carbon fiber manufacture, is obtained by heat soaking and vacuum stripping a distillate recovered from a bottoms fraction from the thermal and or catalytic conversion of a pet roleum fraction. Preferably the distillate is one which boils in the range of about 450 C to 510 C at 760mmHg. The distillate is heat soaked, preferably in the range 350 C to 500 C for up to 20 hours and then vacuum stripped at below 400 C, preferably to remove from 20 to 60 of the heat soaked distillate boiling below 400 C.
