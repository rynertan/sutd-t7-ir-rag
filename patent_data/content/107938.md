The present inventors have now succeeded in synthesizing the quinoline or hydroquinoline compounds of formula I having a different ring skeletal structure from the above benzopyran compounds. These compounds of formula I in accordance with present invention have been found to have various pharmacological activities such as blood pressure lowering activity, vasodilating activity, adrenergic ss blocking activity, and blood flow increasing activity. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide novel quinoline or hydroquinoline compounds of formula I and a process for producing them. In the compounds of formula I in accordance with this invention, the 2 hydroxy 3 isopropylamino propyloxy group of the formulaEMI3.1 may be bonded to any of the 1 to 8 positions of formula I , preferably to the 4 , 5 or 8 position.The group R may be bonded to any of the 5 to 8 positions.

Specific examples of the compound of formula I are as follows 4 , 5 , or 8 2 hydroxy 3 isopropylamino propyloxy N 2 or 3 nitroxypropyl quinoline 2 or 3 carboxamide, 4 , 5 , or 8 2 hydroxy 3 isopropylamino propyloxy N 2 or 3 nitroxypropyl 7 trifluoromethylquinoline 2 or 3 carboxamide, l 2 nitroxymethyl 5 quinolyloxy 3 isopropyl amino 2 propanol, l methoxycarbonyl 2 or 3 nitroxymethyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 8 3 isopropylamino 2 hydroxy propyloxy quinoline, 2 or 3 nitroxymethyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 8 3 isopropylamino 2 hydroxy propyloxy quinoline, and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the above exemplified compounds. The compounds of formula I in accordance with this invention can be produced, for example, by the following process a or b . Process a A compound of the following formula 11 EMI4.1 wherein R, A, R , n and m are as defined above, is reacted with isopropylamine. Process b A compound of the following formula III EMI4.2 wherein R, A, R , n and m are as defined above is subjected to a nitrate ester forming reaction. In performing the process a or b , when m in the starting compound of formula II or III is 1 and R is a hydrogen atom, it is preferred to subject such a tetrahydroquinoline compound to the reaction in process a or b after the N atom in the tetrahydroquinoline ring is protected by a protective group, for example a lower alkoxycarbonyl group such as those exemplified with respect to the group R , or a benzyloxycarbonyl group. This protection can be carried out, for ex ample, by strongly stirring the tetrahydroquinoline compound in water, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran at room temperature to 80 0C in the presence or the corresponding halogenoformate and a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or NEt3. Amination with isopropylamine in process a can be carried out, for example, by contacting the compound of formula II with isopropylamine in a suitable solvent. The solvent which can be used at this time is an inert organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol. The reaction is carried out preferably under heating, for example under refluxing conditions. A reaction temperature of, for example, about 70 to about 900C may be employed. The reaction time can be properly selected, and is, for example, 0.5 to 5 hours. The nitrate ester forming reaction of process b can be carried out by contacting the compound of formula III with a nitrating agent such as fuming nitric acid or a mixture of it with acetic anhydride in the presence or absence of a solvent. Examples of the solvent which may be used are acetonitrile, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran. Preferably, the reaction is carried out at relatively low temperatures, for example about 40 C to room temperature. The reaction time can be properly selected, and is, for example, several minutes to 3 hours. The starting compound of formula II in process a can be produced, for example, by subjecting a compound of the following formulaEMI5.1 wherein R, A, R , n and m are as defined above, to a nitrate ester forming reaction. The reaction can be carried out in the same way as in process b except that the compound of formula IV is used instead of the compound of formula III . The starting compound of formula III used in process b can be produced by reacting the compound of formula IV with isopropylamine. Amination with isopropylamine can be carried out in the same way as in process a except that the compound of formula IV is used instead of the compound of formula II . The compound of formula IV can be produced by a method known per se. For example, it can be produced by reacting a hydroxyquinoline carboxylic acid of formula IV in which A is the bond CONH with a hydroxyalkylamine H2N CH2t nOH wherein n is as defined above and an epihalohydrin. The amidation reaction with the hydroxyalkylamine and the epoxidation reaction with the epihalohydrin can be carried out, for example as follows. The hydroxyquinolinecarboxylic acid ester is reacted with an excess 2 to 10 equivalents of the hydroxylalkylamine at 80 to 150 0C for 1 to 10 hours in accordance with the following reaction scheme.EMI6.1 Then, the hydroxyquinoline is dissolved in an inert solvent such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, and after adding a base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, NEt3 or DBU, reacted with an excess 2 to 10 equivalents of an epihalohydrin at room temperature to gOOC for 1 to 20 hours as schematically shown below. EMI7.1 Furthermore, a compound of formula IV in which A is a direct bond can be produced, for example, by reducing the hydroxyquinoline carboxylic acid and reacting the product with an epihalohydrin. This reaction can be carried out, for example as.follows EMI7.2 The hydroxyquinoline carboxylicacid in reduced with a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride at room temperature to 80 C in a solvent such as ether or tetrahydrofuran, and then converted to a glycidyl ether by the method described above. The novel compounds of formula I in accordance with this invention which can be produced as above can be in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. The acid addition salt can be easily obtained by contacting the compound of formula I with a suitable inorganic or organic acid. Those acid addition salts which are pharmaceutically acceptable are preferred. Examples of the acid addition salts are hydrochlorides, nitrates, sulfates, phosphates, oxalates, maleates, methanesulfonates, ethanesulfonates, p toluenesulfonates, fumarates, lactates, malonates and acetates. The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts exhibit pharmacological activities such as blood pressure lowering activity, vasodilating activity, adrenergic ss blocking activity and blood flow increasing activity, and are useful, for example, as anti angina pectoris agents, hypotensive agents, cerebral circulation improvers and antiarrhythmic agents. Accordingly, there can be provided in accordance with this invention a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount, effective for treatment of cardiovascular diseases, of a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. Liquid or solid carriers or diluents may be used in forming the pharmaceutical composition. They may include excipients, binders, lubricants, emulsifiers, etc. known in pharmaceutical production.Examples of these carriers or diluents include starches such as potato starch, wheat starch, corn starch and rice starch sugars such as lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitrol and sorbitol celluloses such as crystalline cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose of a low degree of substitution inorganic substances such as potassium phosphate, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate and talc binder compounds such as gelatin, gum arabic, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and hydroxypropyl cellulose polyhydric alcohol estertype non ionic surfactants such as fatty acid monoglycerides, sorbitan fatty acid esters, sucrose and polyglycerol fatty acid esters and polyoxyethylenetype nonionic surfactants.
