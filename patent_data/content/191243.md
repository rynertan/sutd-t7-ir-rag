# PISTONS

## Abstract
An aluminium or aluminium alloy cast piston has a piston ring carrier of a ferrous material encast therein. The carrier has sides which converge towards their radially inner ends. As a result of this, and as a result of a lesser coefficient of thermal expansion of the ferrous material of the carrier as compared with the aluminium or aluminium alloy of the piston body, solidification of the piston material causes elastic outward expansion of the carrier which is sufficient to prevent any clearance occurring between the two parts, even at operating temperatures. Thus the carrier is not, and need not, be locked to the piston body against radial movement.
