## Description
Process and apparatus for extracting liquids from aggregates and from gas var,or mixtures.Technical field.The present invention relates to the extraction of a liquid from an aggregate, by evaporation in a stream of a carrier gas, followed by aerodynamic separation of said evaporated liquid from said carrier gas.In this specification, evaporation has a broad meaning which includes the production of vapor by a chemical reaction such as combustion.Similarly, aggregate has a broad meaning which not only includes materials soaked with a liquid, such as wet barley, paper, cardboard, plaster, but also materials which react with a gas, thus forming a vapor mixed with a carrier gas for example methanisation gas, natural gas, burnable waste products, fuel oil, coal, peat, brown coal, burning in air .More specifically, the invention relates to the way of putting at work the driving energy which provides the separative work, and of carrying out said separation. According to the invention, said driving energy is provided substantially under mechanical form to the carrier gas by one or several blowers which move the main stream of gaseous mixture against all head losses throughout the complete circuit of evaporation and separation, whether closed or open, and the vapor separation occurs essentially in an aerodynamic separator having no moving part. B first main application of the invention is the industrial drying, wherein it allows to recover water vapor and its latent heat from afrrvapor mixtures, using robust and cheap equipment with low energy consump tion, i e. a blower and an aerodynamic separator, instead of delicate and expensive apparatus such as heat pumps. A second main application of the invention is the abatement of acid gases, such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, from flue gases produced by combustion in boilers, furnaces, incinerators, through condensation of associateS water vapor, using said robust and cheap equipment, the energy consumption of which is low and more than offset by the recovery of the latent heat of condensation of the water vapor. b third maim application of the invention is the extraction and upgrading of the latent heat of condensation of a vapor in a gas vapor mixture, using said robust and cheap equipment. Said application includes heating, ventilating and air conditioning processes and installations.Other applications ofthe nvention will emerge from its detailed deseriptiov Background art.In the installation according to French patent publication 2 535 t45, hot air is used as the carrier gas which extracts water under vapor form from the aggregates to be dried. The evaporated water is then separated from the carrier air by cooling under constant pressure the air vapor mixture below its dew point, and collecting separately the water thus condensed. For cooling the air vapor mixture, and heating it up after water separation, the evaporator and the condenser of a heat pump are used successively.The driving energy for water separation is supplied as compression work of the working fluid of the heat pumpSuch installation thus requires a compression type heat pump, which is an expensive and delicate apparatus using special working fluids at rather high pressure.In the process according to French patent publication 2 444 882, compressed air is used in an air ejector for creating a suction effect enabling to progressively evacuate the pipes to be dried. After mixing in the ejector with the expanded air, the evacuated mixture of the carrier gas and water vapor is compressed in a diffuser and rejected in the environment without separation of said water vapor from said mixture. The driving energy for evaporating the water in the pipe is supplied under the form of external compressed air. The energetic efficiency of this process is extremely poor, as it uses ejectors and requires high vacuum to enable sufficient drying effect.U. S. Patent 3 977 850 shows a centrifugal separator which separates liquids entrained under the form of droplets in a gas stream by directing the mixture of fluids tangential to the diameter of a conduit.This device creates a centrifugal separation of liquid phase from gaseous phase in a two phase stream.The driving energy for separating the droplets from the main stream is the pressure differential of the fluid mixture throughout the separator.In this separator, the main stream undergoes two successive expansions generating kinetic energy. The first one takes place in the centripetal spinner at the inlet section of the vortex pipe, and the second one in the ejector nozzle at the outlet section of the vortex pipe. The kinetic energy generated within the fluid by the spinner in the vortex pipe is almost entirely lost by friction between adjacent streamlines. Similarly1 as the energetic performance of an ejector is very poor, only a very minor fraction of the kinetic energy of the fluid flowing out of the nozzle at the end of the vortex pipe can be recovered under the form of pressure Hence, the expansion of the gaseous component of the fluid mixture in this separator is almost isenthalpic. This fact rules out the possibility of any separation, including condensation followed by inertial separation, of a vapor mixed with a carrier gas flowing throughout this separator.Belgian Patent 5t 256 describes an apparatus aimed at agglomerating pre existing fine solid or liquid particles entrained by a carrier gas, to which ocipressed air is added through an aerojet for pulverizing fine liquid droplets of an agglomerating liquid. The stream of gas which contains aerosole or micro droplets passes at high subsonic velocity through a Venturi1 in which mechanical shocks between particles cause the fine particles to agglomerate in larger clusters or particles, the size of which is sufficient to enable their capture by downstream cyclone collectors. The size of the clusters or particles thus obtained may be further increased by ionization of the particles at the inlet of the Venturi, aadler by submitting the flow downstream of the Venturi to sonic or ultrasonic standing waves generated by a siren, before collecting the particles The driving energy generating said mechanical shocks is the pressure differential of the fluid mixture throughout the Venturi, while external compressed air is used to feed the aerojet and the siren, and electricity is used to ionize the fine particles to be agglomerated.This apparatus enables to increase by agglomeration the size of particles pre existing in a two phase fluid stream consisting mainly of a carrier gas without changing the total mass of said particles. while the two phase fluid stream passes through the convergent section of theVenturi it may occur that a vapor mixed with the carrier gas gets partially condensed in the form of fine droplets as a result of the nearly isentropic expansion of the mixture of vapor and carrier gas It may also occur that said droplets agglomerate by coalescence, like the particles entrained by the incoming fluid stream.However, as no device for collecting particles is provided at or near the throat of theVenturi, the particles continue to be entrained by the main stream in the diffuser part of the Venturi, where nearly isentropic recompression causes the carrier gas to heat up and thus to re evaporate the liquid droplets formerly created by condensation during expansion. Such re evaporation, if not complete at the outlet section of the Venturi, becomes complete after a short distance.Hence the Venturi part of the separator described in said Belgian patent doesn t allow to separate a vapor from a carrier gas contained in a stream of monophasic gaseous fluid.British Patent 1 283 587 describes a process and apparatus for separating the components of a mixture of gases which includes heavier and lighter species. The process comprises a accelerating said mixture of gases through a nozzle to form an expanded stream at supersonic velocity within a duct located downstream of the nozzle, b placing in the expanded stream hollow probe means having a plurality of apertures facing upstream and extending across the width of the duct at a sufficient distance from said nozzle to permit a shock wave to form upstream of the leading edges of said probe means to intercept said stream on axes offset from the nozzle axis by a plurality of transverse distances and optionally also on the nozzle axis , c withdrawing from said hollow probe means through a flow passage common to said apertures, a portion of the gas stream enriched in said heavier species.German patent application 2 301 467 shows a process similar to that one described in said British Patent, the difference being that the probes are disposed in at isast three different sections of the duct which follows the supersonic expansion nozzle. The process thus described in said British Patent and German patent application is based on an inertial effect on the various components of the gaseous mixture caused by the extremely high decelerations taking place as the molecules pass through a standing shock wave to the area of stagnation immediately behind this waveFree streaa Hach numbers need to be substantially higher than 1 and preferably of the order of 2 or 3 or more. Typical Knudsen numbers of from 0. 02 to 10 are mentioned, and isentropic stagnation pressures range from high vacuum to 100 Torr.The driving energy for gas separation is the pressure differential of the fluid mixture throughout the separator.Such process and aptitatos have sn extremely poor energetic performance, as kinetic energy losses in standing shock waves are very large.Moreover, the very low absolute pressures required are completely impractical in the field of application of the present invention.These facts rule out the possibility of separating, by condensation followed by inertial separation, a vapor mixed with a carrier gas flowing throughout this separator.French Patent 1 230 416 describes a process and apparatus for separating a gaseous mixture of gaseous or vapor materials, more particularly isotopes This process is based on differential velocities of diffusion of the different molecules in the gaseous mixture.The gaseous mixture first passes in a supersonic nozzle with an expansion pressure ratio larger than 1000. The stream flowing out of the nozzle enters in an enclosure in which it is partly diverted without special precautions aiming at recovering its kinetic energy, while the non diverted part of the flow passes through a truncated cone with a wide angle of aperture to enter in a second enclosure, wherefrom the stream is extracted at a pressure not exceeding 5 of the pressure of the gas stream entering the supersonic nozzle.The driving energy for gas separation is the pressure differential of the fluid mixture throughout the separator.The operating conditions in this separator are more or less similar to those described in the British Patent and the German patent application referred to hereabove.Due to the extremely poor energetic efficiency of this separator, its use is completely impractical in the field of application of the present invention, and any possibility of separating, by condensation followed by inertial separation, a vapor mixed with a carrier gas flowing throughout this separator, is ruled out.U.S. Patent 3 109 721 describes a method and apparatus for separating a fluid mixture by sonic energy.This process is based on the fact that a multi component fluid mixture may be separated into a fraction enriched into the heavier component and a fraction enriched into the lighter component by continuously introducing sonic energy to a zone of divergent cross sectional area so as to establish sonic waves having energy gradients, and introducing the multicomponent fluid mixture into the zone. The fraction enriched into the heavier component is concentrated in a section of the zone where the cross sectional area is relatively large and the fraction enriched into the lighter component is concentrated in a second section of the zone where the cross sectional area is relatively small.The introduction of the incoming stream as well as the extraction of both enriched streams are made perpendicularly to the axis of a truncated cone wherein resonant standing waves are created.As shown by the figures mentioned in the specifieation, the separation factors are rather small, and the feed rates range from 160 to 2,640 ce hour. The driving energy in this separator is the sonic energy generated at the throat of the truncated cone, and not the pressure differential of the gaseous mixture throughout the separator.The gaseous mixtures enriched in respectively light and heavy components are produced at opposite sections of the separator. Thls process provides Very poor yields and low throughputs. These facts rale out the possibility of its practical use for separating a vapor from a carrier gas in the field of application of the present invention. Belgian Patent 898 745 describes a process and apparatus for separating a mixture of fluids, which applies in fact to a mixture of gaseous constituentsThis process is based on the cremation, within a gaseous mixture flowing at subsonic velocity as an annular stream with varying cross section in a plurality of axisymmetrical cavities, of resonant acoustic standing wave interacting with nappes of moving toroidal vortices. As a result of the acoustic pressure field and of the intense centrifugal force field within the vortices, a spatial separation of specific constituents of the mixture under gaseous or vapor form is obtained, thus enabling to divert, through axial and peripheral diverters or traps, gaseous mixtures enriched in said constituents.The driving energy for separating the incoming gaseous stream into a main outflouing gaseous stream and a diverted outflowing gaseous stream with different compositions is the pressure differential of the gaseous mixture throughout the separator.This aerodynamic separation process and apparatus enables to partially separate a vapor mixed with a carrier gas, into a diverted stream enriched into the vapor and a main stream enriched into the carrier gasThe energetic efficiency of this process is poor, as the generation of interactive vortices and standing acoustic waves requires flow separation from the walls and recirculation such process requires that high amounts of kinetic energy be generated from the pressure of the flowing gas, while the efficiency of pressure recovery is very low, due to the losses of kinetic energy in the recirculating flow and in the vortices.Hence the adiabatic expansion of the gaseous flow throughout this separator is almost isenthalpic. This fact rules out the possibility of condensation of a vapor mixed with a carrier gas followed by inertial separation of the liquid droplets thus obtained.Summarizing the state of the art the known processes and apparatuses either do not separate a vapor from a carrier gas, or they do separate partially such vapor as a diverted gaseous stream enriched in said vapor with an energetic efficiency which is prohibitively low in the fields of application of the present invention, or they need the use of delicate and expensive apparatuses such as heat pumps to achieve said vapor separation with a practicable energetic efficiency.Summary of the inventionIt is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process and apparatus for extracting a liquid from an aggregate, by evaporation in a stream of carrier gas, followed by separation of said evaporated liquid from said carrier gas, with an energetic efficiency practicable in the fields of application mentioned, and without using delicate and expensive apparatuses such as heat pumps. It is another object of the invention to provide an improved process and apparatus for separating aerodynamically under liquid for a vapor mixed with a carrier gas in an aerodynamic separator having no moving part and wherein the driving energy is essentially the pressure differential of the fluid mixture throughout said separator.Other objects, advantages and features of this invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art upon consideration of the written specification, appended claims, and attached drawings.In the process and apparatus according to the invention, a carrier gas entering a circuit is used to extract a liquid substance from an aggregate, by evaporation of said substance The mixture of said vapor with said carrier gas is then driven through an aerodynamic separator wherein the driving energy supplying the separative work is provided by the pressure differential of the gas vapor mixture throughout the separator.Said separator causes the main stream of carrier gas to lose a substantial part of said vapor substance it contained, while the stream diverted by the separator is substantially enriched into said substance in vapor and or liquid form In the event that said form is at least partially vepeRo the main part of the vapor contained in the diverted stream is then condensed in an heat exchanger where its condensation heat is transferred to the main stream of carrier gas flowing out of the separator. If used in closed cycle, the thus reheated carrier gas is driven to the section where it entered the circuit, to run again along the same circuit.Alternatively, it is used in open cycle, in which case fresh carrier gas is heated up in heat exchangers, successively by the outflowing main stream of used carrier gas and by the outflowing derived stream leaving the separator if this stream contains separated vapor.Substantially all the steady state energy requirements of the process are supplied under the form of mechanical energy used to drive one or several blowers which move the main stream of gaseous mixture against all head losses throughout the complete circuit, whether closed or open.In a particular embodiment of the invention, the aerodynamic separator has the general shape of a convergent divergent nozzle. In the inlet plenum of this nozzle, auxiliary means may be provided in order to enhance the condensation process which occurs in the convergent part of the nozzle, where the stream of the mixture of vapor and carrier gas undergoes an adiabatic, quasi isentropic expansion producing a high velocity flow in which part of the vapor condenses as fine droplets entrained by the stream. Due to their large density as compared with the density of the gaseous phase, said droplets tend to continue to travel along straight lines, thus agglomerating and diffusing by their inertia through the curved streamlines of the flow of expanded mixture. Traps for collecting droplets are provided in the throat region of the nozzle.They are located both axially and along the inner surface of the nozzle, so as to intersect the streamlines of the droplets. Shortly after the throat of the separator nozzle, the high velocity stream of carrier gas enters the diffuser, i. e. the divergent part of the separator nozzle, where its kinetic energy causes an adiabatic, quasi isentropic recompression of the flow. As part of the quantity of vapor contained in the inlet stream is separated under liquid form, the stream flowing out of the separator nozzle has a higher specific enthalpy, and thus a higher temperature than the inlet stream. Hence this stream can be used as a source of useful heat. In another particular embodiment of the invention, the aerodynamic separator is an enclosure in which the stream of the mixture of vapor and carrier gas undergoes an adiabatic, quasi isentropic expansion including a steady component and an oscillatory component Said expansion causes part of the vapor to condense into fine droplets. Traps are provided for collecting these droplets at locations where they intersect the streamlines of said droplets in the region of the enclosure where the steady component of the expansion is close to its maximum. The steady component of the expansion is obtained by a reduction of the cross section of the stream.The oscillatory component is obtained by the action, within the flowing fluid, of very intense sonic or ultrasoni waves. Along a period of said oscillation, the expansion phase is followed by a compression phase during which the droplets of condensed vapor resulting from the expansion phase tend toward re evaporation. However condensation prevails over evaporation, as it is a mass phenomenon within the gaseous phase, while re evaporation only takes place at the surface of the droplets.After maximum expansion of the stream of gaseous mixture and separation of the condensed droplets1 the high velocity gaseous stream enters a diffuser where pressure recovery takes place through an adiabatic, quasi i sentropi C recoaprossiov Brief descriotion of the drawingsFigure 1 shows an application of the invention to closed cycle industrial drying.Figure 2 shows the same application using an aerodynamic separator extracting a steam enriched air valpor mixture instead of liquid water. Pigure 3 shows a converènt divergent separator nozzle according to a particular embodiment of the invention.Figure 4 shows a particular embodiment of the convergent section of the latter separator nozzle. Figure 5 shows an application of the invention to open cycle industrial drying. Figure 6 shows a particular embodiment of the aerodynamic separator wherein a spherical high intensity sonic wave is superimposed to a steady stream of expanding flow in a truncated conical convergent section, and wherein pressure recovery of the stream takes place in a diffuser section having a truncated conical divergent shape.Detailed description of preferred embodimentsIn the application illustrated by Figure 1, drying takes place in an enclosure 1 in which an aggregate, for instance wet germinated barley 2, stays on a tray 3. The blower 4 operates together with the burner 5 which is fed with combustion air 6 and fuel 7, producing combustion gases 8 which are mixed with the drying air 9. The burner 5 is controlled so as to maintain in the lower part 10 of the enclosure 1 the drying air temperature at the required level.Said air then crosses the wet barley layer 2 and leaves the enclosure 1 through its upper part 11 at a temperature which varies during the drying operation, but which is 20 to 30 0C lower than the temperature in 10. The moist air sucked from enclosure 1 in section 11 by the blower 4 is blown at 12 in a duct 13 which brings it to the aerodynamic separator 14. The latter separates the incoming stream of moist air into an outgoing main stream 22 of hot air with reduced moisture content and an outgoing diverted stream 20, composed essentially of cold water which is then rejected through the duct 21. The main stream is driven through the duct 23 up to location 9 where it runs again along the drying circuit.A valve 25 is provided in the duct 23 to enable the addition of fresh air in order to compensate for leaks or losses from the complete installation to the outside atmosphereFigure 2 shows a variant of the same embodiment in which the stream of air 15 leaving the aerodynamic separator is driven through a duct 16 to a heat recovery exchanger 17. The diverted stream 18, which leaves the separator 14, is enriched in water vapor. It is brought by the duct 19 to the heat exchanger 17 where it transfers its heat through the heat exchanger walls to the main stream 15. The diverted flow 18 is thus cooled and moot of the water vapor it contained is condensed and then rejected at 20 by the duct 21. The main stream, after having been heated in the heat recovery exchanger 17, gets out at 22.As shown by Figures 1 and 2, the process according to the invention is very simple. In steady state, the energy required by the operation of the process is supplied substantially under mechanical form through the blower 4.The fuel consumption required by the burner 5 is only a small fraction of what it would be if the blower 4 would reject the stream 12 in the atmosphere and if the air stream at 9 would come entirely from the external atmosphere. As compared with the known processes, the process according to the invention enables to reduce the energy consumption to a minimal value, without requiring high investment and maintenance costs.Indeed a burner 5 and a blower 4 are required in all the existing processes in this field of the invention If used, the heat exchanger 17 is an equipment required by all the known processes providing recovery of heat from used air to fresh air. Its investment and maintenance costs are moderate.The aerodynamic separator 14 is a static apparatus, the investment and operation costs of which are moderate. In the preferred embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 3, the moist air stream enters a vertical separator 26 having the general shape of an axisymmetrical convergent divergent nozzle. Along the axis of the separator nozzle 26 , a cylindrical collector 27, of which the diameter is small, is provided. The wet incoming air, having a velocity parallel to the axis of the nozzle, enters the upper plenum 28 of the separator nozzle, where means may be provided to cause the creation within the flowing fluid of nucleation centers.Said means may consist of devices which pulverize droplets of water or of any other material stimulating the nucleation, and or devices which generate sonic or ultrasonic waves, and or electromagnetic radiation having adequate frequency, f. i.ultraviolet rays, laser rays, ionizing rays, radar waves, and or electrostatic fields. The stream of moist air then enters into the convergent part 29 of the separator nozzle 26, wherein an expansion occurs, causing the condensation of vapor into fine dispersed droplets which are projected on the external surface of the trapping collector 27 and on the internal surface of the nozzle throat, which is surrounded by a collecting chamber 30. Said surfaces are made, on the full trapping length of the collectors 27 and 30, in a porous material or in a material having any other known permeable structure, through which the condensate formed by the droplets is sucked into the collector 27 and the collecting chamber 30, wherefrom it is driven outside the main circuit by any known means.After said separation of the droplets, the air stream leaving the throat of the separator nozzle 26 enters the divergent part of said nozzle where it undergoes an adiabatic, quasi isentropic recompression which brings its pressure back to a level close to that of the pressure in 28, and which increases its temperature to a level higher than the temperature level in 28. The throat of the nozzle has a constant section along a length sufficient to enable an efficient collection of the condensate.The velocity at any point of the main stream in the separator nozzle 26 only has axial and radial components, exclusive of any tangential component As a variant, one may provide at the inlet section of the separator nozzle 26 a cascade of blades which induces a free vortex flow which is superimposed to the axial and radial flow. Said free vortex, of which the amplitude may be small compared with the axial and radial components of the velocity of the main stream , favors the projection of the droplets of condensate on the internal surface of the collecting chamber 30 and may thus improve the efficiency of separating said droplets.Among the multiple variants which are possible for applying the process and apparatus accordion to the invention, one lust Invention those illustrated by Figures 4 and 5.Figure 4 shows a particular variant of the upper part of the separator nozzle 26 illustrated in Figure 3. In this variant, between the upper apace 28 and the convergent part 29, there is a central part 35 and a cascade of blades 36. Said cascade gives to the vertical flow of the main streak a tangential component which creates within this flow a free vortex with moderate amplitude Due to the particular shape of the convergent part of the separator nozzle shown in Figure 4, the axial component of the flow progressively vanishes along the streaalines, as it is progressively replaced by a centripetal radial component, thus creating a zone wherein the tangential component of the velocity of the droplets of condensate orient said droplets horizontally towards the external wall of the convergent part 29 of the nozzle, causing thee to travel against the pressure gradient in the lafn stream The condensate reaching the wall is sucked by a collector in a way similar to that one described for Figure 3. This particular provision may improve the efficiency of separating said droplets during the expansion. At the end of this expansion, the radial centripetal stream is bent as shown inFigure 4 to become again axial in view of its recompression in the divergent part of the nozzle.In Figure 5 the main streak of external fresh air is sucked at 37 and driven into a countercurrent heat exchanger 38 where it is heated by the stream of hot dried air 22 flowing out of the separator nozzle 26. The rain current of fresh air thus heated in the heat exchanger 38 is driven through a dact 39 to the blower 4, which blows it at 9 in the drier 8 enclosure 1. The main streaM of wet air 12 flowing out of the drier 8 enclosure then enters in the aerodynaaic separator nozzle 26, wherefrom the diverted streams composed principally of condensate, gets out at 20, the again stream 22 of hot dried air getting in the countercurrent exchanger 38 where it is cooled down to a teeperature close to that of the external atlosphere, and fron which it gets out in the atmosphere at 40. As compared with the eabodiaent of the invention shown in Figure 1, the variant of the invention shown in Figure 5 differs by the additional heat exchanger 38. Is shown in Figure 5, the operation in open cycle of the process according to the invention enables a permanent renewal of the air running through the drier s enclosure, at the cost of a slight increase of the energy consumption.Said increase results from, on one side, the increase of power output of the blower 4 which corresponds to the additional head losses in the heat exchanger 38, and on the other side, to the additional heat to be supplied by the burner 5, which must partially offset the temperature difference of the main stream between its inlet at 37 and its outlet at 40.The particular embodiment represented in Figure 6 shows an application of the invention to drying moist air. This operation takes place in a separator enclosure 61 having the general shape of an axisymmetric nozzle comprizing a cylindrical chamber 62, a convergent truncated cone 63, a throat 64 and a divergent 65. As shown in Figure 6 these elements are linked in such a way as to avoid angular points in the axial cross section of the nozzle. The general direction of the moist air flowing into the nozzle is shown by the arrow 66.The moist air entering the chamber 62 is submitted in this chamber to an acoustic radiation generated from the annular enclosure 67 by generators of sonic waves of any known type, so that at the inlet section of the air in the convergent part 63, the wave front has the shape of a spherical surface 68 of which the geometric center is located at a point 69 which is on the axis of the nozzle, downstream the minimal section of its throat 64. An adiabatic, quasi isentropic expansion of the flowing fluid occurs in the convergent truncated cone 63. The steady component of this expansion results from the reduction of the cross section of the fluid stream between the inlet of the convergent part 63 and the throat 64 of the nozzle 61. The oscillatory component of this expansion results from the spherical acoustic wave of which the front progresses from 68 to 610.All the streamlines within the convergent part 63 have rectilinear paths which are perpendicular to the front of the spherical acoustic waves and which converge toward a focus located at point 69. Under the effect of the combined steady and oscillatory expansions of the fluid roving in the convergent part 63, part of the water vapor contained in the incoMing streaM of moist air condenses as droplets. As the density of these droplets is larder, by a factor of the order of one thousand, than the density of the joist air entering the throat 64 of the nozzle, these droplets follow their rectilinear paths towards focus 69, and are only slightly deviated by the streanlines of dehuMidified air which they cross within the throat 64 of the nozzle.These droplets are then collected in a hollow cylindrical collector 611, having a sMall diaMeter, and located along the axis of the divergent part 65 of the nozzle, and of which the circular inlet cross section is centered at point 69 or slightly behind this point along the direction of the flow. The air stream froe which the droplets were thus swept away in the region of the throat of the nozzle enters the divergent part 65 where it undergoes an adiabatic, quasi isentropic recorpression transforMing into enthalpy the kinetic energy it has in the throat of the nozzle.As shown by Figure 6, the driving energy required by the separation of the fluid fixture in the nozzle 61 is supplied substantially as a pressure differential of said fluid fixture throughout the separator nozzle, while the amount of the acoustic energy radiated by the sonic wave only represents a Minor fraction of said driving energy. Moreover, the required aMount of energy of said sonic radiation aay be generated fror said driving energy by acoustic coupling between the annular enclosure 67 and the streak flowing in section 62 of the nozzle.In a particular eMbodiment of the invention, use is aade of the sonic radiation generated within the rein streaM of Moist air by the blower which raises the pressure of said lain stream. Said sonic radiation is eMitted anyway upstreaM as well as downstreaM by any blower. Said sonic radiation lay be properly enhanced, then shaped into a spherical centripetal wave directed toward the focus located at point 69. Alternatively, said radiation may be used in a way such that its wave fronts progress in the direction opposite to that of the main stream, in which case the shape of the diffuser of the separator nozzle should be a truncated cone as well as the shape of the convergent part of said nozzle. Rhether or not the sonic radiation front progresses backward rather than forward in the separator nozzle, its specific energy peaks in the throat region of said nozzle.Alternatively to generating the sonic radiation from the fluid pressure, or to using the sonic radiation created by the blower, it may be convenient in particular cases to produce separately the required sonic radiation, for instance by electromagnetic transducers, or by sound generators such as sirens, in which cases the sonic energy is supplied by an external source.Although the description of the process and apparatus according to the invention has been made for the particular application to industrial drying, said process using similar apparatus is applicable in any case where at least one constituent of any gaseous mixture can be extracted from said mixture through an adiabatic, quasi isentropic expansion causing said constituent to get partially condensed, and then separated under condensed formThe composition of the condensate thus obtained results from the composition of the gaseous mixture which is processed.For instance if the process according to the invention is applied to flue gases from industrial boilers burning coal, the condensate rill not be pure water, but a solution in water of one or several constituents of said flue gases, such as S02, No, N02, C02, This particular feature enables to separate easily, not only condensable vapors, but also gases difficult to condense, provided they are soluble in the condensate of easily condensable vapors.Said vapors can thus have a sweeper or scavenger actionIn case the contents of said scavenging vapor into the carrier gas is insufficient to sweep out of said carrier gas specific gases to be separated, or if its scavenging capacity is insufficient, one ay add to the fixture to be separated, before processing it, an additional constituent under gaseous and or liquid and or solid fore droplets or particles in suspension , which is able to act as a sweeper or scavenger of said specific gases. For instance sulphur dioxide 302 can be absorbed very easily by added acetic acid, of which the vapor is easily condensed, and easily absorbed by the condensate of water vapor.Said sulphur dioxide can thus be integrally swept out, and recovered by processing the separated liquid by any known means.The range of vapors and gases which can be extracted by the process and apparatus according to the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 6 is very wide, as the ratio between the initial pressure of the gaseous mixture to be processed and the MiniMal instantaneous pressure within the flowing mixture may be very high Indeed this ratio is the product of the pressure ratio of the steady coMponent of the expansion and the pressure ratio of the oscillatory component of the expansion. The greater the global pressure ratio thus obtained, the greater is the enthalpy drop after expansion, the greater is the corresponding texperature drop, and the more efficient is the separation achieved by eondensation In fact, the invention is applicable without any restriction to the extraction of any liquid from an aggregate Said aggregate lay be a mixture or a combination of different cheMical or isotopic coMponents in any proportions. The liquid to be extracted can be a siMple substance or a Mixture or a combination of different cheMical or isotopic coMponents in any proportion The carrier gas can be coMposed of any constituents in any proportions. As many possible eMbodiMents iny be Made of the invention without departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matter herein set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted in an illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
