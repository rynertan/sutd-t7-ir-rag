## Description
The invention relates to a method of applying self adhesive symbols in a desired pattern to a substrate, in which first the symbols are arranged in the desired pattern on a mounting sheet and subsequently picked up with the aid of a sticking strip applied across the symbols, the adhesion to the symbols being inferior to that between the symbols and the substrate, and stuck to the substrate, after which the sticking strip is removed. Such a method is known from Dutch patent specification 144.529. This known method operates satisfactorily in practice, especially for symbols of comparatively small size. When larger symbols are used a problem may be involved in that deformation of the symbols may occur when they are arranged on the mounting sheet. It may also be difficult to remove larger symbols arranged on a carrier sheet. During this treatment the symbol may be deformed and or torn up. Moreover in the case of large size symbols it is difficult to obtain the typographically correct spacing between the symbols on the mounting sheet and hence subsequently on the substrate. The invention has for its object to provide a solution for these problems. According to the invention this is achieved in that each symbol is temporarily stuck to its own carrier, the carrier is stuck to the mounting sheet, whilst the adhesion between the carrier and the mounting sheet is superior to that between the symbol and the carrier. Since each symbol is temporarily stuck to its own carrier, handling is considerably simplified. The symbol with its carrier is arranged on the mounting sheet so that it is possible to arrange the carriers with their symbols in the desired pattern without the symbol itself being touched. The carrier, which may be square or rectangular in shape, is of course insensitive to deformations during handling. After the symbols are removed from the carriers, the carriers remain on the mounting sheet. The adhesion between the mounting sheet and the carriers may be obtained by an adhesive layer on the mounting sheet or by an adhesive layer on the bottom side of the carrier. Placing the carriers with the symbols on a straight line is considerably facilitated when the mounting sheet is provided with a stop strip for carriers.It is then only necessary to lie the carriers with one of their sides against a stop strip on the mounting sheet in order to obtain the symbols on a straight line. The arrangement is furthermore facilitated when the side of the mounting sheet facing the carriers has a colour different from that of the top side of the carrier. The contrast will contribute to a ready arrangement of the carriers in line. When for example letters are arranged, the distance between the letters has to be chosen in accordance with given typographical rules for the letters concerned. This is considerably simplified when the circumferential shapes of the carriers are chosen in accordance with the symbols carried thereby. In this method a mounting sheet may be used, which has an adhesive layer on the top side. As an alternative the top side may have a stqp strip.The invention also allows the use of carriers with symbols, in which the side facing the symbols is coated with a glue repellent layer. On the side remote from the symbol the carrier may have a layer of glue for sticking the carrier to a mounting sheet. The adhesive layer may have a removable protective layer, which is removed prior to use. As a further alternative a protective sheet with the carriers according to the invention may be used. Prior to use the carriers are then removed from the protective sheet. As an alternative the adhesive layer may be applied to the top side of the mounting sheet. Then the mounting sheet has on the adhesive layer a removable protective sheet, which is removed prior to use. The invention will be described more fully with reference to drawings of embodiments. The drawings show in Figure 1 a carrier with a symbol in accordance with the invention, Figure 2 a mounting sheet according to the invention prior to use, Figure 3 a mounting sheet according to the invention during use, Figure 4 a sectional view taken on the lineIV IV in Figure 3, Figure 5 the mode of removal of symbols applied to the mounting sheet, Figure 6 the mode of application of symbols arranged on the mounting sheet to a substrate, Figure 7 a protective sheet with carriers and symbols. Figure 8 a sectional view taken on the lineVIII VIII in Figure 7, Figure 9 a mounting sheet with carriers in accordance with the invention and Figure 10 a sectional view taken on the lineX X in Figure 9. The mounting sheet 1 serves to arrange the carrier 2 with the symbols 3 applied thereto.Either the top side of the mounting sheet 1 or the bottom side of the carrier 2 is provided with an adhesive layer. In the embodiments shown in figures 1 to 6 the adhesive layer 4 is applied to the mounting sheet 1. Prior to use the protective sheet 5 is removed so that the adhesive layer 4 becomes accessible. The mounting sheet 1 has a stop strip 6 for facilitating the orientation of the carrier 2. The symbol 3 is provided with an adhesive layer 7 so that it is self adhesive. On the side facing the symbol the carrier 2 is glue repellent. After the carriers with the symbols are arranged see figure 3 an adhesive strip 8 see figure 5 is stuck across the symbols and the carriers. Subsequently the adhesive strip 8 is withdrawn.Since the adhesion between the adhesive strip 8 and the symbols 3 is superior to that between the symbols and the carrier, the adhesive strip 8 picks up the symbols, whilst the carriers are left on the mounting sheet see figure 6 . Subsequently the symbols are stuck to the substrate. Figure 7 shows a protective sheet provided.with a plurality of carriers with symbols. The carriers have on the bottom side an adhesive layer so that they remain stuck to the protective sheet.During use a carrier with its symbol is removed from the protective sheet and stuck in the manner described above to the mounting sheet, which in this case need not be provided with an adhesive layer. Figure 10 shows the mounting sheet 10, the carrier 11 with the adhesive layer 12 on the bottom side and the symbol 13 having the adhesive layer 14 on its bottom side . Figures 7 and 8 show the protective sheet 15 provided with the carriers and the symbols. The carriers with the symbols of figure 7 have a shape depending upon the nature of the symbol.According to typographical rules the space between the characters, for example letters, depends upon the shape of the characters in order to obtain an aesthetically justified appearance. The carrier for the letter tA has a shape differing from that for the letter B . According to the typographical prescriptions, for example, successive letters A11 can be arranged with the broad lower sides of the carriers in contact with one another. On the contrary if a letter A is followed by a letter E the narrowed part of the carrier of the letter A has to be put against the side of the carrier of the letter E , whilst the broadened part of the carrier of the letter A is stuck on the carrier of the letter E .
