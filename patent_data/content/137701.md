# Process for fabricating a semiconductor device including a barrier film.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device having contact windows be tween an aluminium or aluminium alloy wiring layer 11 and a diffused region 6, 7 in a semiconductor substrate 1 , includes a barrier film 10 of a refractory metal and silicon between the wiring layer 11 and the diffused region 6, 7 . The barrier film 10 prevents an alloy being formed between the layer 11 and the regions 6, 7 during a subsequent heat treatment step. The refractory metal and silicon film 10 is beam annealed for a short period of time e.g. 10 seconds or less to ensure complete silicidation so that adverse effects of using a barrier film such as weak bonded silicon and or a refractory metal to the aluminium or aluminium alloy wiring layer 11 are prevented and an excellent electrical or ohmic contact is obtained between the wiring layer 11 and the diffused layer 6. 7 .
