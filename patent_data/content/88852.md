# A process for regenerating electroless plating bath and a regenerating apparatus of electroless plating bath.

## Abstract
A process for regenerating electroless plating bath comprising the steps of i continuously or intermittently taking out a part or the whole of chelating agent containing copper electroless plat ing bath 12 from an electroless plating tank, followed by removing off the copper ion content from said bath ii acidifying the thus obtained solution for precipitating the chelating agent therefrom and recovering the precipi tated chelating agent iii supplying said recovered chelating agent to an anodic cell separated by an exchange membrane from a cathodic cell having cathode, said anodic cell having copper anode, wherein in case a neutral or alkaline electrolyte solution is supplied to said cathodic cell said partitioning membrane is an anion exchange membrane or cation exchange membrane, while in case an acidic electrolyte solution is supplied to said cathodic cell said partitioning membrane is a cation exchange membrane, and applying direct current between both electrode and iv then, recycling the solution within said anodic cell to said electroless plating tank, and a regenerating apparatus of electroless plating bath including a a copper precipitating means for decomposing the copper chelate contained in the electroless copper plating bath and for precipitating the copper ion, b a chelating agent recovering means for changing the pH of the solution to precipitate the chelating agent and recover, and c an electrolytic means comprising an anodic cell 33 and a cathodic cell 35 separated by means of an ion exchange membrane 37 , said anodic cell having a copper anode 39 therein, said cathodic cell having a cathode therein.
