# Method for synthesis of long chain carboxylic acids and alcohols.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with the preparation of long chain carboxylic acids and alcohols from cyclo dodecanone and acyl chlorides. More specifically, this in vention relates to a process for the preparation of 1 triacon tanol, CH₃ CH₂ ₂₈CH₂OH. Triacontanol acts as a growth sti mulant on a wide range of plants to increase dry weight gains, water uptake, water use efficiency and protein syn thesis in treated plants.
