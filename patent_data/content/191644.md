# SUBMERSIBLE CHAMBER WATER HEATER SUBMERSIBLE CHAMBER WATER HEATER

## Abstract
A water heater having improved efficiency. The water heater includes a tubular member 10 that is mounted in an opening in the side of the tank 2 and extends generally horizontally across the tank 2 . The tubular member 10 de fines a combustion chamber and a fuel burner 17 is located within the combustion chamber. The outer end of the tubular member communicates with the atmosphere and air is drawn into the tubular member and mixed with fuel to provide a mix ture which is ignited. The waste gases of combustion are dis charged from the inner end of the tubular member 10 into a heat exchanger 30 which is located in the tank beneath the tubular member, and the hot waste gases being discharged from the combustion chamber and passing through the heat exchanger 30 transfer heat to the water in the tank 2 . The heat exchanger 30 is connected to a stack 33 and a blower 32 is mounted in the stack downstream of the heat exchanger and serves to draw the waste gases of combustion from the combustion chamber through the heat exchanger 30 to the stack 33 .
