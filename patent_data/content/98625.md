## Description
TECHNICAL FIELD The present application relates to the preparation of alpha aspartic acid amides, in particular those amides suitable as non nutritive sweeteners. A number of alpha aspartic acid amides have been found to be suitable as non nutritive sweeteners. The most prominent examples are the alpha L aspartyl L phenylalanine lower alkyl esters, in particular the methyl ester. Because these L phenylalanine esters have hydrolytic stability problems, the art has searched for alternative aspartic acid amides having a non nutritive sweetening capacity. One such example is the l hydroxymethyl aspartic acid amide sweeteners disclosed in U.S. Patent nO 4,338,346, granted on July 6, 1982 and which have the following formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2 is a C4 C9 alkyl group, the amide having an L,L S,S configuration.Another such example is the l hydroxyethyl aspartic acid amide sweeteners disclosed inEPO Patent Application 0 068 551, published on January 5, 1983 and having the following formula EMI1.2 wherein R1 is methyl and R2 is a C49 alkyl group, the amide having an S,S,S configuration. The amides of the Brand and Rizzi Applications are formed by coupling certain beta hydroxy primary amines i.e., 2 aminoalcohols with an alpha L aspartyl moiety. While the economical synthesis of the beta hydroxy primary amines is particularly important, attention should also be given to the coupling reaction.The coupling reaction desirably involves an uncomplicated, inexpensive. synthesis step which is regiospecific for formation of the sweet alpha aspartic acid amides as opposed to the non sweet beta aspartic acid amides. The coupling reaction should also provide a relatively high yield of the particular amide at a relatively fast reaction rate. Further, retention of the specific stereochemistry at the asymmetric carbon centers is particularly critical during this coupling reaction. One method for preparing the amides of the Brand and RizziApplications involves the coupling of the beta hydroxy primary amines with an aspartic acid reagent having protecting groups. One such reagent is N carbobenzyloxy L aspartic acid, in particular the beta benzyl ester thereof. One disadvantage of this synthesis is the additional step s required to remove the protecting groups.Also, these reagents having protecting groups are fairly expensive.Further, coupling reactions involving such protecting group reagents require special coupling agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or a combination of N methylmorpholine and isobutylchloroformate. Another method for coupling the beta hydroxy primary amine to the aspartyl moiety involves activated aspartic acid reagents, in particular the aspartic anhydrides. Examples of such reagents include the hydrohalide salts of aspartic anhydride, as well asN trifluoroacetyl or N formyl aspartic anhydride. The direct reaction of these aspartic anhydrides with the beta hydroxy primary amines is not regiospecific. Instead, mixtures of alpha and beta coupled amides are formed. Generally, the alpha form predominates in a ratio of from 3 1 to 4 1. It is therefore an object of the present invention to prepare alpha aspartic acid amides by an uncomplicated, inexpensive coupling synthesis. It is another object of the present invention to provide a coupling synthesis for alpha aspartic acid amides which is regiospecific for the alpha , as opposed to the beta , amides. It is yet another object of the present invention to prepare alpha aspartic acid amides in high yield. It is a further object of the present invention to prepare alpha aspartic acid amides by a method having a relatively fast reaction rate. It is yet a further object of the present invention to prepare alpha aspartic acid amides wherein the specific stereochemistry of the amide is retained during the coupling reaction. These and other objects of the present invention are hereinafter disclosed. OTHER BACKGROUND ART Kovacs et al., Chemical Studies of Polyaspartic Acids , J. Org.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present application relates to a novel process for preparing alpha aspartic acid amides, in particular those disclosed as non nutritive sweeteners in the Brand and Rizzi Applications.This process involves the coupling reaction of an alpha aspartate ester with a beta hydroxy primary amine. The ester is reacted with the amine, one of which is preferably in stoichiometric excess, in a liquid phase system to form the alpha aspartic acid amide. The amide is then recovered from the liquid phase system. The process of the present application provides basically a single step, inexpensive synthesis for preparing the desired alpha aspartic acid amides. The alpha amide is formed almost exclusively by this process. A high yield of the amide can be provided at a relatively fast reaction rate The stereochemistry of the coupled amide is also retained by this process. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A. Alpha Aspartate Esters and Beta Hydroxy Primary Amines. A number of different alpha aspartate esters can be used in the process of the present application. In preparing non nutritive sweeteners, the esters are preferably the alpha L aspartate esters.Examples of such esters include methyl alpha L aspartate, ethyl alpha L aspartate, benzyl alpha L aspartate and cellosolve esters of alpha L aspartate e.g., the 2 methoxyethyl ester . These esters can be prepared by reacting an aspartic anhydride derivative with the respective alcohol. See Kovacs et al., Chemical Studies ofPolyaspartic Acids, J. Org. Chem., Vol. 26, 1961 , p. 1089 herein incorporated by reference , and Kovacs et al., Glutamic andAspartic Anhydrides Rearrangement of N carboxyglutamic 1,5 anhydride to the Leuchs Anhydride and Conversion of the Latter to Pyroglutamic Acid, 3. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 85, 1963 , pp.1843 44 herein incorporated by reference , which disclose methods for preparing methyl, ethyl and benzyl alpha L aspartate esters. A variety of beta hydroxy primary amines can also be used in the process of the present application. These amines have the following general formula EMI5.1 In preparing non nutritive sweeteners, R1 is preferably hydrogen or methyl and R2 is preferably a C4 C9.alkyl group e.g., straight or preferably branched chain alkyl, or cycloalkyl . R2 is most preferably 3 methylbutyl. The asymmetric carbon centers at a and b also preferably have an S configuration. These preferred amines can be prepared by the methods disclosed in U.S. ApplicationSerial No. 178,231 to L. M. Brand, filed August 14, 1980 herein incorporated by reference , and EPO Patent Application 0 068 551, published on January 5, 1983 herein incorporated by reference . B. Liquid Phase System. In the process of the present application, the alpha aspartate ester and the beta hydroxy primary amine are reacted in a liquid phase system. One example of such a liquid phase system involves a melt type reaction wherein the amine and ester are heated and melted together. The preferred liquid phase system is a solvent system.This solvent system can comprise either a non polar or polar solvent. Suitable solvents include dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, the C1 C3 alcohols, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, ethylene glycol and glycerol. A particularly preferred solvent is methyl alcohol. The alpha aspartate ester is preferably at least partially dissolved in the solvent system with the beta hydroxy primary amine being subsequently added. The amine or the ester is preferably in a stoichiometric excess with the excess reagent depending upon the amine involved. For the 2 aminoalcohols R1 hydrogen , either the ester or the amine can be in excess. For the l methyl 2 aminoalcohols R1 methyl , the amine is preferably in excess for a faster reaction rate and higher yield of the amide.Typically, the mole ratio of the excess reagent to the other is at least about 2 1, and preferably at least about 4 1. The concentration of the excess reagent is typically at least about 0.2M while the concentration of the other reagent is typically at least about 0.1 M. Preferably, the concentration of the excess reagent is at least about 2 M while the concentration of the other reagent is at least about 1 M. A higher mple ratio and or a higher concentration of both the ester and the amine increases the reaction rate with a higher yield of the alpha aspartic acid amide. C. Reaction Conditions. The alpha aspartate ester is reacted with the beta hydroxy primary amine at a temperature effective to cause formation of the respective alpha aspartic acid amide in an appropriate yield and at a sufficiently fast reaction rate. Typically, the reaction temperature is at least about 400C, and preferably within the range of from about 500 to about 1000C. In preparing the l hydroxyethyl aspartic acid amides of the Rizzi Application, i.e., where R1 is methyl for the beta hydroxy primary amine , the reaction temperature preferably does not exceed about 600C. At temperatures higher than about 600C, there is a tendency for the asymmetric carbon center of the aspartyl moiety of the amide to lose its S stereochemical configuration. The solvent used to dissolve the alpha aspartate ester is preferably removed from the solvent system during the reaction to improve the yield of the amide and to increase the reaction rate.Typically, the solvent is a highly volatile compound e.g., methyl or ethyl alcohol . In such cases, the solvent can be removed by subjecting the solvent system to an appropriate vacuum. It is believed that removal of the solvent during the course of the reaction encourages crystallization and subsequent precipitation of the desired amide from the solvent system. D. Recovery of the Amide from the Liquid Phase System.The alpha aspartic acid amide formed is preferably recovered from the liquid phase system during the reaction to improve the yield and increase the reaction rate. A preferred method involves precipitating the amide from the liquid phase solvent system. In such a precipitation step, the solvent system is selected so that the amide formed is insoluble therein. Once the amide is recovered, it can be purified by appropriate art recognized techniques, such as solvent recrystallization.Specific Synthesis of L l Hydroxymethyl Alpha L Aspartic Acid Amides. The following is a general reaction scheme for synthesizingL l hydroxymethyl alpha L aspartic acid amides EMI7.1 In step 1 of the above scheme, L aspartic acid 1 is converted by phosphorus trichloride to the hydrochloride salt of aspartic anhydride 2.
