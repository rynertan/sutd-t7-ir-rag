## Abstract
Device for detecting postal articles which are unsuited to be handles mechanically because of e.g. thickness, rigidity length and weight. The device consists of a bed of belts formed by a large number of resilient endless belts 2 assembled with a pre determined tension round two pullers 3 and 4 , which can turn round appurtenant shafts. These shafts are fixedly mounted on a basis plate. The two other ends of these shafts are coupled together by means of a frame plate 5 . A guiding roller 6 with an opposite guided conveyor belt has been arranged adjacent to the bed of belts in such a way that the part 9 of the conveyor belt 1 which leaves from said guiding roller 6 makes a predetermined angle with the opposite part 10 of the bed of belts. The bed of belts is taken along by the conveyor belt 1 by means of friction. A postal article moving on between the parts 7 and 8 will be subjected to a bending force when passing the guiding roller 6 . For this purpose the belts 2 of the bed of belts are working as scan ning elements, of which the deflection from the normal path beyond the guiding roller 6 can be detected by e.g. an infra red radiator detector combination 11 . The position of this single radiator detector combination 11 can be adjusted in such a way that postal articles which are too thick, too rigid or too heavy can be selected by means of a deflection detected by said radiator detector combination 11 .
