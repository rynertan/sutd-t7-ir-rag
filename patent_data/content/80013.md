# Method of making segmented heater assembly.

## Abstract
A picket of zig zag type heater for use in high tem perature furnaces 10 , such as are used for crystal growing for example, is constructed from a plurality of like graphite cylindrical shell segments 14 assembled into a cylindrical shell having uniform resistance heating characteristics by graphite connector elements 30 which also function to couple the electric current source to the heater.
