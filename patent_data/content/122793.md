# Grooved fibre of irregular thickness.

## Abstract
A thick and thin fibre has at least two axially continuous grooves per filament with the entrance widths of the grooves lying between 0.2 and 4 µm and the depths between 0.1 and 1.8 µm. Such a fibre is made by dissolving out the easily soluble polymer from a drawn composite fibre comprised of two thermoplastic polymer components having different sol ubilities. The fibre is of a silky nature and knitted and woven fabrics made therefrom have properties characteristic of silk fabrics.
