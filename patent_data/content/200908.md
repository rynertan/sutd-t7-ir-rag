## Description
The present invention relates to new perfluoroal kanes and haloperfluoroalkanes, characterized by having a low melting point and high thermal and chemical stabili ty, constituted by preferably branched perfluorinated or haloperfluorinated chains. More particularly, the invention relates to new preferably branched perfluoroalkanes and haloperfluoroal kanes, obtained from percursors characterized by contain ing in their chain two halogen atoms equal to or differ ent from each other, one of which necessarily being a iodine atom. A further purpose of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of said preferably branched perfluoroalkanes or haloperfluoroalkanes, by a method which can be easily implemented on an industrial scale. Perfluoroalkanes are known which are obtained by means of the Phillips electrochemical fluorination proc ess U.S. Patents Nos. 3,511,760 and 3,511,761 , which can be suitably used for the synthesis of several com pounds, among which perfluoroalkanes too. The limitation of this process derives both from the fact that it re sults expensive as regards the equipment installation and, above all, the energetic viewpoint, and from the fact that it allows conveniently fluorinating only com pounds having a low molecular weight. pounds products of up to six carbon atoms . Also perfluoroalkanes obtained by anionic oligomeri zation of perfluoroolefins U.S. Pat. 3,917,724 and 3,962,358 and subsequent fluorination of the double bonds are known, but the useful products which can be obtained are perfluoroalkanes of either 6 or 9 carbon atoms, whilst the other oligomers obtainable in practice show a high branching degree, which reduces the stability of such products see J. Fluor. Chem. 1981 Perfluoroalkanes are furthermore known, which are obtained by starting from aromatic hydrocarbons, such as, e.g., toluene, by fluorination with CoF₃, but this syn thesis requires the use of particularly sophisticated equipment, withstanding both the fluorine used to regene rate the CoF₃ which is reduced during the synthesis, and the high temperatures normally required for their synthe sis. Moreover, as the reaction proceeds, the replacement of the hydrogen atoms of the hydrocarbon used as the precursor of the perfluorinated compounds to be prepared, becomes more and more difficult, so that a not completely fluorinated fluid is obtained, containing byproducts still having hydrogen atoms. The presence of these byproducts decreases, among others, the thermal stability, the thermal and chemical inertia of the product, thus limiting the application field of these fluorinated fluids. Moreover, the methods for the separation of said not completely fluorinated byproducts are very expensive and difficult to be carried out. Iodoperfluoroalkanes can be obtained by telomerizing tetrafluoroethylene with such telogens as CF₃I, C₂F₅I, C₃F₇I. In this case, their preparation results anyway dif ficult, as CF₃I can be obtained ony by the decomposition of CF₃COOAg in the presence of iodine Hunsdiecker reac tion , and for the other two products the use of IF is required, which is notoriously difficult to be synthe tized and handled. By the present invention, the following purposes are essentially achieved The presence of a moderate branching in the molecular structures of the products of the invention is recommend able because, as it has been noticed, the products remain liquid within wider temperature ranges, although their boiling temperature does not excessively vary, and with out their stability be decreased, as it occurs with the highly branched products. For example, as it is described in Chemistry of Organic Fluorine Compounds , M. Hudlic ky, 1976 , page 532, the linear perfluoroparaffin with 9 carbon atoms has melting point and boiling point of respectively 20 C and 125 C, whilst perfluoro 2,4 dimethyl heptane has respectively 77 C and 124 C these latter data result from our measurements . The products according to the invention have the general formula The C₂F₄ units can be present in the molecular structure also alternated to the CF₂ CF CF₃ units. The diiodides according to the present invention are obtained according to the reaction scheme The corresponding difluorides are obtained by fluo rination with, e.g., elemental fluorine, according to the following reaction The dichlorides and the dibromides are obtained in a similar way, by treating the above indicated diiodides with respectively elemental chlorine or bromine. The products according to the present invention, wherein either X or Y is iodine, and the other is fluo rine, chlorine or bromine, are obtained by partial halo genation of the above mentioned diodides, and fractiona ting by distillation the reaction mixture obtained. An alternative method consists in using as the starting telogen ClC₂F₄I or BrC₂F₄I, the preparation of which is disclosed in the Italian Patent Application No. 19652 A 85, in this case however the insertion of the branched groups The products according to the invention, wherein one of the two halogen atoms X or Y is fluorine, and the other one is either chlorine or bromine, can be obtained by chlorinating or brominating products in which one of the two halogens X or Y is fluorine, and the other one is iodine. The products wherein one of the two halogens X or Y is chlorine and the other one is bromine are obtained by brominating products in which X or Y is chlorine, and the other is iodine. Examples of products according to the present invention are According to the present invention, 1.2 diiodote trafluoroethane IC₂F₄I is telomerized first with C₂F₄ and then with C₃F₆ or with C₃F₆ alone, at a temperature comprised within the range of from 150 C to 250 C, or at 45 C 150 C in the presence of peroxides, or also cata lyzing by the metal ion amine system, such as Cu ethanol amine. Also a mixture of C₃F₆ with C₂F₄ can be used, in this case C₂F₄ units alternating in the chain with The fluorinations can be carried out with elemental fluorine in the presence or in the absence of inert solvents, with or without U.V. radiations, or with fluo rides of metals having their maximum oxidation number, however operating under conditions considerably milder than those of the processes known in the art. The chlorination and the bromination can be carried out with elemental chlorine or respectively bromine, in autoclave, within the temperature range of from 100 C to 250 C, or by bubbling the gaseous halogen into the io dides used as the starting materials, maintained at 100 C 200 C, or also in the presence of U.V. radiations between 0 C and 50 C. The products according to the present invention are suitable to be used for a very large number of applica tions. So, e.g., the completely fluorinated compounds X and Y F are inert fluids, to be used as dielectric fluids, and as fluids for electronics testing, e.g., in the Thermal Shock Test, the Burn in Test, the Gross Leak test, and for the Vapour Phase Soldering , and finally as oxygen carriers biocompatible with blood. The dichlorides, having the two chlorine atoms rela tively far from each other, and the monochlorides X Cl, Y F or vice versa are stable, and can be used for some of the applications of the perfluorinated compounds X and Y F , when the use conditions are not too se vere, as well as coolants for electronic circuits. The dibromides and monobromides with X Br and Y F, or vice versa can be used in the medical field as radiations shields, or as flame proofing compounds more over, because of the high density due to the presence of bromine, they can be used as fluids for the filling of submarine cables, or as fluids for gyroscopes. The diiodides, as seen, constitute the starting materials for the production of the hereinabove mentioned halogenated compounds. The following Examples are supplied to the purpose of illustrating the present invention, and they are not to be intended as limitative of the application possibi lities thereof. Into a 250 ml Inconel autoclave 53 g 0.12 mol of I C₂F₄ ₂I obtained, according to known techniques, by telomerization of C₂F₄ with IC₂F₄I, and then 80 g 0.53 mol of C₃F₆ re charged. The mixture is heated at 200 C for 16 hours, under stirring. The pressure increases up to 50 abs.atm, and then progressively decreases, during the proceeding of the reaction, down to 40 abs.atm. After cooling, the excess of C₃F₆ is discharged, and 63 g are recovered of crude product, which is washed with a diluted solution of sodium thiosulphate. The organic layer is fractionated by rectification under 1 torr, with adiabatic column, and with reflux ratio 4 1. As lower boiling products, 26.5 g of product corresponding to the unreacted I C₂F₄ ₂I, and moreover two fractions, A and B, with boiling point of 42 C and 72 C respectively, in the amount of 28.5 and 7 g are collected. In the boiler 1 g remains of residual product. On the basis of the analytical data resulting from gas chromatographic analysis G.C. and from ¹⁹F N.M.R. CFCl₃, ppm , the A and B fractions result thus consti tuted With the same equipment and modalities as of Example 1, 36 g 0.079 mol of I C₂F₄ ₂ I and 90 g 0.6 mol of C₃F₆ are charged. The reaction mixture is progressive ly heated up to 220 C, a pressure of 70 abs.atm being reached, and the reaction is carried out until the pres sure decreases to 50 abs.atm the temperature is then adjusted at 240 C fqr 5 hours. The reaction mixture is then cooled, the gases are vented off and the product 55 g is recovered and washed with an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulphate. The fractionating is then carried out in a Spalt rohr Fischer equipment, and the following fractions are obtained On the basis of ¹⁹F N.M.R. data, the fraction 1 corresponds to the product A of Example 1, the fraction 2 is constituted by the two B.1 and B.2 isomers of Example 1, in the weight ratio B.1 B.2 1 8. The fraction 3 is constituted by The chemical shifts a, b, c, d, and e correspond respectively to a , b , c , d , e of compound B.2, and the chemical shifts f, g, h, i, l, m correspond respecti vely to e , f , h , l , g , m , of compound B.1. The residue in the boiler, identified by gas chroma tography and ¹⁹F N.M.R. is constituted by 60 of the compound containing 4 CF₂CF CF₃ units two isomers , and by 40 of practically pure compound containing 5 CF₂CF CF₃ units. With the modalities as disclosed in Example 1, and with the same equipment, 73.5 g 0.16 mol of I C₂F₄ ₂ I and 130 g 0.87 mol of C₃F₆ are reacted for 16 hours at 220 C. The reaction product is recovered as described in Example 1, it being obtained in the amount of 115 g. It results to be constituted by the following frac tions, obtained by means of fractional distillation The fraction 4 has been identified by N.M.R. analy sis. The chemical shifts are equal, apart from the inte gration, to the corresponding chemical shifts of the other peroducts already described in the foregoing Exam ples. The residue in the boiler, corresponding to 6.1 , is identified as an isomer mixture of molecular formula I C₂F₄ ₂ C₃F₆ ₄ I. Into a 250 ml Inconel autoclave, 21 g 0.028 mol of After 12 hours at 140 C, by operating as hereinabove described, 16 g of an organic phase is separated. On G.C., a main product is identified, constituting 98 of the whole product, the residual 2 being unreacted starting material. The product is purified as disclosed in Examples 1, by ¹⁹F N.M.R. analysis the product is identified to be Into a tubular reactor of 5 cm of diameter, provided with a porous membrane on the bottom, with traps and condensers and suitable measurement and control systems, 150 ml are introduced of trichlorotrifluoroethane sol vent, together with 22 g of the iodides obtained accord ing to Example 2, and enriched by distillation, so that such products consist by more of 90 of the compound corresponding to fraction 3. After spurging with N₂ and isotherming at O C, through the porous membrane a 2 1 by volume mixture of N₂ F₂ is flown at a flow rate of 3 l h. An initial colouring of the mixture, due to iodine, and an immediate decolouring due to the formation of iodine fluorides can be observed. At the same time, it can be observed also that, due to the exothermic charac ter of the reaction, the temperature inside the reactor increases up to 17 C. When then the temperature decreases again, pure fluorine is flown for a further hour. The product is neutralized with a 10 NaOH solution, and rectified. 14.1 g of perfluorinated product are iso lated. On the basis of G.C. and ¹⁹F N.M.R. data, the io dides used as the starting material, which have been completely fluorinated, result absent. The main product, with b.p. 194 C results to be Into a 50 ml autoclave of AISI steel, 15 g 0.025 mol of compound A of Exanple 1 and 20 g 0.125 mol of Br₂ are introduced. The mixture is heated at 150 C for 9 hours. After cooling, the crude product 11.8 g is reco vered and washed, first with a 10 KOH solution, and then with 5 sodium thiosulphate solution. The product is rectified b.p. 156 C . On gas chromatographic analysis, one peak only is observed which, on the basis of N.M.R. analysis chemical shifts and integration results to be Into a 50 ml autoclave of AISI steel, 24 g 0.04 mol of compound A of Example 1 and 12.8 g 0.08 mol of Br₂ are introduced. The mixture is heated at 150 C for 3 hours. After cooling, the crude product is recovered and washed, first with a 10 KOH solution, and then with a sodium thiosulphate solution. On gas chromatographic analysis, two peaks in the ratio 3 1 are evidenced, none of which corresponds to the diiodide used as the starting material, and of which the one with shorter retention time is identical to that of Example 6, and namely The product corresponding to the second peak is isolated by rectifying the reaction crude, and corres ponds to
