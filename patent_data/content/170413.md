# TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
In an information transmission system for use for inter node trunks, both circuit switched and packet switched traffic is handled, the former being given priority. The system uses successive equal length envelopes each providing a number of bits usable to provide a number of frames each usable for either sort of traffic. Circuit switched traffic has priority and uses frames at the beginnings of the envelopes, after which packets are handled. The envelope is of such a size that it provides frames for all circuit switched channels to be catered for, and in most cases the remainder of the envelope can handle packet traffic.
