# Dual mode drum brake.

## Abstract
In a drum brake assembly a pair of brake shoes 12, 14 are carried by a backing plate 10 and are engageable with the brake drum 18 to effect a service brake application. A parking lever 26 co operates with the pair of brake shoes 12, 14 to engage the shoes with the brake drum 18 and effect a parking brake application. A connector 34, 84, 94, 96 is slidably carried by the backing plate 10 and pivotally anchors at least one of the brake shoes 12, 14 to the backing plate. The connector 34, 84 or another structure 128 transmits braking torque from one brake shoe 12 to the other 14 only during a parking brake application. The connector is releasably secured to the backing plate in a fixed position by a latch 36, 88, 114 which is connected to the parking lever. Movement of the parking lever to a position effecting a parking brake application causes the latch to release the connector for sliding movement relative to the backing plate. When a service brake application is effected, the connector remains fixed to the backing plate and the brake functions as a non servo drum brake. When the parking brake is operated, the connector is released by the latch and is movable in the direction of brake drum rotation. Consequently, the brake functions as a servo drum brake during parking brake applications.
