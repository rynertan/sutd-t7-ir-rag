# Isocyanate coupled reinforced oxymethylene polymers made by using a catalyst system containing alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium saccharinate.

## Abstract
An improved oxymethylene polymer composition is provided which is comprised of a blocked or unblocked isocyanate, a synergistic blend of isocyanate catalysts con sisting of dibutyl tin dilaurate and at least one alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium saccharinate as defined and a reinforc ing agent. The presence of the blend of isocyanate catalysts enables satisfactory coupling to be achieved between the reinforcing agent and the oxymethylene polymer with a smaller amount of isocyanate coupling agent than would normally be required. In addition, a lessened amount of catalyst is required to achieve such a result.
