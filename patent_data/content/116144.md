# Thermal air flow meter.

## Abstract
A thermal air flow meter 1 consists essentially of a hollow cylindrical support 2 made of an insulating material, a heat sensitive resistor 7 formed on top of the support, and lead wires 3, 4 inserted into the hollow part 6 of the support from either end and bonded thereto by glass. This flow meter 1 measures the flow rate from changes in the resistance of the heat sensitive resistor with temperature. The ratio of the inner diameter d₂ of the support to the outer diameter d₃ of the lead wires d₂ d₃ is at least 1.7. This arrangement can provide a thermal air flow meter with a quick response to changes in flow rate.
