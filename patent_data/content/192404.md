# VACCINE, METHOD FOR ITS PREPARATION AND USE THEREOF IN VACCINATING HUMANS AGAINST ROTAVIRUS INFECTION

## Abstract
A live rotavirus vaccine against bovine and human rotaviruses comprising a strain of live bovine rotavirus which does not hemagglutinate primate red blood cells, gives at least about 20 fold higher titers when neutralized with antiserum therefor as compared to heterologous bovine or primate rotaviruses, and has a migration pattern of its RNA genome segments when determined by PAGE substantially as shown by lane WC3 in Figure 1, the strain of bovine rotavirus having been serially passaged in primate kidney tissue culture a sufficient number of times that when administered to humans the vaccine is immunogenic with out causing disease.
