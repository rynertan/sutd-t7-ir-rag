# Device for measuring tablet breaking force.

## Abstract
There is provided a device for measuring the force required to break a tablet, wherein the device comprises a tablet holding means 1 comprising a base 2 , a tablet splitting edge 6 in the base 2 and an area for holding a tablet 5 in an inclined cantilevered position such that at least a portion of the cantilevered segment of the tablet 5 extends over the tablet splitting edge 6 . Means 12, 13, 14 are provided for exerting a force substantially normal to a portion of the cantilevered segment of the tablet 5 extend ing over the splitting edge 6 to thereby create a moment of force about the tablet splitting edge 6 sufficient to break the tablet 5 . The device includes means for measuring the force required to break the tablet 5 .
