# Analogue to digital converter circuit.

## Abstract
By means of a controlled integrator, a noise component in the residual signal which is left after a conversion cycle of an analogue to digital converter can be eliminated for the major part. It is then possible to digitize this residual signal and thus to obtain additional bit information, as a result of which the range and the resolving power of the analogue to digital converter are increased.
