# Thermistor thermometer.

## Abstract
A thermistor thermometer has a reference resistance cor recting section for controlling the number of pulses of an oscil lation signal to a predetermined reference value. The oscillation signal is sampled in response to a measuring time signal at a reference temperature. The reference temperature is given as a predetermined temperature below a possible oprating tem perature range. The thermistor thermometer also has a sensi tivity correcting section for operating the thermometer for first and second operating intervals at different counting rates. The first and second operating intervals constitute a sampling peri od of the measuring time signal. The first and second operating intervals of the sensitivity correcting section are switched over in response to a reference count signal from a temperature counter. The tempeature counter counts the oscillation signals sampled in response to the measuring time signal and gener ates temperature data.
