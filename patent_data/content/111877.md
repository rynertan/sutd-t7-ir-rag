# A procedure for sorting a granular material and a machine for executing the procedure.

## Abstract
The procedure includes observation of each grain by optic electronic devices and consists of an initial stage during which several values, representing colour signals, are extracted and read and are then processed by a computer to reduce all the signals to two numbers only, defining a pair of coordinates on a plane where the colorimetric characteristics of the grains are represented, and of a second stage in which each grain is automatically classified within an electronic grid, associated to the above plane, wherein an operator has already assigned the squares for classes of unacceptable grains. The machine includes an analog to digital converter 2 able to convert the analog signals received from the observation devices into binary form, two adaptation circuits 3 , a computer 4 and a memory for controlling sampling and analog numerical conversion of the colour signals, also for storing all samples obtained, as well as for executing the above first and second stages of the procedure.
