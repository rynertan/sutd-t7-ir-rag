# Electrically controlled in line dispensing faucet.

## Abstract
An in line electrically operated dispensing faucet for fluids such as beer and other liquids. A reciprocatable plunger operates in a tubular means relative to a seat. Elec tromagnetic means are provided for reciprocating the plunger means. The plunger means has channels to provide for in line flow through it and through the tubular means between the inlet and outlet. In a second form of the inven tion, a second in line plunger is provided in the tubular means and a second electromagnetic means constructed to be powered by way of pulsating DC voltage so as to recipro cate the second plunger means is provided. The second plunger means is also of in line construction so that the flow is in line with the axis of the plunger means and with the tubular means. The second plunger is restrained by a spring and is able to engage the first plunger means so as to inter mittently interrupt flow through the first plunger means for purposes of creating foam within the tubular plunder means.
