## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 1,1,3,3 tetramethyl 2,3 dihydro 1 H isoindoles substituted in position 5 and or 6, of general formula EMI1.1 in which R can be H, an aryl containing up to 12 carbon atoms, or C R , R , RIV and R can be an aryl containing up to 12 carbon atoms or C E , R , RIV , where R and R represent methyl groups, and IvR represents an alkyl or an aryl containing up to 20 carbon atoms, which may be branched or bonded to heteroatoms which are inert under the reaction conditions, or 8E2 or OH groups which may be acylated or alkylated , or CN or COuRV, where ss represents an alkyl containing upto 4 carbon atoms consisting of reacting di tert propargylamine, HN C CH3 2C CH 2 with a R CEC R alkyne at a temperature between 0 and 1000C, in the presence of a catalyst constituted by a zerovalent nickel complex of formula lsiLns where n is 2, 3 or 4, and L represents a ligand constituted by olefins up to 10 carbon atoms and or phosphine derivatives of type P RVI 3, where the RVI groups, which can be equal or different, can be aryls containing up to 13 carbon atoms or alkyls containing up to 4 carbon atoms, or alkoxy groups containing up to 4 carbon atoms or aryloxy groups containing up to 8 carbon atoms.The catalyst can also be generated in situ by reducing nickel chloride with iron, zinc or manganese dust in the presence of thiourea, or by treating Raney nickel with a slight excess of thiourea over that necessary for developing hydrogen. The reaction can be conducted either in the absence of solvents or in ether or nitrile solvents having a boiling point less than 150 C. Nickel based catalysts are known to induce cyclotrinerisation in acetylenic compounds, with the formation of aromatic rings, but their catalytic activity in combining monoacetylenic with diacetylenic molecules was not known.J.A.C.S. 102, page 5245 1980 gives information regarding the activity, in selectively forming compounds deriving from a diacetylenic molecule and a monoacetylenic molecule, of certain cobalt complexes itich are not easily accessible, are of high cost, and are of considciabJe toxicity.It has now been found, and constitutes the subject matter of the present invention that zerovalent complexes such as Ni C6H5 P O i propyl 2 4 or Ni P O isopropyl 3 4, or Raney nickel treated with a slight excess of thiourea over that necessary for developing its active hydrogen, selectively catalyse the reaction between di tert riropargyl amine and monoacetylenic compounds to give isoindole derivatives with high yields, in accordance with the following scheme EMI2.1 The reaction between the two molecules takes place very easily, it being necessary only to mix the reagents and catalyst together to obtain the desired result.The diacetylenic amine and the monoacetylenic compound are introduced in a ratio which is equal to or less than 1 1 according to the acetylenic compound used. Generally, the preferred ratio is between 1 3 and 1 6.The products obtained can be separated from the reaction mixture by conventional methods, preferably by direct distillation.The products obtained are new chemical products which can be used as intermediates in organic synthesis for producing isoindole derivatives in awl fields of application. The groups R and R can serve for functionalisation with suitable groups for further reaction with various substrates and supports.Some illustrative examples are given hereinafter in order to further clarify the present invention.EXAMPLE 1 1 g G.71 mmoles of di tert propargylamine DTPA and 4 ml of 3 methyl 3 amino l butyne BAM are fed into a 25 ml flask under an inert atmosphere. 140 mg 0.145 mmoles of Ni PhP OiPr 2 4 are then added. As the reaction is very exothermic and could therefore proceed rather violently, the catalyst is added with caution, the reaction mixture being cooled with a water and ice bath. The low temperature is maintained until the solution has assumed a dark broom colour about one hour , after which it is heated by an oil bath to 7j 800C for 4 hours.It is allowed to cool to ambient temperature, and is hydrolysed, extracting with ethyl acetate.The organic extracts are dried over anhydrous Na2S04, and are subjected to gas chromatography analysis.The gas chromatography yield of the productEMI3.1 82 with respect to the fed DTPA, and the catalytic efficiency is 38 Moles of product per mole of catalyst,The DTPA conversion is 100 . The product, distilled in a bulb furnace 105 110 C, 2 2.5 mmHg after acid basic extraction of the reaction mixture, has a melting point of 63 65 C. EXAMPLE 2 1 g 6.71 mmoles of DTPA and 4 ml of BAM are reacted under the same conditions as Example 1 in the presence of 138 mg 0.155 moles ofNi P OiPr 3 4.After 4 hours at 75 800c, the reaction mixture is treated as in Example 1.The gas chromatography yield of the productEMI4.1 77 with respect to the fed DTPA, and the catalytic efficiency is 33 moles of product per mole of catalyst.The DTPA conversion is 100ss. EXAMPLE 3 0.906 g 6.08 mmoles of DTPA, 3.8 ml of BAM, and, under agitation, 170 mg 0.131 mmoles of Ni P OPh 3 4 are fed under an inert atmosphere into a 25 ml flask.Initially heterogeneous, the mixture is heated under agitation to 75 80 C by neans of an oil bath for 3 days. It is then allowed to cool to ambient temperature, hydrolysed, extracted with ethyl acetate, and subjected to gas chromatography analysiThe gas chromatography yield of the productEMI4.2 3 with respect to the fed DTPA, and the catalytic efficiency is 14 moles of product per mole of catalyst.The DTPA conversion is 40 . Analogous results are obtained by using Ni COD 2 or Ni PPh3 3 in place of Ni P OPh 3 4. EXAMPLE 4 0.45 ml of Raney nickel suspended in water are fed under an inert atmosphere into a 25 ml flask. Washing is carried out, and the solvent replaced with ethanol. 80 mg of thiourea are then added, followed by a furThe .80 mg after the ethanol has been replaced with acetonitrile about 3 m3 . When gas ceases to be evolved, 0,500 g 3.35 mmoles of DTPA and 2.5 ml of BAN are added again under agitation , and the mixture heated to 75 80 C by means of an oil bath for 5 days. it is allowed to cool, filtered, and the solid residue washed repeatedly with acetonitrile.The filtratc is hydrolysed and extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic extract, after drying over anbydrous Na2S 4, is subjected to gas chromatography analysisThe gas chromatography yield of the productEMI5.1 65 with respect to the fed DTPA. The DTPA conversion is 100 .The catalyst, after recovering from the reaction mixture and taking up in acetonitrile, has the same catalytic activity when again reacted under the same conditions. EXAMPLE 5 g g 4.05 mmoles of DTPA and 3.6 ml 32.8 mmoles of phenyl acetylene in 7 ml of tetrahydrofuran THF are reacted together in the presence of 94 mg 0.098 moles of Ni PhP OiPr 2 4 under the same conditions as Example 1.After 20 hours at ambient temperature, the reaction mixture is treated as in Example 1.The gas chromatography yield of the productEMI5.2 is 42 with respect to the fed DTPA, and the catalytic efficiency is 17 moles of product per mole of catalyst.The DTPA conversion is 100 , the balance being converted almost exclusively into the product of addition of two molecules of phenylacetylene.After acid basic extraction of the reaction mixture and distilling in a bulb furnace 118 1230C 0.4 0.5 mmHg , the product has a melting point of 53 54 C. EXAI 6 0.606g 4.06 mmoles of DTPA and 0.904 g 5.08 mmoles of diphenyl acetylene dissolved in 7 ml of THF are reacted together in the presence of 82 mg 0.085 mmoles of Ni PhP OiPr 2 4 under the same conditions as example 1.After 4 hours at 800C, the reaction mixture is treated as in Example 1.The gas chromatography yield of the productEMI6.1 is 63 with respect to the fed DTPA, and the catalytic efficiency is 30 moles of product per mole of catalyst.The DTPA conversion is 100 .The product is separated and purified as follows the reaction mixture is hydrolysed and extracted with ethyl ether or ethyl acetate. The organic extract is treated with dilute H2SO4 about 10 . A white solid separates at the interface, and is insoluble in both phases. It is filtered off, washed with ethyl ether and crystal3 ised from methanol or a mixture of ethanol and chiore benzene M.P. 215 216 . EXAMPLE 7 0.355 g 2.38 moles of DTPA and 2 ml of BAN are reacted together in the presence of 30 mg 0.23 mmoles of NiCl2, 73 mg of Zn dust and 50 mg of thiourea under the same reaction conditions as Example 1.After 3 days at 750C. the reaction mixture is treated as in Example 1.The gas chromatography yield of the productEMI6.2 17 with respect to the fed DTFA, and the catalytic efficiency is about 2 moles of product per mole of NiCl2 used.
