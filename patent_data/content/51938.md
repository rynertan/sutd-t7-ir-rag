# Video signal reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises an integrating drive circuit 4 for controlling the position of a rotary magnetic reproducing head 3 in the traverse direction of a skew recorded track formed on a magnetic tape 17 , a trace control circuit 8 for supplying a jump signal j to the drive circuit 4 which causes the magnetic head 3 to jump to the beginning of a track to be traced next on completion of each tranclng, a memory 21 for storing the output signal from the magnetic head 3 corresponding to at least one track tracing, and a memory reading and writing control circuit 22, 23 for writing the head output signal into the memory 21 only when the jump signal j is absent during slow motion or still picture reproduction, and for reading the stored head output out of the memory 21 repetitively.
