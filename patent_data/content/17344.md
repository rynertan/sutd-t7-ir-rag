# A direct drive high speed ultracentrifuge.

## Abstract
A direct drive system for a high speed ultra centrifuge. The drive spindle assembly 50 is removable through the rotor chamber without disturbing any vacuum seals 46, 64 that are present to isolate the requisite vacuum environment in the rotor chamber for high speed rotation. All of the high speed bearings 36, 40 are connected to the spindle assembly for removal as a unit. An induction motor 72 provides the direct drive with the motor armature mounted on the drive spindle assembly.
