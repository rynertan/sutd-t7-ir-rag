# SPIN CASTING TYPE FISHING REEL WITH IMPROVED DUAL CRANK BEARING RETENTION MEANS

## Abstract
A spin casting fishing reel 10 has a cylindrical body 20 with a transverse deck plate 21 and circumferential forward 22 and rearward 23 body portions with integral axially aligned hollow bosses 39 and 40 at opposite sides of the rearward reel body portion. There is a crank bearing sleeve 160 and 161 slidably mounted in each of the hollow bosses 39 and 40 , and a gear crank assembly 310 is journalled in the crank bearing sleeves 160 and 161 . A back housing 11 for the reel has a cylindrical cover 12 mating with the periphery of the rearward circumferential body portion 23 and is detachably secured to the body. Transversely extend ing interengaging parts 45, 46 and 164 on each of the hollow bosses 39 and 40 and on each crank bearing sleeve 160 and 161 fix the rotational orientation of the bearing sleeves in the bosses, and abutting surfaces 46, 47 and 165 limit inward movement of the sleeves in the bosses. An inwardly facing surface 51 or 52 on a rearward part of each hollow boss 39 or 40 and an outwardly facing surface 167 on a rearward part of each sleeve 160 or 161 form the outer and inner sides, respectively, of a rearwardly open recess, and a forwardly projecting web 19 at each side of the back housing 11 extends into one of the aforesaid rearwardly open recesses to restrict lateral outward movement of the crank bearing sleeves 160 and 161 .
