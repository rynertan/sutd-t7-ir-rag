# Oil resistant flame retardant compositions.

## Abstract
A fire retardant, oil resistant polymer composition includes an ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer blended with one or more of ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene ethyl acrylate, ethylene butyl acrylate or ethylene propylene diene monomor. The composition also contains a cross linking initiator and a hydrated metal oxide filler. The material may be used as a insulant coating on electrical or fibre optic cables.

## Description
OIL RESISTANT FLAME RETARDENT COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to halogen free, oil resistant, flame retardent, plastics compositions for coating electrical wires and cables and to methods of making such compositions. Flame retardent plastics compositions are employed extensively for the insulation and sheathing of electrical or fibre optic cables, particularly where such cables are used in industrial military applications where a fire can have serious consequences. The conditions in which such cables are installed frequently involve exposure to oil or chemical fluids e.g. shipboard applications. Under such conditions, conventional halogen free insulation and sheathing materials deteriorate quickly necessitating premature replacement. Where cables are intended for shipboard application they are installed at an early stage in the shipbuilding process. Thus it is generally impossible to effect replacement without a considerable amount of dismantling oE the vessel. It is therefore desirable that such cables are made of oil resistant materials to reduce or obviate the need for replacement. Conventional oil resistant plastics are generally halc.enated materials. Such materials may not burn on heating but they produce large quantities of toxic fumes an are thus quite unmitable for marine application. The object of the invention is to minimize or to overcome this disadvantage. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an electrical or fibre optic cable having a protective sheath of a fire retardent, oil resistant plastics composition, characterised in that the plastics comprises a cross linked copolymer blend of ethylene methyl acrylate EMA together with ethylene ethyl acrylate EEA , a thylene butyl acrylate EBA , ethylene propylene diene monomer or mixtures thereof. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a flame retardent, oil resistent plastics composition, including an ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer EMA blended with ethylene vinyl acrylate EVA , ethylene ethyl acetate EEA , ethylene butyl acrylate EBA , ethylene propylene diene monomer or mixtures thereof, a coupling agent, a cross linking agent, and a filler comprising a hydrated metal oxide, characterised in that the EMA copolymer comprises 50 to 95 weight percent of the total plastics blend, and that the filler comprises 80 to 250 weight percent of the plastics blend. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of making a flame retardant, oil resistant plastics composition, the method including 0 blending at a temperature below 160 C an ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer EMA together with, ethylene vinyl acetate EVA , ethylene ethyl acrylate EEA , ethylene butyl acrylate EBA , ethylene propylene diene monomer or mixtures thereof, a coupling agent, a non linking agent and a hydrated metal oxide filler, and pellitising and cross linking the blended composition. Typically the filler comprises trihydrated alumina or hydrated magnesium oxide. The composition may also contain a minor proportion of anti oxidants and lubricants. These additives do not significantly effect the fire retardent or oil resistant properties of the composition but are added to improve its service and handling properties. The composition may be used for coating both electrical and fibre optic cables. Typically we employ polymer blends having the following range of compositions all of which are given in parts by weight. EMA VAMAC 50 to 95 Other Copolymer s 5 to 50 Filler 80 to 250 Coupling agent 0.5 to 5 Antioxidant 0.1 to 3 Initiator 0.5 to 10 Lubricant 0.5 to 10 The constituent materials are compounded e.g. in a Banbury mixer or twin screw compounding extruder up to 0 a temperature of 160 C and may then be pelletised for subsequent use as feed stock for extrusion on to an electrical cable. Best properties are obtained from cable coatings that are radiation cross linked using an electron beam or cobalt source but an alternative chemical cross linking could be achieved by the incorporation of a suitable peroxide in the formulation in the ratio of 0.1 to 5 parts by weight per hundred parts of polymer. Cross linking can then be achieved using conventional vulcanisation techniques. Typically we employ a silane or titanate coupling agent, methacrylate initiator and a phenolic antioxidant but other conventional materials can of course be employed. The lubricant may comprise a stearate or oleate. By way of example the following composition was prepared EMA Vamac N123 70 EVA 30 Alumina trihydrate 150 Phenolic Antioxidant 2 Silane coupling agent 2 Stearate lubricant 1.5 Methacrylate Initiator 5 The material was compounded as previously described, cross linked and then tested to MODSpecification NES 518. The material had a measured oxygen index of 33 and a temperature index of 300. Exposure to diesel fuel and lubricating oils produced a volume swelling of 15 over a period of 28 days at 508. Salt water under similar conditions produced a swelling of less than 5 . This compares favourably with conventional flame retardant materials which typically display a swelling of 100 to 150 in oils.
