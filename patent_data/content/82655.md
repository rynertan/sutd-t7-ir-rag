# Systems and methods for processing physiological signals.

## Abstract
Systems and methods are disclosed for detecting the recurrence of physiological functions. The disclosed systems and methods are especially adapted for detecting the recurrence of a patient s respiration from a signal representative of changes in the patient s thoracic volume, despite the presence of cardiovascular artifact in the signal.
