A valve refacing tool having a sleevelike housing, and a substantially cylindrical support disposed within and remov ably fixed to the housing. This cylindrical support has a small diameter cylindrical opening which extends axially from the inner end thereof, and which communicates with the small diameter end of a truncated conical recess which opens outwardly through the other axial end thereof. This conical recess accommodates the head of a poppet valve. A plurality of cutting blades are secured in angularly spaced relationship around the conical recess. The cylindrical sup port is split into a plurality of separable arcuate sectors, and each is individually fixedly but releasably secured to the housing.
