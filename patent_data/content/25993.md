# Fibroin coated pigment and processes for producing same.

## Abstract
A fibroin coated pigment and two processes for produc ing the same are disclosed. The fibroin coated pigment com prises a carrier pigment in the form of finely divided particles whose surfaces are substantially coated with a film of regen erated fibroin and is characterized in that at least 50 by weight of the regenerated fibroin is constituted of hot water insoluble fibroin having the Î² configuration. One of the pro cesses comprises the steps of dissolving a degummed silk material in at least one solvent selected from the group con sisting of an aqueous cupri ethylenediamine solution, an aqueous ammoniacal solution of cupric hydroxide, an aque ous alkaline solution of cupric hydroxide and glycerol, an aqueous lithium bromide solution, an aqueous solution of the chloride, nitrate or thiocyanate of calcium, magnesium or zinc, and an aqueous sodium thiocyanate solution dispersing a carrier pigment in the resulting fibroin solution having a fibroin concentration of from 3 to 20 by weight adding a coagulating salt to the pigment loaded fibroin solution to coagulate and precipitate the fibroin dehydrating and drying the resulting coagulum and then pulverizing the dried pro duct. The other process comprises the steps of dissolving a degummed silk material in a solvent as defined above dialyz ing the resulting fibroin solution dispersing a carrier pigment in the resulting aqueous fibroin solution having a fibroin con centration of from 3 to 20 by weight subjecting the pigment loaded aqueous fibroin solution to at least one treatment for coagulating and precipitating the fibroin, the treatment being selected from the group consisting of the addition of the coagulating salt, aeration, coagulation at the isoelectric point, exposure to ultrasonic waves, and agitation at high shear rate dehydrating and drying the resulting coagulum and then pulverizing the dried product. The fibroin coated pigment thus obtained is particularly useful as a pigment or additive for cosmetic preparations and coating compositions.
