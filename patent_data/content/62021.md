# A DEVICE FOR ARMING A FUZE FOR A PROJECTILE

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a pressure sensitive device for arming a fuze for a projectile. It is previously known to mount on projectiles various kinds of diaphragms or pistons with sealing piston rings for this purpose. However these devices often have an unsatis factory function. The invention involves a solution to the problem by having a piston mounted in the projectile wall, in sealing contact with a sleeve made of softer material than the piston. When exposed to a high outer gas pressure the piston is pushed into the sleeve and deforms it during which a very good sealing is maintained. The movement of the piston is used to carry out a predetermined arming measure.
