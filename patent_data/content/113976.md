# Method for attaching elastic band to sanitary articles.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method for attaching an elastic band to sanitary articles such as disposable diapers. The elastic band is cut into predetermined lengths which are then intermittently attached by adhesive to a web forming said articles. Said eleastic band is severed on a surface of a rotary suction drum so that the respective lengths thus sev ered and isolated may be intermittently attached to said web. Said elastic band may comprise a plurality of rela tively narrow or fine rubber strands. Particularly, in such a case, said elastic band is attached to a support tape wider than said elastic band and having high flexibility before cut ting so that these rubber strands may be reliably held on the surface of said suction drum.
