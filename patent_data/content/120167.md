# Electrically activatable recording element and process.

## Abstract
An electrically activatable recording EAR element cap able of producing a positive image comprises an electrically activatable recording layer comprising a transition metal complex selected from the group consisting of Group VIII and Group IB metal complexes in a film forming ionic polymer upon exposure to electric current, development of an image in the exposed areas of the recording layer is restricted. The recording element is light handleable and provides a non silver positive image upon exposure and processing.
