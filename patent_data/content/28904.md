# Multi layered, fiberglass reinforced floor covering systems and method of making them.

## Abstract
This invention discloses mutlilayered, fiberglass reinforced floor covering systems which provide such highly desired properties as chemical resistance, abrasion resis tance, low temperature curing, thermal shock resistance and the capability of bridging shrinkage cracks, control joints and the like. One particularly desirable application of the floor constructions of this invention is in the pharmaceutical and food industry. This application is based upon the fact that the floor constructions provided are stain resistant, color stable, and do not permit the growth of fungi or bacteria. The multi layered floor constructions of the present invention comprise in ascending laminated form a floor subs trate such as a porous concrete floor, a primer coat of an epoxy resin, a fiberglass reinforced base coat of an epoxy resin, a top coat of an epoxy resin containing filler material, and a sealer coat of a polyurethane resin.
