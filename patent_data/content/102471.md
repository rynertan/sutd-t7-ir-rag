# Stepping motor driving circuit.

## Abstract
A stepping motor driving circuit includes a plurality of switching transistors TR1 to TR4 having their emitter collector paths connected to the corresponding ends of motor coils L1 to L4 , a plurality of diodes D1 to D4 having their anodes connected to the above mentioned ends of the motor coils L1 to L4 and their cathodes connected to a common terminal, and a braking circuit 2 connected between the cathode of the diodes D1 to D4 and the other end of the motor coils L1 to L4 , in which the switching transistors TR1 to TR4 are sequentially turned ON to permit excitation currents to pass through the corresponding motor coils L1 to L4 . The braking circuit 2 has a variable effective impedance.
