# Production of PVC irrigation pipe.

## Abstract
Process for producing flexible PVC irrigation pipe by extruding a plasticised PVC composition containing a melt strength enhancing aid and a chemical blowing agent and a the extruded melt being expanded by foaming thereof immediately on leaving the die into a substantially closed cell extrudate of outer diameter greater than the die orifice with the extrudate surfaces being substantially unpunctured, b drawing down the extrudate in the atmosphere causing rupturing of the foam cell walls of the extrudate to form a substantially open cell extrudate having punctured surfaces, and c when the extrudate has been drawn down to a degree which is prior to any cellular collapse which would lead to the formation of water impervious pipe, cooling the extru date by passing it through a cooling means in order to prevent said collapse. Preferably the extrudate passes through a tubular guide into a water bath in step c . The pipe thus produced is suitable for irrigation applications and may be used for long periods without exhibiting an unacceptable decrease in water permeability.
