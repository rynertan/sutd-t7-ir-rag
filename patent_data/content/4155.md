# A wheel hub for a spoked wheel and use thereof.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a hub 1 for a spoked wheel, comprising a hub shell 11 having at opposite axial ends thereof a pair of opposed hub flange means 12 and a hub shaft 10 for rotatably supporting said hub shell 11 with a pair of bearing means 14, 15 disposed between said hub shaft 10 and hub shell 11 each of said hub flange means 12 having a plurality of spoke apertures 13 each extending generally parallel to the axis of said hub shell 11 , said plurality of spoke apertures 13 being arranged generally concentrically with respect to the axis of said hub shell 11 . In order to facilitate assembly of the spoked wheel and avoid distortion of the spokes, the plurality of spoke apertures 13 is provided in the form of a first group 13a and a second group 13b of spoke apertures axially displaced relative to each other, successive ones of said first and second groups 13a, 13b alternating with each other. The invention also provides a spoked wheel incorporating a hub of the invention.
