# Resistor compositions.

## Abstract
The invention is directed to a thick film resistor composi tion for firing in a low oxygen containing atmosphere comprising finely divided particles of a an anion deficient semiconductive material consisting essentially of a refrac tory metal nitride, oxynitride or mixture thereof and b a nonreducing glass having a softening point below that of the semiconductive material dispersed in c organic medium and to resistor elements made therefrom.
