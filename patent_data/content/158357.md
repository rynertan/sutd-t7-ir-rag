# Method of forming resist micropattern.

## Abstract
A resist pattern 17 is formed on a substrate 11 by forming a resist 12 on a substrate and radiating an energy beam carrying predetermined pattern information onto the resist 12 , thereby forming a recessed pattern 13 in a surface portion of the resist 12 so as not to extend through the resist 12 . A flat mask layer 14 is formed on the resist 12 including the recessed pattern 13 . The mask layer 15 is uniformly etched along a direction of thickness thereof until at least a surface of the resist 12 is exposed to allow the mask layer 14 to remain on at least a bottom of the recessed pattern 13 , thereby forming a mask pattern 16 comprising the remaining residual mask layer. Finally, the resist 12 is etched by using the mask pattern 16 as an etching mask.
