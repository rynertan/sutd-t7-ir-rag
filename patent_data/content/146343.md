# Control system for luminance chrominance signal processing circuits.

## Abstract
A color television receiver includes AKB control circuits operative during periodically recurring kinescope bias control intervals for automatically adjusting the cathode biases of the receiver s color kinescope. To ensure the integrity of the bias adjustment operations undertaken by the AKB control circuits, the receiver is provided with a control system which includes A keyed luminance chrominance gain control ap paratus 55 , serving to effectively disable luminance and chrominance signal amplifiers during each kinescope bias control interval B keyed brightness control apparatus 71 for rendering the DC levels of color signal inputs to the re ceiver s kinescope drivers independent of the receiver s brightness control adjustment throughout each kinescope bias control interval and C a control loop 141 156 for con trolling the DC level of the receiver s luminance channel out put, which opposes departures of one of said color signal inputs from equality with a reference voltage throughout each kinescope bias control interval. A retrace blanking circuit 51 , otherwise supplying beam cut off biases to the kinescope cathodes during periods of beam retrace, is prevented from such cut off bias application during beam retrace periods falling within the kinescope bias control intervals.
