# PHOTOCOMPOSING APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
Apparatus and methods for photocomposing as, for example, phototypesetting utilize photographic film on a moving member such as a rotatable cylinder with an array of multitudinous light emitting diodes movable along the length of the cylinder to project to the film an image of graphic information to be recorded on the film. The array moves to scan the film with overlap between one scan and the next to merge images of one scan into images of the next scan with a minimum of discontinuity. Overlapping ex posures from individual LEDs further increases sharpness of image and substantially eliminate variations from non uniformities of the individual LEDs.
