# INJECTION BLOCK STRUCTURE FOR FEEDING MOLTEN THERMOPLASTIC MATERIAL INTO MOLDS

## Abstract
The injection block structure for feeding molten ther moplastic material into molds, comprises modular elements 1,2,2a,3,3a,4,5 in mutually interchangeable association channels 6 , extend through the interiors of the modular elements 1,2,2a,3,3a,4,5 and are adapted for directing the molten thermoplastic material to the molds. In combination with the modular elements 1,2,2a,3,3a,4,5 , means of heating 7,8 the thermoplastic material are provided, which are hou sed within the channels 6 .
