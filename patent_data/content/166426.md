# Bimetal steam trap.

## Abstract
A bimetal steam trap is disclosed, which includes a tem perature responsive valve arrangement and a bimetallic column 24 formed of a plurality of pairs of bimetallic discs which are superposed with each other. The valve arrange ment has a valve element 20 normally biased by a spring 18 toward its open position, which biasing force is over come by the thermal expansion axial thrust generated by the bimetallic column 24 when condensation temperature within the steam trap is above a predetermined level. To permit an axial displacement of the valve element 20 in precise alignment with associated valve opening, an elon gate valve member 19 is provided at one end with the valve element 20 , and serves to support the bimetallic col umn 24 as an integrated sub assembly.
