# Scroll type fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
A scroll type fluid displacement apparatus including a housing 10 , a pair of scrolls 20,21 each comprising an end plate 201, 211 and a spiral wrap 202, 212 projecting from one surface of the end plate 201, 211 . Both wraps 202, 212 interfit to make a plurality of line contacts to define sealed off fluid pockets, and a driving mechanism 19, 14, 29 is operatively connected to one 21 of the scrolls to effect the orbital motion thereof relative to the other scroll 20 while rotation of the scroll 21 is prevented. The center portion of at least one of the wraps 202, 212 has height higher portion than the remaining portion thereof. The center portion extends substantially from the inner end of the spiral element 202, 212 outwardly at least throughout the por tions thereof which forms the center high pressure space when the two innermost pair of fluid pockets are merged into a single fluid pocket to form the high pressure space near the center of the scroll 20, 21 . This construction prevents the abnormal wear between wrap 202, 212 and opposite end plate 211, 201 which is caused by axial slant of the scroll 20, 21 or interior of extent parallelism between both scrolls 20, 21 without influence the sealing of the high pressure space.
