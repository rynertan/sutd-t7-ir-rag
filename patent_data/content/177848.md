# LSI MICROPROCESSOR CHIP WITH BACKWARD PIN COMPATIBILITY AND FORWARD EXPANDABLE FUNCTIONALITY

## Abstract
A chip implemented in new technology is designed to in clude expandable levels of new functionality. The chip includes compatibility circuits which connect to a number of pins which are unused in the chip it replaces in an existing computer sys tem. The compatibility circuits connect to those internal parts of the new chip that contain the newly added or altered levels of functionality. The new chip is installed in the existing com puter system just as the prior chip. When so installed, the com patibility circuits enable the new chip to operate in the same manner as the replaced chip but at high speed and with im proved performance. When the new chip is installed in the sys tem for which it was designed, the compatibility circuits enable the chip to operate with a selectable level of new functionality at the same higher speed and improved performance.
