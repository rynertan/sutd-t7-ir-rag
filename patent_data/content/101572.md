# Positive selection sorting of cells.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for positive selection of viable cells based upon differing chemical or physical properties or dynamic processes using a focussed radiant energy beam, such as a laser beam 11 to kill unwanted cells or to isolate wanted cells is described. The apparatus includes microscope means 14 and cell detection means 27 for identifying the cells to be killed or saved and attenuator means 12 for modifying the beam to prevent destruction of cells to be saved.
