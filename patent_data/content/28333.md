# Data processing apparatus having a pair of units interconnected in a master slave relationship.

## Abstract
In data processing apparatus, a master unit 10 is coupled to a start unit 14 via an attachment unit 12 the operation of which is controlled by tag out signals transmit ted on bus 32 from the master unit to the slave unit. Two complementary tag out patterns define, respectively a dis connected null and a connected null. All operations proceed in a predetermined sequence from either of the two nulls. The two units interchange signals indicating the intercon necting state that is, both units supply the null signal simultaneously except when there is a desire by one of the units to change to another operational state. Unique status recovery procedures and apparatus are disclosed that enable recovery of status and emergency control of units during error prone or degraded operations. All of the functions are based upon an encoded set of tag signals being exchanged. For reliability purposes, complementary tag signal combina tions provide diverse functions.
