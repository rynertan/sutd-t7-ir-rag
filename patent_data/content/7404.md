## Description
Tetrahydronaphthalene Synthesis This invention relates to techniques for synthesizing precursors of doxorubicin and related compounds such as daunmycin and carminomycin, and the aglycones thereof.More specifically, the present invention pertains to a technique for synthesizing 5,8 dialkoxy 2 hydroxy 2 acetyl1,2 ,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene and 5,8 dibenzyloxy 2 hydroxy 2 acetyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene, which compounds may be converted into anthracycline antibiotics, such as daunomycin and doxorubicin, using established techniques. Doxorubicin is a known anthracycline antibiotic described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 3,590,028. Doxorubicin, and the closely related compound daunomycin, are antineoplastic agents of established clinical utility. Doxorubicin hydrochloride, available from Adria Laboratories, Inc., under the trade name Adriamyci has been approved by theUnited States Food and Drug Administration for use in clinical research, and is one of the most powerful anticancer drugs available against numerous forms of cancer. At present, doxorubicin is produced commercially from a soil fungus by a fermentation process. Such techniques are inherently expensive and limit the types of molecules that can be produced. Because of the inherent disadvantages of presently available commercial techniques for producing doxorubicin and related compounds, substantial effort has been devoted to developing processes for producing such com pounds by chemical synthesis. Techniques for the synthesis of anthracycline antibiotics such as doxorubicin and daunomycin are known. See, e.g., Wong et al, Canadian Journal of Chemistry, Vol. 51, page 466 1973 Acton et al, Journal of Medicinal Chernistry, Vo. 17, c. 6, page 659 1973j ende et al, Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 97, No. 15, page 4425 1975 and Vol. 98, No. 7, page 1967 1976 Sih et al, Tetrahedron Letters, page 3385 1976 Swenton et al,Tetrahedron Letters, page 2383 1977 and Kelly et al,Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 99, page 5513 1977 . None of the known techniques for the total synthesis of anthracycline antibiotics such as daunomycin and doxorubicin have yet been proven to be commercially successful.Because of the demand for, and scarcity of, these compounds, a suitable synthesis technique is highly desired. The present invention provides a suitable synthesis technique by providing precursors for synthesizing daunomycin and related compounds, which may be prepared from readily available and inexpensive starting materials. In accordance with the present invention, 5,8 dialkoxy 2 hydroxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene or 5,8 dibenzyloxy 2 hydroxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene are oxidized to produce 5,8 dialkoxy 2 keto 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene or 5,8 dibenzyloxy 2 keto 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene. These latter compounds are reacted with the lithium salt of methylvinyl ether to produce the desired 5,8 dialkoxy 2 hydroxy 2 acetyl l,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene or 5,8 di benzyloxy 2 hydroxy 2 acetyl l,2,3 ,4 tetrahydronaphthalene. The sequence of reactions described above provides a novel and convenient method for the preparation of 5,8dialkoxy or 5,8 dibenzyloxy 2 hydroxy 2 acetyl l,,3 ,4 tetrahydronaphthalene, which compounds are useful intermediates in the synthesis of doxorubicin, daunomycin, carminomycin, 4 demethoxydaunomycin and related anti tumour agents and their aglycones in accordance with established techniques such as those disclosed in, e.g., C. M. Wong et al,Canadian Journal of Chemistry, Vol. 49, page 2712 1971 Vol. 51, page 466 1973 and F. Arcamone et al, CancerTreatment Reports, Vol. 60, page 829 1976 . In the synthesis of the present invention, 5,8 alkoxyor 5,8 benzyloxy 2 hydroxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene is used as a starting material. These compounds may be prepared by allowing commercially available and inexpensive butadiene and p benzoquinone to react under the normal conditions of the Diels Alder reaction See O. Diels andK. Alder, Ber., 62, page 2337 1929 to give the well known adduct 1,4 ,4a,5,8,8a cis hexahydro 5,8 dioxonaphthalene of the following formula EMI3.1 Alkylation, with a C1 C6 alkyl group, or benzylation under alkaline conditions produces the non conjugated dihydronaphthalene derivates of the following formula EMI3.2 in which R represents an alkyl group of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a benzyl moiety.These compounds can be referred to as 5,8 dialkoxy 1,4 dihydronaphthalene or 5,8 dibenzyloxy 1,4 dihydronaphthalene. Hydration of the double bond, as for example under hydroboration oxidation conditions, produces the desired tetrahydronaphthol compounds used as starting materials in the process of the present invention. The 5,8 dialkoxy 2 hydroxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene or 5,8 dibenzyloxy 2 hydroxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene compounds have the formula EMI3.3 in which R represents an alkyl group of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a benzyl moiety. The compounds of formula 3 are oxidized, preferably with pyridinium chlorochromate, to produce 5,8 alkoxy 2keto 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene or 5,8 dibenzyloxy 2keto 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene having the formula EMI4.1 where R is as previously defined. The compound of formula 4 where R is CH3 is known. See T. R. Lewis et al, Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 74, page 5321 1952 and G. Stork et al, ibid., Vol. 94, page 4735 1972 . The method described above of preparing the ketones of formula 4 is more efficient than the methods recorded in the literature e.g., A. P. Tarentev and P. P. Shavolova, J. Gen. Chem. U.S.S.R., Vol. 15, page 142 1945 T . R. Lewis,W. B. Dickinson and S. Archer, Journal of the AmericanChemical Society, Vol. 74, page 5321 1952 . Reaction of the ketone of formula 4 with the lithium salt of methylvinyl ether, followed by acidic work up, produces the desired 5,8 dialkoxy or 5,8 dibenzyloxy 2 hydroxy 2 acetyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene compounds having the formulaEMI4.2 in which R is as previously defined. The compounds of formula 5 where R is CH3 are also known see C. M. Wong et al,Canadian Journal of Chemistry, Vol. 49, page 2712 1971 and Vol. 51, page 466 1973 . The compounds of formula 5 may be converted to anthracycline antibiotics, such as doxorubicin, daunomycin, carminomycin, and 4 demethoxydaunomycin, and their aglycones by known techniques. For example, C. M. Wong et al, Canadian Journal of Chemistry, Vol. 51, page 466 1973 , discloses a technique for synthesizing daunomycinone, the aglycone of daunomycin, from 5,8 dimethyl 2 hydroxy 2 acetyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene the compound of formula 5, where R is CH3 . While the technique disclosed inWong et al specifically employs the 5,8 dimethyl compound, any of the other compounds of formula 5 i.e., where R is benzyl or C2 C6 alkyl can be used in place of the 5,8dimethyl compound for producing daunomycinone by the Wong et al technique. Aglycones, such as daunomycinone, may be converted to the corresponding anthracycline antibiotic, e.g., daunomycin, by attaching daunosamine to the aglycone. Techniques for attaching daunosamine to the aglycones are disclosed inActon et al, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 17, No. 6 page 659 1974 , and Smith et al, Journal of the AmericanChemical Society, Vol. 98, No. 7, page 1969 1976 . The following examples further illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention. The examples should in no way be considered limiting, but are merely illustrative of the various features of the present invention. Example 1 5,8 Dimethoxy 2 hydroxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene 2.4 g. was dissolved in methylene chloride 20 ml. and added in one portion to a suspension of pyridinium chlorochromate 5.2 g. in methylene chloride 20 ml. . After stirring at room temperature for 3 hours, the reaction mixture was diluted with dry ether 100 ml. and stirred until the sticky precipitate was transformed into a crisp solid about 15 min. .

The yellow solution on warming 0 up to 5 C. during 1 2 hr. became colorless.This solution of methoxyvinyllithium was then cooled to 70or. and a solution of 5,8 dimethoxy 2 keto 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene 0.5 g. in dry THF 25 ml. was added at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture did not exceed 550C. The solution was allowed to warm up to OOC. during 1 hr. After the addition of 0.5 ml. acetic acid, most of the solvents were evaporated from the reaction mixture. The residue was diluted with water and extracted with ether. The ether extract was washed 3 times with water, dired overNa2SO4 and evaporated.
