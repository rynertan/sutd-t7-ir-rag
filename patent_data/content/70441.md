# Extractive distillation process for the production of fuel grade alcohols.

## Abstract
A novel composition, and extraction process for the dehydration of a hydrated aliphatic, monohydric alcohol to produce a fuel grade alcohol. A select group of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts are added to and dissolved within a low volatility polyhydric alcohol to form a solution or solvent extractant, and said solvent extractant contacted and dissolved within said aliphatic, monohydric hydrated alcohol, the solvent extractant distilled, condensed, and dehyrated fuel grade aliphatic monohydric fuel grade alco hol recovered.
