# 2,3,4 TRIACYLHEXOSES AND MIXTURES THEREOF

## Abstract
The present invention comprises a new class of 2,3,4 tri O acylhexoses and mixtures thereof. Members of the new class of compounds are comprised of a hexose sugar having fatty acids attached at the 2, 3 and 4 positions of the hexose moiety. The fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated, and can have a relative molecular size of up to C₃₀. When at least one of the acylating fatty acid groups on the hexose molecule contains more than 7 carbons, the resulting 2,3,4 tri O acyl hexoses or mixtures thereof have a non bitter taste. On the other hand, when none of the acylating fatty acids have more than 7 carbons, the resulting 2,3,4 tri O acylhexoses and mixtures that contain them are bitter when tasted. The new 2,3,4 tri O acylhexoses can be synthesized using known chemical methods. Alternatively, the new compounds, and especially mix tures thereof, are obtained as the result of selective extraction and purification of the epicuticular exudate from Lycoper sicon pennellii plant parts. Mixtures of 2,3,4 tri O acyl hexoses, especially as found in the Lycopersicon pennellii natural plant extract, or the glucolipid fraction thereof, are useful as evaporation suppressants, antitranspirants and antidesiccants. The Lycopersicon pennellii natural plant ex tract is also useful as an ingredient in cosmetic and toiletry for mulations, while the non bitter glucolipid subfraction is es pecially useful as a low calorie substitute for fats in foods.
