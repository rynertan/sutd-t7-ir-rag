## Description
A co pending application entitled Discharge Lamp Operating Apparatus and Method filed August 10, 1984 and bearing US Serial No. 639,608 relates to a process and apparatus for starting and operating discharge lamps of increased light output from a given voltage source. Also, a co pending application entitled Metal Vapour Lamp Having Low Starting Voltage bearing US Serial No. 643,948 relates to a metal vapour lamp including a starting aid and providing enhanced light output from a lamp operated from a voltage source having a given output capability. The invention relates to a metal vapour lamp starting an operating apparatus having the features of the generic clause of claim 1. Such an apparatus is disclosed in US A 4 119 886. Specially, the manufacturing of a new dielectric ceramic for a non linear condensor is disclosed in this reference. The dielectric element forms together with an inductor element a pulse generator. In DE A 29 49 074 and FR A 80 24 976 other pulse generators using an inductor element and a non linear dielectric element are disclosed. The dielectric elements are manufactured of dielectric ceramics different to US A 4 119 886. According to these references the use of various dielectric ceramics and non linear dielectric elements and their cooperation with an inductive element is taught which are used to improve the starting of metal vapour lamps. Generally, discharge lamps operable from 50 or 60 Hertz alternating current voltage sources emit radiation in the visible region of the spectrum. These discharge lamps may be in the form of high intensity discharge metal vapour lamps such as metal vapour, metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps for example. Normally, the discharge lamp has a negative volt ampere characteristic and the current of such a plasma will tend to continually increase in magnitude if not restrain by a current limiter or ballast in series connection with the lamp. Typcially, metal vapour discharge lamps employed with a series connected inductive ballast are selected to have a voltage operational value substantially equal to about 50 of the rms value of a voltage source. Thus, a lamp operable from a 120 volt AC voltage source would have a design center voltage of about 52 volts and this voltage could rise as much as 25 volts over the life of the discharge lamp. However, this increase in operational voltage will undesirably reach a level whereat the voltage source no longer provides a potential sufficient to sustain operation of the lamp and the lamp is undesirably extinguished. One known technique employed to increase this potential available to the discharge lamp is a step up transformer and a fixed capacitor. In such apparatus, the source potential is stepped up to a higher value whereby the level of potential whereat the lamp is extinguished is raised to a higher level than was previously available. Unfortunately, transformers are expensive, cumbersome and heavy which adds a multitude of undesirable features to the apparatus. Another known apparatus for improving the operation of a ballast and discharge lamp is suggested in U.S. Patent No. 3,996,495 issued to Herman on December 7, 1976 and bearing the title High Efficiency Ballast System For Electric Discharge Lamps . Therein, a non linear capacitor is connected to a conventional high resistance transformer and allegedly improves the lamp current crest factor. Thus, lamp efficiency is reportedly improved because of an improved lamp current crest factor. In this manner, lamp current can be reduced without loss of light output. However, starting and maintaining ignition of increased wattage lamps remains a problem. Another known apparatus suggesting improved starting and operating of fluorescent lamps is proposed in U.S. Patent No. 4,079,292 issued to Kaneda on March 14, 1978. Therein, an oscillation booster circuit is utilized to provide reignition energy to a discharge lamp in each half cycle of an AC power source. Thus, a relatively small inductor ballast may be utilized in conjunction with a relatively high voltage discharge lamp. However, auxiliary booster oscillator circuitry as well as the switching circuitry associated therewith are obvious disadvantages in so far as apparatus cost are concerned. Additionally. United Kingdom Patent No. 2,066,801 A published 15 July 1981 and issued to TDK Electronics Company, Ltd. suggests a non linear dielectric element, the composition thereof, and a circuit utilizing the device with a lamp and a relatively complex preheating circuit for starting a lamp. Primarily, fabrication of this non linear dielectric element is discussed and claimed. Still another apparatus is suggested in an application bearing U.S. Serial No. 639,608 entitled Discharge Lamp Operating Apparatus And Method filed August 10, 1984 and assigned to the Assignee of the present application. Therein, a discharge lamp starting and operating apparatus includes a discharge lamp having an operating voltage not less than about 75 of the rms value of a voltage source. Therein, a fluorescent lamp shunted by a non linear dielectric element and coupled by an inductive ballast to a pair of terminals connectable to the voltage source. It is the object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for operating electric discharge lamps by which the efficiency is improved when the discharge lamp system is operated from a given service voltage source, by which the percentage of the supply voltage available to the discharge lamp is increased and the operational potential of the discharge lamp is increased. This object is solved by a low wattage metal vapor discharge lamp starting and operating apparatus having the features of claim 1. Preferred embodiments are disclosed in the dependent claims. For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects, advantages and capabilities thereof, reference is made to the following disclosure and appended claims in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Referring to the drawings, a low wattage metal vapor discharge lamp starting and operating apparatus is illustrated in FIG. 1. Therein, a pair of terminals, 5 and 7 respectively, are formed for connection to a low voltage source such as a 120 volt AC source for example. An inductive ballast 9 is connected to one 5 of the pair of terminals 5 and 7. Also, a metal vapor discharge lamp 11, which may be in the form of a mercury vapor discharge lamp, a metal halide discharge lamp or a high pressure sodium lamp for example, is connected to the inductive ballast 9 and to the other one 7 of the pair of terminals 5 and 7. Shunted across the metal vapor discharge lamp 11 is a non linear dielectric element 13 in the form of a non linear capacitor for example. As to operation, it has been previously mentioned that the usual apparatus associated with the starting and operating of metal arc type discharge lamps includes a discharge lamp designed for operation at about 50 of the rms line voltage available. Also, it has been mentioned that the lamp voltage tends to undesirably increase over the life period of the lamp such that this increase in lamp voltage reaches a value which is greater than the potential available from the line or voltage source whereupon the lamp is extinguished. It should be further noted that the voltage necessary for starting conduction and for continuing or maintaining conduct ion of a metal vapor discharge lamp is dependent upon the plasma of the particular lamp. Decay of the plasma conductivity occurs during the non conductive period of the lamp. Thus, the time period during which the lamp is non conductive affects the potential and time necessary to make the discharge lamp again conductive. Referring to FIG. 2 of the drawings, therein is illustrated the voltage Curve A and current Curve B waveforms of a low wattage metal vapor discharge lamp starting and operating apparatus of the prior art. More specifically, the apparatus includes an inductive ballast and metal vapor discharge lamp but does not include a non linear dielectric element. Accordingly, it can be seen that it takes about 750 usec after polarity reversal before current flows in the discharge lamp in accordance with the potential available for effecting conductivity of the discharge lamp. In contrast thereof, FIG. 3 illustrates the results of the low wattage metal vapor discharge lamp starting and operating apparatus of the invention. Utilizing the same discharge lamp, a 70 watt high pressure sodium lamp, in both instances but including a non linear dielectric element 13 shunting the discharge lamp, the illustrated voltage Curve C and current Curve D waveform are obtained. As can readily be seen, the voltage Curve C has been enhanced and importantly, current conduction Curve D is effected within a period of about 300 usec after having reversed polarity. Thus, lamp conduction is effected in about 50 of the time when a non linear dielectric element is employed as compared to apparatus which does not include the non linear dielectric element. Also, the illustration of FIG. 4 compares the lamp voltage of apparatus which includes a non linear dielectric element Curve E with apparatus which does not include a non linear dielectric element Curve F . As can readily be seen, the lamp voltage whereat the lamp is extinguished is greater for the apparatus employing a non linear dielectric element Curve E than the apparatus wherein the non linear dielectric element is not employed Curve F . Moreover, the improved apparatus has a lamp extinguishing voltage which is about 8.0 volts greater than the apparatus which does not have a non linear dielectric element. Specifically, the above mentioned test results were provided by apparatus operable from a source voltage in the range of about 108 to 132 volts AC and employed a 70 watt high pressure sodium lamp having a fill gas of Xenon at a pressure of about 30 Torr. The inductive ballast had an inductance of about 235 millihenries and an impedance of about 88.7 ohms at a voltage of about 94.0 volts and a current of about 1.06 amperes. Also, the non linear dielectric element was a TDK manufactured element having a diameter of about 12 mm and a thickness of about 0.5 mm. Accordingly, it was found that the improved apparatus has an extinguishing voltage about 8.0 volts higher than the extinguishing voltage of prior known structures. Also, the increased voltage and a substantially constant wattage permits a reduction in current by about 13 and a decrease of about 4.6 in the voltage applied to the inductive ballast. Thus, the volt ampere requirements of the inductive ballast were reduced by about 17 which permits a reduction in size, weight and volume of the inductive ballast. Accordingly, the addition of a non linear dielectric element reduces the lamp starting period after each polarity reversal of current which, in turn. Permits a reduction in the size of the inductive ballast required and increases the lamp voltage available prior to extinguishment of the discharge lamp. Thus, the discharge lamp starts sooner, stays on longer and is permitted to develop a greater potential before lamp extinguishment occurs.
