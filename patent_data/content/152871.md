# Process control apparatus.

## Abstract
A process control apparatus according to the present invention comprises a feed back control system 44, 46, 48 for outputting a feedback control signal which is computed by comparing and adjusting a set value SV and a process variable PV , and a feedforward control system 56, 58 for outputting a disturbance compensation signal DK by de tecting and compensating for the disturbance based on the feedforward control model 58 . The gain of the feedback control signal is corrected in response to the magnitude of the disturbance variations by the gain scheduling unit 52 , and the gain of the feedforward control model is controlled by supplying a correction signal which compares and equalizes, at the feedforward control model gain adaptive unit 60 , the disturbance compensation signal and the ma nipulated variable MV obtained by additively synthesizing the disturbance compensation signal and the feedback sig nal that is gain corrected by the gain scheduling unit. The feedforward control model 58 comprises a gain memory for memorizing the FF model gain correction signal from the feedforward control model gain adaptive unit 60 and an operational means for receiving a correction signal from the gain memory and a disturbance signal to compute and output a disturbance compensation signal. And, the process control apparatus further includes an FF model gain adap tive mechanism for controlling the supply to the gain memo ry of the FF model gain correction signal by confirming that the process is in a steady state, the process is settled, and a state continues in which the difference between the distur bance compensation signal and the manipulated quantity exceeds a prescribed value, and for controlling as well the additive synthesis of the disturbance compensation signal to the feedback control signal.
