# Improvements in windows or canopies.

## Abstract
A bubble window for a caravan comprises a first part 1 of channel shape section having lateral flanges 1c to which a flat sheet 2 is bonded thereby forming a hollow tubular structure defining a cavity 3 with open ends. The open ends are closed by means of end members 4 having slots 7 and 8 to receive the ends of the tubular member which are bonded thereto. The end members include channels 8a to receive stay means 9. The arrangement avoids the need for forming each window shape by pressing. The channel section may bet hot rolled or extruded and cut to lenght then bonded to the flat sheet and the end members connected to the structure to form the complete window.

## Description
Improvements in windows or canopies. This invention relates to windows or canopies of double s8.innei construction and produced fron plastics materials. The invention is nainly concerned with the construction of double glazed windows for caravans wherein such windows have a construction forded by an outer bubble of plastics naterial and an inner sheet bonded thereto thus forming a cavity. In known constructions of windows the outer bubble is produced by hot pressing and a Mould press is required for every different dinension of window to be produced. The inner sheet is norMally flat and adhesively bonded to the peripheral edges of the bubble. Because of non standardisation of windows costs are high in view of the fact that each window size has to be nanufactured individually to. size. It is also necessary to provide special moulded or pressed portions in the bubble to secure stays and catches required where the window is to be opening. Such fixtures have to be connected to both the bubble and inner sheet which nornally are brought into juxtaposition at the point of securenent. It is an object of this invention to provided a window which is sinpler to produce in a wide ranse of sizes fron basic conponent parts and which is readily connected to stays and the like fittings without special fastening techniques being required. A further object of this invention is to provide a window of better appearance. According to this invention there is provided a window comprising an elongate channel shape portion and a sheet ember integral therewith to define an elongate tubular member forming a cavity, the open ends of the cavity being closed off by end members bonded to the edges of the channel and sheet. The tubular member May conprise a hollow preformed extrusion or casting which has been pressed to a flat shape to forn the window. Alternatively the nenber nay be extruded or cast to the tubular shape required for the window. According to this invention there is also provided a window comprising an elongate channel shape portion and a sheet member bonded thereto along the side edges so as to close the open face of the channel to forn a cavity, the open ends of the cavity being closed off by end nenbers bonded to the edges of the channel and sheet. In this latter enbodinent the boning nay be effected by Means of gluing, ultrasonic boning or laser welding. with such a construction the bubble is forned by the channel portion and this nay be produced in any length by moulding or hot pressing or rolling. This portion nay then be cut to an appropriate length for a window and the sheet bonded thereto. The end members preferably conprise noulded parts and these nay be formed fron an internediate extrusion of required profile finished by moulded end blocks this then enabling the ends to be sinply adapted to any width of channel. For a window to be nade up only a standard range of channel widths is required the length being cut as necessary. The channel will preferably include a flange portion extending laterally fron each side forning a lip to which the sheet nay be bonded and the lip May have a rebate to accomodate the thickness of the sheet. In a preferred enbodinent the end members include channels adapted to received an end of a stay, the channels forming tracks. The end MeMberspreferably have slots to receive the edges of the channel and sheet. A third channel of lesser depth nay be provided to forn a triple glazed window positioned between the channel and sheet or another moulded channel can be bonded to the rear of the sheet with the cavities formed again being closed by the end members. The end members May have vent neans therein which afford air access to the cavity formed or to one or the cavities forned in the case of a triple or More glazed unit. The end Menbers can be provided with vents formed as an integral part of the construction. An embodiment according to the invention is shown by way of exanple in the accoMpanying drawings and wherein Figure 1, shows a plan view of part of a window, Figure 2, shows a section on B B of Figure 1, Figure 3, shows a section on C C of Figure 1, Figure 4, is a detail of an end member, and Figure j, is a section on A A of Figure 4. Referring to the drawings these show a double glazed bubble type window for a caravan, as an example only, and coMprising an outer window portion I of channel shape and formed fron an acrylic plasticsMaterial by hot rolling fron a sheet. Other nethods of manufacture are possible and this portion can be of any length. The portion 1 has a flat outer surface la, sides ib and lateral flanges 1c to which a flat inner window sheet 2 is bonded thereby defining a cavity 3 having open ends. The ends are closed off by members which May comprise a single Moulded part 4 as shown in Figure 1 or a moulded extrusion 5 as shown in Figure 4 with end blocks 6. In either case the end member has slots 7 and 8 which receive, respectivelyf the edges of the channel 1 and sheet 2 which are then bonded thereto. The advantage of the arrangeMent of Figure 4 is that the member part 5 can be extruded and cut to length with the end blocks bonded after asseMbly of the window. The members 4 or 5 also nay include a channel 8a which receives the end of a stay fitting which May slide in a track 9 as shown inFigure 2. The flanges 1c nay be rebate at 10 as shown in Figure 3 to accomodate the sheet 2 As nay be seen a window can be nade up to requirements by cutting a suitable channel section 1 to length, cutting the sheet 2 to size and bonding same to the sides of the channel and thereafter fitting the appropriate end members 4 which are moulded according to the channel size or else cutting the moulding 5 and then fitting the end blocks 6. The end members for a strong point for attachment of stays and May also be suitably apertured to form ventilation Means. As an alternative to the above decried embodiment the elongate structure forming the window nay be extruded as a hollow body in one piece rather than being joined. In another arrangement the structureMay be pressed froe an extrusion of standard shape such as a cylinder. This invention also provides the Method of nanufacturins c window generally as hereinbefore described. A particular advantage in this arrangement is that the end members 4 or 5 form good supports for the window stay which can be accomodated in the channels therein.
