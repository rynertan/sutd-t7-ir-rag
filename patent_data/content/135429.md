Description The Synthesis of Cyclopropane Amino Acids and Peptides The present application is a Continuation In PartApplication of pending Application Serial No. 523,808 filed August 16, 1983. The United States Government has a non exclusive license right in the present invention for government purposes pursuant to N.I.H.Grant No. DA 02938 awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services.Technical Field The field of the invention is a new class of amino acid derivatives which in large measure have never been described in the literature and which were first synthesized into a peptide which exhibited unexpected stability against hydrolytic cleavage and degradation by organic acids and enzymes. A specific field of use for the new product is in a beverage composition which includes a novel peptide sweetener which is stable to acid hydrolysis by such organic acids as citric and fumaric acids and enzyme degradation and cleavage to give prolonged sweetness to the product. Food compositions are also described which employ the new peptides as ingredients.Background Art The only process described in the literature and related to the novel process disclosed herein is the addition of compound 1 wherein R1 R2 hydrogen to compound 2 to form a cyclopropylanine acid 4 to wit EMI2.1 wherein the RÚ, Rê, R and R4 are as defined below, as reported by Bregovec and T. Jakoveic, Monats furChemie, 1972 103, 288. The commonly known addition ofCH2N2 to unsaturated azlactones M. Bernabe, et al, Ann de Qufmica 1972, 68, 501, 1055 Eur. J. Med.

I. et al Tetrahedron, 1964, 20, 891 is similar but not the same process and product of the present invention. The present synthesis requires the addition of a substituted diazomethane specifically to a dehydroalanine derivative which must be synthesized for this purpose to form a 5 substituted pyrazoline.Contrary to this the initial product formed in the process described in the prior art literature is a 4substituted pyrazoline which is then converted into the cyclopropyl amino acid. Other reported synthesis of cyclopropyl amino acid analogs of the present invention are reported by V.Schollkopf, R. Harms and D. Hoppe, Liebigs Ann. Chem.611, 1973 also Martinez Garcia, F.H. Cano and S.Garcia Blanco, Acta Crystallographia, 31 1980 , Sect.A. Suppl. 5103, also A. Ichihara, K. Shiraishi and S.Sakamura, Tetrahedron Letters 269, 1977 for synthesis of coronamic acid. As to prior synthesis attempts at peptides containing cyclopropyl amino acids see F.H.C. Stewart,Austrian Jour. of Chemistry, 34 pp 2431 1981 . As to foreign patents Spanish Patent No. 448,771 issued July 16, 1977 discloses a cyclopropyl phenylalanine and cyclopropyl tyrosine. A cyclopropylphenylalanine has been described in the literature by King et al Synthesis of Racemic E and Z l Amino 2 phenylcyclopropanecarboxylic Acid E and Z Cyclopropylphenylalanine Jour. of OrganicChem. 1982, 47, 3270 3273. In addition United StatesPatent 3,313,842 to Kaiser et al issued in 1967 discloses phenylcyclopropanecarboxylic acids and esters as hypotensive agents, U.S. Patent 3,050,559 to Burger discloses cyclopropyl amines. Also U.S. Patent 4,298,760 describes an improved process for preparation of l aminocyclopropane l carboxylic acid for use as a plant growth regulator. Kimura et al in Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 115, p.112 115 No. 1 1983 describes the synthesis of cyclopropyl phenylalanine and its use in preparation of a stabilized peptide. As can be observed from the above prior art background several of the cyclopropyl amino acids are known materials and a peptide which employs one of these known amino acid analogues is reported in the prior art.Disclosure of the Invention The process aspects of the present invention describe a method which generates chiral cycloalkyl amino acids directly. This means that if chirality is present in a dehydroalanine derivative optically active cycloalkyl amino acids can be prepared directly without the necessity of resolution. This is not possible in other reported prior art processes. In the product aspects of the invention new stereo specific cycloalkyl amino acids are disclosed. Another process aspect of the invention comprises a process for synthesizing an acid or enzyme stable peptide containing at least one stereo specific cycloalkyl amino acid residue. These totally unique peptides for the most part retain their initial biological activity but because of steric blocking or hinderance effected by the inclusion of the new claimed amino acid analogs as a substitute for one or more normal amino acid residues in the peptide chain the peptide becomes cleavage resistant. As a result of their altered amino acid structure the peptide products of the invention do not degrade upon contact with hydrolytic enzymes or organic acids. Their enhanced stability is manifest by their new resistance to cleavage of the peptide linkages and methyl ester bonds. This stability has pharmacological advantages. There are at least three product aspects to the invention. The first is the new and unique cycloalkyl substituted amino acids described. These variant amino acids when substituted for normal amino acids in a peptide chain act to stabilize the peptide against cleavage by enzymes and hydrolysis by acids. The peptides so formed are themselves unique products having a distinctly different molecular structure and an added property of long term stability. A third product aspect of the invention resides in the preparation of a food product, for example, a beverage with long term sweetness when its peptide sweetener is replaced by the cycloalkyl amino acid modified peptide sweetener of the present invention. Specific examples of each of these process and products aspects of the present invention will be set forth hereinbelow. It is of course clear that because of the magnitude of peptides known for a multitude of purposes in many end use areas of food chemistry, pharmacology, herbicide and pesticide end use applications, etc. the concrete embodiments to support all of the possible broad implications of the present invention are difficult to express in a single document. However, the basic concept and application of the same to a new food composition has been set forth herein to exemplify the broad notion of the invention. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide new stereo specific cyclopropyl amino acids. It is a further object to provide new peptides containing at least one stereo specific cyclopropyl amino acid residue. It is a further object to provide an end product containing the peptide as an ingredient. These and other objects, aspects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from a consideration of the accompanying specification and claims Brief Description of the Drawings No drawing is submitted in this case since the subject matter does not warrant such disclosure.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention The process embodiment of the present invention is carried out by allowing a diazo compound 1 , in the presence or absence of a catalyst or light, to react with a dehydroalanine derivative 2 .

The reaction temperature first step is 0 300C and that of the second step may be 00 1500C. A solvent such as benzene or toluene or the like may be used in the second step. For purposes of obtaining the free cyclopropyl amino acid AA , compound 4 may be C terminal deblocked, depending on the nature of R3, by standard procedures such as saponification or hydrogenolysis giving the acid 5 as shown in equation C, below EMI7.1 Equation C and N terminal deblocking of 5 by the use of anhydrous acid, dry HC1 or CF3CO2H1 by hydrogenolysis or by hydrolysis, depending on the nature of R3, can be accomplished by standard procedures as shown in equation D, below EMI8.1 Equation D Deblocking of the amino group N terminal deblocking as shown in equation E, below, may precede deblocking of the carboxyl group C terminal deblocking equationC resulting in a cyclopropyl amino acid.A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT METHOD OF PREPARINGCYCLOPROPYL AMINO ACID One facet of this process invention thus discloses a process for synthesizing a cyclopropyl amino acid selected from the group consisting of 2S E , 2R E , 2S Z 2R Z , 2S , 2R , 2RS E , and 2RS Zisomers wherein the cyclopropyl amino acid i8 selected from the group consisting of cyclopropyl amino acids, analogs, derivatives, and cogeners thereof comprising the following steps a reacting a diazo compound having the formula R1R2CN2 wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aromatic group, an alkyl group substituted by a halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, an alkyl group substituted by an aromatic group, and an aromatic group substituted by a halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur aromatic or aliphatic group, wherein R2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aromatic group, an alkyl group substituted by a halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, an alkyl group substituted by an aromatic group and an aromatic group substituted by a halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur aromatic or aliphatic group, with a dehydroalanine derivative having the formula 3 EMI9.1 wherein R3is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group, an aromatic group, an alkoxy group, and an aryloxy group and wherein R4 is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group and an aryl group to produce an initial reaction product b decomposing the initial reaction product 3 to produce a cyclopropyl amino acid derivative having the formulaEMI9.2 wherein the cyclopropyl amino acid derivative is a mixture of stereoisomers c separating the mixture of stereoisomers by physical means into E and Z diastereomers wherein the E and Z diastereomers comprise a pair of enantiomers d separating the pair of enantiomers by standard resolution means to produce a stereo specific cyclopropyl amino acid derivative e deblocking the initial reaction product to produce a stereo specific cyclopropyl amino acid having the formulaEMI10.1 If R1 or R2 contain acidic groups selected from the group consisting of carboxyl, mercapto, and phenolic hydroxyl, R1 and R2 are blocked by standard means to protect such groups during the process.

The cyclopropane ring of the variant amino acid sterically hinders reactions at the adjacent carbonyl and amino functions and the groups CO2H and phenyl will retard the enzyme splitting or cleavage of the peptide linkages. Short chain dipeptides where both amino acids have been cyclopropylized will be particularly stable to acid hydrolysis at the methylester group and the peptide linkage both, Unless the peptides themselves are toxic to humans no added toxicity due to the modified unnatural amino acid components should be exhibited by the sweetener. The following example illustrates a specific end product embodiment within the scope of this invention and is not to be construed as limiting said scope.Where the invention has been described herein with regard to a certain specific embodiment, it is not so limited. It is to be understood that variations and modifications thereof may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. It must be remembered that the sweetening properties of the aspartame type of peptide is dependent upon the stereochemistry of the individual amino acid components of the peptide. Each of the amino acids can exist in either dextro D or leavo L rotatory form. The L form of the compounds possess the sweetness characteristic as best can be determined at this point. The D form of isomers are usually bitter or tastless. Combinations of the D and L forms of isomers are sometimes sweet also but usually not as intense in their sweetness as the L isomers. The new dipeptide cyclopropyl derivatives of the following example are water soluble substances which can be used in a number of applications where a non toxic non sugar type sweetener is desired. They are 100 200 times as sweet as sucrose and exhibit long term retention of that sweetening capacity. Moreover, the new dipeptides do not exhibit the unpleasant aftertaste characteristic of saccharine and cyclamates. These dipeptide compositions are particularly valuable as sweetening agents for carbonated and noncarbonated beverages, chewing gum edible materials such as fruit juices, vegetables, fruit, dairy products such as egg product, milk drinks, ice cream, syrups, cake mixes, instant beverage mixes, soda pop formulae, iceing and dessert toppings, sherbert, meat products, wines and salad mixes, and dressings.

Example XXXVII I Synthesis of Cyclopropyl Aspartyl Phenylalanine MethylEster a. N Boc Dehydro Aspartic Acid Ft Butyl Methyl Ester A solution of 5 g of N Boc ss hydroxyaspartic acid ester in 25 mL of acetic anhydride should be heated to a temperature of app. 100 for 1 hr. and is evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The crude dehydro aspartic acid derivative should be precipitated from an appropriate solvent such as ethyl acetate using petroleum ether and used directly in the next step. The yield is quantitative. This is first intermediate.b. N Boc Cyclopropyl Aspartic Acid Ft Butyl Methyl Ester The crude dehydro aspartic acid derivative should be dissolved in 50 mL of methylene chloride and gaseous diazomethane passed into the solution until excess reagent is present in the solution. After standing overnight, the solution is evaporated and the residue is dissolved in 10 mL of dry benzene and refluxed until no further N2 is evolved. Evaporation of the solution gives the crude product which is purified by crystallization from an appropriate solvent or chromatographed on a silica column. If E and Z isomers are present these are to be separated by careful chromatography. The yield is 60 70 . This is the second intermediate.c. N Boc Cyclopropyl Aspartic Acid B t Butyl Ester To a solution of 5 g of N Boc cyclopropyl aspartic acid Ft butyl a methyl ester in 50 mL of methanol should be added a 1.1 molar excess of 4N NaOH and the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for four hours. The solution should then be evaporated to a very small volume in vacuo, diluted with 50 mL of water, and ten percent citric acid solution added until the pH is 5 6. The product precipitates and is collected on a filter. After washing with water, the product is dried in a desiccator and is crystallized from ethyl acetate. Yield quantitative.d. N Boc Ft Butyl Cyclopropyl Aspartyl Phenylalanine Methyl Ester To a solution of 5 g of N Boc 8 t butyl cyclopropyl aspartic acid in 50 mL of methylene chloride should be added 1 molar equivalent each of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, N hydroxybenztriazole, and phenylalanine methyl ester. After 16 hr. at room temperature, the mixture should be filtered and the filtrate washed successively with 10 NaHC03, 10 HC1 and brine and dried over anhyd. Na2S04. After evaporation to dryness, the residue should be crystallized from an appropriate solvent such as ethyl acetate. Yield is 70 .Cyclopropyl Aspartyl Phenylalanine Methyl Ester To a 1 1 solution of trifluoroacetic acid and methylene chloride 50 mL should be added 5 g ofN Boc ss t butyl cyclopropyl aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester and the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature f or one hour and evaporated to dryness. The crude peptide should be dissolved in 10 acetic acid and the solution should be passed through a column of Biogel P 2 and the ninhydrin reactive fractions pooled and lyophilized. Crystallization of the pure peptide from aqueous alcohol or some appropriate solvent mixture gives pure cyclopropyl aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester, yield quantitative. This is the final product. This peptide is very sweet to the taste and can be used to sweeten soft drinks, foods of all kinds, etc. As noted above the new sweetner compounds have about 100 times to 200 times the sweetness power of ordinary sucrose. To sweeten an 8 ounce cup of coffee a 1 gram quantity of the new product can be employed for example depending on the taste of the user. One packet of 0.035 oz. or 1 gram of the products ofExamples XXXV or XXXVI II is equivalent in sweetness power to 2 teaspoonfuls of sucrose. A significant advantage of the present product ofExamples XXXV and XXXVII I is that they do not hydrolyze in the intestine of the consumer when contacted by intestinal enzymes such as carboxypeptidase and chymotrypsin to generate methanol which leads to formation of formaldehyde. This means that a user can drink a cup of coffee, soda or other beverage sweetened with the cyclopropylized dipeptide VAsp Phe OCH3 or ASP VPHE.OCH 3 and while the sweetner performs its designated function it does not hydrolyze cleave or break down in the gastrointestinal tract or blood for at least 24 hours. This is sufficient time for the product in vivo to pass out of the body either with the feces or the urine. The significance of this lack of hydrolysis is that it has been alleged that metabolic fragments, i.e., hydrolysis products of normal L Asp Phe.OCH3 do cause in some consumers side effects such as behavior modification, hyperactivity genetic changes, and brain tumors. The following comparative in vitro study of commercial ASPARTAME and the new food sweeteners ofExample XXXV is presented to demonstrate the unexpected and beneficial utility in synthetic sweetners exhibited by the product of the invention. COMPARATIVE PEPTIDE TESTS FOR STABILITY Aspartame and new stabilized Asp VZ Phe OMe 29 of Example XXXV were comparison tested for stability to enzymatic hydrolysis by a chymotrypsin. The product from hydrolysis of Aspartame would be Asp Phe OH 2 , z and from 29 Asp VZ Phe OH. A ratio of 10 1 substrate enzyme was used in a 0.5 M ammonium acetate solution which was adjusted to pH 8 with 10 ammonium hydroxide. After 15 minutes at room temperature aspartame was hydrolyzed to give the acid 2 and methanol. After 24 hours at room temperature, 29 failed to hydrolyze. Thus, response to hydrolysis by a chymotrypsin of compound 29 is completely different than the response of aspartame. The new food product of Example XXXV is hence demonstrated to have a sharp and distinct new property of resistance to peptide degradation by hydrolysis. Example XXXIX A powdered sweetener mix for use as the equivalent of sucrose can be prepared by mixing Ingredient GramsCyclopropyl Dipeptide of Example XXXV or 0.216Example XXXVIIIDextrose solids 50 1.70Corn syrup solids 50 Tribasic Calcium Phosphate 0.01Cellulose gum as a 0.11Microcrystalline cellulose This dry powderous material is free flowing and soluble instantly in aqueous hot or cold liquids. A single dose of 1 gram of this product will sweeten 300 c.c. of a carbonated or non carbonated aqueous beverage. It is stable against all types of hydrolyzing agents, including food acids. The new peptide sweetener prepared by the methods of the preceding examples can be advantageously employed in a new and unique beverage composition.This new food composition has the added merit over ordinary aspartame sweetened beverages in that despite the presence of an organic acid in the formulation the composition has long term stability of its sweetener ingredients. The following is an illustration of such a practical use although it is clear that a number Of other food applications are feasible. Example XL A fruit flavored beverage mix can be prepared employing the following formulation which includes the new peptide sweetener Ingredient Parts by WeightPeptide Sweetener ofExample XXXV 0.89 citric Acid 5.53Clouding agent as shown inU.S. Patent 3,023,106 2.28Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 0.90Tricalcium phosphate 0.49TRisodium citrate 0.70Vitamin C 0.47Tenfold orange oil 0.26Vitamin A 0.04Color mixing 50 50 FDC No. 5 and FDC No. 6 yellow 0.01 6.5 grams of the above beverage mix can be reconstituted in a pint of water to produce a beverage exhibiting a highly acceptable mouth feel, cloud stability and natural fruit juice appearance. Example XLI A beverage can be manufactured and placed in 12 ounce cans which has a high margin of freedom from peptide sweetner decomposition and attendant problems of generation of methanol. The composition comprises Ingredient GramsCarbonated water, 299Caramel color, 0.1Phosphoric Acid, 0.2Artificial flavor, 0.12Preservative Sodium Benzoate, 0.2 Ingredient GramsCitric acid, 0.15Caffeine, and 0.1Peptide of Example XXXV 2.16 This makes 300 c.c. of carbonated soda.
