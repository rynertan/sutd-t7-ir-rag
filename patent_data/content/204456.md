## Description
The present invention relates to a hydrolyzable resin composition. More specifically, the invention concerns a hydrolyzable resin composition based on the resin having at least one side chain bearing a particular metal containing terminal group. The invention also concerns an antifouling coating composition containing said hydrolyzable resin composition as a resinous vehicle. Today, it is a very common to apply onto ship s bottom an antifouling coating composition comprising an organic or inorganic antifouling agent and a resinous binder as vinyl resin, alkyd resin. In that case, since the antifouling effect is fully dependent on the antifouling agent dissolved out of the coating and the dissolution of said agent is primarily a diffusion phenomenon caused by a concentration gradient of said agent in the coating, it is unable to expect a long lasting, stable antifouling effect with them. Further more, since the water insoluble resinous component will, after dissolution of said agent from the coating, form a skeleton structure, there are additional problems as increase in resistance of friction between the ship surface and water, lowering of sailing speed, increase in sailing fuel. Under the circumstances, an antifouling coating composition comprising an antifouling agent and a hydrolyzable resin vehicle capable of forming a comparatively tough coating and being gradually decomposed by hydrolysis in sea water has become the center of public attention. The present inventors had already found that a class of polyester resins having a number of metal ester bondings in their polyester backbone chains are useful as a resinous vehicle in a polishing type antifouling paint, and applied for patent as Japanese Patent Application Nos. 165922 81 and 196900 83. Such resins are of the nature of being easily hydrolyzed, under weak alkaline condition as in sea water, at the metal ester bonding portions, disintegrated to a number of small, low molecular weight segments and dissolved in sea water. However, said resins are primarily of comparatively low molecular weight e.g. upto about 2000 and are poor in film forming property, and therefore, said coating compositions still have the problems of easy occurence of cracks and peeling of the formed coatings. If the molecular weight of said polyester resin is increased to a moderate level, it is indeed possible to improve the film forming property, but, at that time, it will necessarily be attended with a marked decrease in hydrolysis property of the resin. To compensate the same, if the metal ester bonding in the backbone chain of the resin is increased in number, there will give additional problems that the resulted resin is only soluble in a polar solvent and not in most solvents commonly used in a coating composition, and that the formed coating is swollen with sea water. These attemps would therefore, give no fruitful results, and thus, there leaves much to be desired. An attempt has also been made to use a resin whose side chain has a trialkyl tin ester portion as a terminal group. In this type of resin, polarity of the resin is gradually increased in proportion to the progress in hydrolysis of said ester portion, and the resin is finally dissolved in sea water. Typical examples of such resins are acrylic resins having as a constitutional element tri organo tin salts of α,β unsaturated basic acids. In this case, in order to obtain a stabilized, tough coating, the resin should preferably be free from hydrophilic goups if circumstances allow, and in order to ensure the dissolution of the hydrolyzed resin in sea water, the resin should preferably have as many hydrophilic goups as possible, i.e. more than a certain critical range, after said hydrolysis. Therefore, in the preparation of such resin by the copolymerization of tri organo tin salt of α,β unsaturated basic acid and other acrylic vinyl monomers, attempts have been made such that the former is presented in a higher concentration in the reaction system and the latter is selected from the members with no or least amount of hydrophilic groups. Thus, a copolymer of acrylate, acrylamide, styrene containing 55 to 70 wt of tri organo tin salt of α,β unsaturated monobasic acid has been prepared and practically used. In this type of resin, differing from the aforesaid polyester resin having metal ester bondings in its main chain, hydrophilic carboxyl goups are generated at the time when the tri organo tin portions at the side chains are released through hydrolysis and the resin is only dissolved in sea water at the stage where the concentration of said carboxyl groups get to a certain critical point. The film forming property of the resin is also excellent. However, there includes a problem that a considerable quantity of highly expense and toxic organo tin compound are essential. Therefore, from both hygienic and economic point of view, it has been longed for cuting the amount of obviating the use of such material. Attention is also drawn to FR A 2307857, which teaches the use of polyacrylic acid derivatives as anti fouling coatings in the nautical field. A principal object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a novel type of hydrolyzable resin composition which has an excellent film forming property and whose resin is characterized by having at the side chain portions a particular group capable of resulting a hydrophilic group through hydrolysis, being hydrolyzed and dissolved in sea water at an appropriate rate, and being prepared without the necessity of using a tri organo tin compound which is expensive and toxic material. An additional object is to provide an antifouling coating composition based on said novel resin composition. According to the present invention, the aforesaid objects are attained by providing a hydrolyzable resin composition consisting essentially of a resin having at least one side chain bearing at least one terminal group of the formula The novel hydrolyzable resin composition of this invention is characterized by comprising a resin which has at least one side chain bearing at least one terminal group of the aforesaid formula. Such resin may be easily and advantageously prepared by either one of the following methods More specifically, the present resin composition may be prepared by either one of the following methods. In the aforesaid methods, as the polymerizable unsaturated organic acid c , the following may be advantageously used each separately or in combination of two and more of them methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, p styrene sulfonic acid, 2 methyl 2 acrylamide propane sulfonic acid, methacryl acid phosphoxy propyl, methacryl 3 chloro 2 acid phosphoxy propyl, methacryl acid phosphoxy ethyl, itaconic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, monoalkyl itaconate e.g. methyl, ethyl, butyl, 2 ethyl hexyl, monalkyl maleate e.g. methyl, ethyl, butyl, 2 ethyl hexyl half ester of acid anhydride with hydroxyl containing polymerizable unsaturated monomer e.g. half ester of succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride or phthalic anhydride with 2 hydroxy ethyl meth acrylate. As the monovalent organic acid b , any of aliphatic, aromatic, alicyclic or heterocyclic organic acids may be advantageously used. Typical Examples of such acids are as follows In the present invention, as the organic acid capable of being hydrolyzed to release the antifouling metallic ions from their bound form, any of the abovementioned acids may be satisfactorily used. However, if desired, the organic acid per se may also be participated in the antifouling effect and at that time, selection is made of a monovalent organic acid having an antifouling property. Such acid may be easily found out from various organic acids customarily used as agricultural agents, medicins, repellents, fungicides, bactericides, preservatives, by conducting a simple test wherein a sample amount of acid is placed in a cavity of test plate, the test plate is covered with a wire net and dipped in sea water for a defined period of time and thereafter, adhesion of marine livings on the wire net is examined. It would be quite easy for those skilled in the art to find out an appropriate acid by the aforesaid test. More specifically, the followings are advantageously used for this end. By the selection of such acid, an organic acid residue of the formula may be freely and successfully incorporated, in the form of metal ester, into a side chain of a resin, as a terminal group. As already stated, said R₁ may be any kind of monovalent organic residues, and however, the inventors have also found that when said R₁ is a group of the formula R₅ R₆ or R₆ in which R₂ is hydrogen or a hydrocarbon residue having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and R₃ and R₄ each represents a hydrocarbon residue having 1 to 12 carbon atoms R₅ is a hydrocarbon residue having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R₆ is a cyclic hydrocarbon having 5 to 12 carbon atoms, there is a surprising effect such that it will cause a decrease in glass transition temperature of the produced resin, which in turn produces a plasticizing effect of the resin. In consequence, there results an increase in film strength and a marked improvement in crack resistance of the formed film. It is also of advantage to the film forming property of the resin. Therefore, such acids are highly recommended as a monovalent organic acid. Na metals e.g. Sn, Pb, Si , VIa metals e.g. Se , VIb metals e.g. Cr, Mo , VIIb metals e.g. Mn , and VIII metals e.g. Fe, Co, Ni may be used together with said particular metal s . However, the present invention is characterized by using at least one of zinc, copper and tellurium as metal component, which are lower in an ionization tendency than an alkali metal. These metals are generally used in the form of oxide, hydroxide or chloride, but may be used in other forms, as halogenide other than chloride, nitrate, sulfate, carbonate if desired. In an ester exchange reaction, if desired, the following tin compounds may be also used together with the aforesaid metal salts of organic acids As the aforesaid other polymerizable unsaturated monomers, any of the known monomers customarily used in the preparation of acrylic or vinyl resins may be successfully used. Examples of such monomers are methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl acrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, octyl acrylate, octyl methacrylate, 2 ethyl hexyl acrylate, 2 ethyl hexyl methacrylate, styrene, vinyl toluene, vinyl pyridine, vinyl pyrolidone, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, methacrylo nitrile, dimethyl itaconate, dibutyl itaconate, di 2 ethyl hexyl itaconate, dimethyl maleate, di 2 ethyl hexyl maleate, ethylene, propyrene, vinyl chloride. If desired, hydroxy containing monomers as, for example, 2 hydroxy ethyl acrylate, 2 hydroxy ethyl methacrylate, 2 hydroxy propyl acrylate, 2 hydroxy propyl methacrylate may also be used. As the resins d and g which have an organic acid group at a side chain, mention is made of organic acid bearing vinyl resins, polyester resins, oil modified alkyd resins, fatty acid modified alkyd resins, epoxy resins. In the present resin having at a side chain the aforesaid terminal group of monovalent organic acid metal ester bonding every organic acids in the side chains need not necessarily having such a particular metal ester bonding and some of them may be left unreacted in the form of free acid, if desired. Regarding the molecular weight of the present resin obtained by either one of the abovesaid methods, there is no particular limitation on it, and however, as a resinous vehicle of an antifouling paint, it is preferably determined in a range of, in terms of number average molecular weight, 4000 to 40000, and more preferably 6000 to 35000. This is because at a level of less than 4000, the film forming property of the resin is insufficient and therefore, there is a fear that cracks and peeling of the formed coating are liable to occur, while at a level of more than 40000 storage stability of the coating composition is very poor and more over, there is a necessity of using a large amount of dilution solvent, which may cause additional problems in both economy and public health. The resin composition of this invention has a characteristic feature such that when applied on a substrate as submarine structure, thus formed coating is gradually hydrolyzed and dissolved out under alkaline atmosphere. Therefore, by making the most of the abovesaid property, numerous aplications including fish net coating, capsulated agricultural chemicals may be expected for the present resin composition. However, one of the most important applications is an antifouling paint containing the same. As already stated, the present resin, differing from the heretofore known polyester having a number of metal ester bondings in its backbone chain, possesses an amount of metal ester bondings at the end portions of side chains. And, when hydrolyzed under alkaline atmosphere, the known polyester is decomposed into small segments and dissolved out at once, whereas in the present resin, hydrophilic groups are gradually formed at the side chain portions and the resin is dissolved out at the first time when the concentration of said hydrophilic groups comes to a certain critical point. Therefore, when used as a resinous vehicle in an antifouling coating composition, the antifouling action can be controlled for a longer period of time. For an optimum dissolution of the resin in sea water, the metal content is preferably determined in a range of 0.3 to 20 , more preferably 0.5 to 15 , by weight of the resin. This is because, at a level of less than 0.3 by weight, the dissolution rate of the resin is too slow, whereas at a level of more than 20 by weight, it is too high, and both of the cases are undesired for the intended object. There is no need of the acid value and hydroxyl number of the present metal containing resin being zero, and certain degree of acid value and hydroxyl number may be permissible providing giving the nature of being insoluble in sea water. More specifically, permissible acid value of said resin is up to 40 KOH mg g, and more preferably up to 30 KOH mg g, and acceptable hydroxyl number is up to 200 KOH mg g, more preferably up to 150 KOH mg g. The present resin composition may be applied as it is as a clear coating. However, any of the conventional additives as pigment, solvent, may be added to formulate an antifouling coating composition. Since the present resin composition comprises a resin capable of being hydrolyzed to generate an antifouling metal ion and in a preferred embodiment, an organic acid having an antifouling property, too, it is not always essential to add an additional antifouling agent to formulate an antifouling coating composition. However, if desired, any of the known organic or inorganic antifouling agent or other toxic material may be added thereto. Examples of such materials are bis tributyl tin oxide, tributyl tin chloride, tributyl tin fluoride, tributyl tin acetate, tributyl tin nicotinate, tributyl tin versatate, bis tributyl tin α,α dibromosuccinate, triphenyl tin hydroxide, triphenyl tin nicotinate, triphenyl tin versate, bis triphenyl tin α,α dibromosuccinate, bis triphenyl tin oxide and other organo tin compounds. In formulating the present coating composition, any of the techniques customarily used in the related fields may be satisfactorily used. For example, the selected raw materials are combined and mixed well by means of ball mill, pebble mill, roll mill, speed run mill. The present antifouling coating composition is characterized by providing a coating capable of exhibiting a stabilized antifouling effect for a longer duration of time, which is as effective as known antifouling coating composition based on triorgano tin containing acrylic resin. Furthermore, since the present coating composition can be made without the necessity of being fully relied on an expensive and toxic triorgano tin compound, the manufacturing cost can be markedly lowered and hygienic problem can be effectively obviated. The invention shall be now more fully explained in the following Examples. Unless otherwise being stated, all parts and percentage are by weight.

To this, a mixture of 50 parts of methyl methacrylate, 40 parts of ethyl acrylate and 1.5 parts of azobisisobutyronitrile was dropwise added at a constant speed in 3 hours and thereafter, the combined mixture was maintained at the same temperature for 2 hours. 10 parts of copper naphthenate were then added and the mixture was stirred at 70 C for 2 hours to obtain Comparative varnish B having a solid content of 50.2 and a viscosity of 0.52 Pa.s 5.2 poise .

This varnish was reprecipitated from methanol and thus obtained resin was analyzed in the same way as in Example 1. The copper content of the resin was 6.9wt .

The respective composition was applied onto a test plate in about 200µm dry thickness and thus prepared plate was attached to Discrotor, immersed in sea water and rotated at a constant speed for 3 months as in Examples 14 to 28. The test results are shown in Table 6.

Repeating the same procedures as stated in Example 1 but using the following synthetic fatty acids in place of naphthenic acid, various varnishes V 23 to V 27 were obtained. Using the varnishes of Examples 39 to 47 and the materials shown in Table 8 and subjecting to a dispersion operation in ball mill for 5 hours, various coating compositions were prepared. The test results shown that the antifouling coating compositions of this invention can give a long lasting, excellent polishing antifouling effect in each case. The inventors have also found that the present antifouling coating compositions are no less better than the heretofore proposed composition with trialkyl tin rich resin, in giving a stabilized, antifouling polishing effect.
