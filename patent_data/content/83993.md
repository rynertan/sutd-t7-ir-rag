# Compositions for use in increasing brain tyrosine levels.

## Abstract
A composition, which when administered, effects an increase of brain tyrosine levels as compared to the adminis tration of tyrosine alone comprises tyrosine and an insulin releasing carbohydrate. The insulin released selectively reduces plasma levels of amino acids, but with the level of tyrosine being reduced to a lesser extent so that there is reduced competition for uptake of tyrosine into the brain.
