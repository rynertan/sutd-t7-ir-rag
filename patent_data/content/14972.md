# Method and apparatus for removing moisture from wet pulp.

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus is provided to con trol the moisture content of pulp which is discharged from a press. During operation of the press 14 slurry containing the pulp enters the press 14 and engages a screw 28 which is rotated to feed the pulp upwardly in the press 14 . As the wet pulp moves upwardly, water is removed from the pulp. In order to further reduce the moisture content of the pulp, a restrictor member or cone 60 in the press outlet 42 is effective to compress the pulp against helical flighting 38 of the screw 28 . In order to maintain the moisture content of the discharged pulp substantially constant with variations in wet pulp consistency and to prevent overloading of the press drive motor 32 the restrictor cone 60 is movable axially along the screw drive shaft 34 to vary the extent to which it restricts the press outlet 42 . The restrictor cone 60 is moved along the screw drive shaft 34 under the influence of forces applied against the outer surface 64 of the cone 60 by the wet pulp. This movement of the cone 60 adjusts the extent to which the outlet 42 from the press is restricted and the extent to which the wet pulp is compressed with variations in the consistency of the wet pulp.
