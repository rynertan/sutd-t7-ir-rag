# Substituted benzophenoxazines, method for preparing same and use thereof in electrochromic recording systems.

## Abstract
5 N RCO N R¹ amino or RCOO 9 N R² N R³ ami no 12 RCO benzo a phenoxazines useful as color formers, particularly in electrochromic recording systems, are prepared by the interaction of the corresponding 5 N R¹ amino 9 N R² N R³ amino benzo a phenoxazinium halide or 9 N R² N R³ amino benzo a phenoxazin 5 one with a reducing agent to obtain the corresponding leuco compound and subsequently interacting the leuco compound with at least two molecular proportions of an acylating agent.
