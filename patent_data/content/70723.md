# Method for developing control values for controlling the performance of internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
This specification discloses a method for generating a table of engine calibration control values for an adaptive spark and EGR control strategey. The adaptive strategy adjusts spark timing and magnitude of EGR as a function of engine energy usage per distance traveled while maintaining feedgas emissions at a constant level over a wide variety of driving patterns including urban, suburban and highway. This adaptive strategy has advantageous fuel consumption characteristics which are greatest at the most constrained feedgas levels. Drivability can be enhanced because of the greater calibration flexibility inherent to the adaptive tech nique.
