# Display device having a liquid crystal.

## Abstract
The liquid crystal display device 3 is provided with a measuring element 10 for controlling the drive voltages depending on the temperature of the liquid crystal. The effect of manufacturing tolerances and ageing phenomena are compensated for by means of an auxiliary measuring element 11 . The electric voltages across the measuring element 10 and the auxiliary measuring element 11 differing from one another, for the adjustment of mutually different operating points on the capacitance voltage curve 1 2 .
