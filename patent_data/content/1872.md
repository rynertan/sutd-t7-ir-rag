# Electromagnetic device, such as a relay, with a movable armature having a centre pole face and two end pole faces.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic device, such as a relay, having a stationary core 13 and a movable armature 24 , each having three pole faces 16, 16 , 17 29, 30, 28 , forms a magnetic circuit having three substantially parallel legs when the core 13 and the armature 24 are brought together. The centre leg, but not the two side legs, of the magnetic circuit includes a region of decreased magnetic permeability which separates the centre pole faces 17, 28 and which is constituted by an air gap and a non magnetic coating 49 on the centre pole face 28 of the armature 24 , which coating 49 is more resistant to wear than the material of the uncoated pole faces forming the two side legs of the magnetic circuit. The air gap and coating between the centre pole faces aids separation of the core 13 and armature 24 whilst avoiding excessive magnetic reluctance which would impair closing movement of the core 13 and armature 24 .
