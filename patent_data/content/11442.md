# Data processing system having an integrated stack and register machine architecture.

## Abstract
A data processing system including three resources, i.e., a memory 1 , a general purpose register file 5 having a plurality of elements R₀ R₇ and a stack 7 having a top TOS thereof. The system includes a first means for making the top of the stack TOS correspond to at least one of the elements R₀ R₇ in the general purpose register file 5 and a second means for controlling the operation of the stack 7 . When the element R₀ R₇ to which the top of the stack TOS is made to correspond is specified in an instruction register 11 of the system, the top of the stack TOS is selected to be accessed by the first means and the operation of the stack 7 is controlled by the second means.
