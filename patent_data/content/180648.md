## Description
The subject invention relates to polyester compositions being superior in flow property and melt stability on moulding, as well as in the mechanical properties of products moulded from them, particularly in impact resistance and hot air aging deterioration resistance, and to articles moulded therefrom. Having superior characteristics, aromatic polyesters that are represented by polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate are extensively used for manufacturing electric, electronic and automotive parts for example. However, their use has not increased because of the low impact resistance of products moulded from them. Therefore, it has hitherto been proposed to blend therein various kinds of polymer such as butadiene rubbers and acrylic elastomers. Among such known blends, those with copolymers composed of such monomers as α olefins and glycidyl esters of α, β ethylenically unsaturated acids which are mentioned in JP A 32045 1977, US A 4461871, JP A 58 71941 and JP A 91759 are comparatively superior to others in improving impact resistance and melt stability on moulding. JP A 58 71941 and JP A 91759 mention that small amounts of any of a wide range of additional polymers may also be included, including polycarbonates. Nevertheless, with these blends, there is a problem that articles moulded from them deteriorate in their impact resistance by hot air aging in an oven. Further, JP A 500870 1980 discloses blends of polybutylene terephthalates with aromatic polycarbonates and acrylic elastomers, but these still do not have satisfactory impact resistance despite a small improvement in this property and furthermore the compositions are inferior in melt stability. US A 4172859 discloses a blend of a polybutylene terephthalate with a copolymer containing ethylene, glycidyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate Example 7 and a blend of a polycarbonate with a copolymer of ethylene, propylene, 1,4 hexadiene and 2,5 norbornadiene 1 Example 13 . Elian Vohwinkel, Neue Polymere Werkstoffe fur die Industrielle Anwendung mentions that polybutylene terephthalate may be blended with other polymers, including polycarbonate, while JP A 51 089558 describes the addition to a blend of aromatic polyester and polycarbonate of thermoplastic soft resins such as olefin copolymer resins, polyethers and polyesters. JP A 125253 1982 discloses blends of polycarbonate with α olefin glycidyl acrylate or methacrylate polymers. However, a method of solving the above mentioned problems has, to date, not been found. The subject invention provides an aromatic polyester composition being superior to known aromatic polyester compositions in flow property and melt stability on molding, as well as providing moulded articles superior in mechanical properties, particularly in impact resistance and hot air aging resistance, which moulded articles are useful for manufacturing electric, electronic and automative parts. The polyester composition is composed of Preferably, the above composition additionally contains an ethylene based copolymer being composed of ethylene and α olefin having 3 to 10 carbon atoms. The invention will now be described in more detail. The compositions according to the invention contain aromatic polyesters and aromatic polycarbonates. The polyesters may be polymers or copolymers having aromatic rings in chains and prepared by condensing mainly aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their ester forming derivatives and diols or their ester forming derivatives . The above mentioned aromatic dicarboxylic acids include terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, ortho phthalic acid, 2,6 naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,5 naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, bis p carboxyphenyl methane, anthracenedicarboxylic acid, 4,4 diphenyldicarboxylic acid, diphenyletherdicarboxylic acid, 1,2 bis 4 carboxyphenoxy ethane and ester forming derivatives thereof. A part of the above mentioned aromatic dicarboxylic acids may be replaced with other aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as adipic acid, sebacic acid, azelaic acid, dodecanedionic acid, or alicyclic dicarboxylic acids such as 1,3 cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and 1,4 cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid or ester forming derivatives thereof, provided they are present in an amount of less than 40 mol percent based on the total acid component. The diols include aliphatic diols having 2 to 10 carbon atoms such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4 butane diol, neopentyl glycol, 1,5 pentane diol, 1,6 hexane diol, decamethylene glycol, cyclohexanedimethanol and mixtures of these. Further, a small amount of a long chain glycol having a molecular weight in the range of 400 to 6,000 such as polyethylene glycol, poly 1,3 propylene glycol and polytetramethylene glycol as well as mixtures thereof can be copolymerized with the above mentioned diols. Preferred aromatic polyesters in a composition according to the invention are polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyhexamethylene terephthalate, polycyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate and polyethylene 2,6 naphthalate. Most preferred among these is polybutylene terephthalate, because this provides mouldings having excellent mechanical strength. The aromatic polyesters should have a relative viscosity of 1.2 to 2.0, more preferably of 1.4 to 1.8 as measured in a 0.5 percent orthochlorophenol solution at 25 C. Insufficient mechanical strength is developed or no good luster surface mouldings are obtained when the relative viscosity of the polyester is less than 1.2 or more than 2.0 respectively. The aromatic polycarbonates present in compositions according to the subject invention are preparable by ester exchange or phosgene methods using dihydric phenols or their derivatives. The dihydric phenols are each represented by the following formula wherein Ar denotes an aromatic group such as phenylene, biphenylene and naphthylene Z denotes an alkyl group such as methyl and ethyl, a halogenated alkyl group, an aryl group such as phenyl and naphthyl, a halogenated aryl group, aralkyl group such as benzyl and phenylethyl, a halogenated aralkyl group, or an alicyclic group Y denotes an alkylene group such as methylene and ethylene, an alkylidene group such as ethylidene and isopropylidene, a tertiary amino group, O, S, SO, SO₂, CO or an amide group m and n are integers from 0 to 4 p is integer at least 1 q is 0 or 1 or r is 0 or a positive integer. When q is o, r is o. Illustrative of the dihydric phenols are The aromatic polycarbonate has a number average molecular weight of 10,000 to 80,000, preferably of 15,000 to 40,000. The compositions can neither provide mouldings having sufficiently good mechanical properties nor hot air ageing resistance if the number average molecular weight is less than 10,000, and compositions are inferior in moldability and provide mouldings having inferior mechanical properties if the number average molecular weight is more than 80,000. In a composition according to the invention, the aromatic polyester and aromatic polycarbonate are present in a weight ratio in the range from 90 10 to 10 90, preferably from 80 20 to 20 80, inclusive, respectively. In contrast, the synergistic effect of an increase in impact resistance of mouldings of polyester compositions and a resulting increase in hot air ageing resistance is small unless the respective amounts of polyester and polycarbonate are kept within the above mentioned ranges. The glycidyl group containing copolymers consists essentially of the α olefin and the glycidyl ester of an α,B ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid. Examples of the α olefin are ethylene, propylene and butene 1, of which ethylene is preferred. The glycidyl ester compound may be represented by the following general formula wherein R denotes a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or a glycidyl group substituted lower alkyl group. Glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, glycidyl ethacrylate and glycidyl itaconate are examples. Of these, glycidyl methacrylate is preferred. The amount of glycidyl ester in the copolymer is in the range of from 0.5 to 40 percent, preferably from 1 to 30 percent, more preferably from 2 to 20 percent by weight. If the content is less than 0.2 percent or more than 40 percent, the copolymers do not provide mouldings having a satisfactory increase in impact resistance nor do they provide compositions having a satisfactory decrease in moulding flowability. Glycidyl esters of α, β ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids can be copolymerized by standard copolymerization or graft reactions. Further, less than 40 percent by weight of at least one unsaturated monomer selected from monomers such as vinyl ethers vinyl acetate, propione and other vinyl esters methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl and other esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid acrylonitrile styrene and carbon monoxide may be copolymerized with the above copolymers. The MI Melt Index of the glycidyl group containing copolymer is in the range of between 0.1 and 100, preferably between 0.5 and 30, wherein the value of MI is measured at 190 C according to ASTM D 1238 and the unit is gr. 10 min. If the MI is less than 0.1 gr. 10 min. or more than 100 gr. 10 min. the increase in impact resistance is small. Preferred among glycidyl group containing copolymers are ethylene glycidyl methacrylate, ethylene vinyl acetate glycidyl methacrylate, ethylene carbon monoxide glycidyl methacrylate, ethylene glycidyl acrylate, and ethylene glycidyl acrylate vinyl acetate copolymers. Among them ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer is more preferred. The glycidyl group containing copolymers in a composition according to the invention are present in a an amount of from 1 to 80 parts by weight, preferably of 5 to 50 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the total weight of aromatic polyester and aromatic polycarbonate. If the amount is less than 1 part or more than 80 parts, polyester compositions do not provide moulded products having satisfactory increase in impact resistance or the mouldings deteriorate in mechanical properties. The compositions according to the invention provide mouldings having an even further increase in impact resistance when they are additionally composed of an ethylene based copolymer composed of ethylene and α olefin having 3 to 10 carbon atoms and or a diene copolymer being composed of ethylene, α olefin having 3 to 10 carbon atoms and unconjugated diene. The above mentioned α olefins include propylene, butene 1, pentene 1, 3 methylpentene 1, octacene 1, decene 1 and mixtures of two or more of these. Of these, propylene and butene 1 are preferred. The unconjugated dienes include various kinds of norbonene compounds, dicyclopentadiene compounds, tetrahydroindene compounds, 1,4 hexadiene and mixtures thereof. Preferred among these are 5 ethylidene 2 norbonene, dicyclopentadiene and 1,4 hexadiene. The molar ratios of ethylene to α olefin in the ethylene based copolymers are in the range between 40 60 and 99 1, preferably between 70 30 and 95 5, and in the diene copolymers the copolymerized ratios of α olefin and unconjugated diene are in an amount of from 5 to 80 mol percent, preferably from 10 to 60 mol percent α olefin and from 0.1 to 20 mol percent, preferably from 0.5 to 10 mol percent, conjugated diene. The ethylene based copolymers and or the diene copolymers are present in an amount of from 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 5 to 40 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the total weight of the aromatic polyesters and aromatic polycarbonates. The compositions according to the invention can provide mouldings having increased stiffness by further adding inorganic fillers. This addition generally causes a decrease in impact resistance in the moulded product. Such decrease is however small when moulding a composition according to the invention. Among the inorganic fillers, fibrous and granular ones as well as their mixtures can be mentioned. The fibrous ones include glass, silas glass, alumina , silicon carbide, ceramic, asbestos, gypsum, metal e.g. stainless steel and other inorganic and carbon fibers. The granular ones, on the other hand, include wollastonite, sericite, kaolin, mica, clay, bentonite, asbestos, talc, alumina silicate and other silicates metal oxides such as alumina as well as silica, magnesium oxide, zirconium oxide and titanium oxide carbonates such as calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate as well as dolomite sulfates such as calcium sulfate and barium sulfate glass beads boron nitride silicone carbide sialon. They are permitted to be hollow e.g. hollow glass fiber, glass microballoon, silas balloon, carbon balloon, etc. . Preferred among these are glass fibers, carbon fibers, metal fibers, potassium titanate whisker, glass flakes, glass beads, wollastonite, mica, talc, clay, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, calcium carbonate and barium sulfate. Particularly, among these glass fiber is more preferred. The inorganic fillers should preferably be treated with silane, titanate or another conventional coupling agent, and glass fibers with a conventional converging agent such as epoxy resin and vinyl acetate resin. The inorganic fillers are added at ratios, by weight, of 3 to 100 parts, preferably of 5 to 80 parts, per 100 parts by weight of the total weight of aromatic polyesters and aromatic polycarbonates. Compositions according to the invention can provide mouldings having increased impact resistance by adding compounds for prompting the reaction between epoxy compounds and carboxylic acids. They include triphenyl amine, 2,4,6 tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol and other tertiary amines triphenyl and triisodecyl phosphites and other phosphite esters triphenylallyphosphonium bromide and other phosphonium compounds triphenylphosphine and other tertiary phosphines lithium, calcium and other metal stearates sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and sodium 3,5 dicarbomethoxybenezesulfonate and other metal sulfonates and sodium lauryl sulfate and other organic sulfate salts. Their addition should be made at ratios of 0.001 to 5 parts by weight to 100 parts by weight of aromatic polyesters. Compositions according to the invention permit the addition of any one or more ingredients selected from fibrous and granular fillers and reinforcements, antioxidants, heat stabilizers, ultraviolet ray absorbents, lubricants, mold releasing agents, colorants including dyes and pigments, flame retardants and flame retarding assistants, antistatic agents, crystallization promotors, and other ingredients as well as small quantities of one, two or even more of thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins and thermoplastic elastomers, all provided that such ingredients are not present in sufficient quantities to adversely affect the properties of the composition. The processes for producing the compositions according to the invention are not limited. However, preferable among them is to melt extrude, by using an extruder, the dry blendings of aromatic polyesters, aromatic polycarbonates, glycidyl group containing copolymers and, if necessary, other additives. The resin composition of the invention can be moulded according to conventional methods such as injection moulding, extrusion moulding, and moulded articles therefrom show excellent properties. Embodiments of the invention are illustrated below in more detail with reference to Examples. Dry blendings of polybutylene terephthalate PBT having a relative viscosity of 1.56 and present in the amounts shown in Table 1 with aromatic polycarbonates derived from 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane and having different number average molecular weights and with glycidyl group containing copolymers of ethylene glycidyl methacrylate having different proportional amounts of the monomers and or different melt indexes were melt extruded and pelletized using a screw extruder set at 250 C. The melt viscosity of these pellets was measured at 250 C using a koka type flow tester. Subsequently they were moulded into ASTM No. 1 dumbbells and 1 4 in. 0.635 cm wide Izod impact testpieces using a 5 oz. 142g screw in line type injection molding machine. While injection molding, the minimum injection lower limit molding pressure required for mould charge was measured. The testpieces underwent tensile and notched Izod impact tests. Further they were kept heat treated in an oven at 150 C for 500 hours and subjected to tensile and notched Izod impact tests. The results are shown in Table 1. The results in Table 1 indicate that resin compositions provide moulded articles having increased impact resistance and superior hot air aging resistance if they contain both polycarbonates and glycidyl group containing copolymers having the characteristics and being present in the amounts required by the invention. Evaluation was carried out in the same manner as Example 3 except that 15 of the 25 parts by weight of the glycidyl group containing copolymer E was replaced with the ethylene based copolymers or diene copolymers shown in Table 2. The results are shown in Table 2. The results indicate that the resin compositions embodying the invention provide moulded articles having still further increased impact strength and compostions having still further improved moulding flowability when containing an ethylene based copolymer or diene copolymer. Dry blendings obtained by adding glass fibers 3mm long chopped strands in the amounts shown in Table 3 to polybutylene terephthalate PBT having a relative viscosity of 1.45 and the aromatic polycarbonate A and glycidyl group containing copolymer E used in Examples 1 were evaluated in the same manner as described in Example 1 except that the melt viscosity and lower limit moulding pressure were not measured. The results of these evaluations are also shown in Table 3. The results indicate that the compositions embodying the invention provide moulded articles having increased impact resistance and hot air aging resistance as well as stiffness if inorganic fillers are also added. Polyester compositions embodying the subject invention are useful, in particular, for manufacturing electric, electronic and automative parts.
