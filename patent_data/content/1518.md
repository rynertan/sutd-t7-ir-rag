# Strap wrench.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a strap wrench having a flexible work engaging element 11 pivoted to a handle 21 by a pair of links 14 to permit passage of the free end of the flexible element between the links, whereby the element may be wrapped in full circumscribing relation to a workpiece 37 . The handle has a camming surface 25 positioned to confront the exposed surface of the strap when it is wrapped around the workpiece and to engage the same and without moving parts to anchor the strap at that point when said handle is actuated to apply torque to the workpiece. The strap has a friction surface on the side confronting the workpiece and has a slip surface on the exposed side with lesser friction to permit the strap to slide over said camming surface prior to applying torquing action upon said handle to afford snug engagement of the strap with the workpiece. Preferably, the handle is formed of a one piece rigid plastics composition having a specific gravity which permits the wrench to float in water.
