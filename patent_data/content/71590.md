# Ground levelling unit.

## Abstract
When erecting a post or pillar 1 in a hole 2 which is to be refilled after erection, it is desirable to flatten or compress the filling 3 so that the post or pillar 1 will stand firmly. This is done in accordance with the invention by locating a transversely running elongate body 10 at the free end of the arm system 4 on a ground preparing machine, the free end of the body being suitably shaped for flattening, the flattening process being performed when the arm system 4 forces the free end of the elongate arm 10 against said filling.

## Description
Grbund levelling unitThe present invention relates to a ground levelling unit. Such a unit can be used when the ground surface or a pit is filled with filling material or weathering and the surface is to be flattened out. This can be performed with a roller or hand tools. It must be performed particularly carefully if a post or pillar is placed in a pit and the remaining space in the pit is filled with filling material. The filler must be compressed extremely well if the post or pillar is to remain in the desired position.In order to effect efficient levelling, according to the present invention use is made of the movable arm system of a ground preparing machine such as an excavator. The arm system is pivotably journalled about a substantially vertical axis at its attachment end in the ground preparing machine. The free end of the arm system is provided with an attachment means, movable about a axis perpendicular to the plane in which the arms of the arm system are movable. h unit is attached to said attachment means, said unit having a part which is movable about an axis perpendicular to the pivot axis of the attachment means. The latter part includes an elongate body arranged transversely in relation to the last mentioned axis and movable between a retracted position and an extended position. The free end of the elongate body is shaped to enable it to be used for flattening.Flattening is performed by said arm system moving the flattening end of the elongate body up and down on the surface of the ground.The elongate body can be used to flatten the ground around an upright post or pillar. In this case the elongate body must be moved around the erected post or pillar. It is thus suitable to provide the part provided with said elongate body with a guide means ensuring that, at the upward and downward movement of the elongate body, the body remains parallel to the upright object.The guide means is preferably designed as one or two sets of hinged jaws, said jaws being movable along the upright object when in closed position. If a single set of jaws is used, it should be wide enough to prevent the object forming an angle to the elongate body.If such a wide jaw is undesirable, two sets of jaws must be used instead, spaced from each other.Said jaws are also designed to clamp an object. They thus have two features the first being that they can clamp an object and the second that they can slide along an object. The jaws are thus used both for erecting an object such as a post or pillar, and for guiding the flattening process performed by the elongate body.Additional features of the present invention are revealed in the following claims.The present invention will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying two sheets of drawings, in whichFigure 1 shows the front part of the arm system of a ground preparing machine, to which a unit is attached com prising an elongate body for flattening and guide means for the flattening movement of the elongate body, the elongate body being shown in retracted position,Figure 2 shows the same arrangement as Figure 1, but with the difference that the elongate body is in extended posi tion, andFigures 3 and 4 show the arrangement in accordance with Figure 2 in use for flattening the ground surface around a post in two different positions around the post.The figures show the front end of the arm system 4 of a ground preparing machine, the rear end of the arm system being journalled in the groundpreparing machine in such a way that the arm system II is movably journalled about a vertical axis. The arm system as such is also movable in a plane parallel to said axis. At the front end of the arm system an attachment means 5 is pivotably journalled about an axis perpendicular to the plane in which the arm system is movable. The a attachment means 5 is infiuented by a link. system 6 by means of a hydraulic piston, not shown. A disc shaped unit 7 is secured to the attachment member 5.A part 8 is pivotably journalled to the unit 7 and moves about an axis which is perpendicular to the pivot axis of the attachment means. h sleeve 9 is arranged on the part 8, perpendicular to the pivot axis of the part 8. The sleeve 9 contains an elongate body 10 in the form of a rod with rectangular cross section. With the help of a pin 11 the rod can be retracted so that it is located inside the sleeve 9. The rod can also be brought into extended position with the aid of the pin 11, i.e. the position shown in Figure 2. At each end of the sleeve 9 is a jaw member 12 and 13, each member cooperating with a hinged jaw section 14 and 15, respectively. The two sets of jaws can be caused to surround a post or pillar 1 so that the unit 7 with jaws can move along a post or pillar 1.The unit 7 with jaws is also designed to permit firm clamping of the post or pillar 1. All movable parts in the described arrangement are presumed to be hydraulically controlled in known manner.The arrangement described above permits a post 1 to be placed upright in a pit 2 in a manner ensuring that the post will remain upright, this being done by a ground preparing machine being guided towards a lying post. The arm system with the jaws 12 and 15 is positioned so that the jaws 12 15 can grip the post 1 somewhere along its length. During this operation the elongate body 10 is in retracted position. The ground preparing machine is now manoeuvered to place the post in the pit 2. The pit is then filled with material 3. This filler 3 can be applied so that the post 1 stands more or less steadily. The jaws 12 15 can now release their grip on the post 1, sliding along the post 1 with minimum clearance. At the same time the elongate body 10 is brought to the position shown in Figures 3 and 4. The ground preparing machine is now caused to perform a movement forcing the elongate body straight up and down parallel to the post 1. While executing this movement the ground preparing machine is also caused to perform such a movement that the elongate body 10 also moves around the post 1 while moving up and down. The elongate body 10 will thus move around the post 1. The present invention thus enables a ground preparing machine, such as a conventional excavator, to be used to erect a post and also flatten the filling applied around the post, without the tool located at the front end of the arm system having to be complicated.
