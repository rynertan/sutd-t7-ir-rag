# Hip prosthesis as expanding femoral component.

## Abstract
A hip prothesis 3 is provided to fix in the femural articulation 2 , with gradual expansion on the wall of excavation by means of screw control. It shows a top emerging part with articulation conforma tion with seat for nut settling of screw control which inside in the lower cylindrical part 13 , has three longitudinal slots 14 . Within the lower cylindrical part 13 a conical, truncated part 4 is axially movable. When brought upwards, this part 4 causes the progres sive diverging of the three relevant expansion sectors of 13 which block the prothesis in the thigh bone canal. The integral condition is strengthened by circular retaining reliefs 15 , which fit against the cylindrical thigh bone canal.

## Description
Hip prothesis as expanding femoral component .The invention refers to a hip prothesis to be fixed in the femoral articulation,with uniformly shared expansion and to be adjusted on the cavity inner wall by means of screw control to act on from the projecting part.Following arthrosis,ischemical factors of the head,neck fracture,articulation tumours or other,the necessity occurs to replace the coxofemural articulation either partially or totally with a prothesis.For fixing it,several systems are used at present.One system employs acrilic qui ck settling cement with intense esothermic reaction. The sy stem may turn out inefficient due to the tissue necrosis and give rise to inconveniences of different kind on acco unt to reaction of the organism to cement,such as pressure lowering,psychical turbs and collapsial syndrome.Another system foresees a boring for adjusting the femural duct and fixing the prothesis in it through a screw device this system leads the prothesis to stir with the time due to unscrewing.The invented system permits the solution of the problem by excluding the fixing interposition product and by fitting the prothesis in the femoral canal by incorporating an ex panding device which operates with a graduable pressure and uniformly shared effect.This enables fitting integral ly operating of the prothesis to the skeleton avoiding pa rts differently stressed and rejection chances.In particular,the exclusion of the fixing product helps to avoid complication if the prothesis must replaced,through the difficulty of having to remove the cement from the ar ticulation,or the weakening of the femural cortical,or on account of tissues degenerated by the cement.The system substantially foresees an envelope with longit udinal development and inside cavity,the top part of which is projecting with an articulation shape,whereas the bott om one is cylindrical with longitudinal fents for giving rise to expansion sectors.A hollow positioning seat is fo reseen above for the control means through a screw axially fitted in the cavity binding a truncated cone for long itudinal gliding only which determines the progressive di verging of the expanding sectors by shape contact when li fting,so that these ones block, in an integrally operating way, the prothesis in the femural duct.The binding condition is strengthened by a system of circ ular horizontal retaining reliefs,externally fitted without interruption on the expansion part these reliefs are blocking the prothesis in the femural cavity according to a system of circular contact lines with solution of conti nuity,increasing in this way the integrally operating eff ect of composition.A not limiting version of execution is illustrated by the drawings of Table 1,where Fig.1 is the view of the prothe sis fitted into the femural duct with not activated expan ding device.The settling collar can be noted on the edge of the thigh bone,the control screw nut and the lower cy lindrical part with the retention reliefs and from the bo ttom of which the conical diverging part is projecting.Fig.2 is the longitudinal section of the prothesis.The version foresees the introduction of the metal part 3 into cavity 1 of the femural articulation 2 the said metal part fores ees below the truncated cone shaped part 4 with inside th readed conduit 5 for binding,with axial slide,screw 6 con trolled by nut 7 fitted in seat 8 with a view to lifting part 4.part 3 can be stabilized on the articulation by me ans slanting collar 9 which is settled on the middle coun terfort of the thigh bone lO,while part 11 is set with co ntact of the inside surface 12 of the femural large troca nther.The cylindrical bottom part 13 shows three longitud inal spaced fents 14 which in opening determine three expansion sectors following the rise of 4.On the outer wall, part 13 foresees a system of retention reliefs 15 without interruption to increase the effect of solidarily operating binding.For settling, the prothesis is at first fitted in the femural conduct,and the expanding effect is activa ted by acting on the control nut 7 bound in its seat to the rotation of its circular base 16 only,adjusted to cav ity 8.The prothesis can be completed with part 17 screwed on the lower cylindrical one 18 threaded on end 19 in coa xial seat 20.The execution particulars,the control device of the screw, the expanding sectors and everything else in this connect ion may be executed in a different way,similarly to the materials of possible employ which may be replaced by oth ers suited for the purpose. in particular the spherical he ad can be otherwise fitted through a kerf system.
