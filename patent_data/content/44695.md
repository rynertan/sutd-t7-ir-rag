## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION Blends of Algin, Tamarind, and A PolycationicElectroconductive PolymerDESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Blends of algin and tamarind have recently been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,257,768 and in EPO SN 79 302 481.1, filed November 6, 1979. The blend was taught to be useful in paper coatings. The polycationic electroconductive polymer used is Conductive Polymer 261, sold by CalgonCorporation, described in U.S. Patent 3,288,770, andTAPPI, Vol. 50, No. 1, 1967, pp. 26 38. This is a linear chain, repeating ring polymer having quaternary ammonium salt groups on the backbone. SSMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that blends of the algin tamarind with Conductive Polymer 261 improve the water retention, film forming, release less tackiness , and solvent holdout properties of the polymer. Amounts of algin tamarind relative to the amount of total solids of polymer plus blend range from 1.5 108 by weight, preferably about 1.6 4 by weight. The best algin tamarind blend is a 1 4 blend made as disclosed in EPO 79 302 481.1, supra. An example from that publication is as follows 20 80 Dry Blend Sodium alginate and tamarind kernel powder are dry mixed in the weight ratio 20 80. The mix is dissolved in deionized water by heating to 740C for 20 min. with stirring. The solution is cooled to room temperature and concentrations of 0.5 , 1 and 2 are prepared.PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The blend of algin tamarind in ConductivePolymer 261 is made by first dissolving the algin tamarind blend in water about 2 by weight concentration . Procedures for dissolving it involve slowly adding the blend with vigorous stirring at elevated temperatures to distilled water. Generally, a syrupy, translucent liquid results in about 15 min. This solution is then mixed with the commercial solution of Conductive Polymer 261 generally available as a 40 aqueous solution , in amounts so that about 96 97 of the final dry coating is Polymer 261 and about 4 3 is the blend. The actual working amount of solids in the paper coating composition is about 12 solids. This invention is illustrated by the following experimental description. A 2 by weight solution of a dry blend 4 1 of tamarind gum sodium alginate was prepared by slowly adding it with vigorous stirring at elevated temperatures to distilled water, and maintaining these conditions until it dissolves about 15 min .Subsequent solution was a syrupy, translucent, tan liquid. The other component used in the formulations was Conductive Polymer 261 Calgon CP 261LV 1500 cPs at 220C . The order of addition of components in each color is given in Table I. All formulations made down fairly easily with no major problems. The blend was mixed with CP 261LV at 3 97 weight ratio based on active solids and compared to plain CP 261LV in a typical size press color of 12.4 total solids. The drawdown evaluations were made on a 38 pound conditioned Camas rawstock. In each case, three drawdowns were made using a No. 3 Meyer rod and three were made using a No. 10 Meyer rod. The felt side was coated in all cases. Drawdown designations, basis weights and coat weights are listed in Table II. The usual coating, drying and conditioning techniques were used. Coatweights were obtained using an analytical balance before and after application of the color . A 2 dyed toluene solution was used in the solvent holdout evaluations, using the WeyerhaeuserChart was used to determine percent penetration.

Surface resistivity measurements at 20 and 50 relative humidity were nearly identical to the respective CP 261LV coated sheets, see Table III for additional details. Solvent holdout properties of drawdowns coated with the CP 261LV alginate tamarind blend formulations were significantly better than withCP 261LV alone, see Table III for details. At the concentration used with CP 261LV, the alginate tamarind blend appeared to have a significant beneficial effect in reducing sheet tackiness. Table IV gives details of experimental results. Alginate alone mixed with Polymer 261 is not compatible a gel forms which cannot be tested. Lack of sheet stiffness is a common problem in conductivized reprographic papers, especially at high relative humidities. Where this occurs, one solution is to increase the basis weight of the paper, which is of economic disadvantage. A property of the blends of this invention is that they stiffen paper when applied at the levels used for coating paper.
