## Description
CAOD R4V TUBE PROSPHORS This invention relates to cathode ray tube C.R.T. phosphors.In a cathode ray tube a visible image is formed on a face plate where a beam of electrons strike a phosphor layer. For many years it was possible to display a single colour only on an oscilloscope or television screen. With the advent of the shadow mask a colour television receiver was possible using three different phosphor dots on the tube face plate in register with each aperture in the shadow mask. The three dots emitted red, blue, and green light when hit by an electron beam.Many improvements have been made to phosphor materials but each colour still requires a different doped material with different emission characteristics for a given beam current.One use of a cathode ray tube is in aircraft as part of a head up dislay HUD where an image from a cathode ray tube is displayed in front of the pilot and focussed at infinity ahead of the aircraft. Since the displayed image must be observable in bright sunlieht, the cathode ray tube image must be capable of high brightness. This requires a high output phosphor with high breakdown strength and long life. Usually the display is coloured green because the human eye is most sensitive to this colour and it is at the eyes natural focus. According to this invention a cathode ray tube phosphor material is the material x Zno .T2Si07, where 1 x 0.42 doped with an emitting ion.The emitting ion may be Mn4 , or Eu3 to give a red emission,Mn2 , Tb3 green, blue, and red Ce3 blue. Without an emitting ion the emission is blue.According to an aspect of this invention a cathode ray tube comprises a tube having a face plate coated with w ZnO .Y2SiO7 doped with Tb3 .According to another aspect of this invention a television tube comprises a tube having a face plate coated internally with x ZnO .Y2SiO7 doped with different emitting ions in different areas to provide a multi coloured display.The differently doped areas may be deposited separately, or an undoped layer of z ZnO .Y2SiO7 may be deposited and the different areas doped through masks.The invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accanpanying drawings of which Figure 1 is a schematic view of a cathode ray tube figure 2 is a sectional view of a phosphor layer deposited on a support Figure 3 is a part front view of a three colour phosphor layer drawn to an enlarged scale Figure 4 is a schematic view of a head up display in an aircraft.To form the material x ZnO .Y2SiO7, ZnO is added to 2Si2O7. Above about 10 by molecular weight of ZnO e.g. x 0.42 the phosphor emits strongly. The value of s 1 corresponds to about 20 by molecular weight of ZnO in Y2Si207 i.e. ZnY2Si208. As seen in Figure 1 a cathode ray tube CRT 1 comprises an evacuated glass envelope 2 having a cathode structure 3 at one end and a front surface or face plate 4 at the other end. The inner surface of the face plate 4 is coated with a phosphor layer 5. A stream of electrons, of modulated intensity, is swept across the layer 5 causing an image to be displayed to an observer 6.When the CRT 1 is part of a colour television receiver a shadow mask 7 is arranged behind the face plate 4 and electrons pass through apertures in the shadow mask 7 before striking the phosphor 5.The phosphor coating 5 may be formed as follows oxides of zinc, yttrium, and silica, with or without an emitting ion are mixed and milled together to give a particle size around 50 cm. The mixture is fired at about 1,3500C for around 8 hours. This produces the material x ZnO .Y2S i07 which is then milled and sieved through a 10 tm filter to give a fine powder. The powder is mixed with dry alcohol and poured onto the face plate where the alcohol evaporated off heating to 4000C for around 30 minutes hardens the coating.For a single colour cathode ray tube an emitting ion such as Tb is mixed into the phosphor as noted above and a single complete phosphor layer formed.Alternatively where a colour television receiver is to be made three differently doped mixtures are prepared for deposition as small dots on the face plate 4. The dots are arranged in groups of threes, Figure 3, each dot in a group having one of the primary colours, red, blue, green. Each dot is formed through holes in a mask not shown onto the face plate 4 by settling or centrifuging a powder and alcohol mix. The single colour dot is then dried. Each dot in a group is formed separately through an appropriate mask. As an alternative to mixing with dry alcohol the fine powder may be mixed with a solvent, or binder, such as polyvinyl alcohol PVA and the liquid screen printed onto the face plate.An alternative way Figure 2 of producing differently doped areas on a face plate is to form a doped layer 5 of the host x Z O Y2SiO7 onto a platinum foil 8 supported on an alumina support 9 e.g. by settling from a dry alcohol suspension and firing at 1,5500C for 8 hours. A photolithographic mask is formed on the layer and an activator powder suspension poured onto the mask and fired at 1,350 C. This dopes the host at positions where holes in the mask allow diffusion of the emitting ion and host. The mask is removed and the process repeated for the two other emitting ions two other primary colours .The result is a t ZnO .Y2SiO7 ceramic, doped to give discrete areas of red, blue, and green emissions. This ceramic 5 is removed from the foil 8 and attached to the face plate 4 of a tube 1.Figure 4 shows a head up display PUD in an aircraft 10. The display comprises a CRT 1 which emits light towards a pilot 11 via lenses 12, 13 a fully reflecting mirror 14, and a partially reflecting mirror 15 behind the aircraft canopy 16. The CRT 1 image is focussed at infinity and is observed by the pilot 11 looking forward through the canopy 16 in the usual manner.
