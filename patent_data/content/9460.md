## Description
Piston in a piston type nursing device nursing bottle This invention relates to a piston in a piston type nursing or feeding device comprising a cylindrical receptacle having an opening at both ends, a rubber sucking mouthpiece secures to one end thereof, and a piston inserted slidably in the receptacle. A known conventional piston in a piston type nursing bottle is of a structure consisting of a short cylindrical hard plastic body having one closed end, an annular groove formed on the peripheral surface of said body, and a rubber seal ring fitted in the annular groove. However, this conventional piston has the defect that when the piston slides to its limit with the sucking of milk within the nursing device and further sucking of milk fails, a considerable amqunt of milk remains in the nursing device, especially at the mouthpiece portion. It is an object of this invention to improve the conventional piston in a piston type nursing device. According to this invention, there is provided a piston in a piston type nursing device, said piston comprising a short cylindrical body of a hard or semi hard material, an annular support portion projectingly provided concentrically on one end surface of said body, and a flexible elastic rubber sealer mounted detachably on said support portion, said sealer having an annular base mounted detachably on said support portion, a head cap portion extending from the inner circumferential edge of said base and concaved toward one end surface of said body, and an annular seal portion extending from the peripheral edge of said base. When the piston of this invention is used in a piston type nursing device and slides to its limit near the mouthpiece with the sucking of milk in the nursing device through the mouthpiece, further sucking from the mouthpiece causes the head cap portion of the piston to bulge elastically toward the sucking mouthpiece, and the bulging portion comes deep into the mouthpiece, thus enabling the milk to be sucked out with little remaining. When milk is to be filled in the nursing device, the piston has the advantage that because of the concave part of the head cap portion, milk can be filled in a larger amount corresponding to the concave part. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the drawings. Figure 1 is a vertical sectional view of a part of a nursing device having the piston of this invention inserted therein and Figure 2 is a vertical sectional view of another embodiment of the piston of this invention. In the piston of this invention, a body 1 is made of a hard or semihard synthetic resin such as polycarbonate or polypropylene, and a sealer 2 is made of a flexible elastic rubber such as a silicone rubber. The body 1 consists of a short cylindrical wall 3 and an end plate 4 provided at one end thereof, and on the end plate 4 is projectingly provided an annular support portion 5 having a smaller diameter than the body 1 concentrically with the body 1. An annular engaging portion for engagement with the sealer 2 is formed on the end of said support portion 5. Preferably, as shown in the drawing, the engaging portion is composed of an L shaped annular engaging member6 and an annular engaging member 7 projecting nearly parallel to the axial direction. The sealer 2 has an annular base 10 with a substantially C shaped cross section having annular engaging grooves 8 and 9 for detachably fitting the engaging members 6 and 7 therein. A head cap portion 11 integral with the base 10 and concaved toward the end plate 4 of the body 1 extends from the inner circumferential edge of the base 10, and an annular seal portion 12 integral with the base 10 for providing a seal between the piston and a nursing device extends from the peripheral edge of the base. The seal portion, for example, is formed in a circular cross section, and its peripheral edge extends in the peripheral direction somewhat beyond the annular wall 3 of the body 1. A knob 13 is provided on the undersurface of the center of the head cap portion 11, and is positioned within a hole 14 formed at the center of the body end 4. In operation, the piston is inserted into the cylindrical nursing device 15 a part of which is shown in Figure 1, and milk is filled into it. Since the head cap portion 11 is concaved toward the body end plate 4, the milk can be filled in a larger amount corresponding to the concavity. The peripheral surface of the wall 3 of the body 1 slidably makes contact with the inner circumferential surface of the receptacle 15 to maintain the entire piston in a right posture, and the peripheral surface of the seal portion 12 is urged elastically against the inner circumferential surface of the recep tacle 15 to form a seal between the piston and the inner circumferential surface of the receptacle 15. When the piston moves toward a rubber sucking mouthpiece 16 with sucking of milk therefrom, and reaches the end of the receptacle 15, i.e., its limit position beyond which it can no longer move, the head cap portion 11 of the piston elastically bulges toward the sucking mouthpiece 16 as shown by a two dot chain line by the sucking force from the mouthpiece 16. Thus, the pistoncomes into the mouthpiece 16 at the head cap portion, thereby enabling the milk remaining in the receptacle 15 and the mouthpiece 16 to be sucked out with little remaining. The bulging head cap portion 11 which has entered the sucking mouthpiece 16 by suction from the mouthpiece 16 is urged against the inside surface of the mouthpiece. When sucking of milk from the mouthpiece 16 is stopped in this state, a cruiciform cut 17 at the end of the mouthpiece 16 is closed to render the pressure of the space between the mouthpiece 16 and the bulging head cap portion 11 negative, whereby the head cap portion 11 remains adhering to the inside surface of the mouthpiece 16. Thus, when the cap 18 is disengaged from its threaded engagement with the receptacle 15 and the mouthpiece 16 together with the cap 18 is separated from the receptacle 15, the head cap portion 11 adhering closely to the mouthpiece 16 is pulled, and thereby, the piston is simultaneously pulled out of the receptacle 15. In the other embodiment shown in Figure 2, that portion of the head cap 31 in the sealer 22 which is near the annular base 30, i.e. the part of the head cap portion 11 which is bended when the head cap portion 31 is transformed from a concave shape to a bulging state, is formed in the shape of bellows 39. The reference numerals 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33 and 34 represent substantially the same portions as represented by the corresponding reference numerals in Figure 1. An annular small projection 40 of a semicircular cross section is provided on the peripheral surface of the seal portion 32.
