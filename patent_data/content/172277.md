# Thermoformable propylene polymer laminated sheet.

## Abstract
A propylene polymer laminated sheet comprises at least two layers wherein at least one surface layer A comprises 95 by weight or more of a specific crystalline propylene polymer and optionally up to 5 by weight of an inorganic or organic nucleating agent, the thickness of Layer A being from 0.5 to 45 of the total thickness of the sheet, and at least one other layer B comprises 40 to 95 parts by weight of a resin component and 60 to 5 parts by weight of an inorganic filler, the resin component comprising from 5 to 85 by weight of a specific crystalline propylene polymer and from 95 to 15 by weight of an ethylene polymer, the thickness of Layer B being from 55 to 99.5 of the total thickness of the sheet. This sheet is thermoformable and has excellent deep drawing properties and can produce a product having excellent surface gloss, appearance and impact resistance.
