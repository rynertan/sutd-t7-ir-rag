# PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA LYASE PRODUCING MICROBIAL CELLS

## Abstract
Mutant microbial strains, which are capable of overpro ducing phenylalanine ammonia lyase and are useful for the production of L phenylalanine, may be selected by growing cells on a minimal nutritional medium containing, as sub stantially the sole carbon source, a phenylalanine ana logue, said phenylalanine analogue being a substrate for PAL and the PAL catalyzed breakdown of said phenylala nine analogue being the rate determining step for its over all metabolism.
