# DOUBLE BLOCK WIRE ACCUMULATOR

## Abstract
A double block wire accumulator 1 having a draw block 2 on an outer shaft 3 , an accumulator block 4 on an inner shaft 5 , and a take off ring 6 with a turn back pulley 7 between the blocks 2, 4 , has a motor 10 for overdriving the accumulator block 4 for a period and a brake 11 for stopping rotation of the accumulator block and holding it stationary for a period, whereby a defective portion of wire can be transferred to the accumulator block 4 , then the latter can be held stationary while the defective portion of wire is cut out and the ends of the remaining good wire welded together, without stopping the draw block 2 , whereafter the accumulator block can be released, and if need be overdriven briefly, to restore normal running.
