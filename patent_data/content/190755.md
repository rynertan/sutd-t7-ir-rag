## Description
This invention relates to a novel compound which exhibits a high herbicidal activity with high selectivity, a novel herbicidal composition comprising as an active ingredient the novel compound which is useful as an effective herbicide for various crops and a method for the destruction of undesirable weeds using the novel herbicidal composition. More particularly, the present invention is concerned with an N substituted phenylteraconimide compound, a herbicidal composition comprising the compound and a method for the destruction of undesirable weeds using the herbicidal composition. To now, a herbicide comprising as an active ingredient an N substituted phenyl 3,4,5,6 tetrahydrophthalimide compound is well known as the generally called imide type herbicide to exhibit a high herbicidal activity see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,878,224 . However, the known imide type herbicides generally tend to be excellent in herbicidal activity but poor in selectivity. Hence, they are not suitable for practical use. The ideal herbicide should be one which further satisfies the following conditions in addition to the above stated excellent herbicidal activity and high selectivity. The toxicity of the herbicide to warm blooded animals must be low. The herbicide is effective even if it is applied any time through the whole period of growth of crop plants. Moreover, after usage, the herbicide decomposes as promptly as possible so that it does not contaminate the soil. However, such an ideal imide type herbicide which satisfies the above conditions is not yet known. Under the above stated current situation, the inventors have made intensive studies to develop a novel imide type herbicide which is free from the drawbacks accompanying the conventional imide type herbicides, which has selective and high herbicidal activity that means complete safety to crop plants and prompt elimination of any unnecessary weeds present therewith, which can be used continuously through the whole period of growth of crop plants. As a result, it has been found that a novel N substituted phenylteraconimide compound satisfies the above mentioned requirements for an improved herbicide, and that the compound, even at a low dosage, is very effective for a wide spectrum of crop plants, such as rice, wheat, corn, soybean and cotton plants. Based on this novel finding, the present invention has been completed. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel N substituted phenylteraconimide compound having a high selectivity as well as a high herbicidal activity. It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel herbicidal composition containing the novel compound.
