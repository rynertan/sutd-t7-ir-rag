# Rubber toughened polyvinyl alcohol films.

## Abstract
Polymer compositions are provided which may be cast as thin, self supporting films, useful in forming sealed envelopes or pouches containing granulated pulverulent or non aqueous liquid materials. The cast films comprise a polymeric matrix, having at least about 50 weight percent polyvinyl alcohol, and a plurality of microdomains dispersed throughout the polymer ic matrix. The films have good resistance to breakage at low temperatures and low relative humidities.
