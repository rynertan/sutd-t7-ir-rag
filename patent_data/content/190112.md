## Description
This invention relates to the field of moving a tool through a three dimensional space to perform work at various locations in the three dimensional space and more particularly to a teaching device used with the tool to program a computer so that the computer will move the tool through the three dimensional space, along a predetermined path and with a desired relative relationship to the work. In order to move a tool through a three dimensional space and along a predetermined path to do work continuously or at certain locations, it is necessary to program a computer. In prior art practices, this has been accomplished by moving the tool along the surface of the path through which the tool is to be moved while feeding programming information to the computer. One problem associated with this method is that the tool may strike obstacles in the path causing undesirable changes in the angular relationship of the tool to the surface so that the tool would not perform its work properly at such locations. Also, the tool could be damaged. It has been proposed to secure a teaching device to the tool so as to protect the tool while being moved along the path and in contact with the surface. Such a device, while protecting the tool, still suffered the drawback of inadvertantly changing the angular relationship of the tool or even moving it too far out of the intended path if an obstacle was encountered. Also, the structure of the teaching device sometimes prevented the positioning of the tool at the desired angular relationship. The present invention refers to a teaching device for teaching a computer a program for moving a welding torch through a three dimensional space along a path defined by the juncture of two workpieces, the teaching device comprising a body having a free end portion and a hollow end portion. FR A 2 311 630 discloses a teach in method and an apparatus for use in an industrial robot. In the teach in operation a tracing tip is removably attached to the leading end of a robot arm, so that a disc shaped sensor may follow the weld groove. In the playback operation the tracing tip must be removed and a welding torch has to be attached in place thereof. Moreover it is not possible to fully change the angular position of the disc shaped sensor for an appropriate simultaneous determination of the lead and drag angle of the welding torch, as an angular movement of this sensor with respect to the direction of the weld groove will often be obstructed by the shape of the groove. The present invention aims at an improvement of the teaching device and is characterized in that the hollow end position is adapted to be moved over the welding torch and to be held by it and that a ball is secured in a holding means disposed at the free end portion, the ball extending beyond the free end and adapted to contact a portion of the workpieces during movement of the teaching device through the path. The teaching device according to the invention is attached to the welding torch which has not to be removed from the robot arm during the teach in operation which is time saving. Moreover because of the ball shaped sensor the teaching device allows a positioning of the welding torch in a desired angular relationship to the groove and, if desired,also the change of this angular relationship. The teach in time is shortened and the desired movement of the welding torch is more accurately programmed. It is a further object of this invention to provide a teaching device so that the desired space and angular relationship of the welding torch to the surface, where the workpieces are to be performed, is maintained. The ball shaped sensor permits a substantially friction free movement of the teaching device over the means defining the predetermined path while in contact therewith so that if any obstacles are encountered the teaching device will move over such obstacles with little or no tendency for the angular relationship of the tool to be changed. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the teaching device is provided at one end with a socket for attachment to the tool. The other end of the teaching device is provided with a cavity in which cavity there is seated a steel ball. The cavity has a cylindrical surface having a diameter less than the diameter of the ball and a length less than half the diameter of the ball so that the major portion of the ball is outside of the cavity. A magnet is located adjacent to the cavity so as to hold the ball in the cavity but permit rotation of the ball in the cavity. In order to keep friction at a minimum, the surfaces defining the cavity are formed from a smooth hard material such as polytetrafluoroethylene Additionally, the preferred embodiment includes an electric circuit operatively associated with the tool and teaching device for preventing damage to the teaching device when the tool and teaching device are connected together. The circuit itself includes a portion of the teaching device and the circuit is used to control the state or position of a switch electrically connected to a source of power used in heating a welding wire provided with the tool. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred embodiments as illustrated in the accompanying drawing in which like reference characters refer to the same parts through the various views. The drawing is not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention. In Fig. 1, there is a schematic illustration of a welding torch 2 that is moved through a three dimensional space, along a predetermined path and with a desired relative relationship to the work in order to perform work by suitable mechanisms not shown . Such a tool may be part of a robot used in welding. In such a welding robot, the end portion 4 of the torch 2 is mounted in a holder not shown . The welding torch 2 comprises an electrode 6 covered by a layer of insulating material 8 and encased within a flexible metallic sheath 10. The end 12 of the electrode 6 is connected to an insulated socket 14 having a threaded electrical connection 16. An electrode tip 18 is in threaded engagement with the electrical connection 16. The thickness of the metallic sheath 10 is reduced adjacent to the end portion 20 so as to form an annular shoulder 22 for a purpose described below. Welding wire 24 is pushed through the electrode 6 and the electrode tip 18 by a cooperating pair of feed wheels 26 and 28. A teaching device 30 is illustrated in Fig. 2 and comprises at one end a hollow end portion 32 defined by a cylindrical wall 34. The inner diameter of the wall 34 is slightly larger than the outer diameter of the end portion 20. The hollow end portion 32 is in communication with a cylindrical cavity 36 that has an inner diameter slightly greater than the outer diameter of the electrode tip 18. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the teaching device 30 has been moved over the welding torch 2 so that the electrode tip 18 is in the cavity 36 and in contact therewith and the end portion 20 is in contact with the inner surface of the wall 34. The teaching device 30 is in the desired position when the end 38 of the wall 34 is in abutting relationship with the annular shoulder 22. It is understood that configurations other than cylindrical may be used so long as the corresponding parts are compatible. At the other end, the teaching device 30 has a cylindrical cavity 40 as illustrated in Fig. 3. Mounted in the innermost portion of the cavity 40 is a magnet 42. Also mounted in the cavity 40 is a cup 44 having a base 46 and a cylindrical wall 48 forming a cylindrical cavity 50. The base 46 is in contact with the magnet 42. A ball 52 is seated in the cavity 50. The ball 52 is formed from a magnetic material so that the magnet 42 functions to pull the ball into the cavity until it is in contact with the base 46. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the inner diameter of the wall 48 is less than the outer diameter of the ball 52 and the length of the cavity 50 is less than half the outer diameter of the ball 52 so that the major portion of the ball 52 is located outside the cavity 50. In the preferred embodiment, the cavity is cylindrical and the relative dimensions of the cavity and the ball are chosen so that the ball 52 is in contact with the base 46 and the wall 48. However, it is to be understood that other geometrical configurations may be used. The cup 44 could be formed with a triangularly shaped base 46 and side walls 48 with the resulting cavity 50 shaped to stop longitudinal movement of the ball 52 into the cavity 50 and to prevent relative movement between the ball 52 and walls 48. In this construction, there would be only four points of contact between the ball 52 and the cup 44. In addition to the teaching or programming feature associated with the present invention, the preferred embodiment also includes an electric circuit used in controlling power to the welding torch 2. This circuit protects the teaching device 30 and the welding torch 2 from damage or destruction that could occur, for example, if the teaching device 30 was inadvertently left on the welding torch 2 and the welding robot was activated for the purpose of providing desired welding. The electric circuit is used in controlling the state of a switch 54 that is electrically connected between the computer, or other controller that controls the operation of the welding robot, and a source of DC power. When the switch 54 is in an open position, welding electrical current will be supplied to the electrode 6 but when the switch 54 is in its closed position, welding electrical current is not applied to the electrode 6. The electric circuit used in opening and closing the switch 54 includes a source of AC power 56, a transformer 58, a rectifier 60 and a relay 62. One side of the rectifier 60 is connected by line 64 to the electrode 6 while the other side of the rectifier 60 is connected to one side of the relay 62 by line 66. The other side of the relay is connected to the metal sheath 10 by line 68. When the teaching device is not on the welding torch 2, the switch 54 is open and the DC power is applied to the electrode 6 permitting welding electrical current to be applied to the electrode 6 causing the welding wire 24 to be heated for welding. When the teaching device 30 is positioned on the welding torch 2, contact is made between the electrode tip 18 and the walls of the cavity 36, and contact is also made between the end portion 20 of the metal sheath 10 and the inner surface of the well 34 so that the lines 64 and 68 are connected together causing current to flow through the circuit and activate the relay 62 to close the switch 54. In the case of the switch 54 being closed, the DC power is effectively short circuited so that no damaging electrical power is applied to the welding torch 2 and the teaching device 30 while the teaching device is connected to the welding torch 2. The circuit illustrated in Fig. 1 is also useful when the welding robot is in operation. In Fig. 4, the structure of the welding torch 2 when in operation is illustrated. A gas shield 70 comprising a hollow cylinder 72 has been positioned with the inner surface of the hollow cylinder 72 in contact with the end portion 20 of the metallic sheath 10. An annular space exists between the elctrode tip 18 and the inner surface of the hollow cylinder 72 so that in normal operation the switch 54 is in the open position. During the operation of the welding robot, there sometimes occurs a build up of slag on the inner surface of the hollow cylinder 72. If the build up of slag becomes excessive to the point that electric current can flow between the slag and the electrode tip 18, the circuit in Fig. 1 would be completed and the relay 62 would be activated to close the switch 54 and cut off the welding electric current to the electrode 6. The operation of the preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 3 wherein the teaching device 30 has been moved into position on the end of the welding torch. In the illustration in Fig. 3, the means defining the path comprises a piece of metal 74 which has been positioned in contact with another piece of metal 76 and it is desired to weld the pieces 74 and 76 together along the path defined by the juncture 78 of the pieces 74 and 76. The teaching device 30 has been moved into contact with the pieces of metal 74 and 76 so that there is contact between the ball 52 and the pieces of metal 74 and 76 at only two points. In a normal welding operation, it is desirable to change both the lead or drag angle and the weld angle and to position the electrode at the proper distance from the work. This means that to properly program the computer, it must be possible to pivot the teaching device about a point in any direction. Since the major portion of the ball 52 in this invention projects outwardly from the cavity 50, it is possible to pivot the teaching device 30 in any direction so as to change the lead or drag angle and the weld angle. Since only point contact is established between the ball 52 and the pieces of metal 74 and 76, the movement of the ball 52 over the surfaces of the pieces of metal is substantially frictionfree. Also, the teaching device is designed to space the electrode tip 18 at the proper distance from the work. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the ball 52 is a common steel bearing ball and the cup 54 is formed from polytetrafluoroethylene or other similar material.
