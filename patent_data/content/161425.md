The following results, including standard errors, which were obtained using ten disks for each of the control solution and the tested examples, show that the compositions of Examples 3 and 4 caused significant mean log10 count reductions of bacteria on the disks. Mean Log Mean Log Count Reduct1n of Count of Bacteria Bacteria from Example Recovered Disk Control Disk 3 4.77 0.18 1.43 0.18 4 4.58 0.12 1.62 0.12 Monkey Paw Scrub Test The antimicrobial effect of the compositions of Examples 1 4 on the normal bacterial flora of the hands of anesthetized cynomolgous monkeys was measured. Each hand was tested separately and randomly and was first scrubbed for two minutes with Camay brand of bar soap in warm tap water, rinsed for one minute in running warm tap water, washed for two minutes with Camay brand of bar soap in warm tap water, rinsed for two minutes in running warm tap water, and dried with a sterile towel, then sampled for microflora before being scrubbed with the test composition. Sampling was done by placing a sterile latex surgical glove over the hand, pouring into the glove 100 ml.of aqueous phosphate buffered 0.07 M, pH 7.8 sampling fluid containing Triton X 100 brand of polyethylene glycol p isoctylphenyl ether 0.1 , massaging the hand in the sampling fluid for one minute, and diluting an aliquot 10 ml. of the sampling fluid with an equal volume of aqueous phosphate buffered pH 7.2 Tamol N Micro brand of condensed naphthalenesulfonic acid sodium salt anionic dispersant 2 neutralizer solution. The volume of the neutralized sample was this 20 ml. The hand was then washed for 45 seconds and scrubbed for 15 seconds with 5 ml. of the test composition, rinsed for 30 seconds under warm running tap water, washed for 90 seconds and scrubbed for 30 seconds with an additional 5 ml. of the test composition, rinsed again for 30 seconds under warm running tap water, dried with a sterile towel, and sampled again. This procedure was repeated three times for a total of four times during eight hours with a minimum of one hour between procedures scrubs . No sample was taken after the third scrub. Triplicate aliquots 1 ml. each of each neutralized sample and each of three successive tenfold dilutions thereof were then plated by the pour plate technique on soybean casein digest agar. The plates were incubated aerobically at 370C. for 48 72 hours, then counted using an automated colony counter Model 880 Artek Systems Corp. interfaced with a computer PDP 15 , whereby the data were processed by program and are expressed below as mean log10 count reductions from after the bar soap scrub and before the first test composition scrub Pre Scrub 1 to after the first Post Scrub 1 , second Post Scrub 2 and fourth Post Scrub 4 test composition scrubs and as overall mean logs0 count reductions. The following results including standard errors were obtained using 20 hands for each of Examples 1 2 and 24 hands for each of Examples 3 4 and show significantly and progessively greater reductions in microbial counts at each of the post scrub sampling times for each of the compositions.
