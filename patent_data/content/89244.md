# Light beam position control apparatus.

## Abstract
This relates to a tracking servo apparatus for controlling the position of a light beam to follow an information track on an information storage disk. In response to a drive signal, a light beam displacing means such as a galvanomirror 30 or movable lens 32 moves the light beam to the disk 34 transversely with respect to the information track. A photodetector 42 detects the intensity difference of the light beam in half sections and produces a radial error signal. The radial error signal is corrected 52, 56, 46 in response to the drive signal which was applied to the light beam displacing means, and then a new drive signal is produced depending upon the corrected radial error signal.
