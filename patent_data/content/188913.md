## Description
A METAL CONTAINING CATALYST COMPOSITION, ITS SYNTHESIS ANO ITS USE This invention relates to a metal containing catalyst composition, its synthesis and its use in processes such as catalytic reforming, dewaxing, dehydrogenation of paraffins and olefin hydrogenation. Zeolitic materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversion. Certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a definite crystalline structure as determined by X ray diffraction, within which there are a large number of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by a number of still smaller charnels or pores.These cavities and pores are uniform in size within a specific zeolitic material. Because the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as molecular sieves and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion containing crystalline aluminosilicates. These aluminosilicates can be described as a rigid three dimensional framework of SiO4 and AlO4 in which the tetrahedra are cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms, whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1 2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing alumina is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal or an organic cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio of aluminum to the number of various cations, such as Ca 2, Sr 2, Na, K or Li, is equal to unity. One type of cation may be exchanged entirely or partially with another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner.By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosilicate by suitable selection of the cation. The cavities and pores are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration and or possibly by organic species from the synthesis mixture in the as synthesized materials. A convenient measure of the extent to which a zeolite provides control to molecules of varying sizes to its internal structure is the Constraint Index of the zeolite. Zeolites which provide a highly restricted access to and egress from its internal structure have a high value for the Constraint Index, and zeolites of this kind usually have pores of small size. On the other hand, zeolites which provide relatively free access to the internal zeolite structure have a low value for the Constraint Index. The method by which Constraint Index is determined is described fully inU. S. Patent No. 4,016,218. Prior art techniques have resulted in the formation of a great variety of synthetic aluminosilicates. These aluminosilicates have come to be designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as illustrated by zeolite A U. S. Patent No. 2,882,243 , zeolite X U.S. Patent No. 2,882,244 , zeolite Y U.S. Patent No. 3,130,007 , zeolite ZK 5 U. S. Patent No. 3,247,195 , zeolite ZK 4 U. S.Patent No. 3,314,752 , zeolite ZSM 5 U. S. Patent No. 3,702,886 , zeolite ZSM ll U. S. Patent No. 3,709,979 , zeolite Zoo12 U. S.Patent No. 3,832,449 , zeolite ZSM23 U. S. Patent No. 4,076,842 ,ZSM 35 U. S. Patent No. 4,016,245 , ZSM 38 U. S. Patent No.4,046,859 , ZSM 48 EP 8 15132 and Zeolite Beta U. S. Patent Nos.3,308,069 and Re. 28,341 . The Si w A12Q3 ratio of a given zeolite is often variable. For example, zeolite X can be synthesized with Si A12รป3 ratios of from 2 to 3 zeolite Y, from 3 to 6. In some zeolites, the upper limit of Si A1203 ratio is unbounded. ZSM 5 is one such example wherein the SiO2 A12 ratio is at least 5, up to infinity. U. S. Patent No. 3,941,871, now Re. 29,948, discloses a porous crystalline silicate made from a reaction mixture containing no deliberately added alumina and exhibiting the X ray diffraction pattern characteristic of ZSM 5 type zeolites. U. S. Patent Nos. 4,061,724, 4,073,865 and 4,104,294 describe crystalline silicates or organosilicates of varying alumina and metal content. The prior art also discloses methods for incorporating into zeolitic materials strong hydrogenation dehydrogenation metal components, as illustrated by metals such as molybdenum, chromium and vanadium, and Group VIII metals such as cobalt, nickel, platinum and palladium. U. S. Patent No. 3,201,356 describes a method for activating a crystalline zeolitic molecular sieve catalyst composited with a noble metal component which involves dehydrating the catalyst to a water content of less than 1.8 wt X at a temperature below 1600C 3200F , and thereafter heating the catalyst in the presence of hydrogen at a temperature of about 1600C 320 F . U. S. Patent No. 3,700,585 in columns 7 and 8, reviews the typical ion exchange techniques employed for introducing metal cations into zeolite structures, such as the techniques described inU. 5. Patent Nos. 3,140,249 3,140,251 and 3,140,253. As a general procedure, a particular zeolite is contacted with a salt solution of the desired replacing cation.The zeolite is then preferably washed with water, dried at 650 3150C, and calcined in an inert atmosphere at 260 815 C. U. S. Patent No. 3,956,104 describes a hydrocracking catalyst which is prepared by a series of steps which include 1 admixing ammonium hydroxide and aluminum sulfate in an aqueous medium to form a soluble aluminum sulfate partial hydrolysis product 2 admixing a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite with the partial hydrolysis product, effecting complete hydrolysis of the aluminum sulfate, and aging the resulting mixture for about two hours 3 separating and washing the solids and 4 impregnating the solids with calculated quantities of Group VIB and Group VIII metal components, and calcining the resulting composite. U. S. Patent No. 4,148,713 describes the preparation ofZSM 5 type of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites which have particles coated with an aluminum free outer shell of silica.Optionally, the zeolites can contain metal cations of hydrogenation components such as Group VI and Group VIII metals. U. S. Patent No. 4,174,272 describes zeolite catalysts containing platinum group metals, which are employed in nonhydrogenative endothermic catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons in a system wherein the endothermic heat required for cracking is supplied by the catalyst as the heat transfer medium. The prior art crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites of the type described above generally exhibit acid activity in their hydrogen form and have a relatively low silica alumina ratio. Acidity and ion exchange capacity are related to the aluminum content of a zeolite. A high silica alumina zeolite exhibits relatively low acid activity in the hydrogen form. The shape selective properties of the prior art zeolites are adapted for acid catalyzed reactions, such as cracking of hydrocarbons. Prior art zeolites are not particularly effective for shape selective metal catalyzed reactions. U. S. Patent Nos. 4,269,813 4,327,236 4,285,919 and 4,331,641 describe the preparation of boron containing ZSM 5 zeolite in which boron is introduced in the crystalline lattice structure.Published British Patent Application No. 2,024,790 describes modification of ZSM 5 type crystalline materials in which boron, chromium, beryllium, titanium, vanadium, manganese, iron, cobalt, zinc, zirconium, rhodium, silver, tin and antimony have entered the crystalline lattice of the silica in place of silicon. Introduction of boron and various other metals into the lattice structure ofZSM 5 is also disclosed in Published British Patent ApplicationNo. 2,033,358. As is common practice in zeolite synthesis, the boron containing materials are prepared hydrothermally by crystallization from a gel or opaque reaction mixture. In one aspect, the present invention resides in a shapeselective metal containing catalyst composition comprising a porous crystalline silicate which has a Constraint Index between 1 and 12 and which contains boron in tetrahedral coordination in its crystal lattice and a metal from Group VIII of the Periodic Table ofElements, the catalyst composition containing less than 0.1 weight of elemental aluminum on an ash basis. In a further aspect, the invention resides in a method as as claim 7. A method for preparing a shape selective metalcontaining catalyst composition comprising contacting an ionexchangeable form of a porous crystalline silicate which has aConstraint Index between 1 and 12 and in which boron is present in tetrahedral coordination, with an aqueous solution of a Group VIII metal compound to exchange and or sorb said metal in ionic form into the silicate, the final composition containing less than 0.1 of elemental aluminum by weight of the composition on an ash basis. The catalyst composition of the invention can employ any porous crystalline silicate containing boron in its crystal lattice and having a Constraint Index of 1 to 12. Suitable silicates include boron containing high silica forms of the zeolites ZSM ll,ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, ZSM 48, Zeolite Beta, and most preferably ZSM 5. Since the final catalyst composition contains less than 0.1 wt , and preferably less than 0.05 wt , of elemental aluminum, the SiO2 to A1203 ratio of the such zeolites will be at least 900, preferably at least 1800, and most preferably at least 5000. The Si02 to B203 ratio can suitably range from greater than 10 up to 10,000. Suitable boron containing highly siliceous zeolites can be prepared in known manner from a reaction mixture containing a source of silica substantially free of alkali metal, an organic directing agent, such as a quaternary ammonium compound, a boron oxide forming compound for example, boric acid , water, and conveniently at least 0.001 by weight of seed crystals of the required zeolite. No alumina is added to the reaction mixture, although some minor amount of aluminum may be present, for example as an impurity in a component of the mixture. Crystallization is then carried out under either static or stirred condition in polypropylene jars or in stainless steel autoclaves, conveniently at a pH of 10 14 and a temperature of 800 to 1800C for 6 hours to 150 days. The resultant boron containing zeolite is then calcined at 200 6000C to remove the organic directing agent. In view of its high SiO2 to A 4 ratio, the resultant zeolite even in the hydrogen torm typically has an alpha value less than 10 as measured by the conventional hexane cracking test described in, e.g., U. S.Patent 3354078. The resultant boron containing highly siliceous zeolite is then contacted with an aqueous solution of at least one Group VIII metal salt to exchange or sorb ionic Group VIII metal into the boron containing material. Preferred Group VIII metals are iron, platinum and palladium. Illustrative of suitable platinum salts are chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and platinum amine complexes. Contact with the Group VIII metal salt solution is arranged to incorporate in the zeolite between 0.01 5 wt , and preferably between 0.1 5 wt , of the Group VIII metal. In this respect, the teri intrazeolitic , as employed herein with respect to metal content, refers to the metal contained within the internal cavities and channels and pores characteristic of a crystalline zeolite structure. Following contact of the boron containing material with the aqueous solution of Group VIII metal compound, the zeolite material normally is washed with water and dried at a temperature of about 1100C. The Group VIII metal, boron containing material is then thermally treated by heating in contact with a reducing, oxidizing or inert environment. For example, the environment can be air, hydrogen, unsaturated hydrocarbon, nitrogen, or the like. The thermal treatment is conducted at a temperature in the range 1000 5000C, normally for a period of time between 0.2 2 hours. When an unsaturated hydrocarbon reducing agent is employed in the thermal treatment, it is selected from acyclic and cyclic mono and poly unsaturated C3 C20 alkenes and alkynes. The preferred olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbons are acyclic and cyclic C3 C12 mono unsaturated alkenes. Illustra tive of suitable olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbons are propene, 2 methylpropene, butene, butadiene, pentene, pentadiene, hexene, heptene, octadiene, dodecene, propyne, hexyne, cyclopentene, cyclopentadiene, cyclohexene, vinylcyclohexene and cycloheptene. After the thermal treatment, the Group VIII metal, boron containing material can be base exchanged with a Group IA metal cation. The base exchange with Group IA metallic cations, such as lithium, sodium, potassium or cesium, is for the purpose of reducing the acidity of the Group VIII metal containing zeolite substrate, for example, acidic sites generated during the thermal treatment. The base exchange can be accomplished by slurrying the material in an aqueous solution of a suitable Group IA compound, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium chloride, and cesium hydroxide. As desired, the base exchange can be arranged, by suitable selection of reagent concentration, pH, contact time and the like, to eliminate part or substantially all the base exchangeable acidic content.Such a base exchanged Group VIII metal, boron containing material is essentially non acidic , and exhibits substantially no acidcatalyzed reactivity when employed as a catalyst in hydrocarbon conversion systems. The base exchanged material can be recovered from the base exchange medium and dried in a conventional manner. The resultant catalyst composition is particularly suitable for combination with a silica binder to produce a silica bound aggregate. However, other refractory oxide binders can also be used, such as zirconia, magnesia, and titania, although since the first catalyst composition must contain less than 0.1 by weight on an ash basis of elemental aluminum, conventional alumina binders should be avoided. The metal containing high silica zeolite catalyst composition of the invention exhibits shape selective hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization properties. These properties appear to be attributable mainly to the relative absence of acidic content, and also to the presence of Group VIII metal which is distributed within the intrazeolitic structure. The Group VIII metal is situated within the internal channels and pores of the crystalline zeolite. The intrazeolitic Group VIII metal is capable of catalyzing shape selective hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation and aromatization reactions of mixed hydrocarbon feeds.Further, because of the intrazeolitic nature of the Group VIII metal content, the zeolite catalyst composition of the present invention exhibits increased resistance to bulky poisons and reduced aging, relative to other types of supported Group VIII metal catalyst compositions. Although it is not fully understood, there appear to be at least two factors which account for the shape selective Group VIII metal reactivity in the catalyst composition of the invention. First, the high silica zeolitic substrate in the calcined as synthesized form has an unusual capability to ion exchange GroupVIII metal into the crystalline matrix. At least a several fold excess of Group VIII metal cations can be incorporated in the zeolite, above that which is theoretically projected on the basis of the aluminum content of the zeolite. It is believed that the excess ion exchange capacity of a high silica zeolite may be at least partly attributable to the presence of ion exchangeable silicate ions occluded within the intrazeolitic structure. Secondly, it appears that thermal treatment of the GroupVIII metal containing zeolite, provided it is conducted within the temperature range specified, does not cause any substantial migration of the internally disposed metal atoms out of the intrazeolitic matrix to the crystalline surfaces. This is important since externally situated metal atoms do not exhibit shape selective reactivity. The term shape selective metal function , as employed herein, refers to the ability of a zeolite composition to convert linear C6 C50 hydrocarbons to aromatics more readily than cyclic hydrocarbons convert to aromatics, that is, with a linear cyclic hydrocarbon conversion ratio of greater than 1.0. The zeolite catalyst composition of the invention exhibits shape selective metal reactivity, as distinct from shape selective acid reactivity as disclosed in the prior art. One suitable test for determining whether a zeolite catalyst composition has a shape selective metal function involves passing an equimolar mixture of n heptane and cyclohexane in a nitrogen stream over the catalyst composition at 5000C. The catalyst composition has a shape selective metal function if, under the test conditions, the conversion of n heptane is greater than the conversion of cyclohexane, while the aromatic product derived from n heptane exceeds the aromatic product derived from cyclohexane. An alternative test involves passing an equimolar mixture of 1,2 dimethylcyclohexane and 1,4 dimethylcyclohexane in a hydrogen stream over the zeolite catalyst composition at 3500 to 4000C. The catalyst composition has a shape selective metal function if, under the test conditions, the molar ratio of p xylene to o xylene in the product is greater than 2.0 at less than 50 conversion of the l,4 isomer. The catalyst composition of the present invention is particularly useful for hydrocarbon conversions, and in particular for hydrogenation of olefins, dehydrogenation of paraffins, reforming and dewaxing. The operating conditions for these conversions are conventional and known to those skilled in the art. The present invention will now be further illustrated by the following examples in which all proportions are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Example 1 100 grams of 25 tetrapropylammonium hydroxide in water was added to 12.4 grams of acid washed SiO2 55 ppm Al and heated to 1000C to dissolve the silica. 2.75 grams of a solution made from 11.4 grams H3B03 and 18 grams NaOH in 50 grams H20 was added with stirring at 800 1000C to the silicate solution, resulting in a gel, which was then heated in an autoclave for 5 1 2 days at 1700C.The yield of crystalline product was 4.9 grams. Example 2 A silicate solution was prepared as above. To this solution was added 2.75 grams of a solution made from 5.7 grams tl3B03 and 34 grams of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide. The resulting clear mixture was heated in an autoclave for 5 days at 1700C. The yield of crystalline product was 9.3 grams. Example 3 The experiment in Example 2 was repeated, except that 5.5 grams of the H3B03 solution was used. The yield of crystalline product was 10.1 grams. Example 4 100 grams of 20 tetraethylammonium hydroxide was added to 12.4 grams of acid washed SiO2 and heated to l000C. To the resulting silicate solution was added 5.5 grams of a solution made from 5.7 grams H3B03 and 34 grams of tetraethylammonium hydroxide. The clear solution was heated in an autoclave for 5 days at 1700C. The yield of crystalline product was 9.5 grams. Examples 1 4 above illustrate the preparation of boron containing highly siliceous crystalline materials having theX ray diffraction pattern of ZSM 5. In Example 1 sodium was intentionally added, whereas in the synthesis mixtures of Examples 2 4 no sodium was intentionally added. The advantage of not adding sodium is clearly seen, because the yields are then almost doubled and in one preparation, Example 3, more than doubled. Analysis by lle NMR indicated the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated boron replacing silicon in the zeolite framework. The dried product material consisted of large 1 micron size or more single or slightly twinned crystals with platelet morphology. The X ray diffraction pattern was highly resolved, indicating high sample crystallinity.Scanning electron micrograph pictures did not show contamination of the crystalline product with gel like impurities. The product analysis of Examples 1 4 are indicated in Table 1 below. Example 5 Platinum was incorporated into the calcined product ofExample 3 by ion exchange with a solution of 100 mg Pt NH3 4C12 dissolved in 25 ml H20 per 1 g of calcined product. Pt content after ion exchange was 0.71 Pt. The platinum catalyst was then heated in oxygen at l 20C min to 3000C and maintained at 3000C for 1 hour prior to use. Example 6 Hydrogenation of an equimolar mixture of hexene l and 4,4 dimethyl hexene 1 at 3000C over the catalyst composition ofExample 5 resulted in 99 hexene hydrogenation, whereas less than 0.6X of the dimethyl hexene was hydrogenated. This high selectivity is indicative of Pt located inside the channels of the Boron ZSM 5. TABLE 1SAMPLE EX. 1 EX. 2 EX. 3 EX. 4Form As synth. As synth. As synth.
