These compounds are active as fungicides and are particularly effective in controlling a variety of fungi which are deleterious to plants, including plant fungal infections. Some of these compounds are useful in controlling leaf blights caused by organisms such as Phytophthora infestans, Septoria apii, Alternaria solani conidia, and powdery mildews such as that caused byErisiphe polygoni. However, some of the compounds of this invention may be more fungicidally active than others against particular fungi. In addition, some of the compounds of this invention show antibacterial activity and may inhibit bacterial growth. When used as fungicides, the compounds of the invention are applied in fungicidally effective amounts to fungi and or their habitats, such as vegetative hosts and non vegetative hosts, e.g., animal products. The amount used will, of course, depend on several factors such as the host, the type of fungus, and the particular compound of the invention. As with most pesticidal compounds, the fungicides of the invention are not usually applied full strength, but are generally incorporated with conventional, biologically inert extenders or carriers normally employed for facilitating dispersion of active fungicidal compounds, recognizing that the formulation and mode of application may affect the activity of the fungicide.Thus, the fungicides of the invention may be formulated and applied as granules, as powdery dusts, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as solutions, or as any of several other known types of formulations, depending on the desired mode of application. Wettable powders are in the form of finely divided particles which disperse readily in water or other dispersants. These compositions normally contain from about 58 to 80 fungicide, and the rest inert material, which includes dispersing agents, emulsifying agents and wetting agents. The powder may be applied to the soil as a dry dust, or preferably as a suspension in water.Typical carriers include fuller s earth, kaolin clays, silicas, and other highly absorbent, readily wettable, inorganic diluents. Typical wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents include, for example the aryl and alkylaryl sulfonates and their sodium salts alkylamide sulfonates, including fatty methyl taurides alkylaryl polyether alcohols, sulfated higher alcohols and polyvinyl alcohols polyethylene oxides sulfonated animal and vegetable oils sulfonated petroleum oils fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and the ethylene oxide addition products of such esters and the addition products of long chain mercaptans and ethylene oxide. Many other types of useful surface active agents are available in commerce. The surface active agent, when used, normally comprises from 1 to 15 by weight of the fungicidal composition. Dusts are freely flowing admixtures of the active fungicide with finely divided solids such as talc, natural clays, kieselguhr, pyrophyllite, chalk, diatomaceous earths, calcium phosphates, calcium and magnesium carbonates, sulfur, lime, flours, and other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the toxicant. These finely divided solids have an average particle size of less than about 50 microns. A typical dust formulation useful herein contains 755 silica and 25 of toxicant. Useful liquid concentrates include the emulsifiable concentrates, which are homogeneous liquid or paste compositions which are readily dispersed in water or other dispersant, and may consist entirely of the fungicide with a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier such as xylene, heavy aromatic naphthas, isophorone, and other nonvolatile organic solvents. For application, these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier, and are normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. Other useful formulations for fungicidal applications include simple solutions of the active fungicide in a dispersant in which it is completely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene, or other organic solvents. Granular formulations, wherein the fungicide is carried on relatively coarse particles, are of particular utility for aerial distribution or for penetration of cover crop canopy.Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in finely divided form as a result of vaporization of a low boiling dispersant solvent carrier, such as the Freons, may also be used. All of those techniques for formulating and applying fungicides are well known in the art. The percentages by weight of the fungicide may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied and the particular type of formulation, but in general comprise 0.St to 95t of the toxicant by weight of the fungicidal composition. The fungicidal compositions may be formulated and applied with other active ingredients, including other fungicides, insecticides, nematocides, bactericides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, etc. A further understanding of the invention can be had in the following non limiting Examples. Wherein, unless expressly stated to the contrary, all temperature ranges refer to the Centigrade system and the term ambient or room temperature refers to about 200C to about 250C. The term percent refers to gram moles. The term equivalent refers to a quantity of reagent equal in moles, to the moles of the preceding or succeeding reagent recited in that example in terms of finite moles or finite weight or volume. Also, unless expressly stated to the contrary, geometric isomer and racemic mixtures are used as starting materials and correspondingly, isomer mixtures are obtained as products.
