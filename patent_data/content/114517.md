# Mark position detecting method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a mark position detecting apparatus, a rectangular reference mark is performed on a workpiece or photomask 12 . The apparatus includes a movable table 10 for supporting the photomask 12 , a stationary light source 30 for radiating light for forming a light spot on the photomask 12 , a photodetector of a signal detector 40 for detecting a change in light component transmitted through the mask 12 , and a computer control section 16 . The table 10 moves forwardly and reversely in a Y direction so that the photodetector scans two opposite edges of the reference mark in opposite directions in the Y direction. The table 10 is then moved forwardly and reversely in a X direction so that the photodetector scans other two opposite mark edges. The signal detector 40 thus produces edge position data 46 representing the four mark edge scaned. The computer control section 16 computes the coordinates of the mark center based on the edge position data 46 .
