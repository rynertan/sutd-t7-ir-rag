## Description
DESCRIPTION HYDROGENATION OF ESTERS USING ALKALI DOPED HETEROGENEOUS GROUP VIII TRANSITION METAL CATALYSTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVBITION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a process for hydrogenating carboxylic acid esters to primary alcohols in solution under mild conditions utilizing alkali dopedGroup VIII metal catalysts supported on carbon.2. Brief Description of the Background of the Invention Including Prior Art Carboxylic acid esters, as a class, are not readily susceptible to hydrogenation to produce primary alcohols under mild conditions. Generally, severe conditions are required, such as temperatures well above 1500C together with reaction pressures in the order of 13.8 MPa to 20.7 MPa 2000 3000 psig . In addition, the hydrogenation process generally requires a catalyst which is frequently not selective, such as Raney nickel, copper chromite, or zinc chromium oxide. See OrganicReactions, Vol. 8, pages 1 27 John Wiley, 1954 . Catalytic hydrogenation of carboxylic acid esters represents an important industrial source of primary alcohols, which are useful in a wide variety of known applications such as in producing gums, resins, perfumes, wetting agents and the like. For example, l decanol is commercially produced by catalytic hydrogenation of coconut oil fatty acids and their esters under high pressure. Sulfonated derivatives of 1 decanol are useful as surface active agents. Also, 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol, CF3CH2OH, useful as an intermediate in producing the anesthetic, CF3CHClOCHF2, is produced by the heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of 2,j,2 trifluoroethyl trifluoroacetate, CF3COOCH2CF3, as described in U.S.P. 4,072,726 Nychka et al. toAllied Chemical Corporation, 1978 . A. Ozaki et al. in U.S.P. 3,770,658 issuedNovember 6, 1973 disclose a catalyst comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of transition metals belonging to VI B group, VI I B group and VIII group of the Periodic Table and at least one element selected from the group consisting of alkali metals belonging to the I A group of the Periodic Table, both elements being substantially in the metallic state. This catalyst has not been employed in the hydrogenation of esters. An example of soluble hydrogenation catalysts is disclosed in our copending, commonly assigned UnitedStates Patent application Serial No. 070,583 filedAugust 29, 1979 which discloses a method for preparing anionic group VIII metal hydride complexes by reacting a neutral group VIII metal complex, or adduct thereof, with a group IA metal cation radical anion complex also called metal arene such as potassium naphthalene, in a solvent therefor, such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether. New and improved catalysts for catalytic hydrogenation of carboxylic esters to primary alcohols are constantly being searched for. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns a method for preparing a catalyst comprising contacting a group VIII metal deposited on carbon with a member of the group consisting of alkali metal arenes, alkali metal ketyls, alkali metal alkoxides and their mixtures in the presence of a polar solvent. The present invention also includes a solid catalyst composition consisting essentially of about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of at least one Group VIII transition metal, about 1 to about 25 weight percent of at least one alkali metal, about 1.5 to about 75 weight percent of an anion selected from the group consisting of arene radical anions, ketyls, alkoxides and mixtures thereof, and the balance a support comprising high surface area carbon. The present invention also includes two hydrogenation processes wherein a carboxylic acid monoester is reacted in the liquid phase with a gaseous hydrogen in the presence of a solid catalyst at a temperature not exceeding about 1500C. In the first process, the solid catalyst is the solid catalyst composition of the present invention. In the second process the solid catalyst is a composition consisting essentially of about 0.3 to about 99 weight percent of at least oneGroup VIII transition metal, about 0.1 to about 50 weight percent of at least one alkali metal and the balance an inert support comprising high surface area carbon. The present process can hydrogenate an ester group in a cyclic or acyclic saturated aliphatic monoester, thereby converting the acid moiety of said ester to a primary alcohol group. The present process is particularly applicable to hydrogenating esters with an aromatic acid moiety such as methyl benzoate in that the acyl carbon can be hydrogenated to an alcohol without hydrogenating the aromatic ring, i.e. to benzyl alcohol rather than to cyclohexyl methanol. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In defining the catalyst composition of the present invention and the catalyst for the present processes, weight proportions of metals are given and, in some instances, weight proportions of an anion are given. High surface area carbon, e.g. activated carbon, is indicated as a support. The amount of such carbon required or permitted is that sufficient to give a high surface area to the other materials. It should not, however, be considered that the carbon is unessential since, in fact, the advantages of the present invention are not achieved when such carbon is not present. It is permissible, however, to employ inert materials, or even other activator or promoter materials, as well as carbon as additional support components. The present invention is not limited to catalysts and processes wherein the Group VIII and alkali metals are in a neutral or metallic valence state.Rather it is believed that the alkali metal and theGroup VIII metal are in various valence states within the rante 1 to 1 in the active catalyst. Hydrogenation reaction conditions are capable of converting these metals to such valence states from some, but not all other valence states. The alkali metal is introduced into the catalyst either as a metal or as a very strong base, e.g. in combination with the anions recited as part of the novel catalyst composition. The term consisting essentially of is intended to exclude from the composition materials which are acidic in character and can neutralize the strongly basic nature of the above anions. In the cata lyst for the second process, which has no such anion, it is believed that a similar function may be performed either by the alkoxide formed once alcohols begin to appear as the result of hydrogenation, or by arene radical anions within the carbon support. The term liquid phase is used to describe the hydrogenation processes to indicate that the ester is either dissolved in a solvent or used as a neat liquid. The catalyst is in the solid phase and the hydrogen is partitioned between the gas phase, the liquid phase and the solid phase. Group VIII metal deposited on carbon. A number of ways well known in the art can be employed to deposit the group VIII metal onto the carbon. Soluble salts of group VIII transition metals can be dissolved in an aqueous solution. Then carbon is added to the solution and the solution is stirred for a time period of about 10 minutes to 48 hours. Then the water is removed, e.g. by vacuum evaporation. For example a group VIII metal halide can be distributed on carbon by an aqueous solution with the water being removed by heating and evacuation. The deposited metal halide is then reduced to the metal at about 3000C to 5000C in a reducing atmosphere. A preferred reducing atmosphere is provided by molecular hydrogen and a preferred temperature range is from about 3500C to 4500C. The group VIII metal on carbon can then be activated for catalyzing hydrogenation reactions of esters by reaction with group I metals or certain groupI metal compounds. Alkali metal activated group VIII transition metal carbon catalysts. Various ways are available for activating the group VIII metal on carbon with group I metals. For obtaining group VIII transition metal catalysts activated by an alkali metal, the group VIII metal dispersed on carbon is reacted with the desired alkali metal in an inert or reducing atmosphere or in vacuum. Preferably the alkali metal is dispersed on the group VIII metal carbon by condensation from the vapor phase. This can be achieved by heating the alkali metal in the presence of the group VIII metal on carbon to temperatures from about 2000C to 5000C and preferably from 3500C to 4500C, under vacuum or in an inert atmosphere. Alternatively alkali metal activated groupVIII metal carbon catalysts can be obtained by employing liquid ammonia as a solvent medium for the alkali metal, which is then contacted with the group VIII metal carbon composition. The solution is filtered after sufficient reaction time and then the ammonia is evaporated by slowly heating under reduced pressure vacuum to temperatures of about 1200C to 1600C until the ammonia evaporation terminates. Alkali metal compound activated group VIII transition metal carbon catalysts. Catalysts made according to the present invention include group VIII transition metal carbon catalysts activated with alkali metal arenes, alkali metal ketyls, alkali metal alkoxides and their mixtures. For obtaining group VIII transition metal catalysts activated by an alkali metal arene, the groupVIII transition metal on carbon catalyst should preferably be pretreated with hydrogen at 350 4500C. A metal arene is prepared by reacting an alkali metal e.g. sodium with an arene e.g. naphthalene in an inert polar solvent. The pretreated catalyst is then contacted with the alkali metal arene in the presence of an inert polar solvent. The reaction is performed at a temperature of from about 1000C to 1000C. Thereafter, the resultant catalyst can be washed with the polar solvent to remove any free arene or free alkali metal arene. The solvent may be removed and the preparation then dried in vacuum or, alternatively, the catalyst can be used in the solvent in which it is prepared i.e.in situ . For obtaining group VIII transition metal catalysts activated by an alkali metal ketyl, the following procedure may be used. The alkali metal ketyl can be prepared by reacting the alkali metal with the ketone in a polar inert solvent at a suitable temperature for a sufficient time. In general, the reaction temperature can be from about 1000C to 1000C. The alkali metal ketyl activated group VIII transition metal catalysts are preferably prepared by dispersing the group VIII transition metal carbon composition in an inert polar solvent and then adding the alkali metal ketyl, optionally also dissolved in an inert polar solvent. The reaction mixture is preferably agitated and kept at a temperature of about 1000C to 1000C for sufficient time to complete the reaction, such as 1 70 hours. The solid catalyst formed can be washed with an inert polar solvent to remove excess ketyl or used in situ. For obtaining group VIII transition metal catalysts activated by an alkali metal alkoxide, the group VIII transition metal on carbon catalyst can be contacted with an alkali metal alkoxide in the presence of an inert polar solvent. The reaction is performed at a temperature from about 1000C to 1000C. These catalysts are preferably used in situ without removing solvent . Polar inert solvents useful in the preparation of the catalysts include tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, dioxane, 1,2 dimethoxy ethane and other polyethers which lack free hydroxyls. The term solvent is intended to mean a liquid which dissolves the alkali metal containing reactant, since the Group VIII metal on carbon remains in the solid phase. Tetrahydrofuran and 1,2 dimethoxyethane are preferred. The Group VIII metals present in the subject compositions include iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, iridium and platinum and preferably ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and platinum, especially ruthenium and rhodium. The alkali metal may be lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium or cesium, preferably lithium, sodium or potassium, most preferably potassium. Representative examples of alkoxides applicable in the invention compositions are triphenylmethoxy, diphenylmethylmethoxy, 2,2 diphenylethoxy, 1,2,2 triphenyl ethoxy, diphenylmethylmethoxy, trimethylnaphthyl, triethylnaphthyl, trioctadecylmethoxy, tri n octylmethoxy, triisopropylmethoxy, tri secondary butylmethoxy, tricyclohexylmethoxy, tri pentamethylphenyl methoxy, tri p tolyl methoxy, tri p n octadecylphenyl methoxy, tri p n octylphenyl metboxy, tri 2 phenethyl methoxy, tri benzylmethoxy tri 2 phenyl isooctadecyl methoxy, tri p methoxyphenyl methoxy, tri 2 methoxyethyl methoxy, tri p tertiary butoxyphenyl methoxy, 1,2,3 triphenylpropoxy, dimethylanthryl 1,2 diphenyldioxy l,2 , phenoxy, benzoxy, naphthoxy, anthroxy and phenanthroxy. Acyclic alkoxy is preferred.Most preferred are methoxy, ethoxy and trifluoroethoxy, with other C1 and C2 straight chain alkoxy or fluorinated alkoxy being also preferred. The arene radical anion is the radical anion of an aromatic compound containing 6 to 24 carbon atoms and can be formed from benzene, toluene, naphthalene, biphenyl, xylene, anthracene, phenanthrene, their aryl substituted derivatives, and the like. Substituents on any aryl ring. which tend to donate electrons to the ring or form reactive groups under conditions of catalyst preparation or hydrogenation are not suitable. In general only inert aliphatic, ether or dialkylamino substituents are permitted, and unsubstituted arenes are preferred. The most preferred aromatic is naphthalene.Arene radical anions from biphenyl, anthracene and phenanthrene are also somewhat preferred. Representative examples of alkali metal radical anion compounds include lithium naphthalene, sodium naphthalene, potassium naphthalene, cesium naphthalene and potassium biphenyl. Such alkali metal arene radical anion compounds can be prepared by reacting an alkali metal with a suitable aromatic compound i.e. arene in a suitable inert polar solvent. Thus a preferred alkali metal arene radical anion compound is an alkali metal e.g. potassium naphthalene prepared by reacting the metal with naphthalene in an inert polar solvent such as tetr ahydrofuran. Aryl type substituents of the arenes include biphenyl, benzyl, tolyl, xylyl, cumyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl and diphenyl. The alkali metal ketyl activators include alkali metal ketyl wherein the ketyl part derives from a keto group attached to at least one aromatic group and preferably attached to two aromatic groups. Examples for such ketones include benzophenone, phenyl tert butyl ketone, phenyl naphthyl ketone, dinaphthyl ketone. A preferred ketyl is the ketyl prepared from benzophenone and an alkali metal. If a ketone has a carbon adjacent the carbonyl with a hydrogen bonded to the adjacent carbon, then the reaction product will be an alkali metal enolate rather than an alkali metal ketyl. For purposes of the present invention, such alkali metal enolates are equivalent to alkali metal ketyls. Thus alkali metal enolates prepared by reacting an alkali metal such as potassium with a ketone such as acetone, methyl phenyl ketone, cyclohexyl phenyl ketone, phenyl isopropyl ketone and the like are suitable and may, because of the tautomerism between structures, be considered equivalent to ketyls. Furthermore, alkali metals dissolved in liquid ammonia can also be used to prepare parts of the catalysts of the present invention. To prepare catalysts useful for the second process of the invention, the group VIII transition metal should be supported on a high surface area carbon and then reacted with an alkali metal dopant. The GroupVIII transition metal part is placed in a state substantially free from materials leading to decomposition of the strongly nucleophiiic doping reagent. After contacting the supported Group VIII transition metal with the alkali metal dopant, the resulting mixture is reacted at a temperature of from about 1000C to 1000C, with temperatures from about 784C to 250C preferred, in a polar solvent, usually an ether. In the novel catalysts and first process of the present invention, the broad weight percent ranges set forth above about 0.1 to about 15 percent GroupVIII transition metal, about 1 to about 50 weight percent alkali metal and about 2 to about 50 weight percent anion are intended to accommodate the varying densities and sizes of the various possibilities. For lithium, for example, about 1 to about 5 by weight is preferred, and about 2 to about 3 is more preferred.For sodium and potassium, about 2 to about 208 is preferred, with about 7 to about 10 being more preferred for sodium and about 8 to about 12 being more preferred for potassium. For cesium, about 10 to about 50 is preferred, and about 40 to about 50 is more preferred.All of the above percentages are by weight. The balance is a support which can be essentially all activated carbon. Anions are likely to be present in molar proportions no more than the alkali metal. A lesser amount of arene can be introduced by reacting the supported Group VIII transition metal with both free alkali metal and alkali metal compound with any of the anions discussed above. In the second process of the invention, the preferred broad percentages are about 0.1 to about 25 Group VIII transition metal, about 0.5 to about 60 alkali metal and the balance support. Preferred ranges are about 1 to about 5 for lithium, about 2 to about 25 for sodium or potassium and about 10 to about 50 for cesium. More preferred are about 2 to about 3 for lithium, about 7 to about 10 for sodium, about 8 t6 about 12 for potassium and about 40 to about 50 for cesium. Again, the balance is a support which can be essentially activated carbon. In both cases, if granular catalyst particles are used, then the above proportions need only refer to the exterior layer of the surface which is in intimate contact with the reactants. Apparatus for Catalyst Formation Apparatus which is used to carry out the process of catalyst formation can be of any conventional type in which the steps of addition of reagents, heating, cooling, isolation and purification procedures can be carried out under an inert dry atmosphere and include the use of conventional dry boxes, glove bags and conventional vacuum equipment. Apparatus which is useful is an H shaped hollow glass evacuable cell in which the horizontal portion serves as a filtering device and the vertical sides of the H serve as the reaction vessel. Catalytic Hydrogenation of Esters By the terms hydrogenation catalyst and catalyst composition as used herein, is meant the compositions described above. One aspect of novelty of these improved processes is the discovery that the subject compositions are surprisingly effective catalysts for the respective catalytic heterogeneous hydrogenations in which the esters are in the liquid phase neat or otherwise . A preferred solvent for the esters is tetrahydrofuran. Carboxylic acid esters, comprised of an acid moiety and alcohol moiety and by the term alcohol moiety , is meant to include aromatic hydroxy moiety, e.g., phenols and naphthols as well which are applicable in this invention process, include those wherein the acid moiety is derived from a C2 C18 linear or branched alkyl monocarboxylic acid, C2 C6 linear or branched alkyl dicarboxylic acid, C7 C8 cycloalkyl monocarboxylic acid, C2 C4 fluorinated monocarboxylic acid, containing 1 7 fluorine atoms, and said alcohol moiety of said ester is derived from a C1 C4 linear or branched alkyl alcohol, C1 C4 linear or branched fluorinated alcohol, containing 1 7 fluorine atoms,C7 Cg aralkyl alcohol, or C6 C10 aromatic hydroxy compound.

It is to be understood that esters produced from combinations of the above described acids and alcohols in known manner are deemed to be.applicable within the scope of this invention process.Representative examples of esters useful in the invention process are methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl n octadecanoate, isobutyl decanoate, t butylnonoate, phenyl acetate, 2 naphthyl propionate, methyl cyclohexylcarboxylate, ethyl cyclohexylacetate, n butyl fluoroacetate, methyl difluoroacetate, n propyl trifluoropropionate, methyl trifluorobutyrate, isopropyl acetate, sec butyl propionate, fluoromethyl acetate, difluoromethyl acetate, l,3 difluoro 2 propyl octanoate, benzyl acetate, phenethyl acetate, methyl trifluoroacetate and trifluoroethyl trifluoroacetate. Preferred examples of esters in the invention process are methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, methyl trifluoroacetate and trifluoroethyl trifluoroacetate and methyl benzoate. Particularly preferred ester in the invention process is trifluoroethyl trifluoroacetate. In addition to the esters described hereinabove, cyclic inner esters , i.e. lactones, are also applicable in the invention process, which can be hydrogenated to yield diols, useful in the synthesis of polyesters. The scope of lactones applicable in the invention process include C3 C12 alkyl lactones, such as propiolactone, butyrolactone, valerolactone, octanoic lactone, caprolactone and 1,12 dodecalactone. Preferred are alkyl lactones in which the lactone functional group is formed between the first and terminal carbon atoms in the precursor hydroxy alkyl carboxylic acid. Thus, caprolactone can be hydrogenated to yield 1,6 hexanediol and the above described lactones will yield diols in like manner. The amount of carboxylic acid ester substrate present in the process is not critical and is generally about 1 to 100,000 parts by weight of substrate per part of catalyst composition and preferably, about 10 to 1,000 parts by weight of ester substrate per part of catalyst composition. However, larger or smaller amounts of substrate may effectively be used. The process can be conducted in the neat state, i.e. no solvent, providing Said ester is liquid at the reaction temperature employed. However, it is preferred to conduct the reaction in the presence of an inert solvent for the carboxylic ester substrate Solvents which are applicable in the invention process must be inert toward hydrogenation under the reaction conditions and should preferably be anhydrous, and include C6 C12 benzenoid hydrocarbons, and C2 C18 alkyl derivatives thereof, C5 C10 linear or branched saturated aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbons, C4 C6 saturated aliphatic cyclic mono or diethers and C2 C6 linear or branched saturated aliphatic mono or diethers, C7 C14 aromatic ethers, or mixtures thereof. Representative examples of specific solvents useful in the invention process of ester hydrogenation are benzene, toluene, xylene, hexamethylbenzene, biphenyl, n octadecylbenzene, pentane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, hexane, isooctane, decane, cyclodecane, tetrahydrofuran, p dioxane, 2,5 dimethyltetrahydrofuran, methyl tetrahydrofurfuryl ether, dimethyl ether, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, diglyme, diethylether, diisopropyl ether, anisole, diphenyl ether, and mixtures thereof. Preferred solvents in the process of the invention are toluene, benzene, cyclohexane, hexane, tetrahydrofuran, p dioxane, diethyl ether or 1,2 dimethoxyethane. A particularly preferred solvent is tetrahydrofuran. The amount of solvent, when used, is not critical provided sufficient solvent is present to dissolve the carboxylic acid ester substrate and to initiate and maintain the hydrogenation reaction. In general, about 1 to 100 parts by weight of solvent per part of ester is used, although not limited thereto, larger or smaller amounts being effective with the above proviso. Temperature in the process is normally in the range from about OOC, two about 1500C and preferably in the range of about 250 to 1000C. However, higher temperatures can also be employed and are considered to be equivalent to the stated preferred ranges. The pressure in the reaction process may be 100 to 1100 kPa 0 psig to 150 psig at the reaction temperature however, higher pressures can be employed and may improve the conversion of esters to alcohols as illustrated in Example 23 below. The process is conducted under an atmosphere containing hydrogen gas, being the active reducing agent. The atmosphere above the reaction mixture can also contain an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, mixtures thereof, and the like, as long as sufficient hydrogen gas is present to maintain the hydrogenation reaction. The process can be conducted in conventional batch reactors e.g. a stirred tank or flow reactors e.g. a trickle bed reactor . Conversions of esters in the process range from 5 to 100 of theory based on the starting amount of ester substrate and the particular ester used. Selectivities in the process for production of primary alcohols from esters are in the range of about 90 to 100 , being defined as moles primary alcohol produced divided by moles ester hydrogenated x 100. The product primary alcohol can be isolated from the process and purified by conventional methods such as extraction, followed by fractional distillation or column or gas chromatographic techniques. Apparatus for conducting ester hydrogenation process can be any conventional pressure apparatus, glass or steel, in which the operations of charging the reactant materials, heating, cooling, stirring, introduction of hydrogen gas, isolation and purification the final products can be conducted substantially in the absence of air and moisture. Such apparatus and procedure for carrying out the invention process will be obvious to one skilled in the art from this disclosure. The catalysts of the present invention are effective at milder conditiqns e.g. 250C than is known for other heterogeneous catalysts such as copper chromium oxides. This process is useful in reducing esters, which are produced in the oxo reaction, to the corresponding alcohols. This process is useful to reduce methyl acetate formed from methanol and carbon monoxide . This process is useful for the production of 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol from trifluoroethyl trifluoroacetate and hydrogen. The following examples are illustrative of the best mode of carrying out the invention as contemplated by us and should not be construed as being limitations on the scope and spirit of the instant invention. Example 1 Preparation of 5 Ruthenium on Carbon 0.4 g of ruthenium trichloride hydrate obtained from Matthey Bishop Company was dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water. To this 3g of DARCO ActivatedCarbon Grade G 60 special from ICI Americas, SpecialtyChemical Division, Wilmington, Delaware, DARCO being their registered trademark , was added and stirred in at room temperature for 20 hours. The water was removed in vacuum using a rotary evaporator and the solids heated in a flow reactor under hydrogen at 2000C for 2 hours, 3000C for 20 hours and 4250C for 1 2 hour. The solids were then stored in an argon dry box. Example 2 Preparation of Potassium Ruthenium on Carbon Potassium ruthenium on carbon was prepared as follows. A 90 mL Fisher and Porter pressure tube was loaded under argon with 200 mg of potassium metal.The tube was attached to a dynamic vacuum and heated in such a way that the potassium was dispersed over the inside surface of the lower 2.5 cm of the tube.Commercial 5 Ru on carbon obtained from Strem or fromEngelhard was dried by heating first at 2500C 2 hours and then for 16 hours at 4000C in a current of hydrogen.This Ru C 1.0 g was added to the pressure tube, covering most of the sublimed K metal The mixture was then heated in an electric oven under a dynamic vacuum at 4000C for 1 2 hour, cooled to R.T., shaken well and the heating repeated. The catalyst is very air sensitive and was handled under an atmosphere of pure argon. Hydrolysis of 100 mg of this K Ru C gave KOH by subsequent titration with Etc1, the catalyst was found to contain 100.9 mg K g of catalyst. Example 3 iC1oH8 Preparation of Ru C K And Similar ti , Na and Cs doped Catalysts A metal halide such as RuC13.xH20 or RhCl3.3H2O was dispersed on carbon in aqueous solution.The water was removed in vacuo by heating. The rhodium or ruthenium chloride was then reduced to the corresponding metal by heating up to 4000C under a hydrogen purge. Potassium naphthalene was prepared by stirring together equimolar amounts of naphthalene and potassium metal in tetrahydrofuran THF for 16 hours at room temperature followed by evaporation of the THF in vacuo.Lithium and cesium naphthalenes were prepared in a corresponding manner by substituting the appropriate metal for potassium metal. Sodium naphthalene was prepared without evaporation, but was used as a solution.This supported rhodium or ruthenium catalyst was then treated with the potassium naphthalene in THF solution. Alternatively, the dried, supported metal halide, nitrate, etc., can be treated with three equivalents more than the usual amount potassium naphthalene and thus reduced to the metallic form in situ with potassium naphthalene instead of hydrogen and heat. An H shaped tube with horizontal portion containing a filter frit was charged with 1 g of 5 Ru C from Engelhard, previously dried under H2 for 16 hours at 2000C, 7 hours at 3250C and 1 2 hour at 4100C and 1 g of solid potassium naphthalene 20 weight percent potassium , each loaded under argon into one leg of theH tube. Tetrahydrofuran 25 mL was added to the H tube and allowed to stir at room temperature for one hour.The reaction mixture was filtered, the Ru C K C10H8 washed with two 10 mL portions of tetrahydrofuran and dried in vacuo. An elemental analysis gave 11.85 w w potassium. Corresponding lithium, sodium and ces ium doped catalysts were prepared in a similar manner using the appropriate alkali metal naphthalene, using the sodium naphthalene solution as such. Example 4 Preparation of Rh C Using Potassium Benzophenone One side of an H shaped tube containing a filter disk was charged with 0.5 g of x Ph2CO prepared by the reaction of equal molar amounts of potassium and benzophenone at 250C for 16 hours in T F solution followed by removal of the THF in vacuo , 0.5 g of 5 Rh C and 30 mL of THF. The reaction mixture was stirred at 250C for 16 hours and filtered.The solids were then washed exhaustively with THF and dried in vacuo giving 0.6 g of Rh C K Ph2CO Example 5 Preparation of Lithium Doped Rhodium on Carbon Using Liquid NH3 A sample of 5 Rh C was treated with H2 gas in a similar manner as described in Example i1. The solid 0.93 g was loaded in one leg of a H shaped apparatus the other leg was charged wih 50 mg of lithium powder.All manipulations were done in an argon atmosphere. The apparatus was then transferred to a vacuum line and pure, dry ammonia 5 mL was condensed into the lithium containing portion of the apparatus. The Li NH3 slurry was stirred at 650C until all the metal had dissolved to yield a deep blue solution. The solution was then poured immediately onto the Rh C, where it was almost immediately decolorized by absorptiqn and reaction with the solid. After stirring at 650C for 10 minutes, the solution was filtered and the residue washed with 2 x 5 mL portions of liquid NH3. Ammonia in the filtrate was pumped off and the dark residue was dried by heating slowly in a dynamic vacuum first at 900C 3 1 2 hours then at 1600C 3 1 2 hours until no traces of NH3 evolution were noted.Analyses Li catalyst 3.98 w w Li Rh C 0.0 w w Example 6 Preparation of Sodium Doped Rhodium on Carbon Using Liquid NH3 The same technique was used as described inExample 1 except that sodium metal 95 mg and 1.0 g ofRh C were used.
