# Composition for treating particulate hydrocarbon fuel, and fuel treated therewith.

## Abstract
A composition for treating particulate hydrocarbon fuel, e.g. coal or lignite, comprises a 50 to 75 volume percent aromatic hydrocarbon oil hav ing a K factor of not more than 10.5 and b 50 to 25 volume percent asphalt said composition having an initial boiling point above 260 C 500 F , a viscosity of at least 7.00 10 ⁴ m² s 700 cSt at 37.8 C 100 F , and a flash point of at least 110 C 230 F . The composition substantially reduces dusting losses, improves cold weather handling properties and reduces lia bility to spontaneous ignition.
