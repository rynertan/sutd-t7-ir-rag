# Polymeric pyridinium ylide and products from same.

## Abstract
Polymers containing pyridinium ylide moieties are subjected to actinic irradiation to convert the pyridinium ylide moieties to water insoluble or hydrophobic N acyl diazepine polymers. The polymeric pyridinium ylides can be used for the waterproofing or hydrophobization of surfaces and for the production of printing plates, photoresists printed circuit boards and the like.
