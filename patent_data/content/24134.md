# Process for the production of polyether carbamates useful as deposit control additives for hydrocarbon fuels.

## Abstract
A process for the production of polyether monocarba mates, useful in hydrocarbon fuels as deposit control addi tives, from polyether chloroformates and polyalkylene polyamines which provides for the efficient separation of the reaction product mixture into a hydrocarbon phase contain ing the monocarbamate product and an aqueous phase con taining undesirable polyamine hydrochloride by product util izes an excess of the polyalkylene polyamine reactant contain ing a limited amount of water. The process is particularly advantageous for the continuous production of monocarba mate.
