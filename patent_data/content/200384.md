# A SUSPENSION SYSTEM FOR A MOTOR VEHICLE

## Abstract
A suspension system for a motor vehicle comprising a spring 1 connecting a sprung mass 3 to an unsprung mass 4 , a semi active damper 2B for damping relative motion between the sprung mass 3 and the unsprung mass 4 , and a harmonic vibration absorber, eg. an auxilliary mass 8 with associated spring 9 and damper 10 , connected to the unsprung mass 3 to suppress transmission of harmonic vibrations thereof, eg wheel hop , to the sprung mass 3 whereby the electronic control 7 of the semi active damper 2B need only respond to transducers 6 monitoring behaviour of the sprung mass 3 .
