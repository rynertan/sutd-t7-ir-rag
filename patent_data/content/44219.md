# Methods of immuno analysis using monoclonal antibodies.

## Abstract
An antigen antibody precipitate is obtained, using monoclonal antibodies, the monoclonal antibodies samples I or Ii or III or IV being selected so as to be specific to two distinct antigenic binding sites L or C 2 or C3 on a protein IgG in a sample under test. The proportions of sub populations of immunoglobulins IgG kappa, IgG lambda in a sample is determined by reacting the sample with a combination of antibodies II and IV both of which are specific to the heavy chains H of both sub populations IgG kappa, IgG lambda and reacting the sample with an antibody combination I and II specific to said heavy chain H and to an antigenic determinant expressed by only one IgG kappa of the sub populations.
