# Vaginal diaphragm.

## Abstract
A vaginal diaphragm has a peripheral structure 3 of oval or circular outline which is straddled by an elasto meric cap 2 . In addition, the peripheral structure 3 may be of circular or of oval or elliptical cross section in direction normal to the major axis of the oval outline, thus providing a relatively flat outer circumferential surface which engages the wall of the vaginal cavity over a com paratively large area and, hence, with low specific surface pressure. The elastomeric cap 2 is joined to the peri pheral structure 3 at the level of the mid plane M M of the diaphragm. The size of the diaphragm can be in creased or decreased by bending one or more shape retain ing sections 8 housed in a closed coil spring 4 so that a single diaphragm can be readily accomadated to a num ber of different size requirements.

## Description
Vaginal diaphragm consisting of a dome made of elastomeric material which is joined to a peripherical closed coil spring housing a bendable shape retaining armour.The invention relates to an improved vaginal diaphragm con sisting of a dome made of elastomeric material which is joined to a peripherical closed coil spring housing a bendable shape retaining armour.Vaginal diaphragm are known in which the periphery is circu lar, the cross section of the peripherical structure, formed by the peripherical coil spring and by the peripherical edge of the dome, is joined to said peripherical structure tangent with said circular cross section. In some known diaphragms the peripherical coil spring that in the following will be referred to as spring only houses a bendable shape retaining armour consisting of metal arched sections which are connected each other by small coil springs so that, to intro duce the diaphragm into the vaginal cavity, the diaphragm may be bent about said small coil springs by lightly pressing two opposite points of the peripherical structure by two fingers.In other known diaphragms no armour is housed in the spring.It is known that the scope of said armour is to assure the engagement of the peripherical structure to the inner wall of the vaginal cavity.A diaphragm of this type is described in Population Reports of Department of Medical and Public Affairs, The GeorgeWashington University Medical Center, 2001 S. Street, N.W.Washington D.C. 20009.Such known diaphragms do not allow to vary the perimeter which requires to provide for a fairly large variety of diaphragms of different diameters. The circular shape of the diaphragms, the spring of which houses the arched sections, does not fit the nearly oval cross section of the vaginal cavity and this causes non uniform and troubling pressures of the diaphragm on the inner wall of said cavity. On the other hand, with the diaphragms which do not house an armour, the engagement with said inner wall is not enough to assure a safe contraceptive barrier. Moreover, such diaphragms are to be introduced in said cavity with the dome convexity outwardly directed and, consequently, a fingernail could nick or pierce the dome, when extracting the diaphragm, since no good grip point is available.Finally, the circular dome, once introduced in said cavity, becomes approximately oval and takes folds which disturb the uniform distribution of the spermicid substance which is generally used with the diaphragm.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to overcome the prior art disadvantages.A more particular object of the invention is to provide a va final diaphragm of safer and easier use as well as a diaphragms which allows to manufacture a reduced number of different sizes to meet the requirements of any user.The invented diaphragm comprises a spring, alternatively of circular or oval cross section, which houses a bendable shaperetaining armour capable of being deformed easily by the fin gers so as to adjust the plan shape and dimensions of the diaphragm the dome is joined to the peripherical structure at the level of the mid plane of the diaphragm the plan periphery is, alternatively, circular or oval according to the kind of armour housed in the spring.The main advantages of the invented diaphragm are set forth herebelow.An embodiment of the diaphragm provides for the bendable shaperetaining armour within the spring consisting of two arched sections of circular cross section which sections have pointed ends connected by means of two small coil springs the plan of such a diaphragm is oval shaped and the diaphragm is capa ble of being extended or shortened with respect to the nominal length of the selected diaphragm which means to adjust the diaphragm to the specific required size. Such an adjust ment is made by conveniently bending outwardly or inwardly the central length of the arched sections or the lengths close to the ends thereof. Moreover, the oval shape of the diaphragm well fits the vaginal cavity and therefore causes fairly uniform pressures on the inner wall of said cavity.Another embodiment of the diaphragm provides for bendable sha pe retaining armour within the spring consisting of a circular closed section of flat cross section and of a spring of oval cross section the major axis of which is perpendicular to the mid plane of the diaphragm. Then, it will be appreciated that the whole peripherical structure of such diaphragm is of oval cross section and that the supporting surface of said structure on said inner wall is well larger than the supporting surface of the circular cross section. Moreover, the circular closed section housed in the spring is capable of being deformed by the fingers in order to adjust the dimensions of the peripherical structure.A better engagement of the dome with the cervix is allowed by the dome being joined to the peripherical structure at the level of the mid plane of the diaphragm since the dome diameter is reduced this makes the diaphragm safer and also reduces the dome folds which could badly affect the uniform distribution of the spermicide substance. Further, when using such diaphragm it is of no importance to keep outwardly a fa ce or the other due to the plan symmetry of the dome about the mid plane of the diaphragm. Still more finally, the relief of the peripherical structure from the dome is a good grip point for a finger which extracts the diaphragm from said cavity.The novel features which are considered as characteristics of the invention are set forth in the appended claims. The construction of the invention as well as additional objects and advantages thereof will however be best understood from the following description of the specific embodiments in connection with the accompanying drawings. FIG.1 is a top plan,view of a diaphragm embodying the invention FIG. 2 is a section taken on line Il Il of FIG.1 FIG. 2a is a simplified section similar to the one in FIG. 2, but illustrating a prior art device for compa rison FIG. 3 is a top plan view similar to the one in FIG. 1, but with portions broken away to facilitate illustration of the interior construction of the device FIG. 4 is a perspective view of the device in preceeding FIGURES, showing it bent in preparation for its intro duction into the vaginal cavity FIG. 5 is a plan view of the device, with the cap omitted and the peripherical spring shown in broken lines, illu strating various adjustment possibilities FIG. 6 is a plan view of another embodiment of the inven tion FIG. 7 is a section taken on line Vil Vil of FIG. 6 FIG. 8 is a view similar to FIG. 3 but of the embodiment in FIG. 6 and FIG. 9 is a perspective view of the diaphragm in FIG. 6, shown bent in preparation for installation.The diaphragm 1 of FIG. 1 consists of the dome 2 made of rub ber and of the peripherical structure 3 formed by a spring 4 of circular cross section and by the edge 20 of the dome 2 which is wound, not cast, and conveniently fixed around the spring 4, so forming a sleeve surrounding the spring 4.Within the spring 4 two bendable shape retaining steel arched sections 8, 9 of circular cross section are housed, symmetric about axis A A of FIG. 1, each arched section being provided with pointed ends 10, 11 and 12, 13 which conveniently penetrate two small coil springs 14. The continuity between the sections 8, 9 and the small springs 14 does not prevent the diaphragm from being bent, as shown in FIG. 4, in the area of the small springs 14, in the sections 15, 16.As illustrated in FIG. 5, the longitudinal dimension of the diaphragm 1 may be varied by some extent. If the central lengths of the arched sections 8, 9 or the lengths close to the ends thereof are conveniently bent outwardly in the direction of arrow F FIG. 5 , the diaphragm extends. On the contrary, if the ends of said lengths are conveniently pressed inwardly in the direction of arrow F , the diaphragm shortens.The dome 2 is joined via portion 2a to the peripherical struc ture 3 at the level of the mid plane referred to as M M inFIG. 2, rather than extending tangentially thereto as in prior art see elements 2 and 3 in FIG. 2a .It will be appreciated that the oval diaphragm provided with bendable shape retaining arched sections of circular cross section may have the spring 4 and consequently the whole peripherical structure 3 of oval cross section, as an alter native to the circular cross section.The diphragm 1 of FIG. 6 consists of the dome 2 made of soft rubber and of the peripherical structure 3 formed by a closed spring 4 of oval cross section and by the edge 20 of the dome 2 which is Wound, not cast, and conveniently fired around the spring 4 . Within the spring 4 is housed a bendable shape retaining steel circular closed section 8 of rectangular cross section such section 8 is closed peripherically and the ends thereof are overlapped by a few mil limetero, as shown in FIG. 8. If the overlap is more than a few millimeters, the overlapped ends may be surrounded by one or more rings not shown within the spring 4 . Consequently, if a pull or a compression is exerted radially on the peripherical structure 3 , then the diaphragm 1 extends or shor tens, respectively, so providing for adjustment according to the specific requirements. Finally, PIG. 9 shows the diaphragm 1 bent for being introduced in the vaginal cavity.
