# Variable area turbine and control system therefor.

## Abstract
A turbocharger 12 is provided with means 24 for varying the effective area of the turbine 14 , including actuating means 26 for actuating said means 24 to achieve an effective area as a predetermined function of engine rpm, the function comprising a first portion I at high rpms that maintains the effective area substantially at its maximum area condition as established by peak engine operating pressures, a second portion II at lower rpms which maintains the effective area substantially in the minimum area condition and a third portion III intermediate the first and second portions having a characteristic that the effective area increases as an increasing function of engine rpm established by selected engine operating parameters, means 83 for generating a feedback signal representing the actual effective area and feeding the signal back to control means 28 , and said control means 28 being responsive to the feeback signal to generate pulses applied to said actuating means 26 to correct the means 24 for varying the effective area of the turbine 914 to achieve said effective area as a predetermined function of engine rpm.
