# A method of making indolizinone dyes, novel indolizinone dyes obtained according to the process, method of producing images with oxoindolizinone dyes and radiation sensitive element to produce the images.

## Abstract
Indolizinone dyes and compositions are obtained by reacting cyclopropenones with di or tri halogenated com pounds in the presence of pyridine. A layer containing the cyclopropenone and halogenated compound can be image wise exposed to radiation which decomposes the cyclo propenone and the residual cyclopropenone reacted with the halogenated compound and pyridine to yield a positive dye image.
