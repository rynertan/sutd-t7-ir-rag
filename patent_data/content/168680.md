# Solid phase acylation of aminosulfonic acids.

## Abstract
Acylation of aliphatic, aromatic or heteroaromatic ami nosulfonic acids to produce improved neutralized acyl aminosulfonic acids and optional preceding neutralizing of the aminosulfonic acid if in the acidic form, are carried out in the solid phase under intensive agitation. The yield is virtually quantitative.
