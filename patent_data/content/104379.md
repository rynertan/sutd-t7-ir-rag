# Apparatus for remotely indicating angular position.

## Abstract
A sensor 16 is affixed to a piece of rotatable equipment 10 . The sensor has a rolling member 26 freely moveable within a cage member 18 . In operation, the rolling member 26 contacts electrically conductive surfaces 28, 30 dis posed about the interior of the cage member. By determining which particular pair of surfaces are currently in contact with the rolling member, the orientation of the cage member with respect to the horizontal is known. The preferred embodi ment utilizes a resistor network 34 and an electrical measuring device 48 for making this determination.
