# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IDENTIFYING MATERIAL

## Abstract
Automatic material identification is achieved using in frared thermometry. A focused beam 31 of high flux energy is passed through a dichroic beam splitter 5 to remove visible light with the remaining infrared energy directed to the surface 7 of the material to be identified. An infrared thermometer sensor 15 is positioned to sense the magni tude of the energy reflected from the material surface 7 with the magnitude of the reflected energy being indicative of the type of material reflecting such energy. Control apparatus 17 is employed to provide control signals as a function of the type of material identified such that automatic process operations may be effected in accordance therewith.
