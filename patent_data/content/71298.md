## Description
SHARPENING UNIT PRINCIPALLY FOR FOODSTUFF SLICING MACHINES . The present invention relates to a sharpening unit which can be applied principally to slicing machines operating with a rotating circular cutter knife and used for slicing foodstuff products. Various kinds of said slicing machines are known those driven manually or electrically, those with vertical or inclined cutter knife and, in the versions used in the trade they are always provided with a sharpening unit for sharpening the cutter knife blade if this is not sharp enough to slice the foodstuff product. Said sharpening unit is incorporated in the slicing machine or separated from it in this latter case, however, it is separated in such a way as to be able to be connected to one of the component parts of the slicing machine. The conventional, incorporated types of sharpening unit normally comprise a pivot fixed to the slicing machine, on which pivot is articulated a support structure for two wheels pivoted on the slicing machine they also comprise a lever element adapted to actuate the wheels according to a pre established sequence to cause them to come to bear against the blade of the circular cutting knife. In some models the support structure for the wheels is closed on its upper side by a blade protection cover. One of the wheels, for sharpening, is used to remove material from the worn blade, while the other, flash cleaning wheel is used to remove the flash formed on the blade by the former grinding or sharpening wheel. The flash cleaning wheel is in some cases replaced by a wheel made of hardened material. The conventional sharpening units of separate type differ from those just described in that the support structure, and thus all that is connected to it grinding and flash removal wheels, lever element, etc. , has to be mounted on the slicing machine proximally to the cutter knife blade before sharpening can be commenced, and has to be removed from the slicing machine when sharpening is concluded. The said sharpening units at present used with slicing machines, however, entail problems. As far as the incorporated types are concerned, before they can be brought into operating position, and as is known, they have to be lifted, rotated through an angle ranging from 450 to 1800 depending on the model and, finally, have to be pressed downwards. As far as the separate types are concerned, they have, as has been stated, to be mounted on the slicing machine, and this often means removing a number of component parts of said machine for the mounting to be possible. All such operations, both with the incorporated and separated types of sharpening unit, are troublesome for the user of the slicing machine, above all because they are complex operations. With the incorporated type of sharpening unit, moreover, the difficulty of reaching the corners, and the small space between the component parts, allow small scope for cleaning the sharpening unit, and its cleanliness and appearance are thus neglected. The wheels, furthermore, become impregnated with fatty substances or other foodstuff residues, which require to be removed for reasons of hygiene and to restore efficiency to the wheels themselves. For this reason said wheels have periodically to be dismantled from the support structure and immersed in a special solvent liquid. Dismantling the said wheels is, however, a troublesome operation calling for special spanners and, with some models of the said incorporated sharpening units, the units themselves have to be dismantled from the slicing machine and immersed wholesale in the solvent liquid for their grinding and flash cleaning wheels to be cleaned. Finally, with the separate type of sharpening unit, its mounting on the slicing machine and state of readiness for use require the shifting of the faceplate and other parts of the slicing machine which normally protect the cutter blade from accidental contacts caused by the operator. This is very dangerous, and in certain countries with severe safety regulations it is prohibi ted to market slicing machines featuring such type of sharpening unit. The object of the present invention is to obviate the said problems caused by the existing sharpening units. This object is attained by the embodiment of a sharpening unit for slicing machines which operate with a rotating circular cutter knife, characterized by the fact that it comprises a shielding and protective element for the blade of the cutter knife rotatably restrained in a movable manner to a fixed structure of the slicing machine and proximal to said blade, and that within said shielding and protective element there are secured in a removable manner sharpening means for said blade, these means consisting of a first, sharpening tool and a second, flash cleaning tool arranged in opposed manner with respect to said blade and proximal to it. The shielding and protective element oscillates in opposition to elastic means between a position of contact of said first tool against the blade and a position of contact of said second tool against the blade.Moreover, at the time the shielding and protective element is removed from the slicing machine it pilots means for stopping the drive of the blade. For a clearer understanding of the characteristics and advantages of the present invention, there is given below a description of one exemplifying and not limitinq embodiment thereof, illustrated in the attached drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a sharpening unit according to the invention applied to a slicing machine operating with a rotating circular cutter knife, FIGURE 2 is a section of the sharpening unit ofFIGURE 1 along the line II II of FIGURE 3,FIGURE 3 is a partially sectional view of the sharpening unit of FIGURE 1 in the direction of the arrow F of FIGURE 4, FIGURE 4 is a sectional view of the sharpening unit of FIGURE 1 along the line IV IV of FIGURE 3, FIGURE 5 is a sectional view of the sharpening unit of FIGURE 1 along the line V V of FIGURE 3. In FIGURE 1 there is indicated by 10 a sharpening unit according to the invention mounted on a slicing machine 11 fitted with a rotating circular cutterknife 12. The unit 10 comprises a boxlike shield 13 rotatably and removably restrained to a fixed structure 14 of the slicing machine 11 in a position such as to overhang the cutter knife 12 and to allow the blade 15 of the cutter knife 12 to move within it. For this movement to be possible, the boxlike shield 13 has within and solid with it a bushing 16 which fits over a small vertical column 17 mounted rotatably on the fixed structure 14. The mounting of this column is effected by engaging a cylindrical lower end portion 32 of the column 17 with a corresponding seating 33 of the fixed structure 14 FIGURE 3 . The bushing 16 is adapted to be restrained in rotation to the column 17 by a dowel 26 which crosses the bushing 16 transversally and fits into a longitudinal groove 27 of the column 17 which runs to the upper end of said column 17 FIGURE 2 . The bushing 16 can in this way slide longitudinally on the column 17 to the point of coming off it, but cannot rotate with respect to it. Inside the boxlike shield 13 there is removably mounted a block 18 which supports a grinding wheel 19 in a freely rotatable manner. Two vertical pegs 20 and 21 solid with the wall 30 of the head of the boxlike shield 13 are provided for the mounting of the block 18. These pegs insert themselves respectively into a corresponding through hole 22 and a corresponding dead hole 23, both formed in the block 18. The free end of the peg 20 projects from the lower side of the block 18 when this has been mounted FIGURE 4 and carries a groove on its circumference to receive the claws of a small spring 24 secured to the block 18 at 25 and adapted to retain the block 18 against the boxlike shield 13 FIGURE 2 . The grinding wheel 19 is proximal to the blade 15 and is adapted to sharpen it. Within the boxlike shield 13 there is also mounted in a removable manner a small circular plate 28 made of hardened steel, disposed proximally to the blade 15 from the side opposed to the grinding wheel 19 and down stream of it FIGURE 4 . The small plate 28 has a central hole to allow it to be placed over a T pin 29 solid with a lateral wall 31 of the boxlike shield 13 and then restrained, with a downward movement, between the head of the pin 29 and the wall 31 FIGURE 5 . Finally, inside the boxlike shield 13 there is provided a projection 34 of a lateral wall 35 of the box like shield. To this projection is screwed a pin 36, transversal to the blade 15, which pin slides in a cor responding through seating 37 of a small block 38 against a spring 39 wound about the pin 36. At one of its ends, the spring 39 screws into the seating 37, while the other end is fixed to the projection 34. In the block 38 there is also formed a seating 48 for a vertical pin 40 locked to the fixed structure 14. This is clearly shown in FIGURE 5. For reasons to be explained hereinafter, the small column 17 has within it a longitudinal cavity 41 which houses in slidable manner a small rod 42, which extends to the interior of the fixed structure 14 through a hole 47 in the seating 33. The small rode 42 is thrust downwards, when the bushing 16 is fitted over the small column 17, by a longitudinal pin 43 screwed into the bushing 16. The pin 43 presses on the upper end of the small rod 42 which with its lower end flexes downwards a small elastic lamina 44 restrained to a microswitch 46 fitted inside the fixed structure 14. The small lamina 44, in turn, in its flexing movement, presses a push button 45 of the microswitch 46. This is clearly shown in FIGURE 3. The microswitch 46 forms part of an electrical safety circuit on the slicing machine when the pushbutton 45 is depressed, the supply circuit of the drive group for the cutter knife 12 is energized, and the said cutter knife can be set in operation through a central switch controlled by the operator, when the pushbutton 45 is released, the supply circuit is deenergized and the drive group cannot in any way be started up. For the sake of simplicity, the safety circuit, the supply circuit, the drive unit and the central switch, which can be variously embodied by any person skilled in the art, are not illustrated. To mount the boxlike shield 13 on the fixed structure 14 it is sufficient to slip the bushing 16 onto the small column 17, sliding the dowel 26 in the prooving 27 and to fit the block 38 onto the pin 40. When mounted in this way, the boxlike shield 13 can oscillate around the seating 33 against the spring 39. To sharpen the blade 15, the operator has to actuate the cutter knife 12 and then bring pressure to bear in the direction of the arrow A shown in FIGURES 1 and 5 in this way the grinding wheel 19 touches the blade 15 and can perform its known abrasive action on the blade. When sharpening is complete, to remove the flash that has formed from the blade 15, the operator has then to release the boxlike shield 13, which returns to the rest position of FIGURE 4, through the action of the spring 39 the operator has then again to bring pressure to bear on the boxlike shield 13 in the direction opposed to the aforesaid direction and that is to say in the direction of the arrow B shown by a dashed and dotted line inFIGURE 1, and also shown in FIGURE 5 . This causes the small plate 28 to touch the blade 15 and remove the flash in known manner. Once flash removal has been completed, when the boxlike shield 13 is again released, it returns, once more by effect of the action of the spring 39, to the rest position of FIGURE 4, and the cutterknife is ready to be used for slicing. The sharpening unit 10 described above offers various advantages. Firstly, it can be actuated by two very simple press operations by the operator, as seen heretofore. Secondly, it is easy to remove to allow cleaning operations, it being necessary only to raise the boxlike shield 13. Its parts have the same ready ease of dismantling to free the block 18 from the boxlike shield 13 it in fact suffices to free the pin 20 from the grip of the spring 24. In this way, by means of operations which are all rapid, the grinding wheel 19 carried by the block 18 can be cleaned or substituted. Similarly, to clean or substitute the small plate 28, it is only necessary to raise it and remove it from the pin 29. Finally, the said sharpening unit 10 satisfies the severest safety regulations. For, when it is removed it covers the portion of the blade 15 comprised between the blade cover, not shown in the FIGURE, and the faceplate 49, thus preventing the blade 15 from being touched accidentally. When the boxlike shield 13 is removed, the small rod 42 is freed by the pressure exerted by the pin 43 and, as a consequence, the small lamina 44 rises and releases the pushbutton 45, and, as described previously, prevents the cutter knife 12 from being actuated. Clearly, the present exemplifying embodiment does not place restrictions on possible variants and or additions. In particular, the shape of the boxlike shield 13 and its type of mounting on the slicing machine 11 can be of numberless kinds as dictated by the imagination of the person skilled in the art. The same applies in respect of the other parts of the sharpening unit 10.
