# PROCESS FOR PREPARING TEA PRODUCTS

## Abstract
The present invention comprises a process for the prep aration of shelf stable tea concentrates and tea powders wherein a tea extract is prepared, acidified, and heated off flavor and malodorous compounds are removed from the extract the extract is cooled and precipitates are removed from it and flavoring and sweetener are blended with the clarified extract. The acidification and heating steps accel erate acid catalyzed degradation reactions that normally oc cur causing the development of off flavor sulfurous compounds and precipitates. By forcing these components to react, removing the resultant volatile compounds, and sep arating the precipitates formed, the development of these off flavors, off aromas, and precipitates in the resultant tea product is prevented. The tea product is shelf stable and use of preservatives such as antioxidants or antimicrobial agents is not needed.
