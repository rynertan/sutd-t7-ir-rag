# Colour television receiver.

## Abstract
An apparatus for reducing the effect of co channel inter ference on horizontal synchronization is provided in the televi sion receiver. The receiver has a comb filter 33 for separating luminance and chrominance signals from a composite video signal and a synchronizing pulse separator 43 , coupled to the comb filter output, for deriving synchronizing pulses from the comb filter luminance signal. The co channel interference beat frequency signals are reduced in amplitude by the comb filter and hence do not disrupt the operation of the synchronizing pulse separator. The separator 43 coupled to the comb filter 33 may be for horizontal synchronizing pulses only, a sepa rate vertical synchronizing pulse separator being coupled to the output of the I.F. stage.
