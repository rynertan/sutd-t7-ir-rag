# Battery coil construction and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell utilizes a coil assembly formed by spirally winding negative and positive plates together with at least one separator therebetween. Each of the posi tive and negative plates is constituted by a main portion con taining battery active material and an edge portion free of the active material. In the coil assembly, the edge portions 12a of the respective plates protrude outwardly beyond the opposite edges of the separator and positioned on respective sides of the coil assembly. Positive and negative current col lectors 21 are made of a holeless nickel plated steel sheet 21a and welded to the edge portions 12a of the respective plates by means of a plurality of welds w .
