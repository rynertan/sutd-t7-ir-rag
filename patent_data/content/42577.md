# Radiant energy conversion.

## Abstract
A radiant energy conversion system capable of receiving input energy 20 in thermal or radiant form at a variable rate, and releasing energy in thermal, radiant or electrical form independent of rate has a thermal energy storage of a material 23 that has three criteria, a melting temperature of not less than 960 C and preferably about 1027 C, a thermal conductivity greater than 0.4184 watts per metre Kelvin 0.1 calories per square centimetre per centimetre per degree per second and a latent heat of fusion of more than 4.184 kilojoules 1 kilocalorie per mole. The converter can absorb energy of multiple types, store it and then release it in a form compatible with the prospective use. Sunlight of daylight duration and varying intensity can be converted to steady 24 hour a day electrical output 30 .
