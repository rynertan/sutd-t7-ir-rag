# Moulding glass parisons.

## Abstract
Apparatus for spraying lubricant into closed moulds 19 of a glass forming machine has the spray outlets 88 on a carrier structure 30 34, 90 96 which is pivoted on the funnel arm shaft 10 of the machine. For lubrication a pneumatic cylinder 60, 108 couples it to its support 40 , fast with the funnel arm shaft so that the carrier and spray outlets are moved over the moulds. During a moulding cycle the carrier is held back operative by a spring 50 so the funnels 14 can be used normally.
