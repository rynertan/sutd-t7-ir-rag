## Description
METHOD OF DETERMINING CORROSION RESISTANCE This invention relates to a method of determining corrosion resistance of zirconium and zirconium base alloys aid, more particularly, with the corrosion testing of weldments thereof. Zirconium alloys are commonly used in commercial pressurized water and boiling water nuclear reactors for structural elements such as fuel rod channels and grids, and as heat transfer elements such as tubular fuel cladding. One of the most common methods of joining one zirconium alloy member to another to form the aforementioned elements is by welding. Zirconium and its alloys are well known to be highly reactive materials at high temperatures that is, they readily, and rapidly, combine with oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. It is known that the contamination of zirconium alloys with these elements can adversely affect the aqueous corrosion resistance and or mechanical properties of the alloy. It is therefore common practice in the welding of zirconium alloy nuclear components to perform all welding in an inert atmosphere such as in a vacuum, or in a helium or argon atmosphere. For example, the girth welds joining Zircaloy 4 end plugs to the ends of Zircaloy 4 fuel cladding are typically formed by Tungsten InertGas TIG welding in a helium filled chamber.To assure that air is not leaking into the welding chamber and contaminating the weldment, weldment samples are period ically subjected to a three day 3600C 6800F water corrosion test ASTM Test No. G2 . While this test is very successful in detecting weldment samples having harmful impurity levels, especially nitrogen, it is time consuming. It takes three, to as long as seven days, to obtain test results. Due to this long turnaround time, the three day water test is of little value as a process control test. Also, the storage space required for welded product awaiting acceptable test results is costly and increases inventory control problems.It is therefore desirable to develop a test which is as capable as the three day water test in detecting weldments with deleterious impurity levels, but which is significantly more rapid. Accordingly, the present invention resides in a method of determining corrosion resistance characterized by immersing a zirconium or zirconium alloy weldment including weld and heat affected zones into a fused salt bath maintained at a predetermined elevated temperature, controlling the temperature of said fused salt bath and the duration of said immersion to produce an essentially black oxide film in corrosion resistant weld and heat affected zones while producing a scaling oxide scale in non corrosion resistant weld and heat affected zones, removing said weldment from said salt bath, and evaluating the oxide produced by said immersion on said weld and heat affected zones for the presence of said scaling oxide. This method takes less than one hour while maintaining an accuracy commensurate with the commercial 3600C water test method now in use. Desirably, a zirconium or zirconium alloy weldment, which includes the weld and heat affected zones HAZ , is immersing into a fused salt bath maintained at a temperature above 4000C. Preferably, the fused salt bath is composed of a mixture of NaN03, KN03, and KI. Preferably, the salt bath temperature and test duration are controlled to produce an adherent oxide weight gain in corrosion resistant Zircaloy 4 of from 6 to 16 mg dm2. Preferably, the temperature of the bath is maintained at from 4000C 7500F to 5000C 9320F with a bath temperature of from 4600C 8600F to 482 OC 9000F being more preferred. .The duration of immersion is preferably from 2.5 to 16 minutes with a duration of from 5 to 10 minutes being most preferred. Best results have been achieved when using a fused salt bath composed of about 48.6 w o NaN03 about 41.0 w o KNO3 about 10.4 w o KI held at a temperature of from 460at 86O0F to 4820C 9000F with a Zircaloy 4 weldment immersion time of from 2.5 to 16 minutes, and more preferably, from 5 to 10 minutes. It is, however, our belief that the above parameters can be varied in accordance with the following guidelines while still achieving excellent results. The controlling of the combination of time of immersion and temperature is believed to be critical. The time of immersion and the temperature of the bath should be controlled to produce an essentially black, adherent oxide film in corrosion resistant weldments while producing a scaling oxide corrosion product in contaminated, noncorrosion resistant weldments. The range of values of this time temperature combination will vary in accordance with the particular salt bath used, and the oxidation kinetics of the particular metal or alloy e.g., zirconium, Zircaloy 2, Zircaloy 4, zirconium 2.5 w o niobium . For example, in Zircaloy 4 it is known that the conventional three day water test produces an oxide weight gain in high quality Zircaloy 4 weldment samples of from 6 to 16 milli 2 grams square decimeter mg dm .It was therefore one of our goals when testing Zircaloy 4 weldments in accordance with our invention to select time temperature combinations which will also produce weight gains of from 6 16 mg dm2 in .on contaminated Zircaloy 4 weldments. The Figure shows that for immersion in a 48.6 w o NaN03 41.0 w o KN03 10.4 w o KI fused salt bath held at 460 to 4820C, the time necessary to produce the aforementioned weight gain is from 6 to 16 minutes. However, our tests have shown that immersion times as short as 2.5 minutes can still distinguish contaminated Zircaloy 4 weidments. While immersion times as short as 0.5 minute may still distinguish unacceptable from acceptable product, we prefer, in order to optimize the reproducibility of the test results, that the immersion time be held to from 2.5 to 16 minutes and, more preferably, from 5 to 10 minutes.At times longer than about 10 minutes spurious oxide scaling, unrelated to contamination, may occur with increasing frequency and interfere with the accurate evaluation of the test results. Salt bath temperatures as low as 4000C and as high as about 5000C are also contemplated. The immersion time, however, is required to reproducibly distinguish contaminated material expected to vary with the bath temperature. For example, for bath temperatures around 400at, the immersion time to produce a weight gain of 6 to 16 mg dm2 will be significantly longer than the about 5 to 16 minutes required at 460 to 4820C, while the immersion time to produce the same weight gain at about 5000C will be reduced. While the composition of the salt bath is important to achieving the results described, it is not believed to be critical. It is therefore contemplated that other ratios of NaN03 to KN03 to KI may be used, and that other substantially equivalent salt mixtures may also be substituted. While reagent grade NaN03, KNO3i and KI has been utilized in the following Examples, it is believed that commercial grades of these salts will produce similar results. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples Example I Seventy five 75 Zircaloy 4 test coupons were submitted for salt bath corrosion testing on eight different days over a three week period. The fused salt bath utilized was a mixture of reagent grade salts producing the following mixture 48.6 w o NaNO3 41.0 w o KN03 10.4 w o KIThe bath temperature was set at 4600C with an actual range of 4600 to 482 OC. Prior to immersion, all coupons were cleaned with isopropanol. The duration of immersion used was varied and included the following durations in minutes 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60.Upon removal from the salt bath, the coupons were quenched in water and any adhering salt was rinsed off. The oxide weight gain of each coupon was then measured. The Figure shows the correlation between the oxide film weight gain ofZircaloy 4 test coupons and the duration of immersion in the fused salt bath. The results, shown graphically in the figure, indicate a straight line correlation passing through the origin with a slope of about 1. Least squares analysis of the data yield weight gain mg dm2 time min. x 0.982 0.183 with R2 0.984 .Test coupons submitted for three day water autoclave tests showed weight gains of 6.1 16.1 mg dm2. The optimum salt bath test duration to match the weight gains observed in the conventional three day water test is about 6 to about 16 minutes. Example II In order to demonstrate the ability to predict accurately three day water corrosion test results, Zircaloy 4 end plugs having a Zircaloy 4 weldment were cut from rods that had been rejected due to slight atmosphere contamination as detected in the three day water corrosion test. Fifty 50 end plugs were given the three day water test in five separate autoclave runs. Results from these tests see Table I showed a 38 failure rate i.e., scaling oxide in the weld and or heat affected zones .

The overall failure rate was 40 30 75 . See Tables II and III.

At test durations longer than 7.5 minutes, a spurious scale formation was seen on all plugs.This scale formation was attributed to base metal corrosion and not considered as a failure i.e., it was not associated with the weld metal or heat affected zones . Example III To further examine the scale formation, several plugs were tested in the salt bath using the technique used in Examples I and II with one exception. Samples were removed every 30 seconds for visual examination only no quenching . Failed plugs showed evidence of scale formation as early as 30 sec. into the test. In the preceding examples the fused salt bath temperature was controlled between about 460 and about 4820C, a range of about 220C. It is believed that the test may be further improved by tighter control of the temperature during immersion. A temperature range of about 60C is contemplated e.g. about 460 to about 4660C . While our invention has been described with respect to the detection of atmospheric contamination during welding, it is presently contemplated that those of ordinary skill in the art may also utilize this test to detect tungsten and or uranium contamination as well, with any modification, which may be necessary, well within their skill after reading the foregoing specification.
