# Mould for casting ceramic material.

## Abstract
The mould has a plurality of mould parts which include a lower mould part 4 adapted to rest on a support, further mould parts 1,2 which with the lower mould part define a casting cavity and which after casting can be removed to leave the cast article 13 resting on the lower mould part, and an annular seat 3 which is incorporated in the assembled mould before casting, supported by the lower mould part spaced below the casting cavity. After casting and when the further mould parts are removed, the seat can be raised to lift the article off the lower mould part. The seat may be made of lightweight plastics. Such moulds are particularly suitable for casting water closet bowls or bidets in an inverted position, especially in an installation having many such moulds, because the seats are all interchangeable.
