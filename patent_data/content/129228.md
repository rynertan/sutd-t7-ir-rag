# IMPROVED HARDENABLE FABRIC AND METHOD

## Abstract
A method of producing a fiber composite which is flexible but capable of being hardened without significant dimen sional shrinkage and fabric produced by said fiber. As alterna tive embodiments, either a cross linked and drawn mono or multi filament fiber or a partially or fully oriented yarn is wound as a single or double helix around an elastomer, while being substantially elongated and thus under tension. Once the helix is formed, the tension imposed upon the elastomer is relaxed whereby the fabric assumes its final shape and con tour. Upon the application of heat, the fabric substantially hardens without significant dimensional shrinkage.
