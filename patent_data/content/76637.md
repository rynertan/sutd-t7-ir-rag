# Optical cable.

## Abstract
In a known optical cable, optical fibers 24 are loosely laid in a number of grooves 16 formed within an elongate plastics extrusions 14 . Typically the grooves 16 follow a helical path with periodically reversing pitch, the helices centered on a central longitudinal axis of the cable. A primary reason for the helical lay is to prevent the fibers 24 from becoming stressed should a bend occur in the cable. A further benefit of loose laying of fibers 24 in a helical groove 16 of periodically reversing pitch is that any elongation of the cable core is not immediately transmitted to the fiber 24 supported by it. The fiber 24 will move from its initial loose laid position both in a direction towards the inside curve 20 of the helix and in a direction towards the base 22 of the grooves 16 . When it bears against the cable core over an appreciable length, the fiber 24 will then be subjected to tensile stress. By the invention, tolerance to core elongation is increased by arranging that the grooves 16 at any point along the core cant towards the outside curve 25 of the helix.
