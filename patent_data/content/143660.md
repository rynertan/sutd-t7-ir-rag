# RESISTORS, METHODS OF FORMING SAID RESISTORS, AND ARTICLES COMPRISING SAID RESISTORS

## Abstract
This invention concerns resistor compositions, methods of forming such resistor compositions, and articles com prising a substrate carrying such resistor compositions. The resistor compositions of the invention comprise car bon particles embedded in a matrix formed from short chain length phenolic resin, long chain length phenolic resin, epoxy and, optionally filler. The resistor compositions of the invention can be formed by mixing short chain length phenolic resin, long chain length phenolic resin, solvent, and, if present, filler with carbon particles to form a solution which is then mixed with the epoxy to form an ink. The ink is applied to a substrate to form a film thereon which is cured to evaporate solvent and to allow polymerization to occur thereby leaving the resistor compo sition on the substrate.
