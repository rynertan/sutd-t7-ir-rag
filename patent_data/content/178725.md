## Abstract
A combined separating, bursting and sorting apparatus for a continuous web of multi forms having sheet divisions fixed by perforation lines, provided with a bursting device, a path of travel, and a sorting device consisting of a plurality of receptacles 46 50 for separated and bursted sheets, said path of travel beginning at a plurality of plate shaped infeed elements 2 7 with connected, elongated, tensioned guide elements 21 26 which extend substantially linearly to a deflection at a receptacle, which infeed elements for insert ing a layer of the continuous web of multi forms are capable of being deflected or swivelled away from each other and are combined to a packet by inserting thin distance plates 14 18 in the side edge regions on both sides of the path of travel and the guide function of a guide element receding at the point of deflection is taken over by a guide plate which extends to the next deflection and follows same, and adjoins the path of travel on one side, the other side of which is formed by belt conveyor means or by conveyor wheels.
