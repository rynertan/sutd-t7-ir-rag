# IMPROVED DRILL BIT AND METHOD

## Abstract
The cutting edge of a bit of a rotary drill comprises an agglomerate of natural or synthetic diamond mounted at the free end of a shank freely rotatable in a socket in the body. Preferably the agglomerate and the free end of the shank are cold swaged together and preferably a resilient spring is interposed about the shank between the body and the free end.
