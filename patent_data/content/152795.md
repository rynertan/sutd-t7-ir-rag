# Thermal transfer printing.

## Abstract
Chemical heat amplification is provided in thermal trans fer printing, wherein some of the heat necessary for melting and transferring ink from a solid fusible layer in a ribbon to a re ceiving medium is provided by an exothermic reaction. This chemical reaction is due to an exothermic material that is lo cated in the ink layer, or in another layer of the ink bearing rib bon. The exothermic reaction reduces the amount of the input power which must be applied either electrically or with elec tromagnetic waves. Examples of suitable exothermic materials are those which will provide heat within the operative tempera ture range of the ink, and include hydrazone derivatives which are substantially colorless, and have a molecular weight in the approximate range 150 650. The group consisting of substi tuted aryl sulfonyl hydrazones, mono hydrazones of acrylic diketones, aromatic disulfonyl and diacyl hydrazones, and mono hydrazones of cyclic dicarbonyl heterocycles are us able exothermic materials.
