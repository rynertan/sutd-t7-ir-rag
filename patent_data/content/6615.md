## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING EPIHALOHYDRIN ENANTIOMERSAND INTERMEDIATESBackground of the Invention he present invention is concerned with processes for preparing epihalohydrin enantiomers and intermediates. Zpibormohydrin enantiomers have been prepared by a resolution process and an epichlorohydrin enantiomer has been prepared from 1 brcmo 3 chlorpropan 2 ol. enantiomer derived from the epibromohydrin Chemische Berichte 48, 1862 184, 1915 J. An improved method for preparing the epihalohydrin enantiomers from sulfonyloxyhaloalcohol has been discovered and an improved process for preparing an intermediate useful in the synthesis has also been discovered.Summary of the invention Process for a preparing S or Rj epihalohydrin from an S or R sulfonyloxyhaloalcohol and b preparing S glycerol l, 2 acetonide from isopropylidine D mannitOl. Description of the Preferred Embodiments An embodiment of the present invention is a process for preparing an enantiomer of epihalohydrin which comprises treating an enantiomer of an alcohol having the formulaEMI1.1 wherein Z is phenyl, monosubstitued phenyl, CF3 or C1 C6 alkyl and X is Cl or Br with an alkali metal glycolate and recovering said epihalohydrin by distillation. The reaction is illustrated by the followingEMI2.1 The product as recovered in good yield by direct vacuum distillation at room temperature from the reaction mixture. Z may be phenyl, monosubstituted phenyl orC1 C6 alkyl. The monosubstituted phenyl group is exemplified by Cl C3 alkylphenyl e.g. p propylphenyl, o methylphenyl, and m ethylphenyl, p N02 phenyl, p OCH3 phenyl, 2 chlorophenyl and the like. The C1 C6 alkyl group includesCH3, C CH3 3, isopropyl, n hexyl and the like. The p methyiphenyl and CH3 groups are preferred. The alkali metal glycolate includes K or Na ethylene glycolate, with Naethylene glycolate being preferred. When a more conventional low boiling solvent strong base, e.g. methanol NaOCH3 is used in place of the glycolate in reaction the product yield obtained on direct vacuum distillation at room temperature is low. Another embodiment of the present invention is a process for preparing S glycerol l, 2 acetonide of the formulaEMI2.2 which comprises a a treating 1,2 5,6 di 0 isopro pylidine D mannitol having the formulaEMI3.1 with lead tetraacetate in a suitable solvent and b reducing the reaction product from a with alkalimetal borohydride and c treating the reaction mixture from b with an ammonium halide. Suitable solvents include aprotic compounds such as tetrahydrofuron THF , ethylacetate, dimethylformamide DMF and the like. THF and ethylacetate are preferred solvents. Ammonium halides include NE4Br and NH4C1.NH4C1 is preferred. The reaction of B with Pb OAc 4 in step a may be carried out at any convenient temperature. Temperatures below about 10 C are preferred. The preferred molar nature of leadtetraacetate to B is about 1 1. The reduction of the step b is also carried out at a convenient temperature. Preferred temperatures are below about 10 C. The NaBH4 reducing agent is generally added to the reaction mixture in solution e.g. in aqueous NaOH. The amount of NaBH4 may be varied. It is preferred that about 2 moles of NaBH4 per mole of B reactant be used. The reaction of step b is allowed to proceed for a period sufficient for the reaction to be complete, e.g. for about 30 minutes at about O0C and for about 90 minutes at room temperature. At the appropriate time,NH4C1 is added to solution until the PH reaches about 8.After the reaction solvent is removed under reduced pressure, the produce A is recovered using conventional procedures. When sodium periodate synthesis 423 1977 Biochemistry 3, 976 1964 is used in place of Pb OAc 4 the product obtained is generally racemic. When H2 Raney nickel 1J. Biol. hem. 128, 463 1939 is used in place of the NaBH4, yields obtained are variable depending on the quality of the Raney nickel. The formula A glycerol is especially useful as an intermediate in the preparation of S and R epihalohydrins. The following flow sheet illustrates this utility EMI5.1 Reactions related to 1 and 2 are disclosed in J.A.C.S. 64, 1291 1942 . Reaction 3 is related to that described in Tetrahedron Letters, 4361 1969 . Reaction sequence 5 and 6 has been carried out with racemic reactants Bull. Chem. Soc.Japan 39, 413 1966 . The preparation illustrated by the flow sheet shows that either the S or R enantiomer of an epihalohydrin, especially epichlorohydrin, can be prepared directly from a common starting material compound A or product B without requiring costly and inefficient resolution procedures. This constitutes another aspect of the present invention. Epihalohydrins have wide utility in organic synthesis. The enantiomers of epihalohydrin may be especially useful to prepare intermediates which in turn can be used to prepare specific isomers which have pharmaceutical utility. One such preparation is illustrated by the following reaction equations REACTION SEQUENCE AEMI7.1 STEP 2EMI7.2 The product C is a commercial ss adrenergic blocking agent. Other preparations utilizing the Step 1, sequence A type reaction are illustrated by the following reaction equation REACTION 3 EMI8.1 X X in this equation is H, CHO, CN or OCH3. Where a stronger base, such as NaH in DMFJ is used in the above reactions, the intermediate C or C1 is obtained as a mixture of S and R isomer. Another aspect of the present invention relates to the novel sulfonyl intermediates of the type obtained in Step 5 in the above flow sheet.These compounds are represented by the formulaEMI8.2 where L may be an alkyl group such a. CH3, C4H9, CF3 and the like, or a phenyl group such as phenyl, p chlorophenyl, p tolyl, p nitrophenyl and the like. The formula E compounds are useful as intermediates in reactions related to Reactions A and B as illustrated by the following equation REACTION CEMI9.1 aryl includes groups such as phenyl,EMI9.2 where X is a substituent such as chloro, CHO, CN, C1 C4 alkoxy and the like, pyridyl, cyanopyridyl 4 morpholino 1,2,5 thiadiazolyl and the like. When an enantiomer i.e. R or S isomer, of the E compound is used in the reaction, the type of base and the L group have an effect on the isomer configuration of the final product. Illustrating this effect are the following two equations REACTION DEMI10.1 mixture of R and S isomers about 80 S isomerREACTION EEMI10.2 100 S isomer Thus, where L is CF3 and a strong base is used, the S isomer of the formula E compounds yields the S isomer of the formula G compound. Therefore, by utilizing an enantiomer of 3 trifloxy 1,2 epoxy propane and a suitable base in the C reaction the isomeric configuration of the trifloxy enantiomer is maintained in the product. If an enantiomer of mesyloxy mesyloxyepoxypropane is used, a mixture of enantiomers is obtained. The following example describes the prepara tion of S 3 trifloxy 1,2 epoxypropane. All temperatures are in C.
