Futhermore, the invention relates to a biologically pure culture producing one or more of this antibiotics. TAN 749A and C and TAN 749B and D are expressed by the formulas, C₁₅H₂₇N₅O₃ and C₁₆H₂₉N₅O₃, respectively. Antibiotics possessing a similar molecular formula include leucylnegamycin molecular formula C₁₅H₃₁N₅O₅ , which is produced by the microbe belonging to the genus Due to the development of therapeutics using antibiotics, bacterial diseases for the most part have been overcome however, there are still some important problems in the field of infectious disease medicine. For example, long term or high dose medication with conventional antibiotics causes changes in the flora of disease causative bacteria replacement of bacteria or the advent of drug resistant bacteria acquisition of drug resistance , resulting in an increase in diseases therapeutics for people lacking auto immunity are much needed. Such antibiotics possessing a novel structure and thus novel biological activity, or intermediate materials for their synthesis, are needed to solve these problems. The present inventors isolated a great number of bacterial species from the soil in search for new antibiotics and then separated and investigated antibiotics produced by those species, finding that some microbes produce a new antibiotic. These microbes belong to the genus Therefore, the present invention relates to Antibiotics TAN 749A, B, C and D which possess the following physical and chemical properties as dihydrochlorides, or their salts. In the present specification, antibiotics TAN 749A, B, C and D, or each of them, is generally called antibiotic TAN 749 or simply TAN 749 in some cases. Based on these findings, the inventors made further studies to complete the present invention. The present invention relates to 1 antibiotics TAN 749A, B, C and D, or their salts and 2 a method for producing antibiotics TAN 749A, B, C and D, or their salts, characterized in that microbes belonging to the genus Bacteria which can be used in the present method as microbes producing antibiotic TAN 749 include all microbes belonging to the genus Strain YK 437 has the following bacteriological characteristics Strain YK 437 was collated with bacterial species described in Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 8th edition, or the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, Vol. 30, pp. 225 420 1980 and validation lists shown in the journal this strain was thought of as belonging to the genus According to said Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriorogy, the genus Table 1 shows the characteristics of the strain YK 437 as obtained by further experiments. It was considered appropriate that the strain YK 437 belongs to the Section I on the basis of the facts that the strain has no auxotrophy and doesn t accumulate poly β hydroxybutyrate as an intracellular carbon reserve. Ten species are included in Section I. As the strain YK 437 produces fluorochrome and possesses arginine dihydrolase, the strain YK 437 was thought of as belonging to any of The strain YK 437 is different from The above described characteristics of the strain YK 437 are in good agreement with those of This microbe, which was deposited on June 15, 1985 at Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan FRI under the accession number of FERM P 8312, the deposit being converted to a deposit under the Budapest Treaty, has been stored at FRI under the accession number of FERM BP 1005. Bacteria belonging to the genus In the incubation of TAN 749 producing bacteria, substances which can be assimilated by the bacteria are used properly as carbon sources glucose, maltose, lactose, blackstrap molasses, oil and fats soybean oil, olive oil, etc. , and organic acids citric acid, succinic acid, gluconic acid, etc. . As nitrogen sources, various organic or inorganic nitrogen compounds can be used soybean flour, cotton seed powder, corn steep liquor, dried yeast, yeast extract, meat extract, peptone, urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, and ammonium phosphate. Inorganic salts such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, potassium primary phosphate and potassium secondary phosphate, which are essential to ordinary bacterial cultures, can be properly used singly or in combination. Heavy metals such as ferrous sulfate and copper sulfate, and vitamins such as vitamin B₁ and biotin, are added if required. Antifoaming agents such as silicon oil and polyalkylene glycol ether, and surface active agents, can also be added to the medium. Other organic or inorganic substances which facilitate bacterial growth and thus promote TAN 749 production can also be added. As for culture methods, ordinary production methods for antibiotics can be applied solid and liquid cultures are both applicable. In the case of liquid cultures, any of standing cultures, shaking cultures, submerged culture, aeration cultures, etc. can be conducted the aeration submerged culture is especially preferable. Culture temperature can be chosen in a range of approx. 10 C to 30 C it is recommended that the incubation be conducted between approx. 17 C and 24 C. A medium pH can be chosen in a range of approx. 4 to 8 recommended pH ranges from approx. 6 to 7. The culture should be performed for approx. 8 to 168 hours, preferably approx. 24 to 144 hours. In collecting TAN 749, the purposed product, from cultures, separation methods which are usually employed to collect metabolites produced by microbes from their cultures can properly be used. For example, TAN 749, which behaves as a water soluble alkaline substance, and is thus contained mainly in culture filtrate, can be collected by performing the following procedures. That is, the culture liquid, after addition of a filter aid, is subjected to filtration or centrifugation to remove bacterial cells. The resulting culture filtrate is put in contact with a proper carrier to adsorb biologically active components in the filtrate, and the active components are then desorbed using an appropriate solvent to separate and recover the purposed products. Chromatographic carriers which can be used favorably include compounds with which adsorbability difference is applied, such as activated charcoal, powdered cellulose and adsorptive resins, those with which functional group difference is applied, such as cation exchange resins, cation exchange cellulose and cation exchange dextran gel, and those with which a molecular weight difference is applied, such as dextran gel. Eluents which can be used in proper combination to elute purposed compounds from these carriers include hydrated solutions of water soluble organic solvents, such as hydrated acetone and hydrated alcohols, and aqueous solutions containing acids, alkalis, buffer solutions, organic salts or inorganic salts, though combination varies with carrier types and qualities. In some cases, crude products containing antibiotics, obtained using these chromatographic methods, are subjected to HPLC for separation to obtain purified products. Methods for recovering TAN 749 are described in more detail hereinafter. Antibacterial substances contained in the filtrate can be adsorbed using cation exchange resins such as Amberlite IRC 50 and CG 50 Rohm Haas Co., USA and then eluted using aqueous solutions or buffer solutions containing salts or acids. Antibiotics can be adsorbed also using cation exchange dextran gels such as CM Sephadex Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Sweden and then eluted using aqueous or buffer solutions containing salts or acids. It is recommended that activated charcoal for chromatography Takeda Chemical Industries Co., Ltd., Japan or adsorptive resins such as Diaion HP 20 and SP 207 Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Co., Ltd., Japan and Amberlite XAD II Rohm Haas Co., USA be used to remove salts and coloring substances, etc. from resulting eluates. Eluted fractions are powdered via processes including concentration and lyophilization. When the resulting powder is low in purity, the use of HPLC is recommended for further purification. Carriers which can be used in such HPLC include TSK gel Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Japan and YMC gel Yamamura Chemical Laboratories, Japan . As for mobile phase, mixed solutions of methanol, acetonitrile, etc. and an aqueous or buffer solutions containing inorganic salts, can be used. TAN 749 is separated in the form of a salt of mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, or of organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid. TAN 749 salts separated in the processes shown above can be converted into free TAN 749 compounds using conventional methods, and said free compounds can be converted into the same salts as above using conventional methods. Dihydrochlorides of TAN 749A, B, C and D, which were obtained in Example 1 shown later , possess the following physical and chemical properties As is evident from the physical and chemical properties described above, TAN 749A and C, and TAN 749B and D, are stereoisomers of each other, respectively.

Table 4 shows the antibacterial activities of TAN 749A dihydrochloride against clinically isolated Table 5 shows the therapeutic effects of TAN 749A, B C and D dihydrochlorides to infectious diseases in mice. Table 6 shows the preliminary acute toxicities of TAN 749A and B dihydrochlorides in mice. As described clearly from these data, TAN 749 and its salts have antibacterial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria and their acute toxicities in mammals are low. Moreover, they are effective to various types of drug resistant bacteria and do not show cross resistance. TAN 749 or its salts can be used as therapeutic drugs in the following manners TAN 749 or its salts, is mixed with pharmacologically allowable carriers. For instance, in the production of oral preparations, there may be employed suitable amounts of binders e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, macrogol, etc. , disintegrators e.g. starch, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, etc. , excipients e.g. lactose, starch, etc. , lubricants e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, etc. and so on. In the production of parenteral therapeutics e.g. injections, there may be employed isotonicating agents e.g. glucose, D sorbitol, D mannitol, sodium chloride, etc. , preservatives e.g. benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, methyl p hydroxybenzoate, propyl p phydroxybenzoate, etc. , buffers e.g. phophate buffer, sodium acetate buffer, etc. and so on. They are given parenterally to said mammals via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection at a dose of approx. 1 to 50mg kg day, preferably approx. 5 to 20mg kg day. When TAN 749 or its salt is given orally, they can be given in the form of capsules at a TAN 749 dose of approx. 1 to 100mg kg day it is recommended that the dose is between approx. 5 and 50mg kg day. TAN 749 or its salts can be used as bactericides. For example, hands, legs, faces, ears, etc. can be sterilized and disinfected by applying it over these portions as a liquid prepared by disslolving TAN 749 or its salts in distilled water at a concentration approx. 0.01 to 0.1 w v or an ointment containing approx. 0.2 to 20mg, preferably approx. 1 to 10mg, of TAN 749 per gram.
