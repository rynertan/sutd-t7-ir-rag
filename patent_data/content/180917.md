# EXHAUST GAS TURBINE TYPE SUPERCHARGER

## Abstract
Herein disclosed in an exhaust gas turbine type super charger in which a casing of a turbine 6 is divided into two chambers 4, 5 along a flow direction of the exhaust gas to form an open scroll 4 and a closed scroll 5 . The open scroll 4 feeds the turbine 6 with the exhaust gas over a full operational range of the engine 1 . The closed scroll is opened to increase a flow rate of the exhaust gas to the turbine 6 when the supercharged pressure is high as in a high load high speed operation of the engine 1 . A port 7 is formed through a partitioning wall between the open scroll 4 and a downstream exhaust gas passage of the turbine and an opening closing valve is interposed thereat to thereby bypass the exhaust gas to a downstream portion of the turbine 6 with the port 7 being opened, when the supercharged pressure becomes high.
