## Description
ARTICLE CARRIER AND BLANK THEREFOR TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to article carriers which are economical to manufacture and at the same time are well adapted for use in connection with returnable primary packages. BACKGROUND ART Various methods have been utilized in the past in order to render conventional nonreturnable article carriers suitable for use in connection with returnable articles such as are currently widely accepted by the consuming public. An example of this type of carrier in one form is disclosed inU.S. patent 3,356,258. A recurring problem with these carriers is that whenever the carrier is opened to gain access to the articles, it is severely weakened which hampers or renders impossible its use in connection with returnables. More recently the fully enclosed type carrier has been adopted for use with returnable articles.U.S. patent Re. 29,063 discloses an enclosed returnable carrier which, unlike the present invention, is of the wraparound type and U.S. patent 3,090,520 discloses a side loading carrier which is not well adapted for use as a returnable carrier. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION According to this invention in one form, an article carrier is provided and comprises a bottom wall with side wall means and end walls upstanding therefrom, a top panel secured to the upper edges of the side wall means and the end walls, at least a portion of the top panel being removable, a secondary bottom panel secured in overlying relationship with the bottom wall, and handle means secured to the secondary bottom panel and upstanding therefrom. According to this invention in another form, an article carrier is provided and comprises a bottom wall with side wall means and end walls upstanding therefrom, and interconhected with each other at adjacent ends, a top panel secured to the upper edges of the side wall means and the end walls, at least a portion of the top panel being removable, a supplementary bottom panel secured to an end edge of the bottom wall, and handle means joined to the supplementary bottom panel and interconnected with one of the end walls, the handle means also forming a medial partition for the carrier.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION With reference to the drawings and with particular reference to FIG. 4, the numeral 1 designates the bottom wall of the carrier to the side edges of which a portion of the side wall means in the form of lower side wall panels 2 and 3 is foldably joined along fold lines 4 and 5. To one end edge of bottom wall 1, secondary bottom panel 6 is foldably joined along fold line 7.In order to facilitate machine manipulation of the blank by eliminating some of the inherent stiffness in the paperboard material, bend lines 6a, 6b, and 6c are provided and are formed in secondary bottom panel 6. Handle means for the carrier is provided in the form of handle panel 8 which is foldably joined to one side of secondary bottom panel 6 along fold lines 9 and 10 and handle panel 11 which is foldably joined to the other side of secondary bottom panel 6 along fold lines 12 and 13. Although two handle panels are shown in the drawings the handle means can also comprise cnly one handle panel. Formed along the lower portions of handle panels 8 and 11 is cushioning means for the purpose of separating the articles disposed in the transverse direction of the carrier. Specifically cushioning panels 14, 15 and 16 are formed along the lower portion of handle panel 8 and cushioning panels 17, 18 and 19 are formed along the lower portion of handle panel 11.As is apparent from FIGS. 4 and 5, the lower edges of the cushioning panels 14 19 are curved.This feature of the invention facilitates the smooth entry of the articles onto secondary bottom panel 6 during the article loading operation. To the other end edge of bottom wall 1, end wall 20 is foldably joined along fold line 21. In addition flaps 22 and 23 are foldably joined respectively to end wall 20 along fold lines 24 and 25. Similarly flaps 26 and 27 are foldably joined respectively to end wall 20 along fold lines 28 and 29. According to this invention in one form, top panel or top wall 30 is foldably joined to the upper edge of end wall 20 along interrupted fold line 31. Carrier side wall means includes upper side wall panel 32 which is joined to top panel 30 along fold lines 33 and 34 as well as along severance lines 35 and 36 and upper side wall panel 37 which is joined to top panel 30 along fold lines 38 and 39 as well as along severance lines 40 and 41. Also severance lines 42 and 43 are formed in top panel 30 at one end thereof and severance lines 44 and 45 are formed in top panel 30 at the other end thereof. In order to facilitate opening of the carrier, thumb tab 46 is formed in top panel 30 and, adjacent to thumb tab 46, cut lines 47 and 48 are formed in the upper portion.of end wall 20.For use in connection with the gluing of the carrier, fold lines 49 and 50 are formed respectively in upper side wall panels 32 and 37. According to another feature of this invention, V shaped bend lines 51 and 52 are formed in top panel 30. Each of theV shaped bend lines 51 and 52 comprises side elements A and B.As is apparent from FIG. 4, the side elements A and B of eachV shaped bend line 51 and 52 diverge in a direction toward thumb tab 46 which is the point at which removal of carrier top panel 30 is initiated. Additionally corner sections 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d are disposed at the respective corners of top panel 30 To complete the basic elements of the blank, end wall 53 is foldably joined to an end edge of top panel 30 along fold line 54. Flaps 55 and 56 are foldably joined respectively to end wall 53 along fold lines 57 and 58. Likewise flaps 59 and 60 are foldably joined respectively to end wall 53 along fiLd lines 61 and 62. In addition glue flap 63 is joined to end wall 53 along fold line 64. For the purpose of facilitating transport of the carrier, finger gripping apertures 65 and 66 are formed in top panel 30 and are defined by cushioning tabs 67 and 68 which are foldably joined respectively to top panel 30 along fold lines 69 and 70.To receive the necks of the packaged articles, neck receiving apertures 71 76 are provided. For the purpose of insuring proper tearing of top panel 30, slits 42a and 43a are formed respectively on the periphery of neck receiving apertures 71 and 74. In order to reduce the amount of light which enters the carrier, a pair of tabs X and Y are associated with each neck receiving aperture. To properly cushion and separate the heels of adjacent articles disposed in the longitudinal direction of the carrier, cushioning tabs 77 84 are provided and are foldably joined respectively to bottom wall 1 along fold lines 85 92. In addition each cushioning tab is provided with cutaway portionC, the purpose of which is described and claimed in U.S. patent application serial number 933,488 filed August 14, 1978 and which is owned by the assignee of this invention. Finger gripping apertures 93 and 94 are formed in handle panel 8 and, similarly, finger gripping apertures 95 and 96 are formed in handle panel 11. Also cushioning flaps 97 and 98 are foldably joined respectively to handle panel 8 along fold lines 99 and 100. In like fashion, cushioning flaps 101, and 102 are foldably joined respectively to handle panel 11 along fold lines 103 and 104. Cuts 97a, 98a, lOla, and 102 a are formed respectively in cushioning flaps 97, 98, 101 and 102. According to a feature of this invention, finger gripping aperture 94 is slightly larger in size than corresponding finger gripping aperture 96 and likewise, finger gripping aperture 95 is slightly larger in size than corresponding finger gripping aperture 93. To maintain the various elements of the blank in the proper relative positions during formation of the carrier, nicks N areprovided at the lowermost points of cushioning panels 14 19 as well as along the outer edges of cushioning flaps 97, 98, 101, and 102. Nicks N simply constitute small paperboard connections between adjacent elements of the blank and are easily broken whenever the carrier is loaded or transported. In order to form the carrier from the blank shown in FIG. 4, initially it is necessary to make an application of glue to secondary bottom panel 6 as shown by stippling in FIG. 4. Then secondary bottom panel 6 together with handle panels 8 and 11 are elevated and folded over along fold line 7 to occupy the positions shown in FIG. 5. By this operation secondary bottom panel 6 is adhered to the upper surface of bottom wall 1. Following this operation, bottom wall 1 together with secondary bottom panel 6 and handle panels 8 and 11 are all elevated and folded over along fold line 21 to occupy the positions shown in FIG. 6. Then an application of glue is made to glue flap 63 as shown by stippling in FIG. 6. Thereafter end wall 53 and the associated structure are elevated and folded over along fold line 54 to occupy the positions shown in FIG. 7. By this operation glue flap 63 is adhered to bottom wall 1. In order to set up the carrier from the collapsed condition shown in FIG. 6, it is simply necessary to manipulate the blank into a position whereby the end walls are parallel to eadh other and, likewise, whereby the top panel and bottom wall are also parallel to each other. Following this handle panels 8 and 11 are swung upwardly into vertical positions whereby they are disposed substantially perpendicular to bottom wall 1 and secondary bottom panel 6. Also cushioning tabs 77 84 are elevated into vertical positions.Then upper side wall panels 32 and 37 are swung upwardly into substantially vertical positions and lower side wall panels 2 and 3 are manipulated into horizontal positions. The carrier then appears as shown in FIG. 8. In order to load the carrier, articles are guided into the article cells by means of appropriate article loading machinery. Subsequent to this flaps 22, 23, 26, 27, 55, 56 59 and 60 are swung inwardly of the carrier and glue is applied to flaps 23, 27, 55 and 59. Thereafter lower side wall panels 2 and 3 are elevated and secured to the associated flaps.Then upper side wall panels 32 and 37 are lowered and, generally simultaneously with this operation, the ends 0 thereof are rotated outwardly approximately 180 along fold lines 49 and 50 respectively. Glue is then applied to the exposed end portions of upper side wall panels 32 and 37 which are then rotated into a glued relationship with the respective lower side wall panels 2 and 3. The carrier then appears as shown in FIG. 1. In order to open the carrier for removal of the packaged articles, it is simply necessary to grasp thumb tab 46 and to pill top panel 30 upwardly. By this operation the inner portion of top panel 30 is severed along severance lines 44, 45, 36, 41, 35, 40, 42 and 43 and slits 42a and 43a.The carrier then appears as shown in FIG. 3. When the inner portion of top panel 30 is removed, tearing thereof in a manner other than along the desired severance lines is prevented by means of V shaped bend lines 51 and 52. As the removal of top panel 30 is initiated by the lifting of thumb tab 46 and tearing along severance lines 44 and 45, the V shaped orientation of V shaped bend line 51 causes the portions of top panel 30 on either side of the side elements A and B to form upwardly diverging relationships therefrom. This in turn causes a tension force at points D and E along the side edges of top panel 30 at which points tearing is caused to occur and then continue along severance lines 36 and 41. Therefore by this invention any undesired tearing of top panel 30 is prevented especially as commonly occurs about the inner edges of the associated neck receiving apertures such as elements 73 and 76.The same structural relationships exist in connection with V shaped bend line 52. Therefore after the removable portion of top panel 30 has been discarded, the articles are removed and the contents thereof consumed as desired. The empty articles can then simply be placed into the carrier which is conventiently returned to the point of purchase by proper utilization of the handle means in the form of handle panels 8 and 11. Since at least a portion of the bottom of each article is disposed on secondary bottom panel 6, added reinforcement is achieved when the carrier is lifted by means of handle panels 8 and 11. Further strength is achieved by means of corner sections 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d which operate to connect upper side wall panels 32 and 37 to end walls 20 and 53. According to another feature of this invention, finger gripping aperture 94 is somewhat larger in size than corresponding finger gripping aperture 96. As cushioning flap 98 is forced into finger gripping aperture 96, it tends to bind against the sides of finger gripping aperture 96 since it is slightly wider. Therefore handle panels 8 and 11 are locked in upright positions and do not separate and interfere with removal and replacement of the articles. Of course if the user s fingers are inserted through the other side of the handle means, the same relationship exists in the opposite direction between finger gripping aperture 95 and finger gripping aperture 93. A second article carrier embodying the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings and with particular reference to FIG. 3a, the numeral 1 designates the bottom wall of the second carrier. tower side wall panels 2 and 3 , forming a portion of the carrier side wall means are foldably joined along fold lines 4 and 5 respectively to the side edges of bottom wall 1 . To one end edgeof bottom wall 1 , supplementary bottom panel 6 is foldably joined along fold line 7 . Handle means for the second carrier is provided in the form of handle panels 8 and 9 which are foldably joined together along fold line 10 . In addition handle panel 9 is joined to supplementary bottom panel 6 along spaced parallel fold lines 11 and 12 . Fastening tab 13 is struck from handle panel 9 and is joined to handle panel 8 along spaced parallel fold lines 14 and 15 . Connecting panels 16 and 17 are struck from the handle means and are foldably joined respectively to handle panels 8 and 9 along diagonal fold lines 18 and 19 . Anchoring tab 20 is also struck from handle means and is formed intermediate connecting panels 16 and 17 and is foldably joined thereto respectively along interrupted fold lines 21 and 22 . Although two handle panels are shown inthe drawings, the handle means can also comprise only one handle panel in which case either connecting panel 16 or 17 would be omitted as is obvious. To the other end edge of bottom wall 1 , end wall 23 is foldably joined along fold line 24 . In addition flaps 25 and 26 are foldably joined respectively to end wall 23 along fold lines 27 and 28 . Similarly flaps 29 and 30 are foldably joined respectively to end wall 23 along fold lines 31 and 32 . Top panel or top wall 33 is foldably joined to the upper edge of end wall 23 along interrupted fold line 34 .Carrier side wall means includes upper side wall panel 15 which is joined to top panel 33 along fold lines 36 and 37 as well as along weakened severance lines 38 and 39 and upper side wall panel 40 which is joined to top panel 33 along fold lines 41 and 42 as well as along weakened severance lines 43 and 44 . Also weakened severance lines 45 and 46 are formed in top panel 33 at one end thereof and similar severance lines 47 and 48 are formed in top, panel 33 at the other end thereof. In order to facilitate opening of the carrier, thumb tab 49 is formed in top panel 33 and, adjacent to thumb tab 49 , cut lines 50 and 51 are formed in the upper portion of end wall 23 . In order to facilitate gluing of the second carrier, fold lines 52 and 53 are formed respectively in upper side wall panels 35 and 40 . In addition V shaped bend lines 54 and 55 as well as corner sections 56 , 57 , 58 and 59 are formed in top panel 33 . These features are described in detail in relation to the previous embodiment. To complete the basic elements of the blank, end wall 60 is foldably joined to an end edge of top panel 33 along fold line 61 . Flaps 62 and 63 are foldably joined respectively to end wall 60 along fold lines 64 and 65 .Likewise flaps 66 and 67 are foldably joined respectively to end wall 60 along fold lines 68 and 69 . In addition glue flap 70 is joined to end wall 60 along fold line 71 . For the purpose of facilitating transport of the carrier, finger gripping apertures 72 and 73 are formed in top panel 33 and are foldably joined respectively thereto along fold lines 74 and 75 . To receive the necks of the packages articles, neck receiving apertures 76 81 are provided. For the purpose of insuring proper tearing of top panel 33 , slits 82 and 83 are formed respectively on the periphery of neck receiving apertures 76 and 79 . To properly cushion and separate the heels of adjacent articles, cushioning tabs 84 95 are struck from bottom wall 1 . Cushioning tabs 84 93 are foldably joined respectively to bottom wall 1 along fold lines 96 105 . In addition cushioning tab 94 is joined to bottom wall 1 along parallel spaced fold lines 106 and 107 and, likewise, cushioning tab 95 is joined to bottom wall 1 along parallel spaced fold lines 108 and 109 . Finger gripping apertures 110 and 111 are formed in handle panel 8 and, similarly, finger gripping apertures 112 and 113 are formed in handle panel 9 . Also cushioning flaps 114 and 115 are foldably joined respectively to handle panel 8 along fold lines 116 and 117 . In like fashion, cushioning flaps 118 and 119 are foldably joined respectively to handle panel 9 along fold lines 120 and 121 . In order to form the second carrier from the blank shown in FIG. 3a, initially it is necessary to make an application of glue to supplementary bottom panel 6 , cushioning tabs 94 and 95 and fastening tab 13 as shown by stippling in FIG. 3a. Then supplementary bottom panel 6 together with handle panels 8 and 9 and the associated structure are elevated and folded over along fold line 7 to occupy the positions shown in FIG. 4a. By this operation, supplementary bottom panel 6 and fastening tab 13 are adhered to the upper surface of bottom wall 1 . Also cushioning tabs 94 and 95 are adhered respectively to handle panels 9 and 8 . Following this operation, an application of glue is made to the exposed surface of anchoring tab 20 as shown by stippling in FIG. 4a. Then bottom wall 1 together with supplementary bottom panel 6 and handle panels 8 and 9 are all elevated and folded over along fold line 24 to occupy the positions shown in FIG. 5a. Anchoring tab 20 is then adhered to the inner surface of end wall 23 . Then an application of glue is made to glue flap 70 as shown by stippling in FIG. 5a. Thereafter end wall 60 and the associated structure are elevated and folded over along fold line 61 to occupy the positions shown in FIG. 6a. By this operation, glue flap 70 is adhered to bottom wall 1 . In order to set up the second carrier from the collapsed condition shown in FIG. 6a, it is simply necessary to manipulate the blank into a position whereby the end walls are parallel to each other and whereby the top panel and bottom wall are also parallel to each other. Simultaneously with this, handle panels 8 and 9 and cushioning tabs 94 and 95 are pulled upwardly automatically into vertical positions by connecting panels 16 and 17 and anchoring tab 20 whereby they are disposed substantially perpendicular to bottom wall 1 and in overlapping relationship respectively with connecting panels 16 and 17 . Also cushioning tabs 84 93 are elevated into vertical positions. Cushioning tabs 88 and 89 in effect fill the void formed by connecting panels 16 and 17 when set up.Then upper side wall panels 35 and 40 are swung upwardly into substantially vertical positions and lower side wall panels 2 and 3 are manipulated into horizontal positions.The second carrier then appears as shown in FIG. 7a and is in condition for loading through its sides. In order to load the second carrier, articles are guided into the article cells from both sides by means of appropriate article loading machinery. Subsequent to this flaps 25t, 26 , 29 , 30 , 62 , 63 , 66 and 67 are swung inwardly of the carrier and glue is applied to flaps 26 , 30 , 63 and 67 . Thereafter lower side wall panels 2 and 3 are elevated and secured to the associated flaps. Then upper side wall panels 35 and 40 are lowered and, generally simultaneously with this operation, the ends thereof are 6 rotated outwardly approximately 180 along fold lines 52 and 53 respectively. Glue is then applied to the exposed end portions of upper side wall panels 35 and 40 which are then rotated into a glued relationship with the respective lower side wall panels 2 and 3 .The second carrier then appears as shown in FIG. la. In order to open the second carrier for removal of the packaged articles, it is simply necessary to grasp thumb tab 49 and to pull top panel 33 upwardly as shown in FIG. 2a.By this operation the inner portion of top panel 33 is severed along weakened severance lines 47 , 48 , 39 , 44 , 38 , 43 , 45 and 46 and slits 82 and 83 . A modification of the second carrier is depicted inFIGS 10 and 11. Corresponding elements of the second carrier are identified in FIGS. 10 and 11 with the subscript a .From FIG. 10 it is apparent that cushioning tabs 88 , 89 , 94 and 95 as shown in the blank of FIG. 3a are omitted. Also fastening tab 13 is omitted and supplementary bottom panel 6 is extended in order to provide a greater amount of material to be adhered to bottom wall 1 . Additionally cushioning tabs 122 and 123 are integrally formed respectively along the lower portions of connecting panels 16 and 17 . As shown in FIG. 11 cushioning tabs 122 and 123 in effect replace cushioning tabs 88 and 89 of the version of this invention shown in FIGS. la 9. Thus, a strong carrier is provided since handle panels 8 and 9 are directly secured to the carrier bottom and are secured to one of the carrier end walls by means of connecting panels 16 and 17 and anchoring tab 20 . As a result any tendency for the handle structure to separate from the bottom wall is greatly reduced. Also, in the completed carrier, spaced parallel fold lines 11 and 12 are disposed in coincidence respectively with spaced fold lines 106 and 107 . Likewise spaced fold lines 14 and 15 are disposed respectively in coincidence with spaced fold lines 109 and 108 . A double thickness of paperboard is provided at the various points of article contact and these spaced parallel fold lines facilitate manipulation and folding of cushioning tabs 94 and 95 at the points where the carrier paperboard is of double thickness and particularly difficult to bend. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY By this invention an article carrier is provided which is strong, durable and economical and at the same time can be opened conveniently and reused in connection with returnable articles.
