# TW EDM method and apparatus with a ferromagnetic wire electrode.

## Abstract
Apparatus for machining an electrically conductive workpiece 7 with a ferromagnetic wire electrode 1 , includes guide rollers 3, 4, 5 for axially transporting the wire electrode 1 from a supply reel 2 along a predetermined path of travel to cause it to travel through a machining zone in the workpiece 7 and to be taken up onto a takeup reel 2 . A supply 28 provides a flushing liquid medium which is directed into a machining gap between the electrode wire 1 and the workpiece in said machining zone. A power supply 17 effects a succession of electrical discharges across said gap between the workpiece and the electrode wire 1 to electroerosively remove material from the workpiece 7 . Drive motors MX, MY act to relatively displace the wire electrode 1 and the workpiece 7 transversely to each other along a programmed path to advance erosive material removal therealong. A magnetic detector 30 is disposed downstream of the machining zone in the predetermined path of travel for sens ing a magnetic property of the electrode wire as it passes out of said machining zone to produce a signal representing a disturbance of the electrical discharges from a predetermined machining mode in the machining zone.
