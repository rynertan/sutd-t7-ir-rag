## Description
diagnostic kit and method for assaying blood components BACKGROUND OF THE DNVENMON The present invention relates to both a method and a diagnostic kit for screening human and animal plasmas for various blood abnormalities, including deficiencies in factor VIUR WF vonWillebrand s factor activity von Willebrand s disease andBernard Soulier syndrome. The present invention can also be used to differentiate between individuals suffering from Type I and TypeII von WiUebrand s disease, respectively. One of the important blood components necessary for ade quate primary hemostasis is factor VIIIR WP, or von Willebrand s factor vWF , also known as platelet agglutinating factor PAF or vWF PAF , as ristocetin cofactor n and as bovine or porcine antihemophilic factor. This plasma protein is quantitatively or qualitatively abnormal in von Willebrand s disease vascular hemophilia , which occurs in man and animals e.g., dog and pig . In Type I von Willebrand s disease, the levels of factor VIIIR WF are reduced, or the factor may be absent. In Type II von Willebrand s disease, the ievels of ristocetin induced cofactor activity are reduced, but the levels of factor VIIIR WF activity induced by certain snake venoms are normal Howard et al., The agglutination of human platelets by botrocetin Evidence that botro cetin and ristocetin act at different sites of the factor vm molecule and platelet membrane, Brit. J. Haematol. 57 25 35, 1984, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference .Thus, while the vWF protein is present in normal quantities in individuals who have Type II von Willebrand s disease, the protein is functionally abnormal. This plasma factor is also altered in certain disease states, and is thought to be important in the recruitment of platelets to sites of developing atherosclerosis. Accordingly, in treating patients with stored blood components, e.g., to control hemorrhaging or to replace lost blood, it is important to be able to determine quickly the amount of factor VIIIR WF activity in the stored blood component. Clinically, there are three methods of measuring factor V1IIR WF activity in plasma 1 platelet agglutination to various cofactors in an aggregometer, which is essentially a modified spectrophotometer 2 the macroscopic platelet agglutination time in a test tube and 3 immunophoresis of plasma for factor V1IIR WF related antigen factor YIIIR Ag , a large protein which contains factor VIJIR WF. Methods 1 and 2 involve the use of a citrated plasma or other body fluid to be tested for factor VUIR WF activity b a suspension of platelets for the determination of the rate of platelet agglutination and c a cofactor such as ristocetin, snake venom, and bovine or porcine antihemophilic factor to induce platelet agglutination. Method 3 utilizes citrated plasma and specific antibodies to factor VmR Ag. Platelet agglutination to ristocetin in an aggregometer, using fresh platelet rich plasma or fixed platelets resuspended in platelet poor plasma, has been described, for example, by Howard et al., Ristocetin a new tool in the investigation of platelet aggregation, Thromb. Diath. Hsemorrh. 26 362 369, 1971 Weiss et al., Quantitative assay of plasma factor deficient in vonWillebrand s disease that is necessary for platelet aggregation, J.Clin. Invest. 52 2708 2716, 1973 Macfarlane et al., A method for assaying von Willebrand factor ristocetin cofactor , Thromb.Diath. Haemorrh. 34 306 308, 1975 and Allain et al., Platelets fixed with paraformaldehyde A new reagent for assay of vonWillebrand factor and platelet aggregating factor, J. Lab. Clin. Med. 85 318 328, 1975. Fresh washed platelets, fixed platelets and cryopreserved platelets i. e., platelets previously frozen in solution or lyophilized can be used in this procedure as the agglutinating substrate see, e.g., Odink, Platelet presersratiori. 11. The response of human platelet suspensions of hypotonic stress, Thomb. Haemostas. 36 182 191, 1976 . Ristocetin, certain snake venoms, polybrene, and bovine or porcine antihemophilic factor may be used for the cofactor which induces platelet agglutination in the presence of normal factor VfflR WF see, e.g., Leis et al., Ristocetin induced aggregation of canine platelets, Thromb. Res. 19 309 316, 1980 Brinkhous et al., Use of venom coagglutinin and lyophilized platelets in testing for platelet aggregating von Willebrand factor, Blood 55 517 520 1980 Johnson et al., Species specificity in von Willebrand factorsupported platelet agglutination, Annals NY Acad. Sci. 81 227 235, 1981 Forbes et al., Aggregation of human platelets by purified porcine and bovine antihaemophilic factor, Nature 241 149 150, 1973 . The respective contents of the documents cited in the preceding sentence are hereby incorporated by reference. Rather than combining with factor VnIR WF in plasma to effect agglutination, as do the other cofactors mentioned above, bovine and porcine antihemophilic factor combines with a plateletassociated constituent to cause agglutination. Accordingly, bovine and procine antihemophilic factor can be isolated and used as an agglutination inducing cofactor for platelets other than bovine or porcine in plasma which is not taken from cow or pig. The degree of agglutination, and the nature of the agglutination reaction, varies among the various cofactors. Ristocetin is the most frequently employed agglutinating agent, but has the disadvantage of initiating the precipitation of plasma proteins. Such precipitation can lead to incorrect results, in both the aggregometery and the tube agglutination methods. In addition, ristocetin does not induce agglutination of platelets in the presence of canine plasma and, even with the addition of high concentrations of albumin Rosborough et al., Measurement of canine von Willebrand factor using ristocetin and polybrene, J. Lab. Clin. Med. 96 47 56, 1980, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference , the agglutination reaction is very limited, rehdering differentiation between the two types of von Willebrand s disease impractical in the dog. The aggregometery method also has the disadvantages of being costly and requiring technically advanced equipment, thereby reducing the effectiveness and ease of performing the determination. In addition, platelet aggregometery, where results are based upon the degree of agglutination induced by the cofactor over a specific time, may be influenced by the presence of turbid plasma samples, rendering the test results unreliable. In method 2 mentioned above, the time required for macroscopic agglutination to occur in a test tube determines the time of initial formation of visible aggregates of platelets, the initial formation time being the key parameter of the test seeSarjie et al., Nature of von Willebrand factor A new assay and a specific inhibitor, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 71 2937 2941, 1974 Brinkhous et al., Assay of von Willebrand factor in vonWillebrand s disease and hemophilia Use of a macroscopic platelet aggregation test, Thromb. Res. 6 267 272, 1975 . Although method 2 is less time consuming and requires no expensive equipment, it is often difficult to determine the exact time that aggregates first become visible, making results based on the initial formation time less reliable. Also, ristocetin induced precipitation of plasma proteins may be mistaken for platelet aggregates. Although certain snake venoms overcome the problem of proteinprecipitation encountered with ristocetin, snake venoms cannot separate Type II von Willebrand individuals, who test as normal.Another drawback to the aggregometery and macroscopic tube methods is the requirements in both for relatively large quantities of platelets, plasma, and cofactor, making them expensive to perform. The determination of factor VIllR Ag by method 3 see, e.g., Zimmerman et al., Immunologic differentiation of classic hemophilia tfactor VIII deficiencyl and von Willebrand s disease, Jx Clin. Invest. 50 244 254, 1971 is used only in conjunction with one of the other two methods, since immunophoresis is timeconsuming, requires expensive equipment, and only quantitates the plasma level of factor VIlIR Ag, i.e., method 3 does not determine whether the antigen is functional. Accordingly, immunophoresis alone can only identify Type I von Willebrand patients.In order to differentiate between Type I and Type II von Willebrand s disease, therefore, it has been necessary to ascertain the agglutinating effects of ristocetin and snake venom, respectively, or both to test for agglutination with ristocetin and also to determine immunologically the levels of factor VIlIR Ag. Another important blood abnormality is Bernard Soulier syndrome. In human patients with Bernard Soulier syndrome, factor VIUR WF is generally normal but the blood platelets lack glycocalicin, a platelet membrane glycoprotein necessary to factor VIUR WF induced agglutination, and thus do not agglutinate normally. See Shulman dc Karpatkin, Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of human platelet membranes Diminished major antigen in Glanzmann s thrombasthenia and Bernard Soulier syndrome, J.Biol. Chem. 255 4320 4327 1980 . As with von Willebrand s disease, there is an unmet need for a way to screen blood samples for evidence of Bernard Soulier syndrome in a variety of situations, including in hospital emergency rooms and in blood banks.

Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. Moreover the following description relates specifically to analysis of blood plasma for factorVIIIR WF, but the diagnostic kit of our invention can readily be formulated for analysing other agglutination factors in plasma. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a perspective view of a diagnostic kit within the present invention. Figure 2 presents planar and transverse perspectives, respectively, of agglutination slides that can be used, in accordance with the present invention, as means for visualizing punctate platelet aggregates dispersed in a sample containing blood plasma. Figures 3 5 show various items that can be used a components of a diagnostic kit within the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The diagnostic kit of the present invention preferably contains lyophilized blood platelet, dilutions of normal plasma and, as cofactors, ristocetin and a derivative of snake venom e.g., from Bothrops jararaca .In addition, the kit can contain agglutination slides, patient plasma pipet tips, and a pipet bulb. As indicated above, the present invention provides a bioassay for factor VIIIR WF in human and animal plasma, which bioassay compares the degree of agglutination size and number of platelet aggregates for platelets mixed with test plasma and the agglutination cofactor s with the degree of agglutination of platelets mixed with normal plasma preferably, with various dilutions of pooled normal plasma and the same cofactor s . Reference has already been made to the use of tpooled normal blood plasma in the present invention. Plasma samples from several conspecific individuals, preferably six or more, are combined to produce pooled normal plasma. Since the composite characteristics of pooled normal plasma are less likely to reflect any biochemical idiosyncrasies of the individuals who contributed to the pooled sample, pooled normal plasma is preferred, over plasma from a single normal individual, as the control plasma normal plasma against which plasma to be tested for factor VIaR WF deficiency test plasma is compared in accordance with the present invention. Whether the control plasma used in the present invention is pooled normal or not, it may be desirable in specific instances to determine whether a control sample or a test sample contains antibodies against platelets mixed in that sample, as described in greater detail below, or against factor VER Ag itself. Although their presence is considered an unlikely possibility, anti platelet antibodies would increase, and anti factor VIIIR Ag antibodies decrease, the apparent level of factor VIlIR WF activity, producing a false positive and a false negative determination, respectively.One control against the presence of anti platelet antibodies would be to test for the formation of aggregates in the absence of any cofactor. The presence of anti factor VLIIR Ag antibodies could be detected by mixing test plasma with control plasma in a ratio of about 1 3 and then comparing agglutination activity of the resultant combined plasma sample against that of the test plasma and control plasma, respectively. If the activity level in the combined plasma sample is less than additive, relative to the constituent plasmas, the presence of anti factor VmR Ag antibodies can be inferred.Once detected, undesired antibodies could be eliminated by conventional techniques, such as column extraction. An important feature of the present invention is the direct observation, by ocular inspection, of finely divided, punctate aggregates of blood platelets that form in normal samples i.e., those derived from blood plasma displaying a normal complement of procoagulant, cellular clotting and platelet aggregating activities after an agglutination cofactor has been introduced thereto, and after the resulting agglutination reaction has proceeded substantially to completion.More specifically, the present invention entails a contemporaneous visual comparison, without the need for sophisticated spectrophotometric or other apparatus, between at least a one sample containing a known concentration of blood platelets, a known concentration of control normal blood plasma, and an agglutination cofactor and b another sample containing the same concentration of platelets, the same cofactor, and the same concentration of test plasma. It has been discovered that, by directly observing the sample or samples containing the test plasma ln a contemporaneous preferably side by side comparison with a control sample which comprises the same concentration of normal preferably, pooled normal plasma, one can readily detect a deficiency of factor VIIIR WF in the test plasma sample, following the present invention. A factor VUIR WF deficiency is evidenced, in accordance with the present invention, by a paucity and or a reduction in size, relative to the control samples, of punctate aggregates dispersed in the test plasma sample. Preferably, the above mentioned contemporaneous visual comparison involves a plurality of control samples representing a serial dilution for example, 10o 6, 50 , and 2 of the control plasma in a physiologic saline solution. Utilizing various dilutions of normal plasma in a set of control samples allows one to make a semimuantitative determination of the effective titer of factor V R WF in test plasma sample. Direct visual comparison, in accordance with the present invention, of the relative densities and size of aggregates in the test plasma sample and in the control samples of differing plasma concentrations, respectively, permits a matching of the test sample with the closest corresponding dilution of normal plasma. Thus, if the density and or size of aggregates in a test plasma sample is judged to approximate that of the 2SR6 4 1 dilution of normal plasma in saline, then the effective titer of factor VIIIR WF in the test plasma is estimated to be about 29q6 of normal plasma, following the present invention. It is also preferred that more than one agglutination cofactor be used in the present invention for the purpose of assessing the relative agglutinating capacity of test plasma samples versus control samples comprising various amounts of normal plasma. For example, separate comparisons are preferably conducted, in accordance with the present invention, using ristocetin and a derivative of snake venom, respectively, as the agglutinating cofactor. Test plasma from individuals suffering from Type I vonWillebrand s disease will show a decrease in agglutinating activity when either cofactor as used. In contrast, samples derived from plasma of individuals suffering from Type II von Willebrand s disease will show decreased ristocetin induced agglutination only, i.e., the level of snake venom induced agglutination will be comparatively normal. Although it has been understood in the art that ristocetin does not readily induce agglutination of platelets in canine plasma, it is nevertheless possible to exploit ristocetin induced agglutination in analyzing canine plasma in accordance with the present invention.More specifically, it has been discovered that agglutination of platelets in canine plasma can be effected, to an extent readily detectable with the present invention, using ristocetin in the presence of about 300 mg of albumin, preferably serum albumin bovine, human or canine , per ml with ristocetin. lessee concentrations of albumin do not prevent ristocetin induced protein precipitation, thereby introducing an error factor. Also, platelet agglutination is hindered at lesser albumin concentrations, introducing a second error factor. As previously indicated, the present invention employ ocular inspection and direct visual comparison in lieu of costly aggregometers or similar devices of the sort heretofore used in the art. It must be appreciated, however, that direct visualization of plasma samples in accordance with the present invention can be assisted by means for magnifying the apparent size of platelet aggregates, and for enhancing the contrast between aggregates and background, respectively, thereby making easier the comparison between test and control samples. The aforementioned comparison can also be aided by using reproductions of images that correspond to or simulate the normal densities and sizes of aggregates previously observed in standardized samples having differing concentrations of control plasma.For example, cards upon which have been printed dot patterns that simulate the respective aggregate densities and sizes in a serial dilution of pooled normal plasma can be advantageously included in a diagnostic kit within the present invention. Generally speaking, platelets used in the present invention can be mixed with plasma of any species, i.e., there need be no conspecificity between platelets and the plasma sample wherein the platelets are suspended. An exception to this principle obtains for samples comprising porcine plasma and for samples comprising bovine plasma, as well as other ruminants plasmas. As previously indicated, it is known that pig and cow plasma normally contains antihemophilic factor which does not cause agglutination of porcine and bovine platelets in vivo, but which, when added to preparations comprising platelets and plasma, respectively, from species neither porcine nor ruminant, acts like ristocetin or snake venom cofactor in causing agglutination.Thus, porcine or bovine antihemophilic factor can serve as agglutinating cofactor in the present invention when samples comprising platelets and plasma, respectively, from non ruminate, non porch species are employed. Conversely, when samples comprising porcine or a ruminant s plasma are assayed in accordance with the present invention, it is preferable that only porcine or ruminant platelets, and a cofactor other than porcine or bovine antihemophilic factor, be used. Additional understanding of the present invention can be gained by reference to Figures 1 5, which are offered by way of illustration only. In Figure 1, which shows a preferred configuration for a diagnostic kit within the present invention, ten agglutination slides 1 are included in a suitable container with a 15 ml injection bottle 2 containing Tris bufter saline solution 0.15 M at pH 7.4, comprising 0.02 sodium azide which is used for reconstituting the cofactor s , plasma and platelets two 3 ml dropper bottles 3 which contain either lyophilized snake venom 35 ug per ml or ristocetin 15 mg ml with 30bovine serum albumin three dropper bottles 4 , each containing predetermined amounts of lyophilized, pooled normal plasma an 8 ml dropper bottle 5 containing lyophilized canine platelets at 400,00p per ul ten dropper tips 6 for pipetting test plasma and a pipet bulb 7 . Figure 2 illustrates an agglutination slide which can comprise means for visualizing the punctate platelet aggregates that form in at least some of the plasma samples disposed in each of the slide s wells 8 when the diagnostic kit of the present invention is used. The agglutination slide consists of a wettable, plastic substrate 9 having a silver backing, or mirror surface, and a raised matte front l0 In the matte portion of the slide are provided six ovals wells 8 in which the agglutination reaction or lack thereof in each sample can be directly observed against the mirror surface. Figure 3 shows a 15 ml serum container 11 , with rubber stopper 12 and seal 13 , which can be used as the injection bottle 2 in the kit shown in Figure 1. Figure 4 illustrates the configuration of the dropper bottles mentioned above as components 3, 4 in the kit shown inFigure 1. The bottle 14 varies in size from 2 to 8 mls. The pipet tip 6 is standardized, however, so that equal volumes of each reagent can be supplied by mixing 1 drop at about 20 drops ml of the respective reagents in the separate wells of the agglutination slide. The cap 15 is designed to fit the bottle, i.e., to fit over the standardized tip. Figure 5 depicts the above mentioned standardized pipet tip 6 with a pipet bulb 7 used to fill the tip with test plasma, which can then be dispensed, one drop at a time, into the wells of the agglutination slide. In practicing the claimed invention, the reagents of the diagnostic kit are each reconstituted with the buffered saline solution, e.g., by adding to each dropper bottle an amount of saline, preferably prescribed on the bottle itself, to provide the necessary concentration and amount of the respective reagent. A citrated blood sample is obtained from the individual under study and the plasma is separated from blood cells by centrifugation at 1500 X g for 10 minutes. One drop of reconstituted platelet solution about 0.05 ml is then added to each well of the agglutination slide. To two wells, one drop of 10 control plasma is added. To two other wells, one drop of 5096 and 299b control plasma, respectively is added. To each of the remaining two wells, one drop of test plasma is added. The ristocetin cofactor is thereafter added to one of the 100 control samples, to one of the test plasma samples, and to each of the 5096 and 25 control plasma sample, respectively. To each of the remaining 10096 control and test plasma samples, the snake venom cofactor is added. All the samples are then mixed and layered out over the surface of the respective well, and gently rocked for about three minutes. The samples should be compared within five minutes after addition of the cofactor. The degree of agglutination to ristocetin cofactor is compared between the 100 , 51, and 25 control normal plasma samples and the first test sample to derive a semi quantitative determination of the amount of factor VIIIR WF in the test plasma, as explained above. Generally, a test plasma sample would be considered normal when it displayed factor VIIIR WF activity in excess of that observed for the 50 control sample. Then the relative degree of agglutination induced by the snake venom cofactor is ascertained by comparing the 10 1 control and second test plasma samples.This comparison provides a qualitative determination of whether the factor VIIIR Ag is functionally normal.Accordingly, for plasma samples from individuals suffering fromType II von Willebrand s disease, the value for factor VtnR WF activity in the second test samples with snake venom cofactor should be roughly equivalent to activity in the 10 1 control sample receiving the same cofactor. If a serial dilution series of control samples are used with snake venom cofactor, a semiquantitative determination can be made, in the manner described above, for the total amount of factor VER Ag functionally normal or otherwise which is present. The following examples are offered in order to illustrate the present invention more fully, but are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof.EXAMPLE 1Preparation of Platelets The source of platelets has been found to be of no moment in assaying plasma from human and canine patients in accordance with the present invention. Accordingly, canine platelets can be used in this kit, although platelets from other animal or human sources are also suitable. Formalin fixed, lyophilized human platelets which can be used in the present invention are marketed by Helena Laboratories Beaumont, Texas and by BiodataCorporation Hatboro, Pennsylvania . To prepare canine platelets for use in the present invention, blood samples were drawn from healthy dogs into scid citrate dextrose ACD , 1 part ACD to 9 parts blood. The citrated samples were centrifuged 2000 X g for 3 minutes at room temperature , or were separated by hemapheresis, to obtain platelet rich plasma PRP .To the PRP, 0.25 formalin was added in equal volume, and the mixture allowed to fix overnight at 4 C. The fixed PRP was thereafter centrifuged at 2000 X g for 15 minutes to obtain a fixed platelet pellet. The platelet pellet was washed resuspension followed by repeated centrifugation in 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 a total of four times. Two washings in 0.15 M Tri buffered saline at pH 7.4 then followed. Finally, the platelet pellet was washed twice in deionized water containing 0.01 sodium azide. After the final wash, the resuspended platelets were allowed to stand for one hour, and the supernatant was removed. The platelet count was adjusted to 400,000 platelets per ul. The sample was divided into the dropper bottles and lyophilized.Platelets prepared in this manner were found to be stable for over 12 months and for 30 days following reconstitution when stored at 40CEXAMPLE 2Preparation of Plasma Controls Blood samples drawn in ACD from healthy individuals of the same species were centrifuged at 2000 X g for 30 minutes at 40C to obtain platelet poor plasma. Alternatively, platelet poor plasma was obtained by hemapheresis. The plasma was then divided into dropper bottles 2 ml for the 100 control sample 1 ml for the S096 control sample and 0.5 ml for the 2D control sample and lyophilized. The lyophilized products were each later reconstituted with 2 ml of Tris buffered saline to produce the desired plasma dilutions.EXAMPLE 3Preparation of Cofactors The snake venom cofactor was prepared from Bothrops jararaca venom obtained from Sigma Chemical Company, St.Louis, Missouri . To separate venom agglutination cofactor from other venom constituents, including factors which display thrombinlike activity, see, e.g., Mitrakul, Effects of Green Pit Viper... venoms on blood coagulation, platelets and the fibrinolytic enzyme systems, Am. J. Chem. Pharm. 60 654 62 1973 , the snake venom was dissolved in 0.15 M saline containing 84 mM imidizole at pH 7.35 at a concentration of 5 mg ml and then dialyzed against buffer at 40C for 24 hours. The platelet agglutinating fraction was obtained by eluting the dialyzed venom through diethylaminoethyl cellulose resin ion exchange chromatography with 0.2 M saline containing 84 mM imidizole pH 7.35 . The eluted fraction was then dialyzed against deionized water for 24 hours at 4oC, diluted to 35 ug per ml, divided into dropper bottles 1.5 ml , and finally lyophilized. Ristocetin cofactor was made by weighing 37.5 mg of ristocetin and 750 mg of bovine serum albumin into a 3 ml dropper bottle. The contents of the dropper bottle reconstituted with 2.5 ml Tris buffered saline to achieve a working concentration of 15 mg ml ristocetin in 30 bovine serum albumin. At this concentration of albumin, ristocetin does not induce plasma protein precipitation, but still supports platelet agglutination in the presence of functional factor VUIR Ag. Other cofactors may be substituted for both ristocetin and snake venom cofactors in the present invention. As a source of snake venom from which a suitable snake venom cofactor can be derived, snakes of the family Crotalidae are preferred. AlthoughBothrops jararaca venom is particularly preferred, other venoms can be used in the present invention, including venoms of Bothrops alternatus, Bothrops neowiidis, Trimeresurus flavoviridis, A. rhodostoma, Bothrops atrox, Bothrops iararacussu, and Bothrops lansbergii. See U.S. Patent No. 4,287,087, the contents of which are hereby ineorporatred by reference. A purified snake venom cotactor is also manufactured commercially, under the product name BROTROCETIN, byPentapharm AG of Basel, Switzerland. Ristocetin cofactor can be obtained from Sigma Chemical Company St. Louis, Missouri . A diagnostic kit within the present invention may employ volumes of reagents of 10 ul and up. Other types of agglutination slides than that shown in Figure 1 can be used. Also, a cuvette, tube, microtiter plate, or similar device can comprise means for directly visualizing the plasma samples. The method of the present invention can be carried out at a temperature between about 40C to 50 C, although room temperature is preferred. Once reconstituted, the reagents may be stored from 700C to 400C, although higher temperatures tend to shorten the useful life of the reagents. Presh washed platelets, fixed platelets and cryopreserved platelet can be used, so long as ruminant or porcine platelets are employed when a ruminant or porcine plasma sample is analyzed.In place of natural platelets, artificial platelets can also be used in accordance with the present invention. By artificial platelets are meant beads or particles comprised of glass, latex, plastic or other material to which proteins, particlarly platelet membrane glycoproteins, can be coated and or surface bound. See,. g Inman, Covalent linkage of functional groups, ligands, and proteins to polyacrylaminde beads, 34B METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 30 W.B. Jakoby ed. 1974 , the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. For example, the platelet protein glycocalicin, or glycoprotein I, which is a required component of cofactor induced factor VIIIR WP activity, can be isolated, see Solum et al, Platelet glycocalicin Its membrane association and solubilization in aqueous media, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 597 235 246 1980 , and coated onto latex bead artificial platelets, which in turn can serve as agglutination substrates in the presence of ristocetin or some other cofactor, in the present invention.Alternatively, artificial platelets comprising latex or polyacrylamide beads can be coated with anti factor VIIlR Ag antibody, i.e., an antibody which crossreacts with factor VIIIR Ag. The artificial platelets, when suspended in a sample comprised of plasma containing the crossreactive antigen, support a cofactor induced agglutination which is visualized in accordance with the present invention. In addition to screening plasma samples for evidence of von Willebrand s disease, the present invention can be used to detect other blood component deficiencies, including Bernard Soulier syndrome. It has now been discovered that some horses also suffer a condition substantially similar to Bernard Soulier syndrome. Both human and equine plasma samples can be screened forBernard Soulier syndrome, in accordance with the present invention, by using a platelet rich plasma, prepared as described in Example 1 above, for the test plasma. If agglutination does not occur after sgglutination inducing cofactor is added to such platelet rich test plasma, then Bernard Soulier syndrome can be inferred when an additional test series, using platelet poor plasma, reconstituted platelets and cofactor as described above, shows normal factor VER WF activity, i.e., when von Willebrand s disease is ruled out as the cause for no agglutination in the platelet rich test plasma. These above described variations, and others, do not constitute a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as may be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art are intended to be included herein.
