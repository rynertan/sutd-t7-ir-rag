## Description
STRUCTURAL VESSELS AND METHODS OF FORMING SAME This invention relates generally to a structural vessel as well as to methods of forming same. ore par icularly, the vessel is double walled, is wound helically and has a helically wound stiffening spacer between its walls. Long cylindrical vessels of large diameter are known for use as platform supports for offshore oil drilling operations, and are normally fabricated from a plurality of cylindrical plate sections seamed welded along contiguous or overlapping edges between sections to form a single walled or a double walled vessel. Circular reinforcing ribs are needed as well as longitudinal ribbing, and sometimes spaced bulkheads are required to ensure structural integrity. The fabrication of especially such large and heavy vessels is, however, etrerely time consmin. and costly requiring numerous labor consuming steps during the welding and weld inspection operations. On the other hand, cylinder conceits, tubes and piping have been fabricated more quickly and less abçriously by helically winding sheets of material and sealing together contiguous edges or surfaces of each pavr of successive winding.Normally, however, such a helical seam pipe or tube is designed principly for use as a single walled cor duit for fluids pressurized or not , communication lines, and the like, requiring a relatively small diameter of sufficient shell strength without additional reinforcements. This invention provides a structural vessel, comprising an inner tubular liner and an outer tubular shell surrounding said liner in spaced relation, said liner and said shell comprising helically curved strips of material, continuous and helically curved spacer means between said liner and said shell, said spacer means spanning contiguous edges at successive turns of said liner and spanning contiguous edges at successive terns of said shell, and means seaming together said liner edges and seaming together said shell edges, said spacer means being secured to said strips via said seaming means. Such a vessel is relative easy to fabricate at substantially less cost and reduced labor than known structures, yet has improved strength characteristics permitting use of relatively thin shells. The spacer means may comprise structural beams utilized as stiffeners and secured to the spaced walls of the shell and liner via the seaming along said contiguous edges. More spec fically, the structural vessel may be fabricated by applying to the leading edge of the inner wall a first section of a longitudinally split stiffening rib which may be a honeycomb I beam before helically winding the inner wall, contiguous edges of each pair of successive turns being seamed, the remaining split section of the rib being welded to the first wound rib and the outer wall wound helically over and weldcd thereto as well as along contiguous edges. The invention also provides a method of forming a structural vessel, comprising the steps of floating a water buoyant housing on a body of water and providing a sealed opening in a side wall of said housing at approximately the water level helically winding at least one strip of material in said housing to form an elongated tubular vessel extending the wound vessel through said sealed opening while carrying out said winding step and supporting said wound vessel by floating same in the body of water. A ballast control of the housing is provided for adiusting the inclination thereof to any change in inclination of the formed vessel extending outside the housing. The invention also provides a double walled structure vessel of spaced helically wound strips with a helically wound spacer stiffener therebetween which presents another option to the aforedescribed design, while at the same time retaining a simplified fabricating approach which produces a vessel of large diameter havins.improved strength characteristics and structural integrity. Thus the invention may provide such a doublewalled structural vessel in which the liner and the shell are relatively shifted axially such that the shell edges are out of alignment with the liner edges, and including means such as welding for securing spacer means to the strips and the contiguous liner edges together as well as the contiguous shell edges together. A further feature is to provide such a doublewalled structural vessel in which the spacer means, which may comprise beam sections having flanges extending along the liner edges and along the shell edges, are likewise secured to the confronting surfaces of the strips between opposing edges thereof. A still further feature is to provide such a doublewalled structural vessel wherein one of the beam sections is secured to one of the edges of one of the strips before winding same to form the liner, and the other of contiguous edges at the successive turns cf the liner is secured to such one edge and to the one section, and the other of the beam sections is secured at one of the edges to the other strip before winding same to form the shell, and the other of the contiguous edges at the successive turns of the shell is secured to such one edge of the other strip and to such other beam section, and the ends of the beam sections opposite their flanges are secured to confrontinq surfaces of the strips. The following is a description of some specific embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevational view of a helically fored structural vessel according to the invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of the structural vessel in the process of being fabricated within a floating work housing Figures 3 and 4 are perspective views of a rib stiffener disused between the walls of the present vessel, and being fired from a structural I beam of honeycomb constructions Figure 5 is a side view of the structural vessel according to one embodiment of the invention in the process of fabricatior taker. substantially along the line 5 5 of Figure 2 Figure 6 is a typical section of the double walled integrally stiffened vessel according to the invention, taken sustantially along the line 6 6 of Figure 5 Figure 7 is a perspective view illustrating the technique useg in fabricating the structural vessel according to the nver.tion Figures 8, 9, 10 and 11 are sectional views showing the steps employed in fabricating the Figure 5 vessel, taken substantially along the line 8 8, 9 9, 10 10 and 11 11 of Figure 7 Figure 12, is a slightly enlarged detail view of a typical pair of support and drive rolls provided for the vessel during fabrication Figure 13 is an enlarged detail view of one of the several drive support rolls provided for rotating the structural vessel during fabrication Figure 14 is an enlarged detail view of a liquid seal between an opening in the work housing through which the formed structural vessel extends Figures 15 and 16 are respectively side and top views of the vessel during fabrication, the work housing being son in section Figure 17 is an end view of the completed vessel Figure 18 is a view showing the vessel of Figure 17 altered in shape to form a ship s hull of different widths. Figure 19 is a perspective view illustrating the technique used in fabricating the structural vessel according tc. another embodiment of the invention Figure 20 is a cross sectional view of the formed vessel taken substantially along the line 20 20 of Figure 19 Figure 21 is a cross sectional view of the inner liner with a spacer section secured thereto, taken substantially along the line 21 21 of Figure 19 and Figure 22 is a cross sectional view of the outer shell with a spacer section secured thereto, taken substantially along the line 22 22 of Figure 19. Turning now to the drawings wherein like reference characters refer to like and corresponding parts throughout the several views, a completed helical seam structural vessel is shown in Figure 1, generally designated 20, as having end caps 21 of, for example, conical shape, which may be secured in place in any conventional manner for closing the opposed ends of the formed vessel. The vessel is hollow and preferably cylindrical, although it may be of varying diameter without departing from the invention, and may thus be towed in a body of water by means of a tow line 22 hooked as at 23. Reference is now made to Figure 7 which illustrates the essential features used in fabricating the helical seam structural vessel according to one embodiment of the invention.An inner strip 24 of material, such as plate steel, is wound from a supply not shown in a helical manner about a series of forming rolls 25 to form an inner tubular liner. Appropriate tube forming means will be utilized for forming the helical turns from a continuous or laterally spliced strip. A first longitudinal half 26a of a rib stiffener produced from a structural I beam or double T beam 26 Figure 3 is welded along a leading edge 27 Figure 8 of the inner strip. First and second halves 26a and 26b are produced in a known manner by separating the webs of beams along undulating or trapezoidal lines 28 to form individual beam sections 26a and 26b, the pro jetting regions being oppositely disposed and subsequently welded together, in a manner to be hereinafter described, so as to produce a known honeycomb beam section of the type shown in Figure 4.Before the helical winding of inner strip 24, beam section 26a is welded as at 28 and or 28a Figure 8 along leading edge 27 of the strip, substantially one half of tne flange of section 26a extending outwardly of the edge as shown. This extended flange portion is lapped over a trailing edge 31 of the next adjacent formed helical turn Figure 9 , as at station 32, and a fillet weld 33 and or 33a is applied at such station for joining the contiguous leading and trailing edges of the turns together via beam section 26a. In the meantime, beam section 26b is wound over web section 26a in such a manner that projecting web regions are oppositely disposed to form a honeycomb beam structure of the type shown in Figure 4.These projecting web regions are subsequently welded together as at 34 Figures 6 and 10 at station 37 for completing the weld joint between the leading and trailing edges and for filing the gap therebetween. An Automatic UltrasonicInspection Station 30 of the inner strip major weld is located as shown in Fig. 7. An outer strip 38 of material, such as plate steel, is then helically wound, to form an outer tubular shell, over beam section 26b with its trailing edge 39 Figure 10 overlapping the flange of this section, whereafter a fillet weld 41 is applies at station 42. The leading edge 43 of the outer strip is then fillet welded as at 44 Figure 11 to the contiguous edge of the next adjacent turn via beam section 26b, at station 45, and a major weld 40 completes the welded seam and fills the gap between contiguous edges of the outer strip turns, at station 46. An Autoaatic Ultrasonic Inspection Station 30a of the outer strip major weld is disposed as in Fig. 7. A sandblast chamber 47 as well as a paint and drying chambor 48 are provided for carrying out the exterior finishing operations of the formed vessel. Support roller assemblies 49 Figures 5 and 7 are provided at opposite lower sides of the formed vessel and form a cradle support within work housing 51 Figure 2 , these roller assemblies being mounted on transverse box beams 52, or the like, support on a partition floor 53 Figure 15 provided within the work housing. Each support roller assembly 49, shown in more detail in Figures 12 and 13, comprises a pair of pneumatic wheels or tires 54 each containing an internal hydraulic drive motor unit 55 as including a hub 56. on which the wheel is mounted for rotation therewith1 and a hydraulic drive motor 57.The motor is stationary and is supplied via hydraulic lines 58 so that its output drives hub 56 which in turn rotates wheel 54. These drive motors are relief valved for establishing a synchronized speed between the drive rolls, and are suitably controlled for variation and reversability, if necessary. A support bracket 59 for the wheel pair, on which a wheel arm support 60 is attached, has flanges mating with flanges of an underlying bracket 61, with fasteners extending through elongated slots in one of the flanges for adjusting the wheels toward and away from the rotational axis of the formed vessel to adjust for any diameter variation of the wheels. And, spaced holes 62 along each box beam permit the roll support assembly to be adjusted to accommodate different sized vessel diameters. Pairs of support wheels of each assembly are typically located along the seamed edges of the outer helical turns Figure 7 fcr driving the vessel during fabrication in the direction of the major arrow thereof.Such a support and drive of the vessel allows for several anticipated minor irregularities, such as out of round, weld profiles, chording from the castellated beam reinforcing ribs as well as to transmit the expected loads without distortion of the outer shell. And, synchronized steering motors 63 may be provided for steering the wheels along the outer seams for positively maintaining the support and drive wheels 54 along the reinforcing ribs of the structure with precise forward feed for well gap control. Work housing 51 has an access opening 64 in a side wall thereof Figure 2 through which the inner and outer strips and the reinforcing ribs are introduced from their respective storage supplies for the fabrication of the structural vessel according to the invention. And, an end wall 65 of the housing has an opening 66 Figures 14 to 161 through which the fabricated end of the vessel progressively extends. A water lock in the form of a pneumatic seal is provided along at least the bottom half edge of this opening for sealing the interior of the housing against water entry.Such a seal may be in the form of a closed ended arcuate tube 67 of elastomeric material supplied with air under pressure from an air supply 68 and having a plurality of air openings 69 along the inner wall thereof through which air is emitted for creating both a pneumatic seal as well as an antifriction bearing. Along the upper half of the edge of opening 66 are provided a plurality of support and drive roller assemblies 49 similar in construction and operation to that described with refercnsc to Figure 12.Those rollers function to compensate for the nose down or nose up loado created during fabrication of the vessel depending on the extent of the vessel outwardly of the housings holding down the vessel against the housing seal should the housing and the vessel be ballasted out of synchronization, The work housing floats on a body of water Figure 2 which may be the same as that in which the formed vessel floats as it extends from the housing. And, as the formed vessel progessively extends outwardly of end walls 65, the housing will tend to incline slightly downward at this end.In order to avoid any damage to the pneumatic seal and or to the assemblies 49 surrounding the end wall opening, the housing is water ballast controlled by the provision of ballast tanks 71 Figures 15, 16 connected to a suitable compressed air supply through valuing for positively adjusting the inclination of the housing to conform to the vessel inclination. Openings 70 in the bottums of the tanks facilitate ballast control in a known manner. It should be pointed out that opening 66 can be varied to accommodate the fabrication of vessels of different diameters by provision of fish plates, or the like, at the opening on which the pneumatic seal and the roller 49 are mounted. A helical seamed, double walled structural vessel according to another embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 19, generally designated 80, in the process of being fabricated with a portion thereof, shown at the left in the Figure, having been completed. The vessel is hollow and preferably cylindrical, althcgh it may be of varying diameter, and may have conical end caps to facilitate easy towing in a body of water, similarly as described with reference to Fig. 2. As will be seen, the structural vessel according to this other embodiment of the invention is simi lar to the aforedescribed one embodiment of the vessel in that it comprises a helically wound inner liner surrounded in spaced relation by a helically wound outer shell with helically wound spacer means between the liner and shell secured thereto via means which also secures the contiguous liner edges together and which secures the contiguous shell edges together.Such spacer means, which is continuous and also functions as a stiffener, may for example be produced in a known manner from a structural I beam, double T bean., channel shaped beam or Z shaped beam by separating the beam web along an undulating or trapezoidal line to form individual bean sections 81 an 82 having castellated webs which facilitate bending while being helically wound. Otherwise, continuous bars of rectangular cross section capable of bending when helically wound, can be utilized without departing from the invention. In the process of fabricating the vessel, a continuous inner strip 83 of material, such as plate steel, is wound from a supply not shown in a helical manner about a series of forming rolls such as shown in Fig. 7, to thereby form an inner tubular liner. npropriate tube forming means will be utilized for forming the helical turns from a continuous or laterally spliced strip. Before winding, beam section 81 is fillet welded for example along a leading edge 84 of the inner strip with approximately one half its flange 81a extending outwardly of this edge. This extended flange portion is lapped over a trailing edge 85 of the next adjacent formed helical turn and a butt weld 86 is applied for joining the contiguous leading and trailing edges of the inner turns together via beam section 81. Beam section 82 may then be fillet welded along a trailing edge 87 of an outer strip 88 of material, such as plate steel, with substantially one half flange 82a of section 82 extending outwardly of this edge as shown. The outer strip is then helically wound about the inner strip and is maintained axially shifted relative thereto such that the edges of the outer strip are out of alignment with the edges of the inner strip, as shown in Figs. 19 and 20, whereby the web tips of beam section 81 confront the inner surface of strip 88, and the web tips of beam section 82 confront the outer surface of strip 83. In such manner, the web tips of the beam sections are respectively disposed between the opposing edges of the strips which confront them. And, a leading edge 89 of outer strip 88 overlaps the exposed portion of flange 82a on an already wound outer strip and is fillet welded to the trailing edge of that strip after which the seam at these edges is butt welded together as at 91 via beam section 82. The web tips of both beam sections are then fillet or fusion welded to the respective surfaces of the wound strips which they confront. Support roller assemblies are provided at opposite lower sides of the formed vessel and form a cradle support within a work housing, similarly as described with reference toFig. 5. And, such cradle support may be located within a work housing which is water bouyant and which has an opening in a side wall thereof through which the formed structural vessel progressively extends in the direction of the arrow of Fig. 19 during the fabrication process, all as described with reference to Fig. 5. Moreover, while the outer strip is being wound in place, concrete may be pumped into the space between the strips for structural purposes, weep holes being Drovided in the inner liner for known purposes. And, the inner liner may be covered with a thin concrete lining during the fabrication process to protect the steel vessel against corrosion when, for example, used as a water aqueduct. From the foregoing it can be seen that a double walled web stiffened structural vessel is capable of being produced according to the invention in a simple and uniform manner of practically any predetermined size, and enjoys a wide variety of uses. For example, vessel 20 can easily be converted from its cylindrical shape of Figure 17 into a ship s hull shown at 20 or 20t in Figure 18 by simply slitting through the double wall longitudinally along a line 72 parallel to the central axis of the vessel. Free ends 73 and 74 thus formed may then be moved apart a predetermined distance, as by jacking, and a flat deck 75 spanning ends 73 and 74 may be secured thereto so as to convert the vessel into a submersible or a partly submersible ship s hull having a predetermined beam width without the need for many of the usual structural bulkheads and or internal supports.The beam width can be varied significantly between hull 20 and 20 without substantially reducing the overall depth of the hull. During the conversion process, it should be pointed out that opposed ends 73 and 74 are spread apart while maintaining, in some conventional manner, a substantially spiral contour for the hull which may be utilized as a freighter, ore boat, super barge, liquid tanker. pressurized sea goinq vessel, or the like. And, the structure vessel according to the invention may be utilized as a storage tank, grain elevator, tunnel, transportation unit, support for an offshore drilling platform, etc.A minimal amount of welding is required to fabricate the present vessel since the continuous edges of the inner and outer strips may be seamed together via beam or rib 26, and position welding directed downwardly for the seaming of both inner and outer strips is more reliable and less time consuming. As the vessel progresses during fabrication, its dead weight is supported in a body of water requiring no external mechanical supports outside a floating housing thereby reducing the cost of fabrication and the need for replacement of friction bearings and supports externally of the floating work housing. And, vessel 80 is likewise capable of being converted into a ship s hull in a similar manner to that aforedescribed.Moreover, vessel 80 provides the advantage that, during the fabrication process according to the invention, the rarrow webs of the spacer ribs need not be tracked as in the first embodiment of the present design since the tips of these webs are now welded along confronting respective surfaces of the inner and outer strips.And, since during the winding of the ribs the web tips of the inner section slightly fan out and the web tips of the outer section slightly contract, care must be taken in properly cutting the beam web along an undulating line so that the tips of the castellated webs produced will match as closely as pcssible during the fabrication process. The present invention avoids these potential difficulties because the web tips between beam sections do not confront and need not match. Inherent in the type of vessel construction of the invention is an overall buckling strength sufficient to eliminate the need for intermediate bulkheads or deep frames. Also, the ability to use thinner plates provides superior physical and mechanical properties and is less limiting in construction capabilities. The fabrication process is unique in that it provides for a continuous, automated and integrated operation.Labor costs are reduced and required skills are minimal. Layout, cutting, shaping, welding and weld testing, blasting, and painting of metalizing occur sequentially. There is economy in the capitol expenditures since the requirement for costly items such as welding manipulators, ways and scaffolds, bending rolls and process for precision cutting, edge preparation equipment, and overhead cranes, are minimum or non existent.internal bulkheading and endcapping of the vessel is enhanced by the ability to roll the vessel to any position for fitting and welding. With the use of a body of water to support the completed portion of the vessel, the production facility is rendered portable and relatively inexpensive thereby leading to savings in freight on tunnel projects, supports, etc. Unsinkable monolithic hulls can be produced by filling the space between inner and outer walls with a high buoyancy, low water absorption, rigid, urethane foam. As each helical segment of the vessel is completed, the foam system components may be neutered, mixed, and dispensed as a liquid stream into the cavity, where they react and expand to fill the void. During expansion a permanent internal pressure is created as in a pneumatic tire additionally strengthening the vessel. Not only is the resultant vessel also reliably buoyant but the insulating efficiency of foam further increases the uses of the present vessel for the storage of, or operation in extreme cold or hot climates. For ultra compressive strength cnd or rigidity, various concrete formulations can be injected into the space between the walls using a similar technique.Further, by varying the density of the concrete mixture, the weight displacement ratio can be adjusted to meet design requirements in floating arrangements. Moreover, conventional hulls can be produced by axially splitting the vessel and moving its sides apart a distance up to sixty percent beyond its original diameter. Thus, a lightweight hull is quickly fabricated at minimum costs. Also, closed vessel 20 of the invention may be utilized for the transFort and or storage of both a liquid and a gas by the provision of a longitudinal flexible diaphragm separating the same, as generally disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,000,700. Obviously, many other modifications and variations of the present invention are made possible in the light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
