# Stencil duplicator providing automatic stencil perforation, charging, printing, and disposal.

## Abstract
The stencil duplicator includes a cylindrical porous rotary printing drum and a means for selectively rotating it in a preferred direction a means for clamping the leading edge of a stencil master along a generator of the printing drum a means for supplying printing ink to the inner surface of the printing drum a press roller means for pressing a paper sheet to the outer surface of the printing drum with a progressive rolling action a means for feeding a paper sheet between the printing drum and the press roller means a means for making a stencil master, including a light transmitting plate, a light source which selectively illuminates the light transmitting plate, and a pressure plate facing the light transmitting plate, with the light transmitting plate and the pressure plate being selectively able either to be separated or pressed together a means for feeding the leading edge of a stencil master which has passed between the light transmitting plate and the pressure plate towards the clamping means so that it may be clamped thereby and means for controlling operation so that, when the light transmitting plate and the pressure plate are separated from one another with a stencil master interposed therebe tween, the printing drum is rotated and by pulling via the clamping means on the leading edge of the stencil master withdraws it and wraps it around the printing drum.
