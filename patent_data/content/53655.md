# Velocity indication apparatus and magnetic recording apparatus including same.

## Abstract
The velocity of a magnetic record card 12 is derived by recording a magnetic transition in a flux field in a stripe 16 with a write head 17 . The transition is later sensed, as the card is moved past the head, by an inductive read head 24 and a side by side magneto resistive read head 26 . The difference in outputs of the read heads is combined in a computation circuit 21 to give a voltage which is indicative of velocity on line 38 to a voltage controlled oscillator 20 . The oscillator 20 operates a flip flop 40 alternately to provide time base signals on line 41 to write head driver 44 and on line 42 to gate binary data from a register 45 to the write head driver 44 .
