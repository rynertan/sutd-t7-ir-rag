# Flow cytometry apparatus with uniform incoherent light excitation.

## Abstract
A flow cytometry apparatus for determining one or more characteristics of particles or the like flowing in a liquid stream includes a nozzle for generating a liquid flow stream for moving particles therethrough substantially one at a time. An arc lamp provides a beam of incoherent light to illuminate the particles moving in the flow stream. A prism in the light beam modifies non uniform incoherent light, as provided by said arc lamp, to a more uniform beam of illumination which is directed to the flowing particles. A detector is included for detecting light with respect to each moving particle and for associating the detected light with one or more character istics of the particles.
