# Gas valve.

## Abstract
A gas valve comprising a valve assembly has a rigid valve plate 23 with an opening 24 therein for receiving a stem member 25 of the valve actuator 15 . A resilient valve member 31 is mounted on the rigid valve plate 23 by having a peripheral portion 32 overlapping the valve plate 23 . To prevent high pressure gas from entering the opening 24 around the valve stem member 25 through the valve plate 23 to distort the resilient valve member 31 , a solid backup member 33 is mounted inside the resilient valve member 31 adjacent the rigid valve plate 23 .
