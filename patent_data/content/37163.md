# Flavouring agents, smoking compositions, combustible articles and foodstuffs containing such agents, and a method of producing the same.

## Abstract
Heterocyclic hydroxy substituted carboxylate compounds of the formula CHEM wherein X is a heterocyclic substituent containing from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, and any heteroatom in X is selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur prefered heterocyclic X substituents are selectedfrom pyrazyl and pyridyl radical . R is a substituent selected from aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic groups containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, R 1 and R 2 are hydrogen or substituents selected from aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic groups containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and R 1 and R 2 when taken together with connecting elements form an alicyclic structure, and R 3 is a substituent selected from aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic groups containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, are useful as flavouring agents in tobacco or other smoking compositions, combustible articles such as candles or solid fuel, and foodstuffs. Meat can be flavoured by smoking with the gasiform effluent from a fuel containing the agents.
