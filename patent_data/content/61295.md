# Process for preparing low silicate detergent compositions.

## Abstract
The structure and hence the powder properties of spray dried detergent powders are improved by the incor poration of a small amount of a succinate salt. In particular the invention is applicable to powders which are low in inherent structurants, especially to powders low in sodium silicate and in phosphate builder salts. Buccinic acid partially neutralised with sodium hydroxide is especially effective as a structuring aid.
