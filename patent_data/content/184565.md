# An arrangement for distributing and diluting a powdered coal air mixture.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an arrangement for transporting disintegrated solid particles, in which the particles 18 are transported by means of a quantity of air placed under an overpressure 14 . The weight ratio of the particle air mixture lies within the range at which particle transportation 11 gives rise to migrating particle agglomerations. Transporta tion of the particles is terminated in a particle agglomeration equalizing means 7,10 , from where the particles are transported further in the form of a particle air mixture equalized in time. Particle transportation is effected by at least two stages, a first stage 11 in which the weight ratio of the particle air mixture is greater than fifteen, and a second stage 6 in which the weight ratio of the particle air concentration is greater than five and lower than the weight ratio of the particle air mixture in the second stage. The arrangement can be used as a means for transport ing powdered coal to a powdered coal burner 1 connected to a combustion furnace 2 , in which arrangement pow dered coal is transported through conduits 11,6 by a quantity of air placed under an overpressure.
