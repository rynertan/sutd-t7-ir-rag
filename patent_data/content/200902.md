## Description
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical preparation encapsulating a mixture comprising drug and drug carrier capable of controlling the gastrointestinal transit of the pharmaceutical preparation and capable of controlling the release rate of drug from the dosage form, and to dosage forms comprising the same. More particularly, it relates to a pharmaceutical preparation encapsulating a mixture comprising drug and drug carrier, which comprises aqueous polymer and oil, capable of controlling the rate of transit of the pharmaceutical preparation in the gastrointestinal tract and capable of controlling the release of drug from the pharmaceutical preparation, and to the pharmaceutical preparations comprising the same. The convenience of sustained release preparations which maintain the blood concentration of the drug at desired level over a prolonged period of time has been recognized, and as such sustained release preparations, slow release matrix type tablet in which active ingredients are imbedded in insoluble matrix e.g., paraffin wax and polymeric resin and slow release granules in which active ingredients are coated with the polymeric film for diffusion control of active ingredients have been well known in the pharmaceutical art. In case of the application of abovementioned pharmaceutical preparations, however, we often encounter the unsatisfactory absorption of drug from the pharmaceutical preparation into the blood stream. In particular, when these types of pharmaceutical preparations are applied to the drug having the relatively short absorption site of the gastrointestinal lumen, unsatisfactory absorption extensively occurs. The main reason for such unsatisfactory absorption is that the passage of ordinary used sustained release preparations along the drug absorption site is relatively fast. From the viewpoint of this fast passage, hereinafter we call ordinary used dosage form as old dosage form . Recently, the technique for the estimation of the gastrointestinal transit rate of dosage form, i.e. technique of γ scintigraphy, has been spreadly used. S.S. Davis et al. Int. J. Pharmaceutics, The gastro duodenal transit time and the small intestinal transit time of the matrix tablet are 164 min. S.E. 92 min. and 188 min. S.E. 23 min. , respectively. In case of granules, the former transit time is 79 min. S.E. 20 min. as half time and the latter transit time is 227 min. S.E. 82 min. as half time, respectively. If the absorption site of drug exists among duodenum to ileum, we must design the slow release preparation from which one hundred percent of drug is released during about 360 min. If it is not so, the unsatisfactory absorption will be occurred. In order to overcome the unsatisfactory absorption of old dosage form, the attempts to extend retaining the dosage form for a prolonged period time in stomach were carried out by several investigators. For example, floating dosage forms in stomach are described in FR A 2512676, US Patents Nos. 4126672 and 4167558. The principle of such a floating system is that the density of floating system is lower than that of gastric fluid. Therefore, such a floating system owes to the existence of fluid in stomach. Unfortunately, it is known that the passage of water administered in the fasting state through pylorus is relatively fast, i.e., A. Hurwitz Gastroenterology, Moreover, in the fasting state the interdigestive migrating contractions IMC occurs at periodic interval of about 100 minutes. This IMC may let the floating system push out from the stomach. Consequently, the reliability of the floating system must be poor. The inventors of the present invention have discovered drug carrier comprising the aqueous polymer and oil could control the gastrointestinal transit rate and the drug release, and could overcome the disadvantages of old dosage forms. Therefore, the present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical preparation encapsulating a mixture comprising said aqueous polymer and liquid oil being present in a weight ratio of aqueous polymer to liquid oil of 2 1 to 1 40 and said drug being present in a weight ratio of drug to drug carrier of 3 2 to 1 400. Furthermore, the present invention is directed to the process for preparing the above pharmaceutical preparation comprising drug and drug carrier which comprises encapsulating the mixture comprising drug and drug carrier. The present invention is explained in more detail in the following. Suitable aqueous polymer to be used in drug carrier of the present invention includes polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose derivatives e.g., hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose , dextran, gelatin, pectin, sodium poly acrylic acid , carboxypolymethylene Carbopol , poly L lysin, pullulan, sodium alginate, chitosan, gums e.g., acacia, gum tragacanth, xanthan gum, guar gum, karaya gum . Suitable oil to be used in drug carrier of the present invention includes fats and fatty oils such as vegetable fat and oil e.g., arachis oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil , animal oil and fat e.g., lard, beef tallow , medium chain monoglyceride, medium chain diglyceride, medium chain triglyceride, hydrocarbon such as liquid paraffin, squalene, squalane fatty acid such as oleic acid, linoleic acid polyhydric alcohol such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerin , The ratio of aqueous polymer to oil by weight in our drug carrier can be suitably selected according to a kind of aqueous polymer and oil, degree of controlling the transit of the pharmaceutical preparation, and the ratio of aqueous polymer to oil by weight is 2 1 to 1 40 preferably 3 2 to 1 30, more preferably 1 1 to 1 20 . The ratio of drug to our drug carrier by weight in the pharmaceutical preparation can be suitably selected according to a kind of our drug carrier and drug, degree of controlling the transit of the pharmaceutical preparation, and the ratio of drug to our drug carrier by weight is 3 2 to 1 400 preferably 1 1 to 1 300, more preferably 1 3 to 1 200 . The present invention is explained according to the following Examples. The capsules in Table 1 were obtained by mixing poly ethylene oxide average MW 5,000,000 prepared by Aldrich Chemical Company Inc., hereinafter referred to as PEO , Miglyol 812 Trademark prepared by Dynamit Nobel Chemicals, hereinafter referred to as M812 and FK 027 and encapsulating them. The capsules in Table 2 were obtained by mixing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 2208 Japan Pharmacopoeia, tenth edition hereinafter referred to as HPMC , M812 and FK 027, and encapsulating them. CEX 160 mg was suspended in 5 W V hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 2910 Japan Pharmacopoeia, tenth edition i.e., aqueous TC 5R Trademark prepared by Shinetsu Chemical Co. solution 700 ml and the suspension was air sprayed on Non Pareil 350 500 µm 80 g Trademark prepared by Freund Co. by using Flow Coater Mini Trademark manufactured by Freund Co. to give particles containing CEX. The average diameter and CEX content of the obtained particles were 650 µm and 55.54 W W , respectively. At the next step, the particles 70 g obtained above were coated with the solution for enteric film, which was composed of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate HP 50 17.85 g Trademark prepared by Shinetsu Chemical Co. , cetyl alcohol 3.15 g , ethanol 110 ml and methylene chloride 110 ml , by using Flow Coater Mini to give enteric particles containing CEX hereinafter referred to as CEXep . The average diameter and CEX content of CEXep were 750 µm and 43.22 W W , respectively. The capsules in Table 3 were obtained by mixing CEXep, PEO and M812, and encapsulating them. To show the usefulness of drug carrier and the pharmaceutical preparations of this invention, the test results are explained as follows. The test samples A to C in Table 4 were prepared by mixing FK 027, PEO, M812 and Indigocarmine hereinafter referred to as IC , and a 3,54 g 1 8 OZ capsule prepared by Chemical Pharmaceutical Company Inc., was used as capsule. Each test sample together with water 40 ml was orally administered to overnight fasting male beagle dogs 8 12 kg and the dogs were left in the cage. The dogs were anesthetized by an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital 30 mg kg at 3, 6 or 9 hours after administration and the inside of the stomach of each dog in left prone position was observed by the endoscope. This test was carried out five times per each test sample. Furthermore, the same test for non disintegrating matrix tablet 10 mm x 5 mm instead of test samples was carried out two times as control experiments. The test result shows that the gastro duodenal transit times of the test samples A to C are significantly longer than that of non disintegrating matrix tablet and the gastro duodenal transit time of the test samples depends on the concentration of PEO. In the view point of endoscopic observation, our drug carrier visualized by IC was widely spread and adhered on the surface of stomach. The test samples D to H in Tables 6 and 7 were prepared by mixing FK 027, PEO or HPMC and M812. Dissolution test was carried out according to the method 2 in 10th edition of Japan Pharmacopoeia paddle method, 100 rpm, 900 ml artificial gastric juice at 37 C . Test samples were poured into the dissolution vessel as ten droplets from a plastic syringe. The dissolution profiles of test samples are given in the following table 8 . These results indicate that the increase of the amount of aqueous polymer in drug carrier make retard the rate of drug release. The test samples I to O in Tables 9 and 10 were prepared by mixing FK 027, PEO or HPMC and M812. The samples with 1 ml of M812, and 0.4 ml of M812 were encapsulated into a 3,54 g 1 8 OZ capsule, and a 0,405 g 1 70 OZ capsule respectively. Hereinafter, we refer this type of new dosage form N.D.F. in which the drug is included as non treated mere powder to as N.D.F. type 1. The tablets having three different release rates contained 125 mg potency of FK 027 were prepared as the representative of O.D.F. according to the usual procedure. Dissolution rates from O.D.F. of FK 027 were determined by the method described in 10th edition of Japan Pharmacopoeia paddle method, 100 rpm, 900 ml artificial gastric juice at 37 C . The obtained data were shown in the following table 11 . Each test sample was orally administered to six beagle dogs male, 8 12 kg which had been withheld from any food overnight. 20 ml of FK 027 Phosphate buffered solution 250 mg or 125 mg potency was administered as control of each beagle dog. Immediately after the administration of each sample, 40 ml of water 20 ml in case of control solution was administered. The assay for serum concentration of FK 027 was made by high performance liquid chromatographic method HPLC method . The results of FK 027 serum concentration from N.D.F. and O.D.F. were given in Tables 12 and 13 . It can be seen from the comparison of the results of N.D.F. with those of O.D.F. that N.D.F. in, particularly, the case of larger amounts of polymer gives the prolonged and higher level of serum concentration, namely, at least the peak concentration at 10 hours was obtained. On the other hand, three O.D.F. give the decrease of serum concentration after the point of 6 hours. From these results, the advantage of N.D.F. to O.D.F. is indicated clearly, which derives from more prolonged retaining in stomach of N.D.F. than O.D.F.. The estimation of N.D.F. for the absorption profiles from each dosage form into blood stream was carried out by using well known Wagner Nelson s equation J. wagner and E. Nelson, J. Pharm. Sci., The obtained cumulative amounts into blood stream of each sample are given in Table 14 . The results show that the absorption rate into blood stream from N.D.F. can be controlled by the amounts of polymer suspended in drug carrier. This controlling ability for absorption of N.D.F. is due to the controlling ability of drug release from drug carrier as described in Test II Drug release test . The duration of absorption from N.D.F. is estimated as about more than 10 hours. On the other hand, the obtained values of O.D.F. show the limited duration of absorption of about 6 hours in all three cases. The reason of these limited duration is that O.D.F. fastly passages out the absorption site while the drug release from O.D.F. is still maintaining. Test sample K described in Test III was used as the representative of N.D.F.. Test sample slow release O.D.F. FK 027 described in Test III was used as the representative of O.D.F.. Food 100 g was provided for three dogs at 30 minutes before the administration of test sample. After the administration of each sample, water 40 ml was administered immediately. The test results are given in Table 15 . The results of O.D.F. show the large discrepancy between the serum concentration of FK 027 at fasting and that after meal over the point of 6 hours and also show the decrease of AUC. This large discrepancy between at fasting and after meal may be due to the difference of overall gastrointestinal transit time of O.D.F. between them. In case of N.D.F., the difference between them was apparently small as a whole, and the test results show the almost same AUC. These results show that N.D.F. prepared with the drug carrier of the present invention is much less influenced by meal than O.D.F.. If the solubility of the subject drug in gastric juice is relatively high, the drug release rate from the abovementioned N.D.F. type 1 will be relatively faster than the retaining of drug carrier in stomach. Accordingly, in this case, we might lose the use of the advantage of the drug carrier. The following N.D.F. type 2 should be preferably applied in such a case. We describe N.D.F. type 2 using CEX as a pertinent drug. Capsule 8 in Table 3 was used as Test sample P A 3,54 g 1 8 OZ capsule was used . To compare N.D.F. type 2 with O.D.F., two O.D.F. of CEX were prepared. The preparation procedure of O.D.F. of CEX was carried out according to the usual one. The release rates of CEX from the obtained O.D.F. are given in the Table 16 . The method for the dissolution test is the same as that of Test III . These samples sample P, fast release O.D.F. CEX and slow release O.D.F. CEX were administered to the same 6 overnight fasting beagle dogs. The determination of CEX serum concentration was carried out by using HPLC method. The results are shown in Table 17 . The results of sample P show the prolonged absorption of CEX into blood stream. Two O.D.F. of CEX, however, show the decrease of CEX serum concentration after the point of 4 hours, and also the decrease of AUC. By Wagner Nelson s analysis Table 18 , the duration of absorption of sample P, fast release O.D.F. CEX and slow release O.D.F. CEX were obtained as 10 hr, ca. 6 hr and ca. 6hr, respectively. It is found that the N.D.F. type 2 is superior to O.D.F. from abovementioned results. N.D.F. type 2 is, of cource, not restricted to the above described dosage form. Not only enteric coated drug particle but also film e.g., ethylcellulose coated slow release particle can be preferably used. FK 235 8.5 g and TC 5R 25.5 g were dissolved in a 1 1 mixture 850 ml of ethanol and methylene chloride. Low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose L HPC Further, the suspension of L HPC At the next step, the particles 70 g containing FK 235 solid dispersion obtained above were coated with the solution for enteric film, which was composed of HP 50 14.4 g , cetyl alcohol 1.6 g , ethanol 160 ml and methylene Chloride 160 ml , by using Flow Coater Mini to give enteric particles. hereinafter referred to as FK 235ep . The average diameter and FK 235 content of FK 235ep were 750 µm and 7.2 w w , respectively. The capsule in Table 19 was obtained by mixing FK 235ep, PEO and M812, and encapsulating them. In order to elucidate the application of our drug carrier to hardly soluble Drugs, we prepared N.D.F. type 2 using FK 235 of which solubility in water is less than 2 µg ml, and tested. Capsule 9 in Table 19 was used as Test Sample Q A 3,54 g 1 8 OZ capsule was used . The plain tablet of FK 235 solid dispersion form FK 235, 4 mg potency prepared according to the usual procedure, and the capsule containing 111.1 mg of FK 235ep FK 235, 8 mg potency were used as O.D.F., and hereinafter referred to as reference 1 and reference 2 , respectively. Each test sample containing 8 mg potency of FK 235 was orally administered to six overnight fasting beagle dogs male, 8 12 kg . Immediately after the administration of each sample, water 40 ml was administered. The assay for plasma concentration of FK 235 was made by using ECD gas chromatographic procedure. The results are shown in Table 20 . The results of sample Q show the prolonged absorption of FK 235 into blood stream. On the other hand, References 1 and 2 show the decrease of FK 235 plasma concentration after the point of 2 hours. The preparation of other insoluble drug, FR 58664 was prepared in accordance with the similar method as that of the sample Q in test VI and studied. In the case of FR 58664 N.D.F., satisfactory results were obtained. These results indicate that our drug carrier can be applied to hardly soluble Drugs as FK 235 and FR 58664.
