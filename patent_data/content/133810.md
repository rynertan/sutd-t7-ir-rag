# INK JET PRINTER AND METHOD OF START UP AND SHUTDOWN THEREOF

## Abstract
An ink jet printer includes a print head 10 for producing at least one jet drop stream 12 from a fluid filament emerging therefrom, and a charge electrode arrangement 26, 28 for inducing electrical changes on drops formed from the fluid filament. The charge electrode arrangement is movable into and out of an operating position in which it is adjacent and at least partially surrounds the fluid filament. A deflection field is established prior to start up in which the field has a non zero electrical potential in the region of the fluid filament. At start up and shutdown of the printer, the charge electrode arrangement 26, 28 is retracted from its normal operating position and drops are charged by the deflection field. As a consequence, the charge electrodes 28 are not contaminated by ink from the unstable jets. The drops in the jet drop streams are, however. charged and deflected to a catcher 33 by the deflection field. After stable operation is obtained, the charge electrode arrangement is moved into its normal operating position. At shutdown of the printer, this sequence of steps is reversed.
