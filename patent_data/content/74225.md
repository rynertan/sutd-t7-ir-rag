# Radiometer.

## Abstract
A hand held battery powered instrument for the deter mination and recording of the intensity of radiation emitted or reflected by a target in the field in spectral bands from 400 nm to 12 micrometres. Two fields of view, typically 20 and 1 , are provided. The pointing accuracy is 0.1 or better. Multiple detectors are controlled by a single shutter. Gain and zero controls are preset, the whole spectral band is sampled in 4 seconds, and the results stored. They are later called up and shown on a liquid crystal display digitised to 9999.
