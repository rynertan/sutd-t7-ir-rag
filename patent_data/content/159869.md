## Description
Ceramic Composition forDielectric in Multilayer Capacitors The present invention is related to ceramic compositions having a high dielectric constant and high insulation resistance at temperatures up to 850C and which are capable of being formed by sintering a mixture of oxides at relatively low temperatures in the range of about 900 to 10500C. More particularly, the present invention is directed to ceramic compositions particularly suited for use as the dielectric in multilayer ceramic capacitors. Ceramic compositions using barium titanate have been used successfully as the dielectric materials for ceramic capacitors however, such compositions require relatively high sintering temperatures e.g. 1200C and higher, and this precludes the use of relatively inexpensive metal, such as silver and nickel, as capacitor electrodes, and mandates the use of higher melting, expensive precious metals, such as platinum. Recently, lead oxide based perovskite dielectric systems have been proposed to achieve low sintering temperatures while providing a relatively high dielectric constant and insulation resistance, for example, U.S. PatentNo.4,216,102 to Furukawa et al. Such prior art lead oxidebased solid solution systems provide significant advantages, however, there remains the need to provide high dielectric constants wi increased temperature dependence stability and higher insulation resistance at high temperatures, more comparable to barium titanate base dielectrics. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a ceramic composition which can be sintered at relatively low temperatures and which is characterised by improved dielectric constant and insulation resistance at temperatures up to 850C. Other objects will be apparent from the following description and claims taken in conjunction with the drawings wherein Figure 1 shows a photomicrograph original magnification 570X of the microstructure of a multilayer capacitor having a dielectric of sintered ceramic material in accordance with the present invention. Figures 2a, b and c are graphs showing the dielectric constant and insulation resistance values obtained from various ceramic compositions. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the s tarting lead oxide compositions and the final compositions of dielectrics of this invention. Figure 4 is a graph showing insulation resistance as a function of temperature for various lead oxide based dielectric materials, and Figure 5 is a graph showing temperature dependence characteristics of the lead oxide based dielectric of the present invention. A ceramic composition in accordance with the present invention is characterised by being sinterable at temperatures in the range of 900 to 10500C and having a dielectric constant K of at least 10,000 at 250C and 10,000 22 to 56 over the range of 10 85 0C and insulation resistance of at least 1012 ohm cm at 250C and 1011 ohm cm at 850C. These characteristics satisfy EIA standard RS 198 C for Z5U capacitors. The lead oxide base sintered ceramic dielectric composition of the present invention, on an oxide basis, consists essentially, of, by weight, 2.49 to 6.67 Fe203 24.18 to 28.14 Nb205 2.09 to 3.59 MgO 0.025 to 0.10 Mn02 0.20 to 1.508 in the aggregate of one or more of the following oxides GeO2, Si02, Bi203, CdO, ZnO, A1203, CuO and B203, chemically combined with at least 20 by weight ofPbO, to form a sintering aid having a melting point of not higher than 7750C and a resistivity at 250C of at least 1013 ohn cm, said dielectric composition having a total lead oxide content, as PbO, of from 64.32 to 66.20 and having an atomic ratio of Pb to the sum of Nb, Fe and Mg from 0.893 to 0.913 and a weight ratio of MgO to Fe203 from 0.34 to 1.3. The above defined composition provides low sintering ceramic 900 to 10500C having an optimum combination of dielectric constant and insulation resistance characteristics. The relatively low PbO content is particularly 5 ortant to the achievement of high dielectric constant as are the relationships recited with respect toPb, Fe, Mg and Nb. The relatively minor amounts of MnO2 and of the sintering aid additives enables optimum densification of the dielectric, and enhance the insulation resistance, especially at high temperatures e.g. 850C . Further, these additives in combination result in the insulation resistance remaining high during capacitor life testing under high temperature and voltage stresses. In the practice of the present invention, a blended mixture of finely divided particles of PbO, MgO, Fe203 andNb205 is provided in appropriate proportions and manganese, e.g. in the form of a manganese containing salt such as manganous nitrate or acetate, is added to provide the desired MnO2 content in the sintered ceramic, and the mixture is calcined at about 720 to 7800C for about 60 to 180 minutes in an air atmosphere. The resulting calcine material is milled to a size of about 0.6 micron and blended with finely divided e.g. 1 micron oxide sintering aid additive, in the amount of about 1 396 by weight of the calcine.Suitable sintering aid materials include Pb5Ge195Si105011, melting point 7200C, resistivity 1013 Ohn cm and lead containing glasses such as compositions A and B in Table A, below.

SOOOC 7000C Resistivity 1013 ohm cm 1013 ohm cm The mixture thus obtained is sintered at 900 to 10500C for about 60 to 180 minutes in the course of which the calcine and the sintering aid constituents react to provide a reaction product characterised by a microstructure comprising a predominantly lead perovskite solid solution phase surrounding discrete regions of sintering aid metal oxide residues.A representative microstructure original magnification 570X is shown inFigure 1 wherein 1 indicates generally the dielectric composition of the invention, and 2 is a capacitor electrode typically made of silver containing 5 to 25 wt. palladium. The lead containing perovskite phase of the dielectric composition is indicated at 3. The dark regions 4 surrounded by the perovskite dielectric phase 3 are sintering aid metal oxide residues, SiO2 and GeO2. Ceramic dielectric material in accordance with the present invention is used as the dielectric for multilayer ceramic capacitors following conventional practice and using relatively inexpensive metals such as silver and its alloys as the electrode material. The following example will further illustrate the present invention Example A calcine material was prepared from the following PbO sized 4.5 micron mean particle MgCO3 sized 3 micron size as determinedFe203 sized 0.5 micron by the SedigraphTMNb203 sized 3 micron technique. The materials were milled, dried and calcined at 7500C, for 120 minutes. In some instances, Mn N03 2 was added to the mixture before calcining to provide a desired Mn02 content in the calcine and, in further instances, oxidic sintering aid material was added after calcining to provide a desired sintering aid content. Materials as above described were sintered at 965 to 10500C. for about 120 minutes to obtain a dense ceramic, and conventional practices to make multilayer ceramic capacitors were followed. The multi layer capacitors had individual dielectric layers of about 1.2 mils thickness and a total capacitance of about 1 microfarad for a dielectric constant of 10,000 . The fired dielectric compositions are shown in Table 1 and the dielectric properties are listed in Table II.The data from Table II are plotted in Figures 2a, b and c and Figure 4. Samples A H, not in accordance with the present invention, reflect the known behaviour of lead magnesium iron niobate as described in U.S. 4,216,102 and elsewhere in the prior art. That is, as the PbO content approaches the stoichiometric value of about 68.25 wt. for 0.35 Pb Fe1 2Nb1 2 O3.0.65 Pb Mg1 3Nb2 3 O3. the dielectric constant and the insulation resistance of the material both increase sharply Samples A H as shown inFigures 2 a c and Table II . Sample I was made generally in accord with the present invention, but with an incorrect ratio of Pb Nb Mg Fe. The presence of MnO2 compare series E H with A D increases the insulation resistance of the composition when the PbO content is near its stoichiometric value.In sharp contrast, the compositions of this invention Samples J, K, L exhibit a high dielectric constant and very high insulation resistance at a significantly substoichiometric PbO content, at which other formulations exhibit low dielectric constants and very low insulation resistances, particularly at high temperatures, as can be seen inFigures 2 c and Figure 4. Figure 4 is a graph showing insulation resistance as a function of temperature for the materials of the example. As can be seen, the materials J, K, L in accordance with the present invention are superior. Figure 5 is a graph showing dielectric constant change with temperature for materials in accordance with the present invention. As can be seen, the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant is very good and well within the specification for Z5U type capacitors as established byElectric Industries Association Standard RS 198 C November 1983 . A significant aspect of the formulations of this invention is the manner in which they can be sintered.The usual practice is to sinter PbO containing perovskites in closed crucibles often with lead containing atmosphere powders near the bodies to minimize lead loss. In the practice of the present invention sintering can be accomplished in open containers such as those used to make barium titanate multilayer capacitors, using an excess of PbO. PbO loss from the dielectric during sintering results in the achievement of the desired PbO content.Figure 3 shows the PbO content for the presintered mixture and sintered compositions for samples J, K, L of the present invention. A relatively wide range of initial high PbO contents results in a narrow range of final composition in accordance with the present invention. It is usually desirable, however, to use starting compositions which are relatively low in PbO content as illustrated in Figure 3 to minimize the amount of PbO which is evaporated from the body. Variations in the Fe and Mg contents and sintering aid content additive affect somewhat the value of the final PbO content and can be used to adjust the temperature coefficient of capacitance and sintering behaviour of the dielectric.
