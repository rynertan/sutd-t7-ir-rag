# Bib having gravitationally openable pocket.

## Abstract
A bib, preferably disposable, having a top panel, a fullwidth pocket having side seams, and an apron panel which pendul ously depends from the transverse upper edge of the front wall of the pocket i.e., a pocket panel so that the weight of the apron panel acts to gravitationally open the pocket and hold it open, and so that the apron panel may be used as a face wipe without inverting the pocket. Gravitational opening of the pocket is further enabled by virtue of the transverse upper edge of the pocket panel being disposed at a higher elevation than the top ends of the side seams of the pocket when viewed with the bib in its use orientation and or by securing together face to face areas of the pocket panel and the apron panel which are disposed adjacent their coextensive upper edges. Peferably such areas which are secured in face to face rela tion are centrally disposed with respect to the width of the bib. Also, preferably, the bib is a unitary structure comprising a sheet of a crease sustaining laminated material having an absorbent front lamina, and wherein the panels are demarked from each other by transverse fold lines which have been creased. Additionally, the bib may further comprise a duplex refastenable tape fastener a line of weakening to enable detaching all or part of the apron panel for use as a post use wipe and a detachable neck opening portion.
