# Control system for a tractor power lift system.

## Abstract
A control system for a tractor hydraulical power lift sys tem having an electrohydraulic actuator 22 coupled to a main hydraulic valve 21 , wherein the improvement comprises a feedback electronic control circuit including circuit means for mathematically combining a plurality of transducer generated signals into a command signal. The command signal compri ses the output signal of a first differential summing device 32 receiving a first input signal for a control handle transducer 24 from which is substracted a second input signal produced as the output of a signal mixer that combines input signals from a rockshaft transducer 25 , a draft selector transducer 26 and a draft load transducer 27 . The command signal and a signal from a transducer 28 coupled to the electrohydraulic actuator are fed into a differential summing device 49 that has as its output an error signal representing the actual and de sired positions of an implement to be positioned by the power lift system. The control circuit includes a sample and hold unit 51 adapted to receive the error signal. A clock logic means trans mits the error signal at predetermined times as determined by a sampling frequency clock 52 from the sample and hold unit 51 to the electrohydraulic actuator.
