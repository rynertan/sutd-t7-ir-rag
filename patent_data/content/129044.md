# Synthesis of 4 demethoxydaunomycinone.

## Abstract
It has been found that stereospecific R 4 demethoxy 7 deoxydaunomycinone can be synthesized from the known compound 4 demethoxy 7, 9 dideoxydaunomycinone. R 4 Demethoxy 7 deoxy daunomycinone is an intermediate in the synthesis of 4 demethoxydaunomycinone, the aglycone of the non naturally occurring and antitumor active 7 S 9 S 4 demethoxydaunorubicin.
