# Power measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring the mean instantaneous power supplied to an electrical device computes the product of two voltage signals each proportional to the instantaneous voltage and current respectively. A self biasing current source generates a DC signal current proportional to the magnitude of one voltage signal and a log antilog multiplier circuit 50 computes the product of the DC current signal and the other input voltage signal. A current mirror 60 connected to the multiplier cancels DC offset currents to improve accuracy of the apparatus.
