## Abstract
An apparatus for the analysis of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen contained in metals, using He as carrier gas com prising a graphite crucible 1 to heat a sample to generate a gaseous mixture containing CO, N₂ and H₂, CO and H₂ are oxidized to CO₂ and H₂O, respectively by means of an oxidiz ing device 3 . The apparatus is provided with one or two thermal conductivity detectors TCD₁, TCD₂ for detecting CO₂, N₂ and H₂O, a first gas chromatographic column 5 for separating H₂O from CO₂ and N₂, a second gas chromatog raphic column 6 for separating CO₂ from N₂ and a passage changing over valve 4 for back flushing said first column. The analysis can be speeded up and the apparatus can be simplified because of the fact that the three components O,N and H can be determined using a single carrier gas He and a single sample by means of only one measurement operation.
