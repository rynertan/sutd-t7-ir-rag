# X ray lithographic system.

## Abstract
An X ray lithographic system has a convex mirror 51 onto which flux 54 of synchrotron radiation 54 is incident. The flux 54 is reflected by the mirror 51 onto a radiation sensitive film on a wafer 56 . The mirror 51 is rotatively oscillated about an axis 52 to vary the angles of incidence of the flux 54 on the mirror 51 and hence vary the posi tions on the wafer 56 to which various components 54 a, 54 b are reflected. In this way a more uniform distribution is achieved in the exposure of the film 56 , making the system suitable for exposing relatively large semiconductor wafers.
