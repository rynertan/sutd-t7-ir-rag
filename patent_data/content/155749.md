Electrochem. Soc. The foregoing teachings disclose, among other things, the deposition of silicon and silicon alloys from organic solvents seeded with SiF₄ or SiCl₄, Si OCH₂CH₃ ₄, Si OEt . In the discussion that follows emphasis is placed on the present invention in the context of refractory metals applied as thin coatings on a substrate. The formation of thin coatings of the refractory metals is an especially difficult problem. Only chromium, of all the metals from groups IVA VIA of the periodic table, can be electroplated in aqueous media. For the others, fused salt deposition, chemical vapor deposition, electron beam evaporation or sputtering is used due to the reactivity of these metals. Such difficulties are shared in varying degree by other materials in which thin film technologies are desirable, e.g., silicon. The difficulties entailed in the prior art processes for refractory metals all have a common thread, in that all are essentially high temperature processes. The high temperatures induce metastable structures, coalescence and therefore nonuniformity of the deposited layers, thermally induced changes in the substrate, and so forth. Only ameliorative measures are possible for instance, thermalized sputtering at low voltages and high pressures will extend the capabilities of sputtering somewhat. However, the kinetic energies of the atomic clusters descending on the substrate are still considerable. A related problem is that of preparation of smooth, clean surfaces or interfaces on this group of metals. The cleanup procedures are inevitably high energy approaches. One of the present inventors Rose has extensive experience, for instance, with the preparation of niobium surfaces for superconducting tunnel junctions and also for superconducting resonant cavities for microwave appliations. The state of the art approach consists of annealing very high 2000 degrees C, typically temperatures or even direct crystal growth from the melt over 2500 degrees C , in ultrahigh vacua 10 ⁹ torr or better , or evaporation or sputtering with elaborate precautions to avoid contamination. These approaches are, of course, severely limited by practical considerations and also by thermal faceting limiting smoothness and by the formation of Gibbs isotherms on cool down which segregates all residual mobile impurities to the immediate surface. At this time both IBM and MITI Japan appear to be abandoning their major efforts at development of niobium based Josephson junctions for advanced digital computers. The central problem has been the manufacture of the junction, which is attended with the difficulties mentioned above, plus the interaction of the niobium with the electrical barrier layers around it. Amorphous metals and semiconductors have remarkable electrical, magnetic and mechanical properties and resistance to oxidation and corrosion. Again, the fabrication technology is in essence high temperature, including the above mentioned methods and especially rapid solidification and quenching. The only exception is the deposition of silicon from organic solvents. Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention to form thin coatings on a substrate in a way that mitigates or even eliminates the problems encountered when the foreging techniques are employed. Another object is to provide a novel approach to formation of a refractory or other reactive material onto a substrate. Still another object is to provide a new class of materials. A further object is to provide a new method of electrowinning of ultrapure metals and metalloids. At present, e.g., titanium is obtained by electrothermal reduction of TiCl₄ by Ca or Na fused salt electrowinning has not proceeded beyond pilot scale but is expected to expand in the future as higher purity titanium is required. Silicon has been deposited by the inventors by winning from solution and the method is applicable in general to semiconductors. These and still further objects are addressed hereinafter. The foregoing objects are achieved, generally, in a method of electrodeposition of a reactive material on a substrate, that includes the steps of establishing an anhydrous ion solution of the reactive material in a liquid electrolyte containing the reactive material and at least one of the group consisting of a halogenous compound liquid or solid , and liquid interhalogen having an appropriate electrical conductance immersing the substrate in the anhydrous ion solution and establishing an electric potential between the ion solution and the substrate to attract reactive material ions in the ion solution to the substrate where they deposit. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a process for electrodeposition of a material on a substrate, that comprises establishing an anhydrous liquid elecrolyte having an appropriate electrical conductance in the form of a halogenous compound, a hydrogen halide or a halide of a group VB element or a halide of a group IIIB element or an interhalogen, maintaining the electrolyte at a temperature between 50 K and 500 K, immersing the substrate in the liquid electrolyte and a solute, said electrolyte including ions of the material to be deposited taken from the group consisting of Zr, Ti, HF, V, NB, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Ge, B Re, gray Sn, P, Ga, As, Al, osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, platinum, silver, gold and a silicide, and establishing an electric field within the electrolyte to effect migration of ions of said material to the substrate where they deposit. The invention is hereinafter described with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Before delving into the precise details of the present invention, it may be useful to discuss the more general aspects thereof. Using the present techniques, the inventors generate a new class of materials by an approach that is fundamentally low temperature and low energy. The approach discussed herein can be used to deposit elemental metals, semiconductors and compounds thereof, at low temperatures with a control of structure that is not possible in higher temperature processes. The thickness can be controlled Coulometrically to within a monolayer. The method described in greatest detail is electrodeposition at low temperature of Nb and other refractory metals in liquid mixtures containing one or more halogen, interhalogen and halides. A particularly useful solvent is hydrogen fluoride which melts at 184 degrees K and boils at 293 degrees K and when potassium fluoride is dissolved in it, behaves very much like a molten salt. ClF, which melts at 117 degrees K and boils at 173 degrees K can also be used as it is an excellent ionizing solvent for metal fluorides and has adequate specific conductance. Excellent results have also been obtained with HCl with additives e.g., CH₃ ₄NCl that increase electrical conductance. Temperatures in the 120 170 degrees K range are not difficult to maintain and many materials contain the interhalogens of which ClF is far from the most reactive adequately. The procedure employed to practice the invention now follows. The cell see Figs. 1 and 2 used to practice the invention was cleaned thoroughly before each run. Fluorocarbon parts which were to come in contact with the plating were cleaned by soaking in a mixture of equal parts of concentrated HNO₃, HCl and H₂SO₄ for ten minutes. Brass parts and fluorocarbon parts not to be in contact with the solution were scrubbed with dilute HCl 5 aqueous . All parts were then rinsed first with distilled water and then alcohol, and wiped dry this was followed by drying in a vacuum chamber. Electrodes were prepared in the manner now discussed. Once the cell and electrodes had been prepared in this manner, they were placed in a glove box containing an atmosphere of argon purified to 1 ppm of both O₂ and H₂O. Inside the glove box the nonvolatlle solids would be added which would constitute the plating solution. These solids are referred to below as the salts, although not all of them can be described as salts in the strictest sense of the word. Composition of the salts the plating solutions all contained three substances The gas system was thoroughly purged with argon. The cell was transported from the glove box to the gas system inside a desiccator. The cell was placed inside a Styrofoam jacketed copper chill underneath the gas condenser and connected to the system. Tube connections were tightened with pliers, and electrical connections except the thermocouple were made to brass binding posts inside of a container which would seal over the wires. This was to prevent corrosion of the contacts from gas leaks. The cold trap was cooled to 72 degrees C using dry ice. The copper chills were cooled to an appropriate temperature in the liquid range of each solvent by adding liquid nitrogen to a hollow space in the insulation next to each chill. The cell was cooled first and tightened with a wrench as it reached its operating temperature. The plastic pieces tended to shrink more than the metal pieces as they became cold, and some of the seals would loosen, causing gas leaks out and water vapor leaks in. The condenser was cooled second and the holding cell last. Once all of the components of the gas system were at their operating temperatures, the solvent was applied to the system as a gas from a pressurized cylinder. Gases used for solvents were HCl, HF, BF₃ and ClF. The rate of flow was controlled with a flow meter and it was applied in rates ranging from 10 cm³ min to 1000 cm³ min. After passing through a dry ice cold trap which condenses impurities from the gas stream, the gas entered a Monel condenser tube and liquefied, i.e., liquefied gas. A constant flow of gaseous argon drove the liquid down the tube and into the main cell. On runs using hydrogen fluoride as a solvent, it was necessary to mix the gaseous HF with fluorine to remove water from it. Fluorine was also bubbled through the plating solution to remove water from the salts. The volume of gas necessary to fill the cell with liquid i.e., the liquefied gas was approximately seventeen liters. The liquid volume was about 40 milliliters. The liquid level in the cell with respect to the electrodes was determined by looking through a port in the copper chill and illuminating the cell from behind. The liquid and salts could be agitated by manipulating a magnet on a rod which drove the Teflon jacketed magnetic stir bar inside the cell. The liquid level can also be determined by conductivity measurements between various electrical leads into the cell. Current can be passed between the anode and the cathode when they are only partially immersed and certain tests were run without ever completely immersing them. I V conductometric measurements required that the reference electrode be immersed but since capillary action carried the solution up into the tube the liquid level never needed to be higher than 5 millimeters above the bottom of the cathode. This also had the effect of focusing the deposits on a small area without greatly decreasing the amount of material which could be plated over time. I V measurements were made potentiostatically, by passing current between the anode and the cathode to maintain a constant voltage between the cathode and the reference electrode. A chart recorder measured the current as a function of voltage applied and the voltage was increased incrementally in 50 millivolt steps. Occasionally, the power supply would be set to pass a constant current in order to deposit bulk amounts of material to be observed on the scanning electron microscope SEM . All I V curves were drawn from potentiostatic measurements. Sometimes the electrolyte especially HCl would become contaminated with water. When this happened, the conductivity of the cell would increase about twenty times and no metal would be deposited. The water had to be removed from the solution by distilling the solvent, otherwise no metal could be deposited. After distilling the solvent from the holding cell through the condenser back into the main cell, metal appeared to deposit normally. Solutions containing BF₃ did not become contaminated with water. Water contamination was a chronic problem with HF since most oxides of any kind react to form water in solution. Water could effectively be removed from HF by using fluorine. After a given test the liquid was withdrawn from the cell while current was passing and the cell purged rapidly with argon while the electrodes were removed as quickly as possible from the cell. The solvent was then allowed to evaporate to the scrubber and the entire system was purged thoroughly with argon. The solution on this run was KNbCl₆ and CH₃ ₄NCl saturated in liquid anhydrous HCl temperature was 93 degrees C current averaged around 1.5 milliamperes at 1.8 V with respect to Ni wire. The deposits formed on the lower 5 millimeters of Ta cathode because the cathode was immersed only that far. Examination revealed the deposits to be patches about 100 micrometers across. The deposits appeared dendritic. The total amount of Nb deposited was approximately 50 micrograms estimated from relative X ray intensities from Nb and Ta . The plating efficiency of this run was approximately 200 with respect to a 5 electron reduction step. Nb wire placed in the solution had apparently reduced some pentavalent Nb which then plated out. For this reason, some pure metal of the element to be plated was placed in the cell for each future run. After removing the solution to the holding cell and taking out the cathode, the solution was frozen at 130 degrees C while the primary cell was cleaned and dried. The cathode was replaced with a Ta plate and some K₂ZrCl₆, The electrolyte consisted of 1.00 g K₂SiF₆ dried with SiCl₄ and 0.01 g CH₃ ₄NF in pure BF₃. Because the electrode leads were accidentally switched, the cathode was platinum and the anode was nickel. The conductivity was very low in this cell. The maximum current was 50 microamperes. The scanning electron microscope revealed small, plate like deposits of silicon as well as nonconductive rough deposits containing much potassium, probably as KF with small amounts of K₂SiF₆. The salt used was K₃MoCl₆ in a solution of HCl with a small amount of BF₃. The current ranged from 50 to 150 microamperes over about 4 hours. The deposits found were confined to patches approximately 200 300 micrometers across, and appeared dendritic. They did not charge under the electron beam indicating that they were in firm contact with the substrate. The solute was Na₂WO₄ in pure HCl. The solution was contaminated with water at the beginning. The water was removed by repeatedly rinsing the cell with liquid HCl. Silicon was deposited from a solution of K₂SIF₆ and CH₃ ₄NF in BF₃. The cell was purged with Argon at the end of the run and left to warm up overnight. Silicon deposits 1000 5000 nanometers thick were observed in rounded patches 0.1 1 micrometer across. The charging rate in the electron microscope indicated extreme purity. Molybdenum was deposited from a solution of K₃MoCl₆ and CH₃ ₄NBF₄ in HCl. Patchy dendritic deposits Mo 200 300 micrometers across resulted. The crucial problem in deposition of this and other elements was the absence of water dehydration was absolutely necessary. Niobium was deposited from a solution of Nb OCH₂CH₃ ₅ and CH₃ 4NCl in a mixture of BF₃ and HCl. The niobium deposits observed were highly conductive, thin layers with thicker dendritic regions up to ten micrometers in diameter. The estimated thickness of the deposit is one micrometer. Scanning Auger analysis AES revealed oxygen to be present as well. Some expansions and explanation of the foregoing are made in this paragraph. The ion solution used in the electrodeposition process is a liquid halogen which generally includes liquid interhalogen, e.g., chlorine monofluoride or a hydrogen halide such as hydrogen chloride to which is added a material which increases the anion concentration and enhances electrical conductivity. The solution is established at a temperature where the solvent is a liquid, as indicated above, e.g., between 110 degrees K and 380 degrees K. Reactive materials that can be deposited on a substrate in accordance with the present teaching include, but are not restricted to, reactive metals taken from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, Re and W or elemental semiconductors taken from the group consisting of Si, Ge, B, P, Ga, gray Sn, Ae and As. Other metals which may be deposited include the noble or precious metals ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, platinum, silver and gold. Other materials include silicides such as MoSi₂ and WSi₂ to provide a wear resistant surface on the substrate. The product produced in according to the present teaching is totally free of thermal damage due to depositing of the material on the substrate, and the layer so deposited can be thicker than ten micrometers.
