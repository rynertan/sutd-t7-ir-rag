# Handle assembly for a pressurised dispensing container.

## Abstract
A handle assembly for a pressurised dispensing contain er consists of a handle 12 and a collar 11. The collar is fitted with legs 28, provided with bulbous portions 29 which clip resiliently into a groove 20 in the valve cup. The handle is provided with lugs 41 which engage with the collar, the handle being inserted into the collar and twisted to engage the lugs 41 with the collar to retain the handle. The lugs also press against legs 28 to prevent the collar becoming detached from the cam 13. A rachet surface 30 is provided around the top of the collar which is engaged by a tab on the handle as the handle is twisted to lock it into the collar. The rachet surface thus prevents the handle from being disengaged by being twisted in a direction opposite to that required for engaging the lugs.
