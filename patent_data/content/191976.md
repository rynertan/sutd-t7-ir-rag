## Description
This invention is concerned with an opaque film structure of enhanced opacity and brightness, inhibited against film to film blocking. In U.S. Patent No. 4,377,616 there is described a biaxially oriented opaque film having excellent overall characteristics. To use this material for some commercial wrapping purposes, it is necessary that the film be further modified so as to permit printing thereon and to permit the heat sealing or adhesive sealing of the film to itself or other surfaces. In order to prepare the surfaces of polymeric films for ink receptivity or the adhesion of glues and adhesives, it is a common practice to treat the surface of the film to enhance the wettability of these materials. Common techniques employed to increase the wettability of such materials, such as, polypropylene, include corona discharge treatment and flame treatment. In the case of the subject films, however, it has been found that such treatment leads to destructive film to film blocking. It is desired to modify films of this type so that in spite of treatment to enhance the wettability of a film surface, the films still will not destructively block together. This invention provides a non blocking film structure comprising a biaxially oriented polypropylene film surface treated to enhance its wettability, the film containing sufficient talc to prevent film to film blocking of the treated film. The present invention further provides a method of forming a non blocking polypropylene film having the surfaces thereof treated to enhance wettability comprising, prior to the surface treatment, including sufficient talc in the film to prevent film to film blocking. The film structure of the present invention comprises a biaxially oriented polypropylene surface treated to enhance its wettability, said polypropylene containing sufficient finely divided talc to prevent film to film blocking of the treated film. A preferred film structure of the present invention is an opaque biaxially oriented polypropylene film structure comprising The present invention is also directed to the described film in its surface treated form to enhance its wettability and also containing TiO₂ in its skin layers to impart paper like characteristics thereto. The subject invention is directed to the improvement of any biaxially oriented polypropylene film or surface. As indicated above, particularly preferred polypropylene structures are those described in U.S. Patent No.4,377,616. Generally speaking, the polypropylenes employable herein are from 80 100 isotactic and preferably from 95 to 96 isotactic. The subject films are ultimately treated in order to enhance their wettability and adhesion to other materials. While not limited thereto, corona discharge treatment and surface flame treatment are two common techniques which enhance the surface wettability, and, therefore the potential adhesion, of the surface to other materials. Unfortunately, such techniques are too successful in that it also enhances the tendency of the oriented polypropylene film surfaces to adhere to one another while in roll or sheet form. The surfaces of the oriented polypropylene may be treated in a known manner by corona discharge to about 35 60 dynes cm., and preferably to about 35 40 dynes cm. Alternatively the surface of the film can be flame treated by employing a Gas Flame Treating System, available from ESE CI Soc. Costruzioni Industriali, Narni, Italy. Systems of this type are described in U.S. Patent No. 2,683,894. The talc employed in the practice of the present invention, in order to prevent the treated films from destructively blocking together, is a commercially available material. Talc chemically is 3MgO 4SiO₂ H₂O. This material is also known as talcum, soapstone, rensselaerite, potstone, steatite, and French chalk. A commercially available material which has been found successful is Cyprus Mistron ZSC Talc and it may be present in from about 1.5 8 by weight of the skin layer. It has also been found that the paper like characteristics of this polymeric film structure can be enhanced by the inclusion therein of titanium dioxide, i.e. TiO₂. A satisfactory commercially available TiO₂ is SCM Glidden RCL 4. By the inclusion of from about 2 8 by wt. of the skin layer of TiO₂ in the skin polypropylene layer, enhanced opacity and brightness is obtained. The following examples illustrate the present invention. A biaxially oriented isotactic polypropylene film of approximately 0.025 mm 1 mil in thickness is corona discharge treated on one surface thereof to a level of 37 dyne cm. Ink and adhesive wetout on the untreated side is adequate however, adhesion strengths are extremely weak. With one side treated film, blocking as a result of rolling or stacking is not a problem, i.e. it will not destructively block. However, the adhesion strength between an adhesive coated untreated film bonded to a treated film is weak and commercially unreliable. Example 1 is repeated except that the film is corona discharge treated on both sides to a level of 37 dynes cm. Sections of this film are stacked one upon the other and placed under a weight of 5171 kPa 750 psi at 60 C 140 F for a period of 1 hour. The film sections block to destruction, i.e. the films cannot be separated without tearing and distorting. This film would reliably bond via an adhesive to another treated surface. However, the blocking problem must be solved. Example 2 is repeated except that the isotactic polypropylene film contains 2 by wt. of talc Cyprus Mistron ZSC Talc . Ink and adhesive wetout are excellent and printing quality and adhesive strength between bonded films are also excellent. No film to film blocking occurs under the same conditions as in Example 2. A mixture of isotactic polypropylene 93 parts, melting point 60 C and a melt flow rate of 4.5 , nylon 6 5 parts, melting point 225 C and TiO₂ 2 parts were melted in an extruder provided with a screw of a L D ratio of 20 1. A second extruder was in association with this first mentioned extruder and supplied with the same polypropylene without nylon and TiO₂ present. A melt coextrusion was carried out while maintaining the extrusion cylinder of the core material at a temperature ranging from 190 C to 220 C. The polypropylene extruded as the skin layers, was maintained at a temperature of 220 C. A film structure was coextruded with a core thickness 70 of the total extruded thickness. The skin layers were each approximately 15 of the total thickness. The unoriented film measured approximately 0.10 mm 40 mils in thickness. This sheet was then biaxially oriented using available tenter technology. The biaxially oriented film was then corona discharge treated on one side thereof. The resulting 0.038 mm 1.5 mil film had an opacity of 30 transmission and a Brightness Index of 72 at infinite thickness. Ink and adhesive wetout on the untreated side was adequate however, adhesion strengths, as in Example 1, were extremely weak. This film would have no commercial utility because of adhesive failure i.e., weak bonding and film to film separation. The process of Example 4 was repeated except that the resultant film was corona discharge treated on both sides to a level of 37 dynes cm. Sections of the resultant film was stacked under a weight of 52.5 kg cm² 750 p.s.i. for a period of 1 hour at a temperature of 58 C 140 F . The treated film blocked to destruction as in Example 2. The process of Example 4 was repeated except that the skin resin included 2 by weight of talc Cyprus Mystron ZSC Talc and 4 by weight of TiO₂ SCM Glidden RCL 4 based on the skin layer. The resulting film structure, extruded and oriented to the same extent and under the same conditions, as the film of Example 4, has a 25 light transmission with a Brightness Index of 80. The surface reflection combined with 80 Brightner Index resembles a paper like substance. This structure has unexpectedly high stiffness. Ink and adhesive wetout on the untreated side was adequate however, adhesion strength was still weak and not suitable for commercial use. The process of Example 6 was repeated except that the film was corona discharge treated on both sides to a level of 38 39 dynes cm. The printing adherence and quality was excellent. The adhesion of adhesively bonded films was at least 250 g in. The foregoing Examples illustrate that the presence of talc prevents corona discharge treated polypropylene film from blocking to destruction. The examples also show that the inclusion in the surface layer of TiO₂ in combination with the talc results in a paper like feel and appearance. A similar effect is observed on employing flame treatment of the film instead of corona discharge treatment.
