# CONTAINER HANDLING SYSTEM

## Abstract
In a container handling system palletised containers P are conveyed along a storage rail 1 , after tilting the rail 1 anticlock wise from the position shown, onto and along a picking rail 2 . After unloading, the empty pallets are conveyed back along the picking rail 2 , by tilting the rail 2 clockwise from the position shown, onto a pallet return rail 3 . The tilting controls of the rails 1 and 2 are interlocked to prevent the rail 1 being tilted from the position shown if the rail 2 is not in the position shown.
