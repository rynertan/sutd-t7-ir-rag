# Feeding system having an intermediate accumulator, and machine gun incorporating same.

## Abstract
An accumulator arrangement 10 for a machine gun has a handling conveyor 17 passing through a supply channel 16 , a bypass channel 14 , and a return channel 18 . The supply channel leads to a freed system 12 of a machine gun. At the junction of bypass channel and return channel there is connected to a return conveyor 46 leading from the feed system. A gate 24, 50, 52 is mounted at the junction of the bypass channel and supply channel operably between two positions, one position directing ammunition 58 on the handling conveyor onto a supply conveyor 44 leading to the feed system and a second position directing ammunition on the handling conveyor through the bypass channel via the return channel. Upon release of a trigger mechanism operably connected to the gun, the gate moves from its first position to the second position. The feed system continues its forward operation to clear itself of any live ammunition therein. The handling conveyor maintains a forward mode directing ammunition into the bypass channel. A reversing mechanism reverses the handling conveyor to retrieve live ammunition from the bypass channel to the supply channel after the feed system is cleared of all live ammunition. So the live ammunition intermediately accumulated in the bypass channel can be fed to the feed system during the next operation of the machine gun. The accumulator arrangement and feed system might also be used for article handling systems in general which handle individual linkless articles other than ammunition in rapid sequence.
