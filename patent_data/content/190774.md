# Record carrier body provided with preformed optically detectable servo track portions and sector addresses.

## Abstract
A record carrier body is described, in which a user can record information by means of optical radiation, which record carrier body has a relief structure of optically detect able servo track portions 7 and sector addresses. 6 If the maximum width of the servo track portions and the areas in the sector addresses is at least of the order of half the track period P the servo track portions can be tracked in an optimum manner and the sector address areas and the information areas recorded by the user provided a read signal of high amplitude.
