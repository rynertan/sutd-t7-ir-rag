## Description
The invention relates to new compositions containing a bisma leimide and a maleimide amide compound, and the polymers and objects obtained with these new compositions and by curing thereof. It is known to apply bismaleimides and maleimide amide compounds as bifunctional monomer or comonomer in compositions that are cured thermally by an addition reaction or via radicals. EP A 135964 discloses a composition comprising bismaleimide and maleimide amide compounds. The polymers and objects prepared thereof have excellent properties, such as a high HDT heat distortion temperature and a good resistance to hydrolysis. A disadvantage of the products prepared on the basis of those compositions is their brittleness or low impact strength, as is apparent from, for instance, the low percentage of the elongation at break from a tensile test . A general method for reducing the brittleness is to incorporate thermoplastics, rubbers or elastomers in the composition. To obtain a good impact strength of the fully cured polymer, it is desirable for the rubber to form a fine, properly dispersed microphase in the polymer matrix. The bismaleimide and maleimide amide compounds mentioned in EP A 135964 can be polymerized both with and without comonomer. As comonomer, use can be made of a vinyl aromatic compound such as styrene. If this comonomer is used, thermoplastics, rubbers or elasto mers cannot be dissolved in the mixtures containing bismaleimide and maleimide amide without further measures being taken. The composition according to the invention comprises It has, surprisingly, been found that, when using a hydroxy alkyl meth acrylate or aminoalkyl meth acrylate in the compositions containing bismaleimide, maleimide amide, and polymerizable monomeric compounds like styrene, terminally functional polymers as flexibilizer indeed can be incorporated homogeneously. The compounds A that contain at least 5 wt. of one or more 15 maleimide amide compounds can be prepared in a very convenient manner by the following method A diamine having the formula H₂N Z NH₂ VI where Z has the meaning indicated, is reacted with a maleic anhydride compound having formula V in a molar ratio of diamine to maleic anhydride compound of 1 0.75 to 1 2.5 and in that the mixture obtained is subsequently reacted, in the presence of a suitable catalyst, with an adapted amount of anhydride of an alkylcarboxylic acid with 2 to 7 carbon atoms, whereupon a mixture is obtained showing the desired ratio between iso maleimide groups formed by cyclodehydration, the amount of alkylamide groups formed by re alkylamidation and the amount of acid anhydride compound. For the preparation of homogeneous, curable compositions with ethylenically unsaturated compounds it is not necessary to separate the components from the mixture obtained. Removal of solvent used, alkylcarboxylic acid formed and possibly an excess of alkylcarboxylic anhydride is sufficient. In the mixtures thus obtained, mostly about 30 50 of the maleimide groups will be present in the isomeric isomaleimide form. The mixture thus will mainly contain bismaleimide, maleimide isomaleimide and bisisomaleimide compounds shortly called bisma leimide compounds , maleimide amide and isomaleimide amide compounds shortly called maleimide amide compounds and maleic anhydride compounds. Moreover, depending on the reaction conditions, small amounts up to about 5 of amide amide compounds may be present and possibly, to an even more limited extent, compounds with amide acid groups. Said compositions, that comprise bismaleimide compounds, maleimide amide compounds and acid compounds, appear to be soluble as such in simple solvents such as acetone or methylethylketone, but also in ethylenically unsaturated compounds. Solutions in copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated compounds with 5 50 C atoms comprise bismaleimide compounds, maleimide amide compounds and an acid anhydride compound, in such an amount that the weight ratio between ethylenically unsaturated compound and com position A is 2 1 and 1 4, Ethylenically unsaturated compounds are here particularly understood to mean vinyl aromatic compounds such as styrene, α methylstyrene, para methylstyrene, divinylbenzene, vinyltoluene allyl compounds such as monoallyl esters or ethers and diallyl esters or ethers, for instance diallyl phthalate vinylether and vinylester compounds such as vinyl benzoate and acrylic acid esters and methacrylic acid esters. The flexibilizer can be added after synthesis of composition A, but also previously. In the latter case, the amount of component C needed for obtaining a homogeneous mixture generally can be smaller, also higher amounts of flexibilizer can be added. Furthermore, the viscosity of the mixture is lower in case the flexibilizer is added before synthesis of compound A. If the bismaleimide and maleimide amide mixture is cured without vinylic comonomer, it is particularly advantageous to add the terminally functional polymer during the synthesis of composition A. This yields a very good end product, which is particularly suitable for prepregs. During polymerization or curing by addition reactions or via radical reactions, the terminal functional polymers react with the iso maleimide containing components, so that these become part of the matrix. It also is possible that a portion of the terminally func tional compound reacts with other components of the composition to yield modified prepolymers already before the eventual curing process. These prepolymers, too, are compatible with the bismaleimide and maleimide amide contain1ng composition according to the invention. Examples of hydroxyalkyl meth acrylates or aminoalkyl meth acrylates are 2 hydroxy ethylmethacrylate, 2 hydroxypropylmeth acrylate, 2 hydroxyethylacrylate and 2 dimethylamino ethylmeth acrylate particularly the hydroxyalkyl meth acrylates are suitable, preference being given to 2 hydroxyethylmethacrylate. By preference, a compound from this group is applied in the composition in an amount of 5 40 wt. , in particular 6 30 wt. . As flexibilizer a wide variety of polymers can be applied. It is essential for these to possess a terminally functional group suitable for an addition or radical polymerization reaction. By pre ference, use is made of mainly linear polymers that are amino , amide hydroxy , isocyanate , carboxyl , epoxy or vinyl terminated polymers, preferably with a molecular weight between 400 and 20,000, more pre ferably between 500 and 5000, particularly aminoterminated polymers. The flexibilizers are preferably applied in the composition in an amount between 4 and 16 wt. . The polymer itself can be constituted of various sorts of organic monomers like ethyleneglycol, propylenegly col, tetrahydrofurane, butadiene, acrylonitril, and mixtures thereof. Even better results can be achieved using fluoridized rubbers or poly siloxanes that are provided with a terminally functional group. Also hydroxylated or carboxylated EPDM rubbers can be applied. These types of rubber do have a molecular weight, preferably between 10,000 and 100,000. It further is to a limited extent possible to add customary substances such as inhibitors, pigments, fillers, reinforcing agents, shrinkage controlling substances, etc. Examples of possible additives are glass fibres, carbon fibres, metal fibres, aramide fibres, chalk, lime, sand, silica, aluminium oxide hydrate, polybutadiene, poly styrene, polyethylene, polypropylene and polyacrylates. For curing a radical source can be added. As such, a hydroperoxide, a perester, a perketone, and or another compound that is suitable for curing a styrene containing mixture with copolymers. Otherwise, it is also possible to induce curing e.g. by ultra violet light, optionally with a initiator. The polymers or objects obtained by curing of compositions according to the invention are characterized by a lower brittleness, with a relatively small adverse effect on the chemical, physical and thermal properties. The invention will be elucidated with reference to the following examples, without being restricted to the embodiments described therein. At room temperature a solution of 100 g 4,4 diaminodiphenyl methane in 300 ml acetone is added dropwise to 100 g maleic anhydride dissolved in 700 ml acetone. A precipitate of the corresponding dimaleimidic acid is formed quantitatively. At 60 C 150 g acetic anhydride and 1.5 g DABCO 1,4 diaza bicyclo 2,2,2 octane is added the anhydride serves as water extraction agent and the amine as cata lyst. The end of the reaction is characterized by complete disap pearance of the diamido acid precipitate. After removal under vacuum 13.3 N m² 0.1 mm Hg of the solvent, acetic acid and acetic anhydride at 50 100 C, in a quantitative yield a mixture is obtained that con sists of approx. 70 wt. N,N ,4,4 diphenylmethane bismaleimide, 25 wt. 4 acetylaminophenyl 4 maleimidophenyl methane and approx. 5 wt. maleic anhydride and minor amounts of N,N ,4,4 diphenylmethane bisacetamide. In this mixture, about 40 wt. of the maleimide groups is present in the isomeric isomaleimide form and 60 wt. in the maleimide form. This mixture is eminently suitable as basic ingre dient for the preparation of thermosetting resins. A reaction vessel, provided with a stirrer and placed in a bath that is kept at a temperature of 80 100 C by means of a ther mostat, is charged with amounts as specified in Table 1 resins 1 3 of the composition according to Example I, styrene, 2 hydroxymethyl methacrylate and in each resin a different type of a functional ter minal polymer. The mixture is stirred during 10 15 minutes, upon which a clear, transparent, reddish solution is obtained. Stabilized with 300 ppm benzoquinone, the solution remains homogeneous also after cooling to 15 20 C. After deaeration of the solution and addition of 1 wt. methyl ethyl ketone peroxide 50 wt. solution in dimethylphthalate , the resin is poured into a rectangular metal mould 130 75 4 mm . Curing takes place at room temperature, the gelation time is about 1 hour. After 8 hours, the plate obtained is kept at a temperature of 80 C for 24 hours, then at a temperature of 150 C for 24 hours and finally at a temperature of 200 C for 24 hours. The mechanical pro perties of these cast objects are presented in Table 1. It is clear that objects containing the amino terminated polymer are considerably less brittle than the unmodified products. It is remarkable to note that the addition of the reported amounts of flexibilizer does not have any adverse consequences for the HDT heat distortion temperature of the material. In analogous way to examples I and II resins 4 14 were prepared and tested, results are shown in table 2. Instead of adding a flexibilizer to the maleimide composition obtained according to Example I, the flexibilizer modification can also be integrated with the synthesis of the maleimide composition. A solution of 100 g 4,4 diamino diphenylmethane and 17.5 g NH₂ terminated polypropylene oxide MW 2000 in 300 ml acetone is added dropwise at room temperature to 105 g maleic anhydride dissolved in 700 ml acetone. A quantitative precipitate of the corresponding diamido acids is formed. At 60 C 150 g acetic anhydride and 1.5 g DABCO 1,4 diaza bicyclo 2,2,2 octane is added the anhydride serves as water extraction agent and the amine as catalyst. The end of the reaction is characterized by complete dissappearance of the precipi tate. Further treatment of the mixture is as described in Example I. The composition thus obtained contains about 10 wt. flexibilizer. A resin number 15 on the basis of 57 wt. of composition thus prepared, 25 wt. styrene and 18 wt. 2 hydroxyethylmethacrylate yields cured products having virtually the same mechanical properties as those of resin 2 of Example II. In analogous way to example IV resins 16 20 were prepared and tested. Results are shown in table 3. As is clear from the results with resins 1 17 the heat distortion temperature HDT is higher or equals 200 C, as long as more than 50 wt. BMI solid is used. In examples 18 20 the amount of BMI solid is lowered to 35 wt. which has a lower HDT as a result. In an analogous way to example I and II resin 21 was prepared with an OH terminated rubber based on polyethyleneglycol PEG with the following composition BMI resin styrene PEG 50 wt. 27 wt. 18 wt. , 5 wt. . The HDT was 225 C, the elongation at break amounted to 1.6 .
