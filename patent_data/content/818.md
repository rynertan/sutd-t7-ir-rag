# Tyre pressure monitoring system.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a tyre pressure monitoring system for vehicles having pneumatic or hydraulic tyres. The system includes an enclosed magnet 18 pivotally mounted on the wheel of the vehicle and connected to the tyre so as to pivot, about an axis 19 located mid way between the poles of the magnet, in response to changes in tyre pressure. A pick up coil 21 is mounted on the vehicle body in a position wherein the magnet passes the coil during each rotation of the wheel so as to induce an electrical signal in the coil. The electrical signal varies according to the angular position of the magnet relative to the coil during each pass. An electronic circuit in the vehicle cabin is connected to the coil and analyses the signal to determine when the magnet is in a predetermined angular position indicating that the pressure, is above or below a predetermined limit. The electronic circuit initiates a visual and or audible alarm. A system using a micro processor to provide a display of the actual tyre pressure is also mentioned.
