# Derailleur gear apparatus, e.g. for dual shift bicycles.

## Abstract
An easy to control means for shifting gears on dual shift bicycles is constructed so that the front and rear derailleurs of a dual shift bicycle are controlled together to shift to any selec ted gear from any engaged gear with a single operator action. Following gear preselection through the use of a selector actuator 34, 35 operating a shifter assembly 33 connected via spring tensioned cables to front and rear deraileurs 20, 22 a rapid series of down shifts may be made without inter vening gear selections.
