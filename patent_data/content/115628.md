# Developing head for electrophotographic apparatus.

## Abstract
In a developing head in which the liquid developer or the liquid developer and the squeezing gas are applied by means of a feeding system to the photosensitive surface of the electrophotographic material for electrophotographic apparatus via the developing chamber, the developing head for electrophotographic apparatus comprises a space made between the framed opening 2a of the developing mask means 2 at its outer peripheral surface and the opposing photosensitive surface 3a to prevent leakage of the liquid developer by capillarity from the inter val between the photosensitive surface and the framed opening 2a of the developing mask means 2 at its mouth abutting on said surface 3a a valve 17 interposed in between the passageways for feeding the liquid developer and the gas, respectively, in order to prevent the liquid developer from flowing into the passageway for supplying the gas a pressure reduction means to apply negative pressure to an interval made between the photosensitive surface 3a and the mouth of the framed opening 2a when the electro photographic material 3 is forwarded for one frame.
