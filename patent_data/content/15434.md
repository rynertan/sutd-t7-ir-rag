# Electrical resistance element for variable resistance devices.

## Abstract
An electrical resistance element 2 for use in variable re sistance devices such as trimmers and potentiometers, having two or more resistance materials 6, 8 on a nonconducting base 4 . The resistance materials are aligned along a path of travel of a movable wiper or contact 12 to provide a series of variable linear resistances or a nonlinear resistance. The inter face 16 between the resistance materials is arranged so that individual contact elements of the wiper 12 traverse the inter face at different times.
