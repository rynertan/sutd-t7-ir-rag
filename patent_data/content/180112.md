# Stabilized nose guide construction for a weaving loom harness frame.

## Abstract
A stabilized nose guide construction for use on a weav ing loom harness frame having top and bottom slats being joinded by end braces to form a substantially rectangular frame. The nose guide 18 has a pair of walls 22, 24 joined at one end and separated at the other end so that the separated ends 28, 30 can be slipped over a frame slat 10 and secured to the frame slat by a fastener 50 . The frame slat has a cylindrical bore extending therethrough. Posi tioned on the inner walls of the separated ends 28, 30 of the nose guide is a pair of cylindrical posts 32, 34 . A cylindrical stabilizing member 44 having an inside dia meter slightly greater than the diameter of the posts 32, 34 is placed on the posts and bears against the inner walls of the separated ends 28, 30 of the nose guide and against the surface extending around the bore in the frame slat 10 . This produces a rigid connection between the nose guide and the frame slat when a screw 50 is inserted through the posts 32, 34 and cylindrical stabilizing member 44 .
