# Electrodynamic transducer comprising a two part diaphragm.

## Abstract
An electrodynamic transducer 1 comprises a diaphragm with a central part 2 and a peripheral part 3 and a voice coil device 9, 10 coupled to the central part 2 . The diaphragm 2, 3 cooperates with an enclosed volume 6 , the enclosed volume being such that f₀ f₀ 0.75 S₂ S₁ where f₀ and f₀ are the anti resonance frequencies of the transducer respectively with and without the enclosed volume behind the diaphragm, which frequencies each cor respond to a local minimum situated between two maxima f₁ and f₁ respectively, and f₂ and f₂ respectively in the input impedance curves Z
