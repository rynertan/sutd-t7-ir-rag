# Vertical raster scan controller.

## Abstract
Images of one or more digitized waveforms are displayed on a vertical raster scan cathode ray tube screen. Vertical scan lines, comprising strings of pixels, represent sampling periods and each pixel along the raster scan line represents a different waveform magnitude level. A pixei count is maintained as each raster line is scanned upward and when the count reaches the value of the smaller of digitized waveform magnitude data pair acquired at the beginning and at the end of a sampling period, the next higher scanned pixels assume a color different than a background pixel color. When the count reaches a number equaling the higher of the acquired sample data, the raster scan is changed again so that the next scanned pixels assume the same color as the screen background color. Thus each waveform image comprises a set of contiguous vertical raster scan line segments. Means are also provided for selectivity generating a bit mapped display superimposed on, or replacing portions of the waveform image.

## Description
VERTICAL RASTER SCAN CONTROLLER Background of the Invention The present invention relates in general to oscilloscopes and in particular to a method and apparatus for controlling a vertical raster scan cathode ray tube for high speed display of ordinate data as a function of a monotonic abscissa value. Oscilloscopes commonly employ two methods to display a waveform on a cathode ray tube screen.In a deflected beam method, an electron beam scans horizontally across the screen at a constant rate while it is deflected in a vertical direction by a potential proportional to the magnitude of the waveform. In a bit mapped raster scan method, the waveform is digitized and converted into pixel data stored in a random access memory. The screen is divided into pixels and each stored pixel data word corresponds to one pixel on the screen. An electron beam scans the screen in horizontal lines from top to bottom turning on and off to light pixels on the screen according to the stored pixel data, thereby creating the waveform image. Deflected beam oscilloscopes typically update faster than bit mapped raster scan oscilloscopes and are therefore usually mole suitable in real time applications. However raster scan oscilloscopes permit indefinite storage of the waveform while deflected beam oscilloscopes usually do not.Also, on screen graphics, such as data indicating waveform amplitudes, oscilloscope control settings, and menus, are easier to implement utilizing bitmapped oscilloscopes with better resolution than can normally be obtained utilizing a deflected beam oscilloscope. What would be desirable would be a method and apparatus for displaying a waveform on a cathode ray tube which permits indefinite storage of the waveform, rapid update of the display, and concurrent display of high resolution graphics on the screen. Summary of the Invention According to one aspect of the invention, an oscilloscope employs a vertical raster scan display method wherein an electron beam in a cathode ray tube rapidly scans a screen in a vertical direction as it more slowly scans the screen in the horizontal direction so that the screen is scanned in a set of vertical raster scan lines. The beam turns on and off as it scans each vertical scan line so that an image on the screen comprises a set of vertical line segments. According to another aspect of the invention, an image to be displayed on the screen is digitized and stored in a random access memory as a set of number pairs. Each vertical scan line is divided into pixels and one number in each pair indicates the pixel position along a vertical raster scan line where the beam is to turn on and the other number of the pair indicates the pixel position where the beam is to turn off. A data pair corresponding to a vertical line segment is read out of the random access memory at the start of each vertical scan and placed in registers. A counter generates a pixel count as the vertical line is scanned and the count is compared with the data in the registers. When the count reaches the lowest number of the data pair, the beam turns on, and when the count reaches the highest number of the data pair, the beam turns off. This method permits indefinite storage of the waveform image in the form of data in a random access memory, as does the bit mapped raster scan method, but allows faster display update. The bitmapped method requires that the state of each of a large number of pixels along each vertical raster scan line be computed and written into memory before the display is updated. In contrast, the present invention requires only two data points along each vertical raster scan line for each waveform be digitized and stored in memory between each screen update. According to a further aspect of the invention, the beam may also be turned on and off according to data stored in a random access bitmapping memory so that a graphics display may be superimposed on the screen over the waveform display or inserted as a window in a portion of the display. The bit map is used for graphical display of oscilloscope control menus, settings and other purposes and is loaded prior to waveform sampling and therefore does not degrade waveform display update speed. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved method and apparatus for controlling an oscilloscope display permitting rapid update of sampled waveform images. It is another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved method and apparatus for controlling an oscilloscope display permitting display of high resolution graphics on an oscilloscope screen in conjunction with sampled waveform images. It is a further object of the present inven tion to provide a new and improved method and apparatus for controlling an oscilloscope display permitting indefinitely long display of an image of a sampled waveform on the oscilloscope screen. The subject matter of the present invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of this specification.However, both the organization and method of operation, together with further advantages and objects thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in connection with accompanying drawings wherein like reference characters refer to like elements.

Detailed Description Referring to FIG. 1, there is depicted in block diagram form, an oscilloscope system 10 employing a vertical raster scan controller 12 according to the present invention. The oscilloscope system 10 is adapted to permit standard Y t waveforms to be displayed on a vertically scannedCRT 22. A digitizer 14, samples and digitizes up to eight analog voltage waveforms at regular intervals and transmits digitized waveform data to a memory management unit MMU 15 which stores the sample data in a random access waveform memory 18. A typical sampled waveform is depicted in FIG.2. The voltage of the waveform is scaled along the vertical axis while time is scaled along the horizontal axis. Vertical grid lines bound sampling intervals while horizontal grid lines represent measurable voltages. For purposes of illustration the digitizer 14 is assumed to have a measurement resolution of 1 mV and a sampling period of 1 mS although digitizers having other resolutions and sampling periods may be used. The waveform is sampled at the beginning of each sampling interval.In the instant case the digitizer output data at the beginning of sampling interval 1 would indicate that the magnitude of the waveform is 11 mV while the digitizer output data at the beginning of sampling interval 2 would be 13 mV. A plot of the digitized data samples acquired along the waveform of FIG. 2 is shown in FIG. 3. The horizontal rows of small rectangles represent voltage levels while the vertical columns represent sampling intervals.A darkened rectangle indicates the magnitude of the digitizer output at the beginning of the sampling interval. According to the present invention, an image of the sampled waveform of FIG. 2 is displayed on a cathode ray tube CRT 22 screen 20 of FIG. 1. A portion of the screen 20 is illustrated in FIG. 4.The displayed image is created using the acquired sampling data of FIG. 3. The screen 20 is divided into rows and columns of pixels, as represented by the small squares in FIG. 4, each pixel column corresponding to one sampling interval and each pixel row corresponding to one mV division. TheCRT is of the vertical raster scan type wherein an electron beam is rapidly scanned in the vertical direction the raster scan and more slowly scanned in the horizontal direction the field scan so that pixels are scanned from bottom to top one column at a time. Two voltage measurements are associated with each sampling interval, one taken at the beginning and one taken at the end. When the beam is at the bottom of a column, it is off so that no pixels are illuminated. As the beam scans towards the top of a column it reaches a pixel row corresponding to the lower of the two sampled voltage levels associated with the sampling interval. At this point the beam is turned on and begins to illuminate pixels as it continues to scan upwards. When the beam reaches a pixel row corresponding to the higher of the two voltage levels, the beam turns off so that no more pixels are illuminated as it continues to scan upward. When this procedure is repeated for every vertical scan the resulting image appears as in FIG. 4.The horizontal resolution of the image can be improved by increasing the sampling rate of the digitizer 14 so that the image covers a broader expanse of the display. Referring again to FIG. 1, the scanning rate and resolution of the digitizer 14 are controlled by an executive processor 16 in response to input from a user. Acquisition memory 18 stores the sample data output of the digitizer 14 generated between screen 20 refresh operations. The memory management unit 15 then transfers the data to a display controller 24 for subsequent storage in a vertical raster scan VRS memory 26 prior to a screen 20 refresh operation. During a refresh operation, controller 24 addresses VRS memory 26 prior to each vertical scan, causing it to transmit a pair of sample data words to a VRS controller 12 for each of the eight waveforms sampled by digitizer 14. VRS controller 12 generates a VIDEO OUTPUT control signal to a CRT driver 30 which controls the vertical and horizontal scanning of the beam inCRT 22.The VIDEO OUTPUT control signal from theVRS controller 28 tells the CRT driver when to turn on and off the beam during each vertical scan. The sampling oscilloscope 10 is also adapted to display on screen 20 graphics and text data, such as graphical pushbuttons indicating where an operator should touch the screen 20 to change oscilloscope operating parameters. In the preferred embodiment, infrared scanners around the rim of the screen 20 sense the position on the screen at an operator s finger. Referring to FIG. 5, these graphical pushbuttons are displayed at the bottom of the screen 20 in a graphics display area 21 or superimposed on a waveform in a waveform graphics display area 23. Superimposed graphics in area 23 may also include grid lines, labels, data or other useful graphics. Data or graphical material may also be displayed on screen 20 in pop up windows such as window 25, temporarily replacing any waveform images that might otherwise appear in the same portion of display area 23. Referring to FIG. 1, the display is memory mapped by a conventional bit mapping circuit 32, each pixel in display 20 corresponding to a separate data word stored in a random access memory within bit map circuit 32. The stored data determines the on off or color state of the corresponding pixel. Prior to a screen 20 update operation, display controller 24 loads pixel data into bit map circuit 32 to bit map the desired text and graphical display data, as determined by user selections. Prior to the start of each vertical raster scan, display controller 24 causes bit map circuit 32 to read out and transmit to the VRS controller 12 all of the bit map data corresponding to the pixels of the vertical scan line.If the pixel data is non zero, then this data controls theVIDEO OUTPUT signal of VRS controller 12, and the waveform display data provided to the VRS controller 12 from the VRS memory 26 has no effect on theVIDEO OUTPUT signal. During the first part of a vertical scan, much of the corresponding bit map circuit 32 pixel data is non zero because the lower graphics portion 21 of screen 20 in FIG. 5 normally comprises a graphical display. As the scan reaches the top of the graphics area 21, any bit map graphics are normally superimposed on the waveform unless the graphics are included in a window 25. If the raster scan line is included in a window, the bit mapped pixel data alone will control the VIDEO OUTPUT signal with the waveform image resulting from the VRS memory 26 data being suppressed until the scan reaches the top of the window. Above the top of a window the VRS memory 26 waveform data will not be suppressed so that the upper portion of the screen 20, display area 23, will display the waveform along with any superimposed bit mapped graphics. Referring to FIG. 1, the digitizer 14 samples all eight waveforms simultaneously and sends a series of eight data words to waveform memory 18 at the start or end of each sampling interval.As display controller 24 acquires sample data from waveform memory 18, it adds different color indicating bits to the data associated with each waveform prior to storing the data in VRS memory 26. If three color indicating bits are used, eight different colors are possible. Since one color must be the background color, the waveform images may be seven different colors. Different waveforms may share the same color. VRS controller 12 includes a color table to convert the color bits to the appropriate color producing VIDEO OUTPUT signal. Each color is assigned a relative priority so that when two or more sampled waveform images try to use the same pixel on display 20, only one waveform image controls the color of the pixel. The display controller 24 also stores a number of inhibit bits in each memory location of VRS memory 26 containing data associated with each waveform sample. An age inhibit bit indicates whether the associated waveform data has been acquired since the last screen 20 update. The display is updated on a regular basis regardless of the sampling rate of the digitizer 14. If the digitizer 14 sampling rate is low, then the display will be updated more than once during the time it takes the digitizer to completely digitize the portion of a waveform being displayed. One age bit is stored in VRS memory 26 with each sampling data word.If the data obtained at one end of a sampling period is old, while the data obtained at the other end of the sampling period is new, the age bits do not match and the stored sample data is not used to control activation of the pixels in the display column associated with the sampling period.This leaves a one pixel wide gap in the displayed waveform image, thereby preventing an erroneous display due to data at opposite ends of a sampling interval being obtained between different update cycles. At the beginning of each waveform data acquisition operation, executive processor 16 stores a special null code at every waveform memory 18 location, and this data remains stored therein until replaced by sample data from digitizer 14. If a display update is initiated before the null data in memory 18 is replaced, the null code is sent to display controller 24 and stored in VRS memory 26.Display controller 24 is adapted to identify the null code and to store a null inhibit bit in VRS memory 26 along with each sample data word to indicate whether the stored data is null. If the null bit is set for either the starting or ending sample interval data points of a waveform, the waveform display fór the corresponding sampling interval is suppressed. If the magnitude of a sampled waveform is outside the range of digitizer 14, the digitizer generates an overrange or an underrange code instead of sample data and that code is stored as sample data in the waveform memory 18. When this data is sent to display controller 24 during a screen update operation, it recognizes the codes and sets on overrange or an underrange inhibit bit which is stored with each sample data word to indicate that the waveform magnitude exceeds the upper or lower limits of the digitizer. At the same time, the underrange code is converted to a number representing the lower limits of the display prior to storage in memory 26 as sample data for the sampling interval. Similarly the overrange code is converted to a number representing the upper display limit.VRS controller 12 uses the inhibit bits to determine how to use the data when generating the VIDEO OUTPUT signal. When both over range bits or both underrange bits associated with the sample data for the start and the end of a sampling interval are set, the display for the sampling interval is suppressed.When only the lower of two data points at two data points associated with a sampling interval has a set underrange bit, the raster line for the waveform is displayed but clipped at its lower limit.Similarly, when only the larger of the two sample points has an overrange indicating bit set, the raster line for the waveform is displayed but is clipped at the upper limit. The display controller 24 groups waveform data into pairs corresponding to samples taken at the beginning and end of each sample period and stores each sample pair at a separate address in VRS memory 26, along with the associated color indi cating and inhibit bits. Each vertical raster scan thus requires eight storage locations in VRS memory 26 to store the data associated with the eight waveforms. The display controller 24 uses one additional VRS memory 26 storage location for each vertical raster scan line to store a clipping data word. The clipping data indicates to VRS controller 12 the pixel elevation along a vertical raster scan line at which the graphical display area 21 or a pop up window 23 ends. The VRS controller 12, depicted in block diagram form in FIG. 6, comprises a set of eightVRS waveform registers 34 one corresponding to each of the sampled waveforms , a VRS counter 36, a priority controller circuit 38, and a VRS clipper circuit 40. Each of the eight sample data pairs associated with each sampling interval is stored at eight different addresses in VRS memory 26. Each pair includes a data word A and a data B word with either the A or B data word indicating the magnitude of a sampled waveform at the start of a sampling interval, and with the other word indicating the magnitude of the waveform at the end of a sampling interval. The clipping data word C associated with each sampling interval is stored at a ninth address. Prior to the start of a vertical scan, display controller 24 accesses the nine VRS memory 26 storage locations, causing each of the eight A and B data pairs and the clipping data C associated with the vertical scan line to be sequentially read and placed onto a data output bus 42 connected in parallel to data A and B inputs of each VRS waveform register 34 and to a data C input of clipper circuit 40.When the A and B pair data associated with the first waveform is on bus 42, the display controller 24 asserts a load control line 44 to the first VRS waveform register 34, causing only that waveform register to store the A and B pair data on the bus 42. Similarly, as A andB pair data associated with other sampled waveforms appear on data output bus 42, the display controller 24 causes the data to be stored in the appropriate waveform register 34 by asserting a separate load control signal applied to each register. When the clipping data C appears on the data bus 42, the display controller asserts another load control line 46 to clipper circuit 40 causing the clipper circuit to store the clipping data word C. When all of the VRS registers 34 are loaded with the A and B data pairs, and the clipping circuit 40 is loaded with the clipping data, the display controller 24 asserts an INIT line to theVRS counter 36 to reset a current count to zero, and to each VRS waveform register 34 and clipper circuit 40 to reset comparators therein. Then the display controller 24 transmits a vertical synchronizing signal to the CRT driver 30 of FIG. 1 to increment the horizontal position of the beam by one pixel and to initiate the vertical scan. TheCRT driver 30 then moves the beam in the vertical direction along screen 20 by one pixel each time it detects an applied CLOCK pulse generated by the display controller 24. In the preferred embodiment, the area of screen 20 which may be controlled by the VRS controller 12 is 512 pixels high and includes all of waveform display area 23 of FIG. 5 and an upper portion of graphical area 21 if display area 23 is less than 512 pixels high. When the scan reaches the lower limit of the 512 pixel VRS display area of screen 20, the display controller 24 transmits aSTART control signal to the VRS counter 36 causing the counter to begin counting the CLOCK pulses generated by the display controller 24. The current VRS counter 36 CLOCK pulse count CNT thus indicates the number of pixels that the beam scanned upward since the start of the VRS display area. The current pixel count is transmitted to aCTR DATA input of each VRS waveform register 34 and a CTR DATA input of the clipper circuit 40. The CLOCK pulse signal is also applied to eachVRS waveform register 34. When the current pixel count matches the magnitude of the smallest of theA or B waveform sample data words stored in a waveform register 34, the register places the color bits, included in the A sample data, on an n bitVIDEO output bus 48, where n is the number of color bits. In the preferred embodiment n is three, allowing eight different display colors. When the count reaches the higher of the A and B sample data words, the VRS waveform register 34 deasserts itsVIDEO output bus 48 and the output bus remains deasserted for the remainder of the vertical scan. All eight of the VIDEO output busses 48 from the VRS waveform registers 34 are connected to the priority controller circuit 38. If only one of the input VIDEO busses 48 carries non zero color bits, indicating that only one waveform image requires use of a pixel currently being scanned, then the priority circuit 38 passes the n bit color data for the waveform to a VIDEO IN input of the clipper circuit 40. If more than one of the VIDEO output busses carries non zero color bits, indicating that more than one waveform image is competing for the use of a currently scanned pixel, then priority circuit 38 transmits to the clipper circuit 40 only the color bits associated with the competing waveform image having the highest priority color.Since the color bits are used to control the color of a currently scanned pixel, the priority circuit 40 insures that the pixel color matches that of the highest priority waveform image so that the highest priority image appears superimposed on all of the others. If all of the waveform register outputs were merely ORed, the combination would produce unexpected display results. The CLOCK signal from VRS controller 24 is also applied to clipper circuit 40 and each time it detects a CLOCK pulse, the clipper circuit compares the current CLOCK pulse count from VRS counter 36 with the stored clipping data C. If the count is less than or equal to the magnitude of the clipping data, the clipper circuit 40 places a binary zero on each line of an n line VIDEO OUT bus 50. If the count exceeds the magnitude of the clipping data C, then clipper circuit 40 places the color data received at its VIDEO IN input from the priority circuit 38 on the VIDEO OUT bus 50. Display controller 24 may selectively cause the clipper circuit to suppress the VIDEO OUT signal during a complete vertical scan by setting a CLIPALL bit, added to the data C word by display controller 24 before it was loaded into VRS memory 26. Each line of VIDEO OUTPUT bus 50 is connected to an input of a separate one of n AND gates 51 while the output of each AND gate 51 is connected to an input of a separate one of n OR gates 52. A separate line of an n bit data bus 54 from bit map circuit 32 is applied to a second input of each OR gate 52. Each line of data bus 54 is also applied to a separate input of a NOR gate 53 while the output of NOR gate 53 is connected to a second input of each AND gate 51. Bus 54 carries the bit map data for the currently scanned pixel. When the CLOCK pulse count is greater than the clipping data C, bus 50 carries the color bits for the currently scanned pixel to the set of AND gates 51. If the pixel is not bit mapped, bus 54 will carry a binary zero on each line to every input of NOR gate 54 and the output of gate 54 will be high. This high output enables AND gates 51 so that the color bits on bus 50 are passed on to OR gates 52. The output of OR gates 50, applied to a color table 58 thus also comprises the VIDEO OUT color bits since the bus 54 inputs to gate 52 are all zero. The color table converts the color bits to VIDEO OUTPUT signal code sufficient to cause CRT driver 30 to generate the appropriate pixel color.Color table 58 suitably comprises a read only memory addressed by bus 56 from OR gates 52.When a currently scanned pixel is bit mapped, the data appearing on bus 54 is non zero. The output of NOR gate 54 is low so that AND gates 51 do not pass the color data on bus 50 to OR gate 52. Thus the output of OR gate 52 comprises the bit map data on bus 54. Therefore a graphical display, such as a grid, may be bit mapped and superimposed over a displayed waveform. When the CLOCK pulse count is less than the clipping data C, each line on bus 50 carries a binary 0, regardless of the value of the color bits applied to the VIDEO IN input of clipped circuit 40. Therefore the waveform image is suppressed for the pixels on the vertical scan line at an eleva tion lower than that determined by the clipping data. This feature is useful when bit mapped information is to be displayed in a pop up window which appears to cover over a portion of the waveform rather than to be superimposed on it. FIG. 7 is a block diagram depicting one VRS waveform register 34 of FIG. 6 in more detail.Waveform register 34 comprises an A comparator 60, a B comparator 62, an inhibit decoder 64, and a combination logic circuit 66. The A comparator asserts a CLOCK A output signal whenever the current CLOCK pulse count CTR exceeds the magnitude of the waveform sample data A, while the B comparator asserts a CLOCK B output signal whenever the current CLOCK pulse count exceeds the magnitude of the waveform sample data B. The A comparator also asserts a CLOCK A signal whenever the current count equals the magnitude of data A, while the B comparator also asserts a CLOCK B output signal when the clock count equals the magnitude of data B. The AGE, OVER, UNDER, and NULL inhibit bits, included with the A and B waveform data, are applied to inputs of the inhibit decoder 64 which generates an INHIBIT output signal according to the states of the inhibit bits. The inhibit decoder 64 may be a read only memory addressed by the inhibit bits or a combinational logic circuit having input and output signal relations according to the following truth table, where T denotes that the bit is asserted, F denotes the bit is not asserted, and X denotes the bit may be in any state INPUT INHIBIT BITS OUTPUT FROM DATA A FROM DATA BAge Under Over Null Age Under Over Null INHIBIT F X X X T X X X T T X X X F X X X TX T X X X T X X TX X T X X X T X TX X X T X X X X T X X X X XX X T T Any other combination F The INHIBIT output signal of inhibit decoder 64, along with the CLOCK A, CLOCK A, CLOCK B andCLOCK B signals from comparators 60 and 64, theLOAD signal from display controller 24, and the color bits associated with the Data A word are all applied to inputs of combinational logic circuit 66. Logic circuit 66 transmits the applied color bits as the VIDEO OUT output signal of waveform register 34 whenever the CLOCK pulse count is between the magnitudes of data A and data B, provided that it is not inhibited from doing so by an asserted INHIBIT signal input from decoder 64. The combination logic circuit 66 of FIG. 7 is depicted in more detail in block diagram form inFIG. 8. Each one of the input COLOR bits is applied to a D input of a separate one of n type D flip flops 70. The LOAD signal is applied to a clock input of each flip flop 70 so that at the start of a vertical scan, the color bits are latched into the Q outputs of the flip flops 70.The INHIBIT signal is applied to a D input of another type D flip flop 72 which is also clocked by the LOAD signal such that the inverse state of the INHIBIT signal appears at a Q output of the flip flop. The CLOCK A and the CLOCK B signals are applied to separate inputs of an exclusive OR XOR gate 74 while the CLOCK A and CLOCK B signals are applied to separate inputs of an OR gate 76. The outputs of gates 74 and 76 drive the inputs of anOR gate 78 and the output of OR gate 78 comprises one input to an AND gate 80. The Q output of flip flop 72 is applied to another input of AND gate 80. The output of AND gate 80 is connected in parallel to one input of each of n AND gates 82 while the Q output of each of the n flip flops 70 is applied to a second input of a separate one of the n AND gates 82.The n outputs of AND gates 82 comprise the n bit VIDEO OUTPUT signal of the VRS waveform register. When either the CLOCK A signal or the CLOCK B signal is asserted but not both the output of gates 74 and 78 are high. If the INHIBIT signal is low, indicating that the VRS display is not to be inhibited the Q output of flop flop 72 is high, causing the output of AND gate 80 to go high. If the color bit latched onto the Q output of any flip flop 70 is high, the output of the associatedAND gate 82 will also go high. Therefore the VIDEO output bus will carry the same bit pattern as theCOLOR bit input. If both the CLOCK A and CLOCK B are high or both are low, indicating that the scan is outside the upper or lower digitizer limits for the current sampling interval, then the output ofXOR gate 74 will be low.If either CLOCK A orCLOCK B input is true, indicating that the scan is on the boundary of the measurement limits for the sampling interval, then the output of gate 76 will go high, causing the outputs of gates 78, 80 and the appropriate gates 82 to go high. This ensures that if the magnitudes of data A and data B are equal, one pixel is displayed for the sampling interval. This prevents a gap in the waveform image display. If the INHIBIT signal is high, indicating that the VRS waveform display is to be inhibited, then the output of AND gate 80 will remain low so that outputs of all AND gates 82 will remain low. The priority controller circuit 38 of FIG. 6 is shown in more detail in block diagram form inFIG. 9. The priority circuit 38 comprises a set of n to 2n decoders, one for each of the m VRS registers, a set of 2n OR gates 86, and a 2n to n encoder 88. The VIDEO output of each VRS waveform register 33 is applied to an n bit input of a separate one of decoders 84. The ith output of each decoder 84 is applied to a separate input of the ith OR gate 86 and the output of each of the 2nOR gates 86 is applied to a separate input of encoder 88. The output of encoder 88 matches the highest priority color bit input to the priority controller 38. Clipper circuit 40 of FIG. 6, shown in more detailed block diagram form in FIG. 10, comprises a comparator 90 which generates a CLOCK C signal when the clock pulse count input CTR from the counter exceeds the clipping data C from the VRS memory loaded into the comparator 90 by application of aLOAD signal from display controller 24. TheCLIPALL bit, included in the data C word by the display controller prior to storage in the VRS memory, is applied to a D input of a type D flipflop 92. A O output of flip flop 92 and theCLOCK C output of comparator 90 along with theSTART signal from the display controller are applied to separate inputs of an AND gate 94 and the output of AND gate 94 is applied to one input each of a set of n AND gates 96.Each bit of the color data from priority circuit 38 is applied to a second input of a separate one of AND gates 96. When the scan reaches a pixel level above the bottom of the 512 pixel high VRS display area, exceeding the magnitude of the data C word, the output of comparator 90 is asserted, turning on AND gate 94, provided the START signal is asserted, and enabling AND gates 96. AND gates 96 then place the color data on the VIDEO IN bus from the priority circuit 38 on the VIDEO OUT bus 50 to OR gates 52.When the CLIPALL bit is set, the LOAD signal on control line 46, applied to a clock input of flipflop 92, causes the flip flop Q output to go low, thereby disenabling AND gates 94 and 96 and preventing the color data from being placed on theVIDEO OUT bus 52. In such case the entire vertical pixel line is clipped. This feature may be used by the display controller to blank selected portions of the screen, such as when the waveform to be displayed does not fill the entire screen. Referring again to FIG. 6, display controller 24 may assert a MODE control input to VRS counter 36 which causes the counter to implement a split screen mode wherein the counter pauses the CLOCK pulse count for 32 CLOCK pulses when it has reached a count of 256 pixels and then resumes counting until it reaches 512. This feature splits the VRS display area into two areas, leaving a 32 pixel high graphics only area in between the two VRS display areas for bit mapped graphics and text. FIG. 11 depicts in more detailed block diagram form the comparator circuits 60, 62, and 90 used in the VRS waveform registers 34 and in a clipper circuit 40 of FIGS. 7 and 10. The data A, B or C input to the comparator designated DATA X is applied to the input of a latch 98 and is latched onto the latch outputs when the comparator receives the LOAD signal from the display controller 24.The latch 98 output is applied to a D input of an identity comparator 100 while the current CLOCK pulse count, CTR DATA, is applied to a C input of identity comparator 100. When the magnitudes of the C and D inputs of comparator 100 are equal, comparator 100 asserts a low true output signal applied to one input of a NAND gate 102. The output of NAND gate 102 is applied to a D input of a type D flip flop 104 while a Q output of flipflop 104 is applied to a second input of NAND gate 102. The CLOCK signal from the display controller 24 is applied to a clocking input of flip flop 104 and the INIT signal is applied to a reset input R of the flip flop. When the INIT signal is asserted by the display controller, flip flop 104 resets, causing its Q output to go high. Until the CLOCK pulse countCTR reaches the magnitude of the comparator 100 input DATA X, the output of identity comparator 100 remains high and the output of the NAND gate 102 remains low. When a match occurs, the output of the comparator 100 goes low and the output of NAND gate 102 goes high. On the next CLOCK pulse, flipflop 104 sets, causing the Q output to go low, thereby preventing the NAND gate 102 output from going high again until the flip flop 104 is reset by the INIT signal. The CLOCK X signal is generated at a Q output of flip flop 104 and theCLOCK X signal is generated by an inverter 106 which inverts the output of identity comparator 100. As has been described and illustrated, the vertical raster scan controller 12 of the present invention, converts stored waveform sample data pairs into a video output signal suitable for controlling vertical raster scanning CRT driver 30, permitting rapid update and indefinite storage of sampled waveform images. Its use in conjunction with a conventional bit map circuit 32 permits bit mapped graphics to be displayed on the screen without compromising the rapidity of waveform image display update. While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects. The appended claims are therefore intended to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
