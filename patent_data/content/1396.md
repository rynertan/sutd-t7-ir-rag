# Method of cooking meat in a microwave oven.

## Abstract
A method of cooking meat in a microwave oven by determining the mean internal temperature of the meat which is indicative of the internal doneness of meat as a function of sensed and sampled time dependent in situ humidity and temperature environmental conditions of the microwave oven heating cavity. The mean internal temperature of the meat is determined as a function of its initial temperature, the net evaporative heat loss, the microwave power absorption factor and the net convective heat loss.
