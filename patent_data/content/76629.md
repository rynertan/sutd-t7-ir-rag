# Reconfigureable memory system.

## Abstract
A memory system comprises a plurality of controllers each of which controls two pairs of daughter boards, each daughter board containing a quarter of the total memory of the controller. Each controller has a set of manually settable switches defining its identity top end of memory address . Each controller includes reconfiguration apparatus which can be set, by reconfiguration commands, to store a new identity number and use that instead of the manually set number. Further reconfiguration command bits can control the effective arrangement of the daughter boards, dependent on whether the controller is half or fully populated, to put faulty ones off line. Thus on a memory fault, the complete memory space may be maintained by reconfiguring the controllers within the memory space required.
