# Buffer overcoat for CO2 ion selective electrodes.

## Abstract
An ion selective electrode for analyzing CO₂ concen tration in a liquid sample includes a support 1 having thereon a metal zone 2 , a metal halide zone 3 , an electro lyte zone 4 , a zone comprising a membrane 5 containing an ionophore and a zone 6 comprising a hydrophilic bind er and a buffer in an amount sufficient to provide a solution having a pH in the range of 7.5 to 9.5 when wetted with 5 µl of liquid.
