# Dry type developing device for electrophotography.

## Abstract
A developing roll 2 is composed of a hollow non magnetic sleeve 2a and a permanent magnet 2b disposed therein and having a plurality of poles, the sleeve 2a and the permanent magnet 2b being independently rotatable in the same direction. The hollow nonmagnetic sleeve 2a is rotatable at a constant speed. The permanent magnet 2b is rotatable at varying speeds dependent on a signal indicative of a count value from a printing density counter means for supplying a developer 6 from a developer tank 3 . The printing density counter means successively counts print data to be developed.
