# Thermal fuse.

## Abstract
A thermal fuse comprises a coil spring 3 extending under tension between two conductors 1 is locked in tension by a fusible metal 4 which extends between the connectors and covers the spring and which has a predetermined melting point, one of the coils of the spring being cut through 5 so that the electrical connection formed between said two conductors by the fusible metal is broken upon fusing of said metal, due to the resiling action of the spring portions.
