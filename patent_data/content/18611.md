# Capsule orientation control method and apparatus.

## Abstract
The method includes the steps of receiving and holding the capsules from a supply hopper 3 in such a manner that axes of the capsules are aligned with the radial direction of a rotary drum 1 and that it can be visually and spatially iden tified whether the capsules are stably held in capsule accom modating pockets 11 with the caps thereof radially out wardly orientated in an erect posture X1 or radially inwardly orientated in an inverted posture X2 through action of rotary brush means 4 rotatably provided in a position adjacent to a portion of the rotary drum 1 where the capsules X0 are received onto the rotary drum 1 from the supply hoppen 3 , and causing the capsules in the inverted posture X2 to fall down within the capsule accommodating packets 11 in a predetermined direction so as to align positions of the caps thereof with positions of the caps of the capsules in the erect posture X1 before taking out the capsules.
