# Instrument and method for calibrating nuclear cameras.

## Abstract
An instrument for tuning the photomultiplier PM tubes ofa scintillation camera to the gamma ray photon energy spec trum of interest. A finery collimated beam of photons from a test isotope is placed on the scintillator crystal in alignment with the photomultiplier tubes 16 in succession. A summing amplifier 37 develops signals that are proportional to the total energy of scintillation events. Lower and upper level discrimi nators 76, 77 define an energy window and produce output signals, respectively, depending on whether incoming total en ergy signals are within or above the window level. The output signals are sent to an integrating capacitor 106 . A sensing circuit 125 continuously senses capacitor voltage and drives visual indicators 148,151 which indicate whether the energy spectrum within the acceptable window predominates or whether energies above the window predominates and the gain of the PM tube under test is adjusted accordingly.
