# Transformer assembly and winding therefor.

## Abstract
A high voltage transformer for a video display apparatus includes a bobbin wound tertiary winding 24 . The bobbin 41 incorporates integral nonmetallic terminal posts 43 about which the winding segment wire 51 is wound and ter minated. The winding segments 19, 26 30 are interconnect ed by electrical components 31 33, 45, 46, 52 . The compo nent leads 53 incorporate a solder coating 54 and are flat tened to provide a large bonding area with the wire 51 on the terminal posts 43 . The component lead 53 overlays the winding segment wire 51 and is joined thereto preferably by a fusion bonding process. The fusion bonding removes the wire insulation 60 and melts the component lead solder coating 54 to form a reflow solder joint.
