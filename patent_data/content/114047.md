# Method and apparatus for inserting weft threads in multiple color air jet looms.

## Abstract
Multiple color air jet looms successively insert different kinds of weft threads into warp sheds to weave a fabric of de sired construction. The different weft threads are subjected to different resistances to their being drawn through a main noz zle and are carried on air jets under different conditions, so that the weft threads will be inserted unstably at different speeds. With the arrangement of the invention, selected weft threads for insertion are carried, one at a time, through the warp shed under respective different weft carrying forces suited for the weft threads. The different weft carrying forces may be pro duced by varying pressures at which air is ejected, intervals of time during which air is ejected under pressure, or the manner in which subnozzles are positioned along the warp shed. There is provided a control means for changing the air pressures and ejection time intervals in synchronism with operation of the air jet looms.
