# Data processing system.

## Abstract
A numerical control unit provided with a service processor for trouble diagnosis, in addition to a main processor, which can diagnose trouble with peripheral hardware even if the main processor goes wrong. The main processor 1 is coupled with a main memory 4 , a tape reader 5 , an NC operational panel 6 and position control circuits 7a 7n through a bus switching circuit 2 and a main bus 3 , so as to execute numerical control ordinarily. When peripheral hardware such as the operational panel have problems, the trouble diagnosis is practised by the use of a diagnosis program 4a in the main memory 4 . When the main processor 1 goes wrong, a service processor 8 stops the instruction execution in the main processor 1 and the bus switching circuit 2 conducts a switching operation to couple the service processor 8 to the main bus 3 , and the service processor 8 conducts trouble diagnosis according to a diagnosis program 10a in a service memory 10 .
