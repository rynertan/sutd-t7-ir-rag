## Description
Purification of caffeineThe present invention relates to a process for the purification of caffeine, more particularly to the production of caffeine in crystalline form which is sufficiently pure for use in pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs.Caffeine produced industrially by the decaffeination of green coffee is generally rather crude, containing approxima tely 85 caffeine, and is unsuitable for use in pharmaceuticals or foodstuffs.Several attempts have been made to,ipurify caffeine. For example, sublimation has been tried but the yield was poor due to chemical decomposition. Purification by recrystallisation from water has also been tried but the morphology of the crystals long needles forming inextricable masses caused the retention of impure mother liquor and the chemical nature of the caffeine caused associations with the impurities, preventing the formation of a pure solid phase. Even after four successive recrystallisations a product of the desired purity was not obtained.We have found, surprisingly, that if the recrystallisation is carried out from an aqueous solution containing an alkali and certain reducing agents a ery pure product can be obtained. In addition if the caffeine is extracted from an aqueous solution containing an alkali by certain water immiscible organic solvents either before cr after recrystallisation a very high yield can be achieved. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the purification of caffeine which comprises carrying out the following steps in any order a recrystallisation of caffeine from an aqueous alkaline solution of caffeine contaiIting a reducing agent and b extraction of the caffeine from an aqueous alkaline solu tion of caffeine with a substantially water immiscible solvent which is liquid under the conditions of the process.For convenience, the expression aqueous alkaline solution of caffeine in this invention refers to any aqueous solution of caffeine containing alkali even if the. pH is less than 7.The pH of the aqueous alkaline solution of the caffeine is conveniently at least 6.5 and preferably from 8 to 10.The alkali that is contained in the aqueous solution of the caffeine may be any compound,compatible with use in a food environment7 that can increase the pH of an aqueous caffeine solution to the desired value. It is preferably inorganic and may be, for example, an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. The amount used and the concentration of the alkali are conveniently chosen to achieve the desired pH. For example a 30 solution of an alkali metal hydroxide may be used in an amount of from 1 to 20 , preferably from 2.5 to 10 by weight, based on the weight of crude caffeine.The reducing agent should be of low toxicity, compatible with its use in a food environment. While sulphites may be used, a dithionite such as sodium dithionite, or zinc powder is preferred. The amount of reducing agent may vary widely but usually depends on the particular reducing agent used.For example, a dithionite may be used in an amount of from 2.5 to 15 , preferably from 4 to 10 by weight, based on the weight of crude caffeine, whereas zinc powder may be used in an amount from 0.1 to 10 and preferably from 0.25 to 2.5 by weight based on the weight of crude caffeine. Desirably, the recrystallisation is carried out in the presence of an inert protecting gas which may be, for example, helium, neon, argon or methane but is preferably nitrogen .The concentration of caffeine in the aqueous alkaline solution may vary widely, for example, from 5 to 50 but for economic reasons is usually from 7.5 to 25 by weight based on the weight of water.The temperature of the aqueous alkaline solution of the caffeine is preferably high enough to dissolve all the caffeine present and is conveniently from 500 to 100oC preferably from 600 to 800C. Recrystallisation takes place by cooling, conveniently to a temperature below 300C and preferably to a temperature from ISO to 250C. The solvent used for the extraction of the caffeine from the aqueous alkaline solution conviently has a boiling point of from 350 to 100PC and is preferably non toxic and non in flammable. The most suitable solvents are halogenated hydrocarbons, preferably chlorinated hydrocarbons for example, dichloromethane. The extraction is preferably carried out at a temperature at or in the vicinity of the boiling point of the solvent. The amount of solvent used may vary widely and may be from 0.5 to 100 parts and preferably from 1 to 10 parts by weight per part by weight of the aqueous alkaline solution. The extraction of the caffeine with the solvent may suitably take place in a counter current manner.If the caffeine is extracted after the recrystallisation, it is extracted from the aqueous alkaline solution filtered off from the recrystallised caffeine. If the caffeine is extracted before the recrystallisation, it is preferably extracted from an aqueous alkaline solution of caffeine in the absence of a reducing agent, after which the solvent phase containing the caffeine is separated from the aqueous phase, the solvent evaporated off and the caffeine dissolved in fresh aqueous alkaline solution containing a reducing agent and subsequently recrystallised. The extraction may conveniently be carried out by a continuous process. Preferably the extraction of the caffeine from the aqueous alkaline solution is carried out before the recrystallisation.By recycling the aqueous alkaline solution containing caffeine and subjecting it to one or more further recrystallisations and extractions it is possible to increase the yield of very pure caffeine. The whole process may be carried out continuously, if desired.The process of the present invention is preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure. The process can be used to pu rify caffeine obtained from any source and can easily be adapted to operate in a coffee manufacturing plant. The following Examples further illustrate the present invention. Example 1 100 g of crude industrial caffeine containing 84.8 g caffei ne were dissolved in 1 litre of an aqueous solution contai ning 6 ml of a 30 solution of sodium hydroxide and having a pH of 9 and a temperature of 700C. To this solution were added 10 g of active charcoal, 5 g of sodium dithionite and 4g of celite. Nitrogen was bubbl ed thrbugh and after mixing, the solution was filtered to remove the active charcoal, celite and impurities.The filtrate was then cooled to 200C to recrystallise some of the caffeine. The crystals were filtered off and washed with 200 ml of washing water. The mother liquor, which was an aqueous alkaline solution containing the remainder of the caffeine, together with the washing water, were extracted with 2 litres of dichloromethane at 400C in a countercurrent manner. The dichloromethane phase containing most of the caffeine was separated from the impure exhausted aqueous alkaline phase and the dichloromethane was evaporated off to yield a further quantity of caffeine, which together with the previously recrystallised caffeine weighed 55 g.This caffeine was added to a mixture of 500 g of fresh water and 1 g of sodium dithionite at 700C and the pH was adjusted to 9 by further addition of 1.2 ml of 30 sodium hydro fide. Nitrogen was bubbled through and after mixing, the temperature was reduced to 200C to recrystallise some more of the caffeine The crystals were filtered off, washed with 200 ml of fresh washing water and dried to give 30 g of pure caffeine. The mother liquor, which was an aqueous alkaline solution containing the remainder of the caffeine, together with the washing water, were recirculated and extracted at 400C with the dichloromethane which had been evaporated off after the first extraction.The dichloromethane phase containing most of the caffeine was separated from the impure aqueous alkaline phase and the dichloromethane was evaporated off and the caffeine recrystallised again as before. This recirculation of the mother liquor and dichloromethane, and the recrystallisation of the caffeine followed by drying were repeated until the yield of pure caffeine was 95 . Example 2 100 g of crude industrial caffeine containing 84.8 g caffeine were dissolved in 500 g of an aqueous solution containing 6 ml of a 30 solution of sodium hydroxide and having a pH of 9 and a temperature of 700C. To this solution were added 10 g of active charcoal, 1 g of powdered zinc and 4 g of celite.Nitrogen was bubbled through and after mixing, the solution was filtered to remove the active charcoal, celite and impurities.The filtrate was then cooled to 200C to recrystallise some of the caffeine. The crystals were filtered off and washed with .300 ml of washlng wateri The mother liquor, which was an aqueous alkaline solution containing the remainder of the caffeine, together with the washing water, were extracted with 1 litre of dichloromethane at 400C in a countercurrent manner. The dichloromethane phase containing most of the caffeine was separated from the impure exhausted aqueous alkaline phase and the dichloromethane was evaporated off to yield a further quantity of caffeine which together with the previously recrystallised caffeine weighed 44 g.This caffeine was added to a mixture of850 g of fresh water and 0.4 g of powdered zinc at 700C and the pS was adjusted to 9 by the further addition of 0,8 8 g of 30 sodium hydroxide. Nitrogen was bubbled through and after mixing, the temperature was reduced to 200C to recrystallise some more of the caffeine. The crystals were filtered off, washed with 300 ml of fresh washing water and dried to give 41 g of pure caffeine. The mother liquor, which was an aqueous alkaline solution containing the remainder of the caffeine, together with the washing water, were recirculated and extracted at 400C with the dichloromethane which had been evaporated off after the first extraction.The dichloromethane phase containing most of the caffeine was separated from the impure aqueous alkaline phase and the dichloromethane was evaporated off and the caffeine recrystallised again as before. This recirculation of the mother liquor and dichloromethane, and the recrystallisation of the caffeine followed by drying were repeated until the yield of pure caffeine was 95 . Example 3 100 grams of crude industrial caffeine containing 84.8 g caffeine were dissolved in 1 litre of an aqueous solution containing 6 ml of a 30 solution of sodium hydroxide and mixed at 400C before filtering to remove the pellicules.The aqueous phase was then extracted with 2 litres of dichloromethane at 400C in a countercurrent manner up to exhaustion of the caffeine. The dichloromethane phase containing most of the caffeine was separated from the impure aqueous alkaline phase and the dichloromethane was evaporated off leaving 74 g of caffeine. This caffeine was then redissolved in 1100 g of fresh water at 700C and 0.4 g of a 30 solution of sodium hydroxide was added to bring the pH to 9.5. 10 g of activated charcoal, 0.4 g of zinc powder and 4 g of celite were then added and nitrogen was bubbled through.After mixing the solution was filtered to remove the zinc, activated charcoal, celite and impurities. The filtrate was then cooled to 200C to recrystallise some of the caffeine.The crystals were filtered off, cleaned with 300 ml of fresh washing water and dried to give 46 g of pure caffeine. The motherliquor which was an aqueous alkaline solution containing the remainder of the caffeine was recirculated and extracted at 400C with the dichloromethane which had been evaporated off after the first extraction. The dichloromethane phase containing most of the caffeine which was present in the mother liquor was separated from the impure aqueous alkaline phase and the dichloromethane was evaporated off and the caffeine recrystallised again as before. This recirculation of the mother liquor and dichloromethane, and the recrystallisation of the caffeine followed by drying were repeated until the yield of pure caffeine was 95 . The mother liquor and the washing water can be used to dissolve a fresh charge of crude caffeine and the process repeated.
