# A method and device for the feeding of finely divided solid matter to a gas containing vessel.

## Abstract
Process and device for introducing solid particles, e.g. particulate coal, into a gas containing vessel 1 , using a centrifugal coal pump comprising a feed inlet 17 and a rotor 5 . The rotor 5 is surrounded a second gas of lower density than the vessel gas, i.e. of lower pressure and or lower molecular weight, in order to reduce friction. Low pressure hydrogen is preferred. Means 14, 14 , 8, 18 to reduce leakage are provided for.
