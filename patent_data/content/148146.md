# HYDROLYSIS OF NITRILOTRIACETONITRILE

## Abstract
A process for producing nitrilotriacetate salts from nitrilotriacetonitrile in which a mixture of substantially stoichiometric amounts of an alkali metal hydroxide and nitrilotriacetonitrile in water are partially hydrolyzed, fol lowed by boiling to complete the reaction, followed by addition of a bleaching agent, and recovery of the product as a solution or in crystalline form.
