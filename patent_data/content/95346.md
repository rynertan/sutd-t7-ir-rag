## Description
The present invention relates to the production of monoclonal antibodies and, in particular, to hybrid cell lines capable of continuously producing monoclonal antibodies directed against In recent years, the capability to produce monoclonal antibodies specific for the immunogenic determi nants of bacterial cells and toxins has provided a new vista of diagnostic and immunotherapeutic agents. The bacterial genus Untreated syphilis in man is a severe, chronic, and very complex disease that can often be extremely difficult to diagnose. Limitations with current diagnostic tools and the absence of a vaccine have allowed syphilis to flourish at the estimated frequency of approximately 350,000 cases per year in the United States alone, even with the availability of effective penicillin treatment. Moreover, there are other treponemal diseases which perhaps have a more worldwide impact with respect to morbidity and mortality. Briefly, the treponemes that cause yaws, pinta, and bejel are treponemes morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from T. pallidum. These diseases are very serious worldwide, especially in the so called third world countries. These diseases are believed to be transmitted through normal person to person contact, as opposed to Many attempts at vaccine development over past decades using whole sells, extracts, or adjuvant preparations of Syphilis and other related pathogenic treponemal disease research continues to lag far behind other areas of bacterial infectious disease. In particular, the complexity of the humoral response to The somatic cell fusion of plasmacytoma cell lines with treponemal sensitized spleen or lymph node cells to produce monoclonal antibodies specific for a treponemal species determinant provides a new and innovative way to circumvent major obstacles of the past. Once successfully carried out, a virtually limitless supply of monospecific antibodies for The invention seeks to develop continuous hybrid cell lines which produce monoclonal antibody directed against treponemal antigens. Selected cell lines are capable of continuously producing a set of monospecific antibodies that are identical with respect to combining site specificity to a single antigenic determinant exhibited by a treponemal bacteria. We have been able to provide continuous hybridoma cell lines which elaborate and secrete highly specific and homogenous monoclonal antibodies to treponemal antigens, in particular Thus, the present invention provides monoclonal antibody produced by a continuous hybrid cell line, which monoclonal antibody is characterised in that In order to obtain a suitable continuous hybrid cell line, an animal may first be immunised with In accordance with the present invention there are provided continuous hybrid cell lines that produce monoclonal antibody as defined. Continuous cell lines have been isolated which produce monoclonal antibody directed specifically against The following discussion is in terms of the preferred embodiments of this invention, which represent the best mode known to the Applicants at the time of this application. In accordance with the processes of this invention, test animals are stimulated Alternatively, normal and immune differentiated lymphocytes capable of producing antibody can be isolated from test animals, cultured, and primed with The route and schedule of immunizing the host animal or cultured antibody producing cells therefrom are generally in keeping with established and conventional techniques for antibody stimulation and production. Applicants have employed mice as the test model although it is contemplated that any mammalian subject including human subjects or antibody producing cells therefrom can be manipulated according to the processes of this invention to serve as the basis for production of human hybrid cell lines. After immunization, immune lymphoid cells are fused with myeloma, plasmacytoma, or hybridoma cells hereinafter referred to collectively as myeloma cells to generate a hybrid cell line which can be cultivated and subcultivated indefinitely, to produce large quantities of monoclonal antibodies. For purposes of this invention, the immune lymphoid cells selected for fusion are lymphocytes and their normal differentiated progeny, taken either from lymph node tissue or spleen tissue from immunized animals. Applicants prefer to employ immune spleen cells, since they offer a more concentrated and convenient source of antibody producing cells with respect to the mouse system. The myeloma cells provide the basis for continuous propagation of the fused hybrid. Myeloma cells are tumor cells derived from plasma cells which show preference for bone marrow. Plasmacytoma cells are neoplastic cells derived from plasma cells. In particular, Applicants prefer to use lymphocyte hybridoma cells which secrete no immunoglobulin. Lymphocyte hybridoma cells are cells generated by the fusion of myeloma or plasmacytoma cells with normal differentiated lymphoid cells. Myeloma, plasmacytoma, and hybridomas can be selected to be devoid of immunoglobulin synthesis. The particular species of animal from which the myeloma and immunized antibody producing cells are derived are not critical, in that it is possible to fuse cells of one species with another. However, it is preferred that the source of immunized antibody producing cells and myeloma be from the same species. Generally the fusion techniques employed are according to the procedures set out by Kohler et al, The fused hybrids are next screened for antibody production specific for treponemal antigens. A hybridoma which secretes antibody specific for, treponemal antigenic determinant is selected and cultured to establish a continuous cell line with stable genetic coding. The cell line can be stored and preserved in any of a number of conventional ways, including freezing and storage under liquid nitrogen. A frozen cell line can be revived and cultured indefinitely with resumed synthesis and secretion of monoclonal antibodies specific for the selected antigenic determinant. The secreted antibody is recovered from tissue culture supernatant by conventional precipitation, ion exchange, affinity chromatography, or the like. The recovered antibody can be freeze dried and stored under refrigeration for at least several weeks without significant loss of activity. The following examples are offered to illustrate a particular embodiment of the invention but they are not intended to limit it. A rabbit testicular antigen extract for RIA was prepared from the testicles of normal, uninfected, VDRL non reactive rabbits for the detection of monoclonal antibodies that cross reacted with rabbit antigens or were directed against contaminating rabbit host antigens present in Sonicated suspensions of The mouse plasmacytoma cell line SP2 0 Ag14 SP2 0 , which is a hybrid cell line derived from SP2 HGLK formed from the hybridization between a BALB c mouse spleen cell and the myeloma cell line X63 Ag8 described by Schulman et al, Adult female BALB c mice 6 8 weeks old were purchased from Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor, Maine and used as a source of splenic lymphocytes producing antibodies against Hybridomas were produced by fusing spleen cells from the immunized mice with murine SP2 0 Ag14 hybridoma cells SP2 0 hereinafter using a modification of the basic procedure of Kennett et al, Plasmacytoma cells were harvested from culture in the logarithmic phase of growth, pelleted by centrifugation at 270 x The cells were then pelleted, washed in DMEM, and resuspended in 25 60 ml of DME Hy medium see Kennett et al, A two fold concentration of HAT selection components in media, as specified in Littlefield et al, To each well of a Cooke 96 well microliter plate Dynatech Laboratories, Alexandria, Va. was added l0 µl of a suspension or sonicate of For the RIA test, 0.05 ml of a 4 day old hybridoma clone supernatant was added to each well containing a respective antigen preparation. After 3 hr at 23 C, the wells were washed 3 times with 0.2 ml PBS azide, followed by the addition of 2.6 x l0⁵ CPM of a mixture of affinity purified ¹²⁵ I labeled rabbit anti mouse IgG specific activity of 2.0 x l0⁶ CPM per µg and IgM specific activity of 3.7 x l0⁶ CPM per µg in 0.l ml of PBS azide 2 vol vol horse serum per well. Binding of this probe was carried out overnight at 4 C. Wells were then washed extensively with PBS and tap water. Following drying of the plates and cutting of the individual wells, counting of the wells was performed in a Nuclear Chicago model ll85 gamma counter for 0.4 minute. Antisera used as positive controls in the RIA included l mouse anti A total of 39 hybridoma cell lines were identified by RIA as secretors of monoclonal antibodies that reacted with Table l presents an example of the RIA protocol used to screen anti Mouse antibody isotypes were identified by solid phase RIA. Cooke microliter plates were coated with goat anti mouse immunoglobulin. Culture supernatants were then added and incubated for 3 hr at 37 C. Iodinated, affinity purified rabbit anti mouse heavy chain specific reagents were added to identify the isotype of antibody bound to the plate. Four hybridoma cell lines secreting antibodies specifically against Table 3 shows RIA data demonstrating anti Because of the multitude of antigenic similarities known to exist between members of the genus A class of hybridoma cell lines was also isolated that produced monoclonal antibodies found to cross react with all treponemal and rabbit testicular antigens employed in the RIA Table 5 . Because of the limiting dilution procedure employed and the fact that only one antibody isotype was observed for each cell line except one clone l2H4 , it is unlikely that these hybridoma cell lines represent more than one hybridoma clone growing together in culture. It may be of interest to note that all of these highly cross reactive antibodies were of the IgM class of antibody. Mouse anti The following hybridomas exhibited both The MHA TP test Sera Tek Treponemal Antibody Test, Ames Division, Miles Laboratories, Inc. was performed as described by the manufacturers.
