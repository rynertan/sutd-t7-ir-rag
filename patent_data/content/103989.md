# Housingless beam mill stand.

## Abstract
A housingless beam mill stand is described in which horizontal rolls 12 are mounted in chocks 30, 31 which are prestressed against a rectangular frame 15 by tension bolts 32 which pass through the chocks 30, 31 and the frame 15, in conjunction with the prestressing cylinder 41. Vertical rolls 13 are carried by roll chocks 43 which have clearance ways 44 through which the tension bolts also pass, and which permit lateral adjustment of the vertical roll chocks 43 and thus the vertical rolls 13.
