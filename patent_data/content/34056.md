# Method of producing a ceramic arc tube of a metal vapour discharge lamp and ceramic arc tube thereby produced.

## Abstract
A ceramic arc tube 12 of a metal vapour discharge lamp has an arc discharge portion 15 with electrode holding end portions 13, 14 integrally formed at opposite ends thereof. The outer diameter of the arc discharge portion is larger than that of the electrode holding end portions. The ceramic arc tube is made by placing a tubular green body 5 in a fusiform cavity 7 of a die 6 , and inflating the middle portion of the green body more than end portions thereof, and firing the thus shaped green body.
