# Sorting machine.

## Abstract
A sorting machine comprising means 12 15 for moving a plurality of objects 11 sequentially past a plurality of viewing zones 16, 17 which are spaced apart in the direction of movement of the objects so that the moving objects 11 pass to an object separation zone 20 in which relative separation is effected between desired and undesired objects light sources 21 24 on opposite sides of said moving objects for directing beams of light 31 34 to said viewing zones 16, 17 viewing means 35, 36 for effecting viewing of the objects passing through the viewing zones 16, 17 , from opposite sides respec tively of said moving objects discriminator means 40 , controlled by the output from said viewing means 35, 36 , for determining whether objects which have been so viewed are desired or undesired and object separation means 41 , controlled by said discriminator means 40 , for effecting relative separation in the object separation zone 20 between said desired and undesired objects, characterised in that said viewing means 35, 36 and light sources 21 24 are so arranged that at least most of the light which is reflected by an object 11 so as to be directed into a viewing means 35, 36 is derived from a light source 21 24 disposed on the same side of the said moving objects as the respective viewing means 35, 36 .
