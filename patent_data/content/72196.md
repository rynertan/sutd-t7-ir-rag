# Drainage device.

## Abstract
A drainage device 10 is provided with a collec tion chamber 44 , an underwater seal chamber 42 , and a separate flow chamber 80 . The underwater seal chamber which prevents the flow of atmospheric air from the device into the pleural cavity of the patient is formed by a recessed portion in a partition 40 separating the underwater seal chamber from the collection chamber. A passage way from the under water seal chamber into the collection chamber is located in the partition separating the chambers and a baffle 56 is formed around the opening to prevent loss of fluid from the un derwater seal chamber into the collection chamber when the device is tilted. The flow chamber is closed off from the collec tion chamber and is connected with the underwater seal cham ber by means of a tubular passage way 86 adjacent the upper wall of the drainage apparatus. An air flow meter 90 is provided in the flow chamber to measure the rate of air flow through the flow chamber.
