# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SYNCHRONIZATION OF PERIPHERAL DEVICES VIA BUS CYCLE ALTERATION IN A MICROPROCESSOR IMPLEMENTED DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
Synchronization of the operation of a peripheral 16 with that of a processor 12 in a multi microprocessor im plemented data processing system is achieved by bus cycle alteration. Logic circuit means 48, 62, 72 are provided for monitoring the condition of a peripheral s status bits 40, 42 and for preventing an appropriate processor control signal 80 from completing the present bus cycle if the peripheral of interest is not able to accept an access. The peripheral of interest 16 is readily identified by providing unique memory mapped locations 30 , one for each system peripheral, that are responsively connected 18, 58, 56 to the logic circuit means 48 .
