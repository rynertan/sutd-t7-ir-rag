# Tube coupling.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a tube coupling 1 for connect ing a tube portion 2 of synthetic resin to another conduit element with resistance to tensile stress in such a way that said tube portion is firmly held to resist high tensile forces due to shrinkage of the tube conduits or other high tensile forces on the one hand, whereas said tube portion is clamped within the coupling in such a way that the synthetic resin thereof is not overloaded by clamping forces. This is achieved by holding the tube portion of synthetic resin by a combination of a grip ring 6 and an elastic sealing ring 8 .
