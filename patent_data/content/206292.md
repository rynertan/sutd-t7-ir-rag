# POLYMER POLYOLS OF SUBSTITUTED STYRENES

## Abstract
Stable dispersions of poly para methyl styrene , poly vinyltoluene and other substituted styrenes can be made in polyether polyols and thereafter formed into polyure thanes. The polymer polyols made from substituted sty renes have low viscosity and good particle size and distri bution.
