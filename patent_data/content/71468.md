## Description
REFRIGERATOR AND OR HEAT PUMP WORKING FLUIDS This invention relates to a refrigerant suitable for use in refrigerating machines. When such machines are used for cooling they are termed refrigerators, when they are used for extracting heat they are termed heat pumps. Two types of refrigerating machines are commonly available compression machines and absorption machines. In a compression machine the working fluid, known as the refrigerant, works on a cycle in which it is alternatively compressed and liquified, thus giving up heat to its surroundings, and expanded and vaporised, thus abstracting heat from its surroundings. In an absorption machine the working fluid is a mixture of an absorbent and absorbate. The absorbent is usually an aqueous solution containing certain inorganic salts and the absorbate, the refrigerant in this case, is a volatile fluid. Cooling is achieved by evaporating the liquid refrigerant in an evaporator. The vaporised refrigerant is then passed to an absorber where it is absorbed in the absorbent with liberation of heat. The solution of absorbent and absorbatesubsequently flows to a generator which is heated to drive off refrigerant in the vapour form. The absorbent solution which still contains a little refrigerant then returns to the generator. The vaporised refrigerant is condensed by heat exchange with an external coolant and the liquid refrigerant returns to the evaporator to begin another cycle. DT OS 2644474 is concerned with working fluids containing lower alcohols, water and inorganic salts. DT OS 2852312 covers working fluids containing C13 amines or alcohols, water and inorganic salts. DT OS 2856767 describes working fluids containing C12 amines and ammonia or water and absorber solutions containing water, glycol and inorganic salts. None of these discloses the use of an azeotrope, however. The International Organisation of Standardisation publication ISO 817 1974 E lists certain azeotropic mixtures of halogenated hydrocarbons as refrigerants. We have now discovered that the combination of a substance which forms an azeotrope with water is advantageous for various reasons.Refrigerants containing water make use of the high evaporation enthalpy of water. Furthernore, by using a suitable combination of substances the working range can be extended and the beneficial properties of the individual substances can be combined with each other. Moreover, as compared with water as a working fluid, the freezing point of the fluid can be lowered. Finally, azeotropes have a uniform boiling point, so that no fractionation or rectification is necessary. Azeotropes according to the invention usually possess a boiling point minimum as against the individual components. As a result of this the refrigerant has a higher vapour pressure at given temperatures and given pressures compared with the individual components, which has an advantageous effect for the evaporation.However, azeotropes may also be used which have a boiling point maximum. As a result of this in certain cases the advantage of a higher condensation temperature may be achieved at given pressure on the condenser side. According to the present invention there is provided a refrigerating machine containing a refrigerant comprising an azeotrope of water and an azeotrope forming amine containing not more than 18 carbon atoms per molecule, preferably not more than 12, and most preferably at least 4. Suitable amines include both aThanolamines and hydrocarbylamines. Suitable alkanolamines which form azeotropes with water include 2 dimethylaminoethanol, 2 di isopropylaminoethanol, 2 dibutyl aminoethanol, 1 isopropylamino 2 propanol, and 1 dibutylamino 2 propanol. Preferred alkanolamines are 2 diethylaminoethanol, l dimethylamino 2 propanol and 1 diethylamino 2 propanol. Suitable hydrocarbylamines which form azeotropes with water include triethylamine dipropylamine, tripropylamine, di isopropylamlne, butylamine, dibutyl amine, tributylamine, hexylamine, dihexylamine, cyclohexylamine and pyridine. The above refrigerants are suitable for use in compression and absorption type machines. For the latter, the refrigerant is preferably used in combination with an aqueous solution of a salt conventionally used in absorption type machines. Such salts are used to increase the absorptive power of the absorbent. They include halides and thiocyanates of alkali and alkaline earth metals and zinc. The preferred halides are chlorides, bromides and iodides and the preferred metals are lithium, magnesium and calcium.
