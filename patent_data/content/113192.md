## Abstract
A device for toe and ball lasting a shoe unit consisting of a last with a shoe upper superimposed thereon and an insole arranged on the last bottom comprises main wipers seated above the shoe support for linear movement and pivotal movement about a fulcrum point and carrying, on their side opposite the fulcrum point, ball wipers arranged for longitu dinal displacement. In order to achieve perfect wiping results in the ball area, irrespective of the length, i.e., size of the shoe unit being processed, without the need to perform troublesome adjust ing or setting work on the wipers, the device is provided with a sensing element for scanning the length of the shoe unit placed upon the shoe support, and for emitting a signal indicative of the length of the said shoe unit, the said sensing element coacting with adjusting means which are controlled by the said signal and which serve to automatically adjust the initial position of the ball wipers on the main wipers to the respective length of the shoe unit.
