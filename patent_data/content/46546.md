# Apparatus for collecting solar beams.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a solar beam collector for use in collecting and condensing solar beams L to introduce them into light guides 10 or conductors. To ensure that almost all components of the white light and other radiations including ultra violet and infra red rays are introduced into the light guides, parabolic mirrors 1, 2, 3 are employed in order to converge all of the solar beams L having various wave lengths at the inlet of the light guides 10 , thereby avoiding the problem of chromatic aberration. The solar beam collector is compact in size and comprises a first parabolic mirror 1 for converging the arriving solar beams L , a second parabolic mirror 2 for condensing the beams L₁ from the first mirror 1 into parallel beams L₂ , a third parabolic mirror 3 for converging the parallel beams L₂ from the second mirror 2 at a fixed focus F , and a light guide 10 having an inlet end placed at the focus F of the third mirror 3 .
