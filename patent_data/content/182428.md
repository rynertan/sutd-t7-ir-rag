# A tunable magnetron.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a tunable magnetron having coaxial cathode and anode systems 13 and 11, 12 which between themselves define an annular, in operation evacuated interaction space 18 and a rotatably arranged tuning body 20, 24 sup ported by two rolling bearings, suitable ball bearings 21,22 . The tuning body 20, 24 with its bearings 21, 22 is situated in an evacuated space 25 communicating with the interaction space 18 , and a magnetic circuit having two pole shoes 16, 17 , situated one on each side of the interaction space for producing an axial magnetic field through the interaction space 18 , is closed through the rolling bearing 21 situated closest to the interaction space. In order to prevent magnetic interaction forces between the rolling bodies from influencing the rotation in the case of continuous operation, in particular if the bearings have no retainer ring, at least the rolling bodies in the bearing 21 situated closest to the interaction space 18 are made of non magnetic material, e.g. non magnetic hard metal or ceramic material.
