# Ski binding.

## Abstract
A ski binding toe or heel clamp, is provided with a toe or heel clamping arm 5 rotatably supported by a post 4 fitted on the top surface of a ski 3 , the post having a pendulum 10 facing a projecting end 11 of the clamping arm which is urged towards the toe or heel of a ski boot 2 by a spring on a stud 8 . The clamping arm is locked by the pendulum and keeps the toe or heel clamped with the ski under normal use. In the event of a lateral bump or fall, the pendulum swings thereby unlocking the clamping arm and enabling the boot to be released from the ski if the force of the spring is overcome.
