# Masking process for semiconductor devices using a polymer film.

## Abstract
A masking process for semiconductor devices comprises the steps of forming a first material film 3 on a semiconductor substrate 1 forming a second material film 4 on said first material film 3 selectively removing said second material film 4 exposing a structure thus formed to a gas plasma atmosphere to form a plasma polymerization film 5 on at least an exposed surface of said first material film 3 removing a remainder of said second material film 4 and removing the exposed surface of said first material film 3 by using said plasma polymerization film as a mask to form a first material film pattern 3 .
