# Power converter for AC load.

## Abstract
A power converter that drives an AC motor includes a main circuit and a control circuit such that the main circuit includes a forward conversion circuit that forwardly converts AC power from an input AC power source into DC power, and an inverter circuit that inversely converts the thus forwardly converted and smoothed DC power into AC power of a specified voltage and frequency the control circuit includes a calculation device that calculates a torque current component of the AC motor, a detection device that detects occurrence of an instantaneous interruption in the AC power source, a command device that commands a frequency to be fed into the AC motor, a control device that receives a signal relative to an output signal of the command device, so as to control a terminal voltage of the AC motor, and a compensa tion device that adjusts the output signal of the command device so that the output signal of the calculation device is caused to be substantially zero in response to the output signal of the detection device.
