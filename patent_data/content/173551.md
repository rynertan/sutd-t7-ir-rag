## Abstract
A bar of soap 1 is provided with a central body 2 formed of a buoyant material whereby the soap will float in water. The body 2 may have an additional purpose, as promotional ma terial as a decoration, as a toy, gift or gimmick of some kind.

## Claims
C t A I M S 1. A bar of soap CIlAR CTERISED IN THAT it comprises buoyant material in an amount sufficient to render the net weight of the bar less than water such that it floats in water. 2. A bar of soap according to Claim 1 CHARACTERISEDIN THAT the buoyant material is in the form of a body 2 enclosed within soap 1 . 3. A bar of soap according to Claim 2 CHARACTERISEDIN THAT the body 2 is hollow. 4. A bar of soap according to Claim 2 or Claim 3CHARACTERISED IN THAT the body is formed from a natural material. 5. A bar of soap according to Claim 2 or Claim 3CHARACTERISED IN THAT the body is formed from a plastics material. 6. A bar of soap according to any of Claims 2 to 5CHARACTERISED IN THAT the body comprises promotional material. 7. A bar of soap according to any of Claims 2 to 5CHARACTERISED IN THAT the body comprises a novelty item.

## Description
SOAP This invention relates to soap and is directed at the problem of bars of soap being lost or obscured in water during use. Soap being heavier than water, a bar of soap will tend to sink in a body of water. Where the water is dirty or heavily lathered the bar can be temporarily lost.Relocating it is further complicated by the slippery nature of the wetted soap itself, particularly when the bar has been reduced by use to a small size. Various means have been proposed for mounting soap such that it is accessible at all times, but each has imposed some restriction on the use to which the soap can be put. According to the present invention a bar of soap comprises buoyant material such that its net weight is less than that of its volume of water. Typically, the bar encloses a central body comprising the buoyant material, the buoyancy of which is greater than the net weight of the bar in water whereby the bar will float. Various buoyant materials can be used, suitable materials being Styloforms or sponges, In use, the bar es not require careful storage, but can be lert in the water where it will float at or near the surfaca and be visible. It is thus readily available at all times. A further advantage of the invention where a central buoyant body is used, is that substantially all the soap in the bar can be used, down to the central body which can then be discarded or recycled. The central portion can take many forms or shapes, and may comprise promotional material, a prize or giet,or some collectors item. For examples, the portion might be a toy or trinket of some kind, or may contain a sequence number or digit, or combination of numbers or digits indicating a potential prize or reward. Thus, soap manufacturers which in some cases are non profit making organizations can be sponsored by comnlercial concerns. In another alternative, the body may be hollow to provide the requisite buoyancy, but may also contain items such as first described.Messages andJokes might be included for example, as in party crackers. The invention is illustrated by way of example in the accompaning drawing in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a bar of soap according to the invention, partly broken away to show its structure and Figure 2 is a section taken a line A A of Figure 1, As shown in the drawing, a bar of soap 1 is moulded around a body 2 of buoyant material. The body 2 may be formed as an hollow body to give it the requisite buoyancy, or in an inherently buoyant material such asStyloforms or sponges. Synthetic plastics materials such as expanded polystyrene may also be used. Plastics materials are preferred where the body is to have some other purpose such as a novelty item or promotional emblem, or where it is to be an hollow body. The body 2 constitutes only a relatively small proportion of the total volume of the bar of soap, typically around 15 . The actual proportion will depend on the respective materials of the soap 1 and body 2, Between 108 and 208 is however preferred as this rcoults in a seize of bar that is useable down to the central body but carries a sufficient quantity of soap when new. Such a proportion also enables the central body to be of such a size as to fulfil another purpose and described above, such as a brooch or emblem, if desired.
