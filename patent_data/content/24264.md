# PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF ANTIKNOCK FUEL AND PRODUCT PREPARED BY THIS PROCESS

## Abstract
Procedure for the manufacture of an antiknock fuel con sisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons with denatured ethyl alcohol, that is, for making the ethyl alcohol, and all alcohols and ketones in general and methyl alcohol and acetone in particular, soluble in hydrocarbons, to afford an antiknock fuel which does not require the addition of tetraethyl lead. 96 ethyl alcohol is placed in a reaction cylinder tank in a percentage ranging from 10 to 44 , with first distillation light hydrocarbons forming the remainder to 100 . Calcium carbide is then added in an amount equal to 5 by weight of the ethyl alcohol used. The reaction is run for 24 48 hours.
