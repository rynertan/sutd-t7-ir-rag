## Description
FIELD EFFECT SEMICONDUCTOR STRUCTURE This invention concerns semiconductor device structures of the metal semiconductor field effect transistor MESFET type. The MESFET type of device has a metal Schottky barrier type junction gate over a channel between source and drain contacts. Signals applied to the gate can operate to change current flowing in the channel between the source and drain contacts by enhancing or depleting carriers in the semi conductor of the channel. A limitation has been encountered in these structures in that efforts to increase the speed by increasing the current have encountered conflicting disadvantages. The techniques for enhancing the current have involved high impurity concentration and increase in width of the channel. The high impurity concentration, however, reduces the mobility which has the effect of offsetting the high impurity concentration for the achievement of current enhancement.It also deteriorates the integrity of the Schottky barrier gate which in turn increases the gate current and requires a very thin conductive channel region for tpinch off or, in other words, to be able to completely shut the device off. This makes control more difficult. A wide channel will result in an ineffective use of the substrate area or low density and will also produce a large associated capacitance which will slow down the speed of operation. The limitations of these two approaches have made improvements in current handling capacity of devices difficult. Here, the invention intends to provide a remedy. Basically, in accordance with the invention, in a MESFET structure with a Schottky barrier gate, a channel region is made up of alternate layers of two semiconductors. One layer has a wide energy gap that is heavily doped and serves as a barrier, and the other has a narrow energy gap that is lightly doped or undoped and serves for conduction. The heavily doped wide gap regions that serve as barriers give up electrons that fall into the adjacent potential wells of the narrower gap material and serve for conduction. The impurity doping and layer thicknesses are governed by the consideration that there are to be no conduction electrons in the barrier region. The layered channel provides a modulation conduction band edge which is superimposed on the usual Schottky barrier potential profile.The result of this is that electrons are confined in migration and the resul ting conduction operates with the mobility advantages of a low impurity concentration yet with the effectiveness of a high impurity concentration. These advantages provide increased speed and frequency response. An embodiment of the invention is described in the following and shown in the appended drawing, in which FIG. 1 is a view of a MESFET transistor with a Schottky barrier gate and a layered channel. FIG. 2 is an energy band diagram showing the potential profile of the various layers in the channel. FIG. 1 shows a schematic illustration of a metal semiconductor field effect transistor MESFET , in which on a semi insulating substrate 1 there are provided source 2 and drain 3 regions shown, for example, as being of n conductivity type with electrical connections 4 and 5, respectively, to each. A Schottky barrier metal electrode 6 having an external contact 7 is provided which forms a Schottky barrier contact with the channel region, of n conductivity type, shown generally as 8 which in turn is made up of alternate layers of two semiconductors 9 and 10, respectively. The two semiconductors 9 and 10 in FIG. 1 are as follows. The semiconductor 9 has a narrower band gap and is undoped or lightly doped. Semiconductor 9 serves for conduction. The semiconductor 10 has a wider band gap and is heavily doped. Semiconductor 10 serves as a barrier. For purposes of illustration, the description will be set forth using as examples GaAs for the narrower gap conduction semiconductor 9 and GaAlAs for the wider gap barrier semiconductor 10 and semi insulating GaAs for the substrate. In the light of the principles of the invention it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that other semiconductors may be sub stituted. The combination provides a modulated conduction band edge wherein electrons fall from donor levels in the heavily doped barrier to the adjacent potential well of the lower energy gap semiconductor. This may be seen in connection with FIG. 2 wherein an energy diagram is shown with the right hand side correlated with the contact 6. Electrons from the donor levels shown as in the heavily doped barrier semiconductor 10 fall as indicated by the arrows to the lower potential level of the conduction semi II II conductor 9 where they are shown as In FIG. 1 the GaAlAs regions 10 are relatively heavily doped, as would be the case in an ordinary GaAs MESFET, for example, to greater than 1017 atoms atoms per cm .The gallium arsenide regions 9 on the other hand, however, are either undoped or are lightly doped to a concentration in the vicinity of 1014 atoms per cm3. The thicknesses of the individual layers 9 and 10 are not critical and are of the order of 100R. The total number of layers 9 and 10 is determined from considerations such as the magnitude of the pinch off voltage, as is true in ordinary MESFETs.The purpose of the layered channel illustrated in FIG. 1 is a transfer of electrons as shown in FIG. 2 from the depleted barrier regions to the accumulated well regions, or, in other words, a disassociation of carriers from their contributing impurities in the semiconductor. Such a set of conditions makes it possible to have, in the conducting gallium arsenide region of the channel 8, both the advantages of a high carrier concentration and a high mobility. Therefore, the current carrying capacity and respons iveness of a device such as shown in FIG. 1 is increased. In operation, since the dependence of eletron mobility on temperature is much stronger for lightly doped gallium arsenide, the enhancement in mobility or current will become more pronounced at lower temperatures. As an example, using the impurity concentration set forth above, such enhancement would be about a factor of 2 at room temperature and a factor of 20 at liquid nitrogen temperature. The individual layers Df the structure with thicknesses of the order of 100R and the alternating arrangement from gallium arsenide to gallium aluminum arsenide at specific doping densities, can be fabricated by a number of deposition techniques known in the art molecular beam epitaxy is one of the better controlled techniques and is the preferred approach.What has been described is a layered structure in the channel of a MESFET which operates to give in effect the advantages of high impurity density and large width while in fact having lower impurity density and better mobility and the capability of higher density of integration.
