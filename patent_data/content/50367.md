# Lens assembly for a video recorder playback machine.

## Abstract
A lens assembly is positionally adjusted for pre cisely focusing a light beam upon a video information disc in a video recorder playback machine. The lens as sembly includes a focusing lens 35 supported on an air bearing within an assembly housing 37 for movement toward and away from the disc. A current conducting coil 90 is movable with the focusing lens 35 and is adapted to receive an electrical current indicative of instantaneols focusing error of the light beam upon the disc. A fixed magnetic field formed by a permanent magnet 94 mounted on the housing between opposite pole pieces comprising portions of the housing is mag netically coupled with the coil 90 whereby variations in the current result in adjustement of the position of the focusing lens 35 with respect to the disc to correct the focusing error.
