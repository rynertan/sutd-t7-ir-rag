# Method for transformation and direct selection of transformants in eucaryotic cells.

## Abstract
Direct selection of the desired antigenic protein or proteinaceous product of transformed cells containing exogenous nucleic acid coding for the antigenic product is achieved using one or more of a panel or pool of monoclonal antibodies which detects or is specific for any such antigenic product. This method eliminates the need for inclusion of a separate phenotypic genetic marker for selection such as a gene for antibiotic resistance. Such a phenotypic marker could be included however, linked or unlinked to the DNA coding for the desired antigenic product, to allow for pre screening selection of clones bearing the genetic marker for the desired antigenic product.

## Description
METHOD FOR TRANSFORMATION AND DIRECT SELECTION OF TRANSFORMANTS IN EUCARYOTIC CELLS This application is continuation in part of copending application Serial No. 606,986 filed May 4, 1984. This work was supported in part by United StatesGovernment funding grants CA 31937 and CA 10095 fromNational Cancer Institute. Therefore, the government has certain rights in this invention. This invention concerns recombinant DNA technology wherein exogeneous DNA coding for an antigenic substance is incorporated and expressed in eucaryotic cells.Selection for these transformed cells is effected directly by the use of antibody such as a panel of monoclonal antibodies for selecting out the transformed cells in a screening process.Summary Exogenous or foreign nucleic acid sequences such as found in DNA or RNA coding for specific proteins such as surface cell antigens are transferred into recipient eucaryotic cells. Screening for these specific proteins by a panel of antibodies such as monoclonal antibodies specific for the transferred human DNA protein product allows for the direct selection of the transformed cells.Description In 1980 Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer were awarded a patent 4,237,224 which is hereby incorporated by reference for transformation of bacterial cells by means of a plasmid or viral DNA into which was inserted foreign or exogenous DNA material. This altered replicon could then be used to transform bacterial cells which would then express the foreign DNA and its product It was the aim of that invention to use the bacterial cell as a living factory to produce for example, hormones and antibiotics eventually, molecules which it could not produce naturally and which were not produced in sufficient quantity by the foreign organism. In the Cohen and Boyer technique selection for transformants is done by means of another piece of DNA inserted into the replicating plasmid or vector one for antibiotic resistance for examples, to provide a phenotype useful in selecting transformants. Therefore on medium containing the antibiotic, only the transformed cells survive. One then tested these colonies for proper expression of the desired product Product might be released into the supernatant growth medium or if in the cell, cells would be broken apart and extracted to yield the product These tend to be tedious biochemical processes. Thus the need for at least two foreign DNA insertions or co transformation, where one piece of DNA codes for the phenotype necessary for the selection process and another codes for the desired protein product These transformed cells would multiply to provide multiple genomic copies.The method of Cohen and Boyer represented a method for transfer of genetic material in organisms which did not naturally exchange genetic material. Many eucaryotic cell products however need extra steps past translation to be biologically effective molecules.These extra steps are lacking in bacteria. Bacterial endotoxin contamination is another obstacle to use of these products in animals of hTzmans. Recently Axel et al. have patented processes for cotransformation of eucaryotic cells U.S. Patent No.4,399,216 which is hereby incorporated by reference.These processes depend on a DNA segment acting as a phenotypic marker for selection of transformed cells. The patent basically covers a method for insertion of foreignDNA in linked or unlinked segments into eucaryotic cells.The linked insertion covers an amplification technique producting the phenotype marker in increasing amount in the selection procedure e.g. by increasing antibiotic concentration in the selection medium one selects for multiple copies of the phenotype DNA marker and therefore may get multiple copies as well of the exogeneous DNA coding for the desired protein product These linked or unlinked phenotype genetic markers used for selection of transformants must be present in theAxel et al. method. Axel et al. do not select for a specific desired protein product directly, only through the phenotype marker. In a marked improvement of the above, the present invention uses one or more of a panel of antibodies such as monoclonal antibodies to screen for the desired protein product thereby obviating the need for an added genetic piece serving as a phenotypic marker. In essence the protein product of the transformed cell is the phenotype marker as well which acts not only as a protein product but as an antigenic marker for selection of transformed cells.Thus there is no need for another phenotypic marker to select transformed cells. Inclusion of the second DNA piece can also be done as linked or unlinked DNA , for use as a pre screening selection device, before screening positive clones by the method of the invention. The invention concerns a new direct selection method for transfonnants not the indirect method of the prior art. Since most protein products are antigenic the selection method is an immunological one of wide applicability. Highly specific antibody such as monoclonal antibody mAb is preferred. In 1975 Köhler and Milstein 1975 Nature London 256 495 introduced a procedure for the production of monoclonal antibodies mAbs using hybrid cells hybridomas which allows the production of almost unlimited quantities of antibodies of precise and reproducible specificity. Conventional antisera, produced by immunizing animals with tumor cells or other antigens, contain a myriad of different antibodies differing in their specificity and properties, whereas hybridomas produce a single antibody with uniform characteristics. The Kbhler Milstein procedure entails the fusion of spleen cells from an immunized animal with an immortal myeloma cell line. From the fused cells hybridomas , clones are selected that produce antibody of the desired specificity. Each clone continues to produce only that one antibody.As hybridoma cells can be cultured indefinitely or stored frozen in liquid nitrogen , a constant supply of antibody is assured. Antibodies are proteins that have the ability to combine with and recognize other molecules, known as antigens.Monoclonal antibodies are no different from other antibodies except that they are very uniform in their properties and recognize only one antigen or a portion of an antigen known as a determinant. In the case of cells, the determinant recognized is an antigen on or in the cell which reacts with the antibody. It is through these cell antigens that a particular antibody recognizes, i.e. reacts with, a particuiar kind of cell. Thus the cell antigens are markersby which the cell is identified. These antigenic markers may be used to observe the normal process of cell differentiation, and to locafe abnormalities within a given cell system. The process of differentiation is accompanied by changes in the cell surface antigenic phenotype, and antigens that distinguish cells belonging to distinct differentiation lineages or distinguish cells at different phases in the same differentiation lineage may be observed if the correct antibody is available.Initial rec ognition of differentiation antigens came about through ana iysis of surface antigens of T cell leukemias of the mouse and the description of the TL, Thy 1, and Lyt series of antigens. Old, Lloyd J., Cancer Research, S, 361 375,February t981 . The analysis of these T cell differentiation antigens was greatly simplified by the availability of normalT cells and B cells of mouse and man and is relatively advanced. See Patents i4,361,549 550 iit4,364,932 37 and 4,363,799 concerning mAb to Human T cell anti gens Little is known about differentiation antigens displayed on normal and neoplastic cells belonging fo other lineages. This is due to the difficulty of obtaining a ready source of the appropriate normal cell type as well as the vagaries of the art of monoclonal antibodies. The preparation of hybrid cell lines can be successful or not depending on such experimental factors as nature of the innoculant, cell growth conditions, hybridization conditions etc. Thus it is not always possible to predict successful hybndoma preparation of one cell line although success may have been achieved with another cell line. Progress in defining surface antigens on melanocytes was made possible by the recently discovered technique of culturing melanocytes from normal skin Eisinger, et al.,Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA, 79 2018 March 1982 U.S.Patent Application S.N. 469,854. This method provides a renewable source of proliferating cells for the analysis of melanocyte differentiation antigens. Cell surface antigens of human malignant melanoma identified by mouse monoclonal antibodies have been described. Dippold et al. Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 6114 6118 1980 U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 307,060. The melanoma work continues in Houghton et al. 1982 J. Exp. Med. 156 1755 U.S. Patent Application S.N.445,561 and in Albino et al. 1983 J. Immunol. 131 1595U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 481,378 filed April 1, 1983 which latter concerns mAb to gp130 found to be the same as the gp150 of Dippold et al. Suora . Previous work on human renal cancer is found in a co pending patent application Serial No. 277,814 Monoclonal Antibodies ToCell Surface Antigens of Human Renal Cancer and inSerial No. 474,224. U.S. Patent Applications on Colon U.S. Patent application serial number 474,415, bladder S.N. 567,066 lung S.N. 474,225 etc. show the wide range of tissue types covered by mAb panels for screening purposes. The above patent applications and references are hereby incorporated by reference. Therefore serological and biochemical analysis using mouse monoclonal antibodies mAb has identified a number of cell surface molecules on cultured and non cultured human melanoma and other cells. In addition to components of the major histocompatibility complex, these mAbs have defined a variety of differentiation antigens, which has led to an appreciation of the important of specific antigens as markers associated with particular developmental lineages, stages of differentiation and or neoplastic versus normal states of cell growth. The detailed structure of most of these antigens, as well as their biologic functions, remain to be elucidated.Clearly isolation of recombinant DNA clones encoding surface antigens of interest would greatly aid in the characterization of these molecules and in the dissection of the regulatory mechanisms that govem the specificity of their expression. To study the structural and functional nature of these antigens, we have transferred human DNA sequences encoding melanoma surface antigens to recipient B78H1 cells, a clonal population of B i6 mouse melanoma cells highly competent for the exogenous uptake and expression of selectable genes. We employed a transformation strategy analagous to that used by Axel et al.Suora that entails application of mixed coprecipitates containing human melanoma DNA together with a cloned selectable vector, pGCcos3neo. Using a pool of 18 mouse mAbs to human melanoma antigens and a rapid screening assay based on red blood cell resetting and visual identification in situ of primary transfectants expressing new antigens, we have succeeded in stably transferring to B78H1 cellsDNA sequences encoding a siaioglycoprotein of 130,000 molecular weight Mr gp130 . This antigen is present on cultured human melanoma lines 40 43 , most cultures of astrocytoma 7 10 and to a lesser degree on a wide range of other malignant or normal cell types.Subsequent analysis of secondary transfectants revealed that the transfected gp130 had an identical Mr, isoelectric point, intracellular processing and spatial orientation of surface exposed epitopes as that seen with gp130 from human melanoma donor cells. However, cell surface expression of gyp130 on mouse transfectants was 24 fold less than on the donor human melanoma cells. The examples illustrate the method of the invention without limiting it The method of the inventidn is widely applicable to transformation and selection of transformants generally. Thus clones incorporating genes coding for human proteins or proteinaceous substances which are antigenic such as interferon, growth hormone and the like can be selected for by this method. Any suitable eucaryotic or prokaryotic cell can serve as the competent cell to accept any plasmid or DNA coding for the desired factor. PREPARATiON OF DNA High molecular weight DNAs were prepared from cultured human or mouse melanoma cell lines by methods known in the art as described by Axel et a Suora Molecular weights of these DNAs were in excess of 50 kilobases Kb as judged by comparison to coelectrophoresed lambdaDNA.

Fused cells 5 8 X 105 in 1 ml of selective medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and theymidine were added to wells of tissue culture plates Costar no. 3524, 24 wells pwer plate . Hybridoma cultures were subcloned at least three times by limiting dilution on a feeder layer of 1 3 x 105 mouse peritoneal macrophages.Culture supernatants were monitored for antibody activity on a panel of cultured cells. Antibody subclass was determined by double diffusion in agar with anti lg heavy chain specific reagents Bionetics, Kensington, M.D. . Cultures of cloned hybridomas were injected subcutaneously into nu nu mice Swiss background and were also stored in liquid nitrogen.Sera from mice with progressively growing tumors were collected, stored at 700C, and used for serological and biochemical characterization.SEROLOGICAL PROCEDURES Anti lgG IgG MHA indicator cells were prepared by conjugating the immunoglubulin fraction of rabbit anti mouse lg Dako, Copenhagen to human 0 erythrocytes with 0.01 chromium chloride. Wash 0 RBC once with coldVeronal Buffer VBM with graduated centrifugation 5 min at 1,000 rpm 5 min at 1,500 rpm 5 min at 2,000 rpm Wash RBC two times more with cold saline with graduated centrifugation. Resuspend pellet in an equal volume of saline. Then while gently vortexing, add a volume of rabbit anti mouse serum or goat anti mouse serum, proteinA or, in general, serum reactive to mouse lg equal to the volume of packed RBC. The PA is always at 1 mg ml. Therefore, there is a 1 1 1 ratio of RBC saline PA. TheProtein A is added slowly. Dilute the 1 CRY13 solution of 0.01 with saline at 20C. Stock is kept in a dark bottie.Again, while mixing slowly, add dropwise a volume of 0.01 CrOb that is equal to 10 times the volume of packedRBC e.g., if 0.25ml was the volume of RBC then the volume of Cr013 added would be 2,25ml. Keep this mixture in suspension for 5 min at 20C. AddVBM and wash two times with graduated centrifugation. Resuspend in VBM as a 10 v v suspension which diluted to 0.2 working dilution with PBS plus 5 FBS or 1 albumin. Stock RBC PA is 10 solution which is stable at 4 C for 1 2 weeks. Working dilution is 0.2 .Therefore, dilute stock 50 fold when ready to test target cells for absoption of IgG. Plates containing neo resistent transferents were washed and incubated with a pool of mouse mAbs for 60 min at 20C. The plates were washed two times with phosphate buffered saline and anti mouse IgG indicator cells were added to the plates and allowed to incubate for 45 min at 20C. The plates were washed two times and scored for colonies binding erythrocytes which could be seen as a red button when observed under a fluorescent light box, or as erythrocytes bound to individual cells of the colony when viewed microscopically.

The solution was clarified at 10,000 x g and the supematant was used for immunoprecipitation reacts as described above.Example IEXPRESSION OF GP130 ON THE CELL SURFACE OF B78Ht TRANSFERENTS. When a mixed coprecipitate of high molecular weightSK MEL 131 DNA and the plasmid pGCcos3neo was added to B78Ht mouse melanoma recipients, a fraction of the neo colonies surviving in Geneticin containing selective medium were found to express one or more human melanoma cell surface antigens. Identification of these antigen positive colonies was made on.coded dishes containing neo resistant transferants by means of a mixed erythrocyte resetting assay in which cell surface display of some 18 antigens reactive with individual mouse monoclonal antibodies was simultaneously tested.The gene transfer and the rosetting assay were both highly specific, in that colonies that bound erythrocytes to an extent permitting visualization by macroscopic examination were detected only when coprecipitates contained human melanoma DNA and not when mouse melanoma DNA was employed instead.The majority of colonies thus identified were shown, upon clona isolation, mass culture growth and immuncohemical characterization with each of the 18 mAbs individuals to be expressing a human melanoma sialoglycoprotein, gp130.The aggregate frequency of human melanoma DNA mediated gyp730 gene transfer in the three experiments that yielded transferents was on the average of 1.8 x 104 perB78H1 recipient or on the average of 4.3 X 104 perGeneticin resistant colony the frequency on control dishes receiving mouse melanoma DNA was less than 5 x 10 7 per B78H1 recipient 0 gp130 positive neo gene transferent colonies on 17 dishes . Gp t30 is the gp150 ofDippold et al.,Suora Albino et al. J. Immunol. 131 1594 1 983 1 SECONDARY TRANSFER OF GP130 DNA SE QUENCES. DNA purified form two primary transfectants of B78H1 expressing gp130 as a consequence of transformation withSK MEL 131 or SK MEL 141 DNA could transfer gp130 encoding sequences in secondary founds of transfection ofB78H1 cells as described above. Secondary transfer of the gp130 gene occuned in 2 of 2 experiments and it was specific in that only DNA of primary gp130 transferents 6 coloniesf4.5 X 10 6 B78H1 cells and not control mouseDNA 0 colonies 2 x l0 5 B78H1 cells transfers the gp130 positive phenotype. RADIOIMMUNOPRECIPITATION ANALYSIS Radioimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed the anti gp130 mAb R23 precipitates a protein of t30 kD from both the human donor melanoma line and from the recipient mouse secondary transfectant line. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis indicates that the gyp130 in both cell types has an identical isoelectric point of 5.5, indicating, therefore, that the gel 30 protein transcripts of the transfected gene have been glycosyiated to the same extent and degree as in human donor melanoma cells.INTRACELLULAR PROCESSING OF THE GP130 MOLECULE IN TRANSFECTANTS. gp130 positive B78H1 secondary bansfectant cells were pulsed with eS methionine for 15 min, then chased with nonradioactive medium for increasing periods of time.The cells were washed, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with mAb R23. After a t5 min pulse, the only protein species specifically precipitated by mAb R23 migrated with a Mr of 100,000 designated prt00g . After a chase period of 30 min, pnoogp is processed into its final form, migrating as a 130 Kd component No detectable intermediate species between the precursor form and the end product was detected. The processing of the gp130 in mouse secondary transfectants was identical to that seen in the donor human melanoma line, SK MEL 1 31, and identical to that shown in another melanoma line, SK MEL 28 Dippold et al. Suora . Both the pry 00gyp precursor and the final product, gp130 can be labeled with 3H D glucosamine. We have previously shown that the biochemical event responsible for the increase in Mr of the pnoogp precursor to 130,000 Kd is the processing of N linked oligosaccharide side chains, and that an 80 Kd unglycosylated species is the primary translation product of the encoding mRNA. Albino, A.P., et al. t983 J. Immunol. 131 1595. ABSORPTION ANALYSIS OF THE GP130. To determine if the transfected cells express gp130 at similar levels as the donor melanoma cells, a quantitative absorption analysis was period Dippold, et al. Snort The expression of gp130 on the cell surface of transfectedB78H1 secondary mouse cells was approximately 24 fold less than that seen on the donor human melanoma line.Control B78H1 cells did not absorb gyp730 antibody reactivity over the range of cell numbers tested. This example describes the method of stable transfer of sequences encoding a cellular antigenic substance such as a cell surface glycoprotein of 1 30kD from human melanoma genomic DNA to recipient B78H1 mouse melanoma cells, a specific example of the method. The strategy involved 1 transformation with total cellular DNA with a cloned selec table gene vector, PGCcos3neo 2 the use of recipient cells which are highly competent for uptake and expression of exogenous DNA sequences such as B78H1 cells and 3 the employment of a rapid immunolgical screening assay that permits visual identification and immediate clonal selection of cells expressing transfected genes. This approach has operational and genetic advantages over fluorescence activated cell systems FACS technology previously used to isolate transfected genes in that a it is inexpensive, requiring a minimum of resources b a large number of colonies can be screened in a short period of time c it permits identification and isolation of putative antigen transferents upon initial screening with mAbs, even at very low levels of transfer efficiency and d each colony isolated probably represents an independent transfer event.A genetic advantage of the detection of transferent colonies expressing new surface proteins markers by screening viable colonies in situ, as opposed to methods e.g., FACS or direct immunoselection which require multiple rounds of enrichment for antigen expressing cells, is the unambiguous independence of transfer events represented by different colony isolates. As examples we have used genomic DNA from two independently derived cultured melanomas SK MEL 131 and SK MEL 141 and from a cultured lung carcinoma SK LU 6 in transfection experiments with B78H1 cells. The resultant transferents, now having the neo resistent phenotype were screened with a battery of 18 mAbs prepared against melanomas Dippold et al, SuDra , but most of which detect antigens having a broad distribution on malignant tissues. From each of these three genomic DNAs the genetic sequences encoding gyp130 were transferred toB78H1 cells. The frequency of primary transferents which were positive for gp130 antigen was approximately 1 in 2 5X 101, irrespective of the donor DNA used. Inability thus far to isolate B78H1 transferents for any of the 17 other antigens represented in the the mAb pool other than gp130 may reflect inability of the assay to detect colonies of cells displaying extremely low levels of antigen.However, we cannot at present exclude alternative explanations such as involvement in antigenic phenotypes of multiple genes or genes difficult to transfer, restriction of expression of certain genes due to species differences or inappropriateness of the stage of differentiation represented by B78H1 cells, unsuitability of the B78H1 membrane as a matrix for display of potentially antigenic products made from transferred genes, etc. Using probes for Alu type repeat sequences and southem blot analysis, large amounts of human DNA was shown to be integrated in the mouse genome of primary transfectants positive for expression of gp130. However, secondary transfectants did not have detectable Alu type sequences.Presumably, this indicates that the gel 30 related sequences are either unique sequence DNA or has other non Aiu type repeats. While it is formally possible that the lack of detectable major human repeat groups implies that the mouse transfectants are actually expressing a mouse gp130 homologue, we think it unlikely for the following reasons 1 five monoclonal antibodies to different epitopes determinantsA,B,C,D, E of the gp130 molecule are mouse antibodies Dippold et al, SuDra, but note gp150 is gp 130 as determined in Albino et al.J. lmmun.131 1595 1599 1983 and each reacts with the transfected gp130 molecule displayed on the surface of B78H1 cells 2 numerous tests failed to detect either cell surface or intracytoplasmic expression of gp130 related molecules in mouse B78H1 recipient cells 3 the frequency of transfer of gp130 gene from humanDNA to mouse cells is in the range predicted for a single copy gene 4 no difference was found in the molecular weight, isoelectric point or intracellular processing of gp130 from human cells and that which was presumably transfected to mouse cells and 5 gp130 expression in B78H1 cells was absolutely dependent upon exposing B78H1 cells to human DNA. However, our present attempts to molecularly clone the transfected gp130 from mouse cells will allow us to definitely prove the human origin of this molecule and to detect any mouse homologue.Example II We have recently succeeded in transferring sequences encoding a renal carcinoma cell surface antigen which is biochemicaily unrelated to the gp130 molecule to B78H1 cells Kantor et al., manuscript in preparation . DNA sequences from a human renal carcinoma cell line, SK RC 41, coding for a cell surface glycoprotein, gp170 140 30, have been stably transferred to recipientB78H1, a clone of B16 mouse melanoma cells using DNAmediated gene transfer techniques. Gp170 140 30 has been found on virtually all cultured cells it is seen in tissues only on kidney glomeruli, thyroid microglands and urothelium. Its molecular structure includes a 170,000, 140,000 and six 30,000 weight mw species. Calcium phosphate coprecipitates of DNA from SK RC 41 and the plasmid vector pGCcos3neo were applied to cultures of B78H1.After selection with Geneticin the cells were analyzed for expression of gp170 140 30 using mouse monoclonal antibodies in a mixed hemadsorption rosette assay Ueda et al.Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. Supra . Southern blot analysis of 1 transfectants with either Alu or whole human nick translated probes revealed large amounts of human sequences while 2O transfectants were found to lack major human repeat elements. Biochemical analysis of gp170 140 30 on 20 transfectants compared to SK RC 41 revealed 1 120 fold lower expression 2 slightly different mw of 170,000 and 140,000 polypeptides 3 multiple forms of the 140,000 and 30,000 mw species. These differences suggest either an altered processing of gp170 140 30 or a possible recombination with an homologous murine species. We are currently engaged in elevating the number of copies, and hence the net cellular expression of introduced human genes by cotransferring them with an amplifiable vector into B78H1 cells. Results of these experiments may provide information about the level at which restrictions on the expression of transferent phenotypes for antigens other than gp130 lie. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art following the teaching of this invention to use specific antibodies such as monoclonal antibodies to generally select for transformed cells directly since the specific mAb identifies the gene protein product directly. A recent publication used the method of the invention Littman et al. Cell 40 237 246 February 1985 at page 238, col 1. 1st and second full paragraphs. The authors were taught the method at Sloan Kettering by the inventors. The authors apply the method to detect a variety of human T lymphocyte cell surface antigens expressed in mouse L cells. The authors observe that rosettepositive clone is never seen in the absence of the transforming DNA, thereby confirming the reliabiiity of the tests. Thus one can also use single or pooled mAbs to select for transformed cells quickiy, e.g. pools of 10, 20 or 100 mAbs or groups of pooled mAbs to select for the expression of the desired foreign antigenic product Pre screening using a selectable genetic marker such as one coding for antibiotic resistance is also possible. Multiple copies can also be incorporated as well as several different DNA s coding for different antigens.
