A horizontal tube 12 branches from the vertical tube and has its outer end closed by a wall having an aperture 25 through which passes a closure member 15 . An open bottomed float 29 surrounds and slides on the vertical tube 1 and has on its inner periphery a cam surface 36 which engages a cam follower surface 18 on the valve closure member 15 . The water level in the trough is maintained approximately constant.
