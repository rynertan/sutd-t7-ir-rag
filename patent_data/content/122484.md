# Fuel composition.

## Abstract
A fuel composition comprising a hydrogenated material obtained by hydrogenating a reaction mixture ranging from C₁₁ to C₁₆ containing mainly compounds which comprise butadiene and cyclopentadiene as basic structural units, pro duced by reacting an acyclic conjugated diene with cyclopen tadiene, dicyclopentadiene, an alkyl substituted cyclopen tadiene, or an alkyl substituted dicyclopentadiene in accor dance with the Diels Alder reaction or an isomeric material prepared by isomerizing the hydrogenated material or a mix ture of the hydrogenated material and the isomeric material.
