## Description
This invention relates to the addition of carboxylated surfactants and inorganic salts to a potassium hydroxide solution as a means of obtaining high contrast and high sensitivity for the development of positive resist films, in particular, alkali soluble resin diazo ketone photoresist. Contrast values gamma greater than 5 are obtainable with optical sensitivities less than 25 mJ cm² while maintaining negligible film loss from unexposed resist. The present application is an improvement over the invention disclosed in US application of J. M. Lewis, et al. for High Contrast Photoresist Developer , Serial No. 660,600 filed on October 15, 1984 now US A 4 670 372, equivalent to EP 0 178 496 . Photoresists are polymer films which change their solubility response to a developer solution after the film has been exposed to an irradiation source, such as ultraviolet light or a beam of electrons or ions. As a consequence of the exposure, a different solubility rate results between the exposed and unexposed masked over portions of the photoresist film that yields a surface relief pattern after the development of the film. Those photoresists which become more soluble in the exposed regions are referred to as positive acting. However, because the alteration of the solubility of the photoresist is only a relative change and even the less soluble unexposed portions of the photoresist dissolve to some extent, any process which enhances the developing rate difference i.e. contrast between the exposed, relatively soluble and the unexposed, relatively insoluble photoresist portion is advantageous. Positive photoresists are typically comprised of an aqueous alkaline soluble resin, such as novolac resin or poly p hydroxystyrene , and a diazonaphthoquinone sulfonic acid ester sensitizer. The resin and sensitizer may be applied by a method such as spin coating from an organic solvent or solvent mixture onto a substrate, such as silicon wafers and chrome plated glass plates. Developers that have been used to process the positive photoresists are aqueous alkaline solutions such as sodium silicate, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide. Various salts have been added to the developers in order to increase the sensitivity of the resist. These salts include sodium phosphate, sodium borate, sodium carbonate, and sodium silicate. The addition of the corresponding acid will generate the salt in the developer, so the sodium cation is not a specific requirement. However, no improvement in contrast or resolution capability is realized. The majority of existing positive photoresist systems can have a maximum contrast value gamma of three 3 to five 5 depending upon the processing condition. The problems associated with gammas of this order are evident in the reported performance. Typically, gammas of this order are obtained by using a weak developer and prolonged developing time with an attendant loss of throughput. Gammas of greater than 5 have been achieved through the addition of certain surfactants to the developer. Quaternary ammonium surfactants increase the contrast of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide developers and fluorocarbon nonionic surfactants increase the contrast in alkaline hydroxide, i.e. NaOH and KOH developers. These surfactants provide the high contrast, but the developer life is limited for repeated dip developing processes. Typically, the surfactant effect is greatly diminished after the first material has been developed with a resulting change in the exposure required. These developers lend themselves well to spray developing processes in which the developer is continuously replenished or used once and discarded as in a puddle process. A positive photoresist aqueous base developer that gives high contrast, high sensitivity and a stable bath life is desirable. The gamma obtained should be greater than five 5 the sensitivity, better than 40 mJ cm² and the bath life, greater than 400 wafers developed per gallon of developer. The high contrast provides line width control and process latitude in photoresist imaging. The high sensitivity allows for high throughput of wafers on the exposure tool. The long bath life provides a large number of substrates to be processed before changing the developer bath which reduces the cost of using the developer in terms of time and economics. The line width control is important in cases where fine lines are to be defined in the resist that covers steps or topography on the coated substrate. The line width of the patterned resist geometries change in dimension as the line crosses the step. The higher the contrast of the resist, the less the effect on dimensional change crossing a step. The process latitude afforded by the high contrast is a result of the ability to over develop the exposed resist without affecting the unexposed resist in the adjacent areas. As a result, extremely small geometries of less than one micrometer can be patterned and the resist processing is less susceptible to change in conditions, such as exposure. The high sensitivity is important to the throughput of the patterning process. The shorter the exposure time required, the more substrates can be processed through a given exposure tool in a given time. This feature is particularly important for direct write operations such as electron beam and ion beam lithography where throughput is critically dependent on the sensitivity of the resist system. For photolithography, the high sensitivity will allow setting the optics of the exposure tool to provide the best image quality. Finer lines can be patterned with smaller apertures which reduces the exposure level without sacrificing the throughput of an exposure tool. This is critical in projection aligners that project the image through a lens system onto the substrate. High contrast developers can change after the first batch is processed. The changes are observed as a change in sensitivity and the corresponding change in the linewidth of the patterns. These changes prove to be detrimental to the linewidth control. Accordingly, a need exists for an improved developer which provides superior contrast and the effectiveness of which does not change significantly as subsequent batches of substrates are developed to the extent that of the order of more than an equivalent of 400 silicon wafers 100mm in diameter can be developed in four 4 liters of developer. From GB A 1492620, EP A 0133216 and EP A 0148787 developing processes are known, using alcaline developers comprising surfactants. EP A 0178496 not prepublished European patent application according to Article 54 3 EPC refers to a process for developing a positive radiation sensitive resist film by contacting the exposed film with an aqueous alcaline developer solution containing a carboxylated surfactant. Subject matter of the present invention is a process for developing a positive radiation sensitive resist film according to claim 1. Preferred embodiments of this process are subject matter of claims 2 to 4. Further subject matter of the present invention is the use of a composition according to claim 5 for developing radiation sensitive films. Preferred embodiments thereof are subject matter of claims 6 to 10. This invention is applicable to lithographic exposures utilizing photons, electrons and ions. Specifically, as a result of the improved sensitivity, higher throughput during lithographic processing for the fabrication of semiconductor devices and photomasks is realized. The developer of the invention affords a higher resolution capability of less than one micron on projection exposure systems where the image is somewhat defocussed, i.e. with the higher contrast, smaller geometry dimensions can be patterned in the resist. In addition, the invention provides resist performance that is stable over the life of the developer bath when used as an immersion developer. The high contrast, sensitivity and bath life is obtainable in accordance with the invention by the addition of inorganic compound s usually an inorganic salt which furnishes ions, e.g. potassium carbonate, to all aqueous alkali metal base containing a carboxylated surfactant. The preferred alkali metal bases are potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide. The carboxylated surfactants contemplated by the invention are those encompassed within the formula The photoresists employed with the developer of the present invention are those sensitizer resin compositions in which the exposed portions of the composition become more soluble upon exposure. Suitable sensitizers used in positive photoresists of this kind are diazo ketones having diazo and keto groups at adjacent positions on the molecule, such as the quinonediazide sulfonic acid derivatives which are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,958,599 3,046,110 3,046,114 3,046,116 3,046,118 3,046,119 3,046,121 3,046,122 3,046,123 3,106,465 3,138,983 3,635 709 3,711 285 4,174,222 which are hereby incorporated by reference. The photosensitizer acts to decrease the solubility of the resin. Upon irradiation the photosensitizer undergoes a chemical reaction to form a carboxylic acid which increases the rate of solubilization of the photoresist in the exposed areas. Suitable alkali soluble resins may be employed in the positive photoresists. Those contemplated by this invention, for example, include the prepolymerized phenolic aldehyde resins, e.g. phenol formaldehyde, which are known as novolac and are available commercially. Resins of this type are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents 3,201,239 3,868,254 4,123,219 and 4,173,470, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. These phenolic aldehyde resinous compounds must be soluble in organic solvents and aqueous alkaline solutions. A number of phenolic compounds and aldehydes or aldehyde producing compounds will yield novolac resin through well known syntheses. Phenolic compounds that may be used include, but not limited to, phenol, xylenol, cresol, resorcinol, napthol, hydroquinone, alkyl phenols and halogenated phenols. Illustrative of the aldehydes and aldehyde producing compounds that may be used, but not limited to, are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, formaline, acrolein, crotonaldehyde and furfural. We have discovered in accordance with the invention that a very significant improvement in sensitivity of the developer can be obtained by the incorporation into the developer of certain inorganic salts together with the carboxylated surfactants described in the US application, Serial No. 660,600. In accordance with the invention, the addition of the inorganic salt to carboxylated surfactant modified developer that comprises an aqueous alkaline metal base, preferably potassium hydroxide, results in a substantial improvement in sensitivity without subsequent loss of contrast or duration of developer bath life. This improvement in performance is attained by a balance among the concentrations of the base, surfactant and salt since each will affect the contrast and or sensitivity in a predictable manner. For example, increasing the base and or salt concentration will result in enhanced sensitivity up to a practical limit as defined by that point where film loss becomes intolerable. The surfactant provides high contrast but with an accompanied reduction in speed of development. This reduction in sensitivity negates to some extent the increased sensitivity due to the presence of salt. However, the effect on developer performance of the carboxylated surfactant and salt individually are quite dramatic. This is most easily seen by comparison of the examples that illustrate the invention. For example, the presence of 83 ppm of carboxylated surfactant in a 0.2 N KOH solution will improve the contrast value gamma from 2 to 7 as shown in Examples 1 and 5, respectively. The addition of the surfactant causes a slight but noticeable loss in sensitivity from 20 mJ cm² to 25 mJ cm², but the unexposed resist film loss is reduced from 3 to no loss with surfactant containing developer. The addition of an inorganic salt such as potassium carbonate increased the sensitivity from 20 mJ cm² to 12 mJ cm² as shown by Examples 1 and 27 however, the film loss is greater, 7 vs. 3 , and there is no accompanying improvement in the contrast, both give gammas of 2. The addition of the salt to the surfactant containing developers increased the sensitivity from 25 mJ cm² to 7 mJ cm² as shown by Examples 5 and 26 but without any increase in unexposed film loss, both have no loss, and the contrast remains high, both have gammas of 7. As with these and other examples, the combination of surfactant and inorganic salt gives increased sensitivity without sacrificing contrast and unexposed resist. Of the several salts which may be employed, we have found that carbonates may be advantageous used, potassium carbonate is preferred although other carbonates such as sodium carbonate, lithium carbonate, etc. may be employed. Additionally, either solid or gaseous carbon dioxide may be added directly to the developer to generate the carbonate directly in solution. Alternatively, salts containing the cations K , Na , Mg , Li , or H , and the anions SO₄² , Cl , PO₄³ , Br , NO₃ , borates or silicates may be employed. In the developer system of the invention, the surfactants are those set forth in the above referenced US patent application, Serial No. 660,600, i.e. those characterized by the formula R O C₂H₄ O In using the developer, such as the potassium hydroxide developer, without the carboxylated surfactants and salts of the invention or surfactants other than the surfactants of the invention, e.g. Aerosol OS 0.005 the contrast were 2.2 and 2.6 and sensitivities greater than 25 mJ cm². In using the developer described in this invention, wherein an ion furnishing inorganic compound was also incorporated in the developer, contrast values greater than 5 were obtained with sensitivities of less than 25 mJ cm² and typically less than 5 mJ cm² with a bath life of greater than 400 wafers of 100 mm developed in one gallon of developer with no loss in photoresist performance. The photoresist used in the comparison was a novolac resin with a diazonaphthoquinone sulfonic acid ester photosensitizer. The photoresist coating was prepared by spin coating. The substrates were silicon wafers typical of those used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. These wafers were subjected to 200 C dehydration bake followed by a precoating treatment with vapors of hexamethyldisilazane for 10 minutes at room temperature immediately prior to coating. The wafers were spun at a speed so as to provide a one micrometer thick film. The coated wafers were baked at 90 C for 30 minutes in a forced air convection oven. After baking, the wafers were exposed to either ultraviolet radiation or an electron beam. Photolithography consisted of exposing the coated wafer through an Opto Line step tablet resolution mask with windows of various optical density so as to provide various exposure levels on the same wafer. The incident ultraviolet exposure was such as to provide a range of exposures through a step tablet mask from no exposure to exposure sufficient for the resist to develop to the substrate. Other techniques can be employed by those skilled in the art to obtain areas or wafers of known exposure levels for the purpose of evaluation. Electron beam exposure was performed with an unmodified Perkin Elmer Autoscan electron microscope under manual control. An acceleration voltage of 20 Kev was employed at a beam current of 6nA. The raster pattern of the electron beam was roughly that of a square with a length of ca. 20 micrometers on each side at a magnification of 3000X and a working distance of 12 mm however, exposure across the rastered area was nonuniform. Relative changes in sensitivity were evaluated by comparison of the minimum exposure times required to completely clear the electron beam exposed pattern. The increased sensitivity obtained with use of the invention for electron beam exposed resist is illustrated by comparison of Examples 28 and 29. Note that relative to the developer of the comparative example, the base concentration was decreased and the surfactant concentration was increased for the invention. Both changes would tend to decrease the overall sensitivity of the system. Nevertheless, an increase in sensitivity of a factor of 3 is obtained with the invention. After exposure, the resist can be contacted with the developer composition of the invention by any suitable manner for known developers, such as immersion, spray and puddle techniques. The novel developer composition of the invention operates at a pH of at least 9 and Preferably at a pH above about 10.5 and more preferably above 12. Following development, the workpiece can be rinsed with water and further processed in a conventional manner. The thickness of the photoresist remaining can be measured by any suitable method, such as interferometry, profilometry and elipsometry. Amounts of carboxylated surfactant from about 0.0001 to about 1.0 by weight of the developer may be used with advantage. The more effective level of the carboxylated surfactant ranges from 0.005 to 0.5 . The preferred range is 0.01 to 0.1 . The concentration of potassium hydroxide must be varied accordingly to maintain the sensitivity level. The more surfactant, the more concentrated the developer needs to be, i.e. a decrease in sensitivity results as the surfactant concentration is increased. This effect is clearly demonstrated in the Examples that illustrate the invention. For example, for a 0.175 N solution of KOH containing 4 K₂CO₃ a decrease in sensitivity of ca. a factor of 2 results if the concentration of surfactant is increased from 120 ppm to 480 ppm Examples 18 and 19 . Amounts of inorganic salts from about 0.001 to about 20 of the developer in conjunction with the carboxylated surfactant may be used with advantage. The more effective level of the carbonate ranges from 0.1 to 15 . The preferred range is 1 percent to 10 . The concentrations of potassium hydroxide and carboxylated surfactant must be varied accordingly to obtain the desired or maximum sensitivity and contrast for a given carboxylated surfactant and carboxylated surfactant concentration. The more salt, the higher the sensitivity to a point at which the developer begins to attack the unexposed film. Comparison of Examples 19 and 20 shows this effect quite dramatically. For a 0.175 N solution of KOH containing 480 ppm of carboxylated surfactant the sensitivity is increased from 17 mj cm² to 3 mJ cm² as the K₂CO₃ concentration is increased from 4 to 8 . However, a resultant increase in film loss from zero to 1 is also encountered. The alkali metal bases in addition to KOH include NaOH, LiOH, sodium silicate and the like, or compounds which when dissolved in the aqueous developer are capable of providing the equivalent ionic basicity of potassium hydroxide. When using sodium silicate, for example, the ratio of Na₂O to SiO₂ is preferably from 1 1 to 3 1. The amount of alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. when using KOH may vary from about 0.1 to about 10 and preferably in the range of 0.5 to 5 . In addition to potassium carbonate, applicable salts include those that contain the anions CO₃² , PO₄³ , SO₄ ², Cl , Br , NO₃ , borates or silicates and the cations K , Na , Mg² , Li , or H . Reagents capable of generating these ionic species in solution are appropriate provided that the concentration of the base is properly compensated for the amount of base that is neutralized. The amount of salt, e.g. when using the potassium carbonate may vary from 0.1 to about 20 and preferably in the range of 1 to 10 . Concentrations expressed as ppm or percentage values are by weight of the resulting developer solution. The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention further. The enumeration of details in the examples should not be interpreted as limitations except as may be expressed in the appended claims. Parts expressed unless otherwise specifically indicated, are parts by weight based on the weight of the developer.
