## Description
DESCRIPTION IODINE EtRICHED FOOD PRODIJCT This invention relates to an iodine enriched food product which has the effect of improving lipid metabolism by heightening lipoprotein lipase activity, by reducing glycogen consumption, and by improving the constitution ratio of high density lipoptotein in the blood and which also has an anti cancer effect. Americans, as well as Japanese, have been consuming fewer and fewer eggs in recent years. This trend seems to reflect a fear that eating too many eggs may cause heart trouble, a fear based on the theory that maintaining a diet high in cholesterol may increase the amount of serum or hematic cholesterol, which in turn may increase the incidence of coronary artery disease This view seems to prevail despite reports that an ordinary diet with one to three eggs per day for several months makes no significant difference in the average level of blood cholesterol. FEEDSEUFF, August 7, 14, 22 and 24, 1978 . Limiting egg ingestion has never been proved to be an effective means of preventing heart disease but the nutritive value of eggs is well known. However, many recent studies argue that the problem of blood cho1esterol relates not as much to the overall quantity of holesterol as to the kinds of cholesterol and theiJ respective amounts in the blood.The generally accepted view maintains that a high level of low density lipopotein IDL will tend to encourage the development and ziggravation of heart disease, while a high level of higl. density lipoprotein HDL will tend to discourage ito Increasing th level of HDL while lowering the level of LDL is desirable. ingestion of ordinary egg yolk has been found to slightly increase the level of HDL but it also greatly increase the level of IDOL. Nihon University Medical llepartment Bulletin 58, 1979 . A number of diets balancing polyunsaturated and saturated fats, for example have been devised to heighten the level of HDD in order to prevent hyper cholesterolemiaO However, many of these have not proved satisfactory because they require major and difficult changes in the patient s eating habits, The food product of this invention can be ingested easily as an ordinary food in a daily diet and can improve the constitution ratio of HDS in the blood. By constitutor ratio we mean the ratio of HDN cholesterol to total cholesterol0 We have conducted numerous studies on how micronutrients, added to chicken feed, might influence the chemical composition of the egg.We have also studied the effects which different egg compositions have on human diseases e.gO cancer and on lipid metabolism and hematic cholesterol0 We have found that ingestion of eggs containing a high amount of iodine has an anticancer effect and has the effect of heightening lipoprotein lipase activity, of reducing glycogen consumption, and of simultaneously improving the constitution ratio of high density lipoprotein EDIT in the blood Our research has not disclosed any report that any food product containing a high amount of iodine or iodine itself demonstrates the above effects.Our invention, wherefore, may be called a pioneer invention The iodine enriched eggs may be obtained for example in the following manner an iodine compound, and or a seaweed containing a high amount of iodine, or processed products thereof, is mixed in excess of the normal quantity into the feed of egg laying birds e.gO hens or quails. These birds having been fed or dosed with their feed then lay eggs which are high in iodine content0 Iodine compounds which can be used are, for example, calcium iodate potassium iodate sodium iodate potassium iodide sodium iodide cuprous iodide thymol iodide calcium iodobehemate diiode salicylic acid calcium periodate. Examples of seaweed are sea tangle and kelp. Our studies show that, having regard to the health of the bird, chemical stability, and rate of iodine transferability to the egg, calcium iodate is the most desirable iodine compound0 It is even more desirable when the seaweed is added to ito The iodine dosage varies according to the species of egg laying bird. For hens, the dosage is from 5 to 250, preferably from 5 to 15, mg per day per head.For a hen which ingests approximately 100 g of feed per day, the iodine compound should be added to raise the iodine content of the feed for example 50 to 2,500 ppm, preferably 50 to 150 ppm. After approximately one week, the hen begins to produce eggs containing a high level of iodine. Ingesting a feed containing 50 ppm of iodine yields eggs containing approximately 300 rg iodine each and a feed containing 100 ppm of iodine yields eggs containing approximately 600 800 1g each0 By contrast, ordinary egg production requires a feed with 0.30 to 0.35 mg of iodine per kg of feed.According to the American Egg Board, a commercially available feed which contains from 0.3 to 2.0 mg of iodine per kg will produce ordinary eggs containing approximately 6 Xg of iodine each, or at most 30 Fg e8ch. In comparison, the eggs obtained by the methods of this invention contains a particularly high level of iodine. The iodine enriched eggs may be used in their natural, non processed form, They may also be used after being processed, e.gO by heating, drying, concentrating, powdering, or granulating. They may be used for example in the form of granules tablets, or powder mixed with a bonding agent, or in the form of syrup or emulsion. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples.Example 1 Calcium inodate was added to a commercially available feed until its iodine content reached 100 ppm.The feed was fed to hens which has begun to lay eggs three months earlier. After ten days, eggs containing an average of 550 pug iodine per egg were produced.Example 2 Calcium iodate was added to a commerically available feed until its iodine reached 2,000 ppm, and powdered sea tangle was added at the rate of 1 . The feed was fed to 100 hens which had begun to lay eggs seven months earlier, A total of 170 kg of eggs produced by this method were spray dried, whereby 35 kg of dried egg were obtained, This powdered egg had an iodine content of 411 mg per kgo Trample 3 Calcium periodate was added to a commercially available feed to obtain an iodine content of 150 ppm, which resulted in eggs with an average iodine content of 1250 pg each0 The eggs were broken and the contents were increased by 10 with the addition of dextrin and after adding water and blending thoroughly this mixture was spray dried. Example 4 Thymol iodate was added to a commercially available feed to obtain an iodine content of 75 ppm, which resulted in eggs with an average iodine content of 450 rg each which were freeze dried,Example 5 Diiode salicylic acid was added tp a commercially available feed to obtain an iodine content of 100 ppm, ani powdered sea tangle was added at the rate of 1 . This feed resulted in eggs with an average iodine content of 700 rg each0Example 6 Potassium iodate was added to a commercially available hen food so that the iodine content became 75 ppm, resulting in eggs containing on average 450 jig of iodine per egg by the same method as Example 2.The eggs were broken and then freeze dried.Example 7 Sodium iodate was added to a commercially available hen food so that the iodine content became 100 ppm, and powdered seaweed was added at the rate of 0. 550 resulting in eggs containing on average 650 jig of iodine per egg on feeding to egg laying hens as in Example 2. To ascertain the safety of the food product of the invention the following test was conducted.Acute Virulence Test Animals used 10 female rats, Wistar descent, weighing 100 110 g each0 In this test, rats were fed iodine enriched powdered eggs in doses which were increased in geometric ratio to the maximum of 50 mg of iodIne per kg of the rat s weight, After seven days, none of the rats had died or lost weight. The product therefore had no acute virulence, The following animal experiments were then conducted to observe the effect of the food product of the invention in improving the constitution ratio of high density lipprotein KDL in the blood and the anticancer effect of the food product0 Experiment 7 Animals used 30 male rats, SD descent0Three week old rats were placed in cages with a voluntary exercise apparatus. For 10 days they were fed a commercially available solid basic feed.They were fed twice a day between 8 and 9 a.m. and between 9 and 10 p.m. with a powdered basic feed made by Nihon NosanKogyo, K.g. until they were 7 weeks old. They were divided into two groups of 15 each, with the same average weight and performance of voluntary exercise.The first group, designated as the test group, was fed a test feed which had been prepared by adding 2 powdered iodine enriched egg of Example 2 to the powdered basic feed. The second group, designated as the control group, was fed a control feed which has been prepared by adding 2 powdered ordinary egg to the powdered basic feed.Tables 1 and 2 show the composition of egg powders and feed, respectively0 Table 1 Example 2 Powdered Egg Ordinary Powdered Egg t Moisture 4.2 3.6 t Crude Protein 48.5 49.6 t Crude Fat 40.9 40.3 t Crude Ash 3.9 4.5 t Calcium 0.25 0.25 Phbsphorus 0.88 Potassium 0.52 0.52 Magnesium 0.19 0.19 mg lodine kg. 411.0 3.0 Table 2 Test Group Control Group Moisture 11.8 11.1 t Crude Protein 19.3 19.4 Crude Fat 4.8 4.9 t Crude Fiber 6.3 6.7 t Crude Ash 6.0 q 6.1 6,9 Protein 100 9 816.3 36.9 The temperature in each feeding cage was maintained at 250 20C and humidity, between 50 and 80 . The amount of each feed ingested was measured for three days per week, and each rat was weighed twice per week.The rats were fed in this manner for 10 weeks and then were decapitated some at 5 p.m., some at 9 p.m., some at 12 a.m., or before, during and after feed ingestion to measure the following lipoprotein lipase activity in the adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity in the skeletal muscles glycogen level in the liver glycogen level in the skeletal muscles total amount of whole blood cholesterol amount of hematic high density lipoprotein ED and constitution ratio of hematic HDL. Although there was little difference between the test group and the control group with respect to the amount of feed ingestion and weight increase Table 3 , the amount of voluntary exercise of the test group was consistently higher than that of the control group.

Continued ingestion of the food product is desirable because it does not produce immediate effects. The product does not cause any ill side effects, and it is superior to ordinary eggs in its nutritive value, When one or two eggs with an iodine content of 300 to 1,000 pg per egg are ingested as a part of one s daily diet, the intended improvement begins to show in approximately one month, This is accomplished without abnormally upsetting the constitution ratio of the hematic lipoproteins.Experiment 3 Animals used Mice, ddy descent Sex Male Number 72 heads Three week old mice were divided into two groups of 36 namely, a test group and a control group. The test group mice were fed with a feed, which was prepared by adding the iodine enriched powdered egg of Example 1 to a powdered commercially available basic feed at the rate of 5v On the other hand, the control group mice were fed with a feed, which was prepared by adding the ordinary powdered egg shown in the right column of Table 1 to the powdered basic feed at the rate of 5 . The mice of the test and control groups were fed up to six weeks old Thereafter, the test group mice were divided into three minor groups of 12, and the control group mice were also divided into three minor groups of 12 Sarcoma 180 of 5 x 10 0.2 ml was transplanted or grafted to the abdominal cavity of mice belonging to the first minor groups of the test and control groups. Sarcoma 180 of 5 x 103 0.2 ml was transplanted to the abdominal cavity of mice belonging to the second minor groups of the test and control groups, and Sarcoma 180 of 5 x 104 0.2 ml was also transplanted to the abdominal cavity of mice belonging to the third minor groups of the test and control groups. After such transplantations, the mice of the test and control groups were fed with the respective feeds, and observed for 60 days. The result of such observation is shown in Table 9.The effect of life prolongation was proved with respect to the mice ingesting the feed to which the product of the present invention was added.
