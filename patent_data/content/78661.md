# Method and apparatus for increasing the efficiency of internal collection filter bags.

## Abstract
One or more hollow tubular air channeling members 31, 31 are positioned in the interior of an internal collection type filter bag 20 to separate the incoming dirty air into a plurality of portions essentially confined from each other and to direct these separated and confined portions of dirty air to different interior portions of the filter bag and thereby increase the effective filtering efficiency of the filter bag and also increase useful bag life.
