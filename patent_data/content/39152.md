# Editing apparatus for recorded signals.

## Abstract
An error detection arrangement for editing apparatus for use with video tape recorders, wherein different signals on a first record medium 204 , are transferred to a second medium 206 , and wherein the relative positions of the media are represented by position data. The apparatus comprises a con sole 202 having a plurality of display registers of register selector switches of register indicators of signal selector switches, of signal select indicators, and control switches operable to initiate edit operations. A central processing unit 208 responds to the selected operation for assigning at least one of the different signals for transfer to the second medium when this reaches a relative position represented by the data displayed in a register. The central processing unit includes an error detector to detect if the data displayed in the register is enabling for carrying out the edit operation and, if not, to inhibit the operation from being carried out and to actuate selected ones of the indicators to apprise an error condition.
