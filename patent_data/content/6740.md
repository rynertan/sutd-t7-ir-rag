# Improvements in strain gauges.

## Abstract
A strain gauge element 10 having an elastic beam 11 with field effect transistors 13, 14, 15, 16 deposited on one surface arranged in a Wheatstone bridge so that deformation of the beam 11 produces a proportional imbalance signal across the bridge, and means for apply ing a gate biasing voltage
