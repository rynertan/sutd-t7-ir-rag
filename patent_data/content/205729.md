# Gas laser having thermally stable optical mount.

## Abstract
A laser of the flowing gas type employs an optical resonator having mirrors at each end of the lasing region which are supported, without a separate optical bench, by a hollow cylindrical gas tight housing. Enclosed in the hous ing are a pump for circulating the gas, electrodes for caus ing lasing of the flowing gas, and heat exchangers for cool ing the gas. Those enclosed structures are subject to ther mal expansion and contraction and are hung between a pair of plates. One of those plates is affixed to one end of the housing while the other plate is free to move within the housing so that thermal expansion and contraction of the enclosed structures does not place an appreciable stress on the housing. A heat shield is disposed between the hung structures and the inside wall of the housing to provide a barrier to the transmission of heat to the housing and the housing is liquid cooled to stabilize its temperature. The mirrors of the optical resonator are mounted on rings attached to each end of the housing. Apertures are provided in the plates to provide windows for the passage of light reflected between the mirrors of the optical resonator. At least one of the mirrors is mounted so that its alignment can be adjusted without opening the gas tight housing.
