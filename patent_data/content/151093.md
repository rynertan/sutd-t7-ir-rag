# An unpierceable air tube, particularly for bicycles, motorbicycles and motorcycles.

## Abstract
An air tube is disclosed wherein the structure of the air tube is such that upon inflating the air tube, supply sources of air under pressure are caused to form between the outer surface of the air tube and the inner surface of an associated cover. These supplies of air under pressure are designed to act so that when a sharp pointed object such as, for example, a nail pierces through the cover and causes the inflated air tube to slightly move aside so as to separate it from the cover, the air aupplies are sucked into this separation area to create a deep air pocket therein which permits the air tube to be maintained spaced apart from the point of the nail having passes through the cover. Also disclosed is a mix from which the air tube is obtainable, the mix having a particular composition which is such as to give the air tube the required elastic and strength properties.

## Description
AN UNPIERCEABLE AIR T IBE, PARTICULARLY FOR BICYCLES, MOTORBICYCLES AND MOTORCYCLES This invention relates to tire air tubes for vehicles in general but particularly for bicycles, motorized bicycles and motorcycles, and more particularly to an air tube of a novel design which is characterized in that it is of a substantially unpierceable construction. As known, an air tube is a tore shaped, thin walled rubber tube having a very good airtight property, which is inflated to a desired pressure by iiltro ducing air into it. through a valve means. The surface of said robber ibE is usually smooth ill order t.o Ive able to make a close contact with the inner surface of a cover forming a strong casing for the air tube. A most serious disadvantage of presently wised air tubes is their liability to puncturing. In f. ct, if a sharp pointed object such as, foe example, a nail pierces through an air tube cover to come into contact with the inflated air tube, this air tube will first be moved apart from the inner surface of its associated cover and then, upon an elastic limit being exceeded, it is punctured as a result of which it becomes deflated. It is an object of this invention to overcome the above disadvantage by providing an air tube which is of a substantially unpierceable nature at leat against the most usual sharp pointed objects that are likely to exert such a piercing effect thereupon. More particularly, the invention provides a tire air tube for vehicles, especially of the bicycle, motor bicycle and motorcycle type, characterized by a structure which is designed so that, when under infla ted condition, it provides for supply sources of air under pressure to be available between the outer sirface of the air tube and the inner surface of an associated cover, said supplies of air under pressure being such that, when a puncturing object havin ej e trated through the cover causes the air tube to be slightly moved away and, thus, separated from said cover, the air supplies are sucked into this separation area to form an air pocket therein wliidi will maillt the airtube spaced apart from the point of the piercillg object that has penetrated the cover thereby to prevent the air tube from being punctured. Said supply sources of air under pressure are preferably created at least at that region of the air tube which corresponds to a tire tread region. According to a feature of this invention, said pressurized air supplies are obtained in that the structure of the air tube wall is corrugated in a circumferential direction thereof so that the air tube will show longitudinal crests and grooves extending parallel to one another throughout the length of the torus formed by the air tube, the air enclosed in each of sucli grooves being caused to be compressed when inflating the air tube. According to another feature of the invention, said pressurized air supplies are obtained by the structure of the air tube wall being corrugated in a longitudinal direction so that the air tube will show circumferential crests and grooves formed thereon extending parallel to one another along the air tube, the air iii each of such grooves being caused to be compressed when inflating the air tube. A further feature of the invention resides ilx the critical composition of the mix employed for producing the above described air tube with the required elastic and strength properties. One preferred composition for said mix is as follows White libber, 90.5 Active zinc oxide, 1. Sulfur, 2.3 D.M.accelerator, 0.8 n accelerator, H 0.1 Yellow ozocerite, f 3.0 Stearin, a, 1.0 Antioxidant aldol, 0.5 The invention will now be described in more details with reference to the accompanying drawings which show, by way of non restrictive examples, some preferred embodiments thereof, and in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a portion of air tube according to a first embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a view similar to figure 1 showing a portion of air tube according to another embodiment of the invention Figure 3 is a partial cross sectional view through an inflated air tube mounted in an associated cover and Figure 4 is a partial cross sectional view similar to figure 3, showing the behaviour of the air tube ripon a nail having passed through the cover. With reference first to figure 1, there is generally indicated with 10 a portion of an air tube according tithis invention. This air tube portion 10 has a thin wall 11 having a structure that is of corrugated cross sectional shape, said strtletllre forming crests 12 and grooves 13 parallel to one another extending in a direction longitudinal of the air tube along the length of the tore shape thereof. The grooves 13 are designed so that , when the air tribe is inflated in an associated cover, these grooves cause compressed air supplies to be formed between the upper surface of the air tube and the lower surface of the cover for a purpose to be explained herein below in relation to figures 3 and 4. In figure 2 there is generally shown at 20 an air tube portion having a thin wall 21 the longitudinal crosssection of which has a corrugated structure forming crests 22 and grooves 23 extending in a direction circumferential of the air tube throughout the length thereof. The grooves 23 are designed so that, when the air tube is inflated inside the associated cover, the grooves case compressed air supplies to be formed between the upper surface of the air tube and the lower surface of the cover. r igi re 3 is a cross sectional view taken through a cover 30 and the associated inflated air tube 10. When inflating the air tube inside the cover 30, the air in grooves 13a, 13b, 13c, 13d and 13e is compressed so as to form supply sources of air under pressure therein, while the crests 12a, 12b, 12c and 12d, that are in close contact with the cover, define said grooves laterally. Figures 4 is a cross sectional view similar toFigure 3 but showing the behaviour of the air tube 10 in the case when a nail 40 punctures the cover 30. In this case, when the point of the nail 40 comes into contact with the air tube it firstly exerts a pushing action thereupon causing the air tube to move away at that location from its cover 30 so that the grooves 13c, in the example shown,will communicate laterally, at that region, with one or each of the two adjacent grooves such as, forexample, the grooves 13b and 13d. Then, air under pressure contained in groove 13c and the, or each adjacent grooves 13b and or 13d will flow 1Lotrhce into the thus formed pocket T and this will deform by pressure balance into a deeper pocket S. Tn tllis deeper pocket S the point of the nail will no longer touch the air tube so that puncturing of this latter is prevented. Though the exact mechanism of this phenomenon is not perfectly known, it has been surprisingly found by experiments that said deep air pocket is really formed and it seems to the Applicant that what has been stated above may be considered as the most obvious explanation of the described phenomenon. As an aid in achieving the novel air tube struc ture of the invention, there has also been developed according to the invention a preferred mix composition for manufacturing the novel air tube, which composition gives the air tube the required elastic and strength properties atid allows for the above described phenomenon to take place. Among the many types of mix that have been tested, it has been found that for the most successful results to be attained, a mix having the following composition should be employed White rubber, 90.5 Active zinc oxide, M 1.8 Sulphur, 2.3 fl.M.accelerator, 0.8 n Accelercttor, f Yellow ozocerite, 3.0 Stearin, ç 1.0 Antioxidant aldol, V,, 0.5 The air tube of the invention is formed by curing it in a conventional manner on aluminium pipe or rod shaped sun porting means the outer surface of which has the same shape as that of the air tube structure to be obtained, by employing processes that are known in the art, the cured air tube being then removed from the pipe or rod shaped supporting means and treated in a usual manner until the two ends thereof are joined together to give the air tube its final tore shape. It has been found through experiments that the air tube of the invention is unpierceable by nails up to 1,5 to 2 cm in length which largely fall within the class of these sharp pointed objects by which commercially available types of air tubes are likely to be priiictured. While one preferred embodiment of the invention, and one modification thereof, have been disclosed above and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, it has to be intended that the teachings of the invention would also be applied to other types of air tube without departing from the spirit and scope of the inventive principle which essentially resides in causing supply sources of air under pressure to be created with the purpose of compensating for the lower pressure that is produced at a puncturing area, namely an area where a separation of the air tube from an associated cover has occurred as a result of a sharp pointed object having pierced ttlroz the cover to be brought into contact with the air tube.
