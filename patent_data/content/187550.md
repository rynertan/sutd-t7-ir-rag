# Simultaneous extrusion of multiple streams of a fibrous food product.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the simultaneous extrusion from an extrusion discharge station 20 of multiple streams of a food product having fibers therein, from a single mass of the food product, where the desired product spacing between the streams at the extrusion discharge station 20 is less then the greatest expected fiber length. Converging extrusion channels 38 communicate at a channel entry station 31 with a feed container 16 which holds and directs the flow of the mass of food product, and the distance of closest spacing between the extrusion channels at the channel entry station 35 is greater than the average expected fiber length. Bridging of food fibers between adjacent extrusion channels 38 at the entry station 31 is avoided by the large channel entry spacing, while the decreasing distance between the converging channels allows the food product streams at the extrusion discharge station 20 to be spaced at a desired product spacing less then the greatest expected fiber length. Uniform flow of the food mass into the channel entry station 31 is promoted by the use of a converging diverging flow path in the feed container.
