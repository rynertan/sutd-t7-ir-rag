# Print head control system with controlled acceleration and deceleration.

## Abstract
In a control system for a bidirectional printer capable of printing at different speeds on different lines, stored values representing the ideal velocities during the acceleration and deceleration of the print carriage for each direction and speed are compared with the actual values in a processor 28 and any resulting difference is used to move the carriage velocity toward the ideal value.
