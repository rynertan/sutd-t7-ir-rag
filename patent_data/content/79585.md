# Thermal printhead.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a thermal printhead comprising an insula ting substrate, a heat generating resistor layer formed on the substrate and means for supplying the heat generating resistor layer with electric current. The heat generating resistor layer is made of Cr Si SiO alloy, the Cr, Si and O contents falling within a region defined by points A, B, C and D in a triangular diagram, where the points A, B, C and D are determined as follows
