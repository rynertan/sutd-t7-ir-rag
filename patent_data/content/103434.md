# AN OUTRIGGER BEAM ASSEMBLY FOR A VEHICLE AND A METHOD FOR STABILISING A VEHICLE

## Abstract
An outrigger beam assembly for stabilizing a large con struction vehicle 5 includes two pivotally connected por tions. Mounted to an outer end of a single stage outrigger beam 30 is an extension beam 40 with selectively removable pins 60 securing the extension beam 40 to the outrigger beam 30 . When a vertically aligned pair of pins 60 are removed, the extension beam 40 may be manually pivoted, around a vertical hinge axis passing through the remaining pins 60 , from a working position to a non working or storage position. Either a locking bar 80 or cooperating apertured ear portions on the extension beam 40 and the outrigger beam 30 may be used to secure the extension beam 40 in the storage position.
