# Polyalkylene oxide having unsaturated end group and narrow molecular weight distribution.

## Abstract
A polyalkylene oxide having unsaturated end groups. The polymer has a distribution of molecular weight Mw Mn of not more than 1.5, and a process for the same. The polymer is useful as rubber materials, and can provide cured rubber having an excellent elongation.
