# Control system for hydraulically operated elements or systems.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for controlling the operation of two separately operable hydraulic arrangements such as elements, units circuits or systems, and in particular the winches 1P, 1S for the warps 2P, 2S of a trawl by monitoring the pressure conditions in the arrangements i.e. warps by transducers 45P, 45S establishing reference pressures 57 for the primary operating conditions of the arrangements and comparing these reference pressures with the values obtained from monitoring in a comparator 54 and producing control signals which are use to vary the operation conditions of the arrangements to equalise them to the reference values. Provision is made for overall control by a microprocessor 55 to allow the system to deal with obstructions and to provide alarms and safety conditions when necessary
