# Method of determining the density distribution of an original and of copying the same.

## Abstract
A method of discriminating an image which comprises scanning an original image by a photoelectric conversion device, quantizing of an image signal obtained through the pho toelectric conversion device, preparing a density histogram corresponding to said quan tized image signal, detecting a peak density value corresponding to the peak present on the low density side of said density histogram, and a density width of said density histogram, and discrim inating said original image according to both said peak den sity value and said density width.
