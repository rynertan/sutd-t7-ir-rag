## Description
BACKGROUND OF THIS INVENTION This invention relates to solids, such as, pigments encapsulated with a polymer, and methods of preparing and using such. BROAD DESCRIPTION OF THIS INVENTION An object of this invention is to provide polymerencapsulated dispersed non monomer solids, such as, polymer encapsulated pigments. Another object of this invention is to provide a process of preparing such polymer encapsulated dispersed solids, such as, polymer encapsulated pigments. A further object of this invention is to provide uses for such polymer encapsulated dispersed solids e.g., polymer encapsulated pigments and compositions containing such polymer encapsulated dispersed solids e.g., polymer encapsulated pigments . Other objects and advantages of this invention are set out herein or are obvious herefrom to one ordinarily skilled in the art. The objects and advantages of this invention are achieved by the polymer encapsulated dispersed solids, such as, polymer encapsulated pigments, methods and products of this invention. This invention broadly involves a simple process for preparing uniformly polymer encapsulated dispersed non monomer solids. The process includes admixing water, a finely divided solid, a nonionic protective colloid or stabilizing agent, and all or a portion of a nonionic monomer having at least one monovalent unsaturated organo moiety in a reactor. The solid has a minimum of surface charge. A nonionic polymerization initiator is added to the admixture and the admixture is heated to begin the polymerization of the nonionic monomer. A nonionic catalyst and any remainder of the nonionic monomer is added to the admixture. The polymerization is allowed to proceed to finality or the desired degree. A high molecular weight polymer is preferred, but low molecular weight polymers can be used. A polymer encapsulated solid dispersion is obtained.The novel system of this invention, however, must be primarily nonionic. This invention involves a preferred, simple process for preparing uniformly polymer encapsulated pigments. The process includes admixing water, finely divided pigment, a nonionic protective colloid or stabili ing agent, and all or a portion of a nonionic monomer having at least one monovalent unsaturated organo moiety in a reactor. The pigment has a minimum of surface charge. A nonionic polymerization initiator is added to the admixture and the admixture is heated to begin the polymerization of the nonionic monomer. A nonionic catalyst and any remainder of the nonionic monomer is added to the admixture. The polymerization is allowed to proceed to finality or the desired degree. A high molecular weight polymer is preferred, but low molecular weight polymers can be used. A polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion is obtained.The prior art shows precipitating polymers from a solvent monomer system onto the pigment. The system must be primarily non ionic. The product might be termed plastic pigments or opaque polymers . The process of this invention for preparing the polymerencapsulated solids such as pigments of this invention involves emulsion polymerization. The process is analogous to some latex processes. Advantageously the process is simple and versatile, can use conventional latex reactors, has short reduced reaction times, and involves good heat transfer. Reaction time to a given total solids is reduced by virtue of the pre formed particle core less monomer to react . A pre dispersion step may be required for hard to disperse pigments such as some TiO2 and CaCO3 unless these can be purchased in an acceptable slurry form. Through emulsion polymerization, pigments can be microencapsulated by utilizing the following processes 1.Dispersing Monomer This process embodiment utilizes a monomer that functions as a dispersant or partial dispersant for the pigment and yet copolymerizes readily with subsequent monomer feeds. Vinyl pyrrolidone is such a monomer, but it is limited to use with pigments having hydrophilic surfaces. For example, CaCO3 and TiO2 of the type TiPure R 931 cannot readily be encapsulated with vinyl pyrrolidone as the initiating monomer. Or, in other words, certain monomers such as N vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl acetate and butyl acrylate, serve both as the monomer forming the encapsulating polymer and as the dispersing monomer. 2. Surfactant Graft This process embodiment necessitates the use of a nonionic surfactant with a long ethylene oxide chain. Igepal CO 990 nonyl phenol lOO mols ethyleneoxide, EO functions in this respect. In this technique, the hydrophilic portion of the soap EO is apparently attracted to the pigment surface and apparently either behaves as the polymerization locus or graft occurs across the tert. hydrogen in the nonyl group. This system permits encapsulation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic type pigments however, the particle size of the pigment to be encapsulated is generally limited to the approximate size of the EO chains. With either process embodiment, surface charge on the pigment must be minimal and inclusion of any substantial amount of anionic component surfactant, catalyst, monomeric acid, etc. in the initial stages of polymerization will substantially or totally inhibit encapsulation. Polymer control techniques, such as, staged polymerization, for example, core shell, can be used. Some of the key elements of this invention emulsion polymerization process for the preparation of the invention polymer encapsulated pigments are the use of 1 nonionic surfactants, 2 catalysts that leave a minimum of ionic residues in the polymer, and 3 the proper type of grade of pigment. Any suitable vinyl monomer can be used to form the encapsulating vinyl polymer, but preferably vinyl acetate or alkyl acrylates are used. Encapsulatidn is shown by film appearance and performance gloss, scrub, etc. , stability, behavior in the reactor absence of flocculation and incompatability with conventional paints, and through microphotographs. This invention also includes the polymer encapsulated dispersed non monomer solids and the preferred polymer encapsulated pigments. The polymer encapsulated solids or pigments of this invention are best described as a solids or pigment dispersion. A dispersion is an apparently homogeneous substance which consists of a microscopically heterogeneous mixture of two or more finely divided phases. The polymer encapsulated pigments can be formulated into paints, producing unusually good appearance properties for the paint.The unique pigment disper6ions of the invention are often more stable than the pigment scurries used in the paint industry today. The polymer encapsulated pigments are useful in the preparation of paints or other coating materials, and represent stable paint coating intermediates. The polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion is film forming dependent on the typical emulsion polymer parameters of glass transition Tg and minimum filming temperatures MFT . The films frequently show better appearance properties, such as, gloss, distinctness of image and hiding, than do conventional dispersions. In one sense, the polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions can be viewed as pre paints. The polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions of this invention, as compared to prior art coatings, can provide better economics, gloss, hiding power, open time, modulus, scrub resistance, color stability and durability. The encapsulated pigments function both as binder and pigment.This invention eliminates dispersion steps and equipment in preparing paints and coatings. The polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions can be used in trade paints e.g., gloss semi gloss, exterior house paints and interior flats , pigment slurries, paper coatings, roof coatings, caulks, adhesives, industrial coatings, and textiles.In addition to paints, there are other related applications for coatings and adhesives containing such polymer encapsulated pigments. The coatings, paints, adhesives, etc., are composed of the normal non pigment components of such coatings, paints, adhesives, etc., plus the polymer encapsulated pigments of this invention. The polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions themselves are pigment slurries that can be used wherever slurries are used.There is reasonable stability at polymer contents as low as 10 percent based on the pigment taken as 100 percent. At the 9 1 pigment polymerratio using clay or calcium carbonate, one has a model for a typical coating color for paper coating applications. Encapsulated mica for example dispersions can be used in latex roof coatings to improve their resistance to water swelling and or water permeability, and in latex caulks. Latex adhesives, e.g., clay filled boxboard adhesives, can be achieved by utilizing a soft polymer encapsulation layer. Industrial coatings or baking enamels are other useful areas an oven dried sample of polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion was prepared and examined, and the visual appearance of the gloss was strikingly excellent versus typical latex enamels.Textile binding or coating systems are useful areas by analogy to the paint, adhesive and paper coatings previously cited. There are many uses for the polymer encapsulated dispersed non monomer insoluble solids of this invention. The best and preferred results have been obtained using polymer encapsulated titanium dioxide in paints and polymer encapsulated calcium carbonate in paper coatings.Normal coating grades of TiO2 are difficult to control adverse effects from organic and non uniform inorganic treatments , so untreated, pure TiO2 is preferred and cheaper. Inert pigments are preferably used, but at least some reactive pigments can be encapsulated. Basically, the titanium dioxide TiO2 is encapsulated with vinyl acetate and or acrylates with nonionic surfactants and or poly vinyl pyrrolidone or vinyl pyrrolidone monomer as stabilizers and redox catalysts. in one scheme, first there is the dispersing of the pigment, monomer, water, stabilizing agents and followed by the adding of the catalysts. So the encapsulations include polymer plus possibly catalysts and stabilizing agent or nonionic surfactant. The pigments basically should be pure pigments which have not been surface treated as the invention process may not succeed in encapsulating surface treated pigments. Also, as absorbed oxygen on the surface of the pigment particles causes some inhibition of pigment encapsulation, such condition should be avoided. Another preferred embodiment of the invention process involves the preparation of the encapsulation admixture before any nonionic polymerization initiator and nonionic catalyst have been added. First, a finely divided solid and a nonionic protective colloid or stabilizing agent plus water are admixed. Then all or a portion of a nonionic monomer is added to such admixture. Example 17 shows that a minor amount of initiator and reducer can be added to such admixture before the monomer is added.

A pigment is a substance that imparts color, including black or white, to other materials. Pigments are generally considered to be insoluble in the medium vehicle in which they are applied. This invention does not include dyestuffs dyes , which are soluble in the medium in which they are applied. Pigments generally have the property of light refractivity, whereas dyes generally only have the property of light absorption. This invention includes inorganic pigments and organic pigments. Pigments are used as finely ground or particulated solid particles. As used herein and in the art, the term pigment includes phosphorescent, luminescent, fluorescent, metalescent and pearlescent materials. The pigment must be in particle form and should have a mean particle size between 0.1 and 100 jim and preferably between 0.2 and 50 jim.

A more generalized list of organic and inorganic pigments which can be used in this invention includes iron oxide red, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, chrome yellow, carbon black, chrome orange, chrome green, zinc chromate, red lead, the lakes, azo type toners, phthalocyanines, aluminum hydrates, lakes, iron oxide, white lead, titanium containing pigments, calcium carbonate, aluminum oxide, ultraphone, lead chromate, cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, barium sulfate, azo pigments, anthraquinone and vat pigments, acrylamino yellow, magnesium oxide , chrome red, antimony oxide, zinc sulfide, magnesium fluoride and ground barytes. Benzoid pigments are useful and examples thereof are toners and lakes.Examples of benzoic toners are yellow tones, e.g., benoid yellows and Hansa yellow orange toners, e.g., vat orange 3 red toners, e.g., napthol reds violet toners blue toners green toners brown toners and black toners.Examples of benzoic lakes are yellow lakes, e.g., acid yellow 2 orange lakes red lakes violet lakes blue lakes, e.g., acid blue 93 green lakes brown lakes and black lakes e.g., natural black 3. Metallic pigments can be used, and an example thereof is aluminum flakes. Mixtures of pigments can be used. Note that reactive pigments such asZnO can be used. An extender is a substance, usually an inert material, which is added to paint to give it extra body, key or opacity, or to serve as an adulterating medium. The invention includes the polymer encapsulation of extenders. Examples of suitable extenders also termed inert white pigments or transparent white pigments or fillers are talc 3M90 4Si02 H20 , chalk CaC03 , barytes BaSOI , barium carbonate BaCO3 , aluminum hydrate A1 OH 3 , mica, diatomaceous earth SiO2 , aluminum stearate lAl C18H3502 3 , gypsum CaSO4.2B20 , anhydrite CaSO4 , silica quarts six2 , kaolinite Al203 25i02 2H20 and other clay and silica fillers. Mixtures of pigments and or extenders can be used. For specific pigments the advantages are a TiO2 Increased hiding power with reduced pigment level. This must occur because drying forces induce reagglomeration, loss of surface area and loss of hide. A pigment particle surrounded by a plastic barrier cannot reagglomerate. b Calcined Clays This family can be encapsulated without filling the pigment void with encapsulating polymer, so both dry and wet hide can be achieved at a fraction of the cost of prime pigments without the negatives encountered in current microvoid technology no wet hide, dirt stain pick up, gloss restrictions, etc. . c Color pigments Probably the paint chemists number one headache. Encapsulated color pigments should eliminate problems of color development, color acceptance rub up , floating, flooding, etc. The non monomer solids are those which are insoluble in the medium vehicle in which they are applied. The non monomer solids can be organic or inorganic. Water that is contained in the initial charge can readily be varied over the range of 4 6 to 7 3 water total solids ratio, wherein such total solids are equal to the monomer and the non monomer solids pigment content. The water is not a solvent in the invention as the pigment, monomer, etc., are insoluble therein. The water serves as a heat control mechanism and forms the liquid phase of an emulsion. Minor amounts up to say 10 percent of non aqueous liquids can be used in conjunction with the water. Examples of such non aqueous liquids are alcohols, such as, methanol, ethanol, n propyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol, amy alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, sec butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol and 4 methyl 2 pentanol ethers, such as, ethyl ether, diethyl Cellosolve and butyl ether and aldehydes, such as, benzaldehyde and furfural. The most preferred stabilizing agent or protective colloid is T Det N 1007 Thompson Hayward , a 100 mole ethoxylate of nonyl phenol. CELLOSIZE, poly vinyl pyrrolidone , and poly vinyl alcohol typically can be used either alone or in combination with the T Det N 1007. Preferred stabilizing agent concentrations are 0.5 to 4.5 parts based on the solids monomer plus pigment . With high surface area pigments, up to 10 parts based on the total solids may be required. In some cases, monomer alone is sufficiently surface active to effect dispersion of the pigment or non monomer solids and the encapsulated polymer can still maintain a stable dispersion. Examples have included vinyl acetate or N vinyl pyrrolidone V Pyrol ofGAF . The presence of anionic surfactants as a wetting or stabilizing agent is very detrimental to the stability of the dispersion. Generally, a system which effectively forms an excellent initial dispersion of the pigment is favored but several cases have been seen where dispersion seems to improve during the initial stages of polymer formation. Oligomeric forms of the polymer or its grafts are suspected of contributing to the degree of dispersion and its stabilization analogously to similar processes frequently postulated for conventional latex polymerizations. Pigment or non monomer solids to monomer ratios at 9 1 to 1 9 are preferred. Carboxylated polymer layers can be formed if comonomers, such asr acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, are added at the final stages of the process. In this case, the anionic character of such carboxylic monomers appears to be weakened by the preformation of the polymer layer. Also, anionic surfactants can be added at the completion of the encapsulation without causing destabilization of the dispersion. Polymerization temperatures over the range of 100 to 850C are preferred. A variety of latex type processes can be employed. Preferably monomer 5 to 10 percent of the total monomer is initially added, followed by a monomer feed.Other processes which can be used in this invention include 1 adiabatic systems in which all of the monomer is charged, followed by the catalyst, 2 staged fed systems or staged adiabatic systems, and 3 core shell type systems where different monomers are sequentially fed or adiabatically reacted or in which staged polymerization processes are employed. The preferred monomers include vinyl acetate, the butyl, ethyl, 2 ethylhexyl and isobutyl acrylate esters, styrene, acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, and vinyl pyrrolidone. The normal relationships seen in emulsion polymerization appear to prevail, e.g., styrene vinyl acetate copolymers will not form readily. Even vinyl isobutyl ether is useful in a copolymer.The principles applicable to conventional emulsion polymerization can be applied as long as care is taken to keep the system as nonionic as is reasonable in the initial steps. A pigment should have good dispersing properties and should be uniformly distributed throughout the surface regions or the entire mass to be pigmented, as desired.Since the pigment or solids is highly dispersed in a polymerencapsulated pigment or solids dispersion such behavior eliminates or minimizes the separate task of dispersion of the pigment or solids . This invention includes the use of at least one nonionic surfactant or wetting agent. Non ionic surfactants have essentially no charge when dissolved or dispersed in aqueous media. The hydrophilic tendency of nonionic surfactants is primarily due to oxygen in the molecule which hydrates by hydrogen bonding to water molecules. The strongest hydrophilic moieties in nonionic surfactants are ether linkages and hydroxyl groups, but the hydrophilic ester and amide linkages are present in many nonionic surfactants. The commercially available nonionic surfactants include ethoxylated alkylphenols, ethoxylated aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic esters, caraboxylic amides, and polyoxyalkylene oxide block copolymers such are useful within the scope of this invention. Nonionic ethoxylated allkylphenols usually are C8 to C1 members or derivatives thereof, such as, nonylphenoxypoly ethyleneoxy ethanols, dodecylphenoxypoly ethyleneoxy ethanols, and octylphenoxypoly ethyleneoxy ethanols. Examples of useful nonionic ethoxylated alkylphenols or more specifically alkylphenoxypoly ethyleneoxy ethanols, with the alkyl groups designated in some instances are Advice 50,Advawet, Agrimul 70A, Atkaflo E, Brites EOC 10 nonyl ,Carboxane DO.

Above, EG is ethylene glycol,DEG is diethylene glycol and PG is propylene glycol.Examples of useful ethoxylated natural fats, oils and waxes that are nonionic surfactants are the ethoxylated castor oils. Nonionic surfactants include carboxylic amides, such as, diethanolamine condensates monoethanolamine condensates and isopropanolamine condensates. Examples of useful nonionic diethanolamides of fatty acids are the diethanolamides of coco, lauric, oleic, myristic, stearic and ricinoleic acids.Examples of useful nonionic monoalkanolamides of fatty acids are those of lauric, coco, oleic and stearic acids, with the amine moiety being that of ethanol or isopropanol. Non ironic surfactants also include non ionic polyoxyethylene fatty acid amides, for example, of coco, lauric and oleic acids. Nonionic surfactants include polyalkylene oxide block copolymers such as Tergitol XH and XD polyoxypropylene polyxyethylene of Union CarbideCorporation, and polysiloxane polyoxyalkylene copolymers such as L 520 of Union Carbide Corporation. The initiator or catalyst systems appear to be critical to a successful polymer encapsulated pigment or non monomer solid . The most preferred system is t butyl hydroperoxide with sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate a Redox system . Bydrogen peroxide sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate and hydrogen peroxide ferrous ion systems are preferred. All attempts so far to use thermal potassium or ammonium persulfate or a redox system of potassium persulfate sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate system have resulted in destabilization. Apparently the anionic character of such systems somehow interferes with the encapsulation as do anionic surfactants. The initiator can be a free radical initiator. The preferred free radical initiators are the peroxides.Examples of useful peroxides are the dialkyl peroxides, such as, di t butyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, decanoyl peroxide, 2 methyipentanoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di t butylperoxy hexane and 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di t butylperoxy hexyne 3 the diaryl peroxides, such as, benzoyl peroxide the alkaryl peroxides, such as, dicumyl peroxide the suifonyl peroxides, such as, acetyl cyclohexylsulfonyl peroxide and acetyl sec heptylsulfonyl peroxide the peresters, such as, t butyl perbenzoate, t butyl peroxyneodecanoate, t butyl peroxypivalate, 1,1,3, 3 tetramethylbutyl peroxy 2 ethylhexanoate, 2,5 dimethyi 215 bis 2 ethylhexanoylperoxy hexane, t butyl peroxy 2ethyl hexanoate, t butyl peroxyisobutyrate, t butyl peroxymaleic acid, OO t butyi O isopropyl monoperoxycarbonate, 2 ,5 dimethyl 2, 5 bis benzoylperoxy hexane, t butyl peracetate and di t butyl diperoxyphthalate the peroxydicarbonates, such as, di isopropyl peroxydicarbonate, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, di secbutyl peroxydicarbonate, di 2 ethylhexyl peroxydicarbonate, dicyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate and dibenzyl peroxydicarbonate the organometallic peroxides, such as, vinyl tris t butyl peroxy silane the hydroperoxides, such as, t butyl hydroperoxide and cumyl hydroperoxide, 1,1,3,3 tetramethylbutyl hydroperoxide and 2,5 dihydroperoxy 2,5 dimethylhexane and the azo compounds, such as 212 azobis isobutyronitrile and 2,2 a obis 2,4 dimethylvaleronitrile . The polymer encapsulated pigment or non monomer solid dispersions of the invention are stable and there is no separation when centrifuged. During the preparation of the polymer encapsulated pigments or non monomer solids of the invention, high speed agitation for example, a circulation number per minute of the dispersion of 3 or more has the disadvantage of causing foaming. The invention provides water based dispersion coatings obtained from nonionic systems. Except as qualified above, water soluble monomers such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid are not operable as the nonionic monomer within the scope of the invention process.

The following examples are illustrative of the invention. As used herein, all parts, percentages, ratios and proportions are on a weight basis unless otherwise stated herein or obvious herefrom to one ordinarily skilled in the art. EXAMPLE1 A finely divided precipitated CaCO3 was encapsulated with a copolymer of vinyl acetate and n butyl acrylate 80 20 , which was similar to a typical commercial or trade sales latex copolymer. The pigment to resin ratio was 25 to 75. A nonionic surfactant and a nonionic initiator and nonionic catalyst redox system was used. A shadowed photomicrograph was made and the presence of CaCO3 in the particles was confirmed by EDAX definition. EXAMPLE 2 A physical blend of particles of a latex RhoplexAC 388 and a talc Nytal 300 at a 4 to 1 ratio of polymer to pigment was prepared. Shadowed photomicrographs of the blend shows the dominance of latex particles. This is a prior art example. EXAMPLE 3 A physical blend of particles of Rhoplex AC 388 and a talc Nytal 300 at a 1 to 4 ratio of polymer to pigment was prepared. Shadowed photomicrographs of the blend shows the dominance of pigment particles. This is a prior art example. EXAMPLE 4 Finely divided talc particles Nytal 300 were encapsulated with poly vinyl acetate at a 4 to 1 ratio of polymer to pigment. A nonionic surfactant and a nonionic initiator and nonionic catalyst redox system was used.Examination of SEM photomicrographs did not reveal the presence of any spherical latex particles. The shape of the talc particles is such that latex particles would have easily been seen. EXAMPLE 5 SEM photographs and EDAX traces of a production sample, conventional, commercial semi gloss 26 percent pigment volume concentration PVC were made. SEM is scanning electron microscope and EDAX is analysis of the fluorescence pattern in conjunction with the SEM. The 26 PVC saint was 15,57 kg 7,57 1 prepared as follows 34.6 pounds of propylene glycol and 2 1,35 kg 6,75 kq gallons of water were mixed. 3 pounds of L 475 Antifoam, 15 0,9 kg 1.8 ka pounds of Tamol 731, 2 pounds of Triton GR 7, 4 pounds of 108 ka 67,5 g Igepal C0 880, 240 pounds of R 900 TiO2, and 0.15 pounds ofPMA 30 were added sequentially.The admixture was 9round for 7,57 1 20 minutes at high speed. 2 gallons of water was used as a 153,5 1 1,35 ka 1.8 ka rinse. 40.5 gallons of water, i pounds of L 475 Antifoam 4 0,45 kg pounds of OP 4400H and 1 pound of 29 percent of ammonia solution were premixed by addition in a sequential order.The premix was dissolved and added to the main admixture with 730,68 kg 36,57 kq agitation. 290.4 pounds of Rhoplex AC 388 and 81.27 pounds of Ucar Latex 367 were added sequentially with agitation.The mixture was mixed for 30 minutes after all of the ingredients had been added excessive mixing time would cause foaming . A SEM photograph anda EDAX trace were made of a polymer encapsulated pigment, based on Titanox 2010 NLIndustries, Titanium Pigments Division, titanium dioxide which was encapsulated with an84 percent vinyl acetate l6 percent butyl acrylate polymer at TiO2 polymer resin ratio 26 percent PVC which was equivalent to the above 26 PVC paint. In both paints the particle size of the TiO2 0.2 cm is quite similar to the latex size rJ0.5 m so that the comparison is more difficult to make than in the above examples.Nonetheless, in the conventional paint. 26 PVC paint the latex pigment mixture can clearly be seen while in the paint containing the polymer encapsulated pigments only one type of encapsulated particle is apparent. EXAMPLE 6 TiO2 Titanox 2020 was dispersed with the typical small amount of dispersant Tamol 731 used in conventional paint technology, an aqueous dispersion resulting. This was a control. A laboratory prepared paint based on the following formulation 25 PVC was prepared.

This was a conventional paint.A polymer encapsulated pigment was prepared encapsulatingTitanox 2020 with poly vinyl acetate at an equivalentTiO2 polymer ratio 25 percent PVC . SEM microphotographs were made in all three instances. By comparing the photographs of the control TiO2 dispersion, conventional paint and the polymer encapsulated pigment, the difference between the polymer encapsulated pigments versus the TiO2 pigment control and the paint mixture was quite apparent.The polymer encapsulated pigments appear to consist of a uniform encapsulation with an absence of latex particles, which was not the case with the control and the paint mixture. EXAMPLE 7 TiO2 was encapsulated with a copolymer of vinyl acetate and butyl acrylate 84 percent 16 percent the ratio ofTiO2 to copolymer was 50 to SO. The polymer encapsulatedTiO was incorporated into 22 percent PVC paint so as to have 25P,58 kg m3 2.1 pounds of TiO2 per gallon. SEH microphotographs were made of a cross section of a film of the 22 PVC composition having the polymer encapsulated pigment and of a cross section of a film of the commercial 26 PVC paint of 287,52 kg m Example 5. The paint had 2.4 pounds of TiO2 per gallon.In the invention film cross section, the film itself appeared much less porous, and the TiO2 cores appeared to be much more uniformly distributed throughout the cross section than was apparent in the conventional paint film cross section. EXAMPLE 8 A number of other observations provided indirect evidence that a real difference exists between conventional paint and paints containing the polymer encapsulated i52 pin pigments. When side by side comparisons were made of 6 mil wet draw ddwns of a polymer encapsulated TiO2 versus a conventional semi gloss paint TiO2 latex polymer mixture and the films were allowed to dry, a visual appearance difference existed. Although measured gloss differences were not large at equivalent pigment polymer ratio same P C level when measured by the usual 60 gloss meter, the polymer encapsulated pigment films provided a clarity or sparkle similar to a distinctness of image dot character not seen in the conventional paint films. Most such comparisons were made on Leneta charts or Leneta scrub resistance panels. When cast on a metal surface aluminum panel , the polymer encapsulated pigment film appeared to telegraph the metal surface through to the semi gloss paint film. Comparative scrub resistance measurements of conventional semi gloss paints versus polymer encapsulated pigment films at equivalent PVC levels also showed advantages for the polymer encapsulated pigment film as long as a reasonable attempt was made to maintain a high molecular weight in the encapsulating polymer layer exercised using conventional latex technology principles. Apparent hiding improvements of polymer encapsulated pigment films versus conventional paints were also observed.The magnitude of these differences were approximately those seen in competitive plastic pigment technologies, e.g., those technologies reported by Glidden and Dulux, which permit equivalent hiding at about a 30 percent reduction in TiO2 level. Exceptional stability in TiO2 based polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions also existed.Attempts to centifuge 50 percent solids, 15 PVC polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions based on TiO2 RCL 9 encapsulated with 84 16 vinyl acetate butyl acrylate copolymer and to separate a supernatant layer failed. The stability was so high that no separation occurred under the conditions selected. Although control TiO2 dispersions were not run, operation was conducted under conditions at which an easy separation would be expected. Repeated observations were made during the preparation of polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions that indicate that an extremely high degree of dispersion was readily obtained. In fact, an optical light microscope was used to examine dilutions of reaction mixtures, and the absence of large flocculates was frequently observed.The wetting behavior on a drawdown of many of the polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions side by side with conventional paints appeared to cause a separation or demixing of the films. Addition of some anionic wetting agent or intentionally mixing a polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion with a conventional paint removed this apparent wetting incompatibility. All of these behavioral differences show that substantial and potentially significant differences exist between the polymer encapsulated pigment technology and conventional paint technology or prior art technologies related to plastic pigments. xABTst 9 Zopaque RLC 9 TiO2 Glidden Pigments Division yielded polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions of excellent stability a 15 PVC version was still stable after six months with no syneresis. The best success was obtained withTitanox 2010 NL Industries, Titanium Pigments Division which is considered to be a grade of TiO2 for plastics rather than coatings applications with a content of 97 percent TiO2 and a trace 1 percent of alumina A1203 surface treatment. Stable dispersions and good film quality resulted and were reproduced from batch to batch preparations of the polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion. Titanox 2020, a coatings grade Ti 02 , has also been used to prepare polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions. TiO2 of the brand Tronox CR 822 Kerr McGee gave stable dispersions but SEM photographs suggested that encapsulation was not uniform, and the polymer layer appeared to be lopsidedly attached to the TiO2 particles. Film quality also suffered. On the assumption that a surface treatment existed, extraction of the TiO2 with water monomer mixes, e.g., vinyl acetate, was attempted. Serious foaming with no improvement in encapsulation was observed. In addition to the well known alumina A1203 and silica SiO2 treatments which are widely applied to coatings grades of TiO2, both organic surface treatments and pH adjustments with ammonia, amines, or alkali hydroxides are frequently employed and sometimes are varied from lot to lot.Apparently adverse effects occur from organic and non uniform inorganic surface treatment of many grades of TiO2. Untreated high purity TiO2 are accordingly preferred. Polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions were made at a level of 70 percent total solids with a 90 10 pigment polymer ratio using Atomite CaCO3 pigment and vinyl acetate monomer. A smooth, thick but handleable dispersion resulted which showed substantial syneresis after one to two days.This dispersion was made with 2.5 part of T Det N 1007 on solids. Improved stabilization would occur in the 4 to 10 part range of solids. Untreated Omyacarb DF CaCO3 was used to prepare a 68 percent total solids polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion at a 90 10 pigment polymer ratio using polyvinyl acetate. After five days, no syneresis was observed. The viscosity was high but handleable, and the dispersion showed a low brushometer viscosity of 1.3 poise at high shear rate. The low shear rate viscosity or degree of thixotropy probably could be reduced by the addition of anionic surfactant. A clay ASP 170 plus vinyl acetate monomer was used to make a 62 percent total solids polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion at a 9 1 pigment to polymer ratio. After one month, the dispersion was stable and remained handleable with a trace of syneresis. A screening experiment with a red iron oxide yielded a fluid dispersion in which the red color was extremely bright. A successful screening test was made with a zinc oxide, a reactive pigment. Ti Pure R 900 duPont, TiO2 did not disperse readily in the initial reaction mixture. Once the initiation of the reaction began, the R 900 appeared to deflocculate and smooth, stable dispersion results. Film drawdowns gave variable appearance gloss after drying, and considerable variation batch to batch and from one lot of pigment to another was seen. Ti Pure R 960 duPont dispersed readily in the initial reaction mixture containing vinyl acetate monomer. The polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion did not have outstanding stability and showed syneresis water layer formation after about one month. Only one run was made withR 960. Ti Pure R 932 dispersed poorly under all conditions, and a high quality polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion was not made. R 931 is a flocculated TiO2 pigment grade, so poor dispersion was expected. A 70 percent total solids polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion was made with Beaverwhite 325 talc and vinyl acetate monomer at a pigment polymer ratio of 9 1. Substantial syneresis occurred in one to two days. An attempt was made to prepare a 56 percent total solids 44 wm polymer encapsuiated pigment dispersion of 325 mesh wet ground mica again, substantial syneresis occurred in one or two days. EXAMPLE 10 Hiding comparisons were also made on Leneta 38 opacity charts and visually compared. At equivalent content of TiO, 287,52 kg m3 2.4 libs. per gal. , the polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion clearly gave better hiding power than did the commercial paint fotniulation even when compared against toned production sample. Numerous visual comparisons versus conventional technology were made over a wide pigment polymer ratio with polymer encapsulated pigments based on Titanox 2010. While in conventional paint technology the maximum 359,4 395,34 kg m attainable hide is normally achieved at 3.0 to 3.3 lbs. gal.of TiO2 in semi gloss paints, extrapolation of the visual comparisons indicated that polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions could achieve equivalent hide somewhere in the 287,52 347,42 kg m range of 2.4 to 2.9 lbs. gal. as Titanox 2010. A uniform polymer layer such as that achieved with Titanox 2010 is required. Further, from an understanding of alternative technologies for increasing hiding power, e.g., the use of fine particle pigment extenders such as Omyacarb UF, or polystyrene plastic Figments as practiced by Glidden, or the styrene polyester encapsulated TiO2 Spindrift of Dulux, it is estimated that the improvement of hiding achievable with polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions is at least equivalent to the 30 percent reduction in TiO2 content claimed and apparently achieved by these alternative technologies. EXAMPLE 11 Comparisons of the scrub resistance of polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions paints versus commercial paint from Example 5 are shown in Table II. At equivalent binder content, the polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions showed about a 4 fold increase in side by side comparisons. On long term drying 2 weeks of the paints, the differential increased to about a 5 times advantage for the polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions. Care should be taken in the preparation of polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions to use those techniques which maximize molecular weight in typical latexes, e.g., low catalyst, low temperature, high monomer concentrations, so that scrub resistance is maximized.Comparative wet adhesion tests on glossy alkyd aged Glidden Shamrock Green were also run on the same samples, but no significant degree of wet adhesion was shown by either the PEP dispersion 22 PVC or the commercial production paint from Example 5.

EXAMPLE 12 On short term dry, the block resistance of polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions as semi gloss paints was inferior to conventional paint technology. The rate of water release appeared to be hindered by the polymer encapsulated pigment structure of a layer of polymer encapsulating a pigment particle. Yet, for a 9 PVC film of a polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion based on a 1 4 Zopaque RCL 9 TiO2 pigment 848 vinyl acetate 168 butyl acrylated polymer, after a 6 months drying, the block resistance of such a 6 mil wet film as excellent. In a brush lapping test, there was a 20 minute lap time, 8 hour tack time and 24 hour dry to touch time when equilibrated.In one experiment, TiO2 was encapsulated with a 60 butyl ac rylate cores408 styrene shell in stages at a 1 4 pigment to polymer ratio. Films of the polymer encapsulated pigment dispersion on air drying fell apart after a 500 gram weight pressed them tace to face overnight. The same slow water release was visually observed to provide improved open time to polymer encapsulated pigment dispersions compared to conventional semi gloss paints even without the incorporation of the traditional propylene glycol additive. This improvement is 4 to 5 times based on limited observations . EXAMPLE 13 This example demonstrates the polymeric microencapsulation of pigments using standard emulsion polymerization techniques.

The admixture was then cooled to room temperature and transferred. The polymer encapsulated pigments had a weight of solids of 52.1 percent, a Stormer viscosity of 100 KU, a Brookfield mPa. s viscosity 0.3 rpm of 5600 cps, and an ICI high shear 50 mPa.s viscosity of 0.5 poise.

EXAMPLE 14 Using the general procedure outlined in Example 13, the pigment system used in Union Carbide s published formulation 1 1212 was encapsulated once at a PVC of 45 and ounce at aPVC of 60 using a 78 22 vinyl acetate n butyl acrylate ratio. Portions of these two polymer encapsulated pigments were then blended to give 50 PVC and 55 PVC systems. As controls, paints were made by conventional means at 45 PVC and 60 PVC and portions thereof blended to provide 50 PVC and 55 PVC paints. The results of the evaluations of these systems are shown in Tables III and IV.

The initial reactor charge vas added t room temperature and admixed.The reactor was a 3 liter jacketed resin flask, with the steamiwater controlled by instrumentation for heating and cooling, and using an electric stirrer motor vith a stainless steel shaft, one blade and digetal readout of the rpms. An initial charge of 1.3 ga of t butyl hydroperoxide was added to the reactor at 35 C. Then a solution of 1.3 ga of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate and 8 gm of water was slowly added to the reactor at 35 C. The temperature was raised to 70 C and maintained there.The rest of the monomer mixture was fed in over a four hour period. A solution of 3.6 ga of t butyl hydroperoxide and 34 gn of water and a solution of 2.4 gm of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate and 34 gm of water were separately fed into the reactor over a 4 1 2 hour period. The monomer mixture and catalyst solutions were concurrently fed into the reactor starting at the same time. The agitation, once the 70 C level was reached, was about 200 rpm, was jurt below 300 rpm when the monomer and catalyst additions started, and rose to about 1000 rpm at the end of the addition. The reaction mixture was port heated for 30 minutes after the feeding in of the catalyst. The reaction mixture was cooled and removed from the reactor.The resultant latex had a total solids of 66.15 percent, a 0,325 Pa.s brushometer viscosity of 3.25 poise and a Brookfield mPa.s viscosity of 5,350 cps LVT Mode V, 60 rpm . EXAMPLE 16 This example demonstrates an emulsion polynerization technique and latex which can be used to encapsulate pigments.

The reactor was a 3 liter jacketed resin flask, with the steaw water controlled by instrumentation for heating and cooling, and using an electric stirrer motor with a stainless steel shaft, one blade and digital readout of the rpms. An initial charge of 1.04 go of t butyl hydroperoxide was added to the reactor at 35 C. Then the solution of 1.04 gm of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate and 6.4 gn of water was slowly added to the reactor at 35 C. The temperature was raised to 70C. and maintained there.The rest of the monomer mixture was fed in over a four hour period. A solution of 2.88 g. of t butyl hydroperoxide and 27.2 gm of water and a solution of 1.92 gm of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate and 27.2 gm of water were separately fed into the reactor over a 4 1 2 hour period.The monomer mixture and catalyst solutions were concurrantly fed into the reactor starting at the same time.

The reason was to study the effect of adding latex to the reaction mixture and the effect on viscosity. The reaction mixture was poet heated for 30 minutes after the feeding in of the catalyst. The reaction mixture was cooled and removed fror the reactor.The resultant latex had a total solids of 65.33 percent, 0,219 Pa.s brushometer viscosity of 2.19 poise and a Brookfield mPa.s viscosity of 8,300 cpa LVT Mode V, 60 rpm .

A reactor was purged with nitrogen. 485 gm of water were added to the reactor. 264 gm of pigments 26 gm of TiPure R 900 and 238 of Santintone um 5 were added to the reactor and the admixture was agitated at a moderate level about 200 rpm . ô7 gm of V Pyrol was added while the admixture was agitated at a high level 250 to 270 rpm for about S minutes. 51 gm of T DET N 507 was added while the admixture was RTI ID 53.45 agitated at 270 rpm for 5 minutes. Then 1 gi of Nalco 71 D5 anti foam was added. The initial reactor charge was added at room temperature and admixed.

An initial charge of 1.3 go of t butyl hydroperoxide 70 percent aqueous and 5.0 of distilled vater were added to the reactor at 35 C. and mixed for S minutes at 270 rpm.Then a reducer solution of 1.3 gm of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate and 8 gn of water was added to the reactor at 500C. When the reactor isotherm reached 60 to 65 C., monomer and catalyst reducing feeds were begun A monomer mixture of 550 gm of vinyl acetate, 155 gm of n butyl ac rylate and 7 gm ofNalco 71 D5 was linearly fed in over a four hour period. A catalyst solution of 3.63 gm of t butyl hydroperoxide TBHP and 34 gm of water and a reducing solution of 24 gm of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate SFS and 34 gm of water were linearly separately fed into the reactor over a 4 hour period.The monomer mixture and catalyst redueer solutions were concurrently fed into the reactor starting at the same time. The temperature was maintained at 60 to 6S C. during the reaction and the agitation level speed was increased as necessary to maintain a vortex or good mixing. The reaction mixture was post heated at 70 to 75 C. for 30 minutes using minimal agitation after the feeding in of the catalyst. 0.75 go of Dowicil 75 and 3.0 gn of distilled water were added to the reaction mixture.
