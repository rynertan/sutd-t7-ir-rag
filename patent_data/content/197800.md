## Description
5 THIAPROSTAGLANDINS E1 AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SAME BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel 5thiaprostaglandins E1 and a process for producing the same. More specifically, the present invention relates to novel 5 thiaprostaglandins E1 useful as medicines for the treatment and prevention of digestive organic diseases such as a duodenal ulcer or a gastric ulcer.The present invention also relates to a process for producing the 5 thiaprostaglandins E1 , in which 7 5 thia b prostaglandins E1 having a double bond between the 7 and 8 positions are selectively reduced or 7 hydroxy 5 thiaprostaglandins E1 having a hydroxyl group at the 7 position is dehydroxylated, followed by selectively reducing. 2. Description of the Related Art Natural prostaglandins are known as local hormones having a biologically and pharmacologically high activity and, therefore, a large number of studies on their derivatives have been made. Among natural prostaglandins, prostaglandin E1 has, for example, a strong blood platelet aggregation inhibition effect and vasodilation effect and, therefore, is used for clinical applications. The greatest defect of natural prostaglandins, especially prostaglandins E1 i.e., PGE1 , is that they can not be orally administered, because they are rapidly metabolized when orally administered and, therefore, must be usually administered by an intravenous or intraarterial injection. Various studies have been made of the conventional manner of preparing synthetic prostaglandins by replacing one or two carbon atoms forming the skeleton of natural prostaglandins with a sulfur atom s . For example, there are known 1Sthiaprostaglandin E2 or F2a wherein the carbon atom at the 1 position of natural prostaglandins is replaced with a sulfur atom i.e., since the sulfur atom is present at the l position, lS is nominated the head of the name of the compound and similarly the number of the position at which sulfur is substituted and the suffix S are used at the head of the compound J.

Thus, the desired 5 thiaprostaglandins E1 having the general formula I can be prepared. The 7 hydroxy 5 thiaprostaglandins E1 of the formula III can be readily obtained, for example, by a one stage reaction from the protected 4 hydroxy 2cyclopentenone, at a high yield as follows.

Of these soluents, the use of halogenated hydrocarbons is especially preferable. The reactive derivatives of the organosulfonic acids preferably include organosulfonic acid halides and organosulfonic acid anhydrides. Typical examples of the organosulfonic halides are methanesulfonic chloride, ethanesulfonic bromide, n butanesulfonic chloride, t buctanesulfonic chloride, trifluoromethanesulfonic chloride, nonafluorobutanesulfonic chloride, t butanesulfonic chloride, trifluoromethanesulfonic chloride, nonafluorobutanesulfonic chloride, benzenesulfonic chloride, p toluenesulfonic chloride, 4 bromobenzenesulfonic chloride, pentafluorobenzenesulfonic chloride, 4 chloro 3 nitrobenzenesulfonic chloride, 2,3,4 trichlorobenzenesulfonic chloride, and 2 phenylethanesulfonic chloride.

Of these acid anhydrides, the use of methanesulfonic anhydride, trifluromethanesulfonic anhydride, and p toluenesulfonic anhydride is preferable. The above mentioned reaction of the hydroxyl group at the 7 position of the 7 hydroxy 5 thiaprostaglandinsE1 and the reactive derivatives of organosulfonic acids stoichiometrically occurs in an equimolar reaction.Practically, 1 to 50 times, preferably 1 to 10 times by mol, based on one mole of the 7 hydroxy 5 thiaprostaglandins El , of the reactive derivatives of the organosulfonic acids are used. The reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of 200C to 100 C, preferably OOC to 500C for 1 to 60 hours, preferably 2 to 12 hours. Thus, in the first reaction, the corresponding 7 organosulfonyloxy 5 thiaprostaglandins E1 i.e., the compound in which the hydroxyl group at the 7 position of the 7 hydroxy 5 thiaprostaglandins III is substituted with an organosulfonyloxy group is formed. The 7 organosulfonyloxy 5 thiaprostaglandins E1 thus formed are treated with basic compounds i.e., the second reaction .As a result, the 7 oranosulfonyloxy5 thiaprostaglandins E1 release the organosulfonic group to form a double bond between the carbon atoms of the 7 and 8 positions. Thus, the 5 thia A 7 prostag landins E1 of the formula II are obtained. The second reaction can be carried out by using similar basic compounds at a temperature similar to that of the above mentioned first reaction. The first and second reactions may be carried out either by isolating the 7 organosulfonyloxy 5thiaprostaglandins E1 formed in the first reaction or by using the same reaction system without separating the resultant 7 organosulfonyloxy 5 thiaprostaglandins El from the reaction mixture. In the latter case, the second reaction may be carried out with or without adding the fresh basic compounds after the first reaction. The basic compounds used in the first and second reactions may be the same or different. For example, the first reaction is carried out by using a relatively weak base such as pyridine, triethyl amine, or isopropyldimethyl amine and the second reaction is carried out by using a relatively strong base such as 4 dimethylamino pyridine and 1,5 diazabicyclo 4, 3, o nona 3 ene.

The desired compounds obtained above can be subjected to the deprotection reaction and or salt formation reaction, and or salt formation reaction. The removal of the protective group R21 and R31 of a hydroxyl group i.e., the deprotection reaction , when the protective group is a group forming an acetal linkage together with an oxygen atom of a hydroxyl group, is conveniently carried out in a reaction solvent such as water, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl ether, dioxane, acetone, and acetonitrile, in the presence of a catalyst such as acetic acid, the pyridinium p toluensulfonate or a cation exchange resin. The deprotection reaction is usually carried out at a temperature ranging from 780C to 300C for approximately 10 minutes to 3 days. In the case where the protective group is a tri C1 C7 hydrocarbon silyl group, the reaction is carried out by using, for example, acetic acid, tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride, or cesium fluoride, preferably tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride, or cesium fluoride, preferably in the presence of a basic compound such as triethylamine.

The reaction temperature and the reaction time are similar to those of the above mentioned deprotection reaction in the case of the acetal linkage. The hydrolysis of the 5 thia 7 prostaglandin E1 i.e., the hydrolysis of the ester group in the case ofR11 a C1 C10 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C3 Cl0 cycloalkyl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl Cl C2 alkyl group can be carried out, for example, by treating the compound in water or an aqueous solvent with an enzyme such as lipase at a temperature of 100C to 600C for approximately 10 minutes to 24 hours. The salt forming reaction of the 5 thia ss7 prostaglandins E1 i.e., the salt forming reaction of the carboxyl group in the case of Rll in the l position being a hydrogen atom is known per se, and is carried out by a neutralization reaction with an inorganic basic compound, such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and sodium carbonate, or an organic basic compound, such as ammonia, trimethylamine, monoethanolamine, and morpholine, in an amount substantially equal to that of the 5 thia 7 prostaglandin E1 according to a conventional method. The desired 5 thia d7 prostaglandins E1 obtained above are then selectively reduced. The selective reduction is carried out, preferably, by a reduction method using zinc type reducing agents such as zincsilver reducing agents and zinc copper reducing agents, or a reduction method using an organotin hydrogenide compound. When the zinc reducing agent is used, the reaction is carried out also in the presence of glacial acetic acid.Although there are no specific limitations to the amount of the zinc reducing agents used, the reducing agent is generally used in an amount of 1 to 1000 moles, preferably 5 to 200 moles, based on 1 mole of the starting compound II in the presence of 1 to 2000 moles, preferably 10 to 1000 moles, also based on 1 mole of the starting compound II .

The reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of 0 C to 1150C, preferably 100C to 800C, for 1 to 48 hours, preferably 3 to 24 hours, although these conditions may vary depending upon, for example, the kinds of the starting compounds, reagents, and solvents and also the reaction conditions.The progress of the reaction is followed or monitored by, for example, a thin layer chromatography. After the completion of the reaction, the desired 5thiaprostaglandins E1 having the general formula I can be recovered and purified by treating the reaction mixture in a conventional manner. For example, the reaction mixture is treated by extraction, washing, drying, condensing, or chromatography, or any combination thereof.

The reaction solvents such as alcohols may be used, but, generally speaking, the use of no solvent reaction is preferable. The reaction can be smoothly progressed by using a free radical type initiator or photo irradiation. Typical examples of such initiators are a,a azobisisobutyronitrile and di t butyl peroxide. These initiators are generally used in an amount of 0.01 to 10 equivalent, preferably 0.1 to 1 equivalent, based on the starting material II . The reaction temperature is generally OOC to 2000C, preferably 300C to 1300C. The progress of the reaction can be followed or monitored by, for example, a thin layer chromatography method. When the reaction is ionically proceeded, a palladium catalyst such as tetrakis triphenylphospine palladium is used in an amount of, generally 0.001 to 0.1 equivalent, preferably 0.005 to 0.02 equivalent. The reaction is carried out generally at a temperature of OOC to 2000C, preferably 10 C to 500C. After the reaction, the desired 5 thiaprostaglandins E1 having the general formula I are recovered and purified by treating the reaction mixture in any conventional manner, for example, by filtration, concentration, chromatography, or the like, or any combination thereof. The desired compounds thus obtained may be subjected to the above mentioned deprotection and or hydrolysis and or salt formation reaction, if necessary. Thus, the desired 5 thiaprostagla..dins E1 of the formula I can be obtained at a high yield under moderate reaction conditions according to the present invention. Of the 5 thiaprostaglandins E1 according to the present invention, 16 hydroxy 16 methyl 5thiaprostaglandin E1 methyl ester exhibits a strong anti ulcer activity and prevents the ulcer generation at a preventive rate of about 50 for an oral administration of 40 g kg in the case of rat indomethacin ulcer.Furthermore, in the case of rat ethanol ulcer, the ulcer generation can be prevented at a prevention rate of about 508 for an oral administration of 4 vg kg.
