# Polyethylene composition.

## Abstract
A polyethylene composition comprising three specific types of polyethylenes polyethylene A , polyethylene B and polyethylene C respectively. The polyethylene composi tion has a melt index not less than 0.001 g 10 min. and not more than 10 g cm and exhibits excellent processability under variant molding techniques. Molded objects exhibit excellent physical properties such as impact strength environmental stress cracking resistance and uniform thick ness distribution. Polyethylene A has a molecular weight of from 5,000 to 90,000 and polyethylene C has a molecular weight of from 100,000 to 1,500,000 and the ratio of the molecular weight of polyethylene C the molecular weight of polyethylene A is from 4 to 200. Polyethylene B has a molecular weight of from 50,000 to 500,000, being prepared by a polymerization with use of a chromium compound supported type catalyst capable of producing a specifically conditioned homopolyethylene with respect to the properties of the polymers in terms of flow ratio and die swell.
