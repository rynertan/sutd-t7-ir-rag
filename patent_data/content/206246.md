# ABSOLUTE POSITION MOUSE

## Abstract
Apparatus for determining the absolute position of a point on a surface including a tablet or overlay and a moveable mouse type cursor. The tablet includes a unique pattern of lines or regions along rectilinear or other axes. A series of ad jacent spaces formed by the lines define unique cells on the tablet. The mouse includes a pair of linear imaging arrays adapted to detect the presence of tablet lines adjacent thereto. An integrated processor identifies the line types, com putes line spacings and ratios, and identifies subtending cells by comparison to the known tablet topography. The processor further computes the precise location of a point defined on the mouse.
