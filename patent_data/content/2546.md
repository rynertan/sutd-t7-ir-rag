## Description
Improved photosensitive recording material and a method of recording information by exposure of said material to information wise modulated activating electro magnetic radiation. The present invention relates to improved photosensitive recording material and a method of recording information by exposure of said material to informationwise modulated activating electro magnetic radiation. In the published German Patent Application Dt OS 2,436,132 a process for producing a record of retrievable information has been described in which a recording layer containing as imaging substance an organo tellurium compound is used. In this process the organo tellurium compound, which contains halogen, preferably chlorine, linked directly to a tellurium atom and which contains at least one organic substituent comprising a carbonyl group, is reduced image wise by means of a photo exposed photo reductant e.g. a polyluclear quinone. The formation of the tellurium image proceeds by thermal development e.g. by overall heating the photoexposed material in the range of 80 to 2000 C. The following reaction scheme illustrates said process in which a tellurium metal image is formedEMI1.1 EMI2.1 whereinPQ is a photoreductant e.g. phenanthrenequinone, PQ is the first excited singlet of said quinone, 3PQ is the triplet state of said quinone,RH is a hydrogen donor e.g. an organic hydroxy compound,PQ.H2 is the photoreductant in reduce state, and CR 2.Te.Cl2 is a reducible organo tellurium compound wherein RÃš is e.g. C6E5COCH2 . A cisadvantage associated with recording materials containing these compounds is their rather lo photosensitivity. It has been established experimentally that the exposure energy required for a certain maximum optical density can be lowered considerably by using a recording material containing on the recording layer a blocking layer or sheet that counteracts the penetration of vapour or gas into and the escape of vapours or gases from the recording layer during the thermal development. In accordance with the present invention a recording material is provided which contains on a support a recording layer containing in admixture in a binder medium 1 as imaging substance an organo tellurium compound containing directly linked to the tellurium atom halc gen and at least one organic substituent comprising at least one carbonyl group, 2 a photoreductant, 3 a hydrogen donating compound from which hydrogen can be abstracted by the photo exposed photoreductant, and is characterized in that a blocking layer or sheet is per manently united with said recording layer, directly or through the intermediary of one or more subbing layers, to counteract the penetration of vapour or gas into and the escape of vapour or gas from the recording layer during thermal treatment after photoexposure of the material, the support and or said blocking layer or sheet in order to allow the exposure with actinic radiation of the recording layer being transparent for said radiation. By actinic radiation is understood here electromagnetic radiation e.g. ultraviolet radiation and or visible light to which the recording laye is sensitive for the image formation. The wording blocking layer includes here a single layer as well as n plurality of said layers. The gas or vapour impermeability of said layer or sheet is preferably such that when the recording layer of the control material A O described in the presentExample 1 is coated with said layer or sheet the described image wise exposure and thermal processing of the coated material yields tellurium images of which the image in the coated material has a maximum optical density D at least 0.2 higher than the corresponding maximum optical density of a tellurium image formed under identical exposure and processing conditions in an identical material but not coated with said layer or sheet. A blocking layer or sheet may be produced from polymeric materials, which include natural, modified natural, and synthetic resins. Examples are cellulose esters such as cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polystyrene, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride, silicone resins, poly acrylic ester and poly methacrylic ester resins and fluorinated hydrocarbon resins, and mixtures of the foregoing materials.Specific examples of various useful synthetic polymeric materials prepared by addition polymerization include pol isobutyl methacrylate , poly n butyl methacrylate , poly isobutyl methacrylate , copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and trifluorochloroethylene, a polyvinyl n butyral, a copoly vinyl acetate vinyl chloride ,a copoly acrylonitrile butadiene styrene , a copoly vinyl chloride vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol and poly N methoxy methyl acrylamide . Apart from the polymers produced by addition polymerization of unsaturated monomers, likewise polymers prepared by polyaddition, e.g. polyurethanes or polycondensation, e.g. polyamides and pclyester resins, may be used for preparing a useful blocking layer or sheet for the recording material of the present invention. According to a specific embodiment a blocking layer of the recording material according to the present invention is made of a cross linked polymer mass obtained by an acid catalyzed reaction of a polymer or mlxture of polymers containing reactive hydrogen atoms e.g. forming part of one or more groups of the class consisting of free hydroxyl groups, NHCO O groups, and COOH groups, and an organic compound containing a plurality of etherified N methylol groups, preferably N CH20CH3 groups as cross linking agent. A polymer containing reactive hydrogen atoms forming part of free hydroxyl groups and appropriate for acidcatalyzed cross linking with compounds containing etherified N methylol groups is, e.g., a polyester comprising free hydroxyl groups, a polyvinyl acetal in which part of the hydroxyl groups of the polyvinyl alcohol starting product has not been acetalized, a copolymer of vinyl alcohol and vinyl chloride, or a copolymer of vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate and vinyl alcohol. A preferably used polymer containing free hydroxyl groups is a polyvinyl butyral with frort 80 to 90 by weight of vinyl butyral units, 7 to 20 by weight of vinyl alcohol units and 0 to 3 by weight of vinyl ester units, e.g. vinyl acetate units. The molecular weight of the polyvinyl butyral ma be within a roal range but is preferably between 45,000 and 55,000. Polyvinyl butyrals characterized by an intrinsie viscosity of 0,75 to 1.25 dl.g 1 determind in ethanol at 20 C are particularly useful. Polymers containing reactive hydrogen atoms forming part of NH CO O groups and appropiate for acid catslyzed cross linking with compounds containing etherifiedN methylol groups are polyurethane polymers e.g. as described in United States Patent Specification 3,743,833. in example of a useful polyurethane polymer that is commercially available is sold unter the trade nameESTANE 5707 F 1 ESTANE is a trademark of the B.F. GoodrichChemical Company, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, for a polyurethane resin . Appropiate crosslinking agents containing a plurality of etherfied N methylol groups are derived from reaction products of formaldehyde with urea or with melamine. A particulary useful crosslinking for use in combination with said polyvinyl butyral is hexakis methoxymethyl melamine corresponding to the following structural formula EMI5.1 Such compound is commercially available under the trade name CYMEL 300 of American Cyanamid Company, NewYork, USA. It Is assumed that the acid catalyzed cross linking reaction of said compound with a polymer having reactive hydrogen atoms takes place as follows EMI6.1 wherein R represents the organic group of the polymer involved. The reaction proceeds preferably at elevated temperature. A preferred cross linking temperature also called curing temperature is the range of 80 to 160 C. The amount of cross linking agent with respect to said cross linkable polymers is preferably in the range of 5 to 20 by weight. In practice it is preferred to use es catalyst strong acds such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, monobutyl phosphate, polystyrene sulphonic acid and p toluene sulphonic acid. Preferably p toluene sulphonic acid is used, which is an acid that is soluble in an organic solvent such as ethanol is which the cross linkable polymer e.g. the polyvinyl butyral can be dissolved. The amount of acid catalyst with respect to cross linkable polymer is preferably in the range of 0.2 to 4 by weight.Since, as is apparent from the reactIon scheme hereinbefore hydrochloric acid is formed during thermal development it is possible to effect cross linking In situ during thermal development. The thickness in dry state of the blocking means in the form of a coating on the recording layer is preferably at least 5 m e.g. in the range of 5 to 200 m. The blocking coating will generally be an outermost coating. However, recording materials wherein such coating is itself overcoated are not excluded from the scope of the invention. The blocking coating may be aFplied from a polymer solution or dispersion, e.g. a latex which after drying and evaporation of the solvent or liquid dispersing medium leaves a continuous polymer layer. Care should be taken to apply the polymer solution or dispersion from a liquid medium that does not d.s. ve does not give rise to swelling of the tinder of the recording layer. A suitable blocking coating may l kewise be applied in the form of a sheet by lamination. An adhesive layer is normally used to more firmaly bind such coating to the recording layer.Adhesive and compositions for producing protective laminates are described, e.g. in the United States PatentSpecification 3,164,719 of Herbert Bauer, issued January 5, 1965. According to a simple embodiment a commercially available pressure sensitive adhesive sheet is used to obtain the desired blocking of the recording layer.Blocking sheets applied by means of an adhesive and that are useful for the purpose of the present invent Ion may have G thickness In the range of 50 to 20W m. According to still another embodiment a layer of polymerisable monomers is applied and allowed to polymerize in situ on the recording layer. A monomer suited tor formimg a blocking layer in that way is acrylamide. Reducible organo tellurium compounds 1 that are particularly suitable for use in a recording material of the present invention correspond to the following general formula RxTeCly wherein R represents an organic group, which is linked by a carbon atom to the tellurium atom ard contains at least one carbonyl group, x is 1, 2 or 3, and x y 4. Such compounds as well as their preparation are described in the published German Patent Application DT OS 2,436,132. A preferred class of maging agents are organetellurium compounds corresponding to the following general formula Ar OO CH2 2IeCl2 wherein Ar stands for an aromarie group includes a substitued aromatic group e.g. phenyl. methoxyphenyl, tolyl or naphthyl.Bis phenacyl tellurium dichloride is a preferred imaging agent for use according to the present invention in combination with a phorcre ctant, a hydrogen donor an optionally at least the acid sensitive reducing agent precursor. Any compound that obtelns reducing power with respect to said tellurium compound through photo induced hydregen abstraction from a hydrogen donating compound 3 can be used as photoreductant 2 . A survey of photoreductans is given in ResearchDisclosure October 1974, p. 14 17, No. 12617. Photoreductants 2 preferred for use according to the present invention are aromatic diketones and especially 1,2 and 1,4 benzoquinones with at least one fused on carbocyclic aromatic ring.

The hydrogen donating compound 3 is any conventional source of labile hydrogen as described e.g. in the UnitedStates Patent Specification 3,881,950. Herein especially hydrogen donating compounds are described, which have a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom to which is also bonded the oxygen atom of a hydroxy group and or the trivalent nitrogen atom of an amine substituent. Preferred hydrogen donating compounds 3 , from which hydrogen can be abstracted by said photo exposed photo reluctant correspond to the following general formulaEMI9.2 wherein each of R10 and R11, which may be the same or different, represents hydrogen, a hydrocarbon group including a straight chain, branched chain, and cyclic hydrocarbon group, which groups may be substituted, e.g. an alkyl group, a hydroxyalkyl group, a cycloalkyl group on an aryl , or an alkoxycarbonyl group e.g. a C2H5 O CO group,Z represents a single bond, an ethynylene groupEMI10.1 or the groupEMI10.2 wherein n represente a whole number e.g. 1 and 2, and each of R12 and R13, which may be the same or different, represents hydrogen, or an alkyl group e.g. methyl or together form part of a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring e.g. phenylene ring.

In addition to the above reagents 1 to 3 an organic reducing agent precursor may be used, which according to the German Patent Application No. P 2802666 increases the re en of the record ing material. From said organic reducing agent precursor by the action of an acid, e.g. HCl formed in the imaging reaction, a reductor is set free image wise, whereby image wise reduction of the organo tellurium compound takes place.When an acid sensitive organic reducing agent precursor is used it is not recommended to use simultaneously a covering layer that contains nondifferentially an acid for effecting overall curing or crosslinking cf that layer since some of that acid could reach the recording layer and set free the reducto, all over the recording layer and reduce the tellurium compound in a non differential way giving rise to background fo. A class of organic reducing agent precursors, from which by the action of an acid a reducing agent for saia organo tellurium compound can be set free includes paraand ortho dihydroxy aryl compounds of which at least one of the hydroxyl groups has been esterified and of which the remaining hydroxyl group if any may have been etherified. By acid catalyzed hydrolysis the hydroxyl group can be obtained in free state again so that the compound involved regains its reducing properties. Another class of acid sensitive organic reducing agent precursors is derived from pyrazolidin 3 one reductors, in which the active hydrogen atom in 2 position is temporarily blocked e.g. by reaction with an isocyanate or an acid halide.

A dry photographic coating containing the abovementioned ingredients can be formed by dissolving the binding agent or mixture of binding agents in a suitable inert solvent, which acts as dispersing or dissolving medium for the other ingredients and which is removed from the coating composition by evaporation so that a solid photographic recording layer on a properly chosen support is left. The supports may be of any kind encountered in silver halide photographic materials, e.g. paper and resin film. The photoreductant is used in the recording material in an amount which is preferably at least equimolar with respect to the organo tellurium compound. The coverage of the organo tellurium compound is preferably in the range of 1 to 10 g per sq.m.
