# Logic circuits.

## Abstract
A logic circuit, comprising a plurality of driver MOSFETS Q11, Q14 and one load MOSFET Q15, produces an output signal responsive to input signals. The driver MOSFETs Q11, ..., Q14 are each controlled by an input signal and the load MOSFET Q15 is controlled by one of the input signals to conduct at opposite times to the driver MOSFET controlled by the same input signal. Therefore, a logic circuit with low power consumption and a small area is provided.
