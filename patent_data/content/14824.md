# Process for making a composite semiconductor body and semiconductor body so produced.

## Abstract
Compound semiconductor bodies 13, 14 are formed by bonding layers 12 of polycrystalline supporting material to the two opposite faces of a monocrystalline semiconductor wafer 11 and then cutting the semiconductor wafer into two bodies in a plane parallel to said faces. The cut surface of each semiconductor body 13, 14 is then polished.
