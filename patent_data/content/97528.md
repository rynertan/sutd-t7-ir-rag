## Description
DYE PATTERN BSORPTION INTO PLASTICS This invention relates to dye absorption intoplastics, particularly dye absorption on, into and below plastic surfaces. Dye decorating and printing on plastic surfaces has frequently been attempted with varying degrees of success.Surface printing of plastic articles, eg. commercial signs, is done commercially with the drawback that surface printing and decoration is subject to wear and or chipping and fading after several weeks exposure to the weather including the sun.Attempts have been made to dye decorate and print plastics below the surface thereof with suL3iable dyes see for exampleUSP 3,860,388 to Haigh 1975 and USP 4,059,471 also to Ijaigh 1977 , which patents relate to dye absorption into thermoplastics and thermo set plastics. In a previous prior art process for textile or fabric decorating, sublimation dyes are printed on paper, e.g., in patterns, known as heat transfer paper. The heat transfer paper is placed e.g. against drapes or wall paper and heat applied, which causes the dyes to sublime from the heat transfer paper to form clear dye patterns in the drapes or wallpaper or other fabric . However, if such process is attempted with plastic sheet as the dye receptor surface, upon application of heat and pressure, the heat transfer paper adheres to the heat softened plastic, since the heat required to sublime the dyes is often sufficient to soften the plastic surface, to the detriment of tlc end product. The above prior art patents, however, disclose a solution to the above problem by interposing a polyolcfin separator sheet between the heat transfer paper and the dye receptor plastic surface. Heat and pressure are applied as more fully discussed below, which causes the dyes from the heat transfer paper to sublime through the separator sheet and on and into the receptor plastic sheet in a clear pattern. Tixe sheets are then cooled and the transfer paper and separator sheet removed from the receptor plastic sheet and a dye decorated plastic sheet is obtained. However, while the above prior art process is successful in transferrdng clear dye patterns on and below plastic surfaces it requires the preparation of the at iove heat transfer papers and the positioning of suitable intermediate separator sheets between the heat transfer paper and the plastic receptor surface which accordingly adds steps, delay and expense to obtaining the dye decorated and or printed plastic end product. Accordingly there is a need and market for an advance in the dye absorption decorating and printing of plastic products which omits certain of the above process steps, which speeds up the dye absorption process, reduces the cost thereof and even obtains greater clarity and definition of dye decorated products. There has now been discovered a method for dye absorption decoration of plastic articles wherein a separator sheet is omitted and patterns of dispersed dyes are transferred on and below the surface of a plastic article in clear vivid patterns.Moreover the dyes penetrate below the above plastic surface in greater concentrations than previously possible with an intervening separator sheet, to produce a dye decorated plastic, with wearproof design of improved clarity, definition and intensity. Broadly the present invention provides a method for transferring a dye pattern on and below the surface of a plastic article comprising applying one or more dispersed dyes in a desired pattern to the surface of the plastic article and applying sufficient subliming energy to such article and the dyes to sublime a substantial portion of the dyes on and below the surface of the plastic article. ln one emhodiment of the method of the invention, heat energy is applied to the plastic article to heat such article to sublime the dyes into the plastic as aforesaid. In another method embodying the invention, radio frequency energy is applied to the plastic article to heat such article sufficiently to sublime the dyes on and below the surface of the plastic article as aforesaid. In other methods of the invention, the printed dye receptor is laminated or fused to a substrate or issuing extrudate during the dye sublimation process. In another method of the invent ion, the printed dye receptor is molded during or after the dye sublimation process. The invention further provides decorated plastic articles, including molded articles and webs, having a surface penetrated with dispersed dyes in a pattern. By subliming energy , as used herein is meant, sufficient energy applied to the dye receptor disclosed herein, to cause such dyes to vaporize or sublime and to cause the dye receptor to become susceptible to penetration by the sublimed dyes. The invention will become more apparent from the following detailed specification and drawing in which Figures 1 and 2 are partial elevation views of apparatus employed in a dye transfer process of the prior art Figure 3 is a partial elevation view of a dye printing apparatus employed in the method embodying the present invent ion Figure 4 is a partial elevation view of a dye transfer apparatus employed in the dye transfer method embodying the present invention Figure 5 is a partial elevation view ol ans r d1 J ciratus employed in the dye transfer method relative to the apparatus of Figure 4 Figure 6 is a partial elevation view of another apparatus employed in another embodiment of the dye transfer method of the present invention Figure 7 is a fraqmentary elevation view of.another dye transfer method embodying the invention Figure 8 is a fragmentary elevation view of a dye penetrated article of the present invention Figure 9 is a plan view of a dye pattern absorbed plastic article Figures 10 and 11 are schematic elevation views of other dye transfer apparatus employed In the dye transfer methods embodying the present invention Figure 12 is a schematic elevation view of another embodiment of the dye transfer method of the present invention Figure 13 is a schematic elevation view of another embodiment of the dye transfer method of the present invention Figure 14 is a schematic partial elevation view of still another embodiment of the dye transfer method of the invention Figures 15 and 16 are partial sectional elevation views of another method embodying the dye transfer method of the invention and Figure 17 is an elevation view of a plastic product made by the dye transfer method of the present invention. Referring in more detail to the drawings, the above prior art patents disclose a method for transferring patterns of dispersed dyes to a plastic dye receptor by interposing a separator sheet between a heat transfer paper and the dye receptor plastic web, as shown or indicated in Figures 1 and 2.Accordingly polyethelene separator sheet 12 is placed between heat transfer paper 10 and dye receptor plastic web 14, between the plates 16 and 18 of the press 20, as shown in Fiqure 1.The press is closed to press the above sheets together. e.g. at 10 psig and temperatures of over 230 F are applied, which causes the dyes to sublime. from the heat transfer paper 10 through the separator sheet 12 and on and into the receptor plastic web 14 in a clearly defined pattern. The sheets are then cooled in place or transferred to a coolinq station eg.station 22, shown in Figure 2 the transfer paper 10 and the separator sheet 12 are removed from the receptor plastic web 14 and a decorated plastic with a pattern which penetrates helow the surface thereof is obtained. As noted above, the present invention is an improvement on the above process in that certain of the above steps are omitted and such process is speeded up. Accordingly, the heat transfer paper is omitted and the printing plate 24, carrying a desired pattern 25 thereon, eg. a photo image or a raised or grooved image, is coated with selected dispersable dyes eg. by brush, pad, roller or other means known in the art and the coated pattern 25 is lowered into direct Contact with the surface of a plastic article e.g. plastic receptor sheet 26, on support member 28, as shown in Figure 3 to print the resulting dye pattern on the surface thereof. The plate 24 is then raised above the printed sheet 26.At this point if desired, additional dyes can be added to the same or a different pattern on the plate 24 and the plate can be indexed to print in the same or a different location on the sheet 26, and the plate 24 is again lowered to further print a dye pattern on the surface of the receptor sheet 26. The so printed plastic sheet 26 is then advantageously placed between a pair of inert release sheets 34 and 36, which sheets are then placed between the plates 30 and 32 of the heating press 33, as shown in Figure 4. The release sheets 34 and 36 are of inert material eq., polytetrafluoroethylene known as teflon, which release sheets serve to confine the vaporized or sublimed dyes and direct them into the receptor sheet 26 for virtually complete dye transfer and absorption into the receptor sheet 26. The release sheets further assist the removal of the dye absorbed receptor sheet 26 from the press 33 after such dye transfer step.The press 33 is closed e.q. by lowerinq the plate 32 into contact with the upper release sheet 34 of the three sheet asemly 29, which assembly 29 rests on support plate 30, to apply a pressure, of e.g. 30 psig and heat, e.g. at 400 F for about thirty seconds, which causes the dyes to quickly sublime on and into the plastic receptor sheet 26 in a clearly defined pattern. The so deeorated sheet 26 is then either cooled in place or transferred with said release sheets, to a cooling station e.g. cooling press 38, having cooled plates 37 and 39 as shown in Figure 5, which plates desirably close on the three sheet assembly during the cooling step.The plastic is cooled below its softening temperature, e.g. 200 F, the press 38 is opened, the release sheets removed and a decorated plastic product with clearly defined, wear proof desiqn is obtained, e.g. product 42 having design 44, as shown in figure 9. The steps shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5 can take place in about thirty seconds each. In another embodiment of the method of dye absorption into plastics of the invention, the plastic receptor sheet 26, printed on its surface with dyes as shown and discussed above relative to Figure 3, is placed in a dielectric heater or RF press 40, which emits radio frequency waves which heat a dielectric, ie. the dye receptor sheet 26, to a dye sublimation temperature, as indicated in Figure 6. Accordinqly, the receptor sheet 26 is placed between a brass plate 51, above, and a Bakelite pad 53 below, which plate 51 and pad 53 are slightly larger in area than the receptor sheet 26 and the three layers are placed in the RF press 40 between the two electrodes or plates 55 and 57 of such press 40, as shown inFigure 6.The lower plate 57 advantageously has a resilient pad 59 mounted thereon, as shown in Figure 6. lthe plates are connected by conductors 61 and 63 to a power source of eo 2 90 megahertz mHz produced by a high frequency oscillator not shown . The brass plate 51 serves to uniformly flistril.ute theRF waves through the receptor sheet 26 and tiae leakelite pad 53 prevents the PF waves from penetratfng and damaginq the lower p ate 57. The Bakelite pad is an inert p astic pad of eg polyethylene, ABS or other inert p astic barrier. Radio frequency signals of about 2 to g0 mltz at about .1 to .5 kw sq. in. across the area of the sheet are generated for 1 to 12 seeonds, which heats up the surface of the plastic receptor sheet 26 to sufficiently heat the dyes to sublime on and below the surface of said receptor again in a clearly defined pattern, as indicated in Figure 6. The so decorated receptor sheet 26 is then either cooled in place or transferred e.g., with a cover sheet eq of teflon not shown and theBakelite pad 53, to a cooling station, eg., station 38, shown in Figure 5. The plastic sheet 26 is cooled, as discussed above, to obtain the dye absorbed plastic product, e.g., product 42 having design 44, shown in Figure 9. If desired a pair of teflon release sheets not shown can be placed above and below the receptor sheet 26, i.e., between said sheet 26 and the brass plate 51 above, and between said sheet 26 and the Bakelite pad 53 below. However, it has been found that the brass plate 51 and the Bakelite pad 53, in flanking the dye receptor sheet 26 serve also to confine the sublimed dyes therebetween in said sheet 26. Further the nature of the RF energy applied to the molecules of the receptor sheet 26, attracts the sublimed dyes into said sheet, markedly reducing the tendency of such sublimed dyes to escape. It is frequently desired to obtain a dye decorated end product of greater thickness, depending upon the structural requirements of the end product. Accordingly it is advantageous to position a dye printed receptor web atop a substrate web so as to use one heat and pres. .tirc step to sublime the dye pattern into the upper web while fusing or laminating the upper web to the substrate or lower web in one step. Accordingly, the dye printed plastic r eeptor sleet 26, positioned atop substrate or sublayPr plastic sheet 27, are both placed between release sheets 29 and 31 and such sheet assembly is placed, in turn, between the plates 41 and 43 of dye transfer station 39j as shown in Figure 7.The sheet assembly can accordingly be inserted between the plates 30 and 32 of thermo press 33, shown in Figure 4 or between the plates of radio frequency r.tation 40, shown in Figure 6, the assembly being heated to sublime the dyes into the upper sheet 26 while laminating said sheet 26 to the substrate 27. The so bonded product with its release sheets 29 and 31, can be either cooled in place or e.g. between the plates of the cooling station 38 of Figure 5 and the release sheets separated therefrom, to obtain the fused or laminated plastic, dyeabsorbed product 45, shown in Figure 8. In other methods embodying the present invention, at least some of which have continuous dye printing or dye transfer features, a continous sheet of dye receptor plastic 50, issues from a feed roll 52, through the dye depositing or printing station 54, around a guide roll 56, to e wind up roll SR, as shown in Figure 10. In the dye depositing station is an ink applying roll 60, in contact with the pattern printing roll 62, which rotates into contact with the dye receptor plastic sheet 50, as it passes through the nip of the pattern roll 62, and the impression roll 64, which forms a pressure nip therewith and assists the transfer of a dye pattern from the pattern roll to the plastic web 50 and the so printed dye pattern dries on the web, in air or by drying means not shown, en route to wind up on the roll 58, as indicated in Figure 10. In a related process, plastic sheet 66 from a stack of such sheets 68 is passed through a printing station 70, dried e.c. in air or at a drying station not shown, and stacked with other printed dye pattern sheets in a stack 72, as shown inFigure 11. The printing station 70 includes one or more dye applying rolls 74 which distributes dyes on a patLern bearing roll 76, the so formed dye pattern being transferred to an intcrniediate or offset roll 78, which prints or deposits the dye pattern on the plastic sheet 66 as It passes trough the nip of the offset roll 78 and the co rotating impression roll 80, as shown in Figure 11. In another dye transfer process embodying the invention, having an intermittent operation, plastic dye. receptor sheet 82, having a dye pattern printed thereon, posit ioneA between teflon release sheets 84 and 86 ride on endless belt 88, between the platens 90 and 92, of a thermal press 94, as shown in Figure 12. The lower platen 92 advantageously is stationary and has a flexible pad 93 covering the major part of its upper surface and both platens 90 and 92 have heating means therein, e.g. electric heating coils, not shown , for controlling the temperature thereof. The upper platen 90 is raised and lowered against the lower platen, by means not shown, to obtain the desired pressure therebetween, as indicated in Figure 12. Spaced from the heating press 94, is cooling press 96, having an upper platen 98 and lower platen 100, advantageously surmounted with a surface pad 102, as shown in Figure 12. The upper and lower platens are cooled e.g. by liauid coils mounted therein not shown and the upper platen 98 is moveable up and down relative to the stationary lower platen 100, to adjust the pressure therebetween as desired. The endless telt P8 is rotated and stopped as desired, by means not shown, which accordingly moves the printed dye receptor plastic sheet 82 and its release sheets 84 and 86 into and through the heating and cooling stations 94 and 96, as desired. In operation, the dye receptor plastic sheet 82 and the release sheets R4 and 86 are advanced on the belt between platens 90 and 92 of the heating station 94. Ore or both of the platens eg the upper platen 90, is heated to the desired temperature eq 350 F, and the upper platen ir. lowered, compressing the sheets 84, R2 and 86 against the now stationary belt 88, the press distribution pad 93 and the lower platen 92, at e.q. 30 psiq, for a desired period, e.q. 3n sccoFns, after which the platen 90 is raised and tte endless belt 88 reactivated to move the plastic sheet 82 and release sheets 84 and 86 into the coding station 96, between thc platens 98 and 100. The belt 88 then stops and the upper platep 98 is lowered into pressure contact with said 3 sheets at a desired pressure, e.g., of 10 pslg and cooling liquid at eg 409 P, is circulated through the coils not shown of at least the upper platen 98, to cool the dye absorbed plastic sheet for the desired period, e.g. 30.seconds. The platen 98 is raised and the endless belt 88 is activated to advance the 3 sheets out of the cooling station to near the end of the endless belt.The release sheets 84 and 86 are then removed to obtain the dye pattern absorbed plastic sheet 83, as shown or indicated in Figure 12 and the cycle is repeated for successive dye printed plastic sheets. It will be recognized that the platen 90 of the heating station 94, shown in Figure 12, steed not exert pressure on the plastic receptor sheet 82 and the release sheets 84 and 86, provided sufficient heat of sublimation is supplied to the dye printed receptor sheet 82.However, the platen 90 preferably does close on such layers to apply heat and pressure thereto for close uniform thermal contact, a reduced heating period, and shape control of the sheet 82 to effect the dye absorption of the invention. Similiarly the dye absorbed receptor sheet may passively cool in air or between the platens of the press of the cooling stations, eg cooing station 96, shown in Figure 12, which platens can be open but are preferably closed for a shorter cooling dwell time and shape control of the dye pattern absorbed plastic sheet. Further the heating station,94, shown in Figure 12, can be replaced with a dielectric heater eg radio freouency station 40 shown in Figure 6, in which the endless belt and dye receptor plastic 82 and release sheets 84 and 86 pass between the spaced plates of such RF station 40, as indicated in Figures 6 and 12. Advartaceously, the belt and such tri sheet assembly are stopped and the RF plates closed thereon eg at 30 psig during the PF heating step. In a more continuous process of the dye transfer method of the present invention, endless belts of teflon 1n4 and 106 trave between the platens of the heating stage 108 and the cooling stage 110 as shown in Figure 13. The heating station 108 can be a thermal press, such as heating staqe 94 described above with respect to Figure 12 or can be a radio frequency transmitter, such as RF station 40 shown in Fiqure 6. The cooling stage 110 can he a cooling press such as cooling press 96, described above in reference to Figure 12. In this method of the invention, dye pattern printed plastic web 112 issues from a roll 114, in close contact with the nip of the endless belts 104 and 106, as indicated in Figure 13.The dye pattern printed plastic sheet 112 and the endless belts 104 and 106, stop for eg 30 seconds at the heating station 108, where heat or heat and pressure closed press are applied to sublime the printed dyes into the plastic web. The heated dye atsorbed web and endless teflon belts 104 and 106 are tben advanced to the cooling stage 110 between the plates thereof and such web and belts are halted eg. for an adeitiona 30 seconds, to cool eg by closed press the dye absorbed plastic web below its softening temperature and to fix the dye pattern on and below the. surface of such plastic web.Of course while one segment of such plastic web is being cooled, another web segment, aft thereof, is teing subiected to heat and dye absorption therein, in a production sequence, as indicated in Figure 13. The cooled and dye pattern absorbed web 113 is then advanced to wind up on wind up roll 115, as shown in Figure 13. As discussed above with respect to Figure 7, a substrate of the same or different material can be positioned between the dye pattern printed plastic sheet 82 and release sheet 86 and processed accordingly, as indicated in Figures 7 and 12, to obtain e laminated or fused dye pattern absorbed product, eg product 45, shown in Figure 8. Accordingly the heat of dye sublimation will be also employed for lamination or fusinq of the dye receptor plastic sheet and its substrate. in like manner, a substrate web 116 issuing from roll 11e, can contact the hottom surface of the dye receptor web 112 and be laminated or fused thereto in the heating station 108, as indicated, in phantom, ip Figure 13, to obtain a thickened, dyeabsorbed product. In yet another process embodying the method. of the invention, thermoplastic extrudate 120 issues from extruder dye 122, around a bondinq drum 124, as shown in Fioure 14.concurrently, a roll of dye pattern printed plastic web 126, the printed siam yawn, issues from the feed roll 12P and into contact with the hot extrudate 120, between the nip of drum 124 and the endless teflon belt 130, as shown in Figure 14. The heat emitted by the extrudate 120 in contact with Lhe dye printed plastic web 126 is sufficient to effect bonding thereto and sublimation and absorption of the dye pattern into the plastic web 126.The fused or lamir.ated dye pattern absorbed web 132 is passed through the cooling stage 134, eg similar to cooling staqe 9h, shown in Figure 12, and the cooled dye pattern absorbed plastic web including the substrate web laminated or fused thereto le web 132, printed side down, passes to wind up, around take up roll 136, as shown in Figure 14. In still another embodiment of the method of the invention, dye pattern printed plastic sheet is dye absorbed and thermoformed. Accordinglytdye pattern printed plastic sheet 140 is positioned by clamps 142 and 144 over vacuum forning mold 146, having vaeuum ducts 14R, as shown in Figure 15. An oven 150, having housing 152 and heater coils 154, 156 and 15P, is lowered over the dye printed plastic sheet 140 and the vacuum mold 146, as shown in Figure 15.The heater coils are turned on, sufficient heat is applied to the printed plastic shunt 140 to soften or nearly soften the . am , causing the printed dyes thereon to sublime into such sheet. Concurrently, vacuum is applied to the vacuum old 146 through the vacuum ports 148, by means not shown, which draws the heated and dye pattern absorbed plastic sheet 140. over and around the mold 146, in close conformity therev1th, as shown in Figure lh. The heater housinq 15n iS raised, the wormed and dye pattern decorated plastic article 160 is cooled, the vacuua pump is turned off and the article 160 is removed from the vacuum mold 146 as a dye pattern absorbed and molded plastic article 160, as shown in Figure 17. Accordingly, Ltbe dye receptor can be ttlermo formed during the dye sublimation step or after the dye sublimation step.Also a previously dye pattern absorbed article can be later preheated apd thermoformed including vacuum or pressure formed into a dye pattern aborbed and formed plastic article. Accordingly the methods of the present Invention provide several processes for dye pattern absorption into plastic articles including webs and sheets as well as molded plastic articles. The dye pattern absorption method of the invention is readily employed with thermoplastic articles eg polystyrene and vinyl sheets abd further applies to thermo set plastic articles, eg polyester. sheets and fiberglass sheets. The heat applied to tie dye pattern printed plastic article or web, sufficient to sublime the dyes thereon is also sufficient to render the surface of the plastic web receptive to dye penetration to a depth of 10 mils or more. Further data on dye pattern absorption into thermoplastic sheets and thermo set plastic sheets is provided in Table I hereinafter. Accordingly, the dye absorption method into plastics of the present invention eliminates certain steps and materials as noted above and includes the following novel steps 1. Direct printing onto the plastic receptor sheet 2. The elimination of a heat transfer paper and the positioning thereof, 3. The elimination of a separator sheet ant ttit positioning thereof, and 4. Heat is applied for a considerably shorter dwell time e.g. seconds. Further the decorated plastic product produced hy the above methods of the present invention is believed to lave deeper colors and sharper definition, even reproducing brushstokes of the original resign over decorated products obtained with the above prior art methods. This is because there 1. no intervening separator sheet to absorb, screen out, deflect or distort even a small portion of t lie dispersed dyes oriqinally applied eq. to n heat transfer paper. Accordingly it is believed that a novel decorated product with a pattern absorbed therein with substantially pure vivid dye hues and wbrushstrokeZ definition and clarity of pattern, is obtained by the methods embodying the present invention. Accordinaly, the present invention provides a method for ready and accurate transfer and absorption of dyes in various colors, prints, patterns, and the like, on and below the plastic surface to be decorated, in a novel, relatively lowcost process, to obtain a dyed plastic product of high clarity reproduction. As discussed above, the so deposited dyes, upon sublimation, penetrate below the surface of the plastic article and are virtually wear proof. The dyes employed herein can be various dyes capable of sublimation at 200 F to son F or more, including those dyes in use on heat transfer payers for dye transfer in the textile industry. Preferred are medium energy dyes which sublime between about 300 F and 500 F. In the methods embodying the present invention, the dye receptor can be any material, such as thermoplastics, which will absorb sublimed dyes and fix them in a durable manner.The dye receptor materials suitable for the present invention include polycarbonates, vinyls, acrylics, polystyrene, A.B.S. Ocrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene and like extrudable polymers as well as t thermo set plastics including polyesters. Tle plastic dye receptor can be an aiticle of vnrious shapes, flat, rounded, angular, or a combination thereof, and can be pronounced three dimensional objects e.g., containers, thermoformed or molded products and tie I ike. or edl bi plastic wobs including sheets, film and or coat Inc or other articles which are receptive to penetration l,y dispersed dyes. Advantagously, ti desired dye. are applied to a printlnq plate or roll havinq the desired pattern engraved, embossed or photo imaged thereon or otherwise placed thereon and the printinq plate is contacted with the dye receptor surface, one or more times, to deposit the desired dye pattern thereon. Further the desired dyes and dye patterns can be deposited on the dye receptor by any suitable means, e.q., by hanA, pen, brush, and the like, in preparation for the dye sublimation step of the present invention. Moreover the dyes can be printed or otherwise deposited on two or sore surfaces of a dye receptor e.q. on opposite sides of a plastic web or sheet and subrectea to the dye sublimation and cooling steps described above to obtain a dye pattern absorbed article on two sides thereof on the s3me or different dye patterns. The dyes can be printed or deposited upon the plastic receptor surface in a ranqe from a fraction of a second to 40 seconds or more, depending upon the complexity of the pattern, the number of dyes, and the number of printing steps employed.The press is desirably aliqned or indexed relative to the plastic receptor for accuracy in employing a sequence of printing steps thereon. A suitable time for the above printing step can, for example, be about 30 seconds. The temperatures necessary to effect dye transfer and absorption in the methods of the present invention have been found to be governed by the temperatures required for dye sublimation of the dyes employed and the temperatures at which the dye receptor surface energy level rises to becor,e susceptible to dye penetration, which can he at or below the softening temperatures therefor. These dye adsorption temperatures have been found to be from 700 to 5n0 F and up, depending upon the above materials employed. A preferred t.ml, rature ranqe in thermal dye sublimation .nd absorption is 3tn to 45n F.After the dye absorption step, the materials are cooled below the dye sublimation temperature and the plastic softening tePperatlarew and a dye decorated plastic product is obtained e.g., a vivid and sharply defines pattern and or printed letter and numbers in a plastic web. The application of the heating stage and the cooling stage in the dye absorption method of the invention, can.each he from a fraction of a second to 2 minutes or more delendinq on the dye receptor being processed and frequently run from 20 to 80 seconds The pressures applied in the heat transfer step of the dyes into the plastic receptor can be from n i.e. no pressure to 100 psig and up and preferably are from 20 to 60 psig. The pressure in the cooling stage can be from 1 to 80 psig, and preferably are from 5 to 40 psig. Where the upper ranges of heat and pressure are applied to the dye deposited plastic receptor e.g., at 400 F and 80 psig, the dyes sublime rapidly so as to practically explode and penetrate into the dye receptor to a depth of several rills, as hereinafter discussed. The dye absorbed plastic receptor is then cooled as stated above, to obtain the dye absorbed product. In the dye sublimation step in a thermal press, such as shown in Figure 4, the dye receptor is covered by a pair of release sheets 34 and 36 of, e.g., teflon, to confine the dyes to the plastic receptor and further to facilitate the separation of the plastic receptor from the press platen after the dye absorption step, as indicated in Figure 4. The release layer can be of other materials, e.g., silicon. Where it is desired to laminate or fuse the reverse side of the dye receptor to another material, the lamination as indicated, can be carried out concurrently with the dye al sorj.t ion step in the above tesperatures ranqe of 200 to 500 F, depending upon the substrate employed. In the applied pressures necessary to effect dye transfer and absorption, 0 to 100 psig has heen found sufficient.Lamination pressures however run considelahly higher, fron 30 to 3,000 psig. Employing such l ressures, in the method of the present invention, thermal dye absorption and lamination of the plastic receptor to a sutstrate occurs concurrently. Where the honded layers are,compatable or of the same material they can fuse into one web where they are different, they bond into a layered laminate web. Tie substrates suitable for laminate base material herein include treated papers, fabrics, plastic materials, including thermolrlasfics and thermoset plastics, e.g., webs, sheet and film, and any other material bondable to the plastic dye receptor. In another method embodying the dye absorption process of the present invention, radio frequency waves are applied to the dye deposited plastic receptor, as discussed above, with respect to Figure 6. These RF waves when matched to the dielectric constant of the plastic receptor sleet, couple with the molecules thereof causing oscillitory or rotational motion thereof, which heats up the plastic and thus the dyes printed thereon to a sublimation temperature, causing the dyes to sublime into the plastic receptor web, as discussed above. The resultant RF heat is generated in the dielectric, the plastic receptor, and in homogeneous materials is a uniform heat, rapidly attained. RF frequencies employed can range from 2 to 90 mHz or more with power output from 1 to 125 kw or more.However to prevent interference with authorized radio communication channels certain known shieldinq procedures are followed. While the dielectric constant of air is 1, the dielectric constant of many plastics ranges from 1 1 2 to to 5 eg at 1 mHz for ABS polearbonate alloy 2.4 to 3.8 polycarbonates 2.92 to 2.93 polystyrene 2.4 to 3.8 and PVC 3.3 to 4.5.Accordingly the RF frequency selected depends upon the dielectric constant of the dye receptor plastic and when properly matched therewith, serves to couple with tulle molecules thereof and raise the temperature of the plastic to a sublimation temperature for the dyes printed thereon. Accordingly for plastic dye receptors having a dielectric constant from 1 1 2 to 5, radio frequency siqnals of eq from 1 ts 100 mHz at a suitable power, 1 to 125 kw, are effective to Icat the dye receptor and to transfer tie dye pattern from the surface to Within the dye receptor web jn a rapid and accurate sublimation process, eq in 2 to 12 seconds. The power of the RF signal varies with the area of the dye receptor, eq for a web 3 x 4 in. 12 sq. in. 6 kw or .5 kw sq in. provides effective dye sublimation. For a larger area dye receptor, eg 25 x 3P in. 95 sq. in. 100 kwatts or slightly less than .1 kw sg in. provides effective dye sublimation. Accordinqly the power reouirements of the RF siqnal appear to diminish per square inch as the area of the dye receptor increases and as indicated herein, has been found to ranoP from about .09 to .5 kw sq in. A suitable pressure range in the RF dye suPZjrstation process, e the press shown in Fioure 6, extends from a fraction to 20 psig, eg a suitable pressure is 5 psiq and the time for applyinq switch pressure ranqes from 1 to 12 seconds or more. As noted, the dye receptor and accompanyirg layers are desirably transferred from the RF dye sublimation stage to a cooling staqe, eg a cooling press. Such coolinq press is desirably closed on the dye receptor itself or in combination with adjacent layers from the RF heating press per Figure 6 at a pressure of a fraction to 20 psig and a suitable pressure is, eq 5 psig, for 1 to 20 seconds or more. The cooling press is thereafter opened and a dye pattern absorbed plastic article obtained. The cooling of the plastic dye receptor below the dye sublimation temperatures fixes the dyes and dye pattern in the receptor and the release sheets or other adjacent layers per Fiqure h are then removed therefrom.. Heating and cooling the dye recelitot under pressure is desirable since such pressure can prevent unwanted deforming of the dye receptor as it undergoes temperature charges above and tticn below its softening temperature. The radio frequency dye absorbed plastic product can be subsequently laminated to one or more substrates by applying heat and pressure as above described. in tie above dye absorption methods, whether by heated press or by RF heating, it is sufficient if the dye receptor is heated from above, where ruch receptor is a web 20 mils thick or 3ess. Where such preceptor has a thickness of greater than 20 mils, either sinoly or in combination with a substrate, it is desirable to heat such webs from below as well, e.q., a few degrees below the softening temperature thereof so that such web or webs are evenly heated during the dye sublimation process and or laminating process and warping of the dye at,sorbed end product is avoided.Fven in the I dye sublimation process, for dye receptors over 20 mils thick, it is well to heat the lower plate or support member for the dye receptor web or webs. to a few degrees below the softening temperature thereof before and during the dye sublimation process to prevent or minimize warpinq of the dye absorbed end product. As previously indicated0 the above methods of the invention of heat press thermal dye absorption and radio freouency dye absorption serve to transmit dye patterns intact into thermoplastics and thermo set plastics. By thermo set plastics as used herein, is included cross linked polymers such as polyester webs, including those under the trade name Nylar , as well as thermocast plastics including cross linked polymers of e.g. glass fiber impreqnated with polyester resin, known as fiberglass. While the methods of the invention produce the unexpected result of transrritting dye patterns of high definition into thermoplastics, e.g., nen cross linked polymers such as polystyrene and vinyl, it is even more un xi erted t hat such dye patterns could also bet transmitted below the surface of cured thermoset plastics. The dye absorption methods of the present irvention permit dyes and dye patterns to he absorbed several Nails into and below the surface of a p astic dye receptor. utii depth of dye penetration will depend upon the nature of the dye rt t i tor plastic, its thickness, Litre nature and recount of the dyes enj loyed, the temperature, pressures, and radio frequencies applied, the duration or length of the dye absorption step and the like. However, accordinq to tile methods of the present invent ion, dye absorption into the various plastic receptors are reqularly obtained from fractions of a sil to 10 mils or more and preferable from 3to 8 mils1 to obtain a highly defined pattern with vivid colors in a wear proof design. The following examples are intended to illustrate the methods of the present invention and the products thereof and should not be construed in limitation thereof. FXAMEXLE 1. A sheet of polystyrene 10 mils thick by 25 x 3 was passed through the nip of an offset printing press, such as shown in Fiqure 11 and a lithograph roll coated will dispersed dyes of various colors in a pattern, such as shown in Figure 9, contacted such sheet and printed the above pattern thereon in less than 2 seconds. The so printed sheet was dried in air at room temperature for 2 hours. The so printed sheet was then placed between a pair of teflon release sheets of slightly larder size and 8 mils thick each and the tri sheet assembly was placed between the platenS of a heating press, e.g., as shown in Figure 12.The press which was heated to 400 F, was closed upon the tri sheet assembly at a pressure of about 30 psig for about 30 seconds and then opened. Tie tri sheet assembly was then conveyed between the platens of the cooling stage 96, shown in Figure 12. The upper platen, being liquid coil cooled to about 50 F, was lowered into a pressure contact of about 5 psig with the tri sheet assembly on the bottom platen for about 30 seconds.The coolinq platen was raised, the tri sheet assembly was conveyed clear of the coolinq press, the release sheets were removed and the plastic web, cooled below its softeninq temperature, displayed a clear pattern of vivid colors wit ii brush stroke definition, absorbed about 6 coils into tie polystyrene, its weal proof design. EXAMPLE 2. Tie above process was repeated with 10 mil polyester film Mylar and a dye penetrated end product was obtained which displayed a clear pattern of vivid colors of high definition, absorbed 7 to 8 mils therein, in a wear proof design. EXAMPLE 3. A sheet of polystyrene of the dimensions of Example 1 and printed accordingly, was placed atop a shect of compatible M of the same dimensions but 7D mils thick and the two layers were placed between 2 teflon release sheets of the size of Example 1. The quadri sheet assenbly was placed between the platens of the heatinq staqe 96, shown in Figure 12, the upper platen 96 was heated to about 400 F and the lower platen was heated to about 280 F, below the softeninq temperature of theAPS layer and the remainder of the process of Example 1 followed. upon removal of the release sheets it was seen that the polystyrene and APS webs had fused into one continuous integral web, about 80 mils thick, with no diseernable strata lines and further that the upper polystyrene portion thereof was penetrated with a clear pattern of vivid colors of high definition, absorbed about 6 mils therein in a wear proof design. EXAMPLE 4. Another 10 nil polystyrene sheet of the dimensions of Example 1 is printed accordinqly. The so printed plastic sheet is placed between a brass plate above and an Bakelite pad below and the tri layer assembly is placed between the platens of a radio frequency press at about 5 psia, reid as shown in Figure 6. The lower press platen is surmounted by a resilient pad also, in tiie manner shown in Figure f.. Ilie polystyrene sheet is determined to have a dielectric constant of 3.1 and an RF of 27.12 MHz at ln0 kw is applied thereto for 5 seconds. The PF press is opened and the polystyrene sheet with a cover sheet of teflon and the Pakelite pad are transferred to a cooling press such as cooling press 3P shown in Figure 5, the plates are closed thereon, eq, at 5 psig. The polystyrene sheet is cooled below its softening temperature and the sublimation temperature tmpc.raturc for tlit dyes. The press is owned and the polystyrene sheet dye receptor separated from the cover sheet and pad, to obtain the plastic sheet with wear proof design The dye pattern absorbed polystyrene sheet displays a clearly defined vivid pattern, absorbed 6 to 7 mils into such web and is very similar in appearance and durability with the decorated plastic web made by the process of Example 1. It has also been found that if the above procedure ofFxample 4 is repeated with a blank or unprinted dye receptor plastic web in contact with the printed side of a dye pattern printed paper, i.e., a heat transfer paper, that is at least one month old and these two layers are positioned between the brass plate 51 above and the Bakelite pad 53 below, which layers are in turn, positioned between the upper plate 55 and the lower plate 57 of the RF press 40, as indicated in Figure as 6, and RF waves are appliedescribed in Example 4,that after the cooling step above described, a dye pattern absorbed plastic web with depth of pattern of 6 to 7 mils is again obtained. The heat transfer paper separates from the dye decorated product without sticking or adherinq to the dye receptor web provided such paper has been aged at least 30 days at room temperature or higher . IF tltt heat transfer paper has been dye printed within such 30 day period, the dye adhesives ar.d carrier, which hod the dye pattern on the paper, can still be activated in the RF press and adllerine of pater to dye receptor occurs. Accordingly, employing the above aged transfer paper l F press method, a flexible vinyl sheet, 3 x 4 Ly 20 mils has been imprinted with a dye pattern on and below Lie surface thereof. Similarly a fiberglass sheet of polyester resin impregnated in fiber g3ass matting, 3 x 4 by 31.25 mils 1 32 thick, received a clear dye pattern therein on and below Lh surface thereof. In each case, the IlF waves were transmitted at 27.12 MHz at 6 rw for 5 seconds and the soheated wets were cooled below dye sublimation temperature in about twp minutes. Tt has further been found that the above aqed heat transfer paper of 30 days or older can only be effectively employed in the above radio frequency dye sublimation process without interleaving a separator sheet, eg of polyethylene. An attempt to use aged heat transfer paper and a dye receptor in a thermal press, eg as shown in Figure 4 results in the adhesion of the heat transfer paper and the dye receptor as previously encountered in the prior art. Accordinqly, employing aged heat transfer parer in contact with a tlank dye receftor web or article and applying RF dielectric heat, as described above, is another method embodying the present invention for producing dye pattern absorbed plastic articles including webs. The following table exemplifies dye pattern absorbed and decorated products made by the methods of the present invention as follows TABLE J.

In each of the above tests and in the above examples, a dye pattern absorbed plastic article was Froduced which displayed a clear pattern of vivid colors of hiQk definition in a wear proof design. Samples of the above dye pattern absorbed plastics were exposed for extended periods to ultra violet light and subjected to testing includinq fadometer tests and were found to exhibit high durability of color retention and pattern definition equivalent to over 2 years in exposure to weather including the sun eg in Florida, Arizona and other states. Accordingly, the dye pattern absorbed articles of the invention are durable against weathering ie. exhibit the above described durability for 6 months or more. Prior art surface printed outdoor signs show significant weathering, ie, fading, blurring, chipping and wear cfF within three months. Thus the dye pat tern absorbed articles of the invention include printed and decorated webs highly suitahle for use as outdoor surfaces including signs.
