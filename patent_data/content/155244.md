# 1 ETHYL 6 FLUORO 7 1H PIRROL 1 YL 1,4 DIHYDRO 4 OXOQUINOLINE 3 CARBOXYLIC ACID PREPARATION AND ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITIES

## Abstract
The title compound 1 ethyl 6 fluoro 7 1 pyrrol 1 yl 1,4 dihydro 4 oxoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid is a quinolone carboxylic acid derivative of oxacin family bearing a fluor ine atom and a pyrrol 1 yl moiety at 6 and 7 position respec tively. It is represented by the following formula Reaction of this compound with diethyl ethoxy methylene malonate and cyclization of the malonate ob tained by heating in diphenyl ether at 120 C resulted in formation of ethyl ester of 6 fluoro 7 1H pyrrol 1 yl quinoline 3 carboxylic acid. Ethylation of this ester with ethyl iodide in the presence of sodium carbonate gave the required 1 ethyl 6 fluoro 7 1H pyrrol 1 yl 1,4 dihydro 4 oxoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid ethyl ester. The title acid exhibits high activity against Gram positive bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Proteus and Pseudo monas, superior to those of nalidixic acid, piromidic acid and pipemidic acid again, its antimicrobial spectrum is some what superior also to that of enoxacin. 1 Ethyl 6 fluoro 7 1H pyrrol 1 yl 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo quinoline 3 carboxylic acid is a new potent fluorinated quin olone antibacterial agent useful in the management of urin ary tract and systemic infections. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of such compound.
