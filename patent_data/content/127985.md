# ARC DEPOSITION OF METAL ONTO A SUBSTRATE

## Abstract
Metal from strip feedstock 3 is arc deposited onto a sub strate 1, being propelled when molten by a gas curtain from a slit 13. The feedstock 3 is melted in regular fashion by an arc 11 struck between it and a helical non consumable electrode 9 rotated on its axis, which is parallel to the leading edge of the feedstock 3. As the electrode 9 rotates, the arc 11 must move along the helix to keep its shortest path, and hence is con strained to traverse the full width of the feedstock 3 repeti tiously.
