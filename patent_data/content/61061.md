# Variable speed rotary power transmission.

## Abstract
A variable speed rotary power transmission including a first variable diameter sheave assembly 64 driven by a power input shaft 14 , and a second variable diameter sheave assembly 60 for driving a power output apparatus 59, 61 . The first sheave assembly 64 drives the second sheave assembly 60 by means of at least one belt 62 . A control system 74, 80, 98, 102, 108, 112, 126, 128, 129 is operably driven by the shaft 14 and coupled to said first and second sheave assemblies 64, 60 for generally inversely varying the effective diameters of said sheave assemblies with respect to each other to vary the drive ratio between said sheave assemblies. Preferably, the transmission also includes a planetary gear train 12 having a cage 26 with at least one planet gear 32 meshed between a ring gear 56 and a sun gear 38 for orbital motion about an axis 50 common to the ring gear 56 and the sun gear 38 . A driven output shaft 16 is connected to the sun gear 38 and input shaft 14 rotatably drives cage 26 , while the power output apparatus drives the ring gear 56 .
