## Description
CLAVULANIC ACID DERIVATIVES, THEIR PREPARATION AND USE This invention relates to a novel series of 9 heterocyclyl deoxyclavulanic acid derivatives, to a method for their preparation, to their use as antibacterial and P lactamase inhibitory agents and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds. British Patent Specification Number 1508977 discloses clavulanic acid and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof. It has now been discovered that derivatives of clavulanic acid may be prepared that have a heterocyclyl group at the 9 position in place of the hydroxyl group. Thus the present invention provides a compound of the formulaEMI1.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof wherein R is a hydrogen atom 2 or a C16 alkyl group, R is a hydrogen atom or a C16 alkyl group, R is a hydrogen atom or a C1 6 alkyl group, or Rê and R together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a benzene ring which optionally is substituted by a C1 6 alkyl, C1 6 alkoxy or hydroxy group and X is a sulphur or oxygen atom or is a group NR4 wherein R4 is a hydrogen atom or a C1 6 alkyl group. Suitable values for R1, R2 and R when independent include those selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. Of these the hydrogen atom and the methyl group are preferred. Suitably Rê and R together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a benzene ring which is optionally substituted by C1 6 alkyl, C1 6 alkoxy or a hydroxy group. When such a benzene ring is formed s suitably it is not substituted, or it is substituted by a group selected from methoxy, ethoxy, methyl, ethyl and hydroxy. Suitably X is a sulphur atom thus forming either a thiophene or thionaphthene ring system. Alternatively X is an oxygen atom thus forming either a furan or benzofuran ring system. In a further aspect X is a .NR group thus forming a pyrrole or indole ring system. Preferably R is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group. A favoured sub group of compounds is that of the formula II EMI3.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof wherein XÚ is an oxygen or sulphur atom or a NH or N CH3 group R5 is a hydroeggen atom or a methyl group and R6 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group. Preferably one of R5 and R6 is a hydrogen atom and the other is a methyl group. 6Alternatively R and R are independently both hydrogen atoms. Examples of the compounds of this invention include 9 pyrr 2 yldeoxyclavulanic acid, 9 1 methyl pyrr 2 yldeoxyclavulanic acid, 9 3 methyl thien 2 yldeoxyclavulanic acid, 9 5 methyl fur 2 yldeoxyclavulanic acid, 9 3 methyl benzofur 2 yldeoxyclavulanic acid, 9 indol 3 yldeoxyclavulanic acid, 9 thionaphthyldeoxyclavulanic acid, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Suitably the compounds of the formulae I II are presented as the free acid but more favourably they are presented in the form of a salt. Suitable salts include the alkali and alkaline earth metal salts such as the sodium, magnesium, potassium or calcium salts. Other suitable salts include the ammonium salt and substituted ammonium salts such as the methylamine, ethylamine, dimethylamine, tertiarybutylamine and tetramethylammonium salts. Particularly suitable salts include the sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts of these the sodium and potassium are preferred. The compounds of the formulae I II may be provided as in vivo hydrolysable esters Such esters are those which hydrolyse in the human body to produce the parent acid. Suitable in vivo hydrolysable esters include those esters known to give in vivo hydrolysis in penicillins. Thus suitable esters include those of the formula i CO O CHR7 OCOP8 i wherein P is a hydrogen atom, or a methyl or phenyl group is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenyl group, an alkyl group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms substituted by a phenyl group, an alkoxy group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenoxy group, or an alkoxy group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms substituted by a phenyl group or.R7 is attached to R to form a 1,2 diphenylene or 4,5 dimethoxy 1,2 diphenylene group. Favourably R7 is hydrogen. When R7 is hydrogen suitably P is selected from methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, tert butyl, phenyl, benzyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n propyloxy and isopropyloxy. Preferably 8 is tert butyl. Favourably R7 and R8 are joined so that the ester is a phthalidyl or 3,4 dimethoxyphthalidyl ester. Of these esters those favoured as in vivo hydrolysable esters are the acetoxymethyl, acetoxyethyl, phthalidyl, ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl esters. The in vivo hydrolysable nature of the ester may be confirmed by administration to an animal such as a mouse or rat and determination of the presence of a compound of the formula I or a salt thereof in the blood or urine of the animal. Alternatively hydrolysis in human blood or serum may be determined. In another aspect the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable forms of the compositions of this invention include tablets, capsules, creams, syrups, suspensions, solutions, reconstitutable powders and sterile forms suitable for injection or infusion. Such compositions may contain conventional pharmaceutically acceptable materials such as diluents, binders, colours, flavours, preservatives and disintegrants in accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice in the manner well understood by those skilled in the art of formulating antibiotics. Injectable or infusable compositions of salts of a compound of the formula I are particularly suitable as high tissue levels of a compound of the formula I can occur after administration by injection or infusion.Thus, one preferred composition aspect of this invention comprises a salt of a compound of the formula I in sterile form. Unit dose compostions comprising a compound of the formula I or a salt or ester thereof adapted for oral administration form a further preferred aspect of this invention. The compound of the formula I or its salt or ester may be present in the composition as sole therapeutic agent or it may be present together with other therapeutic agents such as a penicillin or cephalosporin. Suitable penicillins or cephalosporins for inclusion in the compositions of this invention include benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, carbenicillin, azidocillin, propicillin, ampicillin, epicillin, ticarcillin, cyclacillin, cefatriazine, pirbenicillin, a sulphonyloxybenzylpenicillin cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, cephalexin, cephacetrile, cephamandole nafate, cephapirin, cephradine,4 hydroxycephalexin, cefaparole, cephaloglycine, and other well known penicillins and cephalosporins or pro drugs therefor such as hetacillin, metampicillin, 4 acetoxyampicillin, the acetoxymethyl, ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or phthalidyl esters of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, amoxycillin or cephaloglycine, or the phenyl, tolyl or indanyl a esters of carbenicillin or ticarcillin. Such compounds are frequently used in the form of a salt or hydrate. Naturally if the penicillin or cephalosporin present in the composition is not suitable for oral administration then the composition will be adapted for parenteral administration. When present in a pharmaceutical composition together with a penicillin or cephalosporin, the ratio of a compound of the formula I or its salt or ester present to penicillin or cephalosporin present may vary over a wide range of ratios, for example 3 1 to 1 10 and advantageously may be from 2 1 to 1 5 for example, 1 1 to 1 3. The total quantity of antibacterial agents present in any unit dosage form will normally be between 50 and 1500 mg and will usually be between 100 and 1000 mg. Compositions of this invention may be used for the treatment of infections on inter alia, the respiratory tract, the urinary tract and soft tissues and mastitis in cattle. Normally between 50 and 3000mg of the compound of the invention will be administered each day of treatment but more usually between 100 and 1000 mg of the compounds of the invention will be administered per day, for example as 1 6 doses, more usually 2 4 doses. The penicillin or cephalosporin in synergistic compositions of this invention will normally be present up to or at approximately the amount at which it is conventionally used. Particularly favoured compositions of this invention will contain from 150 1000 mg of amoxycillin, ampicillin or a pro drug therefor and from 50 500 mg of a compound of the formula I or a salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof and more suitably from 200 500 mg of amoxycillin, ampicillin or a pro drug therefor and from 50 250 mg of a compound of the formula I or a salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof. The materials present in such compositions may be hydrated if desired, for example ampicillin trihydrate or amoxycillin trihydrate may be employed. The weights of the antibiotics in such compositions are expressed on the basis of antibiotic theoretically available from the composition and not on the basis of the weight of pro drug. The compounds of the formula I may be prepared by the arylation of an ester of clavulanic acid. Thus in a further aspect the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof which process comprises the reaction of an ester of clavulanic acid of the formula III EMI9.1 with a compound of the formula IV EMI9.2 wherein X, RÚ, Rê and R are as defined in relation to formula I in the presence of a catalyst and thereafter i converting any ester that is not in vivo hydrolysable into a free acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester ii optionally converting any in vivo hydrolysable ester into a free acid, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or different in vivo hydrolysable ester. By the term a catalyst used herein we mean an entity that catalyses the alkylation reaction of an aromatic ring by an alcohol. Preferably the catalyst employed is one which is knownto catalyse reactions known as Friedel Crafts reactions. Suitable catalysts include aluminium trichloride, zinc chloride, zinc bromide, antimony pentachloride, ferric choride, stannic chloride, boron trifluoride etherate and chemical equivalents thereof. Of these boron trifluoride is preferred, for example as the etherate. The position at which the 9 deoxyclavulanic acid moiety becomes attached to the heterocycle is influenced by the nature of the heterocycle and also by the nature of the substituents P1 R and R3. In general if the compound of the formula IV is monocyclic the 9 deoxyclavulanate moiety will attach to the carbon atom adjacent to the heteroatom i.e. the 2 or the 5 position in formula V EMI11.1 if the 2 and the 5 positions are blocked then the point of attachment will be the 3 or 4 position. If the compound of the formula IV is an indole or thionaphthene then the likely point of attachment for the 9 deoxyclavulanate moiety is the 3 position see formula VI EMI11.2 unless of course this is blocked in which case the 2position is favoured.For the benzofuran ring system it is likely that the point of attachment of the 9 deoxyclavulanate moiety is the 2 position unless of course this is blocked in which case the 3 position is favoured. The reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a solvent, though the identity of the particular solvent selected is not critical to the success of the reaction provided that it is able to form a homogeneous solution of the compound of the formula IV and the ester of clavulanic acid and is substantially inert to the starting materials, product and catalyst. Suitable solvents may be selected by trial and error.We have found generally that the reaction may be conveniently carried out in non polar organic solvents such as halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride and ethylene chloride. The temperature at which the reaction is carried out depends upon the particular ester and heterocycle which have been selected and upon the nature of the catalyst. Generally, the reaction is carried out at moderate temperatures to low temperatures, i.e. less than 50 C and as low as 70 C. In order to prevent side reactions, it is generally conventient to cool the reagents to a temperature of 0 C or below prior to mixing, to mix the reagents while cold and thereafter maintain the reaction mixture at a temperature between 0 C and 30 C. It is of course understood that best results are obtained when reactions of the type described here are carried out under an atmosphere of dry air or a dry inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. The ester of the compound I produced may be isolated from the reaction mixture by any standard method such as fractional crystallisation, countercurrent separation or chromatography. We have found ,that it is most convenient to separate the desired product b fjy column chromatography. Any convenient ester of clavulanic acid may be used in the process of this invention Since it is frequently desirable to form a salt of compounds I , the ester of clavulanic acid employed is preferably one which is readily converted to the parent, acid or its salt by mild methods of hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis. For example see the disclosures of British Patent Specification Numbers 1508977 and 1508978. Particularly suitable esters of clavulanic acid for use in this process include the methoxymethyl or methyl esters, or an optionally substituted benzyl ester, optionally substituted in the para position by a lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or nitro group or by a halogen atom. A preferred ester for use in this process is benzyl clavulanate. Suitable methods for hydrolysing esters of compounds I include mild base hydrolysis in aqueous solution. The reaction may be effected by maintaining the ester at a pH of 7.5 to 9.5 until hydrolysis is complete. Most suitably a readily hydrolysable ester such as the methoxymethyl ester is employed in this process. The pH may be maintained in the desired range in a pH stat by the addition of a solution of a base such as LiOH, NaOH, KOH, NaHC03 or the like at a rate that prevents accumu lation of excess base which would cause the pH to increase unacceptably, or by the use of a suspension of finely divided Ca OH 2, Mg OH 2, MgO, MgC03 or the like. Other bases which may be employed for hydrolysis include Ba OH 2,Sr OH 2 and the like. Suitable methods of hydrogenolysis of esters of compounds I include hydrogenation in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. Suitable hydrogenolysable esters are benzyl and substituted benzyl esters discussed above. The pressure of hydrogen used in the reaction may be low, medium or high, but in general an approximately atmospheric or slightly super atmospheric pressure of hydrogen is preferred. The transition metal catalyst employed is preferably palladium on charcoal. The hydrogenation may be effected in any inert solvent in which the ester is soluble such as tetrahydrofuran or the like. If this hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a base then a salt of compounds I is produced.Suitable bases for inclusion include NaHC03, KHC03, Na2C03, K2C03, CaC03, MgC03, LiHC03, NH4OCOCH3, Mg 0COCH3 2, Mg OCOH 2 and the like. If no base is present then hydrogenation leads to the preparation of an acid within formula I which may then be neutralised if desired to yield a salt. Suitable bases which may be used to neutralise acids within formula I includeLiOH, NaOH, NaHC03, KOH, Ca OH 2, Ba OH 2, MgO, Mg OH 2, NH4OH and N C2H5i3. The lithium salts of compounds I tend to be more easily prepared in pure crystalline form than other salts of compounds I . It is therefore often convenient to first form the lithium salt and then convert this into a further salt by ion exchange, for example by passing a solution of the lithium salt through a bed of a cation exchange resin in sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium or like form. Suitable cation exchange resins include Amberlite IR 120 and equivalent resins. The salts of acids I may be converted to esters in conventional manner, for example by reaction with a reactive halide in solution in dimethylformamide or like solvent. Esters may similarly be prepared by the reaction in an inert solvent of an acid I with an alcohol in the presence of a condensation promoting agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. In general salts of the compounds I above are prepared from the free acid by known methods as disclosed in British Patent Specification Number 1508977 for the preparation of clavulanic acid salts. Similarly, esters of compounds I are prepared from the free acid by known methods as disclosed in British PatentSpecification Number 1508978 for the preparation of clavulanic acid esters.
