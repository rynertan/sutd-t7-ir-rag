# Improved process for the preparation of polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates.

## Abstract
Addition of controlled amounts of water to the reaction mixture produced by phosgenation of a mixture of polymethylene polyphenyl polyamines and like polyamines produced by condensation of formaldehyde and aromatic amines prior to complete removal of excess phosgene gives rise to the corresponding polymethylene polyphenyl polyiso cyanates having significantly improved properties. Not only is the color of the product, and of polyurethane foams prepared therefrom, significantly lighter but the proportion of higher molecular weight products is significantly less and the viscosity is less. No undesirable by products are intro duced into the polyisocyanate as a result of the process.
