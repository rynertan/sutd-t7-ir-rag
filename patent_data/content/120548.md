# Improved process of making electrochemical electrodes and electrodes made thereby.

## Abstract
A process for making an improved electrode by providing on a conductive current distributor layers of active and hyd rophobic materials, uniting these materials together with suf ficient force to lock them together and subsequently roll bonding the resulting preformed assembly to form the finished electrode.
