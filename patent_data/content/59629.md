Preferably the flow is reversed by connecting the element to drain. The elements may be hollow elongate elements and they may be disposed such that during filtering fluid flows outwardly through their walls, In this latter case the inside of each element is connected to drain for reverse flow. The arrays may be generally circular and are preferably coaxial. The flow reversing means may comprise a pair of relatively rotatable pipes arranged to succes . sively sweep the inlet ends of the elements in their respective array. Preferably the pipes are motor driven in which case the pipes may be coaxially mounted on a rotatable driven drain conduit at the level of outlets in the wall of the drain conduit and means may be provided for releasably drivingly engaging first one pipe to the conduit and then other pipe, the arrangement being such that in the engaged position each pipe debouches into the conduit and in the disengaged position flow through the disengaged pipe or pipes is prevented. The filter element inlets may be formed in a wall in which case, in the disengaged position, each pipe is located with its inlet end closed off by the wall.

In any of these cases the components may be mounted on a perforated cylinder and means may be provided for allowing manual partial release of the components for cleaning. Any of the filter means of the aforementioned apparatus or any of the aforementioned filters may include a filter element as defined above, The invention can be performed in a number of ways, specific embodiments of which, with modifications, will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 isa diagrammatic plan of an air conditioning apparatus according to the invention Figure 2 is a part cut away side view of a filter for use in the apparatus of Figure 1 Figure 3 is an enlarged part sectional view of a filter element for use in the filter of Figure 2 Figure 4 is an end view of the filter element, when viewed on the arrow A, but on a reduced scale Figure 5 is an enlarged scrap section taken along the line IV IV in Figure 4 and Figure 6 is an enlarged scrap view on the arrow B in Figure 3. The air conditioning apparatus shown inFigure 1 broadly comprises a chiller or refrigerator generally indicated at 10, a heat exchanger 11 connected across the outputs of the chiller 10 and disposed in an air duct 12, and and air tower cooling circuit generally indicated at 13 for cooling the chiller 10 and connectable by pipes 14 and 15 and valves 16 and 17 to supply cooling liquid to the heat exchanger 11. A number of temperature detectors 18 are disposed throughout the system to supply temperature readouts to a microprocessor control system not shown . An enthalpy detector 19 is located in the air duct 12, which is for the purpose of this description the main air intake duct for the building being served by the apparatus, The output of the enthalpy detector is also fed to the control system. The control system is arranged to operate the apparatus in one of three modes, in accordance with the inputs to the system. In the first mode valves 16 and 17 are adjusted to connect the chiller 10 alone across the heat exchanger 11 circuit 13 merely serving to cool the chiller. In the second mode the air cooling tower circuit 13 alone is converted to the heat exchanger 11 and the chiller is isolated and switched off. In the third mode valves 16 and 17 are arranged to allow a proportion of the liquid from the air cooling tower circuit 13 to flow through the heat exchanger 11, whilst simultaneously ermitting operation of the chiller. The mode selected by the control system depends on a number of sectors such as the enthalpy, or alternatively the wet bulb temperature, of the air entering the duct 12, the temperature of the cooling liquid in the circuit 13, including the temperature of the return flow liquid, the temperature existing in the building a measure of which can be obtained by monitoring the enthalpy of the output air from the building , the temperature desired in the building or parts thereof and the economic operating ranges of the particular equipment in use. For any set of conditions the control system is programmed to operate the apparatus for minimum energy consumption commensurate with maintaining the desired psychometric conditions within the building. The control system may also be arranged to control the chiller so that the temperature of the chill liquid leaving the chiller varies inversely with the external environmental temperature in such a way as to maintain the highest possible chill water temperature which can result in the desired air temperature in duct 12. As the chiller 10 is responsible for the major proportion of the energy consumption of the system, it will be appreciated that the use of the apparatus in the third mode will reduce the energy costs of the apparatus as it makes it possible to obtain partial cooling of the cooling liquid by passing it through the air cooling tower 20 before the environmental temperature has dropped sufficiently for the tower to cool all the liquid. When the apparatus is operated in its second or third modes liquid, which has passed through the air cooling tower 20,is fed through the refrigerator 10 and or the heat exchanger 11. Such water is often contaminated and it is necessary to filter this water for example by the strainer or filter 21 in pipe 14. Alternatively the filter may be placed in circuit 13 downstream of the cooling tower 20.In this position it also serves to clean the cooling tower circuit liquid during the first mode of operation preventing a bit build up of contamination. Details of filter 21 ,will be discussed below. A bypass 22 is provided in cooling tower circuit 13 to allow the temperature of the liquid in this circuit to be controlled by mixing in uncooled liquid. A valve 23 in this line is controlled by the control system. Preferably the filter 21, valves 16 and 17 and the control system are assembled in a modular unit, which can beincarpor into an existing chiller system having an air cooling tower. The module may also include operating parameter displays and alarm circuits for giving audible and or visual signals when safe levels are exceeded by one or more operating parameters. As the filter 21 will become progressively contaminated it is desirable to use a filter, which can be back washed without interrupting the normal function of the system. Typically such filters include an array of filter elements,which can be back washed singly or impairs, whenever the pressure difference across them exceeds a given value. A suitable detector is shown at 21a. The output of the detector can be fed to the control system and back washing can be superintended by the control system. This is important because in existing systems if the back washing is ineffective, as can occur if water is heavily contaminated, the back washing cycle can continue indefinitely draining down the whole, system. In the apparatus of Figure 1 a level detector 24 is provded in the reservoir 25 of the cooling tower 20.This detector enables the lost liquid to be replenished and further can provide an override back wash signal to the control system to prevent excessive draining of the system. In cases where the user s water supply is metered it can be economic to drain the back wash water into a tank from where it can be cleaned and recirculated into reservoir 25 on demand. Further a heat exchanger can be incorporated into the tank to provide another source of cold, or alternatively a heat source for other purposes, depending on the operating conditions at back wash. Figure 2 shows one example of a suitable filter 21 for use in the system. The filter comprises an inlet header 50, an outlet header 51 and interconnecting filter tubes 52, arranged in a circular array. Each filter tube 52 contains a generally cylindrical element 53, In normal operation fluid flows as shown in solid line from an inlet 54 in header 50 into tubes 52, through the walls of elements 53, from outside to inside, into the outlet header 5l to outlet 55, The inlet end of each tube 52 engages a seal plate 57 around respective frusto conical apertures 58,The apertures 58, together with restrictors 59 mounted on the ends of the filter elements 53, define an annular divergent inlet passage 60 to take the flow of fluid to the peripheries of the elements 53, Each restrictor 59 is generally frusto conical and has an annular peripheral flange 6 Daaround its larger downstream end. The flange6s0.a as can best be seen inFigures 3 to 5 is formed with slots 61 spaced in an annulus around the flange and having upstanding guide elements 62 on their downstream side for imparting a swirl to the fluid flowing through the slots 61. The swirling of the fluid causes it to be pushed along the length of the filter element 53 to provide a generally even flow distribution over the length of the element 53. Referring to Figure 3 each element 53 comprises a perforated hollow cylinder 63 on which is mounted a helical spring 64. The spring 64 is V shaped in crosssection and is held in compression between end flanges 65 on the cylinder 63, such that the adjacent portions of the spring are urged together, As can be seen inFigure 6 the spring 64 is formed with spaced lateral indentations 66, which engage the adjacent portion of the spring, when it is compressed, and hence define a filter gap 67 of known dimensions say 1 5000th inch , When fluid flows in the solid line direction,the pressure of the fluid acts in a sense to open the arms holding the spring in its filtering mode. As filtering progresses particles will become trapped in the gaps 67 causing a pressure drop across the gaps causing detector 21a to initiate back wash. In this mode the fluid flows in the opposite direction, and acts on the opposite side of J the V s i.e. in a sense to close them. This results in the size of the gaps 67 being increased and the trapped particles are released. In an alternative embodiment the spring may have a diamond cross section. Still further the spring may be replaced by a stack of suitably shaped components axially biased together. For example the components may comprise shallow hollow frusto cones having peripheral wings, which are inclined in the opposite sense to the body of their respective component. Appropriately located spacers are formed on each component so that when the components are arranged in a stack in oppositely facing abutting pairs, the spacers provide filtering gaps 37 between the elements. To enable the elements to be back washed a discharged tube 68 is provided. The tube 68 extends axially from a central aperture in the seal plate 57, through outlet header 51, to a drain 69, via a control valve 70. A U shaped connecting pipe 71 is mounted for rotation about the axis of the tube 68 and is slidingly and sealing engaged at each end on the seal plate 57, such that as it rotates it successively connects the apertures 58 to the tube 68, causing a pressure reversal in the filter tubes 52 and hence causing the elements in the tubes to be back washed. The pipe 71 is mounted for rotation on a hinged door 72 of inlet header 50 by a cylindrical casing 73, A motor 74 is mounted on the door 72 by a gear box 75, which is coupled to the pipe 71 by a drive 76, which is enclosed by the casing 73. When the detector 21a detects a back wash condition it causes a single cycle of the motor 75, andhenceof the pipe 71, and opens the valve 70. At the end of a cycle the outer end of the pipe 71 engages the plate 57 in a rest position between two apertures 58, so that all the tubes 52 are available for filtering. The door 72 is hinged, at 77, such that the pipe 71 and the casing 73 can be swung right out of the header 50. The plate 57 is quick releasably mounted on the header so that it to can be removed allowing ready access to the filter elements 53. Preferably one flange 65 is movable outwardly axially to allow partial release of the spring 64 to easy cleaning of the filter element.In any case causing the fluid to flow from outside to inside, which is the reverse of the normal configuration, greatly reduces the cleaning time required. In some cases it may be desirable to increase the number of tubes 52, by having inner and outer arrays in which case two back wash coupling pipes may be provided. It will be appreciated that the inlet 54 may be located tangentially of the header 50, causing the incoming liquid to flow in a vortex. This vortex may introduce sufficient swirl into the flow into the filter tubes 52 to allow the flange 60a to be omitted.Indeed, catch plates not shown may be attached to the header wall to collect large particles thrown to the outside of the vortex. The flange 65 may be enlarged and bent up at 80 to define an annular cup, which will serve to clear debris from the tube 52, when the filter element 53 is removed for cleaning, The element 53 may be resiliently held in the tube 52 by a compressible ring 81.
