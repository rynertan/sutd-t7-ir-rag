# A pressure transducer.

## Abstract
A differential pressure gauge 10 utilises a piston mem ber 18 provided with a series of grooves 19 right around it, so that the piston member 18 itself forms the rack of a rack and pinion device pinion 22 for converting linear displacement of the piston member into rotary displacement of the pinion. For sensitivity and accuracy, the seal between the piston member 18 and the passage 13 is a hard surface to hard surface engagement between substantial total hard surface areas at any one time of the passage 13 and the piston member 18, including regions of the surface area of the piston member 18 intermediate mutually adjacent end ones of the grooves 19. In this way, the gauge is insensitive to the base pressure, there being no soft seals to deform under pressure. A magnetic coupling is used through the wall of the housing, which can thus be made completely pressure tight. One embodiment indicates a reverse differential press ure by allowing the piston to travel beyond the normal end position upon overcoming the preload of a second spring.
