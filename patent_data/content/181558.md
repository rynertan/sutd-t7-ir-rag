A foldable mast 6 is provided such that the mast in its erected position, forces bearing wheels 95 against the opposite side of the pipe to force the chassis wheels into firm frictional engage ment with the pipe so that the vehicle can traverse vertical pipe sections. The chassis also carried a three axis remote manipulator 100 with remotely controlled video cameras 110 and a sensor to sense distance travelled.
