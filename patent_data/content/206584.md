## Description
This invention relates to the art of electronic devices, and more particularly to a new and improved surface mountable electronic device. One area of use of the present invention is in mounting electronic devices to circuit cards or boards, although the principles of the present invention can be variously applied. Electronic circuit cards or boards have circuit paths provided on a surface thereof. It is necessary to connect the extending leads of an electronic device, to the board and to the paths to provide both an electrical connection to the board. Conventionally, this is accomplished by providing small apertures in the board through which the leads of the device extend and are soldered therein in a manner providing electrical mechanical connections. In recent times, surface mountable devices have become increasingly desired and requested. Briefly, such devices have electrodes rather than leads and are mounted directly on the circuit paths on the board and thereby avoid the need for apertures in the board. It would be highly desirable to provide a surface mountable electronic device in a manner utilizing the known and proven techniques for making leaded electronic devices. Japanese published patent application JP A 59 144 108 describes a surface mountable device comprising an inductor having a core with a winding on the core and collars at the ends of the core. The core is encapsulated in a right parallelepiped body of resin, the longitudinal axes of said body and core being parallel to one another. A terminal at each end of the body has a portion lying flat against the end face of the body, a portion extending inwards through the encapsulation and hooked to one of the collars, and a portion lying flat against the mounting surface of the body. Each end of the winding is connected to one respective terminal and each terminal has a cross sectional area greater than that of the winding end connected thereto. The portion lying flat against the end face of the body has a surface area less than the surface area of said end and is elongate in shape. The portion lying flat against the mounting face is elongated rectangular in shape having a longitudinal axis extending perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of said body and having a length which, it appears from the drawings, may be slightly greater than the width thereof. A disadvantage of this device is that the inductor cannot be made by conventional techniques for making electronic devices having extending leads. A further disadvantage is that the device can be mounted in only one orientation. It is an object of this invention to provide a surface mountable electronic device which utilizes known and proven techniques for making electronic devices having extending leads and then adapts the same to a surface mountable device having spaced electrodes which is mountable in two orientations and has significant mechanical stability when mounted. This invention consists in a surface mountable electronic device comprising The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Referring now to Figures 1 and 2 there is shown a surface mountable electronic device generally designated 10 according to one embodiment of the present invention. Device 10 includes a discrete electronic device 12 comprising a body 14 and a pair of spaced apart lead wires leads 16, 18 extending out from body 14 in generally different directions. The discrete electronic device is an inductor wherein body 14 includes a core 20 and a winding 22 extending along core 20 and secured at each end to a corresponding one of the leads 16, 18. The leads 16, 18 are brazed or soldered, such as at 24, to terminations of winding 22. Core 20 can be provided with a longitudinally extending slot 26 to facilitate retention of winding 22 on core 20. Advantageously, the device 12 in the form of an inductor is manufactured by known, conventional and proven techniques. In other words, the surface mountable device 10 of the present invention is made in a manner which does not require any modification in the manufacture of the discrete electronic device thereof which is rendered surface mountable. In the device shown, inductor 12 has an axis coincident with the longitudinal axis of core 20 which is generally cylindrical in shape and leads 16,18 extend in opposite directions along the axis. The surface mountable device 10 of the present invention further comprises a body generally designated 30 of electrical insulating material encapsulating body 14 and the leads 16, 18 of the discrete electronic device. Insulating body 30 has first and second ends 32, and 34, respectively, and a mounting surface 36 extending between the ends. In the device shown, body 30 is elongated having a longitudinal axis and ends 32,34 are disposed in spaced apart planes each substantially perpendicular to the body longitudinal axis. Body 30 is in the form of a rectangular solid wherein ends 32,34 are planar and including four planar, orthogonally disposed sides 38,40,42 and 44 extending between ends 32,34. The sides 38,40,42 and 44 comprise sections of mounting surface 36 in a manner which will be described. In the device shown, the electronic device 12 is located in body 30 such that the axis of device 12 is substantially coincident with the longitudinal axis of body 30, and leads 16 and 18 extend along the axis and are disposed substantially perpendicular to the ends 32 and 34, respectively. Leads 16 and 18 terminate adjacent the ends 32 and 34, respectively and ends 32,34 are spaced from the corresponding ends of body 14 of device 12 in a manner which will be described. By way of example, in an illustrative device, body 30 is molded of epoxy. The surface mountable device 10 of the present invention further comprises first and second electrode means 48 and 50, respectively, on the first and second ends 32 and 34, respectively, of the body 30. Each of the electrode means 48,50 includes an end portion on the corresponding end 32,34 of the body 30 and in electrical contact with the corresponding one of leads 16,18. Each of the electrode means 48,50 further includes a contact portion extending along the mounting surface 36 for making electrical connection to a circuit having a portion defined on a surface to which device 10 is mountable. The first and second electrode means 48 and 50 are identical, and for convenience in description only electrode 48 will be described in detail, it being understood that the description applies also to electrode 50. The end portion of each electrode means 48,50 has a surface area less than the surface area of the corresponding body end 32,34 on which the electrode end portion is located. The electrode end portion is elongated in shape, extending from the termination of the corresponding one of the leads 16,18 along the end of the body to the junction of the end 32 and the mounting surface 36 at which junction the electrode end portions meets the electrode contact portion. In addition, the elongated end portion of electrode means 48 has a width and length such that the cross sectional area thereof is substantially no less than the cross sectional area of the wire of winding 22 for a reason which will be described. In the device shown, the end portion of electrode means 48 includes a plurality of sections, in the present illustration four sections 56, 58, 60 and 62 each being elongated in shape and extending from a central or common region 64 coincident with the end of lead 16. The sections 56, 58, 60 and 62 are in angularly spaced relation on body end 32, in particular spaced at about right angles to each other, and each extends to the junction of end 32 and mounting surface 36 where it meets a corresponding contact section as will be described. The sections 56, 58, 60 and 62 are rectangular in shape, of equal length and of equal lateral dimension or width. Accordingly each section 56, 58, 60 and 62 has substantially parallel side edges and the side edges of angularly adjacent sections meet at right angles. The cross sectional area of each of the sections 56,58 , 60 and 62 is substantially no less than the cross sectional area of wire of winding 22. Thus, there is one of the sections 56, 58, 60 and 62 for each of the sides 38, 58, 60 and 62 being in orthogonal relation. In the device shown, the contact portion of electrode means 48 includes a plurality of spaced apart sections, in the present illustration four sections 66, 68, 70 and 72 extending from the corresponding electrode end portion sections 56, 58, 60 and 62, respectively and located on the sides 38, 40, 42 and 44, respectively, of body 30. Thus there is one contact portion section on each face of body 30, and each section is spaced from the neighboring section on an adjacent face of body 30. In the device shown, each of the contact sections 66, 68, 70 and 72 is elongated rectangular in shape having a longitudinal axis disposed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of body 30. Each section 66, 68 70 and 72 has a length greater than the width of the corresponding end portion sections 56, 58, 60 and 62, respectively, but less than the width or lateral dimension of the corresponding sides 38, 40 42 and 44, respectively, of body 30. In the illustrative device shown, the length of each section 66, 68, 70 and 72 is greater than the width of each section 56, 58, 60 and 62. the width of each section 66, 68, 70 and 72 is selected to provide adequate contact area. Furthermore, the contact sections 66, 68, 70 and 72 adjacent end 32 of body 30 are in alignment with the corresponding contact sections of electrode means 50 adjacent body end 34. Thus, contact section 66 is in alignment with contact section 76 of electrode means 50 which is also on side 38 and is adjacent end 34. Similarly, contact section 68 is in alignment with contact section 78 which is also on side 40 and adjacent end 34. As a result, any of the sides 38, 40, 42 and 44 can serve as mounting surface for device 10 since a pair of aligned contact portions is on each side. In the inductor of Figs. 1 and 2, core 20 can be of phenolic material, powdered iron or ferrite material. There are several important design considerations which must be taken into account because of problems which can arise if the magnetic field of the inductor is interrupted. The molded epoxy of body 30 is dimensioned in a manner such that the spacing is provided between each end of core 20 and the corresponding ends 32 and 34 of body 30. This space provides an area for the magnetic lines of force or flux from winding 22 to travel through with little interference from the metal electrodes 48, 50 on the ends. In particular, the corresponding end of core 20 is located inwardly of the inner edge of the electrode contact section which extends along the mounting surface of body 30. The foregoing is to avoid a reduction in the Q of the inductor which otherwise could occur if the end of core 20 was too close to the corresponding metal electrode. The area of metalization on the side of the component that is intended for surface mounting, i.e. the area of the electrode contact portions which are on the mounting surface 36, is selected to maximize the area for mounting while maintaining enough distance between adjacent areas or contact sections to avoid shorting. Shorting from side to side, i.e. between adjacent contact sections, would act like a shorted turn of the inductor and thereby reduce the Q. The cross sectional area of the most narrow section of the end portion of each electrode means 48, 50 will not be less than the cross section area of the magnetic wire of winding 22. This is to prevent the occurrence of hot spots or similar phenomenon if the electrode end portion dimensions was smaller than the wire cross sectional dimension. In view of the fact that the metal electrodes 48,50 at the ends of body 30 tend to break up or interfere with the lines of magnetic flux emanating from winding 22, the amount of metalized surface on each end must be minimized as much as possible without sacrificing mechanical strength needed for assembly operations. Reducing the area of metal reduces incremental eddy current losses which, in turn, will tend to increase the Q of the coil. The foregoing is accomplished by the cruciform shape of each electrode 48, 50 on the corresponding ends of body 30. In addition, the amount of open end space, i.e. not covered by the metal electrode, is a variable which can be used to optimize performance of the device. By way of example, in an illustrative device, body 30 has a maximum length of 8.128mm 0.320 inch and ends 32,34 each are square with maximum sides of 3.302mm 0.130 inch . Each of the contact sections on both electrodes 48,50 has a minimum length of 1.905mm 0.075 inch and minimum width of 0.508mm 0.020 inch . The inductor of Figs. 1 and 2 is made in the following manner. First, the discrete electronic device 10, in the form of an inductor, is provided. It is a particular advantage of the method of the present invention that device 10 can be made according to known, conventional and proven manufacturing techniques. Briefly, the core 20 is formed from selected material, magnet wire is wound thereon to provide winding 22 and leads 16, 18 are soldered as at 24 to terminations of winding 22 and extend out from opposite ends of the device. The next step in the method is encapsulating the device body and leads, in this case core 20, winding 22 and leads 16, 18, in electrical insulating material in a manner shaping the material to provide a body having first and second spaced apart ends and a mounting surface extending between the ends and to expose the ends of the leads. The requirements for the material are that it provides adequate electrical insulation and mechanical stability in the resulting surface mountable device. The inductor 14 and leads 16, 18 are placed in a mold generally designated 80 in Fig. 3, the interior of which is shaped to define the desired shape of body 30, in the present illustration elongated rectangular. Mold 80 is provided with openings 82,94 at opposite ends through which end portions of leads 16, 18 extend. The body of inductor 14 comprising core 20 and winding 22 is positioned in mold 20 with the longitudinal axis of the inductor body substantially coincident with the longitudinal axis of mold 80, with the body of inductor substantially equi distant from the four sides of mold 80, and with the ends of the inductor body spaced substantially equal distances to the corresponding ends of mold 80. The electrical insulating material, for example a high grade, thermosetting epoxy material, is introduced to mold 80 filling the interior and encapsulating the core 20, winding 22 in portions of leads 16, 18 contained within mold 80. The epoxy material is allowed to cure or set, with application of heat if necessary. Then, the resulting body is removed from mold 80. The next step in the method is applying the first and second electrode means 48 and 50 on the first and second ends 32, and 34, respectively, of body 30 on adjacent regions of the mounting surface 36. In making the inductor illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the electrode means 48, 50 are preformed from a metal sheet to include the central region 64, end sections 56, 58, 60 and 62 and contact sections 66, 68, 70 and 72. Each electrode means 48, 50 then is placed with the end sections in contact with the corresponding exposed end of the leads and the contact sections are placed on the mounting surface. By way of further illustration, the foregoing can be accomplished by stamping each electrode 48, 50 from copper, placing the electrode against the end of body 30 with the lead protruding through a central hole in the electrode. The lead then is swaged or flattened against the electrode to hold it in place. The exposed copper area of each electrode then would be plated, for example with tin or tin lead alloy. Alternatively, a plurality of electrodes are chemically milled on a metal frame piece, the flat electrode still in the frame is placed against the end of body 30 with a short portion of the corresponding lead extending through a center hole in the milled electrode shape. A suitable tool then cuts electrode off the frame, bends the contact sections over against the mounting surface portions, and swages the lead against the electrode to secure it. The exposed copper sections of the electrode are plated, for example with tin or tin lead alloy. Figs. 4 and 5 show in further detail one of the electrode means, for example electrode 48, preformed from a metal sheet according to the foregoing techniques. Only the one electrode means 48 is shown, it being understood that the other electrode means 50 is identical. An aperture 90 is provided in central region 64. The side edges of each elongated, rectangular end section 56, 58, 60 and 62 are substantially mutually parallel, and adjacent side edges meet at substantially right angles. The end sections 56, 58, 60 and 62 and central region 64 are disposed in the same plane. The elongated, rectangular contact sections 66, 68, 70 and 72 are disposed at substantially right angles to the corresponding end sections 56, 58, 60 and 62 respectively. On each of the contact sections 66, 68, 70 and 72 the side edges are mutually parallel, the end edges are mutually parallel, and adjacent side and end edges meet at substantially right angles. A preferred metal for each electrode means 48, 50 is 1 2 hard beryllium copper. A solder coating can be applied to the entire surface area of each electrode, the coating consisting by weight of 60 tin minimum and 40 lead maximum. Other suitable materials can be used for the electrodes, for example phosphor bronze. By way of example, in an illustrative device, the end portion has a thickness of about 0.127mm 0.005 inch , opening 90 has a diameter of about 0.635mm 0.025 inch , the width of each section 56, 58, 60 and 62 is about 1.016mm 0.040 inch and each contact section 66, 68, 70 and 72 has a length of about 2.032mm 0.080 inch , a width of about 0.508mm 0.020 inch and a thickness of about 0.127mm 0.005 inch . In the foregoing techniques, the electrode means 48, 50 are preformed from a metal sheet and stamping or chemical milling methods are involved. As further alternatives, the electrode means could be provided by metallization application techniques including metallic spray or application of a solderable conductive epoxy. In use, the device 10 as shown in Fig. 1 simply is placed on a flat printed circuit board with one of the mounting surface portions, for example sections 68 and 78 in contact with appropriate sections of the circuit path defined on the board. The device is soldered or otherwise mounted in place at the region of contact between the contact sections 68 and 78 and the board circuit paths. One advantage of the configuration of Fig. 1 is that any of the four mounting surfaces 38, 40, 42 and 44 can be placed against the board thereby avoiding orientation problems in mounting. Furthermore, the relatively large flat surface areas of each mounting surface portion 38, 40, 42 and 44 enhances the mechanical stability of the device when mounted. Another advantage of the configuration of Fig. 1 is that the remaining three mounting surfaces and included contact sections are readily accessible for test purposes while the device is mounted. A further advantage is that during manufacture there is some flexibility in the selected thickness of the electrode contact sections, because if greater thickness is desired by the user of the surface mountable device, that can be accomplished by build up of the solder on the contact sections when the device is mounted. An advantage of a surface mounted electronic device is that it frees up the opposite side of the printed circuit board for containing additional components. In other words, with a surface mounted device, there is no need to extend device leads through openings in the board for mechanical stability as is done conventionally with leaded devices. The present invention provides a surface mounted electronic device with the foregoing advantages and in a manner which advantageously utilizes known, existing and proven techniques of making the actual discrete device, i.e. the inductor, which then is adapted for surface mounting according to the present invention. Fig. 6 shows a surface mountable electronic device 100 according to another embodiment of the present invention. Device 100 is an inductor, and for convenience in illustration and description, components in Fig. 6 which are similar to those of the inductor of Figs. 1 and 2 are identified by the same reference numeral with a prime designation. As in the inductor in Figs. 1 and 2, core 20 is of powdered iron, phenolic or ferrite material and body 30 is of epoxy. Electrodes 48 and 50 are formed in a manner identical to that of electrodes 48 and 50 in the inductors of Figs. 1 and 2. The inductor of Fig. 6 is of the shielded type and to this end includes shield means in the form of sleeve 102 surrounding core 20 and winding 24 for containing the magnetic material and preferably is of the same material as core 20 . The inner and outer diameters of sleeve 102 are such that it is spaced radially outwardly of winding 22 and inwardly of the sections of mounting surface 36 . Generally, sleeve 102 is of the same axial length as core 20 . The wall thickness of sleeve 102 is selected to be thin enough to allow room between winding 22 and the confines of body 30 yet thick enough to withstand encapsulation in the material of body 30. The provision of shield means 102 contain the lines of magnetic force or flux therein provides a condition in device 100 which causes the amount of metallized surface on ends 32 , 34 to be less critical. While device 100 is shown in Fig. 6 with electrodes 48 ,50 identical to electrodes 48,50 of Figs. 1 and 2, the provision of shield 102 enables solid metallized ends to be employed as the electrodes in a manner which will be described. By way of example, in an illustrative device, body 30 has a maximum length of 12.7mm 0.500 inch , each end 32 34 is substantially square with maximum dimensions of 5.00mm 0.197 inch by 5.08mm 0.200 inch , and the electrode contact sections each have a minimum width of 0.635mm 0.025 inch and a minimum length of 3.175mm 0.125 inch . The electrodes 48 ,50 are of 1 2 hard berryllium copper coated with suitable tin lead alloy such as 60 40 solder which meets the solderability requirements of MlL STD 202F, METHOD 208C. Sleeve 102 is powdered iron or ferrite material.
