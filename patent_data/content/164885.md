# Fluid flow sensor.

## Abstract
A fluid flow sensor has a heater resistor HR1 mounted in the fluid stream 13 with two sensor resistors SR1 and SR2 in a bridge circuit 50 mounted upstream and downstream of HR1 . To compensate for changes in ambient temperature, a further temperature sensitive resis tor SR3 is mounted thermally coupled to the resistors in the fluid stream and forming a bridge 21 . Any imbalance in bridge 21 is sensed by amplifier A1 and fed back to change the energization of bridge 21 to rebalance it. A1 also feeds bridge 50 , to change its energization as well. The bridge 50 is further designed so that the sensor resistors SR1 and SR2 are self heating at low but not high fluid flow rates this improves the linearity of output against fluid flow rate.
