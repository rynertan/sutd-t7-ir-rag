# ROTATIONAL SPEED SENSING SYSTEM.

## Abstract
The purpose of the invention is to obtain a rotational speed sensing system with no response delay to changes in rotational speed and decreased ripple in the output. Two position sensing devices 5a, 5b produce alternating signals A, B having the same amplitude, a phase difference of 90 C to each other and a frequency proportional to the rotation speed. Switching signals S A , S A , S B , S B are obtained from the signals A, B in zero cross circuits 711, 712 and differentiated signals dA, dA, dB, dB are obtained from the signals A, B and the output signals, A, B of inverter circuits 72, 73 through differentiating circuits 74, 75, 76, 77 . The amplitudes of the differentiated signals are proportional to the frequencies of the input signals in the respective differentiating circuits. The differentiated signals are selectively switched by the use of the switching signals in a switching circuit 78 and combines into an output signal corresponding to the rotational speed.
