# OPTICAL FIBER SPLICE

## Abstract
An optical fiber splice comprises two coated fibers 50, 51 generally of fused silicon, fusion spliced end to end. The coating 52, 53 is removed from the ends of the fibers for a short distance prior to fusion. After fusion the uncoated ends and a short length of coated fiber, each side of the fusion joint, are encased in a synthetic resin 55 . Conveniently, the resin is molded about the fibers and is cured by radiation, such as UV light, bright visual light and ion bombardment. The resin may contain reinforcernent material 56 .
