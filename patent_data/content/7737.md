# An aqueous solution containing a surfactant and its uses in emulsification.

## Abstract
Surfactants of a defined formula, typically prepared by reacting an alkoxylated hexitol fatty acid ester with a di or tri basic acid to induce a low degree of polymerisation. The surfactants exhibit a higher viscosity in aqueous solution and in admixture with other conventional surfactants than the unpolymerised material.
