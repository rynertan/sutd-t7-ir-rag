## Description
TITLE ORGANIC TITANIUM COMPOSITIONS USEFUL AS CROSS LINKERSSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel aqueous titanium compositions comprising mixtures of at least two titanium compounds, at least one of which effects cross linking of hydroxyl containing materials more rapidly than at least one other titanium compound. It relates also to the use of such organic titanium compositions in a novel process for hydraulically fracturing oil and or gas containing subterranean formations. It relates in addition to aqueous compositions useful in such a process.BACKGROUND dr THE INVENTION Titanium esters react with high molecular weight hydroxyl containing compounds so as to crosslink them and produce gels, J. Oil and Colour Chem.Assoc. 31, 405 1948 . As the cross linking rate of simple alkyl esters of titanium is too fast for some industrial uses, it has been depressed by combining titanium esters with a variety of multifunctional compounds e.g., the complex condensation products prepared by Shacklett, U.S. Patent No. 2,870,181, by reacting an organotitanate with an hydroxy carboxylic acid such as lactic acid the organic titanate chelates obtained by reacting alkyl titanates with 2,4 pentanedione or an acetoacetate, U.S. Patent No. 2,680,108 also those prepared by reacting alkyl titanates with alkanolamines, U.S. Patent Nos.2,950,174 and 3,301,723. The production of oil and gas can be stimulated by a technique, known as hydraulic fracturing, in which a fluid composition is introduced into an oil or gas containing subterranean formation at a flow rate and pressure which create and or extend a fracture into the formation. The fluid composition usually carries a proppant e.g., sand, bauxite, etc. which is forced into the fracture by the fluid composition and prevents closure of the fracture after the fluid pressure is released. For example, Tiner, et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,888,312, disclose effecting hydraulic fracturing of a subterranean formation by using an aqueous gel prepared from a solvatable polysaccharide which had been cross linked with an organotitanate chelate prepared by reacting tetraisopropyl titanate with triethanolamine.The rate at which such aqueous gels are cross linked by such an organotitanate chelate can be retarded further by adding a polyol to the aqueous gel prior to admixing it with such an organotitanate chelate,Hollenbeak et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,464,270. On the other hand, Conway, U.S. Patent No. 4,462,917, retarded the cross linking rate of that same organotitanate chelate by admixing it with a polyol and aging the admixture for 3 to 12 weeks prior to combining the same with the aqueous gel. The fluid composition used in hydraulic fracturing comprises an aqueous fluid usually water or aqueous alcohol , a polymeric gelling agent e.g., a solvatable polysaccharide , and a cross linking agent. The aqueous fluid is used to solvate the gelling agent, and the solvated gelling agent, which is to be cross linked, is typically referred to as the base gel. n The pH of the base gel can be adjusted with various buffering agents prior to cross linking.The rate of cross linking determines the rate of viscosity development in the fluid composition. It is desirable to control the rate of cross linking so that the development of viscosity is delayed until the composition is placed in the subterranean formation. Several factors influence rate of cross linking. It is directly proportional to the concentration of the polymeric gelling agent and the temperature of the base gel, so that an increase in the gelling agent concentration or the gel temperature causes an increase in the rate of cross linking. On the other hand, as the temperature of the subterranean formation is cooled by injection of the fluid composition, the rate of cross linking decreases. The pH of the base gel has its effect on cross linking as well as the pH of the base gel increases from 7.0 to 8.5, the rate of cross linking increases.Because more than one batch of base gel is used in any fracturing job, and because conditions such as base gel temperature and formation temperature vary from job to job and with the time of year, it is desirable to use a cross linking agent or agents which have a variable or adjustable rate of cross linking to compensate for these changes and provide a reproducible viscosity development time after time. Cross linking agents having a high rate of cross linking may give a cross linked gel e.g., from hydroxypropyl guar which exhibits poor retention of viscosity with time, also with increased temperature.Moreover, use of such high rate cross linkers may give gels which develop high viscosity while the gel is being pumped down to the subterranean formation, resulting in shear degradation which reduces or destroys the capacity of the base gel to maintain the proppant e.g., sand in suspension. As a consequence, the proppant may drop out of suspension a screen out and may block the bottom of the well tubing.Excessively high viscosities are not encountered in pumping gels cross linked with low rate cross linkers, and therefore such cross linkers avoid shear degradation. But one may none the less experience screen outs with the use of low rate cross linkers because the gel fails ever to reach a viscosity high enough to keep the proppant in suspension while being pumped down into the formation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel composition and process of this invention overcome the disadvantages associated with those of the prior art. The compositions are such that development of the high viscosity needed for hydraulic fracturing takes place as the aqueous gel reaches the formation to be fractured, thus avoiding excessive shear degradation. The process of this invention enables one to accommodate changes in temperature, pH and polymeric gel concentration as they are encountered in the field. In the compositions of the present invention, one uses at least two aqueous titanates prepared by reacting a tetravalent titanium compound of an inorganic acid with an a hydroxycarboxylic acid, a polyol and water. In such a composition, at least one of the aqueous titanates effects cross linking of hydroxyl containing compounds e.g., a solvatable polysaccharide more rapidly than at least one other aqueous titanate contained in the compositions. The a hydroxy carboxylic acids useful according to the invention may be monocarboxylic acids, such as lactic acid and glycolic acid dicarboxylic acids, such as malic acid or tricarboxylic acids, such as citric acid. Moreover, they can be polyhydroxypolycarboxylic acids such as tartaric acid or saccharic acid, monocarboxylic acids having a plurality of hydroxy groups, such as gluconic acid and gylceric acid, or aromatic hydroxy acids such as mandelic acid. The polyols also vary widely. In general, they are trihydric, tetrahydric, pentahydric or hexahydric alcohols, including glycerol, erythritol, arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol, dulcitol, mannitol, and inositol. Other polyols useful in the invention include monosaccharides, e.g., glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose and xylose, as well as disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, maltose and cellobiose. Sorbitol is the preferred polyol for purposes of the invention. The aqueous titanates useful according to this invention can be prepared by the method disclosed in our co pending European Patent ApplicationNo.86 300785.2, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In the above application, one combines a polyol, water and an hydroxy carboxylic acid, and then reacts that combination of materials with a tetravalent titanium compound of an inorganic acid. In an alternative method, one forms an aqueous solution of an hydroxy carboxylic acid, reacts said aqueous solution with a tetravalent titanium compound of an inorganic acid, and reacts the resulting material with a polyol. In a preferred embodiment of each method, the so formed composition is neutralized with a suitable base.Likewise, in each, the starting materials may be present at mol ratios in the range between about 1 to 3 mols of hydroxy acid per mol of titanium and between about 0.25 to 2 mol of polyol per mol of titanium. Preferably, the water content of the compositions is in the range between 36 and 60 mols of water per mol of titanium. In most cases neutralization of the composition is effected to a pH in the range between 6.5 and 9. In accordance with the hydraulic fracturing process of the present invention, one can establish and maintain a desired cross linking rate by using a mixture of cross linkers which cross link at two different rates, i.e., fast and slow, fast and moderate, or moderate and slow. In the colder winter months, or as injection of the fluid composition cools the formation, or as pH becomes more acidic, more of the faster cross linking component is used. In the summer months or as the temperature of the formation increases or pH is raised or with an increase in the depth at which the formation is located, more of a slower cross linker is used. In this way, the rate of cross linking and viscosity development can be controlled in a reproduciblefashion between the extremes of the components of the mixture. The proportions of the different aqueous titanates in the composition used in the process of this invention can be determined empirically as a function of gel temperature, subterranean formation depth, subterranean formation temperature, pH of the base gel and of the formation, and base gel concentration. As any of those parameters changes, the proportion of the slower or faster cross linker can be changed accordingly. Thus, for example, one would commence a hydraulic fracturing operation with at least two aqueous titanates at a ratio which is suitable for base gel pH and temperature as well as the depth and temperature of the formation. As the fluid composition is pumped into the subterranean formation, the temperature of the formation will decrease. At that point, the proportion of the faster cross linker in the composition of this invention is increased.For example, one can vary the volume volume ratio of a faster cross linker to a slower cross linker in range of about 10 1 to about 1 10, usually about 3 1 to 1 3. In a preferred embodiment, 1 volume of the aqueous reaction product of 1 mol of TiC14 plus l mol of lactic acid plus 1 2 mol of sorbitol is combined with 1 volume of the aqueous reaction product of 1 mol of TiC14 plus 1 mol of malic acid plus 1 mol of sorbitol. The solvatable polysaccharides useful in the process of the invention include guar gum and locust bean gum, as well as other galactomannan and glucommannan gums, such as those derived from sennas, Brazilwood, Tera, Honey locust, Karaya gum and the like.Derivatives of such gums are useful also, e.g., hydroxyethylguar, hydroxypropylguar, carboxyethylhydroxyethylguar, carboxymethylhydroxypropylguar, and the like, as well as cellulose derivatives containing carboxyl groups, such as carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylhydroxyethylcellulose, and the like.Hydroxypropylguar and carboxymethylhydroxypropylguar are preferred polysaccharides for use in the present invention. Hydroxypropylguar is the most preferred gum based upon its commercial availability and desirable properties. On the other hand, carboxymethylhydroxypropylguar is sometimes used in place of hydroxypropylguar in fracturing fluids when the permeability of the formation is such that one wishes to keep the residual solids at a low level, so as to prevent formation damage. The solvatable polysaccharides can be used individually or in combination usually, however, a single material is used. The solvatable polysaccharides are normally blended with a solvent such as water or an aqueous medium e.g., aqueous methanol, ethanol, 1 to 3 HCI or potassium chloride to form an uncross linked gel as a first step. The amounts of solvatable polysaccharide and the cross linker composition therefor vary. One uses small but effective amounts which for both will vary with the circumstances, e.g., the type of geologic formation, the depth at which fluid fracturing is to be performed, temperature, pH, etc. Moreover, the type of cross linker composition that is chosen will vary also with some of the same factors. In addition, the rates of cross linking will be a factor to be considered in choosing the mixture of titanium compounds. The aqueous titanium compounds of lactic and glycolic acids give approximately the same rate of cross linking, with others in the following descending order glycolic and lactic acids malic acid tartaric acid citric acid gluconic acid.In all cases, one uses as small an amount of each in water as will provide the viscosity level necessary to effect fracturing of the subterranean formation to the extent necessary to promote adequate recovery of oil or gas from it. For example, satisfactory gels can generally be made by using the solvatable polysaccharide in amounts up to about 1.5 weight percent and up to about 0.35 weight percent of the cross linker composition, both percentages being based on the weight of the aqueous liquid. Preferably, from about 0.3 to about 0.7 weight percent of the solvatable polysaccharide is used and from about 0.075 to about 0.15 weight percent of the cross linker composition. The following Examples ae given in further illustration of the invention but not by way of limitation. The mixtures rf aqueous titanates are described in the Table in terms of the volume ratio v v of one titanate to another. So as to illustrate their suitability for use in hydraulic fracturing processes, the mixtures of aqueous titanates set forth in the Examples were used in two types of tests. One of the tests measures the viscosity imparted to hydroxypropylguar as a result of having been crosslinked by the mixtures of aqueous titanates, and the other measures the rate at which such mixtures of aqueous titanates effect cross linking of hydroxypropylguar. For a pH 7 base gel, one blends for 30 minutes in a Waring Blender at a pH of 7 a fumaric acid sodium bicarbonate buffer, 4.5 g of hydroxypropylguar and 0.9 g of sodium thiosulfate in 750 ml of 2 by weight KC1. If one wants a pH 8.6 gel, the fumaric acid is omitted. Unless specified otherwise, a pH 8.6 gel is used in the Examples. The method for taking viscosity measurements involves the use of the FANN 50 Viscometer. To the foregoing quantity of base gel in a 1500 ml beaker one adds 0.75 ml of cross linker solution containing 0.00064 mol of titanium. A 25 ml sample of that cross linker containing gel is placed in the cup of the FANN 50 Viscometer with an R l, B 3 configuration at 2500F 1210C and 100 rpm 88 sex 1 shear. The rate of cross linking is determined by measuring the period of time required to achieve maximum viscosity in the FANN 50 Viscometer procedure described above.PREPARATION OF RAW MATERIALS The procedures described below and the compositions thereby prepared are typical of those that were used for preparing the compositions used in the Examples that follow.
