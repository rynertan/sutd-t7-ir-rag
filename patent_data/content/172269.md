# Thermoplastic resin film laminate and production thereof.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic resin film laminate which comprises a thermoplastic resin film, particularly, a polyester film and a layer of a polyester resin composition provided on at least one surface of the film, said composition comprising A a water insoluble polyester copolymer composed of a mixed dicarboxylic acid component containing a dicar boxylic acid having metal sulfonate group in an amount of 0.5 to 15 mol based on all the dicarboxylic acid component and a glycol component and B inert particles the weight ratio of A B 100,000 0.5 3,000. Optionally, the composition can contain one or more ingredients selected from the group consisting of a water soluble silicone, a polyfunctional reactive compound, a polyethylene glycol and its derivative and an antistatic agent. The thermoplastic resin film laminate is preferably produced by so called in line coating.
