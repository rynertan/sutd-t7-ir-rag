# Optical disk scanning system.

## Abstract
An optical disk system having direct read after write capa bilities in which the write beam and the read beam are gener ated by a pair of integrated injection diode lasers. The integra tion can be achieved by mounting two separate injection diode lasers side by side in a common package or providing two side by side injection diode lasers formed on a common semicon ductor substrate. The two lasers would be located in the same focal plane relative to a recording material, with one of the lasers pulse modulated to provide a data modulated write beam and the other laser driven in the continuous wave CW regime to provide a read beam of constant intensity. The plane con taining the focused beams would be oriented relative to the re cording material so that the focused beams impinge upon adja cent portions on one data track of the recording material. Since the pair of lasers are closely spaced 1 1000 microns a com mon optical path or train is used for both the write beam and the read beam.
