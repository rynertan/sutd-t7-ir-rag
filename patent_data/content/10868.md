## Description
PRODUCTION OF AROMATIC POLYETHERS The present invention relates to the production of aromatic polyethers and in particular to the production of aromatic polyethers containing sulphone and or ketone linkages termed hereinafter aromatic polyethersulphones and polyetherketones according to whether the sulphone or ketone linkages preponderate . It has been proposed in Canadian patent 847 963 to make such polymers by reacting a bisphenol and a dihalobenzenoid compound, or a halophenol, in which dihalobenzenoid compound or halophenol the halogen atoms are activated by SO2 or CO groups ortho or para thereto, with an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate in the presence of the liquid phase of a sulphoxide or sulphone reaction solvent. In United Kingdom patent specification 1 264 900 a similar process is described employing a polar reaction solvent and using potassium carbonate as the alkali metal carbonate. Also in Japanese patent publication 53 12991 there is described a process for making such polymers by reacting the bisphenol, dihalobenzenoid compound and alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate in the absence of a solvent. While such processes are very effective for the production of aromatic polyethers, the reaction product at the end of the polycondensation reaction is very sticky and viscous, and on removal from the reaction vessel leaves an adherent residue which must be removed before the vessel can be re used. Also such a reaction product normally requires a comprehensive and expensive work up procedure to isolate the aromatic polyether in an acceptable state, e.g. involving milling the product and several washings with water and or the use of expensive solvents. A process has now been discovered which can yield a reaction product which may be discharged cleanly from the reaction vessel and from which the polyarylene ether can be isolated exceptionally easily in comparison to the above described processes. According to the present invention there is provided a process for the production of an aromatic polyether containing SO2 and or CO linkages comprising heating i a substantially equimolar mixture of a at least one bisphenol and b at least one dihalobenzenoid compound, or ii at least one halophenol, in which dihalobenzenoid compound or halophenol the halogen atoms are activated by SO2 or CO groups ortho or para thereto, with at least one alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate to effect a polycondensation reaction to form the aromatic polyether the amount of carbonate or bicarbonate being such that there is at least one alkali metal atom for each phenol group present, wherein the polycondensation reaction is carried out in the absence of a solvent and in the presence of sufficient of an infusible under the conditions of reaction particulate support substance for the polyether so as to yield a reaction medium in the form of a free flowing powder by the end of the polycondensation reaction. An advantageous characteristic of the process of the invention is that the reaction vessel normally discharges cleanly this applies even to glass reaction flasks and may often be used repeatedly without interbatch cleaning.The process does not involve the use of a solvent and isolation of the polyaromatic ether may be effected exceptionally rapidly and easily and therefore cheaply , e.g. by a short and simple sequence of water washes in which the isolated polymer is obtained in the form of a readily filterable powder and requires no milling or classification. Such a polymer powder after washing could be very suitable as it stands for subsequent compounding or fabrication processes. The infusible support substance for the polyaromatic ether is normally inorganic and for ease of work up is desirably water soluble although in some cases it may be useful to retain the support with the worked up polymer in order to produce a highly filled polyaromatic ether in such cases the support could be e.g. inorganic or an organic polymer. In many cases, the support substance may simply consist of a large excess over stoichiometric of the alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate. If this should be undesirable, the support substance may be an inert material such as an inert inorganic salt, e.g. an alkali metal halide such as sodium chloride. The process of the invention may be operated as a batch process or as a continuous process. The halophenol or bisphenol dihalobenzenoid compound added initially to the reaction mixture is are preferably in powder form. In the case of using bisphenol dihalobenzenoid compound as reactants, it may be advantageous under some circumstances to premix these compounds before addition, e.g. by powder mixing or by melting together followed by comminution into powder. When operating the process of the invention, it is usual not to include a liquid diluent with the initially charged materials. Under such conditions, the halophenol or bisphenol dihalobenzenoid compound reactant s should be in powder form and the reaction medium is initially a free flowing powder and little or no change in appearance or behaviour occurs during the polycondensation. In such a system, the viscosity of the reaction medium is initially low and does not alter significantly during the polycondensation consequently a conventional type of reaction vessel is not essential and a variety of mixers or blenders could be used as the reaction vessel provided they are capable of operation with an inert atmosphere at a temperature sufficiently high for the polycondensation reaction.Thus under such circumstances, a polymerisation plant could consist simply of a heated mixer, a wash vessel and a dryer. Any type of suitable mixing vessel could be employed for example it could be a vessel provided with a stirrer or a vessel in which the medium is agitated by the passage therethrough of a gas e.g. an inert gas such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium or argon, or possibly air as in a fluid bed reactor the gas e.g. could be heated to provide at least part of the heat required for the polymerisation and or recirculated to take account of any loss of reactant s by volatilisation the gas velocity could e.g.be kept low, again to minimise loss of reactant s by volatilisation . Such a gas agitated reactor could provide good temperature control coupled with efficient mixing. A mixing vessel employing both a stirrer and gasagitation could also be used. Optionally, however, the initially charged materials may include an inert liquid diluent such as a hydrocarbon like chlorobenzene. Under such conditions, the reaction medium during the polycondensation is a suspension or paste. The diluent must however have been distilled out of the reaction medium by the end of the polycondensation reaction so as to leave a free flowing powder like that where no diluent is employed. Another variant of the process is to include an insoluble material s with the initial charge which can remain with the isolated polyaromatic ether as a filler. During the polycondensation, the aromatic polyether forms as a coating on the support material and hence the diameter of the resulting polymer particles is related to the particle size of the support. The particles at the end of polymerisation filter exceptionally easily and on washing with a suitable liquid e.g. water where the support is water soluble come to resemble envelopes having extremely thin wall sections this results in very fast leaching to remove the support if this is desired and other by products . My experience at the present time is that as few as two water washes when using a watersoluble support can yield polymer essentially free of residues. Preferred bisphenols include hydroquinone and those of formulaEMI5.1 in which Y is a direct link, oxygen, sulphur, SO2 , CO , or a divalent hydrocarbon radical. Particularly preferred bisphenols include hydroquinone 4,4 dihydroxybenzophenone 4,4 dihydroxydiphenylsulphone 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 4,4 dihydroxybiphenyl 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulphide. The dihalobenzenoid compounds preferably have the formulaEMI5.2 in which X and X , which may be the same or different, are halogen atoms and are ortho or para to the groups Q andQ Q and Q , which may be the same or different, are COor SO2 Ar is a divalent aromatic radical and n is 0, 1, 2 or 3. The aromatic radical Ar is preferably a divalent aromatic radical selected from phenylene, biphenylylene or terphenylylene. Particularly preferred dihalides have the formulaEMI6.1 where m is 1, 2 or 3. Examples of suitable dihalides include 4,4 dichlorodiphenylsulphone 4,4 difluorodiphenylsulphone 4,4 difluorobenzophenone 4,4 dichlorobenzophenone 4 chloro 4 fluorodiphenylsulphone 4 chloro 4 fluorobenzophenone bis 4,4 4 chlorophenylsulphone biphenyl. Mixtures of dihalides may be employed so as to produce copolymers. Examples of mixtures that may be employed include 4,4 dichlorodiphenylsulphone with 4,4 dichlorobenzophenone or bis 4 4 chlorophenylsulphonyl b iphenyl. Preferred halophenols are those of formulaEMI6.2 wherein X is halogen and is ortho or para to Q, Q is SO2 or CO , and Ar is an aromatic radical, and OH is preferably para to the group 0. The aromatic radical Ar is preferably a divalent aromatic radical selected from phenylene, biphenylylene, and radicals of the formulaEMI6.3 where Q is CO or SO2 and n and m, which may be the same or different are integers selected from 1, 2 and 3. Particularly preferred halophenols have the formulaEMI7.1 where p is 0 or 1. Examples of suitable halophenols include 4 4 chlorophenylsulphonyl phenol 4 4 fluorophenylsulphonyl phenol 4 4 chlorobenzoyl phenol 4 hydroxy 4 4 chlorophenylsulphonyl biphenyl 4 4 hydroxyphenyl sulphonyl 4 4 chlorophenyl sulphonyl biphenyl. Mixtures of halophenols may be employed so as to produce copolymers. Examples of mixtures that may be employed include 4 4 chlorophenylsulphonyl phenol with 4 4 chlorobenzoyl phenol, 4 hydroxy 4 4 chlorophenyl sulphonyl biphenyl, or 4 4 hydroxyphenylsulphonyl 4 4 chlorophenylsulphonyl biphenyl. Equally mixtures of one or more halophenols with a substantially equimolar mixture of a dihalide and bisphenol may be employed. As an example there may be mentioned 4 4 chlorobenzoyl phenol in admixture with 4,4 dichlorodiphenylsulphone and 4,4 dihydroxydiphenylsulphone. The polycondensation is conducted using the at least one alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate as defined. The at least one alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate is preferably selected from sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, rubidium carbonate and caesium carbonate. The at least one alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate may be a single carbonate or bicarbonate. Mixtures of alkali metal carbonates and or bicarbonates may also be employed. In particular it may be advantageous to use a major amount of a carbonate or bicarbonate of one alkali metal e.g.sodium in admixture with a minor amount of a carbonate or bicarbonate of an alkali metal of higher atomic number e.g. potassium . The polycondensation reaction is normally carried out at temperatures within the range 150 to 4000C, the maximum temperature during polymerisation depending on the polymer being made and its desired properties e.g. molecular weight. In most cases, the maximum temperature during polycondensation is within the temperature range 270 to 3700C inclusive . Where a bisphenol and dihalobenzenoid compound are employed, they should be used in substantially equimolar amounts. An excess of one over the other often leads to the production of low molecular weight products although this may be desirable in some cases . However a slight excess, up to 5 mol , of dihalide may usually be employed if desired without incurring low molecular weight products. The polymerisation reaction may be terminated if desired by mixing a suitable end stopping reagent, e.g. a mono or polyfunctional halide such as methyl chloride, t butyl chloride or 4,4 dichlorodiphenylsulphone with the reaction mixture at the polymerisation temperature. Polymers prepared by the process of the present invention are particularly suitable for use in applications where the polymer is liable to be subject to high service temperatures. Examples of such applications include electrical insulation, e.g. wire coatings, electrical connector mouldings, and cookware coatings. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples.
