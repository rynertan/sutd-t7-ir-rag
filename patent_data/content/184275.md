# Gas or low volume liquid flow meter.

## Abstract
An apparatus permitting non invasive electrical monitor ing of the volume of flow of a fluid at relatively low pressures and flow rates. The apparatus comprises an analog flow gage 12 having a housing with an inner flow chamber 19 of upwardly increasing cross sectional area and a ball indicator 20 received in the chamber 19 . The flow chamber 19 is in the shape of a cylinder with a plurality of longitudinal slits extending outwardly from the cylinder and equally radially spaced apart. Each of the slits has a wedge shaped tapered portion which accounts for the increasing cross sectional area of the chamber 19 . The flow rate inside the chamber 19 is directly linearly related to the amount of upward displacement of the ball indicator 20 along the length of the tapered portions. The apparatus also includes associated electrical circuitry 14 for providing infinite step position detection of the ball indicator 20 , converting the analog position information into a digital output and display ing a digital readout of the accumulative volume of flow, scaled in cubic feet.
