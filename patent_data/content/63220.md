# Device for measuring the unbalance of an object.

## Abstract
A device for measuring the unbalance of a disc like object comprises at least three load sensors 23 having cantilevers 23a fo supporting the object 27 at their corresponding measuring points 24 selected, with a same angular distance therebetween, on a measuring circle 25 which is concentric with a circular through hole 26 of the object 27 , so as to measure the weight of the object 27 , each of cantilever 23a being extended tangential to the measuring circle 25 and directed perpendicular to the line of sight in same sense when viewed from the center of through hole a positioning means 31 for positioning the center of through hole 26 in the object 27 relative to load sensor 23 and a calculator means 36 for calculating the unbalance of the object 27 using the data supplied from plural load sensors 23 .
