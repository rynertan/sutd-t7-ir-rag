# Method of providing a reinforced shaped ceramic body.

## Abstract
A shaped ceramic body having improved mechanical strength which is useful as a structural material, such as for en gine parts, is produced by coating the shaped body with a slip which after firing has substantially the same chemical compo sition as the ceramic shaped body and differs very little in ther mal expansion coefficient at 800 C from the shaped body, dry ing the coated shaped body, subjecting the coated shaped body to hydrostatic pressing and firing it.
