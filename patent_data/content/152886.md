# IMMOBILIZED NUCLEIC ACID CONTAINING PROBES

## Abstract
An immobilized nucleic acid containing probe suitable for accurate hybridization gene analyses is produced by en zymatically coupling a nucleotide to a predetermined end of the nucleic acid and then selectively coupling a suitably prepared solid support, such as cellulose, through the nu cleotide. Thus the ribose of the nucleotide can be oxidized by sodium periodate to form aldehyde groups which will react with a primary amino group introduced into collulose, forming a Schiff s base. For grater stability of the immobiliz ing bond the Schiff s base is reduced to a saturated second ary amino group by reduction with borohydride. Alternative ly, the nucleotide may carry an SH or Hg moiety which will selectively react with complementary moieties on the solid support.
