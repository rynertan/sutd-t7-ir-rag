## Description
Method of manufacturing an endless conveyor belt of flexible material, conveyor belt and device comprising a frame and a conveyor belt arranged in said frame. The invention relates to a method of manufacturing an endless conveyor belt of flexible material, along at least one side edge of which an upwardly extending heel is fastened. Such conveyor belts, which are frequently provided along both longitudinal or side edges with upwardly extending heels, are employed, for example, in vacuum belt filters or the like, where the upwardly extending heels are provided for preventing material to be displaced with the aid of the conveyor belt from sliding sideways off the conveyor belt. It is common practice to arrange the heels on the side edges of the belts, for example, by vulcanizing or gluing, the belt and the heels being disposed on each other in a flat plane without being loaded. When during operation a belt manufactured in this way moves along a reversing roller or the like and is bent thereby, that part of the belt that is located above the so called neutral line usually located at the area of reinforcing layers for the material of the belt and located in the upper part of the heel above the neutral line of said heel will be elongated. This elongation may after some time give rise to cracks in the material of the belt and or the heel as well as to diszngagement of the glue connectionbetween the belt and the heel. The elongation amounts toEMI2.1 wherein x height of the material above the neutral line,R radius of curvature of the neutral line. Consequently the risk of damage of the kind set forth occurs in particular two places i.e. 1. the upper face of the.belt commonly made from comparatively hard rubber, in which. in practice an elongation of 5 to 10 may give rise to cracks, 2. the top side of the heel usually made from comparatively soft rubber, where an elongation of 20 to 25 may result in the formation of cracks. One mssibility of preventing such a formation of cracks resides in the choice of the latest possible diameters of the drums, along which the belt is passed. However, this involves a bulky and expensive construc tion of the device comprising the flexible conveyor belt. According to a first aspect of the invention the heel is fastened to the belt in a manner such that in the flat Dosition of the belt comPression stress prevails on th. side of the heel remote from the belt. When such a belt is used and passed along a curved surface, for example, moved along a reversing drum or the like , the pressure in the upper part of the heel will diminish and change eventually into a tensile stress,it being thus possible to ensure that the overall elongation of the heel is more favourable than in the conveyor belts of conventional manufacture hitherto used. A further aspect of the invention relates to a conveyor belt made from flexible material having grooves extending transversly of the direction of lenght of the belt and provided in an upper layer of the belt, the thickness of which is at least substantially equal to the depth of said grooves. Such conveyor belts are, for example, employed in vacuum belt filters, in which a filter cloth is disposed on the belt, the grooves serving to conduct, during operation, filtrate passing the filter cloth towards the centre of the belt, where the filtrate can be evacuated through perforations made in the. belt, Usually the grooves only cover part of the width of the upper layer of the belt, so that the rim parts of the belt on both sides of the grooves in the belt have a proportionally large thickness,as a result of which during the movement of the belt along a curved surface, for example, a reversing drum a comparatively large elongation occurs in the edges of the belt, as explained above. According to the invention the width of the upper layer corresponds with the width of the belt covered by the grooves. In thiS way the presence of proportionally thick belt portions along the belt edges can be avoided. When in this case the peripheral edges of the belt, whose upper faces are located at the level of the bottom sides of the grooves, are provided with upwardly extending heels, the latter can moreover, be fastened and constructed in an advantageous manner.It is then furthermore possible in a simple manner to provide a comparatively broad foot of the heel, which enhances the effect obtained by fastening the heel to the belt in a manner such that in the flat part of the belt a pressure stress prevails on the side of the heel remote from the belt.Moreover, the joint between the heel and the belt will thus be loaded to a lesser extent. According to a further feature of the invention the lenght of life of the conveyor belt can be enhanced in a device comprising a frame and a conveyor belt arranged in said frame, whereby at least the upper part of the conveyor belt is supported by beams,since the beams extend during operation at an acute angle to the direction of displacement of the belt.By using such a construction the belt can be supported throughout its width,whilst in addition X is factory lubrication of the belt travelling along the beams can be ensured in a simple manner. The invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying figures. Fig. 1 is a schematic cross sectional view of a conveyor belt in accordance with the invention. Fig. 2 schematically illlustrates the manner in which a conveyor belt is bent when guided along a reversing drum. Fig. 3 is an enlarged sectional view of part of an embodiment of a conveyor belt in accordance with the invention. Fig. 4 is a sectional view of a ridged strip suitable for use on a convevor belt in accordance with the invention. Fig. 5 schematically illustrates the manner in which a conveyor belt can be supported. The conveyor belt schematically shown by way of example in Fig. 1 comprises an at least substantially flat belt F of elastic material, for example, rubber, the side rims of which are provided with heels 2 and 3, for example, by gluing or vulcanizing these heels 2 and 3 to the belt 1. As stated above, such a belt may be employed in a filter arrange ment, in which commonly a filter tissue 4 is disposed on the upper face of the belt 1 in contact wiht the sides of the heels 2 and 3 facing one another as is indicated by broken. lines in Fig. 1. Such a filter device is used for separating liquids from a mixture of solid substances and fluids, which mixture may be displaced with the aid of the conveyor belt along vacuum boxes or the like. For evacuating the liquids the belt 1 has outlet orifices 5 and in order to enhance the flow of the liquids the upper face of the belt 1 may have draining grooves not shown in Fig. 1. In a filter device or the like such a conveyor belt is commonly passed along a plurality of drums 6 Fig. 2 . From Fig. 2 it will be apparent that during such a movement of the belt along a drum in particular the top side of the heel is elongated. The elongation occuring in the top side of the heel can be calculated when the position of the so called neutral line is known. It may be assumed that this neutral line is located substan tially at the centre of the conventional reinforcing layers provided in the belt 1 having a thickness d. The overall elongation occuring in the upper boundary surface t of a heel during the movement of the conveyor belt along a drum can be re presented by the formula f E E t r P ex in which the elongation due to bias stress in the belt with the heels , g the elongation in the belt when it is deposited in a flat e position without stress, g the elongation produced in the belt due to a curve of the ex belt. Herein 6 in the belt is usually the highest and this ex can ex ex be calculated by the following formula tex 1 ex 3 2 1, wherein R3 the radius of curvature of the bent part of the topside of the heel, R2 the radius of curvature of the neutral line 7 of the bent part of the conveyor belt Fig. 2 Furthermore, on approximation R3 R2 1 2d h, wherein d the thickness of the belt and h the height of the heel Fig. 2 From the foregoing formulae it will be obvious that in order to keep èX within permissible limits either the height h of the heel has tov ex be limited or the radius of curvature of the belt and hence the diameter 2R of the drum,around which the belt is passed has to be large.As stated above the reduction of the heel height results in that the height of the layer of material to be transported by the belt decreases, which in many cases will not be acceptable.An enlargement of the diameters of the reversing drums around which the endless belt has to be passed will involve an enlargement of the device employing the belt and hence higher costs of the device. According to the invention the overall elongation at the top side of the heel is kept within acceptable limits by shaping the heel in a manner such that, when the belt is deposited in a flat position without stress, the top side of the heel has a pressure stress amounting to at least an impor tant portion of the usually occuring C . According to the invention this may ex be achieved by curving the heel during manufacture to a given extent, for example, by using a curved mould for the manufacture of the heel. As an alternative the heel may be composed of a plurality of in themselves uncurved layers in a manner such that the top layer s has have a pressure stress when the heel is deposited in a flat position. It will be obvious that when a heel thus manufactured is fixed to a flat rubber belt, a pressure stress will be generated in the top side of the heel.When afterwards a belt of this structure is curved in the manner shown in Fig.2, the pressure stress in the top part of the belt will decrease and, eventually , change over to a tensile stress in dependence upon the degree of curvature. If, for example, a belt having a thickness of 40 mms and a heel height of 100 mms is employed and if it is assumed that the neutral line 7 will be located in the medium plane of the 40 mms belt, will be as a result of the curve of the belt along a drum of diameter of, for example, 1400 mms EMI6.1 In such a case è may be assumed to be equal to 0 and iff 1 to 2 , it will be equal to 18 to 19 . If it assumed that the heel has a rectangular shape, it is likely for the neutral line to lie midway the height h, when the unfixed heel is curved. When during manufacture the heel is bent with a radius of curvature r 700 mms, the top side of the heel when fixed to a flat belt by gluing or vulcanizing will exhibit a negative stress amounting to EMI6.2 If in such a case a drum having a diameter of 10CO mms rather than a drum of 1400 mms diameter is chosen EMI6.3 can also in this case be maintained at 1 to 2 so that finally çt 24 7 1 to 2 18 to 19 . From the foregoing calculations it will be apparent that when using a belt manufactured by the method in accordance with the invention, it can be bent with an appreciably smaller radius of curvature than in the case of a conventional belt, whereas in both cases the same elongation occurs at the outer side of the heels on the belt.The aforesaid draining grooves provided in conveyor belts used in filter arrangements and having heels or being completely flat employed in such devices in conjunction with side partitions fastened to the frame usually cover only part of the belt width so that the belt edges on both sides of the grooves have a thickness equal to the sum of the thickness of the layer of material lying beneath the grooves and the thickness of the layer of material in which the grooves are made. From the foregoing it will be obvious that due to the elongation occurring in said edges the risk of cracks is high. This disadvantage can be mitigated by using the construction of Fig. 3. From this Figure it will be apparent that the peripheral parts 9 of a belt 8 are thinner than the central part of the belt 8 having grooves 10 extending transversely of the longitudinal direction and covering the whole width of the thicker belt part located between the thin edges 9. The structure is preferable such that the bottoms of the grooves are located at least substantially in the same plane as the top faces of the edges 9. In the em embodiment shown the thinner edge 9 of the belt 8 is provided in the manner described with a heel 11 by gluing or vulcanizing.The Figure shows that the heel 11 is preferably made with a broad foot 12 so that the neutral line of said heel is lowered, which favourable affects the stresses occuring in the heel during operation so that the effect of the bias curvature of the heel is, so to say, additio nally enhanced, whilst in addition a large surface is obtained for fixing the heel to the belt. If a conventional belt of e.g. a thickness of 40 mms and a groove depth of 25 mms,wherein the thickness of the belt edges at the side of the grooves is equal to the sum of the thickness of the layer located beneath the grooves and that of the material having the grooves is passed around a drum having a radius of 500 mms,the elongation in the upper face of the side edges of the belt at the side of the grooves will be 40 500 0.08 or 8 , which is usually too high for a belt of hard, wear resistant rubber. In a belt corresponding to the embodiment of Fizzy the elongation will only be 40 25 500 0.03 or 3 , hence an important improvement. If the elongation should be limited to 5 NO a drum having a radius of 800 mms were required in the first case,whereas with a belt of the kind des cribed with reference to Fig. 3 a drum having a radius of 300 mms will be sufficient. A further advantage herein is that at the side edges of the belt only minor shrinkage effects can occur in the top face so that the edges of the belt will have less tendency to rise. Moreover, the shear forces occuring between the belt and the heel will be lower in this case than in the prior art constructions of the conveyor belts, since the interface is located very near the neutral line of the belt so that at the same time tbe risk of loosening of the heel is reduced. It should be noted that in the foregoing explanation of the invention it is assumed that the belt is deposited in a flat position for gluing or vulcanizing the heel to the belt. However, it will be obvious that a similar effect can be obtained when the belts deposited on a curved surface prior to the fixation of the heel, in which case a heel may be used, which is previously curved as the case may be, during its manufacture. Thus the same effect is obtained, be it, of course, with a slightly different stress distribution, AlthouglF in the embodiment shown inFig. 3 the grooves may be made in a conventional manner in the bulk material of the conveyor belt,it is a disadvantage that the belt has to be made with a thinner rim 9.For the manufacture of the belt this is a difficult construction, particularly with respect to maintenance of the required tolerances. In order to obviate this disadvantage it is efficient to use ridged strips of the kind shown in Fig. 4. From this Figure it will be apparent that a strip is made form a thin substrate 13 and a plurality of relatively parallel ridges 14 being integral with said substrate and bounding grooves between them. At a side edge of the substrate a recess 16 extends in the direction of lenght of the substrate, wheras the other edge of the substrate is provided with a protruding nose 17, which is shaped so that it fits in the recess 16. Such a strip can be effectively made to any desired lenght by extrusion and be subsequently shortened in accordance with the width of the conveyor belt to be manufactured. Such strips cut to lenght can be fixed by gluing or vulcanizing to the conveyor belt so that the grooves extend transversely of the direction of lenght of the conveyor belt. The neighbouring strips can, for example, be joined to one another by fitting the protruding nose 17 in the recess 16 concerned, which is illustrated in Fig.4. The use of such seperate strips applied to the base layer of the conveyor belt has several advantages. In the first place it is not necessary to make grooves in the bulk material of a belt, which involves considerable saving of material, since the volume of the grooves to be provided may amount to 50 to 70 of the total volume of the top layer of the belt. Moreover the belt will have less tendency to warp due to shrinkage of the rubber. If hot or aggressive chemicals have to be displaced with the aid of this conveyor belt, the ridged strips may be made from a chemically resistant kind of rubber without the need for making the entire conveyor belt from this usually expensive material. The incision of grooves in the belt material, which is a labourintensive operation and requires special tools, can also be dispensed with.Instead, it is only necessary to apply the grooved strips, which can be carried out in a considerably simpler manner. If during operation the top face of a belt is damaged or corroded, it can be simply repaired by applying new strips. The surface of the extruded strips is likely to have a smoothness superior to that of a belt in which the grooves are mechanically cut so that fouling by growth is inhibited. Althou in the foregoing the embodiment described comprises a plurality of ridged strips, it is possible, as an alternative, to construct separate ridges and to apply them individually to the base surface of the conveyor belt. However, the former method will usually be preferred, since it is cheaper andcan be carried out more rapidly. A further contribution to the prolongation of the lifetime of the conveyor belt can be achieved by effectively supporting the conveyor belt. Usually the upper run of a conveyor belt in devices of the kind set forth in the foregoing i supported by a plurality of beams extending in the direction of lenght of the belt, whilst water is sprayed onto the bottom surface of the upper run of the belt to serve as a lubricant between the beams supporting the upper run and this upper run. However, during the travel of the belt along such a comparatively narrow beam the water will be laterally displaced already of a shift of the belt by some few metres so that the belt then moves in a dry state along the beam unless throughout the lengt of the beam a large number of members are provided for wetting the contacting surfaces of the beam and the belt. As is illustrated in Fig. 5, this disadvantage of the conventional construction can be obviated by arranging the beams 19 supporting a belt IS at an acute angle owt to the direction of lenght of the belt moving in the direction indicated by the arrow A during operation. The belt surface contacting the beams can be simply wetted just before the belt comes into contact with a beam, after which the belt portion thus wetted will slide along a beam only over a limited distance before getting free of the beam on the other side thereof. The distance over which a given point of the belt will be in contact with a given beam is basin i, wherein ot the ankle between the longitudinal axis of the beam and the direction of lenzht of the belt and b the width of the top side of the beam or, as the case may be, of the coating of the beam. By a suitable choice of the angels not only a most effective lubrication of the belt can be ensured during its movement along the beam but the belt will, in addition, be supported in a comparatively broad part which will also contribute to a reduction of wear and hedge to a longer life time of the belt.
