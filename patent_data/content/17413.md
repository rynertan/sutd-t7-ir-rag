# Fuel injection system and timing advance device therefor.

## Abstract
A hydraulic advance device for selectively transmitting applied forces to a fuel injector of an internal combustion engine. The device is operative to select a normal or advanced timing of the fuel injection. An outer cylindrical body 66 is mounted in the upper end of a fuel injector adapter. An inner body 108 is slidably received in the outer body 66 and a reaction member 103 and pressure responsive plunger 117 are slidably received in a bore 110 formed in the inner body 108 . The plunger 117 and an end wall 128 of the bore 110 cooperate to define a fluid chamber 129 . A one way valve 132 in the chamber 129 permits fluid above a predetermined pressure applied during the advanced stage of the fuel injection cycle to enter the chamber 129 which prevents movement of the plunger 117 , relative to the inner body member 108 . At pressures below a predetermined value and during the normal phase of the fuel injection cycle. the plunger 117 and the reaction member 103 first move relative to the inner body 108 a predetermined amount during which time no movement is transferred to the inner body thus delaying fuel injection relative to advanced phase fuel injection.
