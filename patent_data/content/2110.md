# Fabrication of capacitive transducers by depositing a uniform glass insulating ring.

## Abstract
A method for constructing a capacitive transducer 20 by depositing a uniform glass insulating ring is disclosed herein. The Capacitive transducer consists of a circular base substrate 10 and a circular diaphragm 21 , each supporting one of two capacitor electrodes 22, 16 and separated by a uniform glass insulating ring 14 which determines a uniform air gap 23 between the capacitor electrodes 22, 16 . Pressure changes cause the diaphragm 21 to flex and thereby produce capacitance changes in relation to the pressure being sensed. The thickness of the glass insulating ring 14 is critical to the production of an accurate pressure transducer 20 and is produced in the following manner. A first glass insulating ring layer 14 is screen printed onto a substrate through a mask having a pattern therein. Subsequently, the relative rotational orientation between the mask pattern and the first screened layer 14 is altered by a predetermined number of degrees and a second screened layer is deposited on top of the first layer 14 . By this technique, a uniformly thick layer of glass frit finely divided particles is deposited on the substrate 10 despite any imperfections or variations in the thickness of the mask or the uniformity of the pattern contained in the mask.
