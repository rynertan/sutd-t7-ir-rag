# Analog to digital encoder and digital to analog decoder.

## Abstract
In the encoder an audio input signal is firstly given an adap tive pre emphasis characteristic by a pre processing circuit 16 and is then converted to a digital signal for transmission by a delta modulator 22 . In order to minimise the digital bit rate the delta modulator 22 is rendered adaptive by deriving a step size control signal in a circuit 18 responsive to the slope of the input signal, and applying the control signal to vary the step size of the delta modulator 22 . The bandwidth of the control signal is limited to say 50 Hz by the step size circuit 18 itself or a subsequent low pass filter 24 in order to render the encoder insensitive to random step size errors. The slow re sponse of the control signal is compensated for by a delay cir cuit 20 preceding the delta modulator 22 . The correspond ing decoder comprises an adaptive delta modulator and a cir cuit complementary to the pre processing circuit 16 . In order to keep the decoder as simple as possible it has no step size de rivation circuit. Instead, the step size control signal is trans mitted in conjunction with the main digital signal by way of an analog to digital converter 26 . In the encoder a complemen tary digital to analog converter is followed by another band width limiting filter to reduce the effect of transmission bit errors. The slow response of the decoder control signal is com pensated for by transmitting the step size information from the encoder with a time advance relative to the main digital signal.
