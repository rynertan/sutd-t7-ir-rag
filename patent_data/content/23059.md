# Tilt compensating hanger for toilet tank dispensing apparatus.

## Abstract
A hanger for supporting a toilet tank chemical dispensing apparatus which attaches to the top edge of the tank and which incorporates a tilt compensating feature to accomodate non vertical toilet tank walls. The dispenser 50 is preferably so mounted on the inner leg 30 of a generally U shaped hanger 1 which contacts the innermost surface of the toilet tank wall 60 as to be vertically adjustable. The outer leg 20 of the hanger 1 contacts the outermost surface of the toilet tank wall 60 at a pivot point. Resilient means 40 , which direct a force between the inner leg 30 and the inside surface of the toilet tank wall 60 at a point above the pivot point, coact with the pivot point to produce a coupled force system. The coupled force system causes the hanger 1 and dispenser 50 adjustably secured thereto to rotate about the pivot point into a position in which the lowermost end of the dispenser 50 is held adjacent the tank wall 60 , thereby maintaining the dispenser 50 as close to vertical as is feasible despite the tilt inherent in the toilet tank wall 60 .
