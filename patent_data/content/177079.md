# Method of manufacturing an x ray tube rotary anode and an x ray tube rotary anode manufactured according to this method.

## Abstract
The method provides an X ray tube rotary anode by increasing the thickness of a thin, highly deformed anode disc 1,2 to the desired value by deposition of a layer 7 , consisting mainly of molybdenum, by means of thermal spraying. The method provides an X ray rotary anode which has the attractive properties of a highly deformed anode disc and which also has a large diameter which cannot be obtained by means of the high speed deformation impact process due to the maximum applicable thickness diameter ratio.
