# Baler for forming cylindrical bales.

## Abstract
A roll forming crop baling machine 10 which forms the bale 42 by the use of rigid rollers 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58 and which nevertheless produces bales with a more even bale density. One set of stationary rollers 24, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56 and 58 and another set of shifting rollers 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 are used to form and compress the bale during a major portion of its growth. Each shifting roller gradually moves outward from an initial position near the core 40 of the forming bale which is radially inward from the stationary rollers, to a final position forming a continuous outer boundary with the stationary rollers.
