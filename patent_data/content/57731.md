## Description
VALPROATE CONJUGATION USING DICARBONYLS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention Vaiproate Valproate sodium di n propylacetate is recog nized as an important antiepileptic drug. Its use as an anticonvulsant is beneficial due to its low.toxicity. A minimum level of 50pg ml in serum is required for therapeutic efficacy however, this level is often difficult to maintain due to individual differences in serum absorption and metabolism. It is therefore essential to monitor the serum levels regularly in order to insure that a minimum therapeutic level of valproate is being maintained. of the current assay procedures for valproate, vapor phase chromatography analysis is the most widely used. Known techniques have various inadequacies in being uneconomical, slow and or requiring trained clinicians to perform the assay properly. It is therefore desirable to provide a simple and rapid procedure for determining valproate levels in serum or other physiological fluids, which provides reproducible values and is specific for valproate. The simple structure of vaproic acid a saturated branched aliphatic acid makes it one of the smallest and simplest drugs to be considered as a haptenprotein antigen for production of antibodies. As such, in the design of any hapten derivatives of valproic acid, to be used in the conjugation to proteins for the preparation of antigenic conjugates, there is little guidance as to the effect of structural modification on the specificity of antibodies.Description of the Prior Art Matsumoto et al., Mass Spectrometry in DrugMetabolism by Frigero and Ghesalberli, Plenum PublishingCorp., N.Y., N.Y. 1977 and Kuhara s Matsumoto,Biomedical Mass Spectrometry, 1, 291 1974 teach that valproic acid is metabolized in humans via oxidationpredominantly at the positions ss and w to the carboxylic acid, and is eventually excreted in urine as the free acids or via glucuronide formation. U.S. Patent No.3,817,837 describes a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique for the determination of a wide variety of drugs.

In addition, the enzyme conjugates are able to compete with valproate for antibodies to provide a sensitive accurate assay. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity and understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
