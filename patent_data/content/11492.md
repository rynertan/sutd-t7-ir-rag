# Measuring vehicle wheel alignment parameters.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for dynamically measuring vehicle front end parameters such as tow in or toe out and camber angle. The apparatus includes a separate pair of support rollers 11 for supporting each vehicle front wheel 10 and causing rotation thereof. A sens ing roller 12 is adapted to contact the tyre tread surface at the lowermost point of the tyre so as to be rotated by rotation of the wheel. The axis of the sensing roller 12 is arranged transverse to the plane or rotation of the wheel 10 such that any toe in or toe out of the wheel causes a transverse or generally axial displacement of the sensing roller 12 to a position wherein the axis of the sensing roller is normal to the toe in or toe out direction of the wheel 10 . The sensing roller 12 is mounted on an axle 13 which forms one bar of a trapezium shaped four bar linkage 13,14,15 which causes said sensing roller 12 to pivot about an effective pivot point 16 which is arranged, by means of said linkage, a consider able distance away from the wheel 10 . The pivot point 16 is the point of intersection of the centre lines of the tapered sides 14 of the linkage since the bars of the linkage are pivotally interconnected. A further sensing roller for measur ing camber angle and methods of measuring toe in and camber angle are also disclosed and claimed.
