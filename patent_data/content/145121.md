This invention concerns novel tautomeric trans alkylated octahydropyrazolo 4,3 f quinolines, useful as anti hypertensive agents, a process for their preparation, and novel intermediates. Tautomeric trans 5 substituted 7 permissibly substituted 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro 1H and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinolines I and II , active prolactin inhibitors and useful in the treatment of Parkinsonism, are described in U.S. Patents 4,198,415, 4,230,861 and 4,367,231. in which R is C₁ C₃ alkyl or allyl. The hypotensive activity of one of the trans stereoisomers, 4aR,8aR 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro 1H and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline the tautomeric pair III and IV where R is n propyl is disclosed by Hahn The octahydropyrazoloquinolines of the above formula I IV are prepared according to Reaction Scheme I. wherein R is C₁ C₃ alkyl or allyl. In this scheme, a trans 1 alkyl or allyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline V is condensed with dimethylformamide dimethylacetal to yield VI which, on reaction with hydrazine, yields the tautomeric pair I and II . British published application 2,129,422 provides a method of resolving V to yield the trans 4aR,8aR stereoisomer Va , or trans stereoisomer condensation of which with dimethylformamide dimethylacetal yields VIa which, on reaction with hydrazine, yields the tautomeric pair III and IV . The corresponding trans pair is prepared in an analogous manner from the trans 4aS,9aS stereoisomer. British published application 2,130,576, provides an alternate intermediate, trans , trans or trans 7 formyl 1 alkyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline which, on reaction with hydrazine, yields the tautomeric pairs I and II or III and IV , and the trans pair depending on whether the trans racemate, the trans or the trans stereoisomer is used as the starting material. The bicyclic ketones V and Va are also used as a starting material to prepare a series of octahydro 2H pyrrolo 3,4 g quinolines via the intermediates VI and VIa which are condensed with a glycinate salt rather than hydrazine to yield the desired tricyclic compounds see U.S. Patent 4,311,844. Compounds of formulae I IV in which R is allyl and the corresponding pyrroloquinolines are prepared from products in which R is CN or benzyl, by removing the CN or benzyl group and then allylating the resulting secondary amine wherein R is H with an allyl halide under standard conditions. The prior art cited above does not provide octahydropyrazolo 3,4 g quinolines having an alkyl substituent in the 3 position of the pyrazole ring does not provide methods for their synthesis does not give a use. This invention provides tautomeric trans alkylated octahydropyrazolo 4,3 f quinolines of the structures XII and XIII below Structures represented by XII and XIII are tautomers i.e., there is a dynamic equilibrium between each pair of structures shown. When any single member of a tautomeric pair is described, it will be understood that the other tautomer is also described thereby. The compounds of formulae XII and XIII are prepared by reacting a compound of the formula The compounds of formulae XII and XIII can also be prepared by reacting trans tautomeric compounds of the formulae where R is C₁ C₃ alkyl or allyl and R In all of the above processes, the resolved trans or trans starting material can be used. The final product can also be resolved by conventional methods. Pharmaceutical formulations comprising as active ingredient a tautomeric mixture of compounds of formulae XII and XIII, the resolved stereoisomers thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, associated with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents therefor, are also a part of this invention. The compounds of formulae XII or XIII, their stereoisomers, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, can be used for treating hypertension in a mammal by administering to said mammal an effective amount of one or more of the compounds of formulae XII or XIII as defined above. The compounds are therefor useful as hypotensive agents. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formulae XII or XIII include salts derived from non toxic inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid and phosphorous acid, as well as salts derived from non toxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkandioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluoride, acetate, propionate, decanoate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, butyne 1,4 dioate, hexyne 1,6 dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, malate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene 1 sulfonate and naphthalene 2 sulfonate. Compounds represented by the above formulas have two asymmetric centers, at C 5a and C 9a in XII and XIII. Thus, tautomeric pairs, representing four stereoisomers occurring as two racemates, are indicated by XII and XIII. These racemates are designated as the cis and trans racemates. This invention includes only the latter racemates. The trans racemate 5aR,9aR stereoisomer for XII and XIII is designated by the following formulas. wherein R and R This invention also provides novel pyrazolo 4,3 f quinolines of the formulas XVIII and XIX wherein R has its previous meaning. XVIII and XIX correspond to XVI and XVII wherein R wherein R has its previous meaning. The trans tautomers have the opposite configuration for the bridgehead hydrogens. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof are also contemplated. Compounds illustrating the scope of formulae X XIII include the following Tautomeric pairs, of formulae XII XIII and XVI XVII, when R is C₁ C₃ alkyl or allyl and R The compounds of formulae XII and XIII are prepared according to Reaction Scheme II below. where R and R These pairs of products such as XXII and XXIII or XXIV and XXV can be separated into the individual isomers by chromatography. However, we prefer to carry out the cyclization reaction with hydrazine on the mixture of acylated 6 oxodecahydroquinolines to yield a mixture of pyrazoles and then to separate the resulting tautomeric pairs by chromatography. An alternate method exists for preparing the tautomeric pairs XII and XIII or XVI and XVII. This procedure is outlined in Reaction Scheme III below In Reaction Scheme III, the usual bicycloketone starting material XXVI V where R is restricted to C₁ C₃ alkyl , is reacted first with a 1,2 dithioethane derivative X S CH₂ CH₂ S X wherein X is a leaving group such as tosyl, benzenesulfonyl or mesyl in the presence of pyrrolidine and triethylamine to form a dithioketal at C 7 as a blocking group XXVII . The C 5 position is then acylated as before with a C₁ C₃ alkyl halide and lithium diisopropyl amide LDA, LiN CH CH₃ ₂ Cyclization with hydrazine, or salt or hydrate thereof produces the angular octahydropyrazolo 4,3 f quinoline tautomeric pair XXIX and XXX still carrying the thioketal blocking group, which group is readily removed, as by treatment with Raney nickel, to yield compounds of formulae XII and XIII. Tautomers of structures XVIII XIX and XX XXI are prepared by formylating the blocked ketone XVIII at C 5, employing any of the prior art formylating procedures, for example ethylformate and base. The reactive intermediate XXXIII The blocking group is readily removed, as before, with Raney Ni to yield the pair XVIII XIX. The above chemistry is equally adaptable to the preparation of the optically active tautomers XX XXI by starting with an optically active starting material XXXVI or its trans enantiomer. If it is desired to have a 6 allyl group in a final octahydropyrazolo 4,3 f quinoline, the compound can be prepared by removing the alkyl group R³ from the final tautomeric mixture, as with CNBr, thus forming a compound according to XII XIII above in which R is CN. Removal of the cyano group yields a derivative wherein R is H, and this secondary amine is readily allylated, as with allyl chloride, to yield the desired derivative. Those intermediates in which R is H can also be alkylated with a different alkyl group or alkylated with the same alkyl group containing a tagged radioactive or isotopic atom to yield useful products. This invention is further illustrated by the following specific examples. Preparation of trans 3 methyl 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro 1H and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline A 0.5M lithium diisopropylamide solution was prepared by adding 62.5 ml. of n butyl lithium 1.6 molar in hexane to 14 ml. of diisopropylamine in 100 ml. of THF at 0 C. After the preparation had been completed, the reagent was diluted to 200 ml. giving a 0.5 molar lithium diisopropylamide solution in tetrahydrofuran hexane solvent mixture. Twenty two ml. of this solution was placed in a dry 50 ml. round bottom flask and the solution cooled to about 78 C. One and ninety five hundredths grams of trans 1 n propyl 6 oxo decahydroquinoline in 5 ml. of THF were added to the solution and the resulting mixture stirred at about 78 C. for 30 minutes. Next, 1.06 ml. of acetyl chloride were added and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for two hours at room temperature and was then poured into water. The alkaline aqueous mixture was extracted several times with equal volumes of methylenedichloride. The methylenedichloride extracts were combined and dried and the methylenedichloride removed to yield 2.895 g. of an orange oil comprising trans 1 n propyl 6 oxo 7 acetyldecahydroquinoline formed in the above reaction. The product was purified by chromatography over silica using 4 methanol and methylenedichloride plus ammonia as the original eluant. The percent of methanol was raised to 7.5 and fractions containing trans 1 n propyl 6 oxo 5 acetyldecahydroquinoline were combined to yield after evaporation of the solvent 728 mg. of a yellow liquid. NMR indicated that these fractions were mixtures of the two products, trans 1 n propyl 6 oxo 7 acetyldecahydroquinoline and trans 1 n propyl 5 acetyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline. The above prepared mixture was dissolved in 20 ml. of methanol to which was added 2 ml. of hydrazine and sufficient 15 aqueous hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH to about 9. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for about one hour and then poured into dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide. The alkali insoluble materials were extracted in methylenedichloride. The methylenedichloride extract was dried and the solvent removed therefrom to yield 959 mg. of a yellow oil which was purified by chromatography over silica using 2 1 THF hexane solvent mixture containing also aqueous ammonium hydroxide. Fractions shown by TLC to contain trans 3 methyl 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro 1H and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline were combined to yield 406 mg. of a light yellow oil. The product had the following physical characteristics The hydrochloride salt was formed by dissolving the yellow oil in methylenedichloride ether solvent mixture and saturating with anhydrous gaseous hydrogen chloride. The resulting white solid consisting of trans 3 methyl 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro 1H and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline dihydrochloride was separated by filtration. Recrystallization from methanol yielded trans 3 methyl 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro 1H and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline dihydrochloride as fine white needles melting about 250 C. Preparation of trans 1 methyl 6 n propyl 4,5,5a,6,7,8,9,9a octahydro 2H and 3H pyrazolo 4,3 f quinoline The preparation of Example 1 was repeated using 3.9 g. of trans 1 n propyl 6 oxo decahydroquinoline starting material and about 88 ml. of 0.5M lithium diisopropylamine in THF solution. In this preparation, the LDA solution and starting material were combined at 0 C. after which time the temperature was reduced to 78 C. and the acetyl chloride added thereto. The reactions were worked up and the mixture products isolated as in Example 1. Five and one tenths grams of this mixture was reacted with 5 ml. of hydrazine in 25 ml. of methanol as in Example 1 to yield a mixture of the 4,3 f and 3,4 g isomeric pyrazolo quinolines. Chromatographic separation yielded 0.8 g. of trans 1 methyl 6 n propyl 4,5,5a,6,7,8,9,9a octahydro 2H and 3H pyrazolo 4,3 f quinoline and 1.8 g. of trans 3 methyl 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro 1H and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline. Trans 1 methyl 6 n propyl 4,5,5a,6,7,8,9,9a octahydro 2H and 3H pyrazolo 4,3 f quinoline had the following physical characteristics Preparation of trans 3 ethyl 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro 1H and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline and trans 1 ethyl 6 n propyl 4,5,5a,6,7,8,9,9a octahydro 2H and 3H pyrazolo 4,3 f quinoline Following the procedure of Example 1, about 44 ml. of a 0.5M lithium diisopropylamine solution were cooled to 78 C. Three and nine tenths grams of trans 1 n propyl 6 oxo decahydroquinoline in THF were added and the reaction stirred at 78 C. for 30 minutes. Two and six tenths ml. of propionyl chloride were then added and the reaction mixture warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight at that temperature. The reaction was worked up and the product isolated with the procedure of Example 1. About 4.2 g. of a mixture containing trans 1 n propyl 6 oxo 7 propionyldecahydroquinoline and the 5 propionyl isomer were obtained. The mixture caused to react with hydrazine in methanol without further purification to yield a mixture of the two pyrazole isomers. These isomers were separated by chromatography over silica gel using the same solvent system as previously. Trans 3 ethyl 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro 1H and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline thus prepared was converted to both the dihydrobromide and dihydrochloride salts. Melting point 271 275 C. after recrystallization from methanol ethyl acetate infrared spectrum CHCl₃ 3464, 3210, 2951, 1625, 1461 The dihydrochloride salt of the isomeric material trans 1 ethyl 6 n propyl 4,5,5a,6,7,8,9,9a octahydro 2H and 3H pyrazolo 4,3 f quinoline separated by the above chromatographic procedure was converted to the dihydrobromide which melted at 289 C. Preparation of trans 6 n propyl 4,5,5a,6,7,8,9,9a octahydro 2H and 3H pyrazolo 4,3 f quinoline A reaction mixture was prepared from 1 g. of trans 1 n propyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline and 0.355 g. of pyrrolidine 0.43 ml. in 50 ml. of acetonitrile. A 4A molecular sieve was added and the reaction mixture stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere at reflux temperature for about three hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and 2 ml. of triethylamine were added followed by 2 g. of 1,2 ditosyl thioethane. The resulting reaction mixture was heated to reflux temperature overnight with stirring under a nitrogen blanket. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered and the solvent removed from the filtrate by evaporation A reaction mixture containing 0.9 g. of trans 1 n propyl 6 oxo 7 spiro 1 ,3 dithiolanodecahydroquinoline and 2.5 g. of tris dimethylamino methane in 30 ml. of toluene were refluxed with stirring for about 4 hours, at which time TLC indicated starting material was no longer present. Volatile constituents were removed A desulfurization mixture was prepared from 0.63 g. of the above compound, 4.8 ml. of Raney Ni and 50 ml. of anhydrous ethanol. The mixture was refluxed with stirring for about 3 hours and was then filtered. Evaporation of the solvent Following the above procedure, trans or trans 1 n propyl 6 oxo 7 spiro 1 ,3 dithiolanodecahydroquinoline can be reacted with an acyl halide and 0.5M lithium diisopropylamide LDA reagent in tetrahydrofuran hexane solvent mixture. The 5 acyl 6 oxo 7 spiro 1 ,3 dithiolanodecahydroquinoline thus produced can be cyclized with hydrazine to yield a pyrazole derivative of Example 1, or 2 containing a spirodithioketal at 7. The thioketal group can then be removed according to the above procedure to give trans or trans 1 C₁ C₃ alkyl 6 n propyl 4,5,5a,6,7,8,9,9a octahydro 2H and 3H pyrazolo 4,3 f quinoline. The Tosyl S CH₂ ₂ is prepared by the procedure of Organic Synthesis, In the above example, there are several preparations of compounds of formula XXII and XXIII when R¹ is methyl, ethyl or n propyl. We have also developed procedures, described in our co pending application, EP A 139393, for the prepation of intermediates wherein R¹ can also be C₁ C₃ alkoxy. The process described therein for the preparation of compounds of formula Va initially produces an isomeric mixture which can be separated to produce the intermediates represented by formula XXXVII and XXXVIII below. wherein R has its previous meaning. While all of the above examples have delineated the preparation of compounds starting with a trans bicyclic decahydroquinolinone, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that identical chemistry would be involved in transforming a trans isomer into the corresponding optically active trans stereoisomeric products and that the trans tautomers can be prepared in similar fashion.
