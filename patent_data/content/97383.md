## Description
MOULDING COMPOSITIONS The present invention is concerned with a moulding composition comprising a an unsaturated, crosslinkable thermosetting resin b an ethylenically unsaturated monomer c a reinforcing agent, a filler or mixtures thereof as additive and d a normally solid, carboxy containing styrene butadiene block copolymer. Such a composition is useful e.g. as bulk moulding composition BMC or sheet moulding composition SMC , which should exhibit a high impact strength, a smooth surface and low shrinkage low profile characteristics. USP 4,020,036 discloses a moulding composition comprising an unsaturated polyester, a normally solid carboxy contaihing styrene butadiene block copolymer, a vinyl monomer, a catalyst, a reinforcing agent and a filler. Although this reference discloses a composition comprising a normally solid, carboxy containing styrenebutadiene block copolymer, it does not specify how to prepare these carboxy containing block copolymers. Furthermore, the vinyl content in the butadiene part of the block copolymer may vary over a wide range of from 5 to 76 percent according to this preference. It has now been found that a moulding composition, comprising an unsaturated, crosslinkable thermosetting resin, an ethylenically unsaturated monomer, a reinforcing agent and or a filler and a normally solid carboxy containing styrene butadiene block copolymer, exhibits an improved impact strength and an improved surface gloss together with low profile low shrinkage characteristics as BMC orSMC, provided the carboxy containing styrene butadiene block copolymer has been prepared in a specific way and provided the 1,2 vinyl content of the butadiene part of the block copolymer corresponds to specific values. Accordingly, the present invention is concerned with a moulding composition comprising a an unsaturated, crosslinkable thermosetting resin b an ethylenically unsaturated monomer c a reinforcing agent, a filler or mixtures thereof as additive and d a normally solid, carboxy containing styrene butadiene block copolymer, characterized in that the moulding composition comprises a normally solid, carboxy containing styrene butadiene block copolymer prepared by contacting a monolithium terminated styrene butadiene block copolymer solution with carbon dioxide by introducing dry gaseous carbon dioxide into said polymer solution at a temperature of from 200C to 100µC, at a pressure of from 103 kPa abs to 793 kPa abs and at a molar ratio of carbon dioxide added to lithium terminated block copolymer of from 0.75 1 to 3.0 1, the butadiene portion of the monolithium terminated styrene butadiene block copolymer having prior to the contact of this block copolymer with carbon dioxide a micro structure of between 30 and 40 mol percent 1,2 vinyl, between 20 and 30 mol percent 1,4 cis and between 30 and 50 mol percent 1,4 trans. A key aspect of the present invention is the microstructure of the butadiene block of the styrene butadiene block copolymer abbreviated SB block copolymer . This microstructure, as determined by conventional infra red analysis using the 910 cm 1 band, is as follows expressed in mol percent Preferred 1,2 vinyl 30 to 40 35 1,4 cis 20 to 30 25 1,4 trans 30 to 50 40 The desired weight average molecular weights of the styrene block and butadiene block of each block copolymer arm are PreferredStyrene block 8,000 to 20,000 11,000 to 15,000Butadiene block 30,000 to 100,000 60,000 to 80,000 The carboxy containing polymer is typically prepared by anionic polymerization employing an organomonolithium initiator.The first step of the process involves contacting the styrene monomer and the organo monolithium compound in the presence of an inert diluent therein forming a living polymer compound having the simplified structure S Li. The inert diluent may be an aromatic or naphthenic hydrocarbon, e.g., benzene or cyclohexane, which may be modified by the presence of an alkene or alkane such as pentenes or pentanes.Specific examples of suitable diluents include n pentane, n hexane, isooctane, cyclohexane, toluene, benzene and xylene. The organomonolithium compounds are represented by the formula RLi wherein R is an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic radical, or combinations thereof, preferably containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms per molecule. A much preferred initiator is sec butyllithium. The concentration of the initiator can be regulated to control the molecular weight of the polymer. Generally, the initiator concentration is in the range of about 0.25 to 50 millimoles per 100 grams of monomer although both higher and lower initiator levels can be used if desired. The required initiator level frequently depends upon the solubility of the initiator in the hydrocarbon diluent.These polymerization reactions are usually carried out at a temperature in the range of 51 C to 1490C and at pressures which are sufficient to maintain the reaction mixture in the liquid phase. Next, the living polymer in solution is contacted with a butadiene monomer. The resulting living polymer has a simplified structure S B Li. The medium vinyl polybutadiene block is readily obtained by employing a small amount of a polar material as a vinyl promoter. The vinyl promoter conveniently is added to the hydrocarbon diluent at the appropriate time in the polymerization sequence. These promoters can be selected from ethers, tertiary amines, and other promoters. Preferred are dimethoxybenzene, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, methyl ethyl ether, ethyl propyl ether, di n propyl ether, di n octyl ether, anisole, dibenzyl ether, diphenyl ether, dimethylethylamine, tri n propylamine, tri nbutylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, N ,N dimethylaniline, N ethylpiperidine, N methyl N ethylaniline, N methylmorpholine andN,N,N ,N tetramethylethylenediamine.The amount of polar compound employed will vary widely with the choice of vinyl promoter, but should be that amount necessary to prdmote the degree of vinylization desired. An exemplary amount would be in the range of about 0.01 to 25 parts by weight per hundred parts monomer. The average molecular weights of the polystyrene blocks of the block copolymer are determined by gel permeation chromatography, whereas the polystyrene content of the polymer is measured by infra red spectroscopy of the finished polymer. After formation of the butadiene block, the living polymer is contacted with carbon dioxide, by introducing dry gaseous carbon dioxide in the living polymer solution. A second key aspect of the present invention is that said contact is carried out at a temperature between 20iC and 100iC and at a pressure between 103 and 793 kPa abs. and that the amount of C02 added is such that the molar ratio of C02 added to SB Li is between 0.75 1 and 3.0 1, preferably between 1.0 1 and 2.0 1. Under these circumstances a mixture of block copolymer structures is obtained comprising 20 80 preferably 40 60 percent weight of uncoupled block copolymer, 10 40 preferably 15 25 percent weight of coupled linear block copolymer and 10 40 preferably 25 35 percent weight of coupled radial block copolymer, comprising a minor amount of radial block copolymers having four arms. The uncoupled block copolymer probably comprisesla mixture of block copolymer structures differing with respect to the terminating group only, Next the polymer is recovered by known finishing techniques. The unsaturated, crosslinkable thermosetting resins include both unsaturated vinyl ester resins and unsaturated polyester resins. The vinyl ester resins are typically prepared by the esterification of polyepoxides with ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids in the presence of onium salts of inorganic acids. The vinyl ester resins have a typical formula EMI5.1 and are prepared by reacting a glycidyl polyether of a polyhydric phenol with an acrylic acid in the presence of an onium salt. The composition of the polymerizable unsaturated polyester resin component of the moulding compositions of this invention may be varied widely. The polymerizable unsaturated polyester portion thereof is ordinarily prepared by the reaction of an alpha, betaethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, or an admixture of such an acid with a saturated dicarboxylic acid, and a dihydric alcohol.Among the ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids which may be used are maleic acid, fumaric acid, mesaconic acid, aconitic acid, citraconic acid, ethyl maleic acid, xeronic acid and itaconic acid.Halogen substituted derivatives of these acids may also be utilized.The anhydrides of these acids, where the anhydrides exist, are embraced under the term acid since the reaction products or polyesters obtained by utilizing such acids and anhydrides are the same, and, in fact, in many instances it is preferred to utilize the anhydride rather than the free acid. The dihydric alcohol component of the polyester includes such compounds as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, 1,3 propanediol, 1,2 propanediol, di 1,3propanediol, butylene glycol and halogen substituted glycols. Small amounts of polyols with a functionality greater than two may be utilized in conjunction with the dihydric component. As indicated hereinabove, in many instances it is desirable to utilize a portion of a saturated dicarboxylic acid in conjunction with the ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid component.Examples of useful saturated acids include phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephathalic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dimethyl succinic acid, as well as halogenated derivatives of the above acids. The inclusion of a saturated dicarboxylic acid, such as described hereinabove, in an unsaturated polyester resin does not alter the beneficial effects realized from the addition of a small quantity of the carboxy containing polymer. Generally, a saturated dicarboxylic acid is included as one of the components utilized in the preparation of an unsaturated polyester resin as some physical properties are improved by such inclusion. The term unsaturated polyester resin as used in the resin industry is interpreted as a resin utilizing an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid as at least a portion of the acid component of the polyester therefore, the term embraces those resins which also utilize a saturated dicarboxylic acid as a portion of the acid component. The cross linkable polyester resins and vinyl ester resins obtained can be readily cross linked by uniting them with ethylenically unsaturated monomers, i.e., monomeric compounds containing a Cz s Croup. Styrene and vinyl toluene are most frequently utilized as the cross linking monomer, although many other monomers may also be employed. Styrene is the most preferred monomer.Such other monomers include divinyl benzene, ethyl alpha methyl styrene, chloro and fluoro styrenes, diallyl phthalate, triallyl cyanurate, allyl diglycolate, diallyl phenyl phosphonate, diethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , 1,2 propylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , bis allyl lactate carbonate, allyl succinyl allyl glycolate, allyl maleate, methallyl maleate, alkyl methacrylates such as methyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate, alkyl acrylates such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate and butyl acrylate, vinyl acetate and allyl acetate. The catalysts used in this invention are conventional free radical polymerization initiators selected from among organic peroxides and the hydroperoxides such as benzoyl peroxide dicumyl peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, lauryl peroxide, cyclohexanone peroxide, t butyl perbenzoate, t butyl hydroperoxide, t butylbenzene hydroperoxide, cumune hydroperoxide and t butyl peroctoate. In addition, azo compounds such as azobis isobutyronitrile can be employed. A presently preferred catalyst is t butyl perbenzoate. The reinforcing agents used in this invention comprise fibres selected from glass, asbestos, carbon, graphite, metal, synthetic polymers such as polyamides, polyesters, polyolefins and natural fibres such as cotton, jute, hemp, sisal, flax, wood, paper and the like. A preferred fibre is glass. The fibres can be used in the form of mats, fabrics, threads and chopped fibres. Another typical component in SMC and BMC is a thickening agent.These agents are usually oxides or hydroxides of a Group II metal.These agents include specifically oxides and hydroxides of magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium and zinc. In addition to the previously named components of the compositions of this invention other optional additives can be used.These include fillers, pigments, colorants, lubricants, stabilizers and silane coupling agents. Fillers include calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, talc, clay, alumina, aluminium hydroxide, antimony trioxide, silica, mica, barium sulphate, calcium sulphate and mixtures thereof. Preferred fillers include calcium carbonate, clay, talc and surface treated fillers. A lubricant such as aluminium, barium, calcium, magnesium or zinc stearate can be used to impart mould release properties to the compositions. Conventional colorants and pigments such as Ti02, carbon black, phthalocyanine pigments and mixtures thereof can be employed in amounts sufficient to give the desired colour to the final moulded product. The ingredients are incorporated by a milling technique which involves moderate to high shear. This can be accomplished by means of twin rotor mixers designed to give moderate shear to the paste like ingredients. It is essential to provide some shear and because of the viscosity of the materials being mixed, proper mixing cannot be obtained simply by stirring or by using a conventional impeller mixer. On the other hand, high intensity mixing would generate excessive heat above 35 C and activation of the catalyst which must be avoided. Sheet moulding compounding line mixing equipment can also be used. This mixing under sufficient shear to achieve good dispersion of the ingredients without heat build up activating the catalyst insures a good blend and is necessitated by the fact that the carboxyl polymer is a normally solid material.Shear which gives a hat build up of 1 50, preferably 2 30iC is satisfactory. Low shear is preferred for BMC to avoid glass degradation. The curing can be don at a tmpratut known in the art for the particular catalyst utilized. Generally a temperature of 100 C to 290 C and a time of 1 to 15 minutes in a press is sufficient. The relative amounts of each component are readily determined and adjusted by one skilled in the art. Relative amounts of various components are expressed below in parts by weight Typical BMC Formulation unsaturated thermosetting 30 to 50 42 resin ethylenically unsaturated 35 to 60 46 monomer filler 100 to 200 150 glass fibres 75 to 150 100 carboxy containing 8 to 20 12 polymer thickening agent 1 to 4 2 mould release agent 2 to 6 4 catalyst 0.5 to 3 1 The invention is further illustrated by means of the following examples.EXAMPLE 1 Various bulk moulding compositions BMC were prepared with varying types of rubbers, The formulation for the BMC was as follows expressed in parts by weight Component Amount Unsaturated polyester 42 Rubber additive 12 Styrene monomer 46 Glass roving 100 Calcium carbonate 150 Zinc stearate 4 T butyl perbenzoate TBPB 1 M negium oxide 2 In the formulations1 the polyester employed was a propyl glycol maleate polyester resin. Zn actual practice, the polyester was combined with 18 parts of the styrene monomer while the rubber additive was separately combined with the remaining 28 parts styrene monomer. The various components were mixed under standard conditions.Then plaques were compression moulded from each component for 2 minutes at 1750C peak exotherm and 6894 kPa. Each plaque was then evaluated to determine its physical properties. All the rubber components employed in the BMC are based on alkyl lithium prepared styrene butadiene block copolymers. Three of the polymers are uncoupled diblocks block copolymers 1, 9 and 10 , with one block copolymer 9 having a higher vinyl content for the butadiene portion. The other polymers are coupled with various coupling agents. The degree of coupling is shown in Table 1 by reference to the various species SB1, SB2, SB3, SB4. For example, SB2 signifies a polymer species having the structure SB x BS while SB3 signifies a polymer species having the structureEMI10.1 where x is the coupling residue.Some of the polymers were coupled or reacted with C02. These are block copolymers 7, 8 and 11. Only block copolymer 7 is according to the invention the 1,2 vinyl content of the butadiene portion in the other two polymers is too low.
