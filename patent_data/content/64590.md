# High speed binary counter.

## Abstract
A plurality of two stage Gray code counters are con nected in series to generate a multiple bit pseudo Gray code count C₀, C₁, ..., C₇. A binary count B₀, B₁, ..., B₇ is then generated by using the odd subscripted bits C₁, C₃, C₅, C₇ of the pseudo Gray code as the binary count bits B₁, B₃, B₅, B₇ and generating the even subscripted bits of the binary count B₀, B₂, B₄, B₆ by Exclusive ORing the odd and even position counts of each two stage Gray code counter together in Exclusive OR circuits.
