# A process of electroless depositing nickel phosphorus alloys.

## Abstract
The rate of electroless deposition of a nickel phosphorus film on a substrate is substantially increased without affecting film properties or causing adverse consequences to the plating bath by raising the boiling point of the plating bath and employing a higher process temperature than previously used. The boiling point of the bath is raised by increasing the ambient pressure over the bath and or adding a glycol to the bath. Excellent deposited film qualities can be obtained at a substantially higher rate than in conventional electroless plating and no nucleation sites are created in the bath to cause spontaneous decomposition of the bath.

## Claims
1. A process of electroless depositing a nickel phosphorus alloy on a suitable substrate in which the substrate is placed in an aqueous bath containing nickel ions, hypophosphite ions and a complexing agent while the bath is kept at a predetermined process temperature below its boiling point, characterised by raising the boiling point of the bath by increasing the ambient pressure above the surface of the bath and or adding a glycol to the bath in an amount which is ineffective to substantially alter the reactivity of the bath, and then employing a higher process temperature than can be employed when the boiling point of the bath is not so raised.

## Description
This invention relates to a process of electroless depositing nickel phosphorus alloys. In autocatalytic plating also referred to as electroless plating or deposition a chemical reducing agent in solution reduces metallic ions to a metal which is deposited on a suitable substrate. The plating takes place only on catalytic surfaces rather than throughout the solution. The catalyst is initially the substrate, and subsequently the metal which is deposited on the substrate. Electroless plating is a well known technique for the plating of nickel phosphorus alloys. A typical plating bath for the electroless deposition of nickel phosphorus includes a nickel salt, a reducing agent such as sodium hypophosphite NaH₂PO₂ , a complexing agent to help keep the nickel in solution and a compound which increases the stability of the bath. The deposition rate of nickel phosphorus on the substrate is a function of, among other things, the pH and the operating temperature of the bath. While it is desired to operate the bath at as high a temperature as possible, localised boiling within the bath profoundly disrupts the transport of the nickel to the substrate, resulting in unacceptable film properties. In addition, localised boiling causes precipitation of nickel within the bath which can result in spontaneous decomposition. Certain types of materials referred to as exaltants increase the deposition rate without increasing the operating temperature of the bath. The mechanism by which they speed up deposition has not been explained completely. A detailed description of electroless nickel phosphorus deposition is found in US A 3,158,500 discloses nickel phosphorus alloy plating processes in which the ambient pressure over the bath is increased. However, that prior document does not disclose or suggest carrying out the plating process at an elevated temperature at the higher ambient pressure. The present invention seeks to improve the conventional process for electroless depositing nickel phosphorus alloy, by increasing the operating temperature of the plating bath without affecting the properties of the deposited film and without causing spontaneous decomposition. A process of electroless depositing a nickel phosphorus alloy on a suitable substrate in which the substrate is placed in an aqueous bath containing nickel ions, hypophosphite ions and a complexing agent while the bath is kept at a predetermined process temperature below its boiling point, is characterised, according to the invention, by raising the boiling point of the bath by increasing the ambient pressure above the surface of the bath and or adding a glycol to the bath in an amount which is ineffective to substantially alter the reactivity of the bath, and then employing a higher process temperature than can be employed when the boiling point of the bath is not so raised. The bath is of the type in which the rate of deposition of the nickel phosphorus alloy is substantially independent of the concentration of ions over a predetermined range of concentrations. The plating rate is increased by altering either or both the bath composition and the atmosphere above the bath so that the reaction within the bath can occur at a temperature substantially higher, but without localised boiling and its adverse consequences. In one embodiment, ethylene glycol, which does not ionise to alter the reactivity of the bath solution or the effect of the complexing agent, is added to the bath. The glycol elevates the boiling point of the bath and thus permits the operating temperature of the bath to be substantially increased beyond its original boiling point, thereby increasing the deposition rate of the nickel phosphorus on the substrate. Alternatively, the ambient pressure of the gas above the surface of the bath is increased, for example by providing a sealed enclosure over the bath. Since the vapour pressure above the solution is thus increased, the boiling point is elevated and deposition can be conducted at an increased rate. In another embodiment of the improved process the container for the bath is surrounded by a liquid which is held in a second container and a glycol is added to both the bath and the surrounding liquid. The glycol is added to the bath and the surrounding liquid in amounts such that the boiling point of the surrounding liquid is lower than that of the bath. Both containers are provided with a sealed enclosure to increase the ambient pressure of the gas above the bath and the surrounding liquid. As the surrounding liquid cannot be heated beyond its boiling point the temperature of the bath is maintained at a relatively constant temperature below its boiling point, which has been elevated by the addition of the glycol and by the increased ambient pressure of the gas above the bath surface. How the invention can be carried out will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which The nickel phosphorus plating bath to which the improved process of this invention was applied consisted of 20 by volume of Niculoy 22M 7.2 grams per litre of nickel , 3.3 by volume of Niculoy 22S 38.6 grams per litre of Na₂HPO₂ , and 76.7 distilled water. Niculoy 22M and 22S are proprietary bath solutions available from Shipley Company, Inc. and together include complexing and stabilising agents. The pH of this bath is approximately 4.6 to 4.8 and the boiling point is 100.3 C. The conventional process for nickel plating with this bath includes heating the bath to 93.3 C and periodically replenishing the bath in order to maintain the nickel concentration within a predetermined range. This process results in nickel plating at a rate of approximately 10µm hr. In one embodiment of the improved process, the above process was modified by adding ethylene glycol in various amounts and heating the solution to temperatures above 93.3 C. The solid line in Figure 1 illustrates various bath temperatures as a function of the mole ratio of ethylene glycol to the total bath solution including the added ethylene glycol. For example, when ethylene glycol was added so that the bath contained approximately 40 by volume of ethylene glycol, which constituted a mole ratio of 0.176, the boiling point of the bath was elevated to 105.5 C. The plating process occurred just below this temperature so that no localised boiling occurred. This resulted in a plating rate of approximately 15.6 µm hr. The nickel films formed with the process utilising the addition of ethylene glycol to the plating bath showed excellent quality. In addition, no precipitation of any nickel occurred within the solution. While ethylene glycol is a preferred glycol to elevate the boiling point of the plating bath, other glycols which do not alter the reactivity in the bath or produce any other adverse effect would function equally as well. It is also possible to increase the deposition rate without adversely affecting film quality by increasing the ambient pressure of the gas over the surface of the plating bath. This has the effect of elevating the boiling point of the bath and thus permitting the plating bath to be operated at a higher temperature but below the temperature at which localised boiling occurs. The pressure is increased by providing a sealed enclosure over the surface of the bath. This can be used alone or in conjunction with the addition of glycol to elevate the boiling point of the bath. The dotted line in Figure 1 illustrates increased deposition rate and boiling points for various mole ratios of ethylene glycol to total bath solution when the ambient pressure over the surface of the bath was increased to two atmospheres. An embodiment of the present invention which utilises both the addition of glycol to raise the boiling point of the bath and increased ambient pressure over the bath is shown in Figure 2. The plating bath containing ethylene glycol is held within container 10. A second container 12 holding water and ethylene glycol surrounds contain 10 so that the liquid in container 12 surrounds the outside of container 10. A lid 14 having a safety pressure release value 16 provides a sealed cover for container 12. Ethylene glycol is added to the bath container 10 and to the water in container 12 in amounts so that the boiling point of the surrounding liquid in container 12 at the operating pressure is the desired operating temperature of the plating bath. Both the bath solution and the surrounding liquid are provided with a sealed enclosure, as shown by lid 14, which increases the ambient pressure over the bath and surrounding liquid, thereby elevating the boiling point of both. The exterior of container 12 is then heated until the liquid in container 12 reaches its boiling point, at which point the bath is maintained at a constant temperature generally equal to the boiling point of the surrounding liquid in container 12. The surrounding liquid in container 12 also provides a generally even heat transfer to the plating bath. Since the atmosphere is composed of steam at a higher pressure than the vapour pressure of the bath, there is no loss of water from the bath and no creation of nickel salt crystals, which are a common source of nucleation sites for spontaneous decomposition of the bath, around the evaporating edge of the bath. The sealed enclosure keeps dust or undesirable particles out of the solution which could also serve as nucleation sites for spontaneous decomposition of the bath. It might be expected that the addition of substantial amounts of glycol to the bath would substantially alter the viscosity of the bath and thus retard the movement of ions to the substrate. In addition, it might be expected that the large volumes of glycol present would modify the solubility of the nickel containing salt as well as the dielectric constant of the solution, all of which would have a substantial impact on the deposition rate. However, we have found that exercise of the invention enables the rate of deposition to be substantially increased without affecting the quality of the deposited film.
