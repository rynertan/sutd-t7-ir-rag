# Improvements in self energising disc brakes.

## Abstract
A pressure plate for a self energising disc brake of the spreading type is provided with angularly spaced integrally cast ears 22 which project inwardly from the inner peripher al edge of the plate, and a recess or dimple 24 is also cast integrally in each ear 22 in the face of the ear 22 adjacent to the braking face 12 . A region 26 of each ear 22 outwardly of the recess of dimple 24 defines an abutment face forming an anchorage for one end of an anchorage portion of a tension return spring with the recess or dimple 24 accommodating the free end of the anchorage portion. In a modification each abutment face 26 may be machined in the respective ear by turning down the ear over an arcuate area passing through the centre of the recess or dimple and using the braking face 12 as a datum.
