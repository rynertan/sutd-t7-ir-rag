# SPREADER PROPELLER APPARATUS FOR TUBULAR KNITTED FABRIC

## Abstract
A propeller spreader for tubular knitted fabric is dis closed, in which internal, fabric edge engaging propeller belts are driven by means of magnetic coupling with inter nal, magnetic drive sheaves. A spreader frame, of flat con figuration, arranged to laterally distend tubular knitted fab ric to flat, two layer form, is supported by means of a pair of spaced, transversely extending rollers. Magnetically cou pled drive elements are positioned between the transverse support rollers and are driven to rotate in synchronism with the rotations of the support rollers. Ideally, the spreader frame is supported and positioned exclusively by means of the transverse support rollers, in conjunction with the mag netic attraction of the magnetically coupled drive means.
