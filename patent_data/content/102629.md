# Stripping compositions and methods of stripping resists.

## Abstract
Stripping compositions for removing resist materials from substrates comprise compositions of a 2 pyrrolidinone compound and a dialkyl sulfone compound. Either or both of polyethylene glycol and a diethylene glycol monoalkyl ether may be added to provide even more effective stripping compositions.
