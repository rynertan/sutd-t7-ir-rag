## Description
MANUFACTURE OF a ARYLALKANOIC ACIDS AND PRECURSORS The present invention relates to processes and novel intermediates utilized therein for preparing pharmaceutically useful a arylalkanoic acids. In pa r tacular, the present invention utilizes novel a hydroxy alkyl aryl ketals activated with a labile ester leaving group, which are solvolytically and non catalytically rearranged to the corresponding cx aryl alkanoic acids or esters, ortho esters or amides thereof. Optional concomitant or sequential hydrolysis of any ester, ortho ester or amide formed yields the corresponding and desired a arylalkanoic acids, which in turn can be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts in a manner known per se. Numerous a arylalkanoic acids i.e. 2 arylalkanoic acids have been described and developed and found to be useful as pharmaceutical agents exhibiting anti inflammatory, analgesic and anti pyretic activity.For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,385,386, describes certain 2 phenylpropionic acids useful for their antiinflammatory activity. Particularly noteworthy of the compounds described therein is 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic acid, known generically as ibuprofen. U.S.Patent No. 3,600,437 describes 2 3 phenoxyphenyl and 2 3 phenylthiophenyl alkanoic acids among other related compounds. Particularly noteworthy therein is the compound 2 3 phenoxyphenyl propionic acid, which is known generically as fenoprofen. U.S. 3,624,142 describes fluoro substituted biphenyl alkanoic acids, among which is 2 4 fluoro 4 biphenyl propionic acid.U.S. 3,755,427 describes additional fluoro substituted biphenylpropionic acids, among which is 2 2 fluoro4 biphenyl propionic acid, known as flurbiprofen. U.S.3,904,682 describes the compound 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid, which is known generically as naproxen and is a potent anti inflammatory compound. Related compounds are described in Belgian Patent No. 747,812.U.S. Patent 3,912,748 describes 5 and 6 benzoxyazoylalkanoic acids possessing anti inflammatory, anti pyrretic and analgesic activity. Notable among those compounds is 2 4 chlorophenyl 5 benzoxazoyl propionic acid, known generically as benoxaprofen. Thus, it can be seen that a tremendous variety of useful a arylalkanoic acids are known. Other known, useful a arylalkanoic acids are exemplified by 6 chloro a methyl 9H carbazole 2 acetic acid carprofen , a methyl 9H fluorene 2 acetic acid cicloprofen , 3 chloro a methyl 4 2 thienylcarbonyl benzene acetic acid cliprofen , a methyl 3 phenyl 7benzofuranacetic acid furaprofen , 4 1,3 dihydro l oxo 2H isoindol 2 yl benzene acetic acid indoprofen , 3 ben zoyl or methylbenzene acetic acid ketoprof en , 3 chloro 4 2,5 dihydro lH pyrrol l yl benzeneacetic acid pirprofen , a methyl 4 2 thienylcarbonyl benzeneacetic acid suprofen and compounds related thereto. Numerous processes for the manufacture of such a arylalkanoic acids have also been described. Such processes have been described in the aforementioned patents and in other patents and in the non patent literature as well. For example, U.S. Patent No.4,135,051 describes a process route for preparing the ester precursors of many of the useful a arylalkanoic acids utilizing trivalent thallium salts as reactants.Such a process suffers from the disadvantage that the thallium salts employed are toxic chemicals which must be removed from the final product. U.S. Patent 3,975,431 describes the preparation of a arylalkanoic acids from glycidonitriles through enol acylates. U.S. PatentsNos. 3,658,863 3,663,584, 3,658,858 3,694,476 and 3,959,364 describe various coupling methods for preparing arylalkanoic acids. More recently, U.K. Patent publication No. 2,042,543 published September 24, 1980, corresponding to application Serial No. 8005752, filedFebruary 20, 1980 describes a process for preparing the ester precursor of arylalkanoic acids from a haloalkyl aryl ketones using a metal catalyst for catalytically inducing rearrangement in an acidic, alcoholic medium, the catalyst being silver I salts of organic and or inorganic anions.The high costs associated with utilizing metal catalysts, particularly silver, in a large scale process is an inherent disadvantage to such a process. Accordingly, there remains a need for a simple, economical process for producing a arylalkanoic acids of the types described. In the process of the present invention, a non catalytic, solvolytic rearrangement of a ketal or thioketal of an a hydroxy alkyl aryl ketone is effected by activating the a hydroxy moiety with an esterifying agent to form the corresponding alkyl aryl ketal or thioketal ester substrate. The ester group is chosen to be sufficiently labile to disassociate from the substrate upon contact with a protic or dipolar, aprotic solvent medium. The ester substrate is maintained in contact with the protic or dipolar, aprotic solvent or a mixture thereof for a time sufficient to form the a arylalkanoic acid or ester, ortho ester or amide thereof, and optional concomitant or sequential hydrolysis of any ester, ortho ester or amide formed affords the corresponding a arylalkanoic acid. The latter can be conveniently converted into its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, most preferably its sodium salt.The solvolytic rearrangement of the ester substrate to form the a arylalkanoic acid, ester ortho ester or amide thereof may be carried out in the absence of water or in the substantial absence thereof and under acidic conditions.

In another aspect, the invention comprises ketal intermediates of the formulaeEMI10.1 wherein R1, R7 and R8 are as defined above and Y is hydroxy or alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl or aralkyl sulfonyloxy. The process of the present invention utilizes as starting materials a hydroxy ketals or thioketals of compounds of the formulaEMI10.2 wherein Ar is an aryl moiety of a useful acid product and R1 is an alkyl radical having from 1 8 carbon atoms, especially 1 4 carbon atoms, or a cycloalkyl radical having from 3 7 carbon atoms inclusive. The alkyl radicals represented by R1 are exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl and octyl and the branched chain isomers thereof. Representative of the cycloalkyl radicals having 3 7 carbon atoms are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cyclopheptyl. Those starting materials wherein R1 is alkyl having 1 4 carbon atoms, and particularly methyl, are presently preferred. The aryl moieties comprehended by Ar include aryl and aralkyl groups generally. The aryl groups include carbocyclic radicals having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms.The carbocyclic radicals may be monocyclic as represented by the phenyl radical or they may be condensed having at least two rings with at least two carbon atoms in common. Examples of condensed aryl radicals are the naphthyl, the indenyl, the anthryl, the acenaphthyl, the indanyl and the biphenyl radicals and the like. The carbocyclic radicals can carry additional substituents, for example 1 to 3 alkyl radicals and or alkoxy radicals having 1 8 carbon atoms, especially 1 4 carbon atoms, and or an alkanoyl radical with up to 12 carbon atoms and or 1 to 3 halogen atoms, more particularly 1 to 3 fluorine, chlorine or bromine atoms and or an aroyl radical with up to 12 carbon atoms and or a nitro group.

Examples of unsaturated isocyclic radicals are the phenyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclopentenyl and the naphthyl radicals.Examples of the saturated isocyclic radicals are the cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl, cycloheptyl and the cyclopropyl radicals. Additionally, the carbocyclic radicals may be linked to one or more up to 4 rings directly by simple bonds to form a ring assembly in accordance with IUPACRule A 51. Such a ring assembly may include 5 to 26 carbon atoms, including the carbon atoms of the substituents. Examples of such carbocyclic ring structures include the 4 cyclohexylphenyl, the 4 biphenyl, the 3 biphenylyl, the 5 cyclohexyl l indanyl, the 4 l cyclohexen l yl phenyl and the 5 phenyl lnaphthyl radicals and the like. Those ring assemblies can carry from 1 to 3 substituents such as described above. The aryl moieties as represented by Ar are additionally exemplified by those moieties disclosed inU.S.Patent Nos. 3,385,386 3,660,437 3,624,142 3,755,427 3,904,682 3,912,748 and Belgian Patent No.747,812. In particular, Ar is exemplified by substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, phenoxyphenyl, naphthyl or biphenyl groups, such as represented by 3 phenoxyphenyl, 2 fluoro l,1 biphenyl, 4 isobutylphenyl, 4 fluoro 4 biphenyl and 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl, and 4 chlorophenyl 5 benzoxyazoyl.

Other non interfering substituents can be present as well. The a hydroxy ketals are prepared from known or readily prepared a halo alkyl aryl ketones of the formulaEMI12.1 wherein Ar, R1 are as defined hereinbefore and X is halo, exemplified by bromo, chloro and iodo. methods of preparation of the a halo alkyl aryl ketones have been described previously in British Patent Application Serial No. 8005752, filed February 20, 1980, and published underNo. 2,042,543 on September 24, 1980. Methods of preparation of alkyl aryl ketone precursors of the a halo alkyl aryl ketones have been described in U.S. Patent No.4,135,051. Such alkyl aryl ketone precursors can be conventionally halogenated by methods known in the art, such as described in the above identified British PatentApplication Serial No. 8005752 and Reagents for OrganicSynthesis, p. 161 John Wiley Sons, Inc. 1967 . The a hydroxy ketals are prepared from the a halo alkyl aryl ketones of the above described formula by contacting an a halo alkyl aryl ketone with strong base in an alcoholic solvent medium. Such a method has been described previously in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 72, 4758 1950 . Conveniently, an a halo alkyl aryl ketone is contacted with an alkali metal salt of an aryloxide or alkoxide anion in the presence of an alcohol, such as an alkanol, to afford the desired a hydroxy ketals.The alkanols include the C1 C8 alkanols, especially theC1 C4 alkanols, and their branched chain isomers and are exemplified by methanol, ethanol, n propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, octanol and the branched chain isomers thereof. Other non interfering organic solvents such as benzene and toluene can be present as well. The alkali metals are exemplified by sodium, potassium and lithium. The aryloxide anions having 6 20 carbon atoms and alkoxide anions having 1 8 carbon atoms comprehended are exemplified by phenoxide, methoxide, ethoxide and the like. In the above described process, the a hydroxy ketal is formed in a one step process. The cyclic ketals can be prepared by contacting the a halo alkyl aryl ketones with a dianion of a dihydric alcohol, such as prepared from an alkali metal or alkali metal hydride and the dihydric alcohol.The dihydric alcohols include the C2 C8 alkanediols, such as ethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, 1,3 propylene glycol, the butanediols, pentanediols, hexanediols, heptanediols, octanediols and branched chain isomers thereof and the like. The cyclic ketals formed from the dihydric alcohols incorporate the corresponding alkylene radicals having 2 8 carbon atoms, preferably 2 6 carbon atoms, into their structure, such as exemplified by ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene, hexylene, heptylene, octylene and branched chain isomers thereof.Equivalently, the cyclic ketal or thioketal could be formed by exchange from the dialkoxy or diaryloxy ketals. For example, 2 bromo 1 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propanl one is treated with sodium methoxide in methanol to afford the a hydroxy ketal, l,l dimethoxy l 6 methoxy 2naphthyl propan 2 ol. The a hydroxy ketal or thioketal of the alkyl aryl ketone then is treated with an esterifying agent to form the corresponding ketal or thioketal ester substrate of a compound of the formulaEMI14.1 wherein Ar and R1 are as defined above and O Z is the anionic residue of an organic acid and is sufficiently labile to disassociate from the substrate upon contact with a protic or dipolar, aprotic solvent medium.Particularly suitable organic acids are those having electron deficient substituents such as exemplified by aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl sulfonic acids and substituted benzoic acids. Included among the group comprehended by alkyl above including straight and branched chain groups are those having 1 18 carbon atoms, especially 1 8 and most preferably 1 4 carbon atoms, as exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl, tert butyl, amyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl and octadecyl. Representative of the alkenyl groups are those having 2 8 carbon atoms such as vinyl, allyl, methallyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, heptenyl, octenyl and isomeric forms thereof. Typical of the alkynyl groups are those having 2 to 8 carbon atoms such as ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, pentynyl, hexynyl, heptynyl, octynyl and isomeric forms thereof.Representative of the cycloalkyl groups are those having 3 15 carbon atoms, especially 3 8 carbon atoms, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, l cyclohexenyl, methylcyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, cyclodecyl, cycloundecyl., cyclododecyl and cyclopentadecyl. The aryl and aralkyl groups include carbocyclic radicals having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms and are exemplified by tolyl, xylyl, benzyl, phenethyl, phenylpropyl, benzhydryl, naphthylmethyl, and the like, as well as fused and bridged ring structures, such indanyl, indenyl, naphthyl, acenaphthyl, phenanthryl, cyclopentanopolyhydrophenanthryl, adamantanyl, bicyclo 3 l l heptyl, bicyclo 2 2 2 octyl and the like. All of the above can either be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more non interfering substituents, typically 1 3 substituents, such as hydroxyl derivatives, for example, alkoxy, having 1 4 carbon atoms, such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, and the like acyloxy, having 2 4 carbon atoms, such as acetoxy, propionoxy, butyroxy and the like nitro groups alkylamino groups, having 2 8 carbon atoms, such as dimethylamino, diethylamino and the like halogens, such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine carbonyl derivatives such as enol ethers and ketals and the like. Presently preferred sulfonic acids are the alkylsulfonic acids having 1 4 carbon atoms such as methanesulfonic acid and the aryl and aralkyl sulfonic acids having 6 20 carbon atoms such as toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid and 8 styrenesulfonic acid. Various polymeric sulfonic acids such as polymeric alkyl and aryl sulfonic acids can also be utilized. Other organic acids having electron deficient substituents, the anions of which form sufficiently labile ester leaving groups which disassociate from the substrate upon contacting with a protic or dipolar, aprotic solvent medium could be used as well. The esterifying agent typically comprises the acid halide, such as the chloride, bromide, or iodide, of the described organic acids. The acid chlorides are presently preferred. The foregoing esterification of the a hydroxy alkyl aryl ketal or thioketal to the corresponding ester substrate is exemplified by the contacting of l,l dimethoxy l 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propan 2 ol with methanesulfonyl chloride in triethylamine to form the corresponding l,l dimethoxy 1 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl prop 2 yl methanesulfonate.The esterification step is conveniently conducted in organic bases such as pyridine, tertiary alkylamines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, lutidine, N methylmorpholine, N,N dimethylaniline, and the like or inert organic solvents, such as halogenated hydrocarbons e.g.methylene chloride , hexane, toluene, xylene and the like, containing an organic base of the type described. The resulting ester then is maintained in contact with a protic or dipolar, aprotic solvent for a time sufficient to form the a aryl alkanoic acid or the ester, ortho ester or amide thereof. The protic solvents comprehended include water, alcohols, ammonia, amides,N alkyl amides, carboxylic acids and mixtures thereof. Representative alcohols include C1 C10 primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols and C2 C6 polyhydric alcohols. They include alkanols, alkenols, cyclic alkanols, phenols, glycols, and the like. Examples of the alkanols comprehended are methanol, ethanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, octanol, and the branched chain isomers thereof. Examples of the alkenols are allyl alcohol, 2 buten l ol and the like. Cyclic alkanols are exemplified by cyclopropanol, cyclobutanol, cyclohexanol and the like. Examples of phenols are phenol, a naphthol, B naphthol, p cresol and the like.Representative amides are formamide, acetamide, propionamide, benzamide and the like. Typical of theN alkyl C2 C8 amides are N methylformamide andN ethylformamide. Typical of the carboxylic acids areC1 C10 alkanoic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, n butyric acid and the branched chain isomers thereof, C2 C10 alkenoic acids, such as acrylic acid, maleic acid and fumaric acid and the like, C6 C20 aryl acids such as benzoic acid, phthalic acid and isophthalic acid and the like, and diacids such as malonic, succinic, glutaric acid and the like. Dipolar, aprotic solvents are typified by dimethylsulfide, acetone, dioxan, carbon disulfide,C3 C18 dialkylamides such as dimethylacetamide and dimethylformamide, nitrobenzene, nitromethane, acetonitrile and the like and mixtures thereof. The rate of the rearrangement reaction appears to be enhanced by the presence of salts of organic or inorganic anions. For example, the addition of sodium acetate or sodium bicarbonate to the reaction mixture facilitates the reaction. Additionally, one can buffer the solvent medium to prevent hydrolysis of the ketal or thioketal prior to occurrence of the rearrangement. Typical buffering salts include the sodium, potassium and lithium salts of carbonate, bicarbonate, anions of organic acids and phosphates. The rearrangement of the above described ester substrate can be advantageously conducted in the absence of water e.g. Examples 3, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 28 thus minimizing the potential for hydrolysis of the ketal to the ketone when acid is present prior to the rearrangement of the ketal. Hyrolysis of the ketal to the ketone, if permitted, proceeds more rapidly than the rearrangement step and diminishes the yield of the desired, rearranged product. Since the rearrangement step can produce an acid when the O Z group disassociates from the substrate, the potential for hydrolysis of the ketal exists if water is present.However, if water is absent i.e. under substantially anhydrous conditions hyrolysis of the ketal to the ketone is substantially eliminated and high yields of the rearranged product are obtained, even under strongly acidic conditions. Under rearrangement conditions where water is present, the addition of base to neutralize the acid produced by the disassociation of the O Z group is desirable to prevent the aforementioned hydrolysis of the ketal. However, since the process of this invention can be utilized with optically active materials, as described below, racemization of the optically active material used or produced can occur under excessively basic conditions. Rearrangement under acidic conditions substantially avoids racemization problems with subsequent loss of optical purity in the product. Depending on the nature of the pro tic or dipolar aprotic solvent medium, the a arylalkanoic acid may not be directly formed. Instead, the ester, ortho ester or amide of the a arylalkanoic acid may be formed. For example, if the solvent medium contains water, an ester of the a arylalkanoic acid typically is formed wherein the ester group is derived from the ketal functionality or from the solvent. Mixed esters can be formed. Under anhydrous alcoholic conditions, ortho esters of the a arylalkanoic acid can be formed wherein the ester groups may be derived from the ketal functionality or from the solvent and may be mixed. Likewise, when an amine is present in the solvent medium, formation of an amide of the arylalkanoic acid can be expected.Those compounds typically are not isolated but are hydrolyzed directly to the desired a arylalkanoic acid. Depending on the reaction conditions, hydrolysis may be effected concommitantly or sequentially by standard methods. For example, when the protic solvent medium comprises acetic acid and sodium acetate and the ester substrate comprises 1, l dimethoxy l 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl prop 2 yl methanesulfonate, there is afforded the compound, methyl 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionate. The methyl ester is then sequentially hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid by contact with base. Alternatively, the a arylalkanoic acid can be obtained by concomitant hydrolysis by maintaining the ester substrate in contact with a methanol water solution containing sodium bicarbonate. Typically, l,l dimethoxy l 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl prop 2 yl methanesulfonate is maintained in contact with a methanol water solution containing sodium bicarbonate to afford 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid. The process of the present invention is advantageous in another aspect in that the a hydroxy ketal or thioketal can be resolved to afford the optically active enantiomers. The resolution can be effected by conventional methods for resolving alcohols which are well known in the art. Separation of the enantiomers and regeneration of the hydroxy substituent yields an optically active material which can subsequently be utilized in the process as hereinbefore described. As the rearrangement of the aryl group is considered to take place with inversion of configuration at the carbon atom attached to the dissociating ester group, the appropriate enantiomer is chosen to afford an a arylalkonic acid of the desired optical enrichment which is most advantageous pharmaçeutically, if one of the enantiomers of the acid product is pharmaceutically more active or advantageous than the other. For example, in the preparation of 2 6 methoxy2 naphthyl propionic acid, the S form i.e. d is desirable and the S form of the optically active a hydroxy ketal or thioketal would be considered an appropriate starting material. Alternatively, the racemic arylalkanoic acids produced hereby can be resolved by known methods to afford a desired optically active product. For example, racemic 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid can be resolved by methods described in U.S. Patents Nos.3,904,683, 4,246,164 and 4,246,193. Reaction times, temperatures and material ratios for conducting the process of this invention are not considered critical. However, it has been found convenient to conduct the ketalization step in the temperature range of between 100C and the refluxing temperature of the reaction mixture. Typical reaction times are between 0.5 to 10 hours. Suitable yields have been obtained by utilizing an excess of the alkali metal alkoxides and aryloxides, such as in the range of 1.1 2.5 equivalents. The esterification step is conveniently conducted between 10 C and the refluxing temperature of the reaction mixture and for times ranging between 0.5 5 hours. The esterification agent, i.e. the acid halide, typically is present in 0 50 molar excess and the organic base in 0 100 molar excess.The solvolysis step in the protic or dipolar, protic solvent medium is conducted typically in a temperature range between 50 2000C and for times ranging between 1 100 hours.Various combinations of times, temperatures and material ratios can be chosen by those skilled in the art to optimize the various process steps utilized and exemplified herein. The a aryl alkanoic acids prepared by the process of this invention can be converted by known methods to their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonia, calcium, magnesium, ferrous, zinc, manganous, aluminum, ferric, manganic salts and the like.Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as triethylamine, tripropylamine, 2 dimethylaminoethanol, 2 diethylaminoethanol, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, N ethylpiperidine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins and the like.
