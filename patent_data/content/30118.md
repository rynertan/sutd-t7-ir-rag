# A decoder circuit.

## Abstract
The decoder circuit has a power dissipation reduction transistor Qb connected in series with a NOR gate having transistors Q0 to On. Switching ON and OFF of transistor Qb is controlled by a first control signal o, e.g. a chip select signal. The NOR gate receives address signals A0 to An and supplies an output, dependent upon those signals, to a first inverter INV1 the output of which is supplied to a second inverter INV2, the output of which is connected to a word line WD of a memory circuit. Load transistor Q21 of INV2 receives a second control signal 1 which is delayed in phase from o. Transistors Q21 and Q22 of INV2 are of larger current capacity than transistors Qb and Q0 to Qn. Stray capacitance of word line WD can be charged and discharged rapidly through Q21 and Q22 whilst power dissi pation through the NOR gate when Qb is ON but address signals A0 to An take values which to not correspond to word line WD can be reduced.
