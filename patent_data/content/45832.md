# A control system for a variable displacement pump.

## Abstract
A control for a variable displacement pressure compen sated pump in which pressurized control fluid regulates the setting of a sequence valve to set the maximum output pressure of the pump and also set the displacement of the pump. The sequence valve is a two stage device which utilizes a sequence poppet stage 69,72 and cone stage 85,85 . When working fluid pressure exceeds the setting of the sequence valve, the cone stage 85,85 spills to reduce the displacement of the pump. If the pressure is not reduced fast enough the sequence poppet 69,72 spills to more rapidly reduce the displacement of the pump.
