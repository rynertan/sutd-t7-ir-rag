# SELF HEALING CAPACITORS

## Abstract
A wound capacitor comprises two insulating films 10 and 12 alternating with two electrodes. Each electrode comprises a metallized area 14, 16 leaving free margins m on the opposi tion edges of the insulating films respectively. Metal foils 18 and 20 overlie part of the widths of the metallized films extending in from opposite edges a little less than half the strip width. Accordingly there is no foil overlap and self healing can occur by metallized film vapourization. However the contact of the metal foil strips with nearly half of the metallized films, providing low resistance, substantially reduces displacement current heating in the metallized films. Heavy terminals are bonded to the metal foil edges at the ends of the roll.
