# Photographic print inspection method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Photographic prints and corresponding negatives in roll form are synchronously passed through inspection and pack aging stations 140 utilising magnetically stored printing histo ry data in a central computer system 18 . The inspection and packaging apparatus chops the prints and places each print in identifiable positions upon an inspection belt. The negative re lated history data can be correlated to identifiable locations in which corresponding prints are placed. By referring to a loca tion identifier, an inspector may select a print for reprinting and automatically have access to all history data for that negative. If an order has only acceptable prints, it is immediately packaged for shipment to the customer. For orders having unacceptable but correctible prints, the reprint data and corresponding neg atives are returned to a printer which automatically corrects the observed inacceptable prints. The corrected prints are then combined with the remaining prints in the order and re turned to the customer.
