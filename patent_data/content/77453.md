# Storage subsystems with arrangements for limiting data occupancy in caches thereof.

## Abstract
A storage hierarchy has a backing store 14 and a cache 15 . During a series of accesses to the hierarchy by a user 10 write commands are monitored and analysed. Writing data to the hierarchy results in data being selectively removed from the cache. Space in the cache not being allocated to data being written, results in such data being written to the backing store to the exclusion of the cache. Writing as part of a chain or sequential set of commands causes further removal of the data from the cache at the end of the chain or sequence. Removal of data increases the probability of writing data directly to the backing store with data readings from the cache.
