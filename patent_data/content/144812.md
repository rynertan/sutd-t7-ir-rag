## Description
The present invention relates to new butyrolactone deri vatives, to the preparation method thereof and to the pharmaceu tical compositions containing them. In particular, the invention relates to i alkylamino t buz tyrolactones and to the pharmaceutically acceptable salts there of, able to inhibit drinking of alcohol and intoxicating drinks. The derivatives of butyrolactone, which are one object of the present invention are comprised in the following general for mula I EMI1.1 wherein R is a linear or branhed alkyl radical containing from 3 to 5 Carbon atoms. It is known that an alcohol dependent subject, after he has ceased to ingest alcohol or intoxicating drinks, does not reach a complete detoxication by a few days sobriety .In fact it is deemed that several months of abstention from using alcohol are necessary before leading vital organs again to their rule. During the period following the suspension of ingesting alcohol, the therapy based on the use of drugs is often conside red useful to discourage a patient from drinking again intoxica ting drinks. The more generally used drug in the abstinence period is di sulfiram, which seems to act as a chelating agent able to chelateZn of the alooUlol dehydrogenase, Fe and Mo of the aldehyFo dehy drogenase, as well as Cu of the dopamine hydroylase. However, disulfiram shows serious disadvantages when it is administered in order to make a patient free from alcohol depen dence. In fact, because of its interaction with ethanol, within a few minutes after having ingested very low amounts of alcohol, pa tients treated with disulfiram show very particular side effect8. Patient begins to have a sensation of warmth in the face skin, and particularly in the upper part of the chest and face becomes red and he has a sensation of something lying heavy in his head and chest. Furthermore, this reaction can be accompanied also by difficulty in breathing, nausea, vomit, sudation, debility, diffi cult sight and confusion. Hitherto, the duration of the effect caused by a single dose of disulfiram is unknown generally, it is thought that the effect ends within 12 24 hours. High levels of alcohol associated with the administration of high levels of disulfiram can cause a very serious reaction, even able to risk the life of the patient.The reaction is generally in pro port ion to the quantity of alcohol ingested and to the disulfiram dose. Furthermore, disulfiram has in general a short effectiveness.For instance, a single dose of disulfiram may act only for 12 24 hours. Butyrolactones are compounds known from the literature.However, according to what described in the technical literature William E. Clunk et al. Science, 217 , 1040 1982 they have the remarkable disadvantage to be convulsant at doses depending on the treated subject and therefore, although they show a certain effect in making the patient undependent on alcohol, they cannot be used. ss Derivatives of i butyrolactone are also convulsant. It has been now surprisingly found, and this is an object of the present invent ion, that alkylamino butyro lactones compri sed in the general formula I , and particularly d n.butylamino butyrolactone which hereinafter will be indicated as PTT 1 for sake of brevity , are efficacious for treating alcohol dependence, and show some important advantages when compared with disulfiram, in that their mechanism of action is wholly different. In party cular a do not cause dangerous effects deriving from the association of the drug with alcohols, in particular with ethanol b their effectiveness lasts a long time c they are not convulsant. The compounds comprised in the general formula I , and in particular compound PTT 1, may be suitably administered by oral route or by i.m. or i.v. injection, according to the treated sub ject the administration by oral route is more suitable for humans, is more acceptable and therefore is preferred. Usually, the best level of PTT 1 for humans is about 1 g day, preferably divided in two administrations.After 3 days of treatment with PTT 1 the suppression of the aloof hol desire is reached and lasts for about 30 days. Another object of the present invention is the process for the preparation of compounds of the general formula I . The pre paration can be performed according two methods Method A the alkylhalide is allowed to react with the X amino butyrolactone, at low temperature and in the presence of a ter tiary organic base, such as for instance pyridine. Method B an halo butyrolactone, preferably an alpha chloro butyrolactone or N bromo butyrolactone is allowed to react with the selected alkylamine, under the same conditions described inMethod A . D0 Amino S butyrolactone is a known compound and it is availa ble on the market. It oan be prepared, for instance, according to the method described by J.E.Livak et al. J.Am.Chem. Soc. 67 2218, 1945 . A further object of the present invention are the pharmaceu tical compositions containing as active ingredient a compound of the general formula I t together with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The finished pharmaceutical forms suitable for the oral admix nistration can be capsules, tablets, pellets, granulated product. The following examples are intended for illustration of the present invention they are not intended to limit the invention in any way. Example 1Preparation of alpha n.butylamino butyrolactone Method A 1 mol of q amino t butyrolactone is mixed with more than 2 mols of pyridine. To the obtained mixture, cooled to 0 50C there is added 1 1.25 mol of n.butyl ohloride. The mixture is allowee to stand at about 00C for a time sufficient to complete the reaction. Thereafter, pyridine hjrdrochloride is filtered off and the remaining mixture is heated at room tempera ture. The mixture is concentrated by evaporation and thereafter it is cooled on ice alpha butylamino alpha butyrolactone crystallizes. Yield 85 on the theoretic. m.p. 62 63 C. Method B 1 mol of o bromo butyro lactone is mixed with more than 2 mols of pyridine and the obtained mixture, cooled to 0 30C, is added with 1 1.25 mol of n.butylamine.The reaction mixture is allowed to stand for a time sufficient to complete the reaction thereafter, pyridine hydrobromide is filtered off and the liquid is heated at room temperature. After con centration by evaporation, the solution is allowed to crystallize to afford alpha n.butylamino alpha butyrolactone. m.p. 62 63 C. Example 2Preparation of alpha pentylamino tbutyrolactone Method A 1 mol of alpha amino t butyrolactone is mixed with more than 2 mols of pyridine.The mixture is cooled to 0 50C and is added with 1 1.25 mol of n.pentylchloride. The mixture is allowed to stand at O C for a time sufficient to complete ths reaction. After having filtered the pyridine hydrochloride, the solution is heated at room tempe rature and is concentrated by evaporation. The concentrated solu tion is cooled on ice and allowed to crystallize to afford alpha n. pentylamino butyrolactone. m.p. 64 65 OC. Method B By working under the same conditions described for Method A , but replacing amino butyrolactone by 1 mol of alpha bromo butyro lactone and allowing it to react with n.pentylamine, the same com pound is obtained as by Method A , that is alpha n.pentylamine bu tyro lactone. Example 3 We star rats have been selected in order to test the effectiveness of the compounds of the invention to suppress the alcohol desire.After having administered by i.p. injection an anhestetic dose of 4.5 g kg of ethanol 25 solution , the sensitiveness of rats to the soporific effect of ethanol was tested. The beginning and the duration of the sleep period, indicated by the disappearance and recurrence of the righting reflex were recorded.Animals showing a shorter sleep period were placed into single caw ges and kept under a cyclic period 12 hours of light and dark. The same processes were applied to rats showing a longer sleep pe riod.An ethanol 15C,6 solution and water were administered in gradua ted bottles. The position of the bottles was irregularly chan ged to avoid the use of a certain position and to make sure that rats ingest from beginning both the available liquids. Ingestion of liquids has been recorded each day at the same hour.On ly the animals showing the shorter sleep period began to drink ethanol solution0 These animals, in fact, ingested 4.3 0.85 g kg day of ethanol after two weeks, whereas the animals showing the longer sleep period ingested only 0.75 0.13 g kgldsy. After 1 month exposure to alcohol and after having recorded sample values of alcohol ingestion, the animals showing the shorter sleep period were divided randomly in two groups. During three subsequent days, a group was given with alpha n.butylz amino butyrolactone at the level of 200 mg kg i.p., together with a pharmaceutically suitable vehicle, twice a day.Saline solution was injected to the group of controls.The verification of the ingestion of liquid and the verification of body weight was continued for further 5 days after the end of the injection period.The following table shows the average consumption of ethanol ex pressed as absolute amount of ethanol before, during and after the inject ion with alpha n.butylamino butyrolactone. Significant differences as to the ethanol consumption were not ob served in the group of controls on the contrary, in the group of the animals treated with alpha n.butylamino butyrolactone, and in dicated as test group, a complete suppression of the ingestion of ethanol was observed. The consumption of alcohol remained at low levels during 5 days after the injection. Concomitantly with the suppression of the voluntary ingestion of ethanol, neither si gnificant reduction of the total swallowing of liquid was observe ved nor of the body weight.The data reported in the following table show that the most part of the liquid ingested by rats daily, namely 15cox was ethanol so lution, corresponding to 4 5 g ethanol kg day.I.p. injection of PTT 1 at the dose of 200 mg kg day, for three days in succession, resulted in about 80 reduction of the etha nol ingestion during the treatment, but did not reduce the total ingestion of liquid. Ethanol ingestion was kept remarkably redu ced up to the fifth day after the interruption of the treatment.It has been observed that up to a 10 M concentration, P 2 1 did not inhibit eiether alcoholic dehydrogenase or the aldehydo dehy drogenase in rat homogenized liver, or the dopamine p hydroxyla se in rat homogenized medulloid parts of adrenal gland or of rat homogenized hypothalamus.
