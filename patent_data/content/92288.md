## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 6 substituted 1,1,3,3 tetramethyl 1 H 2,3 dihydro pyrrolo 3,4 c pyridine, of general formula EMI1.1 in which R can be an aryl containing up to 12 carbon atoms, CH2R where R is an aryl of up to 12 carbon atoms or CH2R where R is an alkyl or aralkyl containing up to 20 carbon atoms, including branched OH, NH2 including alkyl acyl substituted , CN or COORIV, whereRIV is alkyl containing up to 4 carbon atoms, consisting of reacting a tetramethyl substituted dipropargylamine with a nitrile, in an cccs of the nitrile, which is possibly also used as the solvent, at a temperature of between 50 and 1500C, in the presence of a catalyst prepared by the in situ reduction of CoCl2 with manganese or zinc dust, or by treating Raney cobalt with thiourea, It is known to prepare pyrrolopyridines unsubstituted in positions 1 and 3 from unsubstituted diacetylene compounds in the presence of special monovalent cobalt complexes, but this catalytic system has proved ineffective for substituted dipropargylamines.Moreover, unsubstituted dipropargylamine reacts with acetonitrile in the presence of cobalt carbonyl to gj.ve 6 methylated pyrrolopyridine only with a yield of 21.4 . Furtherr ore, in the presence of acetonitrile used as solvent and acetylene compounds, CoC12 En gives rise to the trimerisation of these latter but without any interaction with the acetonitrile Organometal Chem, Syn. 1, 185 1971 .It has therefore been surprinsing to find taht with the catalytic system proposed by the 1esent invention, it is possible to obtain very positive results from substrates having a structure very similar to those used in the known art.By carrying out the reaction under extremely moderate conditions, ie bringing the reagents into contact with the catalyst under agitation, preferably in an inert atmosphere, at a temperature of about 70 85 C, yields lath respect to the fed dipropargylamine have been obtained which always exceed 80. The products obtained con be separated from the reaction mixture in a simple manner by conventional methods, preferably by distillation or crysiallisation. The products obtained are new chemical products which can be used as intermediates for organic synthesis, both for the production of pyridine derivatives and of pyrrole derivatives in all their fields of application.By suitably varying the structure of the nitrile used, it is possible to obtain compounds which in position 6 contain the most suitable substituents for the use for which the product is intended.The present invention will be more apparent from the examples given hereinafter for illustrative purposes only.
