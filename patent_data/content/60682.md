# PROCESS FOR MAKING DIELECTRIC STENCILLED MICROCIRCUITS

## Abstract
A process for making complex, high density microcircuits in which thick film dielectric pastes 21 are photolithography patterned into high resolution stencils to produce complemen tary conductor circuitry patterns, the voids 25, 26 of the developed dielectric stencil are filled with thick film con ductor paste 27, 28 and then the resulting structure is fired in an air or nitrogen atmosphere. Thus the number of separate firing operations is reduced which is important in mul tilevel hybrid structures.
