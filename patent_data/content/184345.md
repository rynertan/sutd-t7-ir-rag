# Modular radial neutron reflector.

## Abstract
A neutron reflector assembly for the irregular space 13 in a nuclear reactor between an array 5 of elongated rectilinear, fuel assemblies 3 through which reactor coolant is circulated and a cylindrical core barrel 7 surrounding the array, consists of a plurality of modules 15 each including an elongated strongback 21 and a plurality of elongated plates 23 jointed along their longitudinal edges to form an elongated enclosure 17 having neutron reflectors disposed therein for insertion into the irregular space 13 between the fuel assembly array 5 and the cylindrical core barrel 7 .
