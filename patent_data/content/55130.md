# Improvements in or relating to selective plating.

## Abstract
An apparatus for use in selective plating a component, particularly a strip component 3 , which apparatus com prises a series of movable selective plating heads in an endless chain configuration, each plating head comprising an electrolyte opening 15 , means 22 for indexing the plating head to a strip, means 16 for engaging the strip so as to expose, in use, the area to be selectively plated to electrolyte, means 17, 18 for releasably sealing the rear of the strip in the region of the area to be plated, means 19 for fastening the sealing means prior to the entry of the plating head into the electroplating zone and means for releasing the sealing means after the plating head leaves the electro plating zone, resilient or slidable couplings being provided between the plating heads so that the plating head can index to the strip to be plated, and means 12 for supplying electrolyte to the area to be selectively plated.
