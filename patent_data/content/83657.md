# MOLD AND STRUCTURE OF VENT PART THEREOF.

## Abstract
Mold used for a die casting. It is necessary to provide a vent for exhausting the gas in a cavity of the mold of this type when the cavity is filled with molten metal. This mold advantageously has a vent part formed of oblique slots 5,5,...and 6,6,... inclined in opposite directions to one another and communicating with the cavity 3 and a safety cavity 7 on the confronting surfaces of the two half molds 1,2 forming the cavity 3 , thereby effectively exhausting the gas without spouting molten metal.
