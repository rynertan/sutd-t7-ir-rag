## Description
The present invention relates to a bill handling apparatus, such as an automated teller machine ATM , operated by a user to complete transactions. More particularly, the present invention relates to a bill handling apparatus of the recycle type in which received bills are arranged so that the front and back sides face the same direction and in which the mechanisms are simplified. Automated teller machines ATM are now widely used in banks and the like as a part of computer banking systems. In an ATM, a credit card card or a bank book are ordinarily used to effect disbursement of cash and acceptance of deposits. The convenience of ATM s has led to their increasing use. US A 4 166 945 discloses an ATM which both accepts and disburses bills, genuine bills inserted by users being received in a box or safe while bills to be disbursed are delivered from separate cassettes. Conventional ATM s, however, have the disadvantage that when a bill receiving box becomes full, it is necessary to take out the bills from the box or exchange the box with an empty one. For this purpose, the ATM must temporarily be stopped. On the other hand, in the case of disbursement, when bills set in the cash dispenser have been exhausted, a new supply of bills must be provided. The ATM must also be stopped for this purpose. Temporary stoppage is not preferred for an ATM as it detracts from customer service. Accordingly, temporary stoppage should be avoided to the utmost. Furthermore, the receiving box sometimes becomes full with bills, while the cash dispenser becomes empty, resulting in ineffective utilization of bills. Recently, a recycle type ATM has been developed to eliminate the above mentioned disadvantages. This ATM arranges and stores accepted bills according to denomination and uses them for disbursement. This increases the utilization efficiency of bills, minimizes stoppage of the ATM, and facilitates control of the apparatus. Such a recycle type ATM is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 56 92691. In this ATM bills received from a bill insertion opening are passed via a discriminating means to a bill arranging means from which, if rejected, they are passed singly to a bill disbursing opening or, if accepted, are passed to the top of respective bill receiving boxes, from the bottom of which bills can subsequently be delivered to the bill disbursing opening as required for disbursement. The present invention provides an improved bill handling apparatus of the recycle type having the combination of features set forth in claim 1. In particular it provides a recycle type of bill handling apparatus which functions to arrange bills deposited so that the front and back sides face the same direction, and temporarily accumulate the arranged bills pending the user s acceptance or refusal of the deposit, and such an apparatus which uses a single unit for the discrimination of both deposited bills and bills to be disbursed. The present invention will now be described in detail based on preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein In Fig. 1, on the right side of the upper portion of the front face of the apparatus, there is formed a card insertion opening 1, and on the left side, a bankbook insertion opening 2. In a panel located below these openings 1 and 2, a display 5 and a keyboard 4 are arranged on the right side and a bill insertion opening 6 and a bill disbursing opening 3 are arranged on the left side. Referring to Fig. 2, a bill delivery unit 26 has a function of delivering bills 10 inserted in the bill insertion opening 6 one by one. A shutter not shown is arranged in the bill insertion opening 6 so that the shutter is opened when bills 10 are inserted in the opening 6. A discriminating unit 8a discriminates genuineness, denomination, side, and condition of the bills 10. A bill arranging and pooling unit 22 arranges the discriminated bills 10 so that the front and back sides of the bill face the same directions and pools them. This unit 22 comprises a delivery unit 22a for delivering the bills 10 one by one. Bill receiving boxes 24a through 24c are adapted for receiving and storing the bills 10 according to denomination. Above these boxes, receiving and delivery units 25a through 25c are disposed, respectively. A reject box 23 is adapted for recovering bills 10 when judged damaged or not of the desired denomination in the discriminating unit 8a, when erroneous double feeding of bills from, for example, the delivery unit 22a takes place, when an erroneous number of bills are fed by the receiving and delivery units 25a, 25b, or 25c, or when the bills disbursed through the disbursing opening 3 are left behind by mistake. Feed rollers for moving bills 10, sensors S1 through S24 for sensing the presence and passage of bills 10, gates G1 through G9, and guide 271 are arranged in the respective passages, branching points, and joining point 27. A disbursing unit 28 is arranged to accumulate bills 10 to be disbursed and spurious bills to be returned. When the numbers of bills 10 stored in the receiving boxes 24a through 24c become excessively larger or smaller than the predetermined number, a detecting means not shown is actuated to give an alarm. If bills are excessively stored, some of them are recovered in the reject box 23. When the number of stored bills is too small, bills 10 are inserted in the delivery unit 22a through an inlet 19a arranged on the back side of the apparatus in a direction indicated by arrow T to effect supplementation of bills. Figure 9 is a block diagram of the control unit 18. A discrimination control 181 controls the discrimination of genuineness, denomination, side, and condition of bills 10 by the discriminating unit 8a and supplies results of the discrimination to a control unit 18. A sensor amplifier 182 amplifies detection signals produced by detection of bills 10 by sensors S1 through S24 comprising a photodiode 186 and a phototransistor 187 and feeds the amplified signals to the control unit 18. A magnet drive 183 gives a driving signal to a corresponding gate magnet GM according to a selection signal from the control unit 18 to control exchange among gates G1 through G9. A motor M1 is used for delivering out bills 10, a motor M2 is used for driving a one way rotating roller, a motor M3 is used for driving a roller capable of rotating in the normal and reverse directions, and motors M4 and M5 are used for driving a moving mechanism. Reference numeral 184 represents a motor drive. A clutch magnet drive 185 receives a signal from the control unit 18 and actuates the motor M1 to operate clutches C1 through C5 to intermittently rotate a pick roller, described hereinafter. The units and functions in the embodiment shown in Fig. 2 will now be described. As shown in Fig. 3, the delivery unit 26 comprises pick roller R1 and feed roller R2 arranged in the upper and lower portions, respectively. The pick roller R1 is connected to the motor M1 through the clutch C1. A pressing member 261 confronting the pick roller R1 and feed roller R2 with certain distances therefrom is rotatably supported on a shaft 261. The shaft 262 is attached to an L shaped guide frame 263. The guide frame 263 is gripped by guide rollers R3 through R5 and urged in a direction of arrow A by springs 264 attached on both the left and right ends, so that the distance of the pick roller R1 and feed roller R2 from the pressing member is broadened or narrowed by the driving or restoration of a retreat mechanism not shown . A delivery guide plate 265 is arranged below the feed roller R2 and guide frame 263 in the vicinity thereof, and a separate roller R6 rotating in the reverse direction is disposed below the delivery guide plate 265 to prevent double feeding. An accelerating roller R7 is arranged to have a rolling contact with the feed roller R2. A clearance allowing the passage of a bill 10 is set between the feed roller R2 and the feeding guide plate 265. A sensor S1 is disposed for detecting the insertion of bills 10 in a bill receiving zone defined by the pressing member 261 and the rollers R1 and R2. A sensor S2 is arranged at the outlet of the delivery unit 26 to detect the passage of a bill 10. When the insertion of bills is detected by the sensor S1, a shutter not shown of the insertion opening 6 is closed. When the insertion of bills 10 in the receiving zone defined by the pick roller R1, feed roller R2, and pressing member 261 is detected, the distance between the rollers R1 and R2 and the pressing member 261 is narrowed by restoration of the retreat mechanism. Accordingly, when the bills 10 are gripped by the surfaces of the pick roller R1, feed roller R2, and pressing member 261 by driving of the pick roller R1, feed roller R2, and separate roller R6, the bills 10 are delivered out one by one to a route indicated by arrow B while being guided by the delivery guide plate 265. Referring to Fig. 4 illustrating the discriminating unit 8a and neighboring passages for bills 10, in the interior of the discriminating unit 8a, feed rollers 9 and 10 capable of rotating in the normal and reverse directions are arranged to confront magnetic read heads H1 and H2 and deliver bills 10 while gripping them therebetween. On the left side, in Fig. 7, of the discriminating unit 8a, a gate G1 and a roller R8 capable of rotating in the normal and reverse directions are arranged above the crossing point between the transport passage of the route B for inserted bills 10 and the transport passage of the route F for bills 10 transported from the right side in Fig. 7 through the discriminating unit 8a. A gate G5 and feed rollers R13 through R15 are arranged on the lower side of the passages and below the passages. On the right side of the discriminating unit 8a, a gate G2, a feed roller R11 capable of rotating in the normal and reverse directions, and one way rotating, feed rollers R16 and R17 are arranged on the lower side of the passages and below the passages, while a gate G3 and a feed roller R12 capable of rotating in the normal and reverse directions are arranged on the upper side of the passages. The one way rotating feed roller R17 is connected to the motor M2, and the feed roller R8 capable of rotating in the normal and reverse directions is connected to the motor M3. The feed rollers R9 through R12 capable of rotating in the normal and reverse directions are driven by the feed roller R8, and the one way rotating feed rollers R13 through R16 are driven by the feed roller R17. The feed rollers R8 and R12 are rotated in a direction reverse to the rotation direction of the rollers R9 through R11. Namely, each feed roller is rotated in the direction for delivery of bills 10. Sensors S3, S4, S11, and S23 for detecting the passage of bills 10 are arranged between the feed rollers R11 and R16, at the entrance to the route G from the feed roller R12, in the branched passage through the feed roller R14 and gate G5 and between the feed rollers R13 and R14. The gate G1 is located at the upper position when bills 10 are in the normal state. It is brought down to the lower position while bills 10 are stored. The gate G2 is located at the lower position when bills 10 are in the normal state, but it is raised to the upper position when a bill 10 is returned as the result of discrimination. The gate G3 is located at the upper position in the normal state and brought down to the lower position at the time of disbursement. The gate G5 is located at the lower position in the normal state, but it is raised to the upper position at the time of storing and rejecting. Accordingly, by reading and detecting signals of the magnetic heads H1 and H2 and sensors S3, S4, S11, and S23, the motors M1 and M2 are driven to actuate the gates G2, G3, and G5 to deliver bills 10 along predetermined delivery passages, as described in detail hereinafter. In the bill arranging and pooling unit 22, as shown in Fig. 5, the feed rollers R18, R19, and R20 are arranged in the upper portion. The feed roller R19 has a rolling contact with the feed roller R20. A gate G4 is disposed below the feed rollers R19 and R20 in close proximity thereto. In the normal state, the gate G4 is tilted to the right in Fig. 5. When the back side of the bill 10 is detected by the discriminating unit 8a, the gate G4 is turned to the left by instructions of the control unit 18. A top plate 221 is arranged below the gate G4 and an accumulating plate 223 is arranged below the top plate 221. A presser 222 indicated by a two dot chain line in Fig. 5 is attached to the top plate 221. When the top plate 221 is located at the position shown in Fig. 5, the presser 222 is retreated above the top plate 221. When the top plate 221 is brought down, the presser 222 is exposed below the top plate 221. The accumulating plate 223 is rotatably supported on a supporting member 224 through a shaft 225 at the point A spring 226 is arranged on the left end of the supporting member 224 so that the supporting member 224 is hung and pulled from above. The left end of the supporting member 224 is engaged with a stopper 227. The top plate 221 and accumulating plate 223 are independently moved in the vertical direction by a driving mechanism not shown . This driving mechanism is connected to the motor M4. When the top plate 221 is brought down, the accumulating plate 223 is pressed by the presser 222 and brought down together with the top plate 221. A stopper 228 is arranged above the stopper 227 and is retreated in a direction of arrow S by a plunger magnet not shown . A butting plate 229 is vertically arranged on the left side of the accumulating plate 223. Feed rollers R21 and R22 and feed rollers R23 through R25 are arranged on the left and right sides of the top plate 221 and accumulating plate 223, respectively. The feed roller R21 has rolling contact with the feed roller R22, and the feed roller R24 has a rolling contact with the feed roller R25. A pulley P1 is arranged coaxially with the feed roller R22, and a ring belt 27a having a diameter larger than that of the pulley P1 is hung on the pulley P1. A pulley P2 is arranged coaxially with the feed roller R24 and a ring belt 27b having a diameter larger than that of the pulley P2 is hung on the pulley P2. The feed roller R19 is connected to the motor M2 and other feed rollers are driven by the feed roller R19. A delivery unit 22a for delivering out bills 10 is arranged below the accumulating plate 223. The delivery unit 22a is constructed by a pick roller R26, a feed roller R27, a separate roller R28 arranged to confront the feed roller R27 with a certain distance therefrom for preventing double feeding of bills 10, and an accelerating roller R29 having a rolling contact with the feed roller R27. The pick roller R26 is connected through the clutch C2 to the motor M1. A stopper 230 is arranged below the right end portion of the accumulating plate 223, and an upper roller R30 and a lower roller R31 are arranged separately from each other in the vertical direction. The upper roller R30 is rotatably attached to the top end of a lever 232 moving with a shaft 231 as the fulcrum, and the rear end of the lever 232 is connected to a plunger magnet 233. The lower roller R31 is connected to the motor M2. In the lower portion, in Fig. 5, of the feed roller R18, that is, in the end portion of the route G, a sensor S5 is arranged to detect the passage of bills 10. Furthermore, sensors S6 and S7 are arranged in the routes H and I, and sensors S8 and S9 are arranged above the intermediate point between the pick roller R26 and the feed roller R27 in front of the feed roller R27 and the accelerating roller R6 below the rollers R27 and R6, to detect the passage and presence of bills 10. Moreover, a sensor S10 is arranged substantially on the center line between the upper roller R30 and lower roller R31. When the sensor S10 detects the presence of a bill 10, the plunger magnet 231 is actuated to bring down the upper rolelr R30 and grip the bill 10 between the upper roller R30 and lower roller R31. On the back face of the apparatus, the inlet 19a is formed on a door 19 in the right portion in Fig. 5, and supplementary bills 10 can be inserted along an arrow T. Bills 10 which have been judged as being genuine by the discriminating unit 8a and have been transported along the route G are fed from the feed roller R18 to the feed rollers R19 and R20. Since the gate G4 is located on the right side, bills 10 judged as being front are advanced in the direction of arrow H, introduced into the accumulating part of the bill arranging and pooling unit 22 by the feed rollers R21 and R22, pressed by the rotation of the ring belt 27a in the direction indicated by the arrow and accumulated as shown in Fig. 5. When bills 10 are judged as being back , the gate G4 is shifted to the left, and the bills 10 are advanced in the direction of arrow I and pressed through the feed roller R23. The moving direction is changed by the feed rollers R24 and R25 to turn the bills 10 over, and the bills 10 are introduced into the accumulating part. At this point, the rear ends of the bills 10 are lifted up onto the ring belt 27b by the rotation of the ring belt 27b in the direction of the arrow, and the bills are placed below already accumulated bills 10 in the tilting posture. Since the ring belts 27a and 27b are always rotated, the delivered bills 10 are accumulated in the state where the front and back sides of the bills 10 are made to face the same directions and the bills 10 are brought in contact with the ring belts 27a and 27b. While accumulation is thus repeated, the accumulating plate 223 is brought down against the elastic force of the spring 226 according to the accumulated bills 10. Therefore, the bills 10 can be accumulated in the state where the front and back sides of the bills 10 face the same directions. When accumulation of bills 10 for one transaction is completed, the upper plate 221 is brought down and the presser 222 is further brought down while pressing the bills 10 on the accumulating plate 223. At this point, the right end, in Fig. 5, of the accumulating plate 223 falls in engagement with the stopper 230 and the accumulating plate 223 is tilted to the left with the shaft 225 as the fulcrum and is stopped. Accordingly, it is now possible to deliver out bills 10 by the pick roller R26 and feed roller R27, that is, the delivery unit 22a. At the time of supplementation of bills 10, on receipt of bill supplying instructions, the upper plate 221 is brought down and stopped by the stopper 228, while the accumulating plate 223 is brought down and stopped at the delivery position. If a predetermined number of bills 10 to be supplied are inserted through the inlet 19a, the sensor S10 detects the insertion and actuates the upper and lower rollers R30 and R31 to grip the bills 10 therebetween, and the bills 10 are fed onto the accumulating plate 223. When the passage of the rear ends of the bills 10 through the position of the sensor S10 is detected, the stopper 228 is retreated in the direction of arrow S. The upper plate 221 is further brought down and the presser 222 presses the bills 10. The pick roller R26 and feed roller R27 are driven to deliver out the bills 10, and the bills 10 are supplementarily stored into the receiving box 24a, 24b, or 24c of the desired denomination. The passage for bills 10 delivered out from the delivery unit 22a and the passage for bills 10 to be disbursed join at the joint portion 27. As shown in Fig. 6, at the crossing point where the routes J and Q join to form a route K, a guide 271 capable of swinging by gravity is supported on a support 272. In front of the guide 271, that is, in the left portion of Fig. 6, feed rollers R32 and R33 are arranged so that they have a rolling contact with each other with the transport passage interposed therebetween. The feed roller R32 is connected to the motor M2. Accordingly, the bills 10 transported along the route J are guided by the guide 271 and fed into the route K by the feed rollers R32 and R33, while the bills 10 transported along the route Q press up the guide 271 and pass through the guide 271 and are similarly fed into the route K by the feed rollers R32 and R33. The receiving and delivery units 25a through 25c will now be described in detail. One 24a of the receiving boxes 24a through 24c for the respective denominations is shown in Fig. 7. The receiving and delivery unit 25a is formed above the receiving box 24a, and a receiving mechanism 251 for feeding bills 10 into the box 24a is arranged on the right side. A delivery mechanism 252 for delivering out bills 10 from the box 24a is arranged on the left side. The receiving mechanism 251 comprises feed rollers R34 and R35, a pulley P3 coaxial with the feed roller R34, and a ring belt 27c. The ring belt 27c has a diameter larger than that of the pulley P3 and is hung on the pulley P3, and the feed rollers R34 and R36 have a rolling contact with the feed roller R35. A changeover gate G7 gate G8 or G9 for the receiving box 24b or 24c is arranged to feed bills 10 into the receiving mechanism 251, and a sensor S14 sensor S16 or S18 for the receiving box 24b or 24c is arranged at the rear i.e., on the left side as seen in Fig. 7 of the feed rollers R34 and R35. The delivery mechanism 252 comprises a pick roller R37 for delivering out bills 10, a feed roller R38, and a separate roller R39 for preventing double feeding of bills 10. The separate roller R39 confronts the feed roller R38 with a certain distance therefrom and is rotated in a direction reverse to the rotation direction of the feed roller R38. A feed roller R40 is arranged to have a rolling contact with the feed roller R38 so that bills 10 are delivered out from the deliver mechanism 252. The pick roller R37 is connected to the motor M1 through the clutch C3 clutch C4 or C5 for the receiving box 24b or 24c . A sensor S19 sensor S20 or S21 for the receiving box 24b or 24c is arranged in front i.e., on the left side as seen in Fig. 7 of the pick roller R37. An upper plate 241 is arranged above the receiving box 24a. A bill guide 242 is arranged on the inner side of the receiving box 24a, and bills 10 are received in the bill guide 242. Bills 10 are held on an accumulating plate 244 urged upward in Fig. 7 by a spring 243 arranged along the outer side of the bill guide 242 and are pressed upward by a pressing force P. The bill guide 242 is connected to the motor M5 through a transmission mechanism not shown and the bill guide 242 is driven by the motor M5 and moved in the vertical direction together with the accumulating plate 244. When bills 10 are received, the bills 10 guided to the position of the receiving box 24a along the route K are deviated from the route K by the changeover gate G7, fed by the feed rollers R35 and R36 and introduced into the receiving box 24a by the feed roller R34. Since the ring belt 27c hung on the pulley P3 is rotated in the direction indicated by the arrow, it exerts a function of pressing down the rear ends of the bills 10 and the bills 10 are stably received. When bills 10 are delivered out, the bill guide 242 of the receiving box 24a is moved upward together with the accumulating plate 244 to contact the bills 10 by a predetermined pressing force with the pick roller R37 and feed roller R38 rotated intermittently, whereby the bills 10 are delivered out in the rotation direction of the feed roller R38. The delivered bills 10 are fed to the route M by the feed rollers R38 and R40, and as described hereinbefore, the bills 10 are fed to the disbursing unit 28 of the bill disbursing opening 3 through the routes Q and K. In the disbursing unit 28 for accumulating bills 10 at the bill disbursing opening 3, as shown in Fig. 8, tooth roller R41 and roller R42 are arranged on the rear end of the route F for delivering bills 10, so that they have a rolling contact with each other. The tooth roller R41 is connected to the motor M2. An accumulating zone 281 for arranging bills 10 above the tooth roller R41 is defined by left and right side walls 282 and 283 and a bottom portion 284. The left corner, in Fig. 8, of the bottom portion 284 is opened and a sensor S17 is arranged below the bottom portion 284. Bills 10 fed along the transport passage of the route F are guided to the accumulating zone 281 by the tooth roller R41 and roller R42. Since the lower ends of the bills 10 are hit by the teeth of the tooth roller R41, they are accumulated in the state aligned along the surface of the side wall 283. The receiving and disbursing operations of the apparatus having the above mentioned structure and functions will now be described. Referring to Figs. 10A through 10D, when a user customer or teller depresses a deposit key of the keyboard 4, the shutter in the bill insertion opening 6 is opened. When bills 10 are inserted in the bill insertion opening 6 according to the guide displayed on the display 5, the sensor S1 detects the bills 10 to close the shutter and drive the motor M3. Then, the motor M3 is driven and rotated in the same direction, that is, to the right in Fig. 4, to effect changeover of the gate G1, whereby the motor M1 is driven to actuate the clutch C1 and the pick roller R1 and feed roller R2 are driven to deliver the bills 10. When the sensor S2 detects the delivered bills 10, the clutch C1 is disconnected. If the sensor S1 does not detect bills 10 any more, delivery is stopped. If bills are still detected by the sensor S1, the clutch C1 is actuated again without detection by the sensor S2 to conduct delivery. The delivered bills 10 are advanced in the direction of arrow shown in Fig. 2 along the route B and discrimination of the genuineness, denomination, and side is effected in the discriminating unit 8a. When a bill 10 is judged as being spurious, the gate G2 is changed over, and the bill 10 is advanced along the routes E and F and detected by the sensors S3 and S23. The passage through the gates G2 and G5 and the introduction into the accumulating zone 281 are confirmed by the sensor S24 and the spurious bill 10 is accumulated in the disbursing unit 28. When no detection is made by the sensor S1, the shutter in the disbursing opening 3 is opened, and the spurious bill 10 is returned and taken out by the user. When a bill 10 is judged as being genuine in the discriminating unit 8a, the gate G3 is changed over, and the bill 10 is fed along the route G and detected by the sensor S5. When the front side is out, the bill 10 is advanced in the route H and detected by the sensor S6 and is then accumulated after confirmation of the passage through the gate G4. When the back side is out, the gate G4 is changed over, and the bill 10 is advanced along the route I and detected by the sensor S7. After confirmation of the passage through the gate G4, the bill 10 is turned over and is then accumulated. After bills 10 of one transaction are thus accumulated, the transaction amount is shown on the display 5. When the user confirms the amount and depresses the confirmation button, the motor M4 is driven to bring down the accumulating plate 223, in the state where the presence of bills 10 is detected by the sensor S8, the motor M2 is driven, and the motor M3 is rotated in the reverse direction, that is, to the left in the drawings. Then, the motor M1 is rotated and the pick roller R26 and feed roller R27 are rotated by the clutch C2 to deliver out the bills 10. When the delivery of the bills 10 is detected by the sensor S9, the clutch C2 is disconnected. If no bill is detected by the sensor S8 any more, the delivery is completed. If bills 10 are further detected by the sensor S8, the clutch C2 is actuated again without detection by the sensor S9 to conduct the delivery. The delivered bills 10 are advanced along the route J and then along the route K and then advanced through the discriminating unit 8a in the direction of arrow D. The denomination and condition are then discriminated. The gate G5 is changed over, the bills 10 are advanced along the route L, and the passage is confirmed by the sensor S11. If a damaged condition is detected or if the discrimination cannot be effected due to double feeding or the like, the gate 6 is changed over, the bill is advanced along the route N, the passage is confirmed by the sensor S12, and the bill is recovered in the reject box 23. Faultless bills 10 whose denomination have been discriminated are advanced along the route M. The gates G7 through G9 are changed over according to the discriminated denomination, the passage through the gates G7 through G9 and the receipt of the bills 10 are confirmed and detected by the sensors S13 through S18, and the bills 10 are received in the receiving boxes 24a through 24c. On the other hand, after the transaction amount is displayed, and when the user depresses the deposition stopping key, the gate G5 is changed over. The bills 10 are transported along the route F, accumulated in the disbursing unit 28, and returned to the user. In the case of supplying supplementary bills into the receiving boxes 24a through 24c, a predetermined number of bills are inserted through the inlet opening 19a as indicated by a dot line arrow in Fig. 10C. The insertion is detected by the sensor S10 to actuate the plunger magnet 223 to grip the bills 10 between the upper and lower rollers R31 and R32. The motor M4 is driven to bring down the accumulating plate 223. The motor M2 is driven to feed the bills 10 into the delivery unit 22a. The bills 10 are detected by the sensor S8, delivered in the same manner as described above with reference to the receiving operation, and received in any of the receiving boxes 24a through 24c according to denomination. At the time of disbursement, as shown in Figs. 11A and 11B, when the user keys an amount of money and depresses the confirmation button, the numbers of bills 10 of the respective denominations are set and are indicated on a counter not shown in the control unit 18. The motors M2 and M3 are rotated. The motor M1 is then rotated to actuate the clutch C3 to rotate the pick roller R37 and feed roller R38. At this point, the motor M5 is driven to raise the bill guide 242 of the receiving box 24a, and the bills 10 are pressed by the pick roller R37 and feed roller R38 and are delivered out. When the denomination of delivered bills 10 from the receiving box 24a is correct, the delivery of the bills 10 is confirmed by the sensor S19, and the clutch C3 is disconnected. If no number is left on the counter, the delivery is completed. If any number is left on the counter, the clutch C3 is actuated again without detection by the sensor S19 to continue the delivery. On termination of the delivery, bills 10 of the denomination corresponding to the receiving boxes 24b and 24c are delivered out in succession in the same manner as described above. The delivered bills 10 are fed to the discriminating unit 8a through the routes M, Q and K. The discrimination of the denomination and the condition is effected in the discriminating unit 8a. In case of damaged condition, double feeding, or excessive delivery, the gates G5 and G6 are changed over, bills are advanced through the routes L and N, the passage is confirmed by the sensors S11 and S12, and the bills are recovered in the reject box 23. The reject box 23 has two compartments 23a and 23b, one of which, for example 23a, is used for recovering damaged bills, and the other of which, 23b, is used for the bills which are not discriminated in the discriminating unit and the excessively delivered bills. The changeover of the paths for access of bill to the compartments 23a and 23b is performed by changeover gate GR, which is controlled by the control unit 18. When bills are judged as being faultless and of the intended denominations in the discriminating unit 8a, the passage through the gate G is detected and confirmed by the sensor S23, the bills are advanced along the route F, the passage is detected by the sensor S24, and the bills are accumulated in the disbursing unit 28. When disbursement is completed, the shutter in the disbursing opening 3 is opened and the bills 10 are taken out by the user. If the bills are left behind by mistake, the bills are recovered into the compartment 23b of the reject box 23. As is apparent from the foregoing description, the apparatus of the present invention is provided with a mechanism for making the front and back sides of the deposited bills face the same direction. Therefore, the deposited bills are received in the state where the front and back sides face the same direction. As these arranged bills are used for the disbursement, customer service is improved. Moreover, even if the depositing transaction is stopped, bills can be returned in the state where the front and back sides of the bills 10 face the same direction. Furthermore, a single discriminating unit is used for both the acceptance of deposit and the disbursement. Accordingly, the discriminating unit and transport passages can be simplified and the number of parts and members can be reduced, and therefore, another effect of reducing the manufacturing cost can be attained.
