## Description
COLLFX TOR OF SOLAR ENERGY, HAVING A CONTINUOUS SURFACE, , CONSTRUCTIQN PROCESS AND USE THEREOF IN AIR CONDITIONING PLANTS o o o o The use of solar energy collectors, apt to pick up sun radiation more or less efficiently and turn it into sensitive heat of a working fluid usually water , is now of common knowledge. In most cases, such collectors make use of a collecting surface with low reflectivity, wherein a series of void channels for the passage of the working fluid are obtained, said surface being covered by a transparent surface apt to create a sealed space, which produces a greenhouse effect allowing to overheat the collecting surface above room temperature. The solar energy collectors of the type described above have a great number of drawbacks, which have up to date limited their possibilities and diffusion. In the first place, from a functional point of view, the plants connected thereto store energy under form of sensitive heat of the working fluid, and thus do not have the possibility to store large quantities of energy, unless resorting to huge deposits of heated fluid, with the problems of bulk and dispersion deriving therefrom.This has so far limited the use of solar collectors to the hot water production field, and the field of room conditioning has been dealt with only at an experimental level and merely for the new buildings provided with widely extended collecting surfaces0 In any case, the temperature of the working fluid is very changeable, as it is tied to the daily behaviour of the sun and, even more, to the seasonal course, and it prevents the utilization of other types of heat which require a more constant temperature, as for example the production of electric energy. In the second place, from a structural point of view, the construction of these collectors involves considerable costs, both for the materials employed and for the technology required to realize the single panels. In fact, these panels also because, as said, they have to be provided with a sealed space between the collecting surface and the transparent surface, so as to prevent any possable condensate on this latter may only be constructed in rather complex and very costly plants. Furthermore, the finished panel is particularly fragile, quite heavy and very difficult to install, especially when it requires to be inserted into surfaces designed for coverages which have to fully preserve their characteristics of impermeability. It finally occupies an area which cannot be otherwise utilized, as the panel is neither capable of supporting any load, nor can it be soiled in any way. It should be noted at last that due to the different stresses to which they are subjected meteorologic, thermal, mechanical, from pollution, and the like the materials forming the panels are Cx posed to exceptional wear. In particular, the transparent surface often undergoes a very fast time decay of its characteristics, resulting into a positive reduction of the radiation transmitted to the underlying collecting surface. The object of the present invention is therefore to supply an improved collector of thermal energy, and particularly of solar energy, of reduced cost and the construction of which can easily be carried out directly at the building yard, which is apt to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks. In particular, it eliminates the requirement to create a greenhouse effect and thus the need for a transparent coverage. A further object of the present invention is to supply an airconditioning plant using said collector, apt to overcome the limitations of thermal energy storage capacity, now existing in the plants which utilize the known type collectors. These results are obtained, according to the present invention, by means of a collector of thermal energy, and particularly of solar energy, characterized in that it comprises a composite layer structure, obtained by laying the single layers directly on the site of use and being formed starting from the side facing the source of energy of a first layer of elastomeric material, with high surface roughness and waterproof, having very low radiation and reflectivity, high elastic strain and capability to stand mechanical stresses without tearing a second layer of concrete with additives, having high thermal conductivity, into which is buried a system of tubes through which flows a heat exchange fluid a third layer of material with high reflectivity a fourth layer of material with high thermal insulation. According to a first characteristic of the present invention, said first layer of elastomeric material consists of a rubber latex of black colour, which is caused to coagulate only at the moment of use, by spraying and simultaneous mS g with a suitable coagulating agent. According to another characteristic, the tube system contained in said second layer is formed of a corrugated flexible tubing of plastic material, arranged as a serpentine. According to a further characteristic, the solar energy collector of the present invention forms a continuous waterproof element, practicable by pedestrians and motor vehicles, for the roofing of buildings. According to a still further characteristic of the present invention when the collector is required to have a self contained storage capacity said second layer comprises furthermore storage elements of thermal energy, under form of latent heat, consisting of sealed cells containing a chemical hydrate compound having a high latent heat of crystallization, which can be selected so as to have a temperature of crystallization at a predetermined point of the interval between OP and 100oC, The said chemical compound may be, for example, of the type described in the European Patent application No. 0076897, published on April 20, 1983, in the name of the sameApplicant. Finally, according to an even further characteristic, in the event that the source of energy being utilized should have a high temperature, the collector is provided with a surface layer of refractory material. The solar energy collector with the composite structure of the present invention is constructed on the site of use, starting from prefabricated elements, with a particularly suitable process comprising the stages of arranging onto a load bearing surface said fourth layer of insulating material in preformed semirigid panels, or by spraying arranging onto the fourth layer said third layer of material with high reflectivity arranging onto the third layer said serpentine tubing, disposed into one or more circuits the ends of which project from the collector pouring a layer of concrete with additives, having high thermal conductivity, after previous possible laying of a metal reinforcement and covering the whole with said first layer applied by spraying, covering also the surfaces close to and adjoining the collector, so as to form a single seamless waterproof surface.The solar energy collector according to the present invention is preferably used in an air conditioning plant of a building, characterized by comprising one or more collecting surfaces consisting of said collector one or more conditioning surfaces, consisting of a layer of said thermal energy storage elements into which is buried a system of tubes, through which flows a heat exchange fluid, the whole being dislocated into the surface layer of the building masonry structures, or into some other suitable dislocation a central storage reservoir, formed of a plurality of layers of said thermal energy storage elements plunged into a heat exchange fluid an interconnection, regulation, pumping and control system, connecting said tube systems of the collecting and conditioning surfaces to said central reservoir. The aforementioned air conditioning plant can be usefully associated with a plant for the production of electric energy, characte rized by comprising furthermore a serpentine through which flows a low boiling fluid, arranged inside said central storage reservoir a turbine for the production of electric energy, operated by the low boiling fluid vaporized in said serpentine a condenser of the low boiling fluid, arranged downstream of said turbine for the feeding of said serpentine. The invention will anyhow be described in further detail hereinafter, with reference to an embodiment wherein the collector is used as coverage for the roof of a building, and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1A is a diagrammatic cross section view of the solar energy collector according to the present invention, arranged as coverage for the roof of a building Figure 1B is a view similar to that of figure LA, wherein part of the insulating layer is replaced by thermal energy storage elements Figure 2 is a block diagram of the air conditioning plant using the collector of figure 1A and Figure 3 is a cable and trunk schematic of the electric energy production system associated to the air conditioning plant shown in figure 2. Figure 1A shows diagrammatically, in a cross section, the slab 1 forming the roof of a building. The solar energy collector of the present invention is laid directly in contact with the slab 1, and it consists of a composite structure, obtained on site, comprising four layers each having a different function. Starting from the outward part, i.e. from the surface of the collector C exposed to sun radiation, the following layers are obtained. A first layer 2, formed of a rubber latex of black colour, which is caused to coagulate only at the moment of use by addition of a suitable coagulating agent. The latex employed will suitably be a latex of natural origin, containing the proper stabilizing and emulsifying elements. The coa gulating agent is CaCl2 which, in the preferred case of application by spraying, is mixed with the latex directly in the spray. The covering thus obtained has a high surface roughness, with low values of radiation and reflectivity, while having excellent characteristics of elastic strain and of resistance to mechanical stresses without tearing. An example of a rubber of this type is that known on the market under the name of RUBBER ADHESIVE , produced by the firm FINA ITAIIANA of Milan. A second layer 3, consisting of a concrete mixture 4 with an additive apt to increase its characteristics of thermal conductivity, into which is buried a system of tubes 6, arranged as a serpentine, a heat exchange fluid suitably consisting of water flowing in said tubes0 The system of tubes 6, buried in the layer 3, is formed of one or more circuits of a corrugated flexible tubing of plastic material, allowing a high coefficient of heat transmission between concrete and heat exchange fluid. When the collector C has to support heavier loads than those normally weighing on the covering of a roof, for instance for pavings, roads, ramps or the like, the mixture 4 will have a greater thickness than that shown in figure 1, and it will comprise a wire net or other suitable reinforcement not shown , which will give it the required mechanical characteristics of strength. A third layer 7 of material with high reflectivity, formed of a simple aluminium sheet, and finally a fourth and last layer 8, placed in direct contact with the slab 1 and formed of insulating material, as for example foamed polyurethan, or else closed cell extruded polyethylene. The layer 8 may advantageously by preformed with a series of reliefs 5 of cubic, frusto pyrainidal or frusto conical shape, apt to delimit the free spaces available for the tubes 6, facilitating their positioning and also forming with their tops a convenient plane for smoothing the concrete layer 4. This shape of the layer 8 furthermore allows to reduce the total quantity of concrete used and, thus, the weight of the manufactured article, finally favouring the conveyance of the heat absorbed by the surface 2 towards the tubes 6. The layer 7 is normally pre applied on the layer 8, forming an integrating part thereof, and it can be totally omitted if there is requirement to limit the costs. The high quality of the rubber layer 2, combined with the mechanical characteristics of the underlying layer 3, allow to use the collector C as an element for any type of coverages, even if subjected to pedestrian or vehicular traffic, without disturbing the working process of the collector or deteriorating its components. The rubber layer 2 extends up to covering also the peripheral gutter and drain areas of the roofing, indicated by 2a in figure 1, creating a single waterproof mantle which binds the collector C to the surrounding structure, and preventing any type of humidity infiltration. Figure 1B illustrates a collector according to the present invention, wherein the reliefs 5 of the layer 8 have been replaced by storage elements 9 of thermal energy under form of latent heat. This type of collector is particularly appropriate when the same is required to have a certain capacity of storage, such as to make more constant in time the temperature level of the heat exchange fluid circulating in the collector. Such a type of collector is used, for example, in desalting plants, or in climates characterized by fast and frequent temperature variations or by high day night temperature changes. The energy storage elements 9, used in the present invention, are preferably those object of the already cited European Patent Application No. 0076897. Said elements are available in The form of polyethylene belts comprising a plurality of sealed cells containing a chemical hydrate compound having a high latent heat of crystallization and a temperature of crystallization which can be prefixed at will within the interval included between OP and 1O0C. Of course, also elements 9 of a different type could be adopted, provided they allow to store considerable quantities of thermal energy at a prefixed temperature. The technique used for constructing and applying the collector according to the present invention, requires no machinery, but simply a number of. elementary operations for laying the aforedescribed elements directly on the site of use. The surface onto which is applied the collector C is first of all covered with a layer 8 of insulating material in the form of semirigid panels, sealed together in known manner. Alternatively, and particularly when applying the collector C onto inclined surfaces, the layer 8 can be applied by spraying. The layer 7, formed of an aluminium sheet, is then placed over the insulating layer 8, unless such sheet has already been pre applied on said layer 8. At this stage, the tubes 6 are laid onto the layer 7, into one or more appropriate circuits, said tubes allowing the passage of the heat exchange fluid. The tubes 6 are obviously arranged in such a manner that the ends of the circuits formed therefrom come to find themselves in a single area at the periphery of the collector C, from which they may easily be connected to the other tubings of the control systems, better described hereinafter. In the case of the collector illustrated in figure 1B, the laying of the tubes 6 is evidently preceded by the positioning of the polyethylene belts containing the heat storage elements 9. After having thus prearranged the tubes 6, a concrete mixture 4 preferably mixed with an additive apt to increase its thermal conductivity is poured on said tubing. The casting of the concrete mixture 4 may be preceded in case that the collector C is designed to support loads by the laying of a wire net or other metal reinforcement. The construction of the collector C is completed after setting of the mixture 4 by applying the rubber layer 2. According to a preferred technique of the present invention, use is made of a rubber latex of the type known on the market as RUBBER ADHESIVE , which is applied by spraying with simultaneous addition of a solution of Call, h as coagulating agent. One thereby obtains a continuous, seam less, waterproof layer, with a very rough surface of black colour, extending so as to cover all those elements surrounding the collector drain pipes, gutters, waste pipes and the like , which are thus simultaneously waterproofed. It should be noted at this point as it besides appears evident from the process described hereabove that the collector object of the present invention can be applied on any surface, whether horizontal or inclined, and whether in good, bad or even very bad maintenance conditions, without having to resort to any costly operations for preparing said surface. The working of the solar energy collector according to the present invention will now be described with reference to an airconditioning plant, with or without production of electric energy, which forms a preferred use thereof. The air conditioning plant is illustrated in the block diagram of figure 2, while the cable and trunk schematic concerning the production of electric energy is shown in figure 3. In the following description, reference will be made to these two figures, assuming that the source of thermal energy is the sun. The principle remains unvaried in the event that the source of thermal energy should be of a different type for instance, regeneration heat from exothermic chemical processes, or from hot exhaust smokes or gases but for the precaution that the collector C will in this case have to be covered with a layer of refractory material not shown , to prevent the extreme temperature of the energy source from damaging the surface layer of the collector. The incident radiation coming from the sun hits the collector C onto its rubber layer 2. Since this latter has a very low reflectivity, almost the entire incident radiation is absorbed, thanks also to the fact that the particularly rough surface easily seizes any small part of reflecting radiation. The radiations which are not immediately absorbed by the layer 2, cross the layer 3 transferring part of their own energy, and they eventually get reflected by the aluminium sheet of the layer 7, crossing once more the layer 3. It can thus be said that only a negligible part of the incident radiation is not absorbed by the layer 2 or by the layer 3. As a result, these layers obviously undergo a heating process and they therefore tend to transfer heat onto the surrounding elements. Thanks to the scarce radiating power of the rubber, the layer 2 transfers heat almost exclusively by conduction and, due to the high ratio between the conduction coefficient of the mixture 4 and the air conduction coefficient, the amount of heat transferred by conduction from the layer 2 to the environment is relatively modest.On the opposite side, the layer of insulating material 8 limits the transfer of heat by conduction to the underlying slab 1 the transfer of heat by radiation being instead stopped by the reflecting layer 7 . The collector C therefore undergoes a concentrated heating action in its inner layer 3, containing the tubes 6 and, possibly, the storage elements 9. These last ones, as already said, contain a chemical hydrate compound having a high latent heat of crystallization and a temperature of crystallization which can be preset during constrtction at any point of the interval between oc and 1O00C. The temperature of crystallization is chosen according to the conditions of radiation and to the type of thermal energy source, so as to keep as close as possible to the average temperature existing inside the collector C. In the case under consideration, making use of a solar energy source, said temperature may for instance be included in the interval between 500 and 600C. The air conditioning plant making use of the collector C comprises furthermore a series of air conditioning surfaces U, a heat storage central reservoir A and an interconnection and control systemI. The working of said plant will now be described with reference to the collector illustrated in figure 1B. It is evident that the working of the simpler collector shown in figure 1A is perfectly similar. It will have to be considered that, in this case, the function performed by the storage elements 9 will cease, said elements being replaced by the reliefs 5 of insulating material, which have the simple task to convey most of the heat absorbed by the surface 2 towards the tubes 6. The air conditioning surfaces U are distributed in the building to be conditioned in the most suitable position floors, recesses for radiators in the event of restructuring old plants, walls and the like , and they have the same structure as the layer 3 of the collector C. Obviously, in this case, the temperature of crystallization of the heat storage elements 9 will be chosen according to the desired air conditioning temperature. For instance, in the case of buildings, said temperature may be included in the interval between 230 and 280C, so as to obtain a room temperature between 180 and 230C the 50C temperature jump corresponds to that existing between the external part and the internal part of the conditioning surfaces U . The central storage reservoir A is formed of an outwardly insulated tank, containing a large number of storage elements 9 plunged in the heat exchange fluid. In this case, the elements 9 have a temperature of crystallization which is slightly above that of the elements 9 of the conditioning surfaces U, in order to facilitate heat exchange. Alternatively, it is possible to provide in the reservoir A for two areas wherein the elements 9 have different temperatures of crystallization. A first area, with a lower temperature, designed to satisfy the requirements of air conditioning and hot water for sanitary use, and a second area, with a higher temperature, for the production of electric energy, as better described hereinafter. The collector C, the conditioning surfaces U and the central storage reservoir A are finally mutually connected by an interconnection, regulation and pimping system I, equipped with a regulation and control electronic unit which coordinates the working of the entire plant, on supply of information sent by thermostats appropriately dislocated in the plant. As the plant starts to work, the collector C heats up to bringing the elements 9 to their temperature of crystallization, at which temperature they absorb heat under form of latent heat, starting to gradually melt in their own water of crystallization. As soon as the temperature inside the collector C rises above the temperature existing in the reservoir A, the system I provides to circulate the heat exchange fluid inside the tubes 6 cooling the elements 9, preventing the complete dissolving of the chemical compound contained therein and transferring the heat inside the reservoir A, and precisely to the elements 9 housed therein, which have a lower temperature of crystallization than the elements 9 present in the collector C. The process continues with a prolonged storage of heat, under form of latent heat of crystallization, inside the reservoir A. The system I of course provides to interrupt the circulation of the heat exchange fluid inside the collector C, as soon as the temperature therein falls below the temperature existing in the central reservoir A, due to lack of sun radiation night time, cloudiness, winter season . At the same time, the system I provides to circulate the heat exchange fluid within the tubes existing in the conditioning surfaces U, keeping the latter at their operative temperature temperature of crystallization of the elements 9 connected thereto . It is evident, from what has been said, that the surfaces U have a double function, namely they let out heat when the room temperature is below their operative temperature, while they absorb heat when opposite conditions occur, transferring it then to the reservoir A. The room temperature is hence under perfect control, both during the winter and during the summer season. An accurate reckoning of the number of elements 9 present in the storage reservoir A, allows to store in the summer season an amount of thermal energy sufficient to overcome, without any problems, the whole winter season, even in scarcely favourable conditions of sun radiation. From the above, it is evident that the entire plant for what concerns the chemical transformation of the compound contained in the elements 9 normally remains in an isothermal state of incomplete transformation, and thus in conditions allowing a perfect control of the temperatures, and it is only during the summer season that it can reach the conditions wherein all the elements 9 of the reservoir A, as well as those of the conditioning surfaces U and of the collector C, are completely dissolved. In this case, the temperature inside the reservoir A tends to rise and the possibility to obtain a conditioning from the surfaces U in the sense of absorbing heat from the environment during the summer season, would thereby be lost. It is evidently possible to dispose of this heat in excess by simply cooling down with water the reservoir A, but this is by no means convenient, unless requiring to heat a considerable amount of water for instance, in greenhouses or in other industrial applications . In the application to air conditioning for buildings, according to the present invention, it has instead been found very convenient for this purpose to equip the air conditioning plant with a system for producing electric energy, as shown in figure 3. This system is essentially formed of a closed circuit containing a low boiling fluid which is vaporized inside a serpentine S arranged in the hottest area of the reservoir A, to operate a turbine T which produces electric energy. The fluid coming out the turbine T is completely recondensed in the condenser F and sent back to the serpentine S. In this way, there is a further possibility to control the tem perature of the reservoir A, with parallel production of electric energy which, especially in the months of higher sun radiation, may form a valid contribution to electricity consumptions. In the winter months, the production of electric energy may instead help to make the above plant autonomous and independent from any requirement of connection to the mains, particularly for what concerns the working of the system I. As it appears evident from the above description, the thermal energy collector according to the present invention and the respective plant making use threof, are apt to brilliantly solve the various problems pointed out further above in connection with the utilization of thermal energy from sun radiation or from other sources. In particular, they allow to greatly reduce the costs, both for what concerns the elements employed in the structure, and for what concerns the application thereof, which merely requires the simple equipnent already available to the operators in the field to positively avoid the use of transparent and, in any case, particularly delicate surfaces, with the possibility to use as collectors the surfaces already designed for other uses ramps, stairs, terraces with pedestrian traffic, and the like the possibility to be placed, in substitution for other types of coverages,directly in contact with the structure of the building, with consequent saving of costs to store great quantities of heat, under form of latent heat, in a relatively limited space and at a relatively low temperature, such that it will anyhow create no problems of heat insulation to be used both as a plant for producing heat and as a plant for air conditioning in summer the simultaneous production of electric energy. The invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, to a process and to a plant for the use thereof, but there may evidently be other embodiments differing from the above, particularly for what concerns the use of the collector with various other sources of thermal energy, or for adapting the plant described to different types of uses. All such modifications and variants are anyhow within reach of a technical expert in the field, and thus fall within the scope of the present invention.
