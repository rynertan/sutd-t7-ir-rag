# INSERTABLY ADJUSTABLE AND ANGULARY ADJUSTABLE INLET GUIDE VANE APPARATUS FOR A COMPRESSOR

## Abstract
An inlet guide vane apparatus for the adjustable insertion and retraction of a guide vane into the inlet passage of a com pressor and the adjustable varying of the flow direction of the fluid downstream of the vane body by varying the angle of at tack of the vane body includes a longitudinal vane body pro truding part way across the inlet passage of the compressor through an aperture in the inlet shroud, and a winglet attached to the end of the vane body extending inboard the compressor inlet shroud. The degree of insertion of the vane body into the passage may be controlled by a pneumatically actuated slid able plunger attached to the vane body and responsive to the compressor discharge pressure. The angle of attack of the vane body may be controlled by a rotatable plunger cylinder having a longitudinally extending groove engaging a pin radially extending from a lateral portion of the body of the plunger. The plunger cylinder can be rotated by a synchronizing ring that meshes with a bevel gear fixed to one end of the plunger cylin der. Alternatively, the plunger cylinder may be fixed and have a curved groove wherein the angle of attack can vary with the degree of insertion.
