# Tunnel boring machine.

## Abstract
A tunneling machine 10 adapted to cut tunnels on a continuous basis and to apply continuous pressure on the tunnel face even during repositioning of the gripping legs 13, 14, 15, 16 is disclosed. The machine includes at least two supporting frames 11, 12 having a plurality of extendi ble feet 13 16 which are adapted to grip the tunnel wall. The support frames 11, 12 are provided with axial bores there through, and a hollow piston extends through all of the bores for longitudinal movement along the axis of the tunnel. A tunneling operation is carried out by extending at least one pair of extendible feet 13 16 against the walls of the tunnel to securely hold at least one of the support frames relative to the tunnel wall. The piston chamber of each support frame which is clamped to the wall is pressurized to drive the cutter head 40 against the face of the tunnel. While the cutter head is being advanced in this manner, unclamped support feet are moved forward to a clamping position to take over when the first mentioned support feet reach the end of their effective stroke. This operation is repeated to apply con tinuous thrust pressure to the cutting head.
