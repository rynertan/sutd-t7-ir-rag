# Digital video signal error correction without overhead bits.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for detecting and significantly correcting bit errors in a pulse code modulated video signal 10 which recognizes the unique spectral characteristics of isolated bit errors in a digital bit stream, which errors generate spectral energy outside the frequency band of the PCM video signal, and utilizes that energy to detect and correct errors without the use of overhead bits. The timing and the amplitude of any energy burst at F
