# Power supply installation for DC electric railroad.

## Abstract
The power supply installation for a direct current railroad comprises two diode bridge connected circuits, only two thyr istor breakers each connected in parallel to each of the two di ode bridge connected circuits, four dc disconnecting switches each connected between each diode bridge con nected circuit and four electric car power supply lines consti tuting a double track, separately. Further, the two diode bridge connected circuits are connected by a dc disconnect ing switch closed only in case of an accident. In case a ground fault occurs at a power supply line, a powering current to the defective line is interrupted by one of the breakers, together with an extension power supply current supplied from an adja cent substation, without exerting an influence of accident upon the other power supply lines. Further, even if one of the breakers is broken, powering currents are kept supplied to all the power supply lines through a mutual spare bus bar.
