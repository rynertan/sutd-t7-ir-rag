More particularly, this invention relates to a new 2 benzoylamino substituted benzylamine derivative represented by formula I EMI1.1 wherein R is a hydrogen atom and a hydroxyl group and a phar maceutical.ly acceptable acid addition salt thereof as well as to a method for the preparation thereof. DEVELOPMENT OF THE INVENTION An expectorant which is heretofore known has two activities one is to discharge sputum with cough by increasing tracheal secretion, fluidizing sputum adhered to respiratory tract and facilitating its separation from the wall of respiratory tract a bronchoexcitosecretory action another is to facilitate discharge by physicochemically reducing a viscosity of sputum trachel mucous dissolution action . Bromhexine generic name,Merck Index, 9th Edition, 1389 represented by formula it EMI2.1 is known as a medicine which has both activities above and has been widely provided for clinical use. For purpose of improving an expectorant action, N acylderivatives of bromhexine were prepared recently Japanese Patent Application OPI 16640 76 corresponding to German Patent 2,440,596,British Patent 1,432,904, French Patent 2,259,595, SpanishPatent 418,443, hereafter the same and brovanexine generic name of formula III EMI2.2 was recognized to be a good expectorant in screening of these derivatives and has been clinically used. However, brovanexine of formula III shows no improvement in an expectorant activity as compared to bromhexine of formula II but shows a slight improvement in toxicity. As a result of extensive investigations on new compounds having a potent expectorant activity, it has been found that compounds of formula I have extremely weak toxicity and possess a potent expectorant activity by approxima tely 10 times or more when compared to those of formulae II and III , and thus this invention has been accomplished.

The compounds of this invention exhibit strong expectorant activity with minimized side effects. The high order of these activities of the active agent of this invention is evidenced by test in lower animals, representative of which are reported herein. The compound of this invention can be administered per os, e.g., in the form of pills or tables, in which it may be present together with the usual pharmaceutical carriers, conventionally by compounding the compounds of this invention together with a customary carrier or adjuvant, such as talc, magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, gelatin, any of numerous gums, and the like. Thus, in their most advantageous form, the compositions of this invention will contain a non toxic pharmaceutical carrier in addition to the active ingredient of this invention.Exemplary solid carriers are lactose, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, starch, terra alba, dicalcium acacia, or the like. Representative liquid carrers are peanut oil, sesame oil, olive oil, water, or the like.

For oral administration, the active ingre dient and pharmaceutical carrier may, for example, take the form of a granule, pill, tablet, lozenge, elixir, syrup, or other liquid suspension or emulsion, whereas, for parenteral administration, the composition may be in the form of a sterile solution or suppository. The method of using the compounds of this invention comprises internally or externally administering the compounds of this invention, preferably orally or parenterally and preferably admixed with the pharmaceutical carrier, for example, in the form of any of the above compositions, or filled into a capsule, to alleviate conditions to be treated and symptoms thereof in a living animal body. Illustratively, it may be used in an amount of about 1 to about 100 mg. per unit dose, preferably 3 to 30 mg. for an oral dose, while parenteral dosages are usually less and ordinarily about one half of the oral dose. The unit dose is preferably given a suitable number of times daily, typically three times.The daily dose may vary depending upon the number of times given. Naturally, a suitable clinical dose must be adjusted in accordance with the condition, age, and weight of the patient, and it goes without saying that the enhanced activities of the compounds of this invention, together with their reduced side effects, also make it suitable for wide variations, and the invention therefore should not be limited by the exact ranges stated. The exact dosage, both unit dosage and daily dosage, will of course have to be determined according to established medical principles. Expectorant activity is generally evaluated by two effects one is an effect on acceleration of tracheal secretion and another is an effect on dissolution of mucus on the tracheal tract. The former is determined by examining an effect on the secretory activity of the tracheal secretory cells and the latter by examining an effect on the dissolution of acid glycoprotein in submucosal glandular cells of the trachea. As reference drugs, two compounds structurally similar to the compound of this invention were used.

Nippon Yakurigaku Zasshi, 77, 559 568 1981 . Male mongrel dogs weighing 10 to 12 kg were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 30 mg kg, i.v. . The trachea was quickly excised about 10 cm long and rapidly transfered to a Hanks solution 95 O2 5 C02, 37 10 .Connective tissues around ere removed and the trachea was cut into strips about 2 cm long. The tracheal strips were preincubated for 30 minutes in Hanks solution, and then drugs were added to the solution and the mixtures were further incubated for 30 minutes. The tracheal strips were then fixed with a 10 formaldehyde isotonic solution followed by dehydrating in a series of graded ethanol concentrations and paraffinembedding in a conventional manner. Sections 4 pm thick were cut with a Jung type microtome and stained with alcian blue pH 2.5 periodic acid Schiff AB pH 2.5 PAS . The specimens were studied by the optical microscopic observation with the effects of drugs on the secretory activities of the tracheal secretory cells and on the dissolution of acid glycoprotein in submucosal glandular cells of the tracheal.1. Effect on the secretory activity of the tracheal secretory cells. A thickness, between basement membrance and cartilage thickness of endepidermis wall is referred to as W , and acinar inner diameter of submucosal gland AI were measured. Then, acinar inner diameter of submucosal gland to wall ratio A1WR was calculated. Increase of AIR reflects enhancement of the secretory activity in submucosal gland.If test drug has a significant increase in AIWR, it has a respiratory tract fluid RTF increasing effect. Results are shown in Table 1.

In more detail, the compound of this invention showed a significant increase in AI WR at a dose of 1 x 10 M whereas neither reference drug 1 nor reference drug 2 showed any significant increase in A1WR as compared to control. Only reference drug 1 showed a significant increase in A WR at a dose of 1 x 10 N. In other words, the enhancement of the compound of this invention in A1WR was about 10 times as strong as that of reference drugs 1 and 2. Based on the data in Table 1, a dose required for increasing A1WR of each of the compounds tested by 25 ED25 was calculated. Results are shown in Table II in which ED50 is expressed by an increasing rate in AIWR of control to that of each of the compounds at a given dose.

Effect on the Dissolution of Acid Glycoprotein in Submucosal Glandular Cells of the Trachea. As a tracheal mucus dissolution activity, an effect on the dissolution of acid glycoprotein in submucosal glandu lar cells was observed. In double staining with AB pH 2.5 PAS, submucosal glandular cells containing much acid glycoprotein were strongly stained blue because of the reaction with AB. When acid glycoprotein in glandular cells is dissolved and its acid groups were lost, it is stained with PAS instead ofAB. Consequently, submucosal glandular cells turned to red from blue in color. The ratio of blue glandular cells to total glandular cells was observed, and the effect on the dissolution of acid glycoprotein was estimated by decrease in the ratio. Results are shown in Table III.

This activity was 10 times stronger than that of reference drugs 1 and 2. Based on the above data, a dose of each of the compounds tested required for decreasing acid glycoprotein by 50 ED50 was calculated.
