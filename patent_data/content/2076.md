# Direction finding apparatus.

## Abstract
A radio direction finding apparatus comprising an omnidirectional receiving element 21 , an array of directional receiving elements 1.1 1.2N , two log video detectors 15, 16 suited for separate connection to two contiguous elements of said array and a subtraction circuit 27 for generating a signal containing the azimuth data of an r.f. transmitter. In order to select echoes received through the main lobes of the two connected receiving elements from those received through the main lobe of the one element and a side lobe of the other element, the radio direction finding apparatus is provided with a threshold circuit 18 and two gate circuits 19, 20 separately inserted between the log video detectors 15, 16 and the subtraction circuit 27 . The threshold circuit 18 passes the applied signals through the gate circuits 19, 20 if the strength of the latter signals exceeds that of the echo signal obtained from the omnidirectional receiving element 21 via a third log video detector 22 .
