## Description
Oxidation resistant iron nickel chromium alloy. The present invention is directed to improving the oxidation resistance of iron nickel chromium alloys. For many years an iron nickel chromium alloy nominally containing 30 35 Ni, 19 23E Cr, 0.15 to 0.68 aluminium, 0.15 to 0.6 titanium, manganese in amounts up to 1.5 , e.g. about 1 manganese, up to about 0.75 copper, up to 1 silicon, and up to about 0.1 carbon, the balance, apart from impurities, being iron, has been used in such applications as heat exchanger tubing, process piping, carburizing fixtures and retorts, furnace components, and heating element sheathing. it is known for its resistance to oxidation at elevated temperatures and for a number of other properties, including stable structure, ductility, resistance to carburization, and corrosion resistance. All percentages in this specification and claims are by weight. The presence of manganese in iron nickel chromium alloys, as is known, confers a number of advantages, including its ability to fix sulphur which otherwise exercises a detrimental influence on various metallurgical characteristics. Also, manganese is deemed to enhance weldability and is considered to act as a deoxidant.Its use in the manufacture of such alloys is thought to be a carryover from steelmaking practice. The present invention is based on the discovery that the high temperature oxidation resistance of ironnickel chromium alloys, and in particular of the commercial alloy referred to above, can be improved by controlling the amount of manganese introduced in their manufacture. It is emphasised that it is not the principal aim of the invention to eliminate manganese as an essential constituent from the type of iron nickel chromium alloys under consideration but rather to control it. to obtain the benefits of improved oxidation resistance as demonstrated herein. According to the invention, in the manufacture of an oxidation resistant iron nickel chromium alloy the manganese is controlled so as not to exceed 0.6 , so as to improve the high temperature oxidation resistance compared with an otherwise similar alloy having a higher content of manganese. The invention is particularly directed to alloys containing 20 to 45 nickel, 15 to 25 chromium, manganese in an amount up to about 0.6 , up to about 0.38 carbon, up to about 0.3 nitrogen, up to about 1 aluminium, up to about 1 titanium, and up to 2 copper, the balance, apart from impurities, being iron. Thus silicon, sulphur and phosphorus may be present in usual impurity amounts. Silicon, if present, should not exceed 1.5 , and sulphur and phosphorus should be maintained at low levels consistent with good melt practice. Within the ranges set forth, nickel may be from 30 to 35 , chromium from 19 to 23 , carbon up to 0.2 , and nitrogen from 0.05 to 0.25 . More particularly, the composition apart from manganese may be that of the commercial alloy referred to above. The improvement in elevated temperature oxidation resistance of iron nickel chromium alloys is shown by the results of cyclic oxidation tests on two alloys representative of the invention and two samples of the commercial alloy referred to above. In Table I below are given the compositions of theCommercial Alloy and an alloy, Alloy 1, representative of the instant invention TABLE I Mn C Ni Cr Al Ti Cu Si Fe Alloy Commercial 0.96 0.04 31.13 21.43 0.52 0.47 0.45 0.36 Bal. 1 0.10 0.05 32.93 20.93 0.45 0.50 0.04 0.54 Bal. including imparities Air melted 14 kg samples of the alloys were forged to flats, hot rolled to 7.9 mm and cold rolled to 3.2 mm.Specimens were subjected to a cyclic oxidation test consisting of holding the specimen for 15 minutes at temperature 9820C , and then cooling 5 minutes in air. This cycle was repeated over a test period of 1000 hours.Specimens were examined at 100 hour intervals. Prior to test the specimens were annealed at 11770C and water quenched. Oxide was removed by grinding to 120 grit. The test results are set out in Table II.
