# An assembly for connecting electrical connectors to cable.

## Abstract
In an assembly for connecting electrical connectors 2 to flat multi conductor cable 26 , an arm 52 of a robot 34 is provided with a connector transfer nest 94 into which a connector 2 can be fed at a connector feed station 40 , for transfer by the robot 34 to a press 42 through which the cable 26 has been fed. The nest 94 is inserted into the press 42 by the robot 34 so that the cable 26 extends through the nest 194 , and the press 142 is then opeiated to actuate the nest 94 to force conductor receiving portions 32 of terminals 18 in the connector 2 through the cable 26 to receive the cable conductors 27 . The robot 34 is then operated to withdraw the nest 94 from the press 42 leaving the connector 2 on the cable 26 and the cable 26 is fed forward to allow the robot 34 to apply a further connector 2 thereto and so on. A cable severing station 44 may be provided for severing the cable 26 with connectors 2 thereon to provide separate electrical harnesses.
