# Polyolefin resin composition.

## Abstract
A polyolefin resin composition which is suitable mainly for affording superior processing properties of sheet and low variation of flowability at hot processing temperatures comprises A a resin mixture comprising specified percen tages of a polypropylene resin and a polyethylene resin, B a polyolefin resin modified with a polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acid, its salt or its ester by graft polymerization and C finely divided vegetable fibers, the ratio of A to B and the amount of C in the composition being both specified. Further an agent D may be added to the composition, such as a petroleum resin, rosin, rosin like resin, plasticizer or inorganic filler.
