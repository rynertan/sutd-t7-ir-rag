# Pistol safety holder.

## Abstract
The holster makes it possible to prevent a stranger from seizing the weapon by drawing it without authorization from the holster worn by the interested person. It comprises a pivotable cover B hinged at its one end 8 and able to cover, in its protective position, at least the hammer of the weapon. Said cover is pulled by a spring 5 to be brought to its open position, i.e., of release of the weapon, by turning in the direction opposite to that in which the grip 9 of the weapon is located. Said cover exhibits an appendix 1 solid with a right angle flange 2 which in the protective position engages quickly in an annular groove 3 of a fast action lever 4 located on the inside of the holster, or next to the body of the person wearing it. A spring 6 pulls said lever 4 to its locking position. A further pivoted safety lever 7 prevents fast action lever 4 from being moved from its locking position to open position.

## Description
Pistol safety holderThis invention has as its object a pistol safety holster, making it possible to prevent a stranger from seizing the weapon by drawing it without authorization from the holster worn by the interested party.It does not appear to the owner of this invention that holsters exist which are able to perform this task and which, at the same time, allow a safe and fast drawing of the weapon.The holster in question is characterized by protective elements able to prevent a stranger from seizing the weapon by drawing it without authorization from the holster, immediateaction elements enabling the person wearing the holster to draw the weapon quickly and grip it, and safety elements able to prevent an incorrect functioning of said protective and action elements.For greater clarification, the accompanying drawing represents a preferred nonlimiting embodiment of the holster according to this invention. Fig. 1 shows it in a side view, with the protective cover open. Fig. 2 shows it partially, still in side view, with the cover closed, i.e., in the position protecting the weapon and with the various elements in their safety position Fig. 3 is the cross section of the fast action lever made according to the design indicated in Fig. 2.With reference to the various figures the holster comprises part A preferably of metal that can optionally be covered with leather or equivalent material, and protective cover B, hinged at 8 to A, which in its closed position, shown in Fig. 2, protects the hammer 9 of the weapon, preventing drawing of said weapon by a stranger.Solid with protective cover B, pulled in open position by spring 5, is appendix 1, exhibiting right angle flange 2 that is inserted into groove 3 of fast action lever 4, hinged at 10, when the lever is in its vertical safety position.Lever 4 is pulled by spring 6 to be brought into its vertical position.Head 4 of lever 4 is rounded so that when cover B is brought from its open position Fig. 1 to closed position Fig. 2 , right angle flange 2 first encounters said rounded part 4 , moves the top of lever 4 toward the right, as shown in Fig. 1 and loads spring 6, until said flange 2 encounters groove 3 and penetrates into it.In this position, lever 4 can spring back to the vertical position Fig. 2 , i.e. the position of locking of cover B and therefore the safety position.To release cover B, when the person wearing the holster wishes to free the weapon and draw it from the holster, it suffices to act with a finger by moving lever 4 to the right Fig. 1 until right angle flange 2 is released from groove 3, allowing spring 5 to cause the pivoting of the cover to its open position.To prevent accidental movement of lever 4 a safety device is provided consisting of additional lever 7, which is pivoted into the position shown in Fig. 2 when it is desired to lock said lever 4. It should be noted that the various safety devices consisting of lever 4, with its groove 3, appendix 1 with right angle flange 2, spring 6 and lever 7, are placed on the inside wall of holster A, or next to the body of the person wearing the holster, so that they are not accessible to strangers.Action by the interested party to release the weapon is therefore very fast it is necessary to pivot lever 7 and act on lever 4 by pushing it to the right Fig. 1 so that cover B, pulled by spring 5 can spontaneously spring to its open position Fig. 1 .The same device is also provided for pistols with an inside hammer. In this case, the cover will be made to confine the back part of the slide.The shape of the various parts can vary, in a manner compatible with what is claimed, without going outside the scope of protection of the patent.
