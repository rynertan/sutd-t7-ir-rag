# APPARATUS FOR ASSEMBLING CONTAINER HALVES

## Abstract
Apparatus for assembling a pair of thin walled metal container counterparts which are brought together axially, are rounded and one inserted into the other substantially without deformation of either of the pair of counterparts so that the inner part is allowed to expand, after insertion, radially and both parts at their juncture are stressed in hoop tension for tightly embracing an adhesive interposed there between and thereby insure a good bond at the seam.
