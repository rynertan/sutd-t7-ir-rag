# Electro optic display cell and method of making same.

## Abstract
An electro optic display cell has an arrangement of display electrodes in contact with a liquid within a sealed enclosure. The enclosure comprises an impervious transpa rent cover and a rigid structural wall member. A seal between the cover and wall member and an elastomeric plug extending between the exterior and interior complete the enclosure. The cell is filled by injecting the liquid into the presealed enclosure by perforating the plug with hollow needles also employed to remove entrapped gas. Upon withdrawal of the needles the perforations collapse to self seal the enclosure but for added integrity the plug is also mechanically clamped. Conveniently, the seal and plug can be formed as an integral elastomeric moulding around a frame member forming the side wall of the enclosure and the frame member clamped between the cover and a separate base.
