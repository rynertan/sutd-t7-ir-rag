## Description
The present invention relates to a process for carrying out a thermal etching treatment of a GaAs semiconductor substrate to be used in molecular beam epitaxy. More particularly, it relates to a process for the thermal removal of surface carbon, carbide or other carbon compounds from a substrate. A molecular beam epitaxy MBE technique with compound semiconductors such as GaAs is often used for the fabrication of high speed devices such as high electron mobility transistors HEMT , and it is well known that a carrier depletion layer is formed around an interrupted growth interface and a substrate epitaxial interface. Such a depletion layer sometimes degrades the performance of the devices. Therefore, cleaning of the substrate in the MBE chamber prior to the epitaxial growth process is very important to an improvement of the quality of the epitaxial films. The major contaminations on a GaAs substrate after chemical etching and loading in to an MBE chamber are oxygen and carbon from carbon dioxide CO₂ or hydrocarbons. This is discussed in an article entitled Interface and doping profile characteristics with molecular beam epitaxy of GaAs GaAs voltage varactor , which appeared in J. Appl. Phys. 45 4 April, 1974. Oxygen can be thermally removed by heating the substrates to about 530 C. However, this does not remove other contamination especially carbon, carbides or other carbon compounds from GaAs substrate. Further, when a semiconductor crystalline layer is epitaxially formed on a surface of a GaAs substrate in a state wherein carbon atoms, and other contamination is present the carbon and other contamination act as acceptors so that an interfacial level between the GaAs substrate and the semiconductor crystalline layer is formed. To avoid the effect of the formation of the interfacial level, the formation of thick buffer layer is necessary. This takes a long time and thus throughput decreases. US A 3992233 describes a process for thermal etching treatment of a GaAs substrate comprising heating the GaAs substrate in a treatment chamber whilst irradiating a surface of the GaAs substrate with an As molecular beam to remove contamination adhering to the GaAs substrate by evaporating a part of it and then subjecting the substrate to further processing steps without it leaving the treatment chamber. In this example the further processing that takes place is the deposition of alternate monologues of caesium and oxygen to form a photocathode. The substrate must be heated to a temperature above 620 C and in the particular example is heated to a temperature of 700 C. According to this invention such a process is characterised in that the substrate is heated to a temperature higher than 750 C, at which temperature both Ga and As evaporate from the GaAs substrate, and in that the further processing steps consist of epitaxial growth by molecular beam epitaxy on the cleaned surface of the substrate. The present invention provides a process for thermal etching treatment of a GaAs substrate for use in molecular beam epitaxy wherein carbon is thermally removed and the surface defect density between the substrate and an epitaxial layer is removed. An advantage of the present invention is that it enables only a thin buffer layer to be provided on which a semiconductor crystalline layer having good properties and less defects is subsequently formed and this increases production throughput. A particular example of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which In order to find the dependence of the thermal etching rate on a GaAs substrate with the arsenic pressure, the present inventor experimented as follows. The 100 GaAs substrate was degreased in trichloroethylene, and rinsed in sequence with methanol and deionized water. The substrate was then chemically etched in H₂SO₄ H₂O H₂O₂, rinsed with deionized water, dried with dry nitrogen gas, and mounted on an Mo block using solder. The thermal etching was carried out in the growth chamber at a substrate temperature of 720 C, 750 C, and 780 C with an As₄ pressure of 2x10 ³Pa 1.5 x 10 ⁵ Torr . The substrate temperature was measured by a calibrated infrared pyrometer. As shown in Figure 2, the etching rates were remarkably increased in accordance with the substrate temperature i.e., approximately 2 nm min 20Å min at 720 C, 6nm min 60Å min at 750 C, and 18nm min 180Å min at 780 C, with an As₄ pressure of 2x10 ³Pa 1.5 x 10 ⁵ Torr. It can be seen that the etching rate remarkably increases at a temperature above 750 C. The inventor also found that the increment of the etching rate as a function of the temperature is almost the same as the vapour pressure of the Ga. The present inventor then studied the dependence of the carrier depletion on the etching depth. Si doped n GaAs layer was grown on an Si doped GaAs substrate at a rate of 1 µm h at a substrate temperature of 640 C. The doping levels of the epitaxial layer and the substrate were 8 x 10¹⁶ cm ³. The thickness of the epitaxial layer was approximately 1 µm. The depth of etching was varied from 0µm to 0.1µm 0 Å to 1000 Å by changing the etching time at the temperatures of 720 C and 750 C. The dependence of the carrier depletion on the etching depth is also shown in Fig. 3. The possibilities of the origin of the carrier depletion are the trap formation and the carrier compensation caused by the As evaporation loss and or the contamination on the initial substrate surface. DLTS measurement was performed to detect deep trap levels near the thermally etched and non etched interfaces. The total concentration of the trap levels of non etched interfaces obtained was less than 1 x 10¹⁰ cm ², which is much less than the amount of the carrier depletion 10¹² cm ² . Therefore, the deep traps may not be the origin of the carrier depletion at the interface. The concentration of the remaining carbon at the substrate epitaxial layer was detected by SIMS measurement using Cs bombardment. Figure 4 show the dependence of the carbon concentration on the depth removed by the thermal etching at 720 C and 750 C. The concentration of the carbon at the interface without thermal etching was 5.5 x 10¹³ cm ². The carbon concentration was reduced to 5.3 x 10¹² cm ² by the etching at 750 C. On the other hand, the concentration of the carbon contamination did not depend on the etching depth in the case of a low etching temperature of 720 C. Even though the substrate was etched to 0.1µm 1,000 Å at the temperature of 720 C, the amount of remaining carbon atoms was 8.3 x 10¹³ cm ². The above results show that there is good correspondence between the concentration of the carbon contamination detected by the SIMS measurement shown in Fig. 4 and the amount of the carrier depletion measured by the C V technique shown in Fig. 3 . Therefore, the carbon contamination remaining on the substrate is considered to be the main cause of the formation of the carrier depletion. The carbon is present even though the substrate is carefully etched with H₂SO₄ etchant and rinsed with deionized water. Since carbon is a shallow acceptor in GaAs, it will compensate donors. When a GaAs substrate is thermally etched above 750 C, carbon CO₂ , C In Figure 6, a GaAs substrate 10 adhered to a 25 molybdenum Mo block not shown by an Indium In solder is introduced into a substrate exchanging chamber 1. Then, the chamber 1 is degassed to 1.3x10 ⁵Pa to 1.3x10 ⁴Pa 10 ⁷ to 10 ⁸ Torr and a gate valve 12 is opened. The GaAs substrate 10 is then moved to a prechamber 2, for preparing the substrate, maintained at a pressure of approximately 2.7x10 ⁷Pa 2 x 10 ⁹ Torr and provided with an As molecular beam source 5. When the As molecular beam is irradiated the degassed pressure in the prechamber 2 is lowered to 1.3x10 ⁵Pa 10 ⁷ Torr . The GaAs substrate 10 on a substrate holder 4, which can be heated, is heated at approximately 750 C for about 3 minutes while the As molecular beam is irradiated, in which the As pressure is 2x10 ³Pa 1.5 x 10 5 Torr , and subsequently, the temperature is lowered at a rate of 20 C min to about 300 C so that the GaAs substrate 10 can be moved to a growth chamber 6. The reason for As molecular beam irradiation is to compensate for the eliminated arsenic atoms caused by the heat treatment 750 C or more. In the growth chamber 6, a GaAs AlGaAs semiconductor epitaxial layer is grown on the GaAs substrate 10 at about 680 C. Reference numerals 7, 8 and 9 denote a substrate holder, an As molecular beam source, and a Ga molecular beam source, respectively. Figure 7 shows a cross sectional view of an wafer produced by a process according to the present invention. As shown in Figure 7, a 0.3 µm thick GaAs buffer layer 22 is formed on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 21. Then, a 6nm 60 Å thick Al Another example of the embodiment in the thermal etching of the present invention is that the GaAs substrate 10 is heated at 780 C for about 1.5 minutes under 2x10 ³Pa 1.5 x 10 ⁵ Torr As pressure. Furthermore, another example is that the GaAs substrate 10 is heated at 770 C for about 9 minutes under 6.7x10 ³Pa 5 x 10 ⁵ Torr As pressure.
