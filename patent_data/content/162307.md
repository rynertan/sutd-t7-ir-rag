# IMAGE SENSOR AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SAME

## Abstract
An image sensor in which a valve metal or nitride thereof is employed as material for the electrode wiring of a metal film, and a part of the metal film wiring is oxidized to form a dielectric film of a charge storage capacitor, thereby pro viding a charge storage capacitor which has the high quality and enables high production yield. By forming a thin film photo diode on the dielectric film, the number of elements having a sandwich structure is reduced by half and the pro duction yield is increased correspondingly.
