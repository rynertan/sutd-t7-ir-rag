# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium having high running stability and good magnetic characteristics without causing any abrasion problem, which comprises a base film, a magnetic layer provided on one surface i.e. the major surface of the base film and a back coat layer provided on the other surface i.e. the back surface of the base film, the back coat layer comprising a binder and non magnetic particles dispersed therein, characterized in that the non magnetic particles comprise at least one soft inorganic pigment of less than 5 in Mohs scale of hardness and at least one hard inorganic pigment of not less than 5 in Mohs sacle of hardness and of not more than 0.2 Âµm in average particle size in a weight ratio of 99 1 to 50 50.
