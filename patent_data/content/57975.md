# Process for producing polycondensates of omega oxypentadeconoic acid.

## Abstract
A process is described for producing polycondensates of Ï‰ oxypentadecanoic acid comprising hydrogenolysis of 2 tetrahydrofuan undecanoic acid or an ester thereof using a mixed catalyst composed of a catalyst for hydrogenation comprising one or more metals of Group VIII of the Periodic Table, copper chromium, or copper zinc, and a solid acid catalyst, by heating under pressure with hydrogen.
