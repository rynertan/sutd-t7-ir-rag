## Abstract
An apparatus for charge wise dosing a metered volume quantity of liquid medium to be supplied continuously under delivery pressure, comprising a pair of serially connected cylinder 2, 3 and piston 7, 8 assemblies of different diameters the cylinder blocks 2, 3 being arranged axially relatively to each other, forming a composite housing 1 a supply conduit 4 for the flowing medium connected to the smaller diameter cylinder block 2 and a filling nozzle 5 connected to the larger diameter cylinder block 3 and con taining a discharge opening 6 a tube 10 operating as a piston member for reciprocation in the composite housing 1 , which tube 10 is in direct communication with the smaller diameter cylinder block 2 and connected to the larger dima ter cylinder block 3 via a passage 13 provided in the larger diameter piston 7 . The tube 10 operating as piston member carries at least the larger diameter piston 7 a first valve 11 by means of which the passage 13 in the larger diameter piston 7 is closable and a second valve 12 by means of which the access to the filling nozzle 5 is closable and means for operating the valves and control means therefor.
