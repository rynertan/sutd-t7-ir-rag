With rezerence to the figures of the drawing, it should be noted that in the following description will be omitted the functional and structural details ol those parts described anQ illustrated by the Applicant in his mentioned italian copending patent applications filed respectively on may and september l98i, since the mentioned applications are herein incorporated by reference. Accordingly the following description will disclose Only the main units pertaining to the present invention. In the drawing the reference character T generally indicates an agricultural tractor, of known type,and having a power sufficient to assure both the driving thereof and the towing necessary for carrying out the agricultural working operations,as well as a spare power effective to be supplied, through a known oleodynamic pump, to the systems for rising and lowering the grouna processing apparatus, such au a plough ana the like. Said spare power to be supplied to the tractor by oleodynamic means has to be sufficient, in the tractors associated to the improved apparatus, to supply oleodynamic motors which,in turn, supply power, through suitable circuits, to a motor preferably though not limitatively of the or ital type, to the rotors and operating means associated to said apparatu. which are described in a more detailed way in the mention ed copending application. Since the instant apparatus is coupled to the tractor in a shiftable anu replaceable way, the hydraulic circuits are at least partially formed by flexible ducts and hoses, effective to resist against the operating pressures, and comprise fittings and quick connection joints, for a Quick engagement and disengagement, in order to assure the circuit continuity. In turn the mentioned circuit is of the closed type,ror recirculating the oil that is the medium for applying the oleodynamic pressure these ducts and the circuit components have been partially indicated in the figures of the drawing ana indicateu,where they are shown, by the letter C, independently from the fact that they are inlet or return ducts, since these details pertain to the known prior art. Considering the average requirements for operorion of the agricultural tractors, and more specitically the power requirements for the several uses ana applications oi the associatea apparatus it is provided that, in the application range related to the applications of the present invention, tractors will be advantageously used having a power of at least 6un and a weight or the order of 3,000 Kg. Likewise any specific descriptions of the pumps and motors pertaining to the hydraulic circuit thereto also pertain the oil recovering and recirculating reservoirs will be omitted, since these means and components are generally provided on a tractor and structurally associatea to the differential gear or the tractor itself. According to a further advantageous characteristic or the invention the mechanical power source, that is the hydraulic motor,preierably or the orbital type, is located in the apparatus assembly in a well centered way, for an optimal weight distributing. Said hydraulic motor has been generally indicated at M in several figures and it has been schematically reproduced, by omitting the constructional details thereof There is advantageously exploited the presence,which is well known, of bearings space on the sharn not shown of the hydraulic motor M, which is advantageously located as it is shown in fig.6 and, in a more detailed way, in fig.9 in order to use the projecting ends of said shaft for supporting the grass spreading rotors, which are characteristic of the present invention, These rotors, which are described in a more detailed way in the mentioned italian copenaing patent application filed on September 1981 see in particular fig 7A of the mentioned application which has been reproduced, on a reduced scaie,in fig.5 ol the accompanying drawing are suitably protected by a shield or protecting member loefor example made of a perforated metal sheet and they comprise a plurality of grass spreading rou snaped elements 12.These elements extena rrom a disk hub 14,for example in a resilient way, the coupling being obtained in this case for example by means of needle or coil spring 16 fig.9 . The mentioned rod shaped members may be oz the muitipie type as it is schematically shown at 12 in figs.1,4,6 and 9 in a partial way . As it is illustrated in the mentioned italian copending Applications,the grass spreading rotors comprising said elements 12 are so arranged in the apparatus in such a way as to operate above the flat frustum of cone shaped surfaces lo or grass cutting disks 2u the outlines tnereo are illustratea in figs.l,3 and 4,fig.2 illustrating the provision ol four grass cutting aisks 20 and of a grass conditioning assembly 30 .in that samb rig.2 there is also illustrated, by way or example, a structure 32 for directionally stiffening the structural frame to De applied to the grass cutting machine, or totating grass cutting machine,and being indicatea at 34. The aetail OI fig.3 schematically illustrates a tap 36 effective to seiectively allow for the oil to De circulated through the hydraulic circuit as It wtss thereinabove illustratea. Considering now the gear of fig.2,it comprises a lever,proviaea with a suitable handle,and the ross section thereoi has been indicated at 40 , in the alsengaged position,and at 40 , in an engaged position between suitable resilient shoes, in particular a spring blessed shoe 42 cooperating with a rigid countershoe 44.ODviously these components may De structurally and or operatively different, providea that they are suitable to assure the roll owing operation. Since in the middle power agricultural tractors a single oleodynamic pump is providea only the large weight ana power tractors being provided with two pumps , the pump has to operate both me rising assembly and the hydraulic motor operating the grass spreading rotor. As the grass cutting operation is carriea out, the operator operates the lever 4u ,40 in order to lower the rising assembly or the agricultural apparatus, and specirically,in the considerea case, ol the grass spreading apparatus. As the enu OI the alternating paths is reached, generally at the Iielu end, the operator operates the lever to put it at the starting position ana engage the rising assemDly actuating lever, according TO a well known sequence.These operations are carriea out Dy the operator who, as it is conventional, has at aisposal two adjoining controlling lever on a side o the seat 4o figs.l anu 2 therein the two adjoining controlling levers have been schema tically illustrated at the position inaicated Dy the arrow 50 . As the operator,at the ena of a portion of the alternating path, has TO curry out a reversing operation in oraer to cut the grass again, said lever is brought to the position 40 ana engagedDetween the holaing means 42,44 in oraer to operate again the hyaraulic motor M anu hence again rotate the grass spreading rotor. while the improved apparatus according to the present invention has been thereinabove illustrated ana described only oy way oz an inaicative ana not imitative example ana only to show its min characteristics, it shoula De noteu that it is susceptible to several mod cations anu variation ling within its spirit and scope,as it is defined in the accompanying claims.
