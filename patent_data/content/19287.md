## Description
DATA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM BACKGROUND OF TME.INVENTION This invention relates to digital type data communication systems. More particularly1 the present invention relates to a computer based data acquisition and control communications system operating as part of a television signal distribution network over bidirectional coaxial cable. A number of cable television systems have been developed for two way communication over coaxial cable to transmit data signals and television signals between subscriber locations and a central station. Such systems have been utilized for the control and monitoring of security systems in homes or businesses. Bidirectional cable communication systems have also proven useful in providing pay television services by monitoring the usage of the television by the subscriber and transmitting billing signals to a data processor located at a central station. Examples of such systems are disc osed in U.S Patent 3,794,922 issued to Osborn et al and U.S. Patent 3,803,491 issued to Osborn. Cable communication systems have been used in the past primarily for security monitoring and control functions and for controlling monthly subscription pay television. Recent developments in communications components and computer systems are making many additional applications technically feasible which will enable a subscriber to have a wide range of data acquisition and control uses. These applications include per view premium television which allows tlle user to select and watch premium programs such as first run movies on a pay per program basis, and user access to extensive data bases such as libraries and newspapers for tlle selective retrieval of large amounts of data to be viewed on the television screen. In addition, many electronic games can be provided from a central data base ,for home entertainment. Moreover, sophisticated monitoring systems are contemplated which will leave the capability of receiving and monitoring data from the user.These systems include rernote meter reading techniques interfacing with home and business utilities to develop composite and simple billing for the customer, and energy management systems to assist the customer and the power company in more efficiently utilizing power consumption and conserving energy. Other types of monitoring systems which are becoming feasible include opinion polling, advertising feedback, home shopping and other userservice vender interfaces. In addition, a number of business applications are contemplated such as point to point data transmission, remote control operations and traffic control communications. With the increased usage of such cable communication systems and the increased development of varied applications for such systems, the need has developed for more sophisticated and efficient data acquisition and control techniques. Most cable communication systems use some type of time multiplexing procedure in transmitting data which allows a central station to cyclically sample data from each of a number of home terminals over a fairly short period of time. This concept, called time sharing , is widely used in the computer and communications industries. SUMMARY OF llE INVENTION The present invention provides further improvements in efficiency by using frequency division multiplexing in combination with time sharing. In this approach, a number of remote terminals are keyed to respond to a given interrogation frequency frm the central processor, with each terminal responding at a different frequency. The interrogating central processor receives the signals of each responding terminal and sequentially processes the data from each signal. This approach minimizes the amount of identification data required for interrogation and time delay required for response, resulting in more efficient data transmissions. To further improve cable communication flexibility and efficiency, the present invention also utilizes space division multiplexing in combination witli frequency and time division multiplexing. In space division multiplesing, a plurality of computer controlled remote data processing systems are utilized, each controlling and monitoring a large number of user terminals by two way time and frequency multiplexed signals. In turn, the remote data systems are monitored and controllcd by a common computercontrolled central data processing system.Using this approach a separate remote data processor handles the housekeeping chores with each network of terminals, providing interrcgation and command functions as needed. Interrogation and monitoring signals are transmitted between the remote data system and the central data system only in an interrupt mode for abnormal conditions and discontinuities. Otherwise, the central data system is free to manage the communications systems and provide general data base storage and control functions to the remote data systems. In one aspect of the present invention, a communications system is provided for remote data acquisition qnd control. The communication system includes a central data processing system, a plurality of remote data processing systems in communication with the central data processing system and a plurality of remote user terminals each in communication with one of the remote data processing systems. The central data processing system comprises a first computer for processing, storing and retrieving data, and and communications unit having multiple channels for simultaneous communication with each of the remote data processing systems.Each remote data processing system comprises a second computer for processing, storing and retrieving data as well as a second communications unit for sequentially communicating with each of a group of remote user terminals by multiplexing procedures. Each of the remote user terminals includes a plurality of units for generating response data to be processed to one of the remote data processing systems, as well as a third communications unit for receiving control data from the remote data processing and for transmitting the response data to the remote data processing system. For a better understanding of the present invention together with other and further objects and features thereof, reference is made to the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings. BlUEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGURE 1 is a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the present invention FIGURE 2 is a block diagram of the central data processing system ofFIGURE l FIGURE 3 is a block diagram of the remote data processing system ofFIGURE 1 FIGURE 4 is a block diagram of the RF subsystem shown in FIGURE 3 FIGURE 5 is a block diagram of another preferred embodiment of the present invention FIGURE 6 is a flow diagram of the communication procedure between the central data processing system and the remote data processing system of FIGURE I and FIGURE 7 is a now diagram of the communication procedure between the remote data processing system and the terminal units of FIGURE 1.DETAILED DESGRIPTION OF TilE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT Referring to FIGURE 1, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. Data communications system 10 is a highly sophisticated, . .computer based, general purpose data acquisition and control system that communicates over bi directional coaxial cable in conjunction with a cable television network. The system is designed to provide a wide variety of data acquisition functions including monitoring home or business security alarm devices. The system also provides sophisticated functions for monitoring and controlling subscriber usage of the associated pay television network. In addition, system 10 has a uniform modular design enabling expansion of the system to provide additional functions such as energy management, meter reading, information retrieval, pay per view television, opinion polling, emer gency alert and so forth. As shown in FIGURE 1, system 10 includes a central data processing system CDS 12, a plurality of remote data processing systems RDS 14 20 each connected by a data link 13 to CDS 12, and a plurality of groups of terminal units 22 33 connected by a plurality of data links to an RDS 18. It is understood that the other RDS units 14,1G, 20 have similar groups of terminal units in communication therewith. CDS 12 is the central controlling unit for system 10. Its principal functions are to provide data storage and retrieval for the entire system and to monitor and control each RDS 14 20. Each RDS is preferably remotely located from CDS 12 and can communicate with the CDS by any of a number of different types of data links such as a dedicated phone line, fiber optic cables, microwave, radio frequencies or other communication means. It is important for each RDS to be located at or near the junction of the coaxial cable, callec a cable plant, in order to obtain its radio frequency signals from the cable plant. The CDS and RDS communicate in an interrupt mode whereir the RDS continually monitors and controls its terminals without assistance from the CDS. Interrupt data is transmitted to the CDS only if an abnorma condition is encountered by the RDS, thus freeing the CDS to provide overt management for the system. In coinmunicnting with RDS 18, CDS 12 can give instructions to perform specialized commands or interrogation polls of an individual terminal or groups of home terminals for meter reading or other similar functions. RDS 18 also has the capability to receive programming from CDS 12 if a specialized function is required. Each RDS 18 has a plurality of terminal units 22 33 in communication therewith by way of transmission line 19. The units are preferably arranged in a plurality of groups such as terminal units 22 24, referred to herein as group A, terminal units 25 27, referred to herein as group B, terminal units 28 30, referred to herein us group C and terminals 31 33 referred to herein as Group D. RDS 18 is designed to communicate with each of groups A, B, C and D on a cycled time sharing basis, preferably every few seconds. The terminals are polled using a standard downstream frequency and an identification number identifying at least one terminal unit in each group. Those terminal units then respond each at a different frequency depending upon the group to which they are assigned, and the RDS 18 reaas the data of each of the terminals in turn to determine and record the response of each terminal. In the security function, RDS 18 polls each terminal unit connected to it for its security status every few seconds in the polling cycle. As long as no alarm conditions are present, only monitor information is passed between the CDS 12 and RDS 18. When an alarm condition is detected by RL S 18, it reports the alarm to CDS 12 which then records the information and takes appropriate action. RDS 18 also monitors the operating condition of each terminal unit 22 33. If a terminal fails, or responds with continuous erroneous data, a monitor alarm is generated by RDS 18 and directed to CDS 12. A television program source 21 inputs commercial pay television signals to line 19 for transmission to terminal units 22 33. The television signals are normally scrambled to prevent access to the programs by unauthorized subscribers. Each home television terminal includes appropriate descrambling apparatus which is activated or deactivated by control signals from the RDS to the remote data terminal unit. Program source 21 may be any conventional head end or remote hub unit designed for receiving, converting and transmitting TV signals. In one preferred embodiment, CDS 12 is designed to communicate in parallel with eight RDS units 18, each having a configuration to communicate with eight groups of terminals. Each group preferably contains 1,000 terminal units giving cach RJ S 18 tic capability to communicate with 8,000 terminal units. The COS in this embodiment thus has the capability to monitor up to 64,000 home terminals for alarm conditions and to provide numerous data acquisition and control functions for those terminals. In a preferred embodiment, CDS 12 communicates with each RDS 14 20 by a RS 232 data link. Communication between each RDS 18 and its associated terminal units 22 is provided through a combination of time and frequency division multiplexing at RF frequencies. RDS 18 communicates downstream on a cable plant, using a frequency shift key FSK mode of modulation at a standard frequency of 158.55megahertz. The terminal units, respond on separate channels to one of eight different receivers in the RDS for each of the eight groups using an FSK mode of modulation at standard frequencies between approximately 18.2 and 30 megahertz. As an example, RDS 18 transmits at 158.55 megahertz a downstream interrogation signal requesting the status of all terminal units having an identification number of 50. Assuming each of terminal units 24, 27, 30 and 33 have that identification number for their respective groups, each unit responds over its appropriate cable line at its group frequency to one of the RDS receivers with its present status concerning the security device in question. Group A might transmit at 18.2 megahertz, group B at 18.6 megahertz, group C at 19 megahertz and group D at 19.4 megahertz. Since each group communicates at a different frequency, RDS 18 will be able to idehtify each responding terminal unit by determining the frequency of its response.Thus, by processing data in the RDS receivers from first 18.2 megahertz, second 18.6 megahertz, third 19 megahertz and finally 19.4 megahertz, RDS 18 will be able to determine the status of terminal units 24, 27, 30 and 33 with a minimum of propogation delay time. Looking now at FIGURE 2, CDS 12 comprises a computerized system having a minicomputer 50 at the center of its operations. Preferably, computer 50 is a general purpose computer having both a random access memory and o read only memory. Computer 50 is controlled by a conventional system operator console 52, a real time clock 54 and external data links 11. Minicomputer 50 is connected to magnetic storage devices 56 such as magnetic disks and magnetic tape systems for building demographic data base and system files. Minicomputer 50 also outputs to printer devices 58 such as a hard copy logger or a line printer. Output is also provided to a remote terminal 60 having similar hard copy loggers and line printers as well as other optional items. Terminal 60 may be located nt a remote station where emergencies can be readily reported such as at a fire station, police station or hospital. CDS 12 communicates with the RDS units and is informed of alarm conditions entering and elearing each RDS. When an alarm condition is detected, minicomputer 50 processes this data and provides appropriate information for the system operator console 52, magnetic storage units 56 and printer devices 58. The operator acknowledges the alarm and takes the necessary emergency action through console 52. Demographic information which has been. previously entered into the system and stored is displayed for each home terminal in an alarm condition. This data provides such information as the subscriber s name, address, medical history, and other emergency related data. In one preferred embodiment of CDS 12, minicomputer 50 comprises a rack mounted Hewlett Packard 1000 minicomputer system having standard operating systems software such that application programs may be developed for utilization with other data acquisition and control functions. These conventional software packages preferably can accommodate all terminal devices so that, for example, a meter reading package can be constructed allowing the gathering of data from the terminal units through the appropriate RDS for processing by minicomputer 50 and recording on the appropriate magnetic storage devices 56 and printer devices 58. Looking now at FIGURE 3, remote data processing system 18 is shown in greater detail. A microcomputer 70 is connected by data link 13 to minicomputer 50 of CDS 12. Magnetic storage devices 72 record and provide data concerning the terminal units associated with RDS 18. Printer unit 74 and display unit 76 provide the appropriate output channels for communicating onsite information concerning the status of the terminal units. A radio frequency subsystem 80 is connected between microcomputer 70 and data link 19 to the terminal units to communicate in the appropriate radio frequencies along the coaxial cables. RDS 18 is designed to automatically poll its associated terminal units sequentially. When an alarm signal is received, the alarm data is processed by microcomputer 70 and data is provided to printer 74 to record the type of alarm, time of day and demographic data corresponding to the terminal in question. In one preferred embodiment, microcomputer 70 comprises aZilog Z80 MCS micro computer system having a capacity of up to 64K bytes of semiconductor memory and two integral floppy disle drives. Standard software is provided including programmed read only memory systems. Printer units 74 include a hard copy alarm logger, and display unit 76 comprises a cathode ray tube unit. In the preferred embodiment, RF subsystem 80 comprises a frequency shift key transmitter receiver circuit shown in FIGURE 4. for providing frequency modulated data along cable 19 to the terminal units. Although not shown, each terminal unit comprises a home terminal system having a plurality of sensors and alarm devices connected in parallel thereto. Preferably the remote terminal unit is one of the HT 3 systems made by Tocom, Inc. of Dallas, Texas. The alarm devices and sensor equipment are normally conventional items for the detection of fire, medical emergency, intrusion, assault, supervisor fault, tamper and battery low condition, all readily available in the marketplace. The computer based capabilities of the CDS 12 and RDS units 14 . 20 of the present invention provide the flexibility to accommodate in the same terminal group a variety of terminal units having different intelligence levels. f A fairly simple type of terminal unit operates passively to routinely respond to cyclical interrogations by the RDS. A more sophisticated and intelligent terminal, described in our co pending patent application, Serial No. takes takes upon itself most of the monitoring functions and only interrupts the RDS when an abnormal condition occurs. Looking now at FIGURE 4, RF subsystem 80 of RDS 18 is shown in greater detail. Subsystem 80 is comprised of two main parts a transmitter portion and a receiver portion. In the transmitter section, data is received frotn the RDS microcomputer 70 along data bus 78 to an FSK transmitter 82. which codes the data in a frequency shift key mode, preferably at the base frequency of 158.55 megahertz. Transmitter. 82 then feeds the signal to a passband filter 84 to remove any undesirable harmonics. The signal is then fecj to a diplexer 8G which outputs the signal for transmission on a coaxial cable lc to the terminal unit. The receiver section of RF subsystem 80 comprises a passband preamplifier splitter 88 connected to receive signals through diplexer 86 fro the terminal units on cable 19 at the response frequencies previous mentioned. Splitter 88 separates the frequencies of the terminal response datt and directs each frequency to a frequency shift key receiver for the group c terminals operating at that frequency. To use the previously mentioned example, the signal responses at 18.2 megahertz are 1passed to an FSK receiver 90 for the group A terminals.Terminal responses at 18.6 megahertz are transmitted to FSK receiver 92 for the group B terminals, responses transmitted at 19 megahertz are passed to FSK receiver 94 for group C terminals and responses at 19.4 megahertz from the group D terminals are passed to FSK receiver 9G. Each one of receivers 90 96 convert the terminal response data from the frequency shift key mode to a digital mode for transmission along data bus 78 to microcumputer 70 of RDS 18. Although not shown, it is understood that transmitter 82, preamplifier splitter 88 and receivers 90 96 are powered by a conventional DC power supply which in turn is powered by a 120 volt AC source. It should now be appreciated that the system of the present invention is highly versatile for utilization with cable television distribution systems. The central data system and its corresponding remote data systems may be combined with one or more different types of cable TV networks in entirely different locations and having different transmission means and network configurations. The main limitation is that the remote data system must be located near the cable plant to communicate at RF frequencies with the terminal units. The central data system may be placed remotely at any desired location and may utilize any one of a number of different types of data links with the remote data systems as previously mentioned. With reference to FIGURE 5, one possible configuration is shown of the relationship between the data acquisition and control system of the present invention and one or more television program sources. As shown therein, a CDS unit 100 communicates with RDS units 102, 104, 106 and 108. A television program source ll0i sometimes called a main head end, receives television signals on antenna 112 and transmits the signals to three remote hub stations 112, 114 and 116 for further processing of the television channel data. Communication between CDS 100 and RDS 102 is by way of a separate line 120 which may be a dedicated telephone line or other separate communication link.Communication with RDS 104 and 106 takes place along a common transmission line 112, since it is assumed that both are in relatively close proximity to each other. Data is transmitted to RDS 108 over a separate line 124 which again may be a dedicated telephone line, a microwave transmission or some other dedicated communication means. In tie example shown, television program source 110 feeds remote hubs 112, 114 and 116 along a common transmission line 130, preferably coaxial cable. Output signals from hubs 112, 114 and ll6 are directed to conventional signal splitters 132, 134 and 136, respectively. Likewise, the outputs of RDS units 102,104 and 106 are fed to splitter units 132, 134 and 136 to provide the necessary control functions for the remote terminal units to access the television signals from the associated remote hub units. Thus, a fairly large television program network involving a main head end and severaI remote hubs may be controlled by a central CDS and remotely located RDS units which link up with the CDS unit in whatever way may be convenient. A separate TV program source 140 may be located in a remote television area and may receive substantially different programming over antenna 142. Nevertheless, the TV programming may be incorporated in the same data acquisition and control network by utilizing RDS 108 communicating with CDS 100 over a dedicated line 124. As with the other remote locations, the outputs of TV program source 140 and RDS 108 are fed to a signal splitter 142 which in turn directs the program signal and the RDS control data to the associated remote terminals. Thus, the data acquisition and control system of the present invention has the capability of controlling widely separated cable television networks which may have no interconnection or relationship utith each other. Referring now to FIGURE 6, a flow diagram is shown describing the basic monitoring procedures of the central data system by which it controls and monitors its associated remote data systems. These procedures are carried out by the operation of the program software in minicomputer 50 of central data system 12. The monitoring procedure is begun by setting ìn RDS parameterX equal to one and then requesting the status of RDS X. If the status is normal and no attention is required by the CDS, it increments RDS X by one and determines whether the new X parameter is equal to nine. If not, the status of the RDS designated by the new RDS parameter is requested. If X is equal to nine, it is reset to one so that the sequential monitoring of the RDS units can begin again. If the RDS status being monitored is determined to be abnormal, the CDS requests additional data from the IlDS in question. The KDS then feeds the data concerning the abnormal condition to the CDS and a determination is made as to whether the data is related to a terminal security problem. If so, the CDS determines the alarm type and accesses demographic data from its own magnetic storage files to describe the alarm. type and location. The appropriate alarm signals are then output to the operator.If the data is not related to a terminal security problem, inquiry is made as to whether the data may be related to a pay television 1procedure. If so, the CDS logs the pay channel being watched as well as the group and identification numbers and the day and time of subscriber usage. If not, a test is made to determine whether the data is related to any other acquisition or control function programmed into the CDS. Since the system is generalized, the types of functions which may be programmed into the CDS are innumerable.This flexibility is represented by the next step in the flow diagram indicating a test to determine whether the data from the RDS is related to whatever special function may be programmed in the system. if so, that function is processed and if not the signal is checked for data error and the operator is warned of some data which cannot be related to the CDS programming. After each data process has been completed, the CDS returns to the beginning of the program and the RDS parameter X is incremented by one to start the procedure again. Looking now at FIGURE 7, a similar flow diagram is shown to describe the procedure by which each RDS monitors its remqte terminal units.It is understood that this procedure is embodied in the software of microcomputer 70 of each of RDS units 14 20. Referring to the preferred embodiment previously mentioned, there are 1,000 remote terminal units having identification numbers zero through 999 in each of eight groups having group numbers one through eight. Thus, there are 8,000 terminal units associated with each of the remote data systems. To start, an identification parameter X is assigned a zero value and each terminal unit having an ID of zero is polled. The RDS then collects data from each responding terminal in its appropriate receiver sections as previously described.A group parameter Y is set at one and data corresponding to the terminal response having that group parameter is. read from the appropriate receiver into microcomputer 70. A test is made to determine whether the data is the same as the last time this unit was polled. If so, the group parameter Y is incremented by one and a determination is made as to whether Y is equal to nine. If so, all eight groups have been monitored so that the identification code can be incremented by one and the routine begun again. If the data is not the same as the last time the unit was polled, a check is made by the ElDS to determine whether there may be errors in the data. If a determination is made that the data is definitely different, the new and old data from the terminal in question is communicated to the CDS for appropriate action. If the data is determined not to be different, adata error has been encountered and the CDS is notified of that problem. In either case, the routine is then directed back to the stage where the group parameter Y is incremented by one and a test is made to determine whether Y is equal to nine. If so, the identification code is incremented by one and the next set of terminals having that identification code are polled. Prior to polling the next group of terminals, a determination is made as to whether the identification parameter has reached 1,000. If so, a check is made to determine whether the CDS requires any special operations to be performed. If special operations are required, the appropriate CDS program is obtained and run by the RDS to provide the desired commands and functions for the remote terminals The procedure is then returned to the starting point with the identification code set at zero so that all of the terminals may be again monitored. While there have been described what are at present considered to be preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the invention, and it is therefore intended to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the spirit and scope of the invention. What is claimed is
