## Description
The present invention relates to a method for removal of the N terminal methionine from methionyl proteins. When a protein is biosynthesized within a cell, its amino terminus is always occupied by methionine formylmethionine in case of procaryotes , which corresponds to the mRNA initiation codon, i.e. AUG. In produced mature protein molecules, however, such methionine is usually no longer present, because it is removed via subsequent processing. On the other hand, recent rapid progress in gene recombination technology has made it possible to produce useful proteins using microbes or animal cells, e.g. It can be conjectured that three dimensional structure, bioactivity and stability can differ between a molecule with methionine at its amino terminus and one without methionine, even though they be molecules of the same protein addition of methionine at the amino terminus is thought of possibly causing an increase in protein antigenicity. Therefore, it would be signifi cant, in terms of industrial application, to establish a method of removing such amino terminal methionine. In order to dissolve this problem, a process was suggested by which methionine could be removed by cyanogen bromide BrCN cleavage Science, PCT International Publication No. W084 02351 discloses a method for producing a mature protein in which fused protein having a pre sequence or codon sequence composed of two or more amino acids is decomposed by aminopeptidase however, this method cannot cleave amino terminal methionine alone and thus cannot achieve the purpose stated above. The present inventors, after studying how to produce polypeptide possessing an amino acid sequence equaling that of natural polypeptide by cleaving amino terminal methionine alone from polypeptide synthesized by gene engineering techniques, found that amino terminal methionine alone can be cleaved specifically from some kinds of polypeptides by causing a reaction, using aminopeptidase, to those polypeptides. The finding was followed by further research, leading to the completion of the invention. The present invention is concerned with a method for removal of the N terminal methionine from a methionyl protein represented by the formula H Met X Pro Y OH I wherein X is an amino acid other than proline, Y is a peptide chain, which comprises reacting the methionyl protein I with aminopeptidase to give a protein represented by the formula H X Pro Y OH II wherein X and Y have the same meanings as defined above. Amino acids which is defined by X in the formula I include all amino acids other than Pro. The examples of the amino acids are essential amino acids, e.g. Ala, Phe, Arg, Thr, Ile, Gln, Ser, Gly and Leu. Ala, Phe, Arg and Thr are especially preferable among others. Peptide chains which are defined by Y include any peptides composed of 2 or more amino acids and posses sing an arbitrary amino acid number, preferably less than about 400. Preferable molecular weight for the said peptide chain is about 200 to 50,000. From the practical point of view, the use of peptide chain of about 20 to 200 amino acid number or of about 200 to 36,000 molecular weight is recommended such peptide chain include those corresponding to Y in polypeptide produced via gene engineering techniques or peptide produced via chemical synthesis. Polypeptides represented by the formula II , produced by the present method, include, for example, the following lymphokines such as human interleukin 2 human IL 2 hormones such as growth hormone, e.g. human growth hormone, horse growth hormone, bovine prolactin, bovine pancreatic hormone and chicken pancreatic hormone enzyme inhibitors such as bovine basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and dog submandibular protease inhibitor substance P blood proteins such as human blood plasma albumin In the present specification, polypeptides include all peptides and proteins composed of two or more amino acids, whether glycosylated or non gylcosylated. Among Polypeptide II , human interleukin 2 and human growth hormone are preferable. Said human interleukin 2 includes all substances possessing biological or immunological activities similar to those of natural human interleukin 2, e.g. binding activity with interleukin 2 receptor or anti interleukin 2 antibody specifically, polypeptides possessing an amino acid sequence as shown in Fig. 1 their fragments composed of a partial amino acid sequence essential to their biological or immunological activity are included, e.g. a fragment lacking one amino acid at the amino terminus European Patent Application Publication No. 91539 , a fragment lacking four amino acids at the amino terminus Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 126088 1985 , fragments lacking several amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. Also included are polypeptides possessing an amino acid sequence as shown in Fig. 1 in which some amino acids are lost or replaced by other amino acids, e.g. those in which the No.125 cysteine residue is replaced by a serine residue U.S. Patent No. 4,518,584 . Aminopeptidases which can be used include known peptidases, e.g. aminopeptidases M EC 3.4.11.2 Methods in Enzymology, Among the aminopeptidases, amionpeptidase M is preferable. When human IL 2 in the form of Polypeptide II is to be produced by the present method, using as a starting material human IL 2 possessing an H Met Ala Pro fragment at its amino terminus in the form of Polypeptide I , the use of aminopeptidase M as an aminopeptidase is especially preferable. In the present invention, Polypeptide II is produced by subjecting Polypeptide I to a reaction with aminopeptidase. Polypeptide I to be used as a starting material includes both purified products and partially purified products obtained during the purification process the concomitance of Polypeptide II is permitted. It is recommended that Polypeptide I be a nonglycosylated polypeptide. The use of a buffer solution in the reaction is recommended buffer solutions which is used include all those composed of an inorganic base e.g. sodium, potassium, ammonium salt of an organic e.g. acetic or inorganic e.g. phosphoric acid and a solvent, as long as they do not inhibit said enzyme reaction. Reaction pH is in the range of about 4 to 10 from the point of view of stability of both enzyme and polypeptide, a pH range of about 6 to 9 is especially preferable. Reaction time ranges from about 1 to 100 hours. Reaction temperature ranges from about 4 to 70 C, preferably between about 15 C and 70 C, more preferably between about 30 C and 50 C is recommended. The ratio of aminopeptidase to Polypeptide I as a substrate ranges from about 1 1,000 to 1 1 molar ratio from the point of view of yield, reaction time and cost, however, a molar ratio of about 1 100 to 1 5 is preferable. Where an available aminopeptidase is used which is mingled with dipeptidase, prolidase etc., it is recommended that the mingling enzymes be separated by ordinary methods such as chromatography or that their activity be inhibited by adding inhibitors such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate DFP and p chloromercuribenzoic acid PCMB , or that the aminopeptidase be treated by a combination of both methods. In the present method, prior to use in the reaction, aminopeptidase may be immobilized with a carrier. Carriers which are used in immobilization include any compounds which can combine with aminopeptidase water insoluble polymers possessing high affinity are especially favorable. Such polymers include homopolymers such as cellulose, its derivatives, crosslinked dextran, its derivatives, agarose, its derivatives, polyacrylamide, and copolymers such as agarose polyacrylamide copolymer. The covalent bond combination of aminopeptidase and a carrier may be achieved by combining them either directly or via a spacer. In direct combination, the carrier is activated beforehand so that it combines with the aminopeptidase a method using a halogenated cyanogen such as cyanogen bromide is effective. In spacer mediating combination, the spacer is incorporated into a carrier beforehand aminopeptidase and spacer incorporating carrier may be combined using water soluble carbodiimides such as 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide. Spacers used include compounds expressed by the formulas H₂N CH₂ To combine a carrier and aminopeptidase via covalent bonds, an activated carrier or a carrier to which an active group has been incorporated and aminopeptidase are subjected to coupling reaction under the following conditions. These are mixed together at a pH of about 2 to 12 preferably about 3 to 11 and at a temperature of about 0 to 50 C preferably about 4 to 30 C and then stirred slowly for about 10 minutes to 24 hours preferably about 2 to 16 hours some salts e.g. NaCl, Na₂HPO₄, etc. which do not inhibit the reaction may be added to prevent the non specific ionic adsorption of aminopeptidase to the carrier. The resulting gel is collected via filtration or centrifugation. After the remaining active groups are blocked with primary amine such as glycine or ethylamine, the collected gel is rinsed well with phosphoric acid buffer solution etc. to yield a carrier bound with aminopeptidase, i.e. immobilized aminopeptidase. Immobilized aminopeptidase can be used almost in the same manner as simple aminopeptidase for example, Polypeptide I , to be used as a starting material includes both purified and partially purified products obtained during the purification process. The use of a buffer solution is recommended those which can be used include all composed of a sodium, potassium or ammonium salt of acids such as phosphoric, acetic and boric, as long as they do not inhibit the enzyme reaction. Reaction pH ranges from about 4 to 10 from the point of view of polypeptide stability, however, a pH range of about 6 to 9 is especially preferable. Reaction time ranges from about 1 to 200 hours, preferably from about 1 to 100 hours, reaction temperature from about 4 to 70 C, preferably from about 15 to 70 C, more preferably from about 30 to 50 C it is recommended however that the reaction is carried out between about 4 C and 10 C, when the immobilized enzyme is repeatedly used. Reaction progress can be monitored by analyzing some of the reactant liquid using methods based on the difference in isoelectric point, e.g. fast protein liquid chromatography FPLC . Products can be identified by N terminal sequencing or amino acid analysis. Reaction products can be purified via the conventional methods of purifying protein or peptide e.g. extraction, salting out, distribution, recry stallization and chromatography, if required. Polypeptide II , produced by the present method, does not have Met at its amino terminus and possesses the same amino acid sequence as natural bioactive polypeptide. Therefore, it exhibits an activity equal to that of natural polypeptide and its toxicity is low it can therefore be used safely as a drug and a diagnosis reagent. The present invention provides a method for removal of the N terminal methionine from methionylprotein in specifically. When the aminopeptidase is employed as an immobilized form, the enzyme is used repeatedly, and therefore the method is in efficiency. In the specification, claims and drawings of the present invention, amino acid abbreviations are based on those recommended by the IUPAC IUB Commission on Bio chemical Nomenclature, or those used commonly in the related field.

Figures 2 and 3 show the results obtained by FPLC and SDS PAGE respec tively the analysis procedures are described in Example 1. Figures 4 and 5 show the structural diagrams of plasmid pTF1 and plasmid pTB285 respectively, both of which are described in Reference Example 2 i . The present invention is hereinafter more concretely described with Example and Reference Examples, but should not be limited to these. The transformant employed in the Reference Example 2, i.e. The transformant The bioactivity of interleukin 2 was measured in accordance with the method of Hinuma et al. in which interleuking 2 dependent cells are used Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, In the following Examples and Reference Examples, human IL 2 produced by gene engineering techniques and having an H Met Ala Pro fragment at its amino terminus polypeptide possessing an amino acid sequence as shown in Fig. 1 and having methionine at its amino terminus is abbreviated to Met rIL 2, and that having an H Ala Pro fragment at its amino terminus polypeptide represented by the amino acid sequence shown in Fig. 1 to rIL 2. First, 4.2 mg of Met rIL 2 obtained in Reference Example 2 vii was reacted with 0.17 mg of aminopeptidase M treated with DFP and PCMB Journal of Biochemistry, IN FPLC, both a time dependent decrease in Peak 2 fraction content, i.e. Met rIL 2 content, and a time dependent increase in Peak 1 fraction newly appearing content were observed, as shown in Figure 2. The conversion rate of Peak 2 to Peak 1 at 20 hours after reaction initiation was approx. 40 . Peak 1 and Peak 2 fractions were then recovered by FPLC using 1.9 ml of a reaction liquid sampled by 20 hours after reaction initiation to prove the newly appearing Peak 1 fraction to be rIL 2 and the Peak 2 fraction to be the remaining Met rIL 2. Each recovered fraction was then subjected to high performance liquid chromatography HPLC , using a tri fluoroacetic acid acetonitrile system as an elution solvent to remove the polybuffer used in FPLC. The following conditions were employed Next, P1 and P2 were subjected to protein chemical analysis. Using 21 µg 1.4 nmole of P1 and 26 µg 1.7 nmole of P2 as samples, the amino terminal amino acid sequences of P1 and P2 were determined via automatic Edman degradation using a gas phase protein sequencer Applied Biosystems, 470A model . Phenylthiohydantoin amino acids PTH amino acids were identified via HPLC using a Micropac SP C18 column Varian . PTH amino acids detected at each step are shown in Table 2. Carboxyl terminal analysis was conducted as follows. P1 and P2 were introduced into separate glass tubes for hydrazinolysis anhydrous hydrazine was added. The glass tube was sealed under reduced pressure and heated at 100 C for 6 hours. The resulting hydrazinolysis product, after benzaldehyde treatment, was subjected to free amino acid analysis using a HITACHI 835 model amino acid analyzer. Only threonine was detected in P1 and P2 yields were 51.0 and 48.0 respectively. Based on this fact, the carboxyl terminal amino acids of P1 and P2 were both identified as threonine. Amino acid composition was analyzed as follows. Each sample was put into a glass tube constant boiling hydrochloric acid containing 4 thioglycolic acid was added. The glass tube was sealed under reduced pressure and hydrolyzed at 110 C for 24, 48, or 72 hours. Each of the resulting hydrolyzates was analyzed using a HITACHI 835 model amino acid analyzer after oxidation with performic acid, cystine and cysteine were hydrolyzed in constant boiling hydrochloric acid under reduced pressure for 24 hours and then quantified as cysteic acid, using an amino acid analyzer. Analysis values were calculated by averaging data obtained after hydrolysis for 24, 48 and 72 hours however, the values for serine and threonine were extrapolated on the assumption that hydrolysis time was 0 hours. The results are shown in Table 3. The homogeneities of P1 and P2 were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in accordance with the method of Laemmli Nature, The IL 2 activities of P1 and P2 were next determined in accordance with the method of Hinuma et al. Bilchem. Biophys. Res. Commun., The same reaction was conducted using an amount of 5 times of DFP PCMB treated aminopeptidase M to Met rIL 2 the reaction progress was monitored by FPLC and free methionine analysis. Free methionine was detected at ratios of 0.17, 0.29, 0.69, and 0.98 mole mole Met rIL 2 at 2, 5, 20 and 44 hours after reaction initiation rIL 2 peak heights corresponding to the quantities of methionine were observed in FPLC. Thus it can be affirmed that Met rIL 2 can be converted to rIL 2 almost completely by raising the ratio of enzyme to Met rIL 2. 1.0 ml of 0.05M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 containing 1.05 mg of Met rIL 2 obtained in Reference Example 2 vii was added to 0.5 ml aminopeptidase M Cellulofine obtained in Reference Example 1 for reaction at 37 C for 4 hours with stirring. After the reaction was completed, the reaction liquid was eluted from the column and recovered fully from the column using 1 ml of 0.05M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 . The recovered reaction liquid was subjected to free amino acid analysis and FPLC in accordance with the methods described in Example 1. Free methionine was detected at a ratio of 0.1 mole mole Met rIL 2 in amino acid analysis, rIL 2 production being observed in FPLC. The conversion rate from Met rIL 2 to rIL 2 was drastically increased by employing a large amount of aminopeptidase M Cellulofine or a long time reaction. Namely, 10 mg of Met rIL 2 dissolved in 6 ml of 5 mM ammonium acetate pH 6.0 were added to 10 ml of aminopeptidase M Cellulofine. The reaction was carried out at 30 C for 40 hours with stirring. In FPLC the reaction liquid gave a peak at the position of the elution of rIL 2, and the conversion rate was about 50 calculated from the area ratio. In order to confirm that the peak was really derived from rIL 2, the fraction of this peak was recovered, and polybuffer was removed from the sample by HPLC using Ultrapore RPSC column, and then the fraction was subjected to protein chemical analysis in accordance with the methods described in Example 1. The amino terminal amino acid sequence up to five cycles was Ala Pro Thr Ser Ser , and amino acid composition was in good agreement with the values of the composition deduced from the cDNA base sequence. The specific activity was 34400 U mg. These results show that Met rIL 2 is converted to rIL 2 by reacting Met rIL 2 with aminopeptidase M Cellulofine. Said aminopeptidase M Cellulofine was able to be used repeatedly, for example, for about 30 times, and in this repeat use the conversion rate was not decreased. To 1.5 ml of aminopeptidase M Affi Gel 15 obtained in Reference Example 3 was added 1.0 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 containing 1.05 mg of Met rIL 2 obtained in Reference Example 2 vii . The reaction was carried out at 37 C for 4 hours with stirring. The reaction mixture was eluted from the column and reaction liquid was recovered fully from the column using 1 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 . The recovered solution was subjected to amino acid analysis and FPLC in accordance with the methods described in Example 1. Free methionine was detected at a rate of 0.05 mole mole of Met rIL 2 in amino acid analysis. In FPLC a peak corresponding to rIL 2 was observed. To 1.0 ml of aminopeptidase M agarose 0.5 U ml of the gel, manufactured by Pierce Chemical Co. Illinois, U.S.A. was added 1.0 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 containing 1.05 mg of Met rIL 2 obtained in Reference Example 2 vii . The reaction was carried out at 37 C for 4 hours with stirring. The reaction mixture was eluted from the column and the reaction liquid was recovered fully from the column using 1 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 . The recovered solution was subjected to amino acid analysis on free amino acid and to FPLC in accordance with the methods described in Example 1. Free methionine was detected at a rate of 0.05 mole mole of Met rIL 2 in amino acid analysis. In FPLC a peak corresponding to rIL 2 was observed. 1.0 mg of Met rhGH obtained in Reference Example 4 was mixed with 38 µg of aminopeptidase M treated with DFP and PCMB in 1.0 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 , and the reaction was carried out at 37 C. 0.2 ml each of samples were collected from the reaction liquid after 0, 5, 24 and 48 hours free amino acids in the reaction liquid were analyzed in the manner of Example 1. As shown in Table 4, a time dependent increase was observed in the methionine content of the reaction liquid. rhGH recombinant human growth hormone Free amino acids other than methionine were not observed. The reaction mixture of 44 hours re action was applied to FPLC equipped with Mono P column Pharmacia . In addition to Met rhGH peak, a peak assumed to be rhGH was observed. This peak fraction was pooled and subjected to protein chemical analysis in accordance with the method described in Example 1. The amino terminal amino acid sequence was deter mined to be Phe Pro , and the carboxy terminal amino acid was determined to be Phe. The amino acid com position was in good agreement with the values of the amino acid composition deduced from the cDNA base sequence of hGH. This result shows that Met rhGH is converted to rhGH by cleaving the amino terminal methionine alone in the reaction of Met rhGH with aminopeptidase M treated with DFP and PCMB. 1.1 mg of Met rhGH obtained in Reference Example 4, dissolved in 2 ml of 0.01 M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 were added to 3 ml of aminopeptidase M Cellulofine. The reaction was carried out at 30 C with stirring. 0.2 ml each of samples were collected from the reaction liquid after 0, 24, and 48 hours free amino acids in the reaction liquid were analyzed by amino acid analizer. The results showed that free methionine was detected at a rate of 9 and 12 after 24 and 48 hours respectively, and free amino acids other than methionine were not observed. The above facts prove that Met rhGH is converted to rhGH by cleaving the amino terminal methionine alone in the reaction of Met rhGh with aminopeptidase M Cellulofine. 0.51 mg of aminopeptidase M was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.2M phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0 and 1 ml of Formyl Cellulofine Seikagaku Kogyo, Japan a cellulose derivative , previously rinsed with distilled water and a 0.2M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 on a glass filter, was added. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. Next, 20 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride was added reaction was carried out at 4 C for 20 hours with stirring. After the reaction, the gel was subjected to glass filtration and washed with 0.1M phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0. The gel was then put into 1 ml of 0.05M monoethanolamine hydrochloride solution, pH 8.0, and reacted at 4 C for 3 hours, when it was again subjected to glass filtration and washed with a 0.1M phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0, yielding 0.6 ml of aminopeptidase M Cellulofine. Protein content of the filtrate and the washings, after dialysis, were determined using a protein assay kit available from BIO RAD Laboratories bovine serum albumin was used as the standard protein. The binding ratio of aminopeptidase M to Formyl Cellulofine was found to be 65 the quantity of aminopeptidase M bound with 1 ml of gel was proved to be 0.55 mg. Using the hydrolysis activity of alanyl p nitroanilide as a standard, the enzyme activity of aminopeptidase M Cellulofine was measured in accordance with a method described in Methods in Enzymology, A 1294bp DNA fragment was cleaved from a human IL 2 gene containing plasmid pILOT 135 8 Refer to Example 1 vii of the specification of Japanese Patent Application No. 225079 1983 filed on November 28, 1983 which corresponds to European Patent Application Publication No. 145,390 with restriction enzyme Using T4 DNA ligase, the resulting DNA fragment was inserted into plasmid ptrp781 Nucleic Acids Research, Using restriction enzyme Using the pTB285 plasmid obtained above, A transformant Twenty grams of the frozen cell sample was uniformly suspended in 100 ml of an extraction solvent pH 7.0 containing 7M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1M Tris HCI, and stirred at 4 C for 1 hour. The resulting suspension was then centrifuged at 28,000 x g for 20 minutes, yielding a supernatant. The resulting supernatant, after dialyzation against a 0.01M Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.5 , was centrifuged at 19,000 x g for 10 minutes, again yielding a supernatant. The resulting supernatant was passed through a 50 ml column packed with DE52 DEAE cellulose, Wattman, UK equilibrated with a 0.01M Tris HCl buffer pH 8.5 to adsorb protein IL 2 was then eluted using a NaCl concentration linear gradient 0 0.15M NaCl, 1 ℓ , yielding an active fraction. After concentrated to 5 ml using a YM 5 membrane Amicon, USA , the active fraction obtained above was subjected to gel filtration using a column 500 ml capacity packed with Sephacryl S 200 Pharmacia, Sweden previously equilibrated with a 0.1M Tris HCl pH 8.0 1M NaCl buffer. Forty milliliters of the resulting active fraction was concentrated to 3 ml using a YM 5 membrane. The resulting concentrate was adsorbed in an Ultrapore RPSC column Altex, USA and subjected to HPLC using a trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile system as eluent. The following conditions were maintained. 0.5 ml of a 0.005M ammonium acetate buffer containing the mixutre obtained above pH 5.0, protein concentration 1.03 mg ml was adsorbed on an SP 5PW column for HPLC 0.75 x 7.5 cm, Toyo Soda, Japan equilibrated with a 0.025M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.4 to elute protein. Column temperature and flow rate were maintained at 35 C and 0.5 ml min. respectively. A varian 5,500 model liquid chromatograph was used. Non glycosylyzed interleukin 2 eluted in the form of two peaks Peak A and Peak B . Each peak was subjected to amino terminal analysis revealing that Peak A and Peak B contains Met rIL 2 respectively at a purity of over 99.5 . Peak A fraction was lyophilized, yielding a white powder. 1 ml of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate containing 0.49 mg of aminopeptidase M was added to 1 ml of Affi Gel 15 Bio Rad Labs., U.S.A. derivative of agarose , previ ously rinsed with cold distilled water. The reaction was carried out at 4 C for 5 hours with stirring. After the reaction, the resultant gels were recovered on glass filter and washed with 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate pH 8.1 .
