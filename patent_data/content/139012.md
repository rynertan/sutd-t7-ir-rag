# CUTTING APPARATUS FOR WELDING MACHINE.

## Abstract
A cutting apparatus for a welding machine cuts the corresponding end portion of a preceding member which will be welded and that of a following member before the two members are welded to each other. A shearing frame 19 is formed substantially in a C shape, and is constructed so that portions thereof defining an opening therebetween can be connected by connecting mechanisms 21 , 25 to close the opening. During cutting, the opening is closed so that the shearing frame 19 self receives the reaction force due to the cutting, thereby enabling a reduction in both the size and weight of the apparatus. When the shearing frame is moved horizontally, the connecting mechanisms are disen gaged from each other to open the opening and allow the member which is to be welded to pass therethrough.
