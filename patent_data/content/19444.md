## Description
MEDICAL OR VETERINARY EQUIPMENT This invention relates to medical or veterinary equipment and in particular to equipment for determining the respbnse of an an animal body to applied stimulus. It has previously been shown that entrainment of the thermoregulatory control system of the human body can take place.When used herein the term entrainment refers to the ability of a control system of an animal body to respond to an appropriate externa fffor stimulus ulus, forinstance a thermal stimulus in the case of the thermoregulatory control system. The entrainment of the body temperature control mechanism has been shown by measuring the blood flow signal over a period during which a subject placed one hand alternately at regular intervals in two buckets of water which were at different temperatures. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for determining the response of an animal body to periodic application of an external stimulus, the apparatus comprising means for applying alternating hot and cold gas to at least a part of the animal body, means for presenting a periodic signal generated by the animal body, and detected during the application of said hot and cold gas, in a form suitable for assessing the response of said signal to said application of alternatir. hot and cold air. The apparatus may include means for measuring said periodic signal. A0OOr ln l , apparatus in accordance with the present invention dces rov require any movement by the subject, whether a human or non human animal subject. Preferably the means for presenting the periodic signal include meansIf r aecurately recording the intervals between characteristic repeat portions of the signal and means for analysing t results obtained to isolate the contribution to the signal provided by the thermoregulatory control mechanism.Preferably the analysis is by means of Fourier transform techniques By such techniques it is possible to obtain the required informtion regarding the efficiency of entrainment from the cardiac rate variability as from the peripheral blood flow signal. Preferably the gas is air and it is applied to a limb of the animal, such as an arm or leg. The animal may be human or nonhuman, such as a horse. The present invention also provides a method for determining the response of an animal body to periodic application of an external stimulus, the method comprising applying alternating hot and cold gas to at least a part of the animal body, detecting a periodic signal generated by the animal body during the application of said alternating hot and cold air, and presenting the detected periodic signal in a form suitable for assessment of the response of said signal to said application of alternating hot and cold air. Appropriate periodic body signals may be obtained from one or more of the following 1 The electrocardiogram E.C.G. 2 The blood flow through the peripheral circulation leisured by a plethysmograph usually on a finger or ear lobe 3 Elood oressure signals from either a transducer in a bloc vessel or a plethysmograph 4 The intercranial pressure I.C.P. measured by inserting a pressure transducer extra durally or attached to a catheter in the ventricle 5 Blood flow fron a continuous gated dourer device 6 Respiration rate measured by either a thyristor in the nose or a strain gauge around the chest or abdomen. All the above signals contain similar information, with the exception of the respiration rate signal which contains only part of the information derivable from the other signals, and the signals may be analysed by several techniques. Measurement of at least pone signal, preferably two or three, should ensure that the information is obtained. Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings illustrates the irregularity of the interval between heart beats of a human at rest. Figure 1A shows the E.C.G. trace, the time intervals between beats being expressed by Tn, TTn 1 Tun 2 etc. Figure 1B is similar to Figure 1A but with the individual beats reduced to a single line. The interbeat interval is usually referred to as the RR interval which is in fact the interval between one R wave and the next, the R wave referring to the largest peak in the electrocardiograph pattern. Figure 1C shows a wave form constructed from Figure 1B in which the amplitude of a particular line beat is proportional to the interval between that beat and the preceding beat.Such an interpolated wave form may be analysed using fast Fourier transform techniques to provide an analysis of the irregular heart beat intervals such as is shown in Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings. Various methods for interpolating the heart beat signal intervals have been described by Luozak et al Luczak H. and Laurig, W. 1973 , An Analysis of Heart Rate Variability et al Ergonomics, 16 1 pp 85 97 and Chess Chess, C.F., Tam,R.M.K. and Calaresu, F.R. 1975 , Influence of Cardiac NeuralInputs on Rhythmic Variations of Heart Period in the Cat. Journal of Physiology, 28 3 , pp 775 780 . The analysis of such an interpolated wave form is described by Galloway et al Galloway, D.F. and Womack, B.F. 1969 , An Application of Spectral Analysis and Digital Filtering to the Study of Respiratory SinusArrhythmia.Electronic Research Centre, University of Texas,Austin Technology Report 71, pp 11 47 . Alternatively, a signal average or autocorrelator can be used for one signal to give the spectrum. Similarly the cross spectrum of two signals can be found from the cross correlation of the signals.Other techniques that can be used are a digital statistical signal analyser and tracking filters. Referring again to the example of an analysed signal shown in Figure 2, the first peak, which occurs in the region 0.03 0.05 corresponds thermal the bodythermalcontrol mechanism, the second peak at 0.09 0.11 Hz to the blood pressure control frequency referred to as the Traube Hering wave or the Mayer wave, and the third peak to the respiration frequency in a subject at rest. However, there are often several subsidiary peaks that can be attributed to harmonics or irregular breathing which can occur during stress. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of examples only, and with reference to the remainingFigures of the accompanying drawings. Referring to Figure 3 of the drawings, a first embodiment of apparatus in accordance with the present invention includes means for applying alternating hot and cold air to the limb of a subject, these means being shown diagrammatically in Figure 3. The equipment includes means not shown for supplying air at constant pressure, flow and temperature, indicated by arrow 1 to piping and valve system 3 where it is alternately heated and cooled by switching through either the heating device 5 or the cooling device 7. Heating device 5 comprises a chamber 9 containing an electrical heater 11. By controlling the power to the heater the gas emerging from chamber 9 has a constant warm temperature. The power to the heater may be controlled by means of a variac by means of which the voltage may be adjusted manually to give the desired air temperature or by using a thyristor circuit and manually altering the bias of the thyristor triggering unit thereby changing the power supply to the heater.The cooling device comprises a coil through which the gas is passed, the coil either being immersed in a constant temperature bath or, if the room temperature is low enough, merely left in the atmosphere. The hot or cold air passes from piping and valve system 3 into a plastics sheath 13 which surrounds part of either a leg or arm of the patient. The air is allowed to escape from the opposite end of the plastics sheath into the atmosphere. Air is used as it does not contaminate the limb or the atmosphere but any other gas may also be used provided it does not interfere with the subject or contaminate the atmosphere. The gas may be recirculated if desired. Typically the temperature of the cold air is 180 C and the temperature of the hot air 460C In an alternative embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 4, air is supplied by air blower 15 to chamber 17 in which is contained a heater 19. The air blower may be an industrial hot air blower similar to a ladies hair dryer.This air blower 15 is operated continuously and hot or cold air is provided by switching on or off the heating element of the blower. The hot air temperature is controlled by measuring the air temperature and varying the voltage delivered to heater 19. This method can only be used where the room air temperature is sufficiently low. The hot or cold air is passed to sheath 21 surrounding the subject s limb. The sheath can be made of any material which is suitable for restricting the air flow around the limb and compatible with the limb. Typically the sheath is formed from a plastics tube having a thickness of about 0.4 mm. The sheas may be provided with a funnel fitted inside one end to ensure a uniform air distribution across the end of the limb. The piping and valve system 3 Figure 3 can be made of, for instance, plastics or copper of sufficient diameter to give an air flow at the exit points of about 0.15 ls . Referring again to Figure 3, the valves 23and 25 of piping and valve sytem 3 have associated with them timing devices not show1 which may be either mechanical or electronic. A typical eletroi timing device includes a constant frequency oscillator of b tweer 20 and 200 Hz which is divided down and drives a bistable device. The period over which hot or cold air is applied may be varied by varying the frequency of the oscillator and or the any dividing circuits. The bistable device drives a relay which operates solenoid valves 23 and 25 and also sends a signal to the analyser device if required. The electrical signals, in the form of an electrocardiogram or other signal generated by the body, are either coupled to a magnetic tape recorder or to a data processing unit, usually real time computer, via an interface which may process the signal before feeding the information to the computer. Figure 5 is a block diagram of an example of an arrangement for treating an E.C.G. signal. The E.C.G. signal is fed into a three input differential amplifier 27 which is specially developed for E.C.G. amplification and has a small gain of 15.The amplifier 27 has two stages which are optically coupled and its ouput is fed into another amplifier not shown separately with an adjustable gain from 100 to 300. An offset facility is also provided so that the mean level of the output can be present.The signal amplitude at the output of this second amplifier is typically in the range 0.5 V to 1.5 V. This signal can be fed into an analogue magnetic tape recorder for storage and or fed directly onto the rest of the circuit. tbe reduce base line drift, which occurs with some subjects, a differentiating circuit is sometimes used between the two amplifiers. The time constant of the differentiators can be switched in various ranges from 0.05 s to 1 s. The E.C.G. signal from either the amplifier or the tape recorder is fed into a Schmitt trigger 29 which triggers at or near the peak of the R wave. This in turn sets off a series of monostables in sequence, the outputs of which generate signals to control the timing circuits. Another output from the Scmitt trigger is fed to the digital computer to indicate that the R wave has just appeared. The timing circuit is illustrated in the lower line of Figure 5. A 10 KHz clock 31 is divided down to 1 KHz by divider 33 and then into a counter 35 which will count the time intervals required. The first monostable 37 stops the counter, the second monostable 39 opens the gate 41 so that the number in the counter is transferred into a buffer store 43.The third monostable 45 introduces a delay and the fourth monostable 47 resets the counter so it will time the next interval. The operation of all four monostables takes place within half a period of the clock pulse. The contents of the buffer store can be read at any time in the interval between one operation of theSchmitt trigger 29 and the next. It is usually read some two or three ms after the computer has received the interrupt from theScmitt trigger 29. The register outputs are in binary coded decimal and are fed to the digital inputs of the computer. The RR interval time is transferred to the computer and a wave form reconstructed as shown in Figure 1C. This wave form is then sampled every 400 ms and the results fed into a fast Fourier analogue programme. A typical set of results from this programme is illustrated in Figure 2 An indication of the degree of entrainment can be obtained by using a filter at the forcing frequency and measuring the amount of the signal which comes through at that frequency. In operation the alternation of hot and cold air flow to the patient s limb is set for periods between LI s and 120 s and the subject is allowed to accommodate to the temperature at variation for a short period about 5 minutes and then the body p rameters for instance, the heart beat recorded or analysed direct for a further 5 minutes. This procedure is then repeated at different frequencies. For the best results the subject should have a core temperature of 370C, peripheral temperature of 340C and a pulse rate of less than 90 beats per minute, preferably below 70 beats per minute and in sinus rhythm. It is found that fcr a period time of from 8 s to 80 s the body of an adult can follow theperiodic temperature variations, that is to say, this is the range of frequencies over which entrainment takes place. Normal human subjects have the greatest entrainment with period times of approximately 30 seconds. No entrainment at all occurs with a period time of greater than 80 s or less than 8 s. controlAt rest the normal body mechanism oscillates at 0.03 Hz so it is not surprising that the best entrainment occurs close to this frequency. This entrainment is shown clearly in the autospectrum of the cardiac rate and peripheral blood flow signals and in the cross spectrum of the two. It is not apparent in the respiration signal. Figure 6 is a graph illustrating how the response of the thermal control mechanism varies with the forcing frequency.From this graph and capture ratio can be defined where the bandwidth is defined by the usual techniques. The average capture ratio for a small sample of normal adults was 24 s and for a subject with a slow heart rate was 21 s, and accordingly the heart rate is not important when defining bandwidth.
