# Apparatus for independent ventilation of two lungs with selective use of positive end expiratory pressures.

## Abstract
An apparatus comprises one respirator I coupled with the lungs by means of a double lumen tracheal tube II through monitoring controlling means III , containing two parallel inspiratory paths 1, 2 and two parallel expiratory paths 3, 4 . Each path is connected to a double lumen tracheal tube II through inspiratory 5, 6 and expiratory 7, 8 branches, respectively. In one inspiratory path 2 having a common point with the expiratory path 4 not containing the positive expiratory pressure valve there is placed the threshold inspiratory valve 12 connected in series with a pneumatic unidirectional valve 11 . Pneumatic unidirection al valves 10, 11 are situated in both inspiratory paths 1, 2 , respectively. The second expiratory path 3 comprises positive end expiratory pressure valve 18 .
