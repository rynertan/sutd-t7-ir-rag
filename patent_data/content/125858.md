## Description
lmproved Compositions for Treating Infected Burn Wounds This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions coptaining silver compounds. More particularly it relates to silver compounds suitable for use in the treatment of burn wound infection. Silver sulphadiazine is the most commonly used compound in pharmaceutical compositions for treating patients having burn wounds infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus aureus. However the activity of silver sulphadiazine in controlling these infections is less than optimum. Gayle et al, 1978 Journal of Trauma, 18, 317 323 reported 15 cases of silver sulphadiazine resistant Enterobacter cloacae in one burns unit and 13 of the 15 patients died. Of these deaths 7 were directly caused by, and 2 others significantly related to E cloacae septicaemia. An object of the present invention is to enhance the antimicrobial activity of silver compounds suitable for use in the treatment of burn wound infection. According to the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or carrier, a therapeutically effective amount of a silver compound suitable for treating burns and a synergistic amount of dibromopropamidine or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferably the pharmaceutical composition contains silver sulphadiazine and one of dibromopropamidine, dibromo propamidine isethionate B. P. 1980 or dibromopropamidine pamoate. The dibromopropamidine or salts thereof may be present in concentrations of 0. 00015 to 0. 30 per cent w w in pharmaceutical formulations of silver sulphadiazine at 0. 01 to 2. 0 per cent w w. Similar concentrations with preparations containing other silver salts are found to enhance the activity of these preparations which may infect the burn wound. The dibromopropamidine salts have been proposed for use as topical antibacterials BPC 1980 and Martindale, TheExtra Pharmacopoeia, 1977, 27th Edition, PharmaceuticalPress, London p. 517 but the synergistic effect exhibited in combination with silver salts is wholly unexpected. Thus greater antibacterial activity is obtained against all organisms tested than is observed with silver salts used alone at equivalent concentrations. The combination of dibromopropamidine isethionate 0. 154b with silver sulphadiazine 1. 0 also possesses activity against the silver resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosaR 351 against which silver sulphadiazine 1, 04b alone has no activity.The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Ag 3alone against this strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is 128 rg my 1. Examples are given in Table 1 of the in vitro enhancement of activity when cream formulations were tested in duplicate by the agar diffusion method against an inoculum 4 1 of approximately 5 x 10 organisms ml 1 of test organism. The test organisms used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 6750,Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6751, Enterobacter cloacae NCTC 9394 and NCTC 10005. Typically the compositions of this invention are prepared as topical antibiotic preparations in for example a water miscible cream such as Cetomacrogol cream BPC 1968, or modifications of such a cream, or into a gel such as can be prepared from a dispersion of carbomer Carbopal 940, Honeywell and SteinLtd. by neutralising with dilute ammonia solution.

This activity is shown by larger zones of inhibition of the order of 2 4 mm with the gel formulations. The gel also has the advantage that it can be sterilised by heating in an autoclave at 1150C for 30 minutes. The preparation is applied to the cleansed and debrided burn wound to give a layer approximately 2 to 4 mm thick. If left exposed the cream gel is applied twice daily but when used under an occlusive dressing then it may be applied at daily or longer intervals, according to the condition of the wound, until satisfactory healing has occured or the burn site is ready for grafting.
