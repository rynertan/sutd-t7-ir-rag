# A motor driven curtain operating unit.

## Abstract
A motor driven curtain operating unit for horizontally slidable curtains or the like comprises an elongate support 2 formining a channel 3 having two channel sections 3a, 3b laterally separated by a longitudinally extending central wall, each channel section 3a, 3b housing a respective run of a closed loop chain 4 one end of which loop passes over a sprocket 5 driveable by a remotely controllable motor 6 and the other end of which passes over a pair of return rollers 20 at the other end of the elongate support 2 from the motor 6 . Curtain displacement carriages 10 , attachable to a movable edge of a curtain, are slidable in the channels 3a, 3b and each incorporates a sleeve portion 11 through which the chain 4 can pass to form a connection between the chain 4 and the carriage 10 . A resiliently biased pin 13 projects into the sleeve 11 and forms an interconnec tion between the carriage 10 and the chain 4 which can be overcome to allow relative slip between the carriage 10 and the chain 4 if the force between them exceeds a certain threshold value such as if there is an obstruction to curtain movement or if the curtain has reached the end of its movement and the motor 6 is still energised.
