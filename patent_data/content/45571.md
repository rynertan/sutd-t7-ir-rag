## Description
This invention relates to processes for the production of certain phenyl substituted propanals. The preparation and odiferous properties of a number of phenyl substituted propanals of the general formula EMI1.1 wherein R represents an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms andR1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group has been reviewed byBerends and van der Linde. Perfumery and Essential Oil Record June 1967 p372 378 . Of the aldehydes which theyprepared those wherein R represents an isopropyl or a tertiary butyl group have become articles of commerce by virtue of their utility as ingredients of compounded perfumery compositions. The compound where R represent a para tertiary butyl group and R1 represents a methyl group is particularly valuable in this respect. These aldehydes are synthetic organic chemicals which have not been found In nature.Because of their known value the industry has devoted a good deal of effort to devising synthetic methods whereby these aldehydes can be manufactured more cheaply and efficiently. Besides those methods which are reviewed by Berends and van der Linde a number of other synthetic techniques have recently been proposed see for example USP 4070374 and British Patent Application 2009151. We have now discovered a novel process whereby certain of the aldehydes having the general formula described above can be prepared in high yield and at low cost. From one aspect our invention provides a process for the manufacture of an aldehyde having the formula I.EMI2.1 wherein R represents a secondary or tertiary alkyl group having 3 or 4 carbon atoms and R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group which comprises reducing an aldehyde which is 3 phenyl prop 2 enal or 3 phenyl 2 methyl prop 2 enal to the corresponding 3 phenyl propanol, alkylating said phenyl propanol with an appropriate alkylating agent so as to produce a product comprising a 3 mono alkyl phenyl propanol wherein the alkyl groupIs a secondary or tertiary alkyl group comprising 3 or 4 carbon atoms and oxidislng said 3 mono alkyl phenyl propanol so as to produce the corresponding propanal. In a preferred embodiment the invention provides a process for the manufacture of a compound having the formula 1, wherein the substituent R is in the para position on the aromatic ring. The aldehyde starting material may conveniently be produced by the condensation of benzaldehyde and propionaldehyde or acetaldehyde which is an example of an aldol condensation and can be carried out using any of the reaction techniques which are known per se to be useful for this reaction.By the term reaction techniques known per se in the specification is meant techniques for the reaction which are or have been used or described in the chemical literature. Thus the propionaldehyde or acetaldehyde may be added to a stirred solution of benzaldehyde in a suitable solvent e.g. an aqueous solution of an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol in the presence of a suitable basic catalyst e.g. sodium hydroxide. The reactants are preferably maintained at a temperature in the range 20 to 800C for a period of up to 3 hours. The reaction is normally carried out using at least a molar excess of benzaldehyde so as to minimise by product formation. The reaction products may be separated using conventional techniques e.g. fractional distillation. The separation of the 3 phenyl prop 2 enal is a strongly preferred.The preferred aldehyde for present use is propionaldehyde the preferred products being those wherein R1 represents a methyl group. The product aldehyde may be reduced to the corresponding alcohol using the reaction techniques for such a type of reduction known per se Conveniently, the reduction can be carried out by the catalytic hydrogenation of the aldehyde This hydrogenation may be effected in the presence of a suitable catalyst e.g. copper chromite at a temperature of from 120 to 1800C and a pressure of 100 to 150 p sig. hydrogen. Once the uptake of hydrogen has ceased the reaction mixture is filtered and the desired alcohol separated by distillation. In a second aspect the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of a 3 alkyl phenyl propanol i.e. one having the formula EMI3.1 wherein R and R1 are as defined above, which process comprises alkylating in the presence of an electrophilic catalyst a 3 phenyl propanol with an alkylating agent so as to produce a product comprising said 3 alkyl phenyl propanol. The introduction of an alkyl substituent into an aromatic compound may be achieved by a Friedel Crafts reaction e.g. reaction with an alkylating agent in the presence of an electrophilic catalyst. The alkylating agents and catalysts which are useful in the processes of our invention can conveniently be considered as falling into two distinct groups. The first group comprises alkylating agents which are secondary or tertiary alkyl halides having 3 or 4 carbon atoms and catalysts which are Lewis acids such as aluminium chloride, ferric chloride and zinc chloride. The second group comprises alkylating agents which are alkenes or secondary or tertiary alkanols having 3 or 4 carbon atoms or oligomers of such alkenes and catalysts which are protonic acids. The product of the alkylation may comprise a mixture of dialkylated and monoalkylated species and isomers thereof together with any unreacted starting materials. The relative proportions of these various possible products which are formed varies with the nature of the reactants, and catalyst and according to the conditions under which the alkylation is carried out. We have found that it is possible to influence the proportion of the various possible alkylated products by specific choice of the reaction conditions. In the case of the first group of alkylating agents the choice and volume of the solvent, the mode of addition of the reactants and catalyst, the molar ratio of the reactants and their concentration can all exert an appreciable effect upon the composition of the product although in general less than that exerted by the nature of reactants and the particular catalyst which is used. Nevertheless, the particular conditions under which the reaction is carried out may well make a significant difference to the composition of the desired product. The preferred alkyl halide alkylating agents for present use are chlorides especially tertiary butyl chloride and isopropyl chloride. The preferred Lewis acid catalysts are aluminium chloride and ferric chloride. Using this alkylating system the reaction Is preferably carried out by mixing the halide and the primary alcohol and adding the resulting mixture to a solution or suspension of the catalyst. The solvent may be any of those known for use in Friedel Crafts alkylations e.g. nitrobenzene or carbon disulphide. Preferably ethylene dichloride or di chloromethane is employed as the solvent. The temperature of the reactants is preferably maintained within the range 300 to 400C. The utilisation of lower temperatures appears to increase the proportion of para to meta alkylated product, but in general the lower the temperature the lower degree of conversion of the starting material, so in the preferred embodiment of this invention where the aim of the alkylation is the production of the para substituted product the temperature employed will be selected so as to achieve a compromise. The phenyl propanol and the alkyl chloride will normally be employed in approximately equimolar quantities. Larger proportions of phenyl propanol will favour the selective formation of a para substituted products but the use of such excesses is less preferred because of the consequent lower degree of conversion. The Lewis acid catalysts may be employed in any convenient quantity but in general we prefer to use from 0.3 to 1.0 moles most preferably 0.4 to 0.6 moles of catalyst per mole of phenyl propanol. Preferably a volume of solvent which is from 1 to 6 times the total volume of the reactants is employed. The use of a larger volume of solvent appears to favour the selective formation of a para substituted product but this Is in general uneconomic and we prefer to employ a volume of solvent which is from 2 to 5 times the volume of the reactants. The product mixture may be allowed to warm to ambient temperature if appropriate, at the end of the reaction and is then washed and dried. The product mixture can be separated from any unchanged starting material using conventional techniques e.g. fractional distillation. The particular technique for the alkylating procedures of this invention using the second group of alkylating agents and catalysts varies with the particular nature of the alkylating agent. The preferred alkenes for use according to our invention are propylene and isobutylene which are gases at the temperatures at which the processes will be carried out.The preferred technique for operating an alkylating process involving the use of gaseous alkene is to bubble the gas through a liquid medium comprising the other reactants. The alcohols useful to our invention are in essence those which are dehydrated and protonated in situ to generate an appropriate carbonium ion. Preferred alcohols for present use are isopropanol, and tertiary butanol. These alcohols are preferably added in small increments to the reaction medium as the reaction progresses. The preferred oligomeric alkenes for present use are di isobutylene a mixture of 2,4,4 trimethyl pent l ene and 2,4,4 trimethyl pent 2 ene and tri isobutylene a mixture of dodecanes consisting predominantly of 2,4,4,6,6 pentamethyl hept 1 ene . Alkylation processes using these oligomers as the alkylating agents are preferably carried out at a temperature below the boiling point of the oligomer so that the liquid oligomer can be gradually added to the other reactants during the alkylation reaction. Any acid which is sufficiently strong to protonate the alkylating agent and thereby generate an appropriate carbonium ion can be used to catalyse the reaction. However, acids which react chemically and irreversibly with the primary phenyl substituted alcohol should not be employed. The preferred catalyst for present use is phosphoric acid. The use of a concentrated acid i.e. at least 85 and preferably at least 90 acid being especially preferred. The alkylation reaction proceeds more rapidly and with greater conversion of the starting material as more acid is employed. A strong acid catalyst is preferably employed in a quantity of from 1 to 5 times more preferably 2 to 3 times the weight of the phenyl substituted alcohol. The reaction medium is preferably maintained at a temperature of from 500 to 1500C more preferably from 600 to 1000 say 600 to 800C. When using higher temperatures within these ranges e.g. 1000 to 150 C particular attention should be paid to any possible reaction between the protonic acid and the primary alcohol. At lower temperatures the rate of oligomerisation of the alkylating agent becomes more significant. Because of this tendency it is preferred to terminate the reaction before all the phenyl propanol has been converted e.g. at 50 or 60X conversion. Where oligomeric alkenes are employed as the alkylating agent a higher temperature e.g. 90 to 1200C is preferably employed. The desired mono alkyl phenyl substituted alcohol is preferably separated form the reaction product of the alkylation reaction prior to the final oxidation step. This separation may conveniently be effected by fractional distillation. If this fractionation is carried out sufficiently carefully, it is possible where appropriate to obtain a fraction which is rich in the para substituted product and a second fraction which is correspondingly rich in the meta substituted product. The alkylation product comprises a mixture of the meta and para isomers of the product. Mixtures which comprise at least 3 of the meta isomer are believed to be novel. Thus from another aspect our invention provides a mixture of the meta and para isomers of a 3 alkyl phenyl propanol as hereinbefore defined which comprises from 50 to 97 preferably from 80 to 97X of the para isomer. Mixtures of the corresponding aldehydes obtained by oxidation of alkylation product are also believed to be novel. The final oxidation step may be carried out by using reaction techniques of oxidation or dehydrogenation known perse for this type of oxidation or dehydrogenation. We prefer to dehydrogenate the alcohol in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as Raney nickel, Raney copper or most preferably copper chromite. This reaction may be effected by adding the alcohol to a stirred suspension of the catalyst in a suitable nonvolatile solvent which is maintained at a temperature in the range 100 to 2200C and at a subatmospheric pressure. The temperature and pressure are selected so as to arrange that the desired aldehyde product is fractionally distilled from the reaction medium as it is formed which arrangement minimises by product formation. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples EXAMPLE 1Preparation ofo Methylcinnamaldehyde. Propionaldehyde 87 gms 15 moles was added at 500C over a period of 5 hours to a stirred mixture of benzaldehyde 318 gms, 3 moles , methanol 500 mis , water 500 mis and sodium hydroxide 25 gms .
