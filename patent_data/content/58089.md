# A metal air cell and a method for the manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
The anode material of a metal air cell often expands on discharge of the cell. The present invention provides a solution to the problem of accommodating such expansion while at the same time providing a cell of satisfactorily low impedance. The cell 10 has a cathode assembly 24 an anode compartment 38 accommodating non fluid anode material 40 and a separator 36 that separates the anode compartment from the cathode. The cell 10 is centrifuged to force the anode material 40 against the separator 36 .
