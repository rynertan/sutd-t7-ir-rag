# Adhesion promoter improving the adhesion of rubber to metals.

## Abstract
An adhesion promoter, for increasing the adhesion of metal type components to rubber, comprises the reaction product of a nickel or cobalt salt of a carboxylic acid and an alkaline earth metal borate. The reaction product shows im proved performance over the reactants used alone or in combination.
