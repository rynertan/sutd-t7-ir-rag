# Apparatus for producing special yarns.

## Abstract
An apparatus for producing special yarn made of a fiber strand in which a number of fibers are randomly arranged along the lengthwise direction thereof, in which special yarn at least one of the yarn structural parameters, e.g., yarn count number or number of twist, changes along the lengthwise direction of the yarn. A pattern of change of the parameters of the yarn structure with respect to the length of the special yarn to be produced is stored in a central processing device, while a spun length of the special yarn is measured by a sensor. The yarn structural para meters are changed to correspond to the pattern set to the cen tral processing device and the special yarn is produced by the yarn forming device using another central processing device of the spinning frame. This apparatus can be used for a ring spinning frame, an open end spinning frame, a fasciated yarn spinning frame, and the like.
