# Process for the extraction of precious metals from concentrates thereof.

## Abstract
The process comprises the steps of subjecting the concentrate to a first leach with hot hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas to dissolve most of the gold, platinum and palladium, separating the leach residue and liquor, treating the residue with an excess of an alkaline oxidising agent to solubilise the ruthenium, slurrying the resulting solids in water, combining the precious metal values from the slurry with the liquor from the first leaching step and subjecting the resulting slurry to a second leach with hot hydrochloric acid and chlorine. The liquor from the second leach which is then separated from the remaining solids is a chloride solution which contains substantially all the platinum group metals and gold present in the concentrate.
