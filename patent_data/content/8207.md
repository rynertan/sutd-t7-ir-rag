# Insecticidal compositions, and preparation and use thereof.

## Abstract
Insecticidal compositions and the preparation and use thereof are disclosed. Substantially solvent free microcap sules comprising a core of an insecticide selected from the group consisting of methomyl, oxamyl, and mixtures of methomyl with oxamyl or other known insecticides within an encapsulating wall of a cross linked polyurea are dis closed. The microcapsules may be made by dissolving the insecticide s in methylene chloride containing a polyiso cyanate, emulsifying the solution and adding a diamine or polyamine to form a cross linked polyurea encapsulating shell around droplets of the emulsifying solution, followed by removal of methylene chloride. Compositions containing the microcapsules are also disclosed.
