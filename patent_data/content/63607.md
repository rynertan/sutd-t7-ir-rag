# MAGNETIC DISK DEVICE.

## Abstract
A magnetic disk device in which a plurality of magnetic recording disks 4 are mounted with a predetermined spacing via a magnetic recording disk mounting member 13 to a rotatably supported spindle 10 , provided with an air vent passing through the portions adjacent to the spindle 10 in the upper portion A and the lower portion B of the magnetic recording disk mounting member 13 to the spaces between the magnetic recording disks 4 , so that air is circulated by the centrifugal force produced by the spinning magnetic recording disks 4 .
