# Chip cutting tool.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a chip cutting tool comprising at least one cutting insert 11 , which is clamped in a holder body 10 . The insert 11 is clamped by means of the resilient force arising from the bending of a clamping arm 12 which is at tached to the holder body 10 . During mounting of the insert 11 the latter slides against the clamping arm 12 , thereby bending same in such a way that a larger bending of the clamp ing arm 12 occurs during an initial phase of the mounting of the insert 11 than during the final phase of this mounting.
