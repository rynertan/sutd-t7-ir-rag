# Data processor for processing word wise receivable data.

## Abstract
An integrated data processor is described which com prises a multiplier element provided with non symmetrical operand inputs and an arithmetic and logic unit which is connected to the output of the multiplier element by way of a connection over the full product width. The ALU also comprises an accumulator device. Multiple precision opera tions can thus be performed on the quantities received on each of the two inputs of the multiplier element. The data processor is notably suitable for performing identical opera ions on each of sequentially arriving signal quantities.
