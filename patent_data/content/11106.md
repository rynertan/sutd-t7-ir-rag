## Abstract
A portable electric router including a housing enclosing an electric motor, and having a router bit extending from one end of the housing and driven by the motor. A router base assembly includes handles and a flat base plate and is adjust ably fixed to the housing. The flat plate supports the router for movement along a work surface and is provided with a central opening through which the router bit extends to engage and penetrate the work surface. The other end of the housing has a support surface upon which the router can rest when the router is temporarily put down during use and when it is stored, or while the bit is changed, or while the base assembly is adjusted relative to the housing for depth adjustment of the bit. A switch is provided on the housing for turning the router motor on and off , and is controlled by a switch operator having a portion which extends through an opening in the router housing support surface. The switch operator has one portion which extends beyond the support surface when the electric motor is on , and is positioned flush with that sur face when the motor is off so that the motor is off and cannot be turned on when the router is supported on its support surface. The switch operator has another portion rigidly connected to the one portion and which is at the side of the router housing and close to one of the handles for turning the motor on and off .
