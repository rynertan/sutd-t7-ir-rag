# Process for the preparation of p nitrosodiphenylamine.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for the preparation of p nitroso diphenylamine hydrochloride comprising reacting diphe nylamine, C₅ C₁₀ alkyl nitrite and anydrous HCl in the pre sence of a C₅ C₁₀ aliphatic alcohol and essentially in the ab sence of an aromatic solvent. The p nitrosodiphenylamine hydrochloride may be converted to p nitrosodiphenylamine which in turn may be hydrogenated to p aminodiphenyl amine.
