The base portions have axially extending recesses 40, 44 , 50, 54 and an axially extending slot of lesser radial dimension than the radial dimension of the recess extends from the inner edges of the bases to the recess to form jaws in each base. The free ends of a flexible band are tightly folded back to form enlarged end portions on the ends of the band, the enlarged end portion and adjacent portion of the band being insertable axially into the recess and slot respectively.
