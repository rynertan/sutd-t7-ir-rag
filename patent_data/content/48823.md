# Recovery of precious metals from spent alumina containing catalysts.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the recovery ov precious metals which is accomplished by melting an aluminacon taining spent catalyst having therein a minor amount of a precious metal. The melted alumina containing carrier material is heated to about 2100 C in an electric furnace. The alumina material is poured from the furnace for utilization in abrasives manufacture. The precious metal collects in the bottom of the furnace and is either poured off and allowed to solidify or allowed to solidify in the furnace. In one embodiment of the invention, the steps of melting spent catalyst and heating to form a molten mixture is repeated a multiplicity of times with pouring off the molten carrier material. As a multiplicity of meltings and pourings are carried out, gradually there is an appreciable accumulation of the precious metals in the bottom of the furnace.
