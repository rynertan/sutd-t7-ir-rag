## Description
ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATION APPARATUS AND METHOD Methods and apparatus for generating electrical power have formed the basis of important energySystems for some time and have, accordingly, been the subject of relatively extensive study. Persons skilled in the arts of electrical power generation and use are familiar with a variety of ways in which electrical power is generated, transformed, converted and used. Electrical power has been generated as a result of electrochemical effects, photovoltaic effects, and eicctrodynamic effects. Electrodynamics, in the most generally knosm form, deals with the flow of electricity in conductors. .Using an analysis based on elec trodynamics, the operating principle of a conventional generator is traditionally illustrated by a rotating loop of conductive material positioned so that the axis about which the loop rotates is perpendicular to the lines of flux of a magnetic field.Upon rotation, the conductor cuts the magnetic flux lines and the amount of magnetic flux passing through the plane of the rotating loop of wire varies periodically from zero to a maximum value, as the plane of the loop successively passes through positions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic flux lines. Electrical current thus generated may be collected by means of slip rings in the case of an alternating current generator or by a commutator in the case of a pulsating direct current . It is known, in the construction and use of certain electrodynamic apparatus, to provide a mechanical prime mover such as a turbine for driving the electrodynamic devices, a relatively low power dynamoelectric apparatus for generating a tickler or excites voltage, and a larger electrodynamic apparatus as a main generator.Such electrodynamic apparatus has been widely successful and has been the base upon which current usage of electrical power has been built. As mechanical designers appreciate, however, the rotational speeds at which such electrodynamic apparatus are capable of operating are somewhat limited, particularly where acceleration and deceleration are required or encountered. Thus, limitations upon the operation of such mechanically driven electrodynamic apparatus have been established by the mechanical limitations of the structures used. With the above discussion in mind, it is an object of the present invention to accomplish the generation of electrical power while avoiding the design limitations heretofore imposed by mechanical characteristics such as static and dynamic balance and moments of inertia.In realizing this object of the present invention, an electrodynamic apparatus comprises an arrangement for the discharge of electron beams and including a plurality of deflection, emission and target electrodes defining a parallel array of elongate electron beam channels. By means of the imposition of a magnetic field on the array of channels with flux perpendicular to the longitudinal axes of the channels and the sequential discharge of electron beams through a succession of the channels while successive beams are directed through channels spaced one from another in a direction generally perpendicular .. to both the axes and the flux, electrical power is generated while avoiding certain of the mechanical limitations heretofore encountered. Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide an electrical current generating apparatus which combines an electrical energy source for supplying an exciter or tickler electrical current with an electron beam discharge arrangement as briefly described hereinabove and with appropriate convertors for delivering electrical power in a desired form. Preferably, the electron beam discharge apparatus has a plurality of juxtaposed sheets of electrically insulating material stacked in a predetermined array with the electrodes disposed among the stacked sheets and spaced thereby one from another for defining a channel array. In order that the invention will be more readily understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic representation of an electrical current generating apparatus embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a partly schematic representation of portions of the apparatus of Figure 1, more particularly defining certain apparatus elements Figure 3 is a somewhat schematic perspective view of one set of electrodes defining one elongate electron beam channel embodying the present invention Figure 4 is a schematic representation of a sequential discharge path for electron beams through a succe ssion of channels in accordance with one mode of operation of the apparatus embodying the present invention Figure 5 is a somewhat schematic end view representation of an array of electron beam channels, particularly illustrating a sequence of discharge of electron beams leading to the generation of pulsating direct current Figure 6 is a diagram illustrating the nature of electrical power generated by an apparatus as illustrated in Figure 5 Figure 7 is a view similar to Figure 5, indicating a sequence of discharge of electron beams through a succession of channels leading to the generation of an electrical current Figure 8 is a view similar to Figure 6, illustrating the wave form of electrical power generated by an apparatus as illustrated in Figure 7 Figure 9 is an exploded perspective view of a plurality of juxtaposed sheets of electrically insulating materials stacked in predetermined array for forming a portion of the electron beam discharge apparatus embodying the present invention and Figure 10 is an exploded perspective view of portions of the electrodynamic apparatus embodying the present invention. While the present invention will be described hereinafter with more particular reference to the accompanying drawings in which an embodiment of the present invention which is preferred at the time of writing of this description is illustrated, it is to be understood at the outset of the description which follows that persons skilled in the applicable arts will be able to depart from the specific apparatus now to be described while still incorporating the features of the present invention. Accordingly, the descripti on which follows is to be read broadly as an enabling disclosure directed to persons of appropriate skill in the applicable arts, and not as limiting upon the scope of this invention. Referring now more particularly to Figure 1, an electrical current generating apparatus in accordance with the present invention has an electrical energy source means as generally indicated at 10 for.supplying electrical current. Preferably, the source means supplies electrical current of relatively low power, of the order of one thousandth of the power level desired as an ultimate output from the apparatus in accordance with the present invention. In operating embodiments of the present invention, the source means 10 has comprised a photovoltaic cell such as a solar panel of known and generally available type. For purposes of driving an electrodynamic apparatus as will be described more fully hereinafter, the present invention contemplates the inclusion of an inverter, generally indicated at 11. The inverter may be of a type generally known to persons skilled in the applicable arts and commercially available, and will have the capability of receiving a direct current electrical power output from the source 10 and converting the output to an alternating current output. That alternating current output is delivered to an electrodynamic apparatus or generator generally indicated at 12, and to be described in greater detail.hereinafter. Electrical power generated by the electrodynamic apparatus 12 is, in turn, supplied to an alternating current to direct current converter generally indicated at 14.Again, the converter 14 may be of a generally known and comnlercially available type.Direct current electrical power delivered through the converter 14 may be received by appropriate storage means generally indicated at 15, in the form of an appropriate battery of electrochemical cells. Such a storage battery may, through appropriate inverter circuits generally indicated at 16, be connected with appropriate loads. As generally indicated in Figure 1, the various components of the electrical current generating apparatus of the present invention are operatively connected with and controlled by a central processing unit CPU control generally indicated at 18. The CPU control 18 preferably takes the form of an appropriate microprocessor.of types known to persons skilled in the applicable arts and capable of being programmed for control functions as described more fully hereinafter. Referring now more particularly to Figure 2, the electrodynamic apparatus 12 may be viewed as including a number of more specifically defined elements. More particularly, the apparatus includes electron beam discharge means for directing electron beams and including a plurality of deflection, emission and target electrodes to be more specifically described hereinafter. The electrodes cooperate for defining a parallel array of elongate electron beam channels, each closed or occluded at one end by an emission electrode and at the opposite end by a target electrode. Magnetic field generating means are provided for imposing on the array a magnetic field having a flux directed perpendicularly to the longitudinal axes of the channels.Control circuit means are electrically connected with the electron beam discharge means for applying thereto voltages effective to sequentially discharge electron beams through a succession of the channels, while directing successive beams through channels spaced one from another in a direction generally perpendi cular to both the axes and the flux. As will be more fully appreciated from the discussion which follows, the electrodynamic apparatus 12 includes a. central control unit 20 operatively connected with the CPU control 18. The central control unit 20 additionally is connected with excitors or coils 21, 22 for a north magnetic field and a south magnetic field. Supply voltage for the field excitors 21, 22 is derived from a field excitor supply 24. The electrodynamic apparatus 12 further includes horizontal deflection control circuits 25, vertical defleç tio n control circuits 26 and accelerator control circuits 28. Each of the deflection and anode controls 25, 26, 28 is connected both with a high voltage power supply 29 and with the central control untt 20. First and second bias control circuits 30, 31 are also connected both with the high voltage power supply 29 and the central control unit 20. A pulse generator 32 is connected with the high voltage power supply 29, the central control unit 20, and with an electronic commutator 34. The pulse generator controls, through gun multiplex circuits 35, 36 the speci fic channels through which electron beams are directed. By the cooperation of the elements schematically illus trated in Figure 2, generation of electrical current as described more fully hereinafter occurs. The description which follows will be more readily understood by a first reference to Figure 3 and the schematic perspective view there given of .one channel.or electron beam direction. More particularly, the channel is defined by a pair of.horizontal deflection electrodes 40, 41 and by a pair of vertical deflection electrodes 43,.44. One end of the elongate electron beam channel thus defined is closed or occluded by an emission electrode 45 from which an electron beam indicated in dash lines issues. The electron beam passes between a pair of accelerator anodes 46. The electron beam impinges, at the opposite end of the elongate channel, against a target electrode 49. As described more fully hereinafter, a plurality of such channels are arranged in a parallel array between north and south magnetic poles. One manner of operation of such a plurality of channels is schematically illus trated in Figure 4, where the channels themselves are not shown. Instead, Figure 4 includes first and second magnetic pole members 50, 51. As described above, the magnetic pole members 50, 51 are under the control of the field excitors 21, 22 and impose on an array of elongate electron beam channels therebetween a magnetic field having flux directed perpendicularly to the longitudinal axes of the channels. In one operating mode contemplated by the present invention, electron beams are directed through successive channels in a vertical array as indicated by solid, arrowed, lines.That is, in an uppermost channel, an electron beam is directed from left to right in Figure 4 from an emission electrode 45 to a target electrode 49. Immediately thereafter, and in an adjacent shown as a next lower channel, an electron beam is directed in the opposite direction from right to left in Figure 4 from an emission electrode to a target electrode. The directions of thewbeams emitted are indicated by arrows on the solid lines in Figure 4. Certain of the modes in which electrical power may be generated as contemplated by the present invention will become more clear from an expansion of the showing of Figure 4 as is to be found in Figures 5 through 8. In those figures, an array of elongate electron beam channels are shown in end view, as if the occluding emission and target electrodes were removed. For simplification, the magnetic field generating means has been omitted. Instead, lines are included to illustrate the manner in which electron beams are sequentially discharged through a succession of channels while being directed through channels spaced one from another in a direction generally perpendicular to both the axis of the channels and the flux.More particularly, in each of Figures 5 and 7, it may be assumed that the magnetic field generating means impose a magnetic field having flux directed generally from left to right through the cross hatched schematic end view of the electron beam dhannels. When operated as suggested by Figures 5 and 6, successive beams are directed through channels from top toward the bottom of an array as indicated at the left edge and then from top toward the bottom of a separate stack of channels as indicated at the right side of the array . The next succession of channels is displaced inwardly by one column or stack as indicated toward the left margin ofFigure 5 . Upon completing a sequence through such a succession of channels, a column toward the righthand side of the array is chosen. Such a sequence of successive beam discharges is generally indicated by the solid, arrowed, lines. When such a sequence is followed, the electrical power generated is of a fluctuating direct current type . As indicated in Figure 6, where voltage of electrical power generated is plotted against time, the voltage generated fluctuates with time but is always fluctuating to the same side of a base or zero line. Another mode of operation is illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, where generation of alternating current electrical power results. There, the succession is such that the sequential discharge moves through channels first in one direction across the magnetic field and then in the opposite direction across the magnetic field. Such motion in alternate directions across the magnetic field is to be distinguished from motion which is always in the same direction across the magnetic field, as has been described above. As is apparent from a consideration of the solid lines with directional arrows in Figure 7, the resultant operation approaches the classical explanation of dynamoelectric generators as using a loop of metallic conductive material. As indicated in Figure 8, the electrical power generated has voltage which varies up and down from an index or zero level. The modes of operation illustrated and described with reference to Figures 5 through 8 are not the only modes of operation for which the apparatus and method of this invention can be adapted. In stead, it is recognized that the sequential discharge of electron beams through channels may use alternate channels or may be moved diagonally through an array. Other approaches to displacement of electron beams will be conceived by persons skilled in more conventional electrodynamic apparatus once an understanding of the present invention has been obtained. It is to be understood that, in accordance with the present invention, the sequentially discharged electron beams are passed through channels spaced one from another in a direction generally perpendicular to both the axis o the elongate channels and the magnetic flux imposed.It is this operation which gives rise to the cutting of magnetic flux which generates electrical power in accordance with the present invention. Voltage levels generated in any given succession of a limited number of electron beam discharges may be low. However, due to the signi ficantly lower mass of the electron beam, as compared to a rotating loop of a metallic conductor, it is pos sible to rotate the electron beam at a significantly higher rate. As a consequence, the rate of flux cutting becomes such that significant electrical power is gen erated. Preferably, the electron beam discharge means in accordance with the present invention comprises a plurality of juxtaposed sheets of electrically insulat ing material stacked in predetermined array. The elec trodes described hereinabove are disposed among the stacked sheets and spaced thereby one from another to define the beam channels. One form of such a construc tion is illustrated in Figure 9, wherein a limited number of such stacked sheets are shown. As will be appreciated from the discussion which follows, a signifi cantly greater number of sheets than those shown in Figure 9 are typically used in order to provide an array packed with relatively high density. Further, the physical space required for each individual channel may be reduced.Stated differently, the sheets illus trated in Figure 9 are in a scale chosen for clarity of illustration only, and not intended as indicative of the precise physical dimensions of an apparatus which operates in accordance with this invention. Referring now more particularly to Figure 9, the plurality of sheets there illustrated are ar ranged in such a manner as to illustrate the five dif ferent patterns of electrodes and connecting terminals which are used in assemblying an apparatus in accordance with the present invention in a preferred form. Three of the patterns appear on relatively large sheets and primarily define the electron beam channels. Two of the patterns appear on smaller sheets which are used primarily to establish connections. Referring now to the stack illustrated, the larger two uppermost sheets illustrate, on their uppermost and visible surfaces, two of the patterns employed.The concealed lower surface of the uppermost sheet bears a pattern identical to the visible uppermost surface of the second sheet from the top. The second sheet from the top bears, on its concealed lowermost surface, a pattern which is the same as that on the visible face of the uppermost sheet. Stated differently, the two larger sheets appearing uppermost in Figure 9 are identical, with one sheet having one pattern facing upwardly and visible while the other sheet has the reversed pattern facing upwardly and visible . The third sheet from the top in the stack of Figure 9 is of greater dimension and bears identical patterns on the upper and visible surface and on the lower concealed surface. The exploded portion of the stack illustrated in Figure 9 includes two sets of such three sheets with the distinction being in the particular orientation of the third sheet from .the top and the sixth sheet from the top. at the bottom of the exploded stack . Reference characters used in Figure 3 to identify channel defining electrodes have been used in Figure 9 to identify comparable elements, with the addition of single, double and triple prime notation to indicate elements cooperating in defining differing sets of channels. In addition, the stack of Figure 9 includes eight termination or connection strips 52, each of which is printed with a first pattern on one surface thereof and a second pattern on the other surface thereof.As will be apparent, the termination strips or sheets are arranged to expose to view both of these patterns. Referring now more particularly to the uppermost large sheet, the visible surface of that sheet bears conductive elements defining vertical deflection electrodes. As is visible to the leftward end of the sheet second from the top in Figure 9, conductive portions of the vertical deflection electrodes extend around the end portion of the sheet and are joined in a connective strip. The surface of the sheet bearing the connective strip for the vertical deflection electrodes additionally bears horizontal deflection electrodes and a connective strip therefor. As will be appreciated, the greater dimensions of the sheets carrying the emission electrodes 45 , 45 1 and target electrodes 49 , 49 accomplish engagement of the end portions of those sheets with the immediately superposed termination or connection strips The respective patterns provide for connective engagement with the emission electrodes and with the target electrodes so as to provide for the connections necessary for the central control unit 20 to select the electrodes appropriate to a specific channel being used. When a stack of sheets are assembled into the apparatus Figure 10 the array formed may include numbers of individual beam channels of the order of 5,000 or more. The channels are arranged in generally vertical columns, with adjacent columns extending in any desired grid formation. For example, the channels may be in columns of 50, with 100 columns formed each adjacent the others to define an array appearing, in end view, similar to those of Figures 5 and 7. In one form contemplated by the present invention, the electrodes described hereinabove comprise conductive strips affixed to planar faces of the sheets. Persons familiar with the manufacture and assembly of printed circuit board electronic devices ill be familiar with a number of ways in which such conductive strips may be affixed to the planar faces of sheets of electrically insulating material. It is contemplated by the present invention that any such known processes may be employed, depositing conductive material such as copper, silver or gold through printing, vacuum deposition, plating, etching, or other similar techniques. Such techniques may use substrates of mica, various resins or reinforced resin laminates, and other known materials. It is further contemplated by the present invention that the sheets of electrically insulating material and the conductive elements defining electrodes may be formed in other known manners. More particularly, the technology of semiconductor manufacture has developed to such a point that it may well be possible to create sheets of electrically insulating semiconductive material having zones therewithin functioning as conductive portions defining electrodes in accordance with the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention specifically contemplates such modification of the particular form here described. In assembling the apparatus in accordance with the present invention, a substantial number of sheets as described hereinabove with reference to Figure 9 are prepared and are then stac fid oe to form an array of channels. As assembled, the apparatus comprising the plurality of sheets generally has the appearance of a block encircled by conductive bands electrically connected with the various electrode structures within the block and permitting selection of those coordinated electrodes defining a channel and appropriate for the discharge of an electron beam in accordance with the present invention. To either side of the block of sheets are the magnetic pole structures 50, 51 which impose on the array of channels the magnetic field necessary for the generation of electrical power.The magnetic pole structures 50, 51 and the generating apparatus 12 are enclosed within an housing for vacuuming capsulation of the electron beam discharge means, inasmuch as such beams are more readily emitted and controlled under high vacuum conditions. Preferably, the housing means including end closure member 60, 61 illustrated in Figure 1X is formed of a nonmagnetic or diamagnetic material effective as a radiation shield, such as relatively thick aluminum sheets. As indicated in Figure 10, the control circuitry generally indicated at 20 for the generator may be mounted upon one of the portions of the housing means. In an operating embodiment constructed in accordance with the present invention, conductive strips defining electrodes were formed on substrates of reinforced resin by printing copper and thereafter plating the printed copper. The substrate material was of sufficient characteristics and dielectric quality to provide insulation for a voltage differential of 15,000 volts and, in the operating embodiment, was high temperature Kapton. By way of eample, the thickness of the conductive elements was 0.0127 inches , while the spacing of electrodes defining the channels was modularly based on a distance of 0.254mm 0.010 inches .
