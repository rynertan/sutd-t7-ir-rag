# METHOD OF DESIGNING A LOGIC CIRCUITRY

## Abstract
Logic is synthesized from a flowchart level description by first generating an AND OR logic design 104 , simplify ing the AND OR logic, converting the AND OR logic to NAND or NOR logic 106 , applying particular sequences of simpli fying transformations to the NAND or NOR logic, converting the simplified NAND or NOR logic to a target technology 108 , and simplifying the target technology where possible. The end result is an interconnection of primitives of the target technology in a language from which automated logic diagrams can be produced.
