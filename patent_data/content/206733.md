## Description
CLONED HUMAN SERUM ALBUMIN GENE This invention relates to a method for synthesising a human serum albumin gene. This invention further relates to a plasmid containing a cloned human serum albumin gene and a microorganism transformed with such a plasmid. Human serum albumin sometimes referred to hereinafter as HSA is the major protein component of plasma. The protein is produced in the liver and is primarily responsible for maintaining normal osmolarity in the bloodstream. It also is capable of binding and transporting various small molecules via the blood. HSA is administered in various clinical situations.Shock and burn victims, for instance, usually require doses of HSA to restore blood volume and thus ameliorate some of the symptoms associated with trauma. Persons suffering from hypoproteinemia or erythroblastosis fetalis also are likely to require treatment with serum albumin. To date, HSA is produced primarily as a by product from the fractionation of donated blood. A drawback to this is that the cost and supply of blood can vary widely. The blood also may contain undesirable agents such as hepatitis virus. It therefore would be advantageous to develop an alternative source of HSA. It accordingly is an object of this invention to produce human serum albumin in microorganisms. It is a further object of this invention to so produce HSA economically. It also is an object of this invention to develop a cloning procedure that can be applied to other serum proteins. Brief Description of the Figures Figure 1 shows a partial restriction map of a fulllength HSA cDNA cldne isolated by the procedures described herein. Figure 2 shows the DNA sequence of the 5 3 strand of the non coding and coding regions of the full lengthHSA cDNA, as well as the amino acid sequence specified by the DNA sequence. Figure 3 shows an A260 profile of sucrose gradient fractions of mRNA. Fraction group B was used as the template in the synthesis of HSA cDNA. Figure 4 shows pGX401, a recombinant plasmid containing a full length HSA cDNA insert. Figure 5 shows the DNA sequence in the region of codon 97 for HSA sequences derived from three different human livers. According to one aspect of the present invention, we provide a synthetic hunan serum albunin gene. The term 11synthetic as used herein should be understood to include DNA sequences produced by use of recombriant DNA techniques and or chemical synthesis. In accordance with the present invention, a novel hunan serum albumin HSA gene has been cloned and bacterial expression of the gene is described. The nucleotide sequence of the full length HSA gene and the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide specified by that gene also are reported herein. The procedure more fully described hereinafter which has been used to prepare an HSA producing microorganism can be divided into the following stages 1 obtaining HSA MRNA from a suitable source, e.g. by recovery and isolation of theHSA rreA fran HSA producing cells, 2 in vitro synthesis of camplementary DNA cDPa , using the lL as a template and conversion of the cDNA to the double stranded form and 3 insertion of the double stranded cDNA into a suitable cloning vector and transformation of microbial cells with that cloning vector. The procedures described herein resulted in the preparation of a full length clonedHSA cE. Eukaryotic genes are contained in the chroinosomalDNA of cell nuclei. This chromosomal DNA exists in a compact nucleoprotein complex called chromatin.Eukaryotic chromosomal DNA contains intervening sequences introns within the coding sequences exons , which would not permit correct expression in bacteria. For this reason a preferred method for producing contiguous coding blocks of a particular protein involves the use of messenger RNA mRNA . Messenger RNA has a ribonucleotide sequence corresponding to the gene of interest without the introns and conveniently can be recovered from eukaryotic cells that produce the protein specified by the gene. Human serum albumin mRNA can be recovered in useful quantities from human liver cells. The HSA mRNA produced by the liver cells is complementary to one of the two strands of the HSA gene and may be employed as a template for the synthesis of complementary DNA cDNA as hereinafter described. To effectively utilize the mRNA for the synthesis of cDNA, it advantageously is recovered from the cells in relatively pure form. The guanidine thiocyanate guanidine hydrochloride extraction procedure described by McCandliss et al., Methods in Enzymology 79 51 1981 , advantageously may be used to recover and purify the HSA mRNA. RNA is inherently less stable thanDNA, and is particularly subject to degradation by ribonucleases that are present in the cells. Therefore, mRNA recovery procedures generally employ means for rapidly inactivating any ribonucleases which are present. In general, recovery of total RNA is initiated by disrupting the cells in the presence of a ribonuclease inactivating substance. Disruption of the cells may be accomplished by subjecting the cells to a lysing reagent, freezing thawing, or mechanical disruption preferably a combination thereof. A mixture of guanidine thiocyanate and a reducing agent, such as mercaptoethanol, has been found to function effectively as a ribonuclease inactivator McCandliss, et al., supra . After disruption of the cells, the solid cell debris is removed, e.g. by centrifugation, and the RNA is precipitated from the resulting clarified solution.Precipitation is effected by known techniques, such as adding a water miscible alcohol, e.g. ethanol, to the solution in a precipitating amount. The RNA then is resuspended in a guanidine hydrochloride solution and precipitated with ethanol for two successive cycles. At this point the RNA is undegraded and free of proteins andDNA. The next step is the separation of mRNA from the total precipitated RNA. Human serum albumin mRNA is polyadenylated, therefore, it readily can be separated from non adenylated RNA by affinity chromatography with oligodeoxythymidylate oligo dT cellulose Aviv, H., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USk 69 1408 1972 McCandliss, et al., supra . Total RNA can be applied to a column in an approximately 0.5 M NaCl containing solution. Under these conditions only poly A RNA binds to the oligo dT cellulose and can be removed specifically by washing the column in a salt free solution. To enrich the preparation for HSA mRNA, the polyA RNA can be fractionated according to size by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Activity of the RNA in the various gradient fractions can be verified by in vitro translation in a reticulocyte lysate Pelham, H., et al.Eur. J. Biochem. 67 247 1976 and by electrophoretic analysis of the protein products Laemmli, U., Nature 227 680 1970 . Once a poly A RNA fraction able to synthesize proteins the size of HSA has been isolated, it can be used to provide a template for cDNA synthesis. This procedure involves enzymatically constructing doublestranded DNA, which has a nucleotide base pair sequence identical to the coding sequence of the original chromosomal gene. The cDNA does not contain any noninformational segments introns within the coding region which might be present in the eukaryotic gene, and thus can ultimately be transcribed and translated in prokaryotic systems. Synthesis of HSA cDNA employs the enzymes reverse transcriptase, Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and S1 nuclease Kacian, D., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 73 2191 1976 McCandliss, R., et al., Methods inEnzymology 79, p. 601 1981 . Reverse transcriptase catalyzes the synthesis of a single strand of DNA from deoxynucleoside triphosphates on the mRNA template. The poly r A tail of the mRNA permits oligo dT of about 12 to 18 nucleotides to be used as a primer for cDNA synthesis. The use of a radioactively labelled deoxynucleoside triphosphate facilitates monitoring of the synthesis reaction. Generally, a a32P containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate advantageously may be used for this purpose.The cDNA synthesis generally is conducted by combining the mRNA, the deoxynucleoside triphosphates, the oligo dT and the reverse transcriptase in a buffered solution. This solution is incubated at an elevated temperature, e.g., about 40 50 C, for a time sufficient to allow formation of the cDNA copy, e.g.about 5 20 minutes. The conditions of the reaction are essentially as described by Kacian, D.L., et al., supra.After incubation, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid hereinafter EDTA is added to the solution, and the solution is extracted with phenol chloroform 1 1 by vol. . The aqueous phase is advantageously purifed by gel filtration chromatography, and the cDNA mRNA complex in the eluate is precipitated with alcohol. The mRNA can be selectively hydrolyzed in the presence of the cDNA with dilute sodium hydroxide about 0.1 M at an elevated temperature, e.g., about 60 80 C for about 15 30 minutes. Neutralization of the alkaline solution and alcohol precipitation yields a singlestranded cDNA copy. The single stranded cDNA copy has been shown to have a 5 poly dT tail, and to have a 3 terminal hairpin structure, which provides a short segment of duplex DNA Efstratiadis, A., et al., Cell, 7, 279 1976 . This 3 hairpin structure can act as a primer for the synthesis of a complementary DNA strand. Synthesis of this complementary strand is conducted using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I Klenow, H., et al., Eur. J.Biochem., 22, 371 1971 in a reaction mixture containing the deoxynucleoside triphosphates. The duplex cDNA recovered by this procedure has a 3 loop, resulting from the 3 hairpin structure of the single stranded cDNA copy. This 3 loop can be cleaved by digestion with the enzyme, S1 nuclease, using essentially the procedure ofMcCandliss et al., Methods in Enzymology 79 601 1981 .The S1 nuclease digest may be extracted with phenolchloroform, and the resulting cDNA precipitated from the aqueous phase with alcohol. The intact double stranded DNA about 2000 base pairs corresponding to a human serum albumin gene can be isolated by, for example, sucrose gradient centrifugation, using the procedure of McCandliss supra p. 51. In order to determine the sizes of the DNA in the sucrose gradient, aliquots of the gradient fractions are electrophoresed in a polyacrylamide gel with molecular weight markers. The resulting gel is first stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the markers and then autoradiographed to detect the radioactive cDNA. The fractions of the gradient containing DNA molecules larger than 1000 base pairs are pooled and the DNA is precipitated with ethanol. For purposes of amplification and selection, the double stranded cDNA gene prepared as described above is generally inserted into a suitable cloning vector, which is used for transforming appropriate host cells.Suitable cloning vectors include various plasmids and phages, with plasmids being preferred in this case. The criteria for selecting a cloning vector include its size, its capability for replicating in the host cells, the presence of selectable genes, and the presence of a site for insertion of the gene. With respect to its size, the vector is advantageously relatively small, to permit large gene insertions, and so as not to divert large amounts of cellular nutrients and energy to the production of unwanted macromolecules. The vector also includes an intact replicon which remains functional after insertion of the gene. This replicon preferably directs the desired mode of replication of the plasmid, i.e., multiple copies or a single copy per cell, or a controllable number of copies per cell.Genes specifying one or more phenotypic properties, preferably antibiotic resistance, facilitate selection of transformants. The insertion site is advantageously a unique restriction site for a restriction endonuclease. A cloning vector meeting all of these criteria is the plasmid pBR322. The cDNA can be conveniently inserted into this plasmid by a homopolymeric tailing technique. Homopolymer tails are added to the 3 hydroxyl groups of the human serum albumin double stranded cDNA gene, by reaction with an appropriate deoxynucleoside triphosphate, in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The plasmid is opened by digestion with the appropriate endonuclease,and complementary homopolymer tails are added to the 3 hydroxyl groups of the opened plasmid, using the homopolymeric tailing technique.Appropriate reaction conditions have been described for the addition of dC residues to ds cDNA McCandliss, R., et al., page 601 supra Roychoudhury, R., et al., Nucleic Acids Research 3 101 1976 and of dG residues to Pstl treated pBR322 Maeda, S., Methods in Enzymology 79 607 1981 . In a preferred embodiment, however, the molar excess of dXTPs to 3 ends is in the range of 3000 to 5000. Progress of the reactions is monitored until the chain length is approximately 15. The tailed cDNA and plasmids are recovered, e.g., by phenol extraction followed by alcohol precipitation. The homopolymeric ends of the two DNAs are complementary and will anneal together under appropriate conditions to yield a recombinant plasmid containing the HSA gene Maeda, S., Methods in Enzymology 79 611 1981 . A suitable strain of E.coli may be transformed with this recombinant plasmid, using essentially the method ofLederberg, J. Bacteriology 119 1072 1974 and be maintained indefinitely. Generally, several hundred to several thousand clones are produced by these procedures and can be screened for the presence of the HSA gene with, for example, rat serum albumin cDNA. A nick translated Maniatis, T., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72 3961 1975 rat cDNA having 85 homology with human cDNA can be used to hybridize to plasmid cDNA attached to nitrocellulose filters Grunstein, M., et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72 396 1975 , Southern, E.M. J Mol. Biol., 98 503 1975 . In this procedure, DNA from each colony or from groups of colonies is fixed to discrete zones of a nitrocellulose filter and denatured. Alternatively, the DNA can be electrophoresed in a gel prior to fixing on a filter. A solution of the radioactively labeled rat cDNA is applied thereto under hybridizing conditions. Unhybridized rat cDNA is washed from the filter, and colonies containing DNA to which the rat cDNA hybridized are identified by autoradiography.One positive clone was identified but found to be an incomplete HSA cDNA by DNA sequencing. A portion of thisHSA cDNA was then nick translated in order to rescreen the entire bank of clones. Ninety positive hybridization signals were thus obtained. Positive clones may be cultivated on suitable growth media to obtain ample quantities of cells from which to extract the plasmid DNA. The plasmid DNA is extracted, using conventional techniques, such as disruption of the cells, followed by phenol extraction, and alcohol precipitation. The plasmid and chromosomal DNAs may be separated, e.g. by electrophoresis or cesium chloride equilibrium centrifugation. Plasmid DNA containing inserts of about 1500 to 2000 base pairs are selected for further characterization. The cloned gene can be excised from the plasmid DNA and then characterized by sequencing analysis Sanger,F., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 74 5463 1977 Maxam, A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74 560 1977 . By these procedures a prepro HSA clone has been isolated. An E. coli HB101 culture transformed with the plasmid containing this prepro HSA gene has been deposited with the U.S. Department of AgricultureNorthern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria,Illinois, as NRRL No. B 15784. A diagnostic partial restriction map of this HSA gene insert is shown inFigure 1 of the drawings and Figure 2 shows the 5 3 strand of the non coding and coding regions, along with the amino acid sequence specified by the gene. The cloned prepro HSA coag sequence consists of 2050 base pairs excluding the oligo dC tails added to the cDNA. The gene has noncoding regions at the 5 end base pairs 1 31 and at the 3 end base pairs 1858 2050 . The 5 end of the coding region 32 103 base pairs includes a 24 amino acid leader an 18 amino acid pre sequence followed by a 6 amino acid pro sequence and the mature human serum albumin protein is specified by the region from base pair number 104 to base pair number 1858. As used in Figure 2 and elsewhere herein, the abbreviations have the following standard meaning A deoxyadenyl T thymidyl G deoxyguanyl C deoxycytosyl GLY glycine ALA alanine VAL valine LEU leucine ILE isoleucine SER serine THR threonine PHE phenylalanine TYR tyrosine TRP tryptophan CYS cysteine MET methionine ASP aspartic acid GLU glutamic acid LYS lysine ARG arginine HIS histidine PRO proline GLN glutamine ASN asparagineIt will be appreciated that because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, the nucleotide sequence of the gene can vary substantially.For example, portions or all of the gene could be chemically synthesized to yield DNA having a different nucleotide sequence than that shown in Figure 2, yet the amino acid sequence would be preserved, provided that the proper codon amino acid assignments were observed. Having established the nucleotide sequence of the human serum albumin gene and the amino acid sequence of the protein, the gene of the present invention is not limited to a particular nucleotide sequence, but includes all variations thereof as permitted by the genetic code. It is believed that the amino acid sequence set forth in Figure 2 and claimed herein represents a genomicHSA allele that is widespread in the human population, in contrast to the sequences previously published in the scientific literature. Polymorphism is known for HSA.Protein electrophoresis has revealed over twenty genetic variants of HSA Weitkamp et al., Ann. Hum. Genet.London 36 381 1973 . Two differing amino acid sequences have been reported previously. See Lawn, R.M., et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 9 6103 1981 and Dugiaczyk,A., et al., PNAS 79 71 1982 . The DNA sequence ofFigure 2 differs from each of these published sequences.Although some of the differences occur in third base position of codons or in the noncoding regions, and as such do not cause amino acid changes, conflicting nucleotide sequence data suggest different amino acids at positions 97 and 396. In Figure 2, the amino acid represented by codon 97 GAG is glutamic acid. The same was reported by Lawn, et al., supra. Dugiaczyk, however, reported that codon to be GGG glycine . Codon 396 in Figure 2, also is designated GAG gluatmic acid .Dugiaczyk reported the same however, Lawn reported codon 396 to be AAG lysine . Thus, each of the three DNA sequences would encode a different polypeptide. ExampleIV below sets forth the procedures followed to determine that these differences represented true protein polymorphism and not merely experimental artificats. The present invention has been described in connection with the use of E. coli as the bacterial host for recombinant DNA containing the HSA gene, but skilled molecular biologists will appreciate that other gramnegative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas gram positive bacteria, such as Bacillus higher unicellular organisms, such as yeasts and fungi, and mammalian cells can be employed for cloning and or expression of the HSA gene. The invention is further illustrated by reference to the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting. EXAMPLE I Isolation of HSA mRNA from Human Liver Tissue Messenger RNA mRNA was isolated from human liver tissue taken from a 10 year old accident victim.Extreme care was taken throughout the procedures to avoid ribonuclease contamination of the mRNA preparation.These measures included the use of new, sterile laboratory glassware, treatment of solutions with diethylpyrocarbonate when appropriate, followed by autoclaving, keeping the preparation cold when possible and using gloves to avoid contact of the preparation with skin. Frozen human liver tissue 10.5 grams was homogenized in 210 mls lysis solution 4M guanidine thiocyanate 0.lM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 0.1M 2 mercaptoethanol using a Virtis homogenizer. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 8750 rpm, 4 C, for 10 minutes in aSorvall GSA rotor, and the supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge bottle. To the supernatant were added 0.04 volume 1M acetic acid and 0.5 volume 95 ethanol.After 2 hours at 200C, the mixture was centrifuged at 7500 rpm, 10 minutes, 40C and the pellet resuspended in 50 mls wash solution 6M guanidine hydrochloride l0mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.0 10mM dithiothreitol. Centrifugation at 5500 rpm, 10 minutes, pelleted particulate debris, and the supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge bottle. To the supernatant were added 0.04 volume 1M acetic acid and 0.5 volume 95 ethanol. After 2 hours at 20iC, the mixture was centrifuged at 7200 rpm 20 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mls wash solution, and 0.04 volume 1M acetic acid and 0.5 volume 95 ethanol were added. The mixture was kept at 20iC for 12 hours, then centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 40C in a Sorvall SS 34 rotor.The pellet was resuspended in 15 mls sterile distilled H2O dHzO and extracted with an equal volume of 4 1 chloroform butanol. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and 0.1 volume 2.4 M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes 95 ethanol were added. After 2.5 hours at 20 c, theRNA was pelleted by centrifugation and the pellet was resuspended in 2 mls sterile dH2O . A total of 19.2 msRNA was recovered. mRNA was then separated from the total RNA using generally, the oligo dT cellulose affinity chromatography procedure described in Aviv et al.. supra and McCandliss, et al., supra. A column of 5 qrams oligo dT cellulose was washed with one column volume 0.1M NaOH to denature any ribonuclease present, then equilibrated with high salt buffer l0mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4 0.5M NaCl 0.5 sodium dodecyl sulfate . The totalRNA preparation, dissolved in two mls dH2O above, was heated at 70 C for 1 minute, then cooled on ice to room temperature.Next, 0.1 volume 5M NaCl, 0.04 ml 0.5MTris HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 ml 10 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS were added to the RNA. 8 mls high salt buffer were then added to the RNA and the solution was applied to the column with a flow rate of about 10 drops minute. After the sample had passed through, unbound RNA was washed from the column with high salt buffer. Fractions 1 2 ml each were collected and the optical density at 260 nm A260 of each fraction was measured in a spectrophotometer. The column was washed until the A260 readings of fractions dropped below 0.05. Undesired RNA was further washed from the column with low salt buffer 1OmM Tris HCl, pH 7.4 0.2M NaCl 0.1 SDS and fractions were collected as above until the 60 had dropped to 0.05. Next, the mRNA was eluted from the column with elution buffer lOmM Tris HC1, pa 7.4 1mM EDTA 0.1 SDS and 1 ml fractions were collected until the A260 was less than 0.05. The first 15 fractions those having the highest OD260 readings were pooled and the mRNA was precipitated by adding 0.1 volume 2.4M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes 95 ethanol, and placing at 20eC for 12 hours. The eluted mRNA was then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 800 ul elution buffer. After heating the resuspended pellet at 700C for 90 seconds then cooling on ice 0.1 volume 5M NaCl and 0.05 volume 10 SDS were added. The eluted mRNA prepared above was then further purified by passage over a second oligo dT celluose column. A column containing 0.1 gram oligo dT cellulose was washed with NaOH, then with hiqh salt buffer as previously described. The RNA was applied to the column and fractions were collected with high salt, low salt, and elution buffers as with the first column. The peak fractions from the elution buffer step were pooled and the twice purified mRNA was precipitated and pelleted as before. The mRNA was then size fractionated on a 12 ml sucrose gradient as described in McCandliss et al.,Methods in Enzymology, 79, pp. 56 58. A 5 20 sucrose gradient was prepared in gradient buffer 0.02M sodium acetate, pH 5.6 and chilled at 40C for 3 hours. 100us of the mRNA was resuspended in 100oil gradient buffer, heated at 800C for 2 minutes, quick cooled in an ice bath, then layered on top of the gradient. A second 520 gradient had E. coli 16 and 23S rRNA 100pg total loaded on it to serve as molecular weight markers. The two gradients were centrifuged in a BeckmanSW40 rotor at 38,000 rpm for 12.5 hr at 4 0C. Fractions of about 0.5 ml were then collected and the A260 measured fraction 1 is that collected from the bottom of the gradient tube. The A260 peak was divided into 6 groups of fractions, groups A through F as shown in Figure 3. The fractions in each group were pooled and the mRNA precipitated with 0.1 volume 2.4 M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes 95 ethanol. Fraction groups containing mRNA which encodes protein of the size expected for HSA were identified by in vitro translation using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit available from Bethesda Research Laboratories and used according to manufacturer s instructions supplemented with 35S methionine. A reaction mixture for each fraction group contained the components necessary for translation of the mRNA into radioactively labeled proteins which were visualized by electrophoresis on a 12.5 polyacrylamide SDS gel, followed by fluorography. The fluorogram showed a prominent protein band of the size expected for HSA 68,000 daltons among the translation products of fraction groups B and C. Group B had a much lower percentage of protein products in undesirable low molecular weight range so the mRNA in group B was chosen for use as a template in the synthesis of cDNA. EXAMPLE II Synthesis of HSA cDNA Generally, the cDNA synthesis procedure ofMcCandliss et al., Methods in Enzymology, 79, pp. 601607 1981 was used. Incorporation of a radioactively labeled deoxynucleotide allowed monitoring of the synthesis and calculation of yields at each step. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized on the mRNA template, using oligo dT as a primer, as follows. Prepared mix and kept on ice 0.5 M Tris HCl, pH 8.3 20it1 1.4 M RC1 10oil 0.25M Mac12 8p1 0.05M dATP, pH 7.0 21 0.05M TTP, pH 7.0 2 p 1 0.05M dCTP, pH 7.0 2iil 0.05M dGTP, pH 7.0 2V1 0.01M dithiothreitol 4p1 sterile distilled H2O 45V1 aqueous label, a32P dCTP 10pCi p1 Sul 1 00us Added remaining components oligo dT 12 t8 250pg ml 20pl actinomycin D 500 pg ml, aqueous 16p1 10pg mRNA, B fraction 201 sterile dH2O 37 l AMV reverse transcriptase 16u ul 7ul Total volume 200p1 Avian myeloblastosis virus AMV reverse transcriptase is kept at 800C and thawed briefly to add as last component The reaction mixture was kept on ice 5 minutes and 2 l were removed and counted in ASC scintillation fluid in order to determine the specific activity of the dCTP.The reaction mixture was then incubated 10 minutes at 460C. 20 l 0.2M EDTA pH 8.0 was added to stop the reaction, and the mixture was then extracted with an equal volume 1 1 phenol chloroform. 0.14 volume 80 glycerol was added and sample was chromatographed on a 0.7 x 17 cm. Sephadex G 100 column.Once the sample had entered the column, G100 buffer 10mMTris HCl, pH 8.0 1mM EDTA 100mM NaCl was added to the column and 5 drop about 275 l fractions were collected.The radioactive fractions were Cerenkov counted and the cDNA fractions comprising the peak counts per minute were pooled. The mRNA cDNA hybrids were precipitated by adding 0.1 volume 2.4M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes 95 ethanol, placing in a dry ice ethanol bath for 30 minutes, then pelleting by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, 4 C, for 20 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in 300 l 0.1M NaOH and heated at 700C for 20 minutes to hydrolyze the RNA, leaving single stranded cDNA. 30 l 1M HC1 were added to neutralize the solution. The DNA was precipitated by adding 5g tRNA, 1 10 volume 2.4M sodium acetate, and 2.5 volumes 95 ethanol, placing in a dry ice ethanol bath 10 minutes, and centrifuging in a microfuge 10 minutes at 40C. The pellet was resuspended in the following mix 40 l 0.5M potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 8 l 0.25M MgCl2 2 P 1 0.1M dithiothreitol 1 l 0.05M dATP, pH 7.0 1 l 0.05M dCTP, pH 7.0 1 l 0.05M dGTP, pH 7.0 11 0.05M TTP, pH 7.0 124 l sterile dH2O 178 lNext, added 22 l DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment 5 l, available from Boehringer Mannheim. The reaction mixture was then incubated in a 150C water bath for 12 hours. 20p1 0.2M EDTA pH 8.0 was added to stop the reaction and the mixture was extracted with an equal volume 1 1 phenol chloroform. 0.14 volume glycerol was added to the aqueous phase. The sample, which now contains double stranded cDNA, was run over a Sephadex G100 column and the peak cDNA fractions were pooled and precipitated as before.The double stranded DNA has a 3 hairpin loop as previously described, which was removed with S1 nuclease as follows. The pellet was resuspended in 72 l sterile distilled water and then 18 l 5X S1 buffer 1M NaCl 0.25M sodium acetate, pH 4.5 SmM ZnS04 2.5 glycerol were added. An enzyme mix was prepared by adding 2.5 l 50 units of S1 nuclease 20 g l to 47.5 ul 1X S1 buffer. 10 l of enzyme mix was added to the 90V1 DNA solution then incubated at 37iC 20 minutes.Addition of 20 ul 0.2M sodium EDTA stopped the reaction, and the reaction mixture was extracted with an equal volume 1 1 phenol chloroform. The aqueous phase was loaded onto a 5 258 sucrose gradient and spun at 38,000 rpm 17.5 hours 5iC in an ultracentrifuge. One ml fractions were collected and Cerenkov counted. Fractions were pooled with fractions 1 6, 7 9.and 10 12 comprisinq the 3 pools. Fraction 1 was the fraction taken from the bottom of the qradient. DNA was precipitated bv adding 0.1 volume 2.4M sodium acetate, 12 ug tRNA, and 2.5 volumes 95 ethanol to each pool, then placing them at 20eC overnight. The DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 25K for 30 minutes at 4C. After slightly dessicating pellets, the DNA from each pool was resuspended in 200 l dH2O and precipitated again with ethanol and sodium acetate. Pellets were resuspended in 22P1 dH2O and spun in a microfuge 5 minutes to pellet insoluble matter. 2P 1 of each cDNA containing supernatant were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6 polyacrylamide gel.Autoradiography of the gel showed that the DNA in the pool of fractions 1 6 had an average size of 1100 base pairs bp and included DNA in the 200 bp range and this pool was chosen for addition of polyC tails to the 3 ends of the cDNA, using, generally, the homopolymeric tailing procedure described in McCandliss et al., page 601 et seq., supra. A 5000 molar excess of dCTP over 3 cDNA ends was found to give good results. The reaction mixture was as follows 20P1 cDNA about 43 ng 3H dCTP 645 pmol, lyophilized 2.4oil 10X TdT buffet 1.6us dH2O 24.0 l 10X TdT buffer 1.4M potassium cacodylate 0.3M Tris HC1, pU 7.0 10mM CoC12 lmM DTT The reaction mixture was preincubated to 37 C for 2 minutes, 2P1 were removed for use in calculations, then 2P 6.66 units P L Biochemicals terminal deoxynucleo tidyl transferase were added and incubation at 37 C was continued for 5 minutes.Calculations based on incorporation of 3H dCTP indicated that the 3 ends of the cDNA now carried polyC tails an average of 14 nucleotides in length. 80 l T.E. buffer l0mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6 lmM EDTA were added to the DNA and the solution was extracted with an equal volume of 1 1 phenol chloroform. The organic phase was then retracted with 100p1 dH2O and the two aqueous phases were combined. The C tailed double stranded cDNA was then annealed to plasmid pBR322 DNA which had been linearized with the restriction endonuclease PstI, then G tailed by the homopolymeric tailing method. The complementary singlestranded C and G tails will anneal, producing recombinant plasmids with cDNA inserts at the PstI site. 200 l cDNA, C tailed 39.2 ng 10.5p1 pBR322 PstI, G tailed 302 ng 93 l 10X buffer 626.5 iil dH2O 930 l The reaction mix was placed in an insulated water bath at 70 C. The bath was then transferred to a 37 C room and allowed to cool slowly to 370C overnight, then transferred to room temperature, where the bath cooled to 30 C over several hours. The reaction mixture was then stored at 4 C. lOX annealing buffer 1.5M NaCl 100mM Tris HCl, pH7.5 l0mM EDTA E. coli HB101 cells were made competent for transformation by known calcium chloride treatment procedures. 200 l aliquots of competent HB101 cells were each combined with 40 l of the annealing reaction mixture and kept on ice 20 minutes, then heat shocked at 42 C for 2 minutes. 2.8 mls Luria broth were added to each tube and incubated at 370C for 1 hour. The tubes contents were aliquoted 1 2 ml aliquots into tubes containing Luria broth plus 0.7 agar, and then were poured onto Luria broth agar plates containing 25g ml tetracycline and incubated at 37 C until colonies appeared. Only those cells transformed by pBR322 with or without a cDNA insert can grow on tetracycline plates.Approximately 2500 transformant colonies grew on the plates. EXAMPLE III Isolation of a Full Length HSA cDNA The transformants were initially screened with a rat serum albumin RSA cDNA fragment. The RSA cDNA fragment was obtained from a pBR322 plasmid containing a 2000 bp RSA cDNA insert. This recombinant plasmid is similar to, but contains a longer cDNA insert than, the plasmid prAlbI described in Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA, 76, 4370 1979 . A 1480 bp rat serum albumin RSA fragment was isolated by digesting the plasmid carrying the RSA cDNA with the restriction endonuclease BstII all restriction endonucleases used in these examples were used according to manufacturer s specifications. The fragment was then radioactively labeled with a32P by the nick translation procedure Maniatis et al. PNASUSA, 72 3961 1975 . About 80 10 ml cultures of individual transformants were grown and plasmid DNA was isolated by known plasmid mini prepn procedures. The partially purified plasmidDNAs were subjected to electrophoresis on 0.8 agarose gels. The DNA was transferred from the gels to nitrocellulose filters using the Southern blotting technique Southern, E.M. J. Molec. Biology 98, 503 1975 . The nitrocellulose filters were immersed for 2 hours at 42C in prehybridization solution 50 formamide 5X SSC 0.05M NaPO4, pB 6.5 5X Denhardt s 100g ml salmon sperm DNA . The filters were then transferred into hybridization solution 50 formamide 10 dextran sulfate 5X SSC 20mM NaPO4, pH 6.5 1X Denhardt s 50jig ml salmon sperm DNA. The nicktranslated 1480bp RSA fragment prepared above was heated at 100 C for 5 minutes, then quick cooled on ice, and this probe was added to the hybridization solution at 2 X 105 cpm probe per ml of solution. The filters were incubated in the hybridization solution at 420C for 18 hours, then washed twice in 2XSSC and once in 0.1X SSC at room temperature. Autoradiography of the filters revealed nonspecific hybridization of the probe to all plasmid DNAs.Therefore, several Southern blot filters were washed in 2XSSC at various temperatures from 65 C to 80 C. DNA from one plasmid on a filter washed at 65 C hybridized strongly with the probe. DNA sequencing revealed that the positive clone, called 6C3, was a partial length human serum albumin clone. Plasmid DNA was isolated from a culture of 6C3 and digested with the restriction endonuclease PstI. One of the resulting HSA cDNA fragments, about 475bp in length, was isolated and nick translated for use as a 50X Denhardt s stock 1 polyvinylpyrrolidone l ficoll 1 bovine serum albumin. lXSSC 150mM NaCl 1SmM sodium citrate, pH 6.8 with citric acid probe. The entire bank of approximately 2500 clones was screened with this probe using a modification of the hybridization procedure of Grunstein et al., supra. The transformant colonies were individually picked from the plates into separate wells in 96 well microtiter plates containing Luria broth plus 0.2 glucose plus 25pg ml tetracycline and incubated at 370C ovenight.Using a transfer device with 48 metal prongs, samples of each culture were transferred to two Luria broth agar tetracycline plates, one plate previously overlaid with a nitrocellulose filter, and incubated at 37 C 2 days. The filters were then placed successively on Whatman filter paper soaked in one of the following solutions 0.5M NaOH lMTris, pH7.4 1M Tris, pH7.4 2XSSC 90 ethanol, and 90 ethanol in that order, 7 minutes per solution. The nitrocellulose filters were then baked in vacuo at 80eC for 2 hours. Prehybridization and hybridization procedures were as described above, except that the three washes were at room temperature. 90 positive hybridization signals were detected by autoradiography. Some of the positive clones were further analyzed by restriction analysis e.g. PstI digestion and hybridization of Southern blots as above. A clone bearing a full length HSA cDNA was identified and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The recombinant plasmid containing this HSA cDNA insert was termed pGX401 and is shown in figure 4. A partial restriction map of the HSA cDNA is shown in Figure 1, while Figure 2 shows the DNA sequence 5 3 strand of the cloned gene and the amino acid sequence it specifies. A sample of E. coli HB101 transformed with pGX401 has been deposited at the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture Northern Regional Research Center in Peoria, Illinois, under accessiÏn number NRRL B 15784. EXAMPLE IV DNA Sequence Analysis of HSA cDNA Prepared from Human Liver Samples Taken from Different Individuals In comparing the DNA sequence of the HSA cDNA insert in pGX401 Example III with the cDNA sequences published by Lawn et al., supra, and Dugaiczyk et al., supra, two codon differences were found that predict amino acid differences. The pGX401 sequence and the sequence reported by Lawn et al. indicated that codon 97 of the mature protein was GAG glutamic acid , whileDugaiczyk et al. reported it to be GGG glycine . In the pGX401 sequence and the sequence reported by Dugaiczyk codon 396 also was reported to be GAG glutamic acid , and Lawn et al. reported that codon to be AAG lysine . To gain some insight into whether these differences represented true protein polymorphisms or merely experimental artifacts, the DNA sequence in the regions of codons 97 and 396 was determined for several new independent HSA genes. Messenger RNA mRNA was isolated from normal human liver tissue taken from four different individuals. The procedures of Example I were followed except that sucrose gradient fractionation of oligo dT cellulose purified mRNA was omitted. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from this mRNA template by the procedures described in Example 11 and poly dC tails were added according toDeng and Wu, NAR 9 4123, 1981. The vector into which the dC tailed cDNA was inserted was plasmid pGX1066. This plasmid comprises the phage AtRl transcription terminator upstream of a bank of ten closely spaced unique restriction sites, which in turn is upstream of the A4S transcription terminator. E. coli strain GX1170 F leu hsdR thi supE gal 1,2 lac xyl ara trpC9830 lacIq transformed with pGX1066 has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection,Rockville, Maryland, as ATCC No. 39955. Plasmid pGX1066 was linearized with PstI and poly dG tails were added using the homopolymeric tailing method described by Deng and Wu Nucleic Acids Res., 9 4173 1981 . The vector DNA and cDNA were then annealed as described in Example II. E. coli strain DH1 cells F , endAl, hsdR17 Rk , Mk , supE44, thil, X , recAl, gyrA96, relAl were made competent and transformed with the annealing reaction mix. Both E. coli strain DHl and the transformation procedure used are described by D.Hanahan J. Molec. Biol., 166 557 1983 . Transformants were plated on LM plates 1 w v Bacto tryptone, 0.5 w v yeast extract, l0mM Nail, l0mM MgS04B7H20, 1.5 w v Bacto agar with 35pg ml ampicillin added. Transformed E. coli colonies were screened for the presence of HSA sequences by Grunstein Hogness filter hybridization Gergen et al., 1979, Nuc. Acids. Res.7 2115 Wallace et al., 1981, Nuc. Acids Res. 9 879 using kinased oligomers or nick translated HSA cDNA fragments as probes. For identification of clones carrying HSA cDNA containing codon 396, a synthetic oligonucleotide, 5 TTGTACTCTCCAAGCTGC 3 , corresponding to codons 397 402 and the last nucleotide of codon 396 was used. For detection of clones carrying HSA cDNA containing codon 97, either of two synthetic oligonucleotides, 5 TCTCTTCATTGTCATGAAAAGC 3 , corresponding to codons 126 132 and one nucleotide of codon 133 , or 5 TTCTTGTTTTGCACAGC 3 , corresponding to codons 90 last 2 nucleotides 95, or a nick translatedHSA fragment derived from pGX401 , corresponding to codons 1 to 364 was used.Upon identification of clones containing the HSA sequence of interest, restriction fragments were subcloned into an M13 phage. HSA cDNAcarrying phage were identified by screening plaques according to the procedure of Benton and Davis Science, 196 180 1977 . The DNA sequence was determined with these M13 clones by the dideoxy method Biggin et al.,Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 80 3963 1983 . By the procedures described above, transformants containing HSA cDNA that included codon 396 were derived from all four human livers. Transformants containing HSA cDNA that included codon 97 were derived from only two of the four livers. The DNA sequence in all cases including 60 to 100 base pairs on each side of the codon in question matched the sequence determined for pGX401. Messenger RNA then was isolated from normal human liver samples taken from two more individuals, and the sequence at codon 97 was determined using a modification of the Sanger sequencing procedure in which reverse transcriptase was used to copy the single stranded RNA template. A synthetic oligonucleotide, 5 TGTCTCTTCATTGTCATGAAAAGC 3 , corresponding to codons 126 133, was used as a primer.The mRNA, purified by oligo dT cellulose chromatography as previously described, was incubated in a reaction volume of 2111 containing 10 mM Tris . HC1 pH 8.3 , 140 mM KC1, 10 mMMgCl2, 20 mM 6 mercaptoethanol, 1.6 mM dNTP, 0.2 mM ddNTP, 250 ng RNA, 5 ng kinased primer and 1.88 units reverse transcriptase Life Sciences, Inc. . After overlaying the solution with 4 iil of mineral oil the reaction was incubated at 42 C for fifteen minutes and was terminated by the addition of 7 lll of 250 mM Na2EDTA. The mineral oil was extracted with ether and removed with a drawn out pasteur pipette. Formamide loading buffer was added to the samples prior to electrophoresis on a urea sequencing gel. The gels were run until the bromphenol blue tracking dye had migrated to the bottom. They then were dried under vacuum and exposed to X ray film with two intensifying screens for periods between twelve hours and several days. The HSA sequence at codon 97 for both liver samples was identical to the sequence at codon 97 in pGX401. See Figure 5. The reliability of the technique to determine nucleotide sequence from mRNA was evaluated using polyA RNA prepared from the liver that was the source of the cDNA originally cloned in pGX401. The results Figure 5 showed that the sequence determined in this manner was identical to the sequence originally determined in pGX401.
