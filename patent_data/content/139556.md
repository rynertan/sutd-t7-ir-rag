# Process for producing ion implanted bubble device.

## Abstract
A process for producing an ion implanted bubble device having bubble propagation tracks formed by implanting ions in a magnetic layer formed on a substrate. The process includes a step for implanting ions in the magnetic layer 2 for forming a desirable bubble propagation track 6 thereon a step for exposing the ion implanted magnetic layer to plasma in order to enhance the anisotropy field change Î”Hk a step for coating an intermediate insulation film 7 over the magnetic layer treated with plasma and a step for forming bubble propagation patterns 10 of ferromagnetic material and or conductor patterns 8 of conductive material on the intermediate insulation film.
