## Description
GLYPHOSATE TYPE HERBICIDAL COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR USE This invention relates to improved glyphosatetype herbicidal compositions. Glyphosate N phosphonomethyl glycine and its salts are well known broad spectrum herbicides active against both annual and perennial weeds. This class of herbicides is especially known for its post emergent herbicidal effectiveness against grasses and is used for both large scale agricultural applications and also for home and garden type applications. For home and garden applications the glyphosate herbicides suffer the disadvantage that they are relatively slow acting especially against certain difficult to kill weed and grass species, such as Bermuda grass. Thus, the common home and garden purchaser is frequently prone to use repeated applications of the herbicide where only one applicaton is necessary because they have failed to see any change in the weeds or undesired vegetation within the first few days or week. This problem is even more accentuated because the glyphosates act more effectively against mature plants than against young plants and most home and garden weed clean up is done in the early growing season and hence against young plants. An extensive review of Glyphosate and RelatedChemistry is set forth by J. E. Franz in IUPAC Advances inPesticide Chemistry Gassbuhler Ed. 1978 Zurich . The synthesis and or use of glyphosate type herbicides is described in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,799,758 3,835,000 3,868,407 3,950,402 4,083,893 4,147,719 andEuropean Patent Application No. 19,384. U.S. PatentNo. 3,929,450 teaches that the herbicidal effectiveness ofN phosphonomethyl glycines can be increased by applying them with certain N phosphonic acids. Farm ChemicalsHandbook 1982 at page C 254 teaches that the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate may be tank mixed with Lasso atrazine, Princep , Lorox , Lexone and Sencor for use in certain minimum tillage systems. It has also been suggested to tank mix trifluralin i.e., l trifluoromethyl 3,5 dinitro 4 dipropylaminobenzene with the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate The words Lasso , SPrincep and Lorox are Trade Marks. Acifluorfen, i.e. 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl phenoxy 2 nitrobenzoic acid and its salts, are well known agricultural herbicides which may be applied for selective pre and post emergence control of annual broad leaf weeds and grasses in agricultural crops such as soybeans, peanuts, and other large seeded legumes. These herbicides are generally more active against broad leaf weeds than grasses and are principally applied as postemergent herbicides. The preparation and use of such herbicides are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,063,929.This patent also generally teaches that such herbicides can be applied in combination with other herbicides including a number of herbicides described in columns 6, 7 and 8 thereof. Oxyfluorfen i.e. 2 chloro 1 3 ethoxy 4 nitrophenoxy 4 trifluoromethyl benzene is another diphenyl ether type agricultural herbicide designed for pre and post emergence control of a number of species of broad leaf weeds and grasses in crops such as soybean, corn, cotton, etc. see Farm Chemicals Handbook 1981 p. C 165 . Bifenox i.e. methyl 5 2,4 dichlorophenyloxy 2 nitrobenzoate is designed for pre and post agricultural herbicide applications particularly for broad leaf control. It has also been suggested to use bifenox in overlay with trifluralin, paraquats or the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate see Farm Chemicals Handbook 1981 p. C 226 . Other diphenyl ether herbicides include nitrofen i.e., 2,4 dichlorophenyl p nitrophenyl ether and chlomethoxynil i.e., 2,4 dichlorophenyl 3 methoxy 4 nitrophenyl ether . Various diphenyl ether type herbicides are also described in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,652,645 3,979,437 4,093,446 4,164,409 4,192,669 4,220,468 and BritishPatent Specification No. 1,521,472. It has now been surprisingly discovered that by combining oxyfluorfen type herbicides with glyphosate type herbicides, the phytotoxic efficacy and the speed of phytotoxic action are increased. Further, the composition also provides excellent residual control of vegetation.Also, against certain difficult to kill weed or grass species, such as Bermuda grass, this increased speed of action is synergistic. Moreover, this enhanced speed of phytotoxic action does not produce any loss in overall effectiveness. This is especially surprising because the overall effectiveness of glyphosates is generally dependent upon a relatively large amount of foliage contact and trans location of glyphosate to the vital organs of the plant, whereas oxyfluorfen type herbicides are known to cause cell rupture burning and would be expected to reduce translocation, causing poorer overall glyphosate effectiveness, typically manifested by regrowth. Contrary to this, no significant, if any, loss in effectiveness or increased regrowth was observed for the present composition. For the reasons already noted above, this increased speed of action is especially desirable in home and garden herbicidal applications. Since the herbicidal action will now be more rapidly observable, this in turn should obviate the tendency of the home gardener to use unnecessary repeated applications of the herbicide. In agricultural large scale applications the increased speed of action is, of course, desirable but of less importance because of the sophistication of those applying the herbicides and their awareness of the time required for the herbicide to take effect. The excellent residual control exhibited by this composition is especially desirable for applications in which no regrowth is desired such as, for example, along fence lines and the edges of grass landscapes. According to one aspect of the invention, a herbicidal composition comprises a post emergent herbicidally effective amount of a glyphosate type herbicide as hereinafter defined an amount of oxyfluorfen and or a lower alkyl homolog thereof as hereinafter defined , effective to increase the post emergence herbicidal speed of phytotoxic action of said glyphosate type herbicide, and a compatible carrier. The invention also comprises a concentrate form cation comprising the aforementioned glyphosate type herbicide and oxyfluorfen or homolog thereof. According to another aspect of the invention, a method of destroying vegetation comprises applying a herbicidally effective amount of a glyphosate type herbicide in combination with an amount of oxyfluorfen and or compatible salts thereof, effective to increase the post emergence herbicidal speed of action of said glyphosate herbicide, to the foliage and or stems of said vegetation. Methods of preparing the aforementioned herbicidal compositions are also encompassed within the invention. The glyphosate type compounds used in the present invention include compounds represented byFormulae I and Ia hereinbelow and also compounds which are metabolized by green plants to such compounds or more generally, to the phytotoxic functional equivalent of the compounds of Formulae I and IaEMI4.1 wherein Z is cyano or the group COOR wherein R is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxyalkyl, aryl having 6 to 10 carbon atoms or substituted aryl having 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halo, trifluoromethyl, nitro, and cyano, or a compatible salt forming cation R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen lower alkyl aryl substituted aryl biphenyl or a compatible salt forming cation.

With respect to Formulae I and Ia, the preferred compounds are those wherein Z and zl are COOR and COOR , respectively. When Z in Formula I is COOR, R is preferably hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxyalkyl or a compatible salt forming cation, whilst R1 and 1 2 are preferably independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl having 1 or 2 substituents selected from alkyl, alkoxy and halo, or a compatible salt forming cation. With respect to Formula I, the preferred compounds are those wherein R, R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen or a compatible salt forming cation. The organic ammonium salts of Formula I , for example, wherein R is isopropyl amine cation, yield very good results and are commercially available. The organic sulfonium and sulfoxide salts, for example, wherein R1 and or R2 are trimethyl sulfonium cation or trimethyl sulfoxide cation are also desirable.With respect to Formula Ia, the preferred compounds are those wherein R and R2 are independently lower alkyl or aryl and Z is COOR wherein R is lower alkyl or aryl. Compatible cations and compatible anions refer respectively to cations and anions which yield the salt form of the compounds of Formula I and Ia , respectively, and which do not significantly adversely affect the herbicidal properties of the compound. Typically, the salt form is more water soluble than the free acid or base form and is hence desirable for formulation and application purposes. Suitable compatible cations include, for example, cations of alkali metals, e.g. sodium, potassium, alkaline earth metals, e.g. calcium, magnesium copper, zinc, iron, nickel manganese, ammonium, and organic ammonium cat ions, organic phosphonium cations and organic sulfonium and sulfoxide cations preferably having molecular weights below about 300. Suitable organic ammonium cations include cations derived from amines, including cyclic and heterocyclic amines containing 1 or 2 amine groups and includes, for example, alkyl amines, alkylene amines, alkene amines, and alkanol amines.Illustrative species of such amines include, for example methylamine, ethylamine, n propylamine, isopropylamine, n butylamine, isobutylamine, sec butylamine, n amylamine, isoamylamine, hexylamine, heptylamine, octylamine, nonylamine, decylamine, undecylamine, dodecylamine, tridecylamine, tetradecylamine, pentadecylamine, hexadecylamine, heptadecylamine, octadecylamine, methylethylamine, methylisopropylamine, methyhexylamine, methylnonylamine, methylpentadecylamine, methyloctadecylamine, ethylbutylamine, ethylheptylamine, ethyloctylamine, hexylheptylamine, hexyloctylamine, dimethylamine, diethylamine, di n propylamine, diisopropylamine, di n amylamine, diisoamylamine, dihexylamine, di heptylamine, dioxtylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri n propylamine, triisopropylamine, tri n butylamine, triisobytylamine, tri secbutylamine, tri n amylamine, ethanolamine, n propanolamine, isopropanolamine, diethanolamine, N,N diethylethanolamine, N ethylpropanolamine, N butylethanolamine, allylamine, n butenyl 2 amine, n pentenyl 2 amine, 2,3 dimethylbutenyl 2 amine, di butenyl 2 amine, n hexenyl 2amine and propylenediamine, primary aryl amines such as aniline, methoxyaniline, ethoxyaniline, o,m,p toluidine, phenylenediamine, 2,4,6 tribromoaniline, benzidine, naph thylarnine and o,m,p chloroaniline and heterocyclic amines such as pyridine, morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, indoline and azepine. Suitable organic sulfonium and sulfoxide cations include, for example, C1 C10 alkyl, preferably lower alkyl, sulfonium and C1 C10 alkyl, preferably lower alkyl, sulfoxide cations, for example, trimethylsulfonium ethyldimethylsulfonium tripropylsulfonium trimethylsulfoxide and triethylsulfoxide. Suitable procedures for preparing such salts are for example described in U.S.Patent No. 4,315,765, Suitable phosphonium cations include those having the formulaEMI7.1 wherein Ra, Rb, Rc and Rd are independently C1 C10 alkyl or phenyl, and preferably are lower alkyl. Suitable procedures for preparing such salts are, for example, described in U.S. Patent No. 4,341,549. Examples of various suitable cation salt forms are also described in U.S. Patent No. 3,799,758. Suitable compatible anions include, for example, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluoride, sulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, orthophosphate, carbonate, bicarbonate, acetate, butyrate, benzoate, and maleate. The compounds of Formulae I and Ia are generally known compounds and can be prepared by known methods, such as, for example, described in U.S, PatentsNos. 3,799,758 3,835,000 3,950,402 4,067,719 4,008,296 4,252,554 4,147,719 and 4,369,142 or by obvious modifications of known procedures. A wide variety of compounds which are metabolized by green plants or functionally equate to the phytoxic active moiety of glyphosate can be alss used.Such compounds include, for example, the compounds represented by the following formulae which also encompass the compounds of Formulae I and Ia above EMI8.1 wherein M, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined hereinabove z2 is CH2CN CONHOH or its tautomer, i.e. C OH NOH CH2COOR wherein R is hydrogen, a compatible salt forming cation, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxyalkyl, aryl or substituted aryl or CONR7R8 whereinR7 and R8 are independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxyalkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, or a compatible salt forming cation Z3 is CH2CN CONHOH C OH NOH or its tautomer CH2COOR wherein R is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxyalkyl, aryl or substituted aryl or CONR71R81 wherein R71 and R8 are independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxyalkyl, aryl or substituted aryl wherein R5 is lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, hydroxy, lower alkanoyl, arylcarbonyl, substituted arylcarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl, lower alkylthioalkanoyl amino, alkylamino, nitro, nitroso, or a radical having the formula COOR9 OCH2COOR10 CH2PO OR11 OR21 S O R11 SO X R11 or COS O mR12 wherein R9 is lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, aryl, or substituted aryl R11 is lower alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl X is O or S R12 is lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, aryl, substituted aryl, lower arylalkyl, or substituted lower arylalkyl, m is 0, 1, or 2, and R11, R2 and R10 are independently selected from the group of substituents defined for R1 hereinabove R6 is hydrogen lower alkyl aryl substituted aryl lower arylalkyl lower substituted arylalkyl COOR , wherein R is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxyalkyl, aryl or substituted aryl or PO OR3 OR4 wherein R3 and R4 are as defined hereinabove. The compounds of Formulae IIb VII above are also generally known herbicidally active compounds and can be prepared by known procedures, or obvious modifications thereof e.g. substitutions of appropriate solvents and appropriately substituted starting materials . Such compounds and procedures are, for example, described in U.S.Patents Nos. 4,035,177 4,175,946 4,251,258 4,231,782 4,322,238 4,322,239 4,323,387 4,300,942 4,300,943 U.S. Research Disclosure No. 220,001, filed July 20, 1982 Derwent No. 73821 E 35 British Patent No. 2,090,596 Belgian Patent No. 888001 Derwent No. 71783 D 40 Japanese Patent No. 5 6139408 Derwent No. 91755 D 50 Japanese Patent No. 5 7099597 Derwent No. 62700 E 30 European Patent Application No. 39310 Derwent No. 83914D 46 German Patent Application No. 2,361,382 C.A 39571e Vol. 82, 1975 and Japanese Patent No. 5 7120595 Derwent No. 7120595 . The oxyfluorfen type compounds useful in the present invention can be represented by the formula EMI10.1 wherein R12 is lower alkyl. The compound of Formula VIII wherein R12 is ethyl is especially preferred as it affords very good results and is readily available commercially under the generic name oxyfluorfen . The compounds of Formula VIII are also generally known compounds and can be prepared by known procedures. The composition of the present invention comprises one or more glyphosate type compounds and an amount of one or more compounds of Formula VIII effective to improve phytotoxic action as compared with the glyphosatetype compound per Se. Typically, based on the two common forms of the compounds of Formula I and Formula VIII , i.e. the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate and oxyfluorfen, respectively, the composition of the present invention typically contains about from 0.3 to 4, preferably about from 0.5 to 3 parts by weight of CompoundVIII per part of Compound I. In terms of general mole equivalent ratios, typically about from 0.18 to 2.5, preferably 0.31 to 2, mole equivalents, based on oxyfluorfen i.e. Compound VIII wherein R12 is ethyl , of CompoundVIII is used per mole equivalent of glyphosate type compound, based on glyphosate i.e.Compound I wherein R, R1 and R3 are each H . Lower and higher ratios of CompoundVIII to the glyphosate type compound generally fail to produce a significant enhancement in the phytotoxic properties the glyphosate type compound or are not cost effective and can, in the case of higher ratios of compound VIII, reduce the overall effectiveness of the glyphosate type compound resulting in early regrowth. The composition is preferably applied in a diluted form comprising a compatible carrier and is generally applied in the same manner as glyphosate type herbicides and is effective against the same spectrum of broad leaf weeds and grasses. The increased speed of phytotoxicity afforded by the present composition is most dramatic in the early growing season on young broad leaf weeds and grasses and especially on difficult to kill species of weeds and grasses, such as creeping beggarweed, Bermuda grass, and bahiagrass. For example, in the case of Bermuda grass, the speed of phytotoxic action is even greater than the combined phytotoxic rates of glyphosate and oxyfluorfen. In the case of mature vegetation, the increase in speed of action afforded by the present invention is less dramatic because of the relative fast action afforded by glyphosates against mature plants. The composition can be formulated as a liquid, solid, wettable powder, or aerosol and can be supplied as a concentrate designed for dilution prior to application or can be supplied as a ready to use formulation. Generally, the composition is preferably applied to the vegetation as a liquid or aerosol. For ready to use applications the composition typically comprises from 0.15 to 1 wt percent, preferably 0.35 to 0.8 wt percent of active ingredients, based on isopropylamine salt of glyphosate plus oxyfluorfen preferably in the relative ratios prescribed hereinabove , with the remainder being compatible carrier optionally containing small amounts of suitable additives. The composition can also be formulated as a concentrate typically containing from 1 to 100 wt percent active ingredients i.e., glyphosatetype compound s plus oxyfluorfen type compound s in the prescribed ratio given hereinabove and the remainder compatible carrier optionally containing small amounts of suitable additives.Where the concentrate is formulated as a liquid it typically contains from 0.8 to 60 wt percent, preferably 1 to 55 wt percent, and more preferably, 1 to 50 wt percent, of said active ingredients and a compatible liquid carrier. Where the concentrate is supplied as a solid e.g., powder, granules the composition can be 100 wt percent typically 2 to 100 wt percent of said active ingredients or can optionally contain a compatible solid carrier preferably water soluble or water flowable . The term compatible carrier refers to carrier materials which are compatible with the herbicidally active ingredients and which do not significantly adversely affect their herbicidal properties save to dilute it. The composition can also contain small amounts, typically less than 1 to 5 wt percent, of various optional additives such as wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers and solvents. Examples of such additives and general glyphosate formulations are, for example, described in U.S. Patent No. 4,315,765. Suitable liquid carriers which can be used, include, for example, water, organic solvents, for example, benzene, toluene, kerosene, diesel fuel,fuel oil, and petroleum naphtha. Solid carriers can also be used but are generally less convenient than liquid carriers. Suitable solid carriers include, for example, fine clays, walnut shell flour, cottonseed hulls, wheat flour and wood flour. The present invention can also be applied as an aerosol containing the glyphosate type compound s andCompound s VIII in the prescribed ratio along with a suitable aerosol carrier, such as halogenated alkanes and optional additives. For home and garden use, the composition is preferably applied as a liquid formulation containing from 0.1 to 0.5, more preferably 0.2 to 0.4, weight percent of the glyphosate type compound based on the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate and from 0.05 to 0.5, more preferably 0.15 to 0.4, weight percent ofCompound VIII, based on oxyfluorfen. Also, for both home and garden use and also for larger scale use where long residual control is desired, we have found that best results, in terms of an advantageous combination of increased speed of phytotoxic and longer residual control of both grasses and broad leaf plants are obtained using a glyphosate type compound concentration of about 0.25 wt percent based on the glyphosate isopropylamine salt and a Compound VIII concentration of about 0.25 wt percent based on oxyfluorfen .Preferably, a salt of glyphosate e.g. the isopropylamine salt and oxyfluorfen are used as both and are readily available commercially and afford excellent results. Based on mole equivalents of glyphosate type compound and mole equivalents of Compound VIII, the liquid formulations preferably contain from 0.004 to 0.022, more preferably 0.009 to 0.018 gram mole equivalents, based on glyphosate isopropylamine salt, of the glyphosate type compound s and from 0.001 to 0.014, more preferably 0.004 to 0.011, gram mole equivalents, based on oxyfluorfen, of the oxyfluorfen compound s per kilogram of formulation. Very good results are obtained using about 0.011 mole equivalents, based on glyphosate isopropylamine salt, of glyphosate type compound and about 0.007 gram mole equivalents, based on oxyfluorfen, of the oxyfluorfen type compound per kilogram of formulation.The remainder of the liquid formulation is liquid carrier or solvent optionally containing suitable additives as explained above. Water is generally the preferred carrier when water soluble forms of the active compounds are used.Also, it is desirable to include a surfactant. The composition can also be formulated as an aerosol for home and garden applications having about the same concentration ranges of the glyphosate type compound s and oxyfluorfen type compound s as the liquid formulations described above. The formulation is then applied to the foliage and or stems of the vegetation, for example, by simple spraying. As in the case of conventional home and garden glyphosate formulations, best results are obtained when the foliage is thoroughly wetted with the formulation. The aforementioned compositions of the invention can be conveniently prepared by simple mixing or blending of the ingredients.

Prior to spraying the plots were clipped to 2 inches, the formulations were then applied to the foliage of the test plant with a trigger sprayer to give thorough coverage usng 25 ml of solution for each test plot. These tests were conducted in the state of Florida and were started in early April. At the time the formulations were applied, the temperature was about 200C to 230C with a relative humidity of 500C to 600C. The first rain occurred two days after the spraying. The plants were periodically observed and rated for phytotoxic effects and physiological response to the treatment. A rating scale of 0 to 100 was used, 0 representing no phytotoxicity and 100 representing complete kill. The results are reported in Table 1 hereinbelow as the average of the three replicates.

This is shown by the increased phytotoxicity shown in the 4 to 14 day period after application as compared with glyphosate alone. The compositions of the present invention also exhibited excellent residual control. The increase in speed of phytotoxicity is perhaps more surprising in the case of grasses since glyphosate is well recognized to already have exceptional activity against grasses and lesser activity against broad leaf weed. Whereas oxyfluorfen is known to have better activity against broad leaf weed and only relatively modest activity against grasses. Moreover, in the case of difficult to control Bermuda grass, at the low glyphosate dosage i.e., 0.12 weight percent glyphosate this increase in speed of phytotoxicity and phytotoxicity effectiveness was greater than the result obtained by the raw summation of the phytotoxicity for glyphosate and oxyfluorfen at those concentrations and times.
