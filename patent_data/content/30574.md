## Description
Electrical Connector and Method of Manufacture. This invention relates to electrical connectors for interconnecting spaced printed circuit boards and comprising a conductive connecting spring element having contacts at opposite ends and embedded ih elastomeric material with the contacts exposed at opposite surfaces of the elastomeric material. The invention also relates to the method of manufacture of such a connector. Connectors of this kind have been proposed, for example, in US patents 3,795,037, 3,795,884 and 4,016,647. It is an object of the invention to provide a connector capable of operating with low contact resistance and capable of withstanding shock, particularly thermal shock without loss of contact integrity. In a connector of the kind specified according to the invention the connecting element comprises two generally S shaped spring portions extending from a central bight, free ends of the string portions having extensions defining the contacts, the element being embedded between layers of elastomeric material within the contacts exposed at opposite sides of the resultant elastomeric body. A method of making such a connector comprises forming a series of contact elements from sheet metal to extend laterally from an integral carrier rail, enibedding the series of contact elements between layers of elastomeric material with the contacts and the carrier rail exposed, and severing the carrier rail from the elements. The invention rill now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying partly diagram atic drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective fragmentary, partially sectional exploded view of a connector sandwiched between two circuit boards Figure 2 is a perspective fragmentary view of a strip of connecting elements in a preliminary stage of manufacture of the connector of Fig l Figure 3 is a schematic view illustrating a step in the manufacture of the connector of Fig.l Figure 4 is a fragmentary perspective view of the strip of connecting elements embedded between strips of elastomeric material during an intermediate step in the manufacture of the connector Figure 5 is a side elevation of a modified connecting element, and Figure 6 is a fragmentary, perspective exploded view of an alternative connector assembly. The assembly of Figure 1 comprises a connector 10 positioned in sandwich fashion between upper and lower circuit boards 14, 12. The connector 10 comprises a stack of composite laminates 16 stacked in side by side fashion and clamped together between end walls 50. Each laminate 16 comprises an evenly spaced series of connecting elements 18 embedded between two layers 20 of elastomeric material, and is of strip like form with contact portions 32 of the contact elements 18 projecting from opposite sides of the strip, and from upper and lower surfaces of the elastomeric body defined by the stack of laminates. Each connecting element 18 comprises an elongated sinuous spring form 26, as seen more clearly in Figure 2, consisting of two S shaped portions 28 extending from opposite sides of a central bight 30 of larger curvature than smaller bights separating limbs of the S shaped portions 28 which extend in generally spaced parallel coplanar relation. Free ends of the S shaped portions 28 are formed with extensions at bights 34 outwardly inclined to terminate at oppositely directed contact portions 32 disposed centrally of the width of contact element 18. In the modified contact element of Figure 5, the contacts 32 are connected by a short circuit wire, welded at its ends to the contact portions 32 and adapted to provide a shorter, lower impedance, circuit path between the contacts. Referring back to Figure 1, the laminates 16 are arranged in groups 1 to 4, each group comprising three laminates secured together with the contact portions 32 of each laminate staggered lengthwise of the strip like laminates in relation to the contact portions of the other strips of the group, so that, as indicated by arrows t8 each contact 32 is adapted to engage a different circuit pad 46 on the circuit boards 12, 14. The groups 1 to 4 are suitably relatively positioned in relation to the pattern of circuit pads t6, to enable interconnection of complementary circuit pads 46 of respective boards 12, 14. As shown in Figure 2, the contact elements 18 are suitably stamped and formed from sheet metal in ladder strip form 21, with a series of elements 18 extending between a pair of carrier rails 22 integrally connected to the contact extensions by severable links 24. The liners extend from the bights 34, remote from the contact portions 32, and are inclined away from the contact portions 32.The ladder strip 21 may be of indefinite length, and wound upon a reel to facilitate handling during manufacture of the connector as described below. Suitable metals are stainless steel, plated spring steel and beryllium copper. In the method of manufacture schematically illustrated in Figure 3, a continuous strip 45 of lan inate for cutting into individual composite laminates 16 is prepared from a reel 38 of ladder strip 21 of connecting elements 18 and two reels 42 of strip form elastomeric material 20. The strip 21 is fed through a welding station 40 where, if desired, short circuit wires are welded between the contacts 32 of each element 18, according to theFigure 5 embodiment. The strips 20 of elastomeric material are fed to opposite sides of the strip 21 to form a composite strip 20, 21, 20 which passes through a bonding station 44 where the strips 20 are bonded together to embed the contact elements 18, as shown in Figure 4, with the carrier rails 22 spaced from marginal portions of the strips 20, and with the contacts 32, and portions of the links 24 exposed. The composite strip 45 is then suitably fed through a severing and cutting station, not shown, where the links 24 are severed adjacent the margins of the elastomeric strips 20, and desired lengths of laminate 16 are cut from the continuous strip 45.The lengths of laminate 16 may then be stacked to form the assembly ofFigure 1. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 6, a connector assembly 52 comprises laminates 16, each cut from the continuous strip 45 to include a single contact element 18, and the laminates being stacked to form a connector assembly with a single row of contact elements 18, defining a row of contacts 32 at opposite sides. Various elastomeric materials may be used for the strips 20 to form the composite laminate 16, for example polyurethane rubber. The elastic characteristics of the material will influence the spring characteristics of the contact elements 18. In the process of bonding the elastomeric strips about the contact elements, the material may be caused to flow, for example if the material is thermoplastic, so that the contact elements are contained in an elastomeric body without voids. Alternatively the strips 20 may be bonded to define pockets within which the elements 18 are contained. The latter structure allows for flexure of the spring elements 18 independently of the elastomeric material.
