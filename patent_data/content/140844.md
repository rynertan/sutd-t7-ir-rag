# LEVEL MEASURING DEVICE FOR LIQUIDS, PARTICULARLY FOR CONTROLLING LUBRICANT LEVEL IN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

## Abstract
A detector probe 4 is at least partially immersed in the liquid of which it is desired to detect the level, and carries an associated electrical heating element 5 , a pair of thermo electric sensors 6, 7 , one of which 6 detects the tem perature level reached by the heating element 5 when the latter is energised. The two sensors 6, 7 are connected in an electrical measuring circuit 11 to 16 which, in dependence on the difference between the temperature levels detected by the two sensors 6, 7 , permits the identification and sig nalling 16 of the occurrence of a situation in which the dis sipation by the liquid of the heat generated by the heating element 5 is reduced as a result of the lowering of the level of the liquid.
