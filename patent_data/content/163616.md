# Tubular elements and joints for their mutual articulated connection to form a partition wall of variable shape.

## Abstract
A self supporting wall is formed by assembling tubular elements 1, 1 with a longitudinal portion 5 having a concave arc shaped cross section by means of joints 3, 4, 7 being link plates to two different types. One type 3 , with a central raised portion 17 and two bored pins 10 , and the other 4 , with a lower spacer member 18 and two dead end hole pins 11 , alternatively link together the elements 1, 1 placed side by side, through plug members 2 adapted to fit into a central passage 23 of each element 1 and to be coupled to said pins 10, 11 of the plates 3, 4 . The partition wall can thus assume a variety of polygonal or arc shaped patterns with no need of be anchored to the floor or to the ceiling.
