# TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED VALVE

## Abstract
A control valve used as a steam trap including a flexible flow adjustment restriction device 66 , such as a flexible tube 67 , with a chamber 54 filled with a control fluid having a high co efficient of thermal expansion and a heat conduction configuration 58 conveying heat from the flow to the control fluid, such that a change in the flow tempera ture causes expansion or contraction of the control fluid to adjust the flexible flow adjustment member 66 to provide a universal steam trap.
