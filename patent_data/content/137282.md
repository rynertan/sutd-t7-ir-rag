# ELECTRO MECHANICALLY CONTROLLED EGR VALVE AND METHOD

## Abstract
An EGR system 12 and method for controlling the amount of exhaust gas recirculation flow between an exhaust gas conduit and the intake manifold having a plurality of solenoid actuated valves 22 situated in a conduit linking the exhaust gas system and the intake manifold having associated with each of the plurality of solenoid responsive valves 22 an orifice 70 sized to permit the flow of a predetermined though different fraction of the total desired exhaust gas flow including means of activating particular solenoids in a predetermined order such that the desired composite flow through the orifices is achieved.
