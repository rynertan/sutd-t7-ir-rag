# Refractory gun mix.

## Abstract
A refractory gun mix contains from 1 to 5 alkali metal phosphate, for example monosodium phosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, or a long chain glassy polyphosphate, from 0.5 to 5 hydrated aluminum sulfate e.g., Al₂ SO₄ ₃. 14H₂O , from 0.5 to 5 bentonite, and up to 10 pitch, preferably hard pitch, the balance being sized refrac tory grain, preferably MgO containing and or CaO containing grain such as periclase, chrome ore, and or dolomite. In a preferred embodiment, the alkali metal phosphate contributes three atoms of phosphorous for each atom of aluminum contributed by the aluminum sulfate.
