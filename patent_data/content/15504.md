# Centrifuge rotor.

## Abstract
A centrifuge rotor is described which facilitates the preparation of cell dispersions on microscope slides. The rotor is bowl like in configuration and defines an annular channel 20 having plural circumferentially disposed septa 24 . The septa provide plural separate regions each adapted to receive removable chambers 22 . The outer wall 18 in each region is flat to accommodate a microscope slide 30 . Each chamber has an outlet orifice 92 adapted to contact the microscope slide. A sample containing blood cells, for example, may be placed in each chamber and the cells centrifugally sedimented against the slide associated the respective chambers. A gasket 96 at the interface between each slide and its chamber prevents leakage of the sample and a conduit 102 in each chamber permits removal of the supernatant fluid following cell sedimenta tion.
