# Silver halide colour photographic light sensitive material.

## Abstract
A silver halide color photographic light sensitive mate rial is disclosed. The material is comprised of a support base having thereon a silver halide emulsion layer and two distinct types of couplers. One coupler is a diffusing dye forming coupler which can form a dye capable of having moderate diffusibility in an emulsion layer through coupling with an oxidation product of a color developing agent. The other coupler is a high reaction rate coupler which can form a dye of the same color as that of the diffusing dye forming coupler and that, has a coupling speed higher than that of the diffusing dye forming coupler by a factor of 1.3 to 15. By utilizing the two types of couplers in combination with each other the resulting material can provide images with im proved graininess over the entire density region of the dye image.
