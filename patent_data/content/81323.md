## Description
CURABLE INK OR PAINT CONTAINING ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE METAL PAK ICLES This invention relates to a curable ink or paint containing electrically conductive metal particles which render the cured ink or paint electrically conductive. The invention also relates to the electrically conductive cured ink or paint and to electrically conductive components and circuitry comprising the cured ink or paint. Curable inks or paints of this type are used in the manufacture of for example heating elements for vehicle windows, membrane switches, circuit components for use in for example potentiometers or electro optic displays or printed circuitry in general. The inks or paints comprise a high concentration 8X by volume of the ink or paint of electrically conductive metal particles dispersed in one or more organic prepolymers which are curable under the action of free radicals to produce a form stable electrically conductive cured ink or paint.The high concentration of metal particles is essential to ensure that even when well dispersed, the metal particles are sufficiently mutually adjacent preferably contiguous to render the cured ink or paint electrically conductive by providing conductive pathways through the cured ink or paint. Hitherto the ink or paint has usually comprised a thermally decomposable activator which on heating decomposes to generate free radicals so that the ink or paint can be cured by heating. In practice heating can only be done slowly and with careful control of temperature otherwise the organic prepolymers scorch. Attempts have been made to cure the ink or paint by means of ultra violet light which presents no serious risk of scorching and which in theory offers a faster cure.Rowever the minimum concentration of metal particles needed to ensure electrical conductivity is more than sufficient to screen all but the surface of the ink or paint from the curing action of the ultra violet light. An object of this invention is to provide a curable ink or paint comprising at least 8 by volume of metal particles which can be cured by means of ultra violet light to produce an electrically conductive cured ink or paint. Accordingly this invention provides a curable ink or paint comprising at least 8X preferably 10 to 26 by volume based on the volume of the uncured ink or paint of electrically conductive metal particles dispersed in one or more organic prepolymers which are curable by means of free radicals to produce an electrically conductive cured ink or paint wherein a the metal particles have a thickness of less than 1 sm, a maximum dimension of less than 30 and not more than 102 by number of the flakes have a maximum dimension of above 20 b the ink or paint also comprises a photosensitiser which is reversibly convertible to an excited state on irradiation by ultra violet light and c the ink or paint also comprises an activator which can be caused to create free radicals by the presence of the reversibly excited photosensitiser, whereby irradiation of the ink or paint with ultra violet light excites the photosensitiser causing the activator to create free radicals which cure the prepolymer. Preferably the metal particles are in t he form of flakes. Photosensitiser in the surface regions of the ink or paint receives energy from incident ultra violet light and it was discovered that provided the metal flakes were of suitably small dimensions, the received energy was transmitted around the flakes and into inner regions of the ink or paint so overcoming the screening problem posed by metal particles. It was discovered that free radical activity was generated throughout the ink or paint so that curing was not confined to the surface regions. Typical photosensitisers include amines or nitro or oxo compounds. Aromatic photoinitiators are preferred. Oxo compounds are less likely to discolour the ink or paint and usually have better dark stabilities especially when acrylate prepolymers are used. Good transmission of energy occurs if the oxo group is attached to an aromatic ring free from groups for example hydroxy groups ortho to the oxo group which stabilise an excited state.Suitable aromatic ketones include EMI5.1 EMI5.2 whereEMI5.3 Acetophenone or alternatively ie Benzophenone or Michier s ketone , dichloro p phenoxy acetophenoneEMI5.4 EMI5.5 where Z is R or C2H5 ie Xanthone or alternatively 9,10 anthraquinone or Thioxanthone, Ethyl 9,l0 anthraquinone Ethylthioxanthone, Dodecylthioxanthone, isopropylthioxanthone or 2 chlorothioxanthone may be used. EMI6.1 9,10 phenanthrenequinoneEMI6.2 4 methylbenzylthio phenyl ketoneEMI6.3 EMI6.4 Benzil Benzildimethyl acetalEMI6.5 Benzoin EMI7.1 where V isEMI7.2 ie 1 phenyl 1 , 2 propanedione 2 0 benzoylozime or V is OC2R5 ie 1 phenyl 1,2 propanedione 2 0 etboxycarbonyl oxime. Benzaldehyde is an example of an aldehyde photosensitiser and methyl ethyl ketone or diacetyl are typical of alphatic photosensitisers. Conventionally ultra violet light is regarded as having a wavelength of from 1 to 450 nm and for the purposes of this invention light having a wavelength of 200 to 450 nm is preferred so as to promote any diffraction around the metal particles which might occur. The activator is a compound which creates free radicals suitable for initiating curing on receipt of energy transmitted from the photosensitiser. Usually the activator will contain an easily abstracted mobile hydrogen moiety attached to a carbon moiety adjacent a moiety more electronegative than carbon for example nitrogen . Because the activator responds to broadly the same energy as the photosensitiser, the activater too is typically an amine, nitro or oxo compound, preferably aromatic. Accordingly photosensitisers which can develop mobile free radicals especially mobile hydrogen moieties may act as self photosensit sing activators provided that the rate of production of mobile free radicals is sufficiently slower than the rate of transmission of energy throughout the ink or paint.However it is not always easy to ensure that a self sensitising activator has a sufficiently slower rate of radical formation and so for this reason the activator may differ from the photosensitiser. The preferred activators are carboxylates and or gamines Typical preferred activators are aminophenyl carboxylates or alkylamino especially 3 dimethylamino benzoates, for exampleEMI8.1 where T is C2H5 or CH2CE20C4E9 ie Ethyl or Butoxyethyl 3 dimethylamino phenyl carboxylates. Other amine activators include 2,21 dihydroxydiethyl amine, dimethyl 2 hydroxyethyl amine, tri 2 hydroxyethyl amine, 3 dimethylamino benzaldehyde, 1,3 di N 2 hydroxyethyl 4piperidyl propane and 4 benzoyl pyradine. Non amines are chlorobenzophenone, 4, 41 bis trichloromethyl benzophenone, esters of 2 benzoyl benzoic acid, benzoyl biphenyl, 1 benzoyl napthalene, alpha i diethoxy acetophenone and 3 tertiary butyl , trichloro acetophenone. Examples of compounds which are both activators and sensitisers include Michler s ketone, 2 chlorothioxanthenone, 2 ethylanthra quinone and 2 chloroanthraquinone. The shelf life of the curable ink or paint may be increased by adding 2 radical stabiliser in order to inhibit the slow creation of free radicals which may occur even in the absence of ultra violet light. Suitable stabilisers may have a quinenoid structure such as beuzoquinone. The curable prepolymer comprises monomer, dimer, trimer, oligomer or a mixture of two or more of these types which cure to a macromolecule on initiation by free radicals. Mixtures comprising oligomers, trimers and or dimers are preferred because they are more easily obtained in forms sufficiently viscous for inks or paints. Viscosities of 50 to 200 centipoise are commonplace. Mixtures of two or more prepolymers will usually undergo copolymerisation including addition copolymerisation, intercondensation and or crosslinking during curing to form a macromolecule composed of moieties originating from more than one species of prepolymer. Suitable commercially available prepolymers include monomers, dimers, trimers and oligomers of vinyl acetate, vinyl alcohol and preferably esters of acrylic including methacrylic acids. For example alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkanepolyol esters of mono , di or triacrylates or their methacrylate analogues may be used. Specific examples include hydroxybutyl acrylate, dicyclopentadiene acrylate, 1,6 hexanediol monoacrylate, cyclohexylacrylate, 1,6 hexanediol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, trimethylol propane diacrylate, tritpropylene glycol diacrylate , trimethylol propane triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate and glycerol acrylates.Suitable higher molecular weight prepolymers include polyol acrylates, epoxy acrylates, polyester acrylates, polyether acrylates, melamine acrylates, urethan acrylates or acrylated alkylols and their methacrylate analogues. Specific examples include pentaerythritol tetracrylate, dipentaerythritol hexacrylate, ditrimethylol propane tetracrylate, epoxidised drying oil acrylate, aliphatic epoxy acrylates, oligoacrylates derived from bisphenols A or F and the condensates of a hydroxyl containing acrylate, a di isocyanate and a hydroxyl containing moiety. Aromatic prepolymers may be modified by isocyanates to produce prepolymers such as aromatic urethan acrylates.Examples of prepolymers which can only be used in mixtiires also comprising crosslinking prepolymers include polyamides which are usually crosslinked by means of amides such as N,N1 methylene or N,N1 hexamethylene bisacrylamide or bismethacrylamide. The propolymers may be used with coupling agents such as N vinyl pyrrolidone or trimethylol propane. The metal flakes are preferably made by flattening malleable metal spheres. The metal should possess good electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance and for this reason copper, aluminium, nickel, gold, platinum, palladium and especially silver are preferred. Alloys may be used. Prior to mixing with the prepolymer, the surface of the flake preferably carries a monomolecular layer of a surfactant such as the ester of a long ie C12 to C30 chain carboxylic acid. Oleates, stearates and palmitrates are convenient. The surfactant assists in the performance of this invention by facilitating the close approach of metal flakes so enabling a chosen degree of conductivity to be achieved with fewer flakes and hence a lower screening effect.Because of the electron tunnel effect, adjacent flakes need not be contiguous. For commercial purposes the resistivity of the layer of cured ink or paint should be less than one ohm per square portion of the surface of the layer. The flakes may be adequately dispersed in the prepolymer by means of three roll milling. The invention also provides a cured electrically conductive ink or paint comprising at least 8 by volume of metal flakes having the suitable dimensions as specified hereinbefore and containing a photoinitiator or its residues. The invention further provides a component for an electrical circuit or an electrical circuit each comprising the cured electrically conductive ink. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples. EXAMPLES 1 TO 4 Two types of silver flake were made.
