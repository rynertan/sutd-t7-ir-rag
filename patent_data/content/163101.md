# Method for surface treating copper foil.

## Abstract
A method is and its resulting product are disclosed relating to the surface treatment of copper stock such as copper foil to improve its bondability to nonmetallic sub strates. The method comprises immersing the copper in a bath having a composition consisting essentially of an aqueous solution of copper sulfate and sulfuric acid. While immersed in the bath, the copper is subjected to a plurality of pulsing treatment cycles, with each treatment cycle compris ing a first application of peak current of a magnitude and duration sufficient to form a first layer coating on the surface of the copper but insufficient to cause the formation of a nodular coating exhibiting treatment transfer and a second application of base current of a magnitude less than that of the peak current and sufficient to interrupt the formation of the first nodular layer but insufficient to serve to anchor the same to the foil surface. Preferably, the second application of current is longer than the first current application, with each treatment cycle milliseconds in duration, and all treatment cycles may be performed continuously. The resulting copper product is inexpensively prepared and exhibits uniformly superior bond strengths rendering it particularly well suited for printed circuit applications.
