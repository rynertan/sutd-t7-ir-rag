# VerticaL seismic profiling.

## Abstract
In vertical seismic profiling VSP , VSP seismic data is transformed into surface seismic data by mapping seg ments of the VSP seismic data into surface seismic data time. The transformation results in data which is more easi ly interpreted with respect to determining subsurface struc ture because the data is stacked and because the data is in a more conventional form.
