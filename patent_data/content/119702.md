# SYNTHETIC POLYPEPTIDES FROM VIRAL ONCOGENES

## Abstract
Synthetic polypeptides and their conjugates bound to a carrier are disclosed along with antibodies raised thereto, and methods of their use. The amino acid residue sequence of the synthetic polypeptides correspond substantially to an amino acid sequence of a determinant of an oncoprotein en coded by an oncogenic virus. That determinant domain is vicinal to but exclusive of an active site of the oncoprotein. The synthetic polypeptide or its conjugate is capable of in ducing the production of antibodies which can inhibit a reaction at an oncoprotein active site, immunoprecipitate the oncoprotein and react competitively with an admixture containing the synthetic polypeptide or its conjugate and another oncoprotein having a homologous determinant domain.
