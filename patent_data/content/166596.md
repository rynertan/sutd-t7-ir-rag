# Biodegradable amphipathic copolymers.

## Abstract
A pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable amphipath ic, non cross linked linear, branched or graft block copolymer, which has a minimum weight average molelcular weight of 1000, in which the hydrophobic component is biodegradable or hydrolytically unstable under normal physiological condi tions, and the hydrophilic component may or may not be biode gradable or hydrolytically unstable under such conditions, and which copolymer is self dispersible in water together with mixtures of such a copolymer and a drug, which may be water soluble or water insoluble, which mixtures are self dispersible in water and processes for the manufacture of such co polymers and such mixtures.
