# Method for forming a fast bipolar transistor for integrated circuit structure.

## Abstract
An improved bipolar device is disclosed having a poly silicon emitter 62 formed over a base region 70 of a silicon substrate with oxide spacer portions formed on the sides of the emitter, and metal silicide portions 90 formed over the base region adjacent the oxide spacers whereby the use of polysilicon for the emitter results in high gain as well as verti cal shrinking of the device because of the shallow diffusion of the emitter into the base and the elimination of an extrinsic base region. The use of oxide spacers and metal silicide adja cent the spacers results in a shrinkage of the horizontal spac ing of the device to lower the base emitter resistance and cap acitance to thereby increase the speed of the device.
