## Description
RADIATION CURABLE ALLYL BENZOYLBENZOATE COPOLYMERS, COMPOSITIONS AND PRODUCTS THEREOF, AND METHODS OF MAKING THEM This invention is concerned with certain radiationcurable allyl benzoylbenzoate copolymers, their use in the preparation of paper, non woven and textile products and adhesives, caulks and sealants and in coating and or impregnating compositions. The invention also embraces methods of preparing such products and compositions. Polymers of monoethylenically unsaturated vinyl monomers have many uses because of their outstanding physical properties and their adaptability to economical manufacture. However, they have disadvantages which tend to limit their usefulness, such as susceptibility to action Qf solvents, lack of resistance to gasoline, oil, and grease, excessive flexibility and lack of resilience, and loss of dimensional stability and strength at relatively low temperature. Various crosslinking techniques have been resorted to in trying to overcome the disadvantages mentioned that are associated with the conventional linear, two dimensional form. Such techniques have generally not been completely practical because they sometimes necessitate the use of harsh reaction conditions and often result in degradation of the polymer and serious susceptibility thereof to heat, particularly instability thereof to heat.The use of extraneous photosensitizers blended with the polymers is often accompanied by problems of compatibility, uniformity of distribution, volatility, toxicity or exudation and migration of the additive, often resulting in premature and or erratic crosslinking. It has been suggested in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,214,492, 3,429,852 and 3,574,617 to provide certain acetophenone or benzophenone derivatives having acryloxy or methacryloxy groups so that such compounds can be copolymerized with ethylene or with other vinyl monomers to provide copolymers that can be cured i.e crosslinked after shaping by exposure to radiation. In general, however, these monomeric compounds are relatively expensive to manufacture. U.S. Patent No. 2,461,301 discloses allyl o benzoylbenzoate, homopolymers thereof, and copolymers containing relatively large proportions, such as over 30 , thereof.However, there is no suggestion in the patent of copolymerizing a small amount of allyl benzoylbenzoate, from 0.1 to 10 by weight, with at least one other ethylenically unsaturated monomer to provide copolymers that are curable to a crosslinked condition upon exposure to radiation. U.S. Patents 3,926,640 and 3,926,641, disclose photopolymerizable compositions comprising the reaction product of l a hydroxy containing ester of an unsaturated acid and a polyol, such as ethylene glycol monomethacrylate or trimethylolpropane diacrylate with 2 a mono or di carboxyl benzophenone, such as benzoylbenzoic acid. Belgian Patent No. 866,657 discloses monoethylenically unsaturated derivatives of vinylbenzyl substituted benzophenones or acetophenones, and homopolymers and copolymers thereof that can be cured i.e. crosslinked by exposure to radiation. In accordance with the present invention, it has unexpectedly and surprisingly been discovered that copolymers containing small amounts, i.e. about 0.1 to 10 by weight, of allyl o , m , or p benzoylbenzoate or benzoyl ring substituted derivatives of allyl o , m , and p benzoylbenzoate, preferably allyl o benzoylbenzoate or benzoyl ring substituted derivatives thereof, e.g. with a wide variety of conventional ethylenically unsaturated vinyl or vinylidene monomers, can be readily cured i.e.crosslinked by exposure to radiation. Such copolymers per se or compositions containing them are particularly useful as adhesives, binders, coatings, caulks, foams, and impregnating compositions. According to the invention there is provided copolymer containing 1 from 0.1 to 10 by weight of units of at least one monomer of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R is H, C1 Cg alkyl, C1 r alkoxy, isobornyl C1 or Br, and 2 units of at least one different monoethylenically unsaturated monomer. Hereinafter, the expression allyl benzoylbenzoate monomers is used generically and is meant to include the various monomers represented by the formula above.Examples of suitable R substituent groups include alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, i propyl, n propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, 2 ethylhexyl, and isobornyl, and alkoxy groups such as methoxy, ethoxy, butoxy, and the like alkoxy derivatives of the alkyl groups mentioned above.As is set forth above, allyl o benzoylbenzoate and benzoylring substituted derivatives thereof are preferred. Such compounds may have the formula EMI3.2 wherein R is as defined above. When substituted, the allyl o p substituted benzoyl benzoate derivatives, wherein the para substituent is selected from the group consisting of alkyl and alkoxy, are preferred. More preferably, the allyl o benzoylbenzoate monomers which are useful in the present invention are those represented by the formula above wherein the group designated t R is H or C1 C4 alkyl, particularly H or a para substituent comprising at least one of CH3, C2H5, n C3H7, C3H77 OCH3, and C2H5 groups.Copolymers of allyl benzoylbenzoate monomers represented by the formula above can be prepared by any of the usual vinyl polymerization methods which are well known to those skilled in the art. Thus, such polymers may be prepared by means of free radical initiated processes utilizing bulk, suspension, solution, or emulsion polymerization techniques or they may be prepared by ionic catalysis or by means of stereospecific catalysts such as those of the type developed by Ziegler. The linear polymers may have molecular weights in the range of 10,000 to 300,000 viscosity average when made by solution technique, or fro 100,000 to 900,000 or more when made by emulsion technique. Chain transfer agents may be used to provide lower molecular weights. Preferably the amount of units of the above formulae in the copolymer is rom 0.1 to 5 by weight. The comonomers which many be utilized with allyl benzoylbenzoate monomers for the preparation of the crosslinkable copolymers of this invention can be any ethylenically unsaturated monomer such as, for example, styrene alpha methyl styrene vinyl toluene the acrylic and methacrylic acid esters of aliphatic alcohols, ebg. C1 C18 alkyl esters, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl, anyl, hexyl, 2 ethyl hexyl, octyl, isobornyl, lauryl and stearyl alcohols, more preferably C1 C8 alkyl esters acrylic acid methacrylic acid itaconic acid isoprene acrylamlde methacrylamide, acrylonitrile methacrylonitrile, butadiene vinyl propionate dibutyl fumarate dibutyl maleate diallyl phthalate vinylidene chloride vinyl chloride vinyl fluoride vinyl acetate ethylene and propylene etc. Any of these monomers may be used either alone or in combination with one another together with allyl benzoylbenzoate. Preferably, the comonomer s used are monoethylenically unsaturated monomers having a single group of the formula H2C C. Copolymers containing from about 0.1 to 10 , preferably from about 0.1 to 5 , by weight of allyl benzoylbenzoate monomers, can be effectively crosslinked upon exposure to actinic radiation, such as ultraviolet light. The copolymers of allyl benzoylbenzoate which are used in this invention, whether prepared by means of bulk, suspension, solution, or emulsion polymerization techniques or by other means, are all characterized by their sensitivity to ultraviolet light and thus are readily crosslinked by exposure thereto. This improved cross linking ability may be at least fully equivalent, and usually superior, to the results obtained when extraneous photosensitizers are added to comparable polymers which do not contain allyl benzoylbenzoate.Moreover, many of the deficiencies which are inherent in the use of these extraneous photosensitizers may be avoided with the products of this invention. Thus, these polymeric compositions generally exhibit excellent crosslinking ability without the difficulties posed by such problems as volatility, toxicity, migration and premature crosslinking. In addition to the preparation of conventional polymers which are prepared by the polymerization of at least one allyl benzoylbenzoate monomer together with one or more vinyl comonomers, it is also possible to prepare graft copolymers wherein at least one allyl benzoylbenzoate monomer is polymerized in the presence of previously prepared vinyl polymers such as polyolefins, polyvinyl halides and polyvinyl esters.The resulting graft copolymers also exhibit excellent crosslinking ability upon being exposed to actinic radiation, such as ultraviolet light In order to crosslink the copolymers of allyl benzoylbenzoate monomers it is merely necessary to expose them to ultraviolet light, i.e. to radiation having a wavelength of about 2xlO vm to 5xlO7m about 2,000 to 5,000 , for a period of time which is sufficient to accomplish the desired amount of crosslinking and yet which will not result in any undesirable degradation of the copolymer, said degradation being in the form of oxidation and chain cleavage of the copolymer and being manifested by discoloration and a marked deterioration in the physical properties of the copolymer composition.The length of exposure will also be dependent on the source of radiation as well as on the distance between the source and the copolymer sample. The crosslinking procedure may be conducted while the copolymer is still in the initial physical form resulting from the polymerization procedure. However, it is preferred and more convenient to effect the crosslinking reaction after the polymer has been formed into a shaped article, e.g. a film, coating, or molded article.In either instance, the degree of crosslinking will be determined by the extent to which the copolymer has been insolubilize. Thus, for example, if the copolymer is still in solution, crosslinking will be evidenced by the procresslve precipitation or gelation of the dissolved copo1e. On the other hand, if the copolymer has been formed into a shaped article, crosslinking will be noted by the resistance exhibited by the shaped article to solvents in which it would ordinarily dissolve or soften. The resulting crosslinked compositions can then be used for a wide variety of applications. Thus, they may be used in applications wherein high oil, grease and solvent resistance as well as increased stiffness are required. Specifically, they may be used in photoreproduction processes, in processes wherein it is desirable to engrave or carve intricate shapes and or designs without the use of cutting tools, and in industrial construction. The addition copolymers of allyl benzoylbenzoate monomers that are of linear, essentially uncrosslinked character retain their formability by virtue of their thermoplastic and soluble nature, so that they can readily be shaped into films, sheets, and other articles and then can be exposed to active radiation, such as ultraviolet light of wave length mentioned hereinabove, to crosslink the polymers and thereby render them infusible and insoluble. For example, the uncrosslinked copolymers may be used as film forming binders, adhesives or topcoats in the production of various coating and or impregnating compositions, such as pigment dyeing and printing compositions for application to papers, textiles and films which after application can be rendered resistant to removal by heating or solvents by subjecting the films carried by or in the textiles or papers to actinic radiation.Examples of products to which such topcoats may be applied include vinyl coated fabrics and wall coverings. Examples of films which can be coated by the copolymers of the invention are any one of the variety of well known plasticized polyvinyl chloride films. The linear addition copolymers can be used as binders for non woven fabrics or webs. They may be applied uniformly over the entire area of the non woven web or in any predetermined pattern, e.g. along intersecting sets of parallel lines, either straight or curved in a regular or even somewhat irregular array. Depending on the purpose for which the product is to be used, the fibrous product of non woven character may contain from about 1 400 , e.g. 2 400 , by weight of copolymer binder based on the dry weight of the untreated web.In uses where the product is intended to retain some fibrous quality, the preferred proportion of binder is from about 10 150 by weight. The impregnated nonwoven web may then be subjected to actinic radiation, e.g. UV light, to crosslink the polymer wherever it is present, thereby rendering the treated non woven web more or less resistant to disintegration by water or solvents.Instead of applying the linear polymer of the present invention in a pattern to the non woven web, it may be applied uniformly throughout the area of the web and then the web may be subjected to the actinic radiation, e.g.ultraviolet light, in a predetermined pattern through a light filter or opaque screen so that selected areas of the polymer film coating or impregnant are protected from the actinic radiation whereas other areas are exposed and rendered more or less resistant to solvents and or water.After the screened exposure, the unexposed portions of the polymer may be removed by washing, as by an aqueous or organic solvent. The copolymers of allyl benzoylbenzoate monomers may be used to produce wet wipes , disposable diapers and or diaper covercloths. The use of a screen or filter can control the extent of crosslinking selectively in various areas of the bonded diaper or diaper covercloth so that, for example, the crotch area can be rendered resistant to disintegration by water soaking whereas the peripheral areas can be disintegrated within a short time of half a minute to two minutes or so on soaking in water. The crotch area may be of sufficiently small size that it will not interfere with the flushing of the entire diaper and or diaper covercloth down the toilet after use. The copolymers of allyl benzoylbenzoate monomers may be used to produce caulk compositions. These compositions possess the highly desirable properties of remaining flexible and extensible while the surface develops a paint like tack free film upon exposure to UV radiation. The copolymers of allyl benzoylbenzoate monomers may be used to produce foam compositions useful, for example, in producing foam backed films which in turn are useful, for example, in lumber wrap applications. When used in this way, the above described foam compositions possess the advantageous property, upon exposure to UV radiation, of providing a foam backed film characterized by a reduced tendency to block i.e. stick to itself on being rolled up. One embodiment of the invention provides a film of the copolymer of the invention either substantially uncrosslinked or at least partially crosslinked. The film may be a coating and or impregnation, for example a film of essentially uncrosslinked addition polymer comprising from 0.1 to 10 by weight of allyl benzoylbenzoate monomer of formula I wherein the film is carried on or in a substrate adapted to be cured to a crosslinked condition on exposure to ultraviolet radiation.A solvent resistant protective film of the copolymer may be prepared on a substrate by applying to the substrate a composition comprising a solution or dispersion of essentially uncrosslinked addition polymer of the invention, at least partially drying the composition or allowing it to at least partially dry to form a film and, subsequently, and or concurrently with the drying step, subjecting the film to actinic radiation to at least partially crosslink the polymer. The invention also embraces methods of preparing certain products in which certain materials are coated and or impregnated with the copolymer which is cured by exposure to actinic radiation, such as ultraviolet radiation. Preferred materials are non woven fabrics, paper and textiles. Alternatively the polymers may be formulated to form compositions useful as caulks, sealants, adhesives and other coating compositions. Accordingly the invention also provides a non woven fibrous web bonded by the impregnation thereof with linear, essentially uncrosslinked addition copolymer of the invention wherein the copolymer is used in a proportion of from about 1 to 400 by weight based on the dry weight of the untreated web. Also provided is a nonwoven fibrous web wherein the copolymer binder is cured to a crosslinked condition by controlled exposure of the impregnated web to ultraviolet light, thereby rendering the bonded web resistant to disintegration in aqueous media or in organic solvent media to a limited extent.The non woven fibrous web may be inihe form of a diaper covercloth wherein various areas have been subjected to different extents of ultraviolet exposure, a crotch area being thereby more resistant to disintegration on soaking in water than the peripheral areas, thereby providing a diaper disposable by flushing down a toilet. A method of producing such a disposable diaper cloth comprises impregnating a web of adsorbent fibers with a dispersion of linear, essentially uncrosslinked addition copolymer of the invention, squeezing the impregnated web to provide an add on, dry, of about 1 to 20 by weight Or the copolymer, based on the dry fiber weight of the web, drying the impregnated web and subjecting the web containing the polymer to UV light while using a mask having an opening at the crotch area to provide greater curing of the polymer in that area Preferab the method of making a non woven fabric comprises a. providing a mass of fibers associated in a random or a regular pattern to form a web or mat b. contacting with the fibers, thereby impregnating the fibers with an aqueous dispersion of a binder comprising an emulsion polymer, containing from about 1 to 60 by weight of resin solids, polymerized from a monomer mixture comprising about 0.1 to 10 by weight of an allyl benzoylbenzoate monomer of formula I above c. drying the binder impregnated mass of fibers, to effect fusion of the polymer and bonding of the fibers thereby and d. exposing the dried binder impregnated mass of fibers to ultraviolet radiation for a period of time sufficient to cure the binder. Another embodiment comprises a cellulosic fiber paper having improved wet strength impregnated with at least about 1 by weight, based on the dry fiber weight, of a linear, essentially uncrosslinked addition copolymer of the invention, the copolymer being in crosslinked state resulting from exposure of the impregnated paper to ultraviolet light.

The three polymer dispersions are diluted to 3 solids concentration. Separate sheets of the paper are placed between glass fiber screens to support the paper as it is passed through a respective one of the 3 solids polymer dispersions and then through the squeeze rolls of a textile padder adjusted to provide a dry add on after drying the treated paper at 600C. for 15 minutes of 4 to 6 . Half of each treated paper after drying at 600C. for 15 minutes is passed twice one pass for each side on a conveyor belt through an ultraviolet curing range consisting of two 80 W cm mercury vapor lamps in a housing through which the paper is conveyed at a speed of 4.5 m sec. Strips of treated paper are soaked in water for 30 minutes and tensile tested in the cross machine direction using th e cut strip method described in ASTM D1117 69 7.6 cm gage length, 30.5 cm min . Results are tabulated below. Although UV exposure increased strength in the absence of photomonomer Copolymer A due to degradative crosslinking of EA, significantly higher cured strengths and higher ratios of cured to uncured strengths are attained with photomonomer present Copolymers B and C .

On disposal in a toilet the bulk of such a diaper cover disintegrates, and the crotch area is small enough to pass through the sanitary plumbing system without clogging it. A flushable diaper covercloth is made with an air laid web weighing 60 g m2 and composed of 25 1.5 denier, 4 cm rayon fiber and 75 wood fiber. The wood fiber is of the tl pe used in the absorbent padding under the covercloth in conventional disposable diapers The web is placed between glass fiber screens, passed through a bath containing 5 of the solids of the emulsion polymer obtained in Examples 4 and 5 and then through the squeeze rolls of a textile padder. The web thus treated is removed from the screens and dried in an oven for 3 minutes at 1150C. The resulting composition of the covercloth is 85 fiber and 15 polymer binder. The bonded web is cut to diaper size, 31 cm by 43 cm, and placed under a cardboard mask.In the center of the mask there is a hole measuring 15 cm by 23 cm with the longer dimension oriented in the longer direction of the covercloth. The mask and covercloth are passed through an ultraviolet curing range to irradiate the center portion of the diaper cover. The cover is then turned over to similarly irradiate the other side. The UV curing range consists of two 8C cm mercury vapor lamps and a conveyor belt in a suitable housing.The nonwoven diaper covercloth is run under the lamps at a speed of 4.5 m sec. The tensile strength of the cured portion of the web is 400 g cm of with measured in a soaking wet condition. The uncured portion is moistened to a 60 water content and found to have a tensile strength of 3 g cm of width. An entire diaper covercloth treated as above is gently agitated in a bucket full of cold water. The uncured portion of the cloth disintegrates in 1 to 2 minutes leaving the small cured portion intactEXAMPLE 10.
