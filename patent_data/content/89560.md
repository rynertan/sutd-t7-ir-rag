# Process for the production of optical fiber preforms.

## Abstract
An improved process for the production of optical fiber porous preforms 4 of predetermined refractive index distribution by the vapor phase deposition method is dis closed wherein a glass material and a dopant material are subjected to flame oxidation by the use of an oxyhdrogen burner 2 to form fine glass particles which are deposited on one end of a supporting rod 3 adapted to move apart from the oxyhydrogen burner 2 while rotating to allow a rod like porous preform 4 to grow thereon. The improved process is characterized in that the correlation between the shape of the deposition face and the refractive index distribution is previously determined mathematically, and on a basis of the correlation therebetween, a process variable such as the distance between the porous preform 4 and the burner 2 is adjusted to produce the desired shape of the deposition face 7 whereby there can be obtained an optimum refrac tive index distribution.
