# Process of preparing homogeneous resin polyiodide disinfectants.

## Abstract
Demand type disinfectants are prepared from strong base anion exchange resin beads and elemental iodine. The resin is in the iodide form, and the iodine is applied with a water carrier which is recycled in contact with the resin and the stoichiometric amount of iodine to form the desired polyiodide viz. I₃ , I₅ , or mixtures thereof . A homogeneous product of pre determined poiyiodide content is obtained
