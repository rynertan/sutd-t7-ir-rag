## Description
TITLE ACRYLIC POLYMER COATED GRANULAR PESTICIDAL COMPOSITIONS It is known that a number of phosphorus pesticidal compounds, such as 2 diethoxyphosphinyl imino 1, 3 dithiolane, 2 diethoxyphosphinylimino 4 methyl 1,3 dithiolane, 2 diethoxyphosphinylimino 1,3 dithietane, O,O diethyl S ethylthiomethyl phosphorodithioate and O,O diethyl S tt l,l dimethylethyl thiogmethyl phosphorodithioate, are highly effective for the control of broad spectrum of insects and or nematodes which attack and destroy agriculturally important food and fodder crops. It is, therefore, of advantage to utilize such compounds in various compositions useful in agriculture.Unfortunately, these otherwise highly effective pesticides are extremely toxic when introduced into the human circulatory system as by ingestion, inhalation, or dermal absorption. Thus, the use of compositions containing the above referred to compounds for the control of insect pests represents a distinct hazard to individuals engaged in the use and application thereof. Similar hazards are encountered by those who are engaged in storing, transporting and distributing to the ultimate user such compositions. Practical use aspects of the above referred 0 pesticide compounds for intended pest control often dictate the use of various granular carrier compositions in which the pesticidal compound is adsorbed or absorbed onto or into the carrier composition. These granular compositions not only provide a more dilute composition of tWhe active pesticide for appropriate applications in agronomic uses but also serve to reduce the potential hazard in use of the pesticide through dermal absorption. Even though such formulated compositions tend to reduce the potential hazard of dermal absorption of the above referred to pesticides, it is highly desirable to reduce the potential hazard even more. It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a granular formulation composition containing a phosphorus pesticide which exhibits reduced mammalian dermal toxicity, while retaining its presticidal effectiveness. To these ends, it has been found that, when solid granular compositions containing phosphorus pesticides are treated, as by spraying for instance, with certain acrylic latices, or with solutions of certain acrylic polymers in organic solvents, the resultant acrylic polymer coated compositions possess advantageously a two to three fold margin of safety due to their lowered mammalian dermal toxicity as compared to similar, uncoated compositions, while their pesticidal activity and physical integrity remains unchanged. These effects may be accomplished in a straightforward manner by applying certain acrylic latex compositions or solutions of certain polymers in an organic solvent to the surfaces of said impregnated pesticidal granules. More specifically, the invention in one aspect is a solid particulate composition comprising particles of an inert sorptive or non sorptive carrier impregnated or coated with a phosphorus pesticide, and optionally cuat and blended with a finely divided sorptive substrate, characterized in that the carrier pesticide entity is coated with an acrylic polymer selected from the group consisting of a 1 hard, thermoplastic acrylic polymer having an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.75 dl g to 3.1 dl g at 300C. in tetrahydrofuran, 2 hard, self crosslinking thermoplastic acrylic polymers having an intrinsic viscosity of from 1.0 dl g to 2.0 dl g at 30or. in dimethylformamide and 3 acrylic polymers having an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.05 dl g to 0.1 dl g at 30 C. in butanol. The invention also provides a method for controlling the rate of toxicant release of a toxicant containing particulate composition comprising applying to said composition, in amounts ranging from, 0.5 to 5 , by weight, of the total composition, an acrylic polymer selected from the group consisting of 1 hard thermoplastic acrylic polymers having an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.75 dl g to 3.0 dl g at 0 30 C. in tetrahydrofuran, 2 hard self crosslinking thermoplastic acrylic polymers having an intrinsic viscosity of from 1.0 dl g to 2.0 dl g at 30 C. in dimethylformamide, and 3 acrylic polymers having an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.05 dl g to 0.1 dl g at 300C. in butanol wherein said solid particulate composition comprises particles of an inert, coarse or funely divided, sorptive or non sorptive carrier impregnated or coated with said toxicant. According to the process of the invention, in preferred embodiments, the compositions of the granular formulation, prior to acrylic polymer coating, are yepaxd by impregnating a toxicant ranging from about 2 to about 25 , by weight, and , preferably, from 2.5 to 20 , by weight, said toxicant being 2 diethoxy phosphinylimino l, 3 dithiolane, 2 diethoxyphosphinyl imino 4 methyl l, 3 dithiolane 2 diethoxyphosphinyl imino l, 3 dithietane, 0,O diethyl S ethylthiomethyl phosphorodithioate, 0, O diethyl S t l,l dimethyl ethyl thiomethyljphosphorodithioate, and equivalents thereof, with a suitable granular carrier.Illustrative of the latter carrier is either a a sorptive material, such as attapulgite or montmorillonite clays , brick chips, pumice, talc, volcanic cinders, corncob grits, or b a non sorptive material, such as sand or limestone chips. If a sorptive material is selected, a deactivator such as ethylene glycol, di , tri or tetraethylene glycol and mixtures thereof can be added to neutralize intrinsic acidity in amounts ranging from about 3 to about 6 , by weight, of said compositions. In this event, the amount of granular carrier is decreased by an amount equal to that of the deactivator added to said composition.Advantageously, the above described granular composition may be blended and or coated with from about 0.5 , by weight, to about 2 , by weight of composition of a finely divided sorptive substrate, such as calcined powdered clays, diatomaceous earth, calcium silicate, fumed silica, and fumed silica which has been made hydrophobic by the replacement of most of the hydrophilic hydroxyl group, which normally populate the silica surface, with trimethylsiloxyl groups as well as mixtures of said substrate. It has been found that the addition of said sorptive substrate to the granular formulations aids in maintaining the free flow form ation of agglomerates in same, particularly subsequent to treatment with a sprayed acrylic polymer, defined hereinbelow with particularity. It is a good practice to coat impregnated granular formulations, hereinabove set forth, by any suitable means, such as by spraying with an acrylic latex. The coating is accomplished by spraying either an aqueous emulsion of an acrylic polymer or a solution of an appropriate acrylic polymer in amounts sufficient to provide an acrylic polymer coating of from about 0.5 to about 5 , by weight, and more preferably, from about 1.5 to about 4 , by weight, of the overall granular formulation.Examplary of the above mentioned acrylic latices are a thermoplastic acrylic emulsion polymers with a solids content of from about 38 to about 43 by weight, and having an intrinsic viscosity range of from 0.75 to 3.1 dl g at 300C. in THF tetrahydrofuran , b crosslinking acrylic emulsion polymers with a solids content of about 45 46 , by weight, and having an intrinsic viscosity range of from 1.0 to 2.0 and, preferably, about 1.4 dl g at 300C. in DMP dimethyl formamide , and c solutions of acrylic polymers in tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, wherein said acrylic polymers have an intrinsic viscosity range of from aboutO.05 to 0.1 dl g and, preferably, about .085 dl g at 300C. in butanol. It is an advantage in carrying out the process of the invention to prepare the coated granular compositions in a straightforward manner involving a plurality of steps. For instance, from about 2 to about 30 by weight, and preferably from about 2.5 to about 20 by weight, of formulation of a toxicant selected from the above identified group, for instance, O,O diethyl S t lsl dimethylethyl thiogmethyl phosphorodithioate, is mixed with from about 3 to about 6 , by weight, of formulation of a deactivator selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, di , tri or tetraethylene glycol and mixtures thereof.The weight percent of the overall mixture is based on the weight of the carrier. This mixture is then sprayed on a granular carrier selected from the group consisting of clays, such as attapulgite and montmorillonite clays, brick chips, pumice, talc, volcanic cinders, corncob grits, sand and limestone chips, wherein said carrier is used in amounts from about 62 , by weight, to about 94 and, preferably from about 68 to about 92 , by weight of formulation. After the spraying has been completed, agitation of the mixture is continued until all of the liquid is absorbed. Thereafter, if so desired, from about 0.5 to about 2 , by weight, of a finely divided sorptive substrate is added and agitation of the mixture continued until a uniform blend is obtained.The latter sorptive substrate is illustratively calcined powdered clays, diatomaceous earth, calcium silicate, fumed silica and fumed silica which has been made hydrophobic as by the replacement of most of the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups which normally populate the silica surface with trimethyl sSlcxyl groups. The formulations so prepared are then agitated by suitable means and sprayed with either one of a group of certain acrylic latices an aqueous emulsion of an acrylic polymer or a solution of said acrylic polymer is a solvent, such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, in amounts sufficient to provide an acrylic polymer coating of, preferably, from about 0.5 to about 5 , by weight, and, more preferably, from about 1,5 to about 4 by weight, of said granular formulations.The latter latices may be selected from hard thermoplastic acrylic emulsion polymers with a solids content ranging from about 38 to about 43 by weight, and having an intrinsic viscositysange of f m 0.75 to 3.1 dl g at 300C.in TEF tetrahydrofuran , from hard self crosslinking acrylic emulsion polymers with a solids content of about 45 46 by weight, and having an intrinsic viscosity range of from 1.0 to 2.0 and, preferably, about 1.4 dl g at 30 C. in dimethylformamide DMF , and from solutions of acrylic polymers in tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, wherein said acrylic polymers have an intrinsic viscosity range of form 0.05 to 0.1 dl g, and preferably, 0.085 dl g at 30 C. in butanol. If desired, the above formulations may be heated to accelerate and increase the hardening of said coatings. It is found that, by utilizing the teaching of the present invention, a number of compositions can be prepared within which it is possible to select one wherein the toxicant is released rapidly into the surrounding environment over a relatively short period of time or to alteruatively select a composition which will release said toxicant slowly over a prolonged period of time. Thus, it is possible to adjust, within certain practical limits, if so desired, the controlled release of toxicant from the novel compositions of the present invention by the selection of suitable formulations. The coated granular pesticidal compositions also exhibit reduced mammalian dermal toxicity.

Saran tubing or Winylite film W1900, 30.5 cm 12 wide, 0.04 millimeter in thickness and long enough to fit around the rabbit. c. One felt cloth bandage measuring approximately 22.9 x 45.7 cm 9 x 18 . d. Four pieces of 3.8 cm 1.5 adhesive tape approximately 35.6 cm 14 long.Procedure a. The granular material is placed in the center of the plastic film and is moistened with water. b. The rabbits underside is moistened with water and the animals are placed belly down on the material. c. The plastic is then brought up and around the animal and secured at each end with strips of adhesive tape. The felt cloth is then placed under the belly and brought up around the animal and secured to the body with the remaining two strips of adhesive tape.Evaluation Twenty four hours after dosing, the cuff is removed and any remaining material is brushed away.

Tow l ounce 29.7 ml jars of soil are removed for 0 days mortality evaluation with southern corn rootworm Diabrotica undecipunctata howardi larvae. The remainder of the treated soil is divided between 2 wide mouth pint 475 ml treated paper containers. Each container of soil received 100 ml of tap water, bringing the soil to near field moisture holding capacity. A regime of moistening and drying continues throughout the test period. The treated soils plus the untreated control are held in the holding room at about 26.7 C. At weekly intervals the duplicate containers of soil are removed, the soil thoroughly mixed, moistened to about 25 moisture holding capacity, and two l ounce 29.7 ml jars of soil are removed for bioassay with southern corn rootworm larvae. The data obtained are summarized in Table II below.
