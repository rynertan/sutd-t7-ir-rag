# TREATMENT OF FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND MEAT PRODUCTS

## Abstract
Fruit, vegetable and meat products and their derivatives are exposed in liquid and or gaseous form to a polyether based polymer to extract ingredients therefrom. The products and derivatives may be for human consumption or may be in the effluent of a food processing plant. A preferred embodiment is the treatment of grape juice and wine derived from labruscan grapes to extract unwanted colour and flavour components.
