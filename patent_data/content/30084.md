# Method for preparing phenylalkanes.

## Abstract
A process for the selective alkylation of aromatic compounds with an alkylating agent comprising an aliphatic or aromatic organic compound having at least one available reactive alkyl group of at least a 5 carbon atom hydrocarbon chain to produce phenylalkanes having an improved yield of the more external phenyl isomers. The reaction is carried out in the presence of crystalline zeolite catalysts, such as ZSM 4, ZSM 20, ZSM 38, mazzite, Linde Type L and zeolite Beta.
