# IMPROVED P I N AND AVALANCHE PHOTODIODES

## Abstract
High speed p i n and avalanche photodetectors photo diodes use a heavily doped buried layer 14 to greatly limit minority carriers generated by incident light in the buried layer 16 and the substrate 12 of the device from reaching the cathode 18 and thus enhances device response time while substantially decreasing dark current. A p i n diode of this type with a 1.1 square millimeter active area can operate with an unusually small e.g. 5 volt reverse bias and is capable of having edge rise and fall times in the 4 nanose cond range.
