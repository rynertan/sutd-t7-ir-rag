# Apparatus for feeding cartons from a stack.

## Abstract
A high speed feeder for cartons being fed into a cartoner includes both mechanical and fluid flow environments for precisely delivering cartons. A preferably inclined conveyor 12 receives cartons 14 stacked on their edges and in a generally vertically orientation. Separating means, suitably in the form of a rotating metering wheel 60 are provided at the downstream end of the conveyor to engage the top edges of the cartons and separate them one at a time from the incoming stack 13, 42 . Holding means, preferably in the form of a pressure roller 45 , are provided adjacent and upstream of the separating means 60 to hold back most of the upstream cartons see 13 while permitting only a few cartons 42 to pass.
