# Plastics strap and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A polypropylene strap for use in packaging articles is manufactured by stretching a belt like sheet 3 of poly propylene which has been extruded from a die, in the length wise direction thereof at a relatively high draw ratio for example, 4 9, heating the surfaces of the resulting sheet to put the molecular chains in the superficial layers 21 only thereof in a non oriented state, and then stretching the sheet 3 at a relatively low draw ratio of, for example, 1 .2 3. Such a poly propylene strap has a high tensile strength, a low elongation, a high rigidity, a high abrasion resistance, and flexible surfaces, and it is not easily split in the longitudinal direction.
