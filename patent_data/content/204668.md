## Description
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to an improved process of purifying crude trifluralin containing trace amounts of nitrosa ,ines, in order to reduce the level thereof to a value below at least 0.5 ppm. Trifluralin is the commercial name for 4 tri fluoromethyl 2,6 dinitro N,N di n propylaniline, which is widely used in agriculture as a herbicide. Following the development of highly sensitive methods of analysis, e.g. those using mass spectrography of eluates of chromatographic separation GC MS , it was verified that some unrefined trifluralin contained nitrosamines in small quantities, typically from a few ppm to a few hundred ppm. The origin of nitrosamines in trifluralin can derive from the final stage of the conventional preparation process which consists of a reaction between di n propylamine and 4 trifluoromethyl 2,6 dinitro chlo ro benzene according to the equation I EMI1.1 The compound 4 tri fluorome thyl 2, 6 di ni tro chloro ben zene may some nitrosating agents which react with the amine to form the nitrosamine. The presence of nitrosamines in trifluralin, even in quantities of a few ppm is considered undesirable due to the discovery of carcinogenic properties of sonde nitrosamines in animals. In order to prepare a refined trifluralin, with a nitrosamine content lower than 0.5 ppm, which at present is the level commercially desirable, several processes have been developed either by preventing the formation of nitrosamines by previously treating the dinitro derivative to remove therefrom the nitrosating agents which could give rise to the formation of nitrosamines, or by removing the nitrosamines from trifluralin. Among the processes for the elimination of. the nitrosating agents from the dinitro derivative used as an intermediate in the preparation of trifluralin, are those disclosed by U.S. Patent Nos. 4,120,905 and 4,338,473, which are based on the treatment of said intermediate with an aqueous solution of alkaline substances and the simultaneous bubbling through said solution of an inert gas or, simply, with water, which is at least partially removed by distillation. These processes cannot however guarantee the complete removal of the nitrosating agents, ts , since no analytical methods for these exist so that the certainty of their removal can only be verified after the preparation of the final trifluralin product and analysis of its nitrosamine content. ln order to remove the nitrosamines from the final product it was disclosed to treat trifluralin with a concentrated aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid or with gaseous hydrochloric acid U.S. Patent 4,226,7B9 or with inorganic acid chlorides U.S. Patent 4 185,035 or with chlorine or bromine U.S. Patent 4,127,610 . Although all these processes have been proven to be effective to cause the destr uction of the nitrosamines, they are not free from drawbacks mainly due to the long reaction time required to reduce the nitrosamine content to a level below at least 0.5 ppm. Furthermore, it was found that the treatment of trifluralin with hydrochloric acid causes the formation of di n propylaw,ine and 4 trifluoromethyl 2,6 dinitro chloro benzene, due to the reversal Of the above mentioned reaction I , whereby the hydrochloric aqueous phase and likely also the organic phase are contaminated with amines. This originates a twofold drawback. On the one hand, in order to allow the optional recycle of the hydrochloric acid solution, the latter must be thoroughly purified, on the other hand, even the trace amount of amines contained in the trifluralin phase may by reaction with nitrogen oxides which are present in the atmosphere cause the formation of nitrosamines during the further processing of trifluralin to obtain herbi cidal compositions. it is also to be noted that in order to achieve a sufficiently fast reaction rate. the hydrochloric acid solution is generally used with a concentration higher than 20 wt, typically 35 wt, so that the required dis tillation of the used solution leads to obtain an azeotropic mixture with a 20 wt IIC1 concentration, which can hardly be re used. It 1s also known that the destruction of the nitrosamines contained in the trifluralin may be carried out by treatment with an aqueous hydrobromic acid solution, as disclosed e.g. by R.F. Eizemberg et Al., Journal of Organic Chemistry vol. 44 1979 , pages 784 786, however the use of hydrobromic acid never found industrial application up to now. In fact, in spite of the fact that the rate at which the nitrosamines are destroyed by the hydrobromic acid is much higher than that with hydrochloric acid when one uses an aqueous solution of acid that has not been used before for the same purpose, it diminishes rapidly when the same solution is re used.A reduction in the destructive activity is furthermore observed1 so much so that after only a few recyclings of the solution, the content of nitrosamines cannot be reduced below levels of 1 ppm, no matter how long the time or hoo high the temperature of the treatment are. There is a kind of poisoning of the aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid which makes its further use practically impossible. Furthermore, strong difficulties have been encountered to transfer from the laboratory scale, wherein the treatment with hydrobromic acid is effected with hydrobromic acid of analytical grade, to the industrial scale wherein it is necessary to use hydrobromic acid of technical grade. In fact, while the reaction leading to the destruction of the nitrosamines proceeds rapidly with freshly prepared hydrobromic acid of analytical grade, the same reaction occurs with dif ficulty with hydrobromic acid of technical grade, likely because of the prcsence in it of not well identified im purifies which hinder the kinetics. Jn lacy, in the patent li terature, processes wlilch make use of hydrochloric acid alone have been disclosed, while the use of hydrobromic acid is recited exclusively in combination with other substances, e.g. aldehydes and ketones such as mentioned in U.S. Patent 4,134,917. It has flow been found, and this constitutes the basis of the present invention, that it is possible to completely eliminate the poisoning of the aqueous hydrobromic acid solutions which are used in the treatment of crude trifluralin containing nitrosamines and to use in this treatment hydrobrotmic acid of technical grade if small quantities of sulphamic acid and of alkaline metal bisulphite are added to the hydrobromic acid solution. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide an irr.proved process of purifying crude trifluralin containing nitrosamines to reduce the level thereof to a value below at least 0.5 ppm, comprising mixing the trifluralin under agitation with an aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid, characterised in that it further comprises the step of adding to said aqueous hydrobromic acid solution en amount of sulphamic acid of from 0.1 to 3 g per liter of said aqueous solution and an amount of alkaline metal bisulphite corresponding to a content of SO2 from 0.3 to 1,2 g per liter of said aqueous solution. The process according to the present invention makes the use of aqueuus hydrobromic acid solutions industrially convenient with respect to the conventonal processes, since it is possible to use solutions of technical grade and furtheremore it allows several recyclings of the solution, apart front the need ol making up the quantity of hydrobromic acid which reacts with the nitrosamines present in the unrefined tri flural in. The mechanism of action of sulphamic acid on the aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid is not verify clear, but it is thought that it destroys nitrosylic type compounds which form during the treatment of the unrefined trifluralin and which are able to regenerate the nitrosamines by reaction with the trifluralin. As to the mechanism of action of the a5Ra ine metal bisul phite, it is thought that sulphur dioxide deriving therefrom act t as a reducing agent to cause the chemical reduction of nitro compounds to nitroso compounds which in turn may be destroyed by the action of hydrobronic acid and sulphamic acid. Typically the treatment with the aqueous hydrobromic acid solution is carried out at a temperature from 20 to 900C, preferably between 60 and 9oçC. The reaction time typically ranges from 10 minutes to 4 hours, a reaction time of about 30 minutes being sufficient to achieve a reduction of the nitrosamin level to below 0.5 ppm when the reaction is carried out at 800C. The concentration of hydrobromic acid in the aqueous solution used for the process according to the invention is not particularly critical relative to the destruction of the nitrosamines it is however necessary to avoid having aqueous solutions with the same density as that of the molten trifluralin to avoid uselDss con,plications in the separation of the trif3uralin front the acid aqueous solution at the end of the treatment.Typically it is used an aqueous solution having a concentration of hydrobromic acid between 15 and 50 by weight, preferably between 23t, and 27 by weight. The latter concentration range is preferred as to the more favourable kinetics, the greater ease of separation between the aqueous and the trifluralin phase at the end of the treatment and as to the possibility of further recycling of the solution when it has been used for several recyclings and needs be regenerated by distillation. In fact, the distillation of an aqueous solution having a concentration of hydrobromic acid within the above mentioned preferred range leads to obtain an azeotropic mixture having a concentration of hydrobromic acid of AB wt which may be easily re used in the process by being diluted to 25 wt and by addition of fresh hydrobromic acid. The ratio of the aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid and the trifluralin to be treated is not particularly critical and is typically between 0.2 and 0.8 liters of aqueous acid sqlution of per kilogram of trifluralin. Greater volumes of solution show no improvement in the results1 while an excessively low value of said ratio makes contact more difficult between the two liquid phases during the treatment. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, ratios between the acidic aqueous solution and the trifluralin of fre 0.3 to G.5 liters kilogram are used. Typically, the amount of sulphamic acid is from 0.1 to 3 g liter of acidic solution, preferably from 0.4 to 0.7 glliter. Smaller quantities of sulphamic acid are insufficient to purify the aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid, while greater quantities show no advantage but increase the cost of the treatment. As it is known, sulphamic acid is very soluble in water, it is therefore possible to add the desired amount of sulphamic acid directly to the aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid obtaining almost immediate dissolving. Preferably, aqueous solutions of sulphamic acid with concentrations from 10 to 20 wt are used, since they are more manageable and allow a simpler dosage of the small quantity which has to be used. The reaction rate of sulphamic acid with the impurities which poison the aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid is very fast and it may be considered as terminated by the end of the addition of the sulphamic acid. As alkaline metal bisulphite, it is preferably used sodiun bisulphite in a quantity corresponding to a content of sulphur dioxide from 0.3 to 1.2 g liter of aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid, preferably from 0.5 to 0.8 g liter of said solution. Sodium bisulphite may be used in the forms commercially available, such as anhydrous sodium bisulphite having a content of SO of about 60 by weight or a solution of sodium bisulphite with a content of S02 from 24 to 26 by weight or sodium metabisulphite having a content of SO2 of about 65 by weight. According to the process for the removal ol the nitrosamines, the crude trifluralin is mixed under strong agitation with the aqueous solution of dro bromic acid which has been added with sulphamic acid and sodium bisulphite. The molten organic phase i then separated while still hot from the aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid and the refined trifluralin is recovered from the molten organic phase by washing it while hot with slightly alkaline water in order to substantially neutralise the pH and afterwards by solidifying the molten mass by cooling. The aqueous phase of hydrobromic acid separated from the molten organic phase is then added regain with sulphamic acid and bisulphite without letting the temperature decrease below 50 C and it is then re used for the treatment of a new batch of trifluralin. The tests which were performed on a laboratory scale as well as on an industrial plant allowed to verify that it is possible to recycle the solution up to twenty times at least, obtaining each time the reduction of the nitrosamin level to a value below 0.5 ppm. The refined trifluralin thus obtained was shown furthermore to be very stable against further formation of nitrosamines during the thermal treatment to which it is subjected during the further processiog which is applied to obtain the herbicidal compositions. The analyses for the determination of the nitro samines were made in every case with mass spectrography of eluates chromatographlcally separated and afterwards concentrated by means of the Kuderna Danish apparatus.Example 1 comparative 200 g of trifluralin containing 39.68 ppm of nitrosamines were introduced into a 750 ml glass flask provided with an agitator, thermometer, loading porthole, suction tube, counterflw reflux refrigerator and immersed in a thertnostatic bath. nre trifluralin was heated in the flask to 700C and then, under agitation, 80 ml of an aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid of analytical grade were added. The treatment was continued for 1 hour maintaining the temperature and agitation, the agitation was stopped and without cooling, the organic liquid phase molten trifluralin was separated from the acidic aqueous solution.The acidic solution was left in the flask and re used for further treatments of other portions of unrefined trifluralin as described above. Each time the separated trifluralin was analysed to determine the nitrosamine content. It was observed that the nitrosamine content of the treated trifluralin in the first 10 treatments was always below 0.1 ppm, while after the 10th treatment the value rose rapidly to a value above 1 ppm after the 20th treatment. No substantial differences in results from those reported were observed by varying the concentration of the hydrobromic acid in the aqueous solution from 15 to 50 j o by weight and the ratio between the volumes of acidic solution and the Wcight of the crude trifluralin between 0.2 and 0.8 and by raising the temperature of the treatment up to 900C. It was possible thus to verify that the nitrOsa mines could not be completely destroyed by re using the same solution of hydrobromic acid for more than 10 times. The same test was repeated by using hydrobromic acid of technical grade deriving from different salers. While with some kinds of technical hydrobromic acid the test gave results which were equivalent to those obtained with analytical grade hydrobromic acid, with some kinds of technical hydrobromic acid even from the first treatment it was not possible to reduce the level of nitrosamines to below 0.5 ppm, thus showing that the use of technical hydrobromic acid cannot be relied on in the industrial practice.Example 2 1200 kg of an aqueous solution of 25 by weight of technical grade hydrobromic acid density 1.23 were 3 loaded into a jacketed autoclave of 5 m capacity, provided with an inner enamel lining, counterflow reflux, loading porthole and with a bottom porthole for discharging the contents. The solution was maintained under agitation at a temperature of 700C. To said solution O.S kg of sulphamic acid and 2.0 liters of a solution of sodium bisulphite with a density of 1.3 corresponding to 0.65 kg of sulphur dioxide were added.Then 3300 kg of molten unrefined trifluralin having a content of nitrosamines of about 39 ppm were loaded into the autoclave and the whole mass was kept undcr agitation at a temperature of 700C for 3 hours. The agitation was stopped but the temperature was maintained at 700C and the reaction mass was let settle to obtain two liquid phases. The lower phase consisting of molten trifluralin was then discharged through the bottom porthole of the autoclave. The trifluralin was washed while hot with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate and then with water and delivered to storage. A sample of treated trifluralin showed a nitrosamine content of less than 0.1 ppm. 0.5 kg sulphamic acid and 2.0 liters of sodium bisuiphite were then added into the autoclave to the aqueous hydrobromic acid phase. The same results were obtained when the above described process was repeated for more than twenty times. Every five operations the strength of the hydrobromic acid was checked and restored to 25 by weight if necessary by the addition of concentrated hydrobromic acid solution.Example 3 In order to verify the heat stability of the trifluralin treated according to the process described in example 2, against the further growth of nitrosa mines, several samples of the thus obtained trifluralin were analysed after having been subjected to a thermal treatment. The refined trifluralin was stored in metal drums with a capacity of 250 kg, some of which were provided with an enamel inner lining. The drums to be analysed were randomly chosen and the nitrosamine content was determined by drawing a sample of trifluralin from the drum which had been heated up to a teniperature of about 93 95 C which is required to obtain trifluralin in the molten state. In Table I, shown hereinafter, there are indicated the nitrosamine content expressed in ppm, as determined or samples drawn at time 0, that is as soon as heating of the drum has caused full melting of the trifluralin therein contained and after having maintained the trifluralin at a temperature of 93 950C for a time of 24 and 96 hours respectively. The nitrosamine content shown in Table I corresponds to the amount of nitrosodipropylamine NDPA .TABLE IEMI13.1 tb Lot SEP No. SEP Enamel SEP NDPA SEP found SEP ppm tb SEP Lining SEP Time SEP 0 SEP h SEP Time SEP 24 SEP h SEP Time SEP 96 SEP h tb SEP 186 SEP N SEP 0.20 SEP 0.19 SEP 0.24 tb SEP 180 SEP N SEP 0.14 SEP 0.17 SEP 0.22 tb SEP 182 SEP N SEP 0.20 SEP SEP 0.38 SEP 0.59 tb SEP 188 SEP Y SEP 0.05 SEP 0.19 SEP 0.03 tb SEP 189 SEP Y SEP 0.41 SEP 0.45 SEP 0.65 tb SEP 196 SEP Y SEP 0.05 SEP 0.18 SEP 0.21 tb SEP 196 SEP Y SEP 0.07 SEP 0.09 SEP 0.11 tb SEP 192 SEP Y SEP 0.14 SEP 0.23 SEP 0.32 tb SEP 194 SEP Y SEP 0.05 SEP 0.05 SEP 0.05 tb SEP 194 SEP Y SEP SEP 0.1 SEP 0.1 SEP 0.1 tb SEP 198 SEP Y SEP 0.2 SEP 0.35 SEP 0.32 tb SEP 198 SEP Y SEP 0.35 SEP 0.40 SEP 0.38 tb SEP 202 SEP Y SEP 0.23 SEP 0.33 SEP 0.36 tb N drum without enamcl inner liningY drum with enamel inner lining The results of the NDPA analysis show the excellent stability of the product thus obtained, which only in a few cases presents a content of NDPA higher than 0.5 ppm following the most severe heat treatment at 93 950C for 9G hours.Example 4 comparative In order to verify the increased stability against nitrosamines formation of the refined trifluralin obtained by the process of the invention, comparative tests were carried out by treating the crude trlfluralin br the conventional process consisting of treatment with a hydrochloric acid solution. The experimental tests were conducted on a laboratory scale by means of a 6 1 glass flask provided with agitator, thermometer and reflux condensor. The unrefined trifluralin introduced into said flask was treated with a 30 wt hydrochloric acid solution 10 wt with respect to the trifluralin weight at 700C for 3 hours. Further experiments were carried out by adding to the hydrochloric acid solution 0.250 g sulphamic acid tests la, ib and 3 in Table II hereinafter . After each treatment, the trifluralin was separated from the hydrochloric acid solution and neutralised with an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. The thus obtained trifluralin was stored in metal containers having a capacity of 0.25 kg, some of which were provided with an enamel lining. The stability tests were carried out by heating the containers to a temperature in the range of 93 950C and the NDPA content was measured at time 0, and after 24 and 96 hours as described in ex ple 2. The obtained results are summarised in Table II.

It is believed that the advantages as to the stability of trifluralin are inherent to the use of hydrobromic acid solution which is made possible and economically advantageous owing to the process of the invention. It may in fact be postulated that the treatment by hydrobromic acid avoids the formation of di alkyl amines which are present at least partially also in the organic trifluralin phase and which in turn may react with nitrogen oxides which are present in the atmosphere to give nitrosamines derivatives. In order to verify the above hypothesis the fo following tests were carried out. Example 5 In these experimental tests, it was used crude trifiu ralln deriving from the ai iination reaction according to equation 1, shown hereinbefore, between di n propzlamine DPA and 4 triflouromethyl 2,6 dinitro chlo ro benzene PN cl in the presence of an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. A portion of the trifluralin was used as such, whereat a second portion was subjected to repeated crystallization to obtain a pure product. Both portions were separately treated for 3 hours at 900C under stirring with 10 by weight, referred to the weight oY trifluralin, of an aqueous solution of 30 wt tests 2 and 6 and respectively 37 wt tests 3 and 7 of hyrochloric acid and with an amount of 30 wt, with respect to trifluralin, of an aqueous 30 wt HBr solution tests 4 and 8 . At the end of the treatment the trifluralin product was separated by decantation from the aqueous acidic soluticn and washed with an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate at 60 700C to neutralize the pH.According to tests 3 and 7 the treatment with fresh 37 wt HC1 was repeated twice. The thus obtained refined product was analysed by FID gas chromatography.

The corresponding bromo derivative DN Br was not found in the trifluralin treated by hydrobromic acid solution. It is believed that the formation of the above mentioned chloro derivative is accompanied by the formation of di n propylamine as a result of the reversal of the reaction I cited hereinbefore. The process according to the invention is therefore advantageous with respect to both the quality of the reined trifluralin which is thereby obtained and to the economical cost of the process proper. In fact the possibility of re using the hydrobromic acid solution for several recyclings makes pr ofitable the use thereof and furthermore the possibility of regenerating by distillation the solution of hydrobroriic acid which is spent after several recyclings, avoids the problems relating to the discharge of the effluents from the plant and reduces the consumption of hydrobromic acid to almost stoichiometric levels.
