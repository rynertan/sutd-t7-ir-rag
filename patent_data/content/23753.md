# Method and apparatus of making welded metallic can bodies.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus of making welded metallic can bodies, and an improvement in welded can bodies by ef fecting a mash resistance welding on a lapped side portion 2 of a can body preform 1 by means of a combination of a cooled elongated electrode 6 and a cooled rotary electrode 11 and, as required, with wire electrodes 30 interposed between the lapped side portion 2 and these electrodes 6 , 11 . A tinfree steel welded can body 48 and its making method wherein it is formed by a mash resistance welding on a lapped side portion 2 of a can body preform 1 made from tinfree steel, without requiring the removal of surface chromium film from the welded portion 2a and its vicinity.
