# An LED light source device for a pulse encoder.

## Abstract
In a LED light source device for a pulse encoder, a plurality of LEDs LED 21...LED 23 are divided into a plurality of groups and each of said groups is included in one of the branches connected across the power source. At least one dummy LED D LED or dummy diode is con nected in series with the LED in a predetermined one of said branches, so that the voltage drop characteristics of said branches are equalized.
