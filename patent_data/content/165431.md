# Data transfer apparatus having a magnetic transducer head capable of proper data transfer contact with a flexible magnetic dick without fine adjustment.

## Abstract
A flexible magnetic disk drive 18 is disclosed which has a transducer head 32 requiring little or no positional or angular readjustment for proper data transfer contact with a flexible magnetic disk 10 in the face of possible dimension al or mounting errors. The transducer head 32 has a rounded contact surface 70 for data transfer contact with the flexible magnetic disk 10 , in which surface 74 is defined a transducing gap typically a read write gap. The transducing gap 74 is offset toward the axis 94 of the magnetic disc 10 from a notional line 98 right angularly crossing, at the apex 96 of the contact surface 70 , another notional line 92 connecting the apex 96 of the contact surface 70 and the center 34 of the magnetic disk 10 . So positioned on the contact surface 70 , the transducing gap 74 is practically free from the wobbling motion of that part of the rotating magnetic disk 10 which is radially outward of its points of contact with the transducer head 32 and with a pressure pad 54 . The transducing gap 74 can be arranged on the contact surface 70 as above merely by mounting a transducer head 32 of standard construction in a slanting attitude on a carriage 34 which transports both the head 32 and the pressure pad 54 radially of the magnetic disk 10 .
