## Description
BACXGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention is concerned with the combusting of solid, sulfur containing material in a manner to effect a reduction in the emission of sulfur oxides to the atmosphere. In one specific embodiment, the invention involves the catalytic cracking of sulfurcontaining hydrocarbon feed stocks in a manner to effect a reduction in the amount of sulfur oxides emitted from the regeneration zone of a hydrocarbon catalytic cracking unit. Typically, catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons takes place in a reaction zone at hydrocarbon cracking conditions to produce at least one hydrocarbon product and to cause carbonaceous material coke to be deposited on the catalyst. Additionally, some sulfur, originally present in the feed hydrocarbons, may also be deposited, e.g., as a component of the coke, on the catalyst.It has been reported that approximately 50 of the feed sulfur is converted to H2S in the FCC reactor1 40 remains in the liquid products and about 4 to 10 is deposited on the catalyst. These amounts vary with the type of feed, rate of hydrocarbon recycle, steam stripping rate, the type of catalyst, reactor temperature7 etc. sulfur containing coke deposits tend to deactivate cracking catalyst. Cracking catalyst is advantageously continuously regenerated, by combustion with oxygencontaining gas in a regeneration zone, to low coke levels, typically below about 0.4 by weight, to perform satisfactorily when it is recycled to the reactor. In the regeneration zone, at least a portion of sulfur, along with carbon and hydrogen, which is deposited on the catalyst, is oxidized and leaves in the form of sulfur oxides SO2 and 5031 hereinafter referred to as SOx along with substantial amounts of CO, CO2 and H2O. Considerable amount of study and research effort has been directed to reducing oxide of sulfur emissions from various gaseous streams, including those from the stacks of the regenerators of FCC units. However, the results leave much to be desired. Many metallic compounds have been proposed as materials to pick uP oxides of sulfur in FCC units and other desulfurization apcli cations and a variety of supports, including particles of cracking catalysts and inverts , have been suggested as carriers for active metallic reactants. Many of the proposed metallic reactants lose effectiveness when subjected to repeated cycling. Thus when GroupII metal oxides are impregnated on FCC catalysts or various supports, the activity of the Group II metals is rapidly reduced under the influence of the cyclic conditions.Discrete alumina particles, when combined with silicacontaining catalyst particles and subjected to steam at elevated temperatures, e.g., those present in FCC unit regenerators, are of limited effectiveness in reducing SOx emissions. Incorporation of sufficient chromium on an alumina support to improve SOx sorption results in undersirably increased coke and gas production. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is the provision of an improved composition and process for reducing emissions of sulfur oxides. An additional object of the present invention is to provide an improved composition and process for reducing the emissions of sulfur oxides from the regeneration zones of hydrocarbon catalytic cracking units. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved hydrocarbon conversion catalyst. These and other objects of the invention will become apparent from the following description and examples. In one general aspect, the present invention involves a process for combusting solid, sulfur containing material by contacting the material with gaseous oxygen in a combustion zone at combustion conditions to produce combustion products including sulfur oxide at least a portion of which is sulfur trioxide. The present improvement comprises carrying out this contacting in the presence of discrete entities containing an effective amount, preferably a major amount by weight, of at least one metal containing spinel, preferably alkaline earth metal containing spinel, to thereby reduce the amount of sulfur oxide relative to combustion in the essential absence of the discrete entities emitted from the combustion zone.In another embodiment, the present improvement comprises carrying out this contacting in the presence of discrete entities containing an effective amount, preferably a major amount by weight, of at least one alkaline earth metal containing spinel and a minor amount of at least one rare earth metal component associated with the spinel to thereby reduce the amount of sulfur oxide relative to combustion in the essential absence of the discrete entities emitted from the combustion zone. In accordance with another aspect, the present invention involves a conversion process which is carried out, preferably in the substantial absence of added free hydrogen, in at least one chemical reaction zone in which sulfur containing hydrocarbon feedstock is contacted with particulate material to form at least one hydrocarbon product and sulfur containing carbonaceous material deposited on the particulate material and at least one regeneration zone in which at least a portion of the sulfur containing carbonaceous material deposited on the solid particles is contacted with gaseous oxygen to combust the sulfur containing carbonaceous material and to produce combustion products including sulfur oxide at least a portion of which is sulfur trioxide. The present improvement comprises using a particulate material comprising A a major amount of solid particles capable of promoting the desired hydrocarbon chemical conversion at hydrocarbon conversion conditions and B a minor amount of discrete entities comprising an effective amount, preferably a major amount of weight, i.e., at least about 50 by weight, of at least one metal containing spinel, preferably alkaline earth metal containing spinel. In the event such discrete entities comprise alkaline earth metal containing spinel, it is more preferred that such discrete entities further comprise a minor amount of at least one rare earth metal, preferably, cerium, component associated with the spinel.In one pre ferred embodiment, the discrete entities also include a minor, catalytically effective amount of at least one crystalline aluminosilicate effective to promote hydrocarbon conversion, e.g., cracking at hydrocarbon conversion conditions. The discrete entities are present in an amount sufficient to reduce the amount of sulfur oxides in the regeneration zone effluent when used in a reaction zone regeneration zone system as described herein. In one preferred embodiment, the particulate material, more preferably the discrete entities, further comprise a minor amount of at least one additional metal, e.g., a Group VIII platinum group metal, component capable of promoting the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide at the conditions in the regeneration zone. The preferred platinum group metals are palladium and platinum, most preferably platinum. The preferred relative amounts of the solid particles and discrete entities are about 80 to about 99 parts and 1 to about 20 parts by weight, respectively. This catalyst system is especially effective for the catalytic cracking of a hydrocarbon feedstock to lighter, lower boiling products. The present catalyst system prefer ably also has improved carbon monoxide oxidation catalytic activity stability. The improvement of this invention can be used to advantage with the catalyst being disposed in any conventional reactor regenerator system, in ebullating catalyst bed systems, in systems which involve continuously conveying or circulating catalyst between reaction zone and regeneration zone and the like. Circulating catalyst systems are preferred. Typical of the circulating catalyst bed systems are the conventional moving bed and fluidized bed reactor regenerator systems. Both of these circulating bed systems are conventionally used in hydrocarbon conversion, e.g., hydrocarbon cracking, operations with the fluidized catalyst bed reactor regenerator systems being preferred. The catalyst system used in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention is comprised of a mixture of two types of solid particles. Although the presently useful solid particles and discrete entities may be used as a physical admixture of separate particles, in one embodiment the discrete entities are combined as part of the solid particles.That is, the discrete entities, e.g., comprising calcined microspheres containing metal containing spinel, and preferably, at least one additional metal component, are combined with the solid particles, e.g., during the manufacture of the solid particles, to form combined particles which function as both the presently useful solid particles and discrete entities is preferably a separate and distinct phase. One preferred method for providing the combined particles is to calcine the discrete entities prior to incorporating the discrete entities into the combined particles. The form, i.e., particle size, of the present catalyst particles, e.g., both solid particles and discrete entities, as well as the combined particles, is not critical to the present invention and may vary depending, for example, on the type of reaction regeneration system employed. Such catalyst particles may be formed into any desired shape such a pills, cakes, extrudates, powders, granules, spheres and the like, using conventional methods. With regard to fluidized catalyst bed systems, it is preferred that the major amount by weight of the present catalyst particles have a diameter in the range of about 10 microns to about 250 microns, more preferably about 20 microns to about 150 microns. The solid particles are capable of promoting the desired hydrocarbon conversion. The solid particles are further characterized as having a composition i.e., chemical make up which is different from the discrete entities. In one preferred embodiment, the solid particles or the solid particles portion of the combined particles described above are substantially free of metal containing spinel, e.g., alkaline earth metalcontaining spine 1. In one aspect of the present invention, the discrete entities comprise an effective amount of at least one metal containing spinel, preferably alkaline earth metal containing spinel, and preferably, a minor, catalytically effective amount of at least one crystalline aluminosilicate capable of promoting hydrocarbon conversion at hydrocarbon conversion conditions. In the event such discrete entities comprise alkaline earth metal containing spinel, it is more preferred that such discrete entities include a minor amount of at least one rare earth metal component, preferably a cerium component, associated with the spinel.In another aspect of the present invention, the discrete entities, whether present as a separate and distinct particle and or combined with the solid particles in a single, preferably substantially uniform, mass of combined particles, and or the solid particles and or one or more other type of particles i.e., having compositions different from the present solid particles and discrete entities further comprise a minor amount of at least one additional metal, e.g., platinum group metal, component capable of promoting the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to the sulfur trioxide at the conditions in the combustion, e.g., catalyst regeneration, zone.For example, an effective amount of at least one sulfur oxide oxidation catalytic component, e.g., metal or compounds of metals selected from Group VI, IIB, IVB, VIA, VIB, VIZA and VIII and mixtures thereof, disposed on a support, e.g., one or more inorganic oxides, may be included with the present solid particles and discrete entities and or may be included on the solid particles and or discrete entities. As noted previously, the sulfur oxide oxidation component may be associated with, erg., deposited on, the spinel component of the present discrete entities. The composition of the solid particles useful in the present invention is not critical, provided that such particles are capable of promoting the desired hydrocarbon conversion. Particles having widely varying compositions are conventionally used as catalyst in such hydrocarbon conversion processes, the particular composition chosen being dependent, for example, on the type of hydrocarbon chemical conversion desired.Thus, the solid particles suitable for use in the present invention include at least one of the natural or synthetic materials which are capable of promoting the desired hydrocarbon chemical conversion. For example, when the desired hydrocarbon conversion involves one or more of hydrocarbon cracking, disproportionation, isomeri zation, polymerization, alkylation and dealkylation, such suitable materials include acid treated natural clays such as montmorillonite, kaolin and bentonite clays natural or synthetic amorphous materials, such as amorphous silica alumina, silica magnesia and silica zirconia composites crystalline aluminosilicates often referred to as zeolites or molecular sieves and the like. In certain instances, e.g., hydrocarbon cracking and disproportionaticn, the solid particles preferably include such crystalline aluminosilicate to increase catalytic activity. Methods for preparing such solid particles and the combined solid particles discrete entities particles are conventional and well known in the art. Certain of these procedures are thoroughly described in U.S. Patents 3,140,253 and RE. 27,639. Compositions of the solid particles which are particularly useful in the present invention are those in which the crystalline aluminosilicate is incorporated, in an amount effective to promote the desired hydrocarbon conversion, e.g., a catalytically effective amount, into a porous matrix which comprises, for example, amorphous material which may or may not be itself capable of promoting such hydrocarbon conversion. Included among such matrix materials are clays and amorphous compositions of silica alumina, magnesia, zirconia, mixtures of these and the like. The crystalline aluminosilicate is preferably incorporated into the matrix material in amounts within the range of about 1 to about 75 , more preferably about 2 to about 50 , by weight of the total solid particles.The preparation of crystalline alu..inosilicate amorphous matrix catalytic materials is described in the above mentioned patents. Catalytically active crystalline alurinosilicates which are formed during and or as part of the methods of manufacturing the sclid particles, discrete entities and or combined particles are within the scope of the present invention. The solid particles are preferably substantially free of added rare earth metal, e.g., cerium,component disposed on the amorphous matrix material of the catalyst, although such rare earth metal components may be associated with the crystalline aluminosilicate components of the solid particles. As indicated above, the discrete entities utilized in the present invention comprise an effective amount, preferably a major amount, of at least one metal containing spinel, preferably alkaline earth metal containing spinel. In another aspect, the present discrete entities further comprise a minor amount of at least one additional metal, e.g., platinum group metal, component capable of promoting sulfur dioxide oxidation. The spinel structure is based on a cubic close packed array of oxide ions. Typically, the crystallographic unit cell of the spinel structure con tains 32 oxygen atoms one eighth of the tetrahedral holes of which there are two per anion are occupied by divalent metal ion, and one half of the octahedral holes of which there are two per anion are occupied by trivalent metal ions. This typical spinel structure or a modification thereof is adaptable to many other mixed metal oxides of the type MI M2I I04 e.g., FeCr2o4,GnA1204 and Co11Co211104 , by some of the type MIVMI 204 e.g., Tin204, and SnCo2O4 , and by some of the type M2IMVIO4 e.g.,Na2MoO4 and Ag2MoO4 . This structure is often symbolized as X Y2 O4, where square brackets enclose the ions in the octahedral interstices.An important variant is the inverse spinel structure,Y XY 04, in which half of the Y ions are in tetrahedral interstices and the X ions are in octahedral ones along with the other half of the Y ions. The inverse spinel structure is intended to be included within the scope of the term metal containing spinel as used herein. The inverse spinel structure occurs often when the X ions have a stronger preference for octahedral coordination than do the 7 ions. All MIVM II 2 04 are inverse, e.g., n nTi O4, and many of the MIIM2IIIO4 ones are also, e.g., FeIII CoIIFeIII O4,NiAl2O4,FeIII FeIIFeIII O4 and Fe NiFe O4. There are also many compounds with distorted spinel structures in which only a fraction of the X ions are in tetrahedral sites.This occurs when the preference of both X and Y ions for octahedral and tetrahedral sites do not differ markedly. Further details on the spinel structure are described in the following references, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference Modern Aspects of Inorganic Chemistry by H. I. Emeleus and A. G. Sharpe 1973 , pp. 57 58 and 512 513 Structural Inorganic Chemistry , 3rd edition, 1962 by A. F. Wells, pp. 130, 487 490, 503 and 526 and AdvancedInorganic Chemistry , 3rd edition, by F. A. Cotton and G.Wilkinson 1972 , pp. 54 55. Metal containing spinels include the following MnAl2O4, FeAl2O4, CoAl2O4, NiAl2O4, ZnAl2O4, MgTiMgO41 FeMgFeO4, FeTiFeO4, ZnSnZnO4, GaMgGaO4, InMgInO4, BeLi2F4, SLi2O43 MoLi2O4, SnMg2O4, MgAl2O4, CuAl2O4, LiAl5O8 , ZnK2 CN 41 CdK2 CN 4, HgK2 CN 41 ZnTi2O4, FeV2O4, MgCr2O4,MnCr2O4, FeCr2O4, CoCr204, NiCr2O4, ZnCr2O41 GdCr204, MnCr2S4, ZnCr254, CdCr2S41 TiMn2O4, MnFe2O41 FeFe2O4, CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, CuFe2O4, ZnFe2O4, CdFe204, MgCo2O4, TiCo2O4, CoCo2O4, ZnCo204, SnCo2O4, CoCo2S41 CuCo2S4, GeNi204, NiNi2S4, ZnGa2O4, WAg2O4, and ZnSn204. The preferred metal containing spinels for use in the present invention are alkaline earth metal spinels, in particular magnesium aluminate spinel. Lithium containing spinels,which may be produced using conventional techniques are also preferred for use. With regard to magnesium aluminate spinel, there often are eight Mg atoms and sixteen Al atoms to place in a unit cell 8MgA1204 . Other alkaline earth metal ions, such as calcium, strontium, barium and mixtures thereof, may replace all or a part of the magnesium ions. Similarly, other trivalent metal ions, such as iron, chormium, vanadium, manganese, gallium, boron, cobalt and mixtures thereof, may replace all or a part of the aluminum ions. The metal containing spinels useful in the present invention may be derived from conventional and well known sources. For example, these spinels may be naturally occurring or may be synthesized using techniques well known in the art. Thus, a detailed description of such techniques is not included herein. However, a brief description of the preparation of the most preferred spinel, i.e., magnesium aluminate spinel, is set forth below. Certain of the techniques described, e.g., drying and calcining, have applicability to other metal containing spinels. The magnesium aluminate spinel suitable for use in the present invention can be prepared, for example, according to the method disclosed in U.S. Patent No.2,992,191. The spinel can be formed by reacting, in an aqueous medium, a water soluble magnesium inorganic salt and a water soluble aluminum salt in which the aluminum is present in the anion. Suitable salts are exemplified by the strongly acidic magnesium salts such as the chloride, nitrate or sulfate and the water soluble alkali metal aluminates. The magnesium and aluminate salts are dissolved in an aqueous medium and a spinel precursor is precipitated through neutralization of the aluminate by the acidic magnesium salt. Excesses of acid salt or aluminate are preferably not employed, thus avoiding the precipitation of excess magnesia or alumina. Preferably, the precipitate is washed free of extraneous ions before being further processed. The precipitate can be dried and calcined to yield the magnesium aluminate spinel. Drying and calcination may take place simultaneously. However, it is preferred that the drying take place at a temperature below which water of hydration is removed from the spinel precursor. Thus, this drying may occur at temperatures below about S000F., preferably from about 220 F. to about 4500F. Suitable calcination temperatures are exemplified by temperatures ranging from about 8000F. to about 20000F.or more. Calcination of the spinel precursor may take place in a period of time of at least about one half hour and preferably in a period of time ranging from about 1 hour to about 10 hours. Another process for producing the presently useful magnesium aluminate spinel is set forth in U.S.Patent 3,791,992. This process includes mixing a solution of a soluble acid salt of divalent magnesium with a solution of an alkali metal aluminate separating and washing the resulting precipitate exchanging the washed precipitate with a solution of an ammonium compound to decrease the alkali metal content followed bW washing, drying, forming and calcination steps. The disclosure of U.S. Patent 3,791,992 is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In general, as indicated previously, the metalcontaining spinels useful in the present invention may be prepared by methods which are conventional and well known in the art. The metal spinel based composition may be formed into particles of any desired shape such as pills, cake, extrudates, powders, granules, spheres, and the like using conventional methods. The size selected for the particles can be dependent upon the intended environment in which the final discrete entities are to be used as, for example, whether in a fixed catalyst bed or circulating catalyst bed reaction system or whether as a separate.particle or as part of a mass of combined particles. Substantially non interfering proportions of other well known refractory material, e.g., inorganic oxides such as silica, zirconia, thoria and the like may be included in the present discrete entities. Free magnesia and or alumina i.e., apart from the alkaline earth metal containing spinel also may be included in the discrete entities, e.g., using conventional techniques. For example, the discrete ent ties may include about 0.1 to about 25 by weight of free magnesia calculated as MgO . By substantially non interferring is meant amounts of other material which do not have a substantial deleterious effect on the present catalyst system or hydrocarbon conversion process. The inclusion of materials such as silica, zirconia, thoria and the like into the present discrete entities may act to improve one or more of the functions of the discrete entities. The presently useful lithium containing spinels, e.g., lithium aluminate spinel, preferably are associated with a minor amount of at least one rare earth metal component. Cerium or other suitable rare earth or rare earth mixture may be associated with the spinel using any suitable technique or combination of techniques for example, impregnation, coprecipitation, ion exchange and the like, well known in the art, with impregnation being preferred. Impregnation may be carried out by contacting the spinel with a solution, preferably aqueous, of rare earth for example, a solution containing cerium ions preferably Ce 3, Ce 4 or mixtures thereof or a mixture of rare earth cations containing a substantial amount for example, at least 40 of cerium ions. Water soluble sources of rare earth include the nitrate and chloride. Solutions having a concentration of rare earth in the range of 3 to 30 by weight are preferred.Preferably, sufficient rare earth salt is added to incorporate about 0.05 to 25 weight , more preferably about 0.1 to 15 rare earth, and still more preferably about 1.0 to 15 rare earth, by weight, calculated as elemental metal, on the particles. It may not be necessary to wash the spinel after certain soluble rare earth salts such as nitrate or acetate are added. After impregnation with rare earth salt, the spinel can be dried and calcined to decompose the salt, forming an oxide in the case of nitrate or acetate. Alternatively, the spinel, e.g., in the fprm of discrete particles, can be charged to a hydrocarbon conversion, e.g., cracking unit, with the rare earth in salt form. In this case a rare earth salt with a thermally decomposable anion can decompose to the oxide in the reactor and be available to associate withSOx in the regenerator. Especially good results were achieved using spinel containing discrete entities such that the concentration of rare earth metal, e.g., cerium, calculated as the metal, is in the range of about 1 to 25 , more preferably about 2 to about 15 , by weight of the total discrete entities. The present discrete entities preferably further comprise a minor amount of at least one crystalline aluminosilicate capable of promoting the desired hydrocarbon conversion. Typical aluminosilicates have been described above. Preferably, such aluminosilicates comprise about 1 to about 30 , more preferably about 1 to about 10 , by weight of the discrete entities. The presence of such aluminosilicates in the present discrete entities acts to increase the overall catalytic activity of the solid particles discrete entities mixture for promoting the desired hydrocarbon conversion. As indicated above, in one preferred embodiment the presently useful particulate material, e.g., the discrete entities utilized in the present invention, also contain at least one additional metal, e.g., platinum group metal, component. These additional metal components are defined as being capable of promoting the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide at combustion conditions, e.g., the conditions present in the catalyst regenerator. Increased carbon monoxide oxidation may also be obtained by including at least one of the additional metal components.Such metal components are selected from the group consisting ofGroup IB, IIB, IVB, VIA, VIB, VIIA and VIII of the PeriodicTable, the rare earth metals, vanadium, iron, tin and antimony and mixtures thereof and may be incorporated into the presently useful particulate material, e.g., the discrete entities, in any suitable manner. Many techniques for including the additional metal in the particulate material are conventional and well known in the art. The additional metal, e.g., platinum group metal, such as platinum, may exist within the particulate material, e.g., discrete entities, at least in part as a compound such as an oxide, sulfide, halide and the like, or in the elemental state. Generally, the amount of the platinum group metal component present in the final discrete entities is small compared to the quantity of the spinel.The platinum group metal component preferably comprises from about 0.05 parts per million ppm to about 1 , more preferably about 0.05 ppm. to about 1,000 ppm., and still more preferably about 0.5 ppm. to about 500 ppm., by weight of the discrete entities, calculated on an elemental basis. Excellent results are obtained when the discrete entities contain about 50 ppm. to about 200 ppm., and in particular about 50 ppm. to about 90 ppm., by weight of at least one platinum group metal component. The other additional metals may be included in the particulate material in an amount effective to promote the oxidation of at least a portion, preferably a major portion, of the sulfur dioxide present to sulfur trioxide at the conditions of combustion, e.g., conditions present in the catalyst regeneration zone of a hydrocarbon catalytic cracking unit. Preferably, the present discrete entities comprise a minor amount by weight of at least one additional metal component calculated as elemental metal . Of course the amount of additional metal used will depend, for example, on the degree of sulfur dioxide oxidation desired and the effectiveness of the additional metal component to promote such oxidation. Alternately to inclusion in the discrete entities, one or more additional metal components may be present in all or a portion of the above noted solid particles and or may be included in a type of particle other than either the present solid particles or discrete entities. For example, separate particles comprising at least one additional metal component and porous inorganic oxide support, e.g., platinum on alumina, may be included along with the solid particle and discrete entities to promote sulfur dioxide oxidation. The additional metal, e.g., platinum group metal, component may be associated with the spinel based composi tion in any suitable manner, such as by the impregnation of the spinel at any stage in its preparation and either after or before calcination of the spinel based composition. As indicated previously, various procedures for incorporating the additional metal component or components into the particulate material are conventional and well known in the art.Preferably, the additional metal component is substantially uniformly disposed on the spinel of the present discrete entities. One preferred method for adding the platinum group metal to the spinel involves the utilization of a water soluble compound of the platinum group metal to impregnate the spinel. For example, platinum may be added to the spinel by comingling the spinel with an aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid. Other water soluble compounds of platinum may be employed as impregnation solutions, including, for example, ammonium chloroplatinate and platinum chloride. Both inorganic and organic compounds of the platinum group metals are useful for incorporating the platinum group metal component into the present discrete entities. Platinum group metal compounds, such as chlorplatinic acid and palladium chloride are preferred. It may be desirable to be able to separate the discrete entities from the solid particles, for example, when it is desired to use the solid particles alone for hydrocarbon conversion or where it is desired to recover the discrete entities for other uses or for example, for platinum group metal recovery. This can be conveniently accomplished by preparing the second solid particles in a manner such that they have a different size than the first solid particles. The separation of the first and second solid particles can then be easily effected by screening or other means of size segregation. As noted above, the presently useful solid partiles and discrete entities can be employed in a mass of combined particles which function as both the solid particles, e.g., promotes hydrocarbon conversion, and the discrete entities. Such combined particles may be produced in any suitable manner, certain of which methods are conventional and known in the art. Although this invention is useful in many hydrocarbon chemical conversions, the present catalyst, i.e., mixture comprising solid particles and discrete entities, and process find particular applicability in systems for the catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons and the regeneration of catalyst so employed. Such catalytic hydrocarbon cracking often involves converting1 i.e., cracking, heavier or higher boiling hydrocarbons to gasoline and other lower boiling components, such as hexane, hexene, pentane, pentene, butane, butylene, propane, propyiene, ethane, ethylene, methane and mixtures thereof. Often, the substantially hydrocarbon feedstock coprises a gas oil fraction, e.g., derived from petroleum, shale oil, tar sand oil, coal and the like.Such feedstock may comprise a mixture of straight run, e.g., virgin, gas oil. Such gas oil fractions often boil primarily in the range of about 400 F. to about 1000QF. Other substantially hydrocarbon feedstocks, e.g., other high boiling or heavy fractions of petroleum, shale oil, tar sand oil, coal and the like may be cracked using the catalyst and method of the present invention. Such substantially hydrocarbon feedstock often contains rinor amounts of contaminants, e.g., sulfur, nitrogen and the like. In one aspect, the present invention involves converting a hydrocarbon feedstock containing sulfur and or sulfur chemically combined with the molecules of hydrocarbon feedstock. The present invention is particularly useful when the amount of. sulfur in such hydrccarbon feedstock is in the range of about 0.018 to about 5t, preferably about 0.1t to about 3 , by weight of the total feedstock. Hydrocarbon cracking conditions are well known and often include temperatures in the range of about 850 F. to about la0BOF., preferably about 900 F to about 1050if. Other reaction conditions usually include pressures of up to about 100 psia., catalyst to oil ratios of about 1 to 2 to about 25 to I, preferably about 3 to 1 to about 15 to 1 and weight hourly space velocities haSV of from about 3 to about 60.These hydrocarbon cracking conditions may be varied depending, for example, on the feedstock and solid particles or combined particles being used and the product or products wanted. In addition, the catalytic hydrocarbon cracking system includes a regeneration zone for restoring the catalytic activity of the solid particles or combined particles of catalyst previously used to promote hydrocarbon cracking. Carbonaceous, in particular sulfur containing carbonaceous, deposit containing catalyst particles from the reaction zone are contacted with free oxygencontaining gas in the regeneration zone at conditions to restore or maintain the activity of the catalyst by removing, i.e., combusting, at least a portion of the carbonaceous material from the catalyst particles.When the carbonaceous deposit material contains sulfur, at least one sulfur containing combustion product is produced in the regeneration zone and may leave the zone with the regenerator flue gas. The conditions at which such free oxygen containing gas contacting takes place may vary, for example, over conventional ranees.The temperature in the catalyst regeneration zone of a hydrocarbon cracking system is often in the range of about 9000F. to about 15000F., preferably about 11000F. to about 13500F. and more preferably about 11000F.to about 13000F. Other conditions within such regeneration zone may include, for example, pressures up to about 100 psia., average catalyst contact times within the range of about 3 minutes to about 120 minutes, preferably from about 3 minutes to about 75 minutes. Sufficient oxygen is preferably present in the regeneration zone to completely combust the carbon and hydrogen of the carbonaceous deposit material, for example, to carbon dioxide and water. The amount of carbonaceous material deposited on the catalyst in the reaction zone is preferably in the range of about 0.0056 to about 15 , more preferably about 0.1 to about 5 by weight of the catalyst. The amount of carbonaceous material deposited on the catalyst in the reaction zone is preferably in the range of about 0.005g to about 15t, more Preferably about 0.1t to about 10 , by weight of the catalyst.The amount of sulfur, if any, contained in the carbonaceous deposit material depends, for example, on the amount of sulfur in the hydrocarbon feedstock. This deposit material may contain about 0.01 to about 108 or more by weight of sulfur. At least a portion of the regenerated catalyst is often returned to the hydrocarbon cracking reaction zone. The solid particles useful in the catalytic hydrocarbon cracking embodiment of the present invention may be any conventional catalyst capable of promoting hdroarbon crackling at the conditions present in the reaction zone, i.e., hydrocarbon cracking conditions,Similarly, the catalytic activity of such solid particles is restored at the conditions present in the regeneration zone. Typical among these conventional catalysts are those which comprise amorphous silica alumina and at least one crystalline aluminosilicate having pore diameters of about 8 to about 15 and mixtures thereof.When the solid particles and or discrete entities to be used in the hydrocarbon cracking embodiment of the present invention contain crystalline aluminosilicate, the crystalline aluminosilicate may include minor amounts of conventional metal proznoters such as the rare earth metals, in particular, cerium. As indicated previously, one embodiment of the present invention involves contacting solid, sulfur containing material in a combustion zone at combustion conditions to produce combustion products including at least one sulfur oxide at least a portion of which is sulfur trioxide. Reduced emissions of sulfur oxide from the combustion zone are achieved by carrying out this contacting in the presence of discrete entities containing at least one alkaline earth metal spinel and at least one rare earth metal component. Typical solid material combustion zones include, for example, fluid bed coal burning steam boilers and fluid sand bed waste combustors. The present discrete entities have sufficient strength to withstand the conditions in such combustion zones. In the coal fired boiler application, the discrete entities are added, either separately or with the sulfur containing coal, to the combustion zone, e.g., boiler, where combustion takes place and at least some sulfur triode is formed. The discrete entities leave the combustion zone with the coal ash and can be separated from the ash, e.g., by screening, density separation, or other well knoum solids separation techniques.The flue gases leaving the combustion zone have reduced amounts cf sulfur oxide, e.g., relative to combustion in the absence of the discrete entities. The discrete entities from the combustion zone can then be subjected to a reducing enxtiron ment, e.g., contacted with H2, at conditions such that at least a portion of the sulfur associated with the discrete entities disassociates with the discrete entities, e.g., in the form of H2S, and is removed for further processing, e.g., sulfur recovery. The discrete entities, after sulfur removal may be recycled to the combustion zone, e.g., boiler. Conditions within the boiler may be those typically used in fluid bed coal burning boilers. The amount of discrete entities used is sufficient to reduce sulfur oxide emissions in the boiler flue gas, preferably, by at least about 50 and more preferably by at least about 80 . Conditions within the reducing zone are such that at least a portion, preferably at least about 50 and more preferably at least about 80 of the sulfur associated with the discrete entities is removed. For example, reducing conditions may include terperatures in the range of amount 9000F. to about 18oOeF. pressures in the range of about 14 to about 100 psia and H2 to associated sulfur mole ratio in the range of about 1 to about 10. In the fluid sand bed waste combustion application, the fluid sand1 e.g., which acts as a heat sink, may be combined with the discrete entities and circulated from the combustion zone to the reduction zone. Reduced emissions of sulfur oxide from the combustion zone are thus achieved. Conditions in the combustion zone may be as typically employed in fluid sand bed waste combustors. The amount of discrete entities employed is sufficient to reduce sulfur oxide emissions in the combuster flue gases, preferably by at least about 50 and more preferably by at least about 80 . Conditions within the reducing zone are similar to those set forth above for the coal fired boiler application. The following examples are provided to better illustrate the invention, without limitation, by presenting several specific embodiments of the process of the invention. EXAMPLE I This example illustrates the production of discrete entities useful in the present invention. 7.05 Ib. sodium aluminate analyzed as 29.8 by weight Na2O and 44.858 by weight of A12O3 was stirred with one gallon deionized water to bring as much as possible into solution. This was filtered through cloth with a 10 Buchner funnel. The filtered solution was diluted to 8 liters with deionized water. 7.95 Ib. Mg N O 26H2O was dissolved in one gallon deionized watEr, and 166 ml. of concentrated SINO3 was added.The solution was diluted to 8 liters with deionized water. The two final solutions were run simultaneously from burettes into 32 liters deionized water in a 30 gallon rubber lined drum. The mix was stirred vigorously during the addition. Addition of the Mg NO3 2 solution required 36 minutes. 2760 ml. of the sodium aluminate solution was added during this period. The pH was held between 7.0 and 7.5.After addition of all the magnesium nitrate containing solution, sodium aluminate solution was added to bring the pH to 8.5. After this, 1080 ml. of sodium aluminate solution remained and was discarded. The mix was held overnight and then filtered with a plate frame press. The cake was washed in the press with 110 gallons deionized water. The cake was reslurried in 10 gallons deionized water. A solution of 26 grams Mg O3 26H2o in 200 ml. deionized water was added to the slurry. The slurry was filtered and washed as before. After a repeat of the slurry, filter, and wash, the cake was dried at about 250 F. in a forced air drying oven. The dried product was then hammermilled, first on a 0.050 screen, then the 0 60 mesh portion was hammermilled again, this time on the 0.010 screen. The desirable, fine material was then screened through a 60 mesh screen. The so obtained product, magnesium aluminate spinel precursor, was then transferred into a 59 mm diameter quartz tube, where it was calcined, in a fluidized state, for 3 hours at 9000F. with an air flow rate of about 106 liters per hour to form magnesium aluminate spinel. The resulting magnesium aluminate spinel particles are screened to produce final particles having diameters less than 100 microns. EXAMPLE II Example I is repeated except that final magnesium aluminate spinel particles are impregnated, using conventional techniques, with an aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid. The resulting particles are dried and calcined and contain about 100 ppm. of platinum, by weight of the total platinum containing particles, calculated as elemental platinum. The platinum is substantially uniformly distributed on the spinel containing particles. EXAMPLE III Example I was repeated except that the calcined magnesium aluminate spinel was impregnated with cerium. For cerium impregnation, 0.39 lb. cerium carbonate was slurried in 1820 mls. of water and mixed with 350 mls.of 70 nitric acid slowly to dissolve the carbonate. 3.75 libs. of the calcined magnesium aluminate spinel was placed in a Pyrex tray and impregnated with the cerium solution with hand mixing using rubber gloves. After the impregnation was complete, the mix was allowed to equilibrate overnight. The impregnated product was dried under IR lamps and finally in a 2600F. oven overnight. The dried product was calcined in a fluidized state in a 59 mm. diameter quartz reactor, for 3 hours at 9000F. with an air flow rate of about 83 l hr. The resulting magnesium aluminate spinel particles were screened to produce final particles having diameters less than 100 microns and these final particles contained 5 by weight of cerium, calculated as elemental cerium. EXAMPLE Iv A quantity of solid particles of a commercially available hydrocarbon cracking catalyst containing about 6 by weight of crystalline aluminosilicate, about 54 by weight amorphous silica alumina and 40 by weight alpha alumina, and having the same approximate size as the final particles from Example I, is combined with the final particles of Example I so that a mixture of 5 parts by weight of discrete entities and 95 parts by weight of the solid particles results. The catalytic activity of the solid particles is euilibrated by using same prior to combining with the discrete entities in commercial fluid bed catalytic cracking service. The mixture of solid particles and final particles is loaded to a conventional fluid bed catalytic cracking uit FvCU and used to crack a petroleum derived gas oil fraction, a combined fresh feed and recycle stream. The fresh gas oil fraction boils in the range of about 4000F.to about 1000 F. and is substantially hydrocarbon in nature, containing minor amounts of sulfur and nitrogen as contaminants.Conventional hydrocarbon cracking and catalyst regeneration conditions are employed in the reaction zone and regeneration zone, resectlvy. The weight ratio of catalyst particles to total fresh plus recycle hydrocarbon feed entering the reaction zone is about 6 to 1. Other conditions within the reaction zone include Temperature, 0r. 930 Pressure, psia. 15 WHSV is Such conditions result in about 70 by volume conversion of the gas oil feedstock to products boiling at 4000F. and below. The catalyst particles from the reaction zone include about 0.89 by weight of carbonaceous deposit material which is at least partially combusted in the regeneration zone. This carbonaceous material also includes a minor amount of sulfur which forms SO2 at the combustion conditions formed in the regeneration zone. Air, in an amount so that amount of oxygen in the regeneration zone is about 1.15 times the amount theoretically required to completely cc. bust this deposit material, is heated to the desired terperature before being admitted to the regeneration zone. Conditions within the regeneration zone include Temperature, DF. 1100 Pressure, psia. 15 Average Catalyst Residence Time, min. 30 After a period of time, the catalyst is shown to remain effective to promote hydrocarbon cracking in the reaction zone, and reduced emiss ions of sulfur as sulfur oxides from the flue gases of the regeneration zone are obtained relative to processing in the absence ot the final magnesium aluminate spinel containing particles. EXAMPLE V Example IV is repeated, except that the platinumcontaining particles of Example IT are used instead of the magnesium aluminate spinel particles of Example I.After a period of time, the catalyst is shown to remain effective to promote hydrocarbon cracking in the reaction zone and carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide oxidation in the regeneration zone. In addition, reduced emissions of sulfur as sulfur oxides from the flue gases of the regeneration zone are obtained relative to processing in the substantial absence of the platinum containing particles . EXAMPLE VI Example IV is repeated except that the ceriumcontaining particles of Example III are used in place of the particles of Example I. After a period of time, the catalyst is shown to remain effective to promote hydrocarbon cracking in the reaction zone, and reduced emissions of sulfur as sulfur oxides from the flue gases of the regeneration zone are obtained relative to processing in the absence of the final magnesium aluminate spinel containing particles. EXAMPLE VII Examples I, II and III are repeated, except that the final magnesium aluminate spinel particles, the platinumcontaining particles and the cerium containing particles, respectively, each include about 7 by weight of a crystal line aluminosilicate known to be catalytically active to promote hydrocarbon cracking. The crystalline aluminosili cate is incorporated into the particles using conventional, well known techniques.The platinum, and particularly the cerium, components are included in the particles so that a substantial amount, e.g., greater than about 50 , of the platinum and cerium is associated with the magnesium aluminate spinel of the particles, rather than with the crystalline aluminosilicate. Cerium associated with the crystalline aluminosilicate is substantially less effective, e.g., in reducing SOx emissions, relative to cerium deposited on the magnesium aluminate spinel portion of the particles. EXAMPLE VIII Example IV is repeated three times except that the magnesium aluminate containing spinel particles produced inExample VII are used in place of the particles of Example I.After a period of time in hydrocarbon cracking service, these catalyst mixtures are shown to be effective to promote hydrocarbon cracking and reduced sulfur emissions from the regeneration zone are obtained. In particular, it is found that the crystalline aluminosilicate present in the discrete entities improves the hydrocarbon cracking in the reaction zone beyond that occurring in a system with discrete entities containing substantially no zeolitic component. EXAMPLE IX A mass of combined particles is prepared as follows The magnesium aluminate spinel based discrete entities are prepared by forming an aqueous slurry of magnesium aluminate spinel precursor produced as in Example I so that the spinel concentration, calculated as MgA1204, is about 9 by weight. Sufficient crystalline aluminosilicate known to be effective to promote hydrocarbon cracking is added to the slurry so that the final magnesium aluminate spinel based discrete entities contain, on a dry weight basis, about 10 of such crystalline aluminosilicate. This slurry is stirred for about 1 hour to insure uniformity and then spray dried at a temperature less than that required to eliminate a substantial portion of the water of hydration to form discrete entities.These discrete entities are calcined in an electric muffle furnace using a programmed timer to increase the temperature 3000F. per hour to 10500F. and maintain this temperature for 3 hours. The discrete entities are impregnated with platinum and cerium as in Examples II and III. The final discrete entities contain about 7 by weight of cerium calculated as elemental cerium, and about 100 ppm. by weight of platinum.A major portion of the cerium and platinum is associated with the spinel, rather than the crystalline aluminosilicate. Essentially all the calcined discrete entities have a maximum dimension of less than about 200 microns.The discrete entities larger than 60 microns are discarded. The solid particles binder material is prepared by adding 6000 parts by weight of a solution containing PhiladelphiaQuartz Company E brand sodium silicate solution diluted with an equal weight of water to 3000 parts by weight of dilute density l.234 H2SO4. After these two solutions are thoroughly mixed, 4000 parts by weight of a solution containing 1200 parts by weight of A1215O4 3 18H2O is added.Sufficient crystalline aluminosilicate, known to be effective to promote hydrocarbon cracking, is added to the mixture so that the final solid particles binder material contains, on a dry weight basis, about 10 of such crystalline aluminosilicate. The resulting mixture is let stand to gel.The resulting hydrogel is cut into about 3 4 cubes and covered with concentrated NO4 OOH diluted with an equal volume of water.This material is let stand overnight and has a final pH of 11. The material is then washed by percolation until free of Na and SO4 ion. 500 parts on a dry weight basis of the washed hydrogel and 80 parts on a dry weight basis of the remaining calcined discrete entities and 10,000 parts by weight of water are thoroughly mulled, ground and mixed with agitation.The resulting slurry is dried in a spray drier. This drier is equipped with a two fluid nozzle system which uses air at about 20 psig.to disperse the slurry into the drying chamber.The drying gas, i.e., flue gas from an inline burner, enters the drying chamber at about 7500F. and exits the chamber at a temperature which ranges from about 305 F. to 3150F. This drying gas in introduced into the top of the drying chamber while the slurry is dispersed upward from near the bottom of the chamber. In this way, the material to be dried is exposed to both counter current flow during assent from the nozzle system and co current flow during gravity dissent relative to the downward drying gas flow. The resulting dried particles are calcined in a manner similar to the calcination of the spinel based discrete entities described above. The resulting combined particles are screened to provide particles properly sized for use in a fluidized catalytic bed reaction zone regenerator hydrocarbon cracking system. EXAMPLE X Example IV is repeated except that the physical mixture of discrete entities and catalyst particles used in Example IV are replaced by the combined particles produced in Example. After a period of time, these combined particles are shown to remain effective to promote both hydrocarbon cracking in the reaction zone and to reduce the amount of sulfur atmospheric emissions in the regeneration zone flue gases. EXAMPLE XI Example I is repeated except that Li NO3 3H2O is substituted for the Mg NO3 2 6H2O. The resulting final lithium aluminate spinel particles have diameters less than 100 microns. EXAMPLE XII The final particles of Example XI are impregnated, using conventional techniques with chloroplatinic acid. The resulting spinel containing particles are dried and calcined and contain about 100 ppm. of platinum, by weight of the total platinum containing particles, calculated as elemental platinum. The platinum is substantially uniformly distributed on the spinel containing particles. EXAMPLE XIII The final particles of Example XI are impregnated, using conventional techniques, with cerium using as aqueous cerium nitrate solution. The resulting spinel containing particles are dried and calcined and contain about 10 weight of cerium, calculated as elemental cerium. EXAMPLES XIV to XVI Example IV is repeated three times except that the final particles of Example I are replaced by the resulting spinel containing particles of Examples XI, XII and XIII, respectively. In each instance, reduced emissions of sulfur as sulfur oxides from the flue gases of the regenerator zone is obtained. EXAMPLES XVII to XXI Particles having diameters of less than 100 microns of the following spinel materials are prepared using conventional techniques Example Spinel XVII Fez1204 XVIII MnA12O4 XIX MgCr2O4 XX 2TiO4 XXI NgFe2O4 EXAMPLES XXII to XXVI Example IV is repeated five additional times except that the final particles of Example I are replaced by the spinel containing particles of Examples XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX and XXI, respectively. In each instance, reduced emissions of sulfur as sulfur oxides from the flue gases of the regenerator zone is obtained. EXAMPLES XXVII AND XXVIII These examples illustrate certain of the surprising benefits of the present invention. Two blends of particles were prepared for testing.The blends were as follows Blend A 5 by weight cerium impregnated magnesium aluminate spinel final particles pro duced as in Example I, plus 95 by weight of a conventional zeolite containing hydrocarbon cracking catalyst which had been equilibrated in commercial fluid bed catalytic cracking service. o Blend B 5 by weight cerium impregnated gamma alumina particles containing 5 by weight of cerium, calculated as elemental cerium, and having a particle size in the range of 25 to 100 microns, plus 95 by weight of the same conventional zeolite containing catalyst as to prepare blend A. Cerium alumina particles are known to possess good initial sulfur oxide removal activity when used in fluid catalytic cracking service. Both blends were tested to determine their ability to continue to remove sulfur oxides over a period of time.This test procedure was as follows Step 1 involved an initial determination of the ability of the blend to remove sulfur oxides from regenerator flue gases. Step one was carried out in a fluid bed catalytic cracking pilot plant known to provide results which are correlatable to results obtained in commercial sized systems. The feedstock and conditions for step 1 were as follows Feedstock mid continent gas oil containing 2.0 by weight sulfur o Reactor temperature 9300F. o Regenerator temperature 11000 F. o Stripper temperature 930 F. o Pressure 15 psia. o Approximate catalyst regeneration time 30 minutes Approximate stripping time 10 minutes o Approximate reaction time lminute o Steam as inerts in reactor, 3 mole . Step 2 of the test procedure involved continuous and accelerated aging in a fluidized bed reactor to simulate the type of aqinq which occurs in commercial fluid bed catalytic cracking service. The feedstock and conditions utilized in step 2 were as follows Feedstock Gulf Coast gas oil containing 2.0 by weight sulfur o Reactor temperature 930 F. Reactor pressure 15 psia. o Reaction residence time I minute o Reaction catalyst oil weight ratio 6 o Stripping temperature 9300F. o Regenerator temperature 11000F. o Regenerator pressure 15 psia. o Catalyst regenerator residence time 30 o Regenerator combustion air flow ratio 20 lbs.air lb.coke Step 3 of the test procedure involved periodically repeating step 1 to determine how much of the blend s activity to remove sulfur oxide had been lost during the aging of step 2. The amount of sulfur oxides emitted with the flue gases from the regeneration using the blend was used as the basis for determining the blend s ability or activity to remove such sulfur oxides. Results of testing Blends A and B following the above procedures were as follows Days Aged at Conditions 11 4 of Initial Activity to Remove of Step 2 Sulfur Oxide Retained Blend A Blend B 0 100 100 2 93 43 4 89 18 6 81 8 ozone On day of aging at the condition of step 2 is more severe than the aging which would occur in commercial FCC service. Therefore, there is no direct one on one correlation between aging in these two aging mcdes. These results indicate very clearly that the ceriummagnesium aluminate spinel particles of Blend A maintain sulfur oxide removal activity much longer than the ccium alumina particles of Blend B. Relatively rapid loss of sulfur removal activity has been one of the major problems with prior art attempts, e.g., cerium on alumina particles, to reduce sulfur oxide emissions. Therefore, these results show that the present invention provides substantial and surprising advantages in reducing sulfur oxide emissions from combustion zones, e.g., regeneration zones of fluid bed hydrocarbon catalytic cracking units. While this invention has been described with respect to various specific examples and embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto and that it can be variously practiced within the scope of the following claims.
