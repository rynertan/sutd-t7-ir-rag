# BRUSHING DEVICE

## Abstract
A brushing device, for a rotating brushing machine or similar surface treating apparatus, is axially formed from a plurality of sections 1, 5, 10 with relatively long bristles and other sections 2, 6, 7, 11, 12 with relatively short bristles and or without bristles. The sections with relatively long bristles are always separated from each other by sections with relatively short bristles andor sections without bristles. The device is suitable for brushing carcasses continuously conveyed on a slaughter line. The carcasses will assume specific positions during conveyance past the device, in which positions the entire treated rind surface is cleaned by the brushing device, because the length of the bristles is adapted to the contour of the carcass in the brushed area.
