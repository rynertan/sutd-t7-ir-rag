# Process for the production of modified polyesters.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for producing polyesters and co polyesters modified with certain polyoxyalkylene glycols using coordination complex catalysts of I a metal halide compound and certain silicon compounds or II a mixture of said coordination complex catalyst of said compounds with antimony diglycollate. There are also disclosed polyoxyalkylene glycol modified polyesters produced by such process.
