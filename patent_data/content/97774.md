# TRANSDUCING SYSTEM

## Abstract
The surface of a magnetic recording disk M is encoded with optically sensed indicia OT , which is employed to control track following of a read write slider 17 carrying a magnetic head 19 along a magnetic recording track MT . The optical reader is a laser 21 carried by the slider which co operates with the disk as a reflector which completes the lasing function or modulates the operating characteristic of the laser. The retro reflected light changes the operating voltage of the laser diode. The disk is coated with a multiple layer optical recording medium deposited upon the upper surface of a magnetic recording layer.
