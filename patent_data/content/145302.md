# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SEVERING THIN STRIP MATERIAL

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are provided for severing a moving thin strip material 20 across the width of the strip by providing a thin rigid cutting element 14 and urging the cutting element 14 to move rapidly across the path of travel of the strip material 20 in a plane transverse to the plane of the strip material 20 . The strip material 20 is contacted about one side edge 22 and the cutting wire 14 continues to rapidly move across the strip width from a first edge 22 to a second edge 24 to sever the moving strip 20 . The method and apparatus are useful for severing strip material 20 being produced at up to 4000 feet 1219 meters per minute and is not dependent upon the guage or ductility of the material.
