## Description
GRIGNARD SYNTHESES This invention relates to the preparation by Grignard syntheses of certain substituted tetrafluorobenzene and tetrafluoropyridine compounds which are useful chemical intermediates in the synthesis of pesticidal compounds. More particularly, it relates to a process for preparing 1,2,4,5 tetrafluoro 3 cyano 6 hydrocarbylbenzenes from tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile and 2,3,5,6 tetrafluoro 4 hydrocarbylpyridines from the corresponding 4 cyanopyridine. It also relates to the transformation of the 1,2,4,5 tetrafluoro 3 cyano 6 hydrocarbyl benzenes into Grignard compounds, the use of the Grignard compounds to prepare various 3 substituted 1,2,4,5 tetrafluoro 6 hydrocarbylbenzenes, and the Grignard compounds themselves. In one aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I EMI1.1 in which A is C CN or N, R is alkyl, particularly C1 4 alkyl, especially methyl and ethyl, aralkyl, especially benzyl or substituted benzyl, C3 or more alkenyl whose double bond is not attached to the carbon atom linked to the benzene or pyridine ring, especially allyl and 3 butenyl, or alkynyl,which comprises treating a compound of the formula II EMI2.1 in which A has the meaning already given, with a Grignard reagent, RMgX, in which X is halo, under conditions suitable for the conduct of aGrignard reaction. Conveniently, the Grignard reagent prepared in ethereal medium is added with stirring to compound II, also in ethereal medium, or vice versa. Reaction will usually take place in a temperature range of from 50 C to 1OO0C, preferably 250C to 300and, more preferably, 250C to 0 C. Typically, one ingredient is added to the other with stirring over a few hours and the reaction mixture allowed to stand for several minutes before the product is isolated. It may, however, be desirable to heat the reaction mixture after or during addition of the ingredients for example, the mixture may be heated under reflux which, if tetrahydrofuran is the ether used, will be at a temperature of about 65aC. Generally, the conditions of reaction will be those well known to be suitable for the conduct of Grignard reactions, it being important to exclude water. It has been found advantageous, with regard to increased yields and reduced usage of Grignard reagent, to have present a quaternary ammonium salt, in particular, tetrabutylammonium bromide. To isolate the product, the reaction mixture is cooled, if necessary, poured into water or over ice, acidified and the compound I extracted with, for example, methylene chloride. Approximately 1 to 2 mols, typically about 1.5 mols, ofGrignard reagent will normally be used for each mol of compound II . When compound II is tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile, higher amounts ofGrignard reagent transform compound II , as will be described later, into a Grignard compound which will be decomposed during isolation of compound I in the aqueous medium. The Grignard reagent, RMgX, may be prepared by methods well known for the preparation of Grignard compounds. X may be chloro, bromo or iodo. Tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile is a known compound which may be obtained by fluorinating the corresponding tetrachlorinated compound with potassium fluoride in a polar aprotic solvent. The tetrachlorinated compound may be prepared from commercially available tetrachloroterephthaloyl chloride by treatment with aqueous ammonia to form the diamide which can be dehydrated with phosphorus oxychloride. 2,3,5,6 Tetrafluoro 4 cyanopyridine is also a known compound C.A. Registry No.16297 07 7 which may be obtained from pentafluoropyridine J.Fluorine Chem. 1973 3 3 4 , 275 83 CA 80 59813X . In another aspect of the invention, the compound of formula I , in which A is C CN, is treated with a Grignard reagent, 1 1 in which 1 and 1R MgXÚ , in which R1 and X1 have the meanings hereinbefore defined for R and X, respectively, under conditions suitable for the conduct of aGrignard reaction, to form a Grignard compound of formula III EMI4.1 in which Q is CN or X1. The invention also includes the novel Grignard compound of formula III . Q is cyano or halo. The Grignard reagent R 9 may be the same as or different from the Grignard reagent of RMgX used to prepare the compound of formula I . As R1 does not form part of the Grignard compound of formula III , it may be chosen for reasons of cheapness and convenience. It is, however, possible to form the Grignard compound of formula III from tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile by reaction with normally more than 2 mols, for example, 3 mols mol of the terephthalonitrile in a single stage process, i.e. without isolation of the intermediate nitrile, in which case the Grignard reagents RMgX and R i 1 will be the same. This single stage process forms yet another aspect of the present invention. The Grignard compound of formula III may be used as a typicalGrignard reagent in any of the reactions known to transform a Grignard compound, ArMgXê , in which Ar is aryl and X2 is halo, into a compound ofAr Rê , in which Rê is defined later. Its use as such forms still yet a further aspect of this invention. Thus, the Grignard compound of formula III may be used to prepare compounds of the formula IV EMI5.1 in which R has the meaning hereinbefore defined, and R2 is hydrogen, alkyl, particularly C1 4 alkyl, especially methyl, alkenyl especially allyl, hydroxy, carboxy, a carboxylic ester, formyl, hydroxyalkyl especially hydroxyethyl, alkoxyalkyl, especially alkoxymethyl, alkylcarbonyl, orEMI5.2 R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, being hydrogen or alkyl, particularly C1 4 alkyl. The table below illustrates with what substances the Grignard compound III may be reacted, under well known reaction conditions, to obtain the proposed values of R2.

Conveniently, compound V may be prepared from tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile by a single stage process, in which tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile is reacted with more than 2 mols mol, for example 3 mols mol, of a Grignard reagent RMgX under conditions suitable for the conduct of Grignard reactions and contacting the reaction product thereby obtained with water to give compound V in which R5 isH or with an alkylating agent to give compound V in which R5 is C1 4 alkyl. Other compounds of formula IV may similarly be prepared by single stage processes and such processes form still yet a further aspect of the present invention. The compounds I , III , IV and V find use, for example, as chemical intermediates in the synthesis of pesticidal compounds. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples 1 to 12 in which percentages are by weight.Example 1Preparation of 1 cyano 4 ethyl 2 ,3 ,5 , 6 tetrafluorobenzene Tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile 0.01 mol in tetrahydrofuran 10 ml was added with stirring to ethylmagnesium bromide 0.01 mol in tetrahydrofuran 10 ml at 200C. The resulting mixture, which rapidly darkened, was stirred and heated under reflux for 4 hours and then allowed to cool to 20 C. The cooled mixture was poured over ice, acidified and extracted with methylene chloride. Gic E301 1500 mass spectrometry showed the presence of unreacted tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile ca. 65 together with 1 cyano 4 ethyl 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene ca. 35 m e 188,203. Traces only of dicyanoethyltrifluorobenzene, a cyanodiethyltrifluorobenzene and a tetraethyldifluorobenzene were detected. Example 2Preparation of 1 ethyl 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene Tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile 0.01 mol in tetrahydrofuran 10 ml was added with stirring to ethylmagnesium bromide 0.03 mol in tetrahydrofuran 20 ml . The resulting mixture was stirred and heated under ref lug for 4 hours and then cooled to ambient temperature. The cooled mixture was poured over ice, acidifed and extracted with methylene chloride. Glc E301 1350 mass spectrometry showed that all but a trace of tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile had been consumed. One glc peak predominated which can be attributed to 1 ethyl 2,3,5,6tetrafluorobenzene m e 178,163. This product indicates that, before hydrolysis, the reaction mixture contained 4 ethyl 2,3,5,6tetrafluorophenyl magnesium cyanide or bromide, probably, initially, the cyanide.Example 3Preparation of 1, 4 dimethyl 2 3,5, 6 tetrafluorobenzene Methylbromide 5.7g, 0.06 mol in tetrahydrofuran 20 ml was added dropwise, under a C02 condenser, to magnesium 1.46g, 0.06 mol in tetrahydrofuran 40 ml stirred in the presence of a little iodine.There was a mild exotherm. The mixture was stirred for half an hour when nearly all the magnesium was consumed. The mixture was cooled to 100C and tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile 4.0g, 0.02 mol suspended in tetrahydrofuran 20 ml was added in portions while the temperature of the mixture which was a dark blue green suspension, was kept at 10 C. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and then added to dimethyl sulphate 30 ml and left over a weekend. The mixture was poured into water, acidified, extracted into methylene chloride and examined by glc E301 . A peak having the same retention time as an authentic sample of 1,4 dimethyl 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene was present.This structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry glc m e 178, 177, 163. The yield of 1,4 dimethyl 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene was 0.0024 mol 12 .Example 4 A slurry of tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile clog 0.5 mol in tetrahydrofuran 21 was stirred and cooled to 200C. A solution of methylmagnesium bromide in tetrahydrofuran 260g ca. 0.5 mol was added at 200C over 30 minutes. Analysis of a sample by glc showed the presence of 1 cyano 4 methyl 2, 3,5, 6 tetrafluorobenzene and tetrafluoroterephthalonitrila in the ratio of 4 3. Two more lots of methylmagnesium bromide solution were added each 130g ca. 0.25 mol . Analysis showed that the 2 mols approximately of methylmagnesium bromide added was sufficient to consume nearly all the starting material.. Water 200ml was added and the temperature of the reaction mixture allowed to rise to ambient. The mixture was rotary evaporated under reduced pressure to remove most of the tetrahydrofuran, treated with 4N HC1 and extracted into methylene dichloride total 950ml .Analysis by glc indicated that, on the assumption that all glc peaks derived from compounds having the same glc responses per mol as tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile, the mixture contained 1 cyano 4 methyl2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene 0.2455 mol, 49 yield and 1,4 dicyano 2methyltrifluorobenzene 0.0435 mol, 9 yield . No significant amount of starting material remained. The methylene dichloride solution was rotary evaporated to leave a residue 89.7g which was then distilled under reduced pressure water pump at 100 to 1050C. The distillate 43.7g was shown by glc analysis to consist of 86 1 cyano 4 methyl 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene 37.6g, 0.2 mol, 40 yield and 11 of 1,4 dicyano 2 methyltrifluorobenzene. More material distilled over after the still head temperature reached 105 C . A compound 28.7g , confirmed by nmr analysis to be 1 cyano 4 methyl 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene 98 strength by glc , crystallised from the distillate on standing over a weekend.Analysis by glc showed the mother liquor to contain 80.8 1 cyano 4 methyl 2,3 ,5 , 6 tetrafluorobenzene m e 188 189, 170, 139 and 15.9 of 1,4 dicyano 2 methyltrifluorobenzene m e 196, 195, 169 .Example 5Preparation of 1 allyL 4 cyano 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene Allylmagnesium chloride Grignard reagent A small amount of neat allyl chloride about g was added to a mixture of magnesium 14.6g , a crystal of iodine and tetrahydrofuran 60ml stirred under an atmosphere of nitrogen, when reaction was rapidly initiated. Allyl chloride 31.6g in tetrahydrofuran 80ml was then added at 1O0C over 3 hours. The resulting allylmagnesium chloride was allowed to stand and assayed by both propylene evolution and by addition to an excess of 1N HC1 and back titration with 1N NaOH. Allylmagnesium chloride lOm.mol , prepared as described above, was added during 3 hours to tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile lug, 5m.mol in tetrahydrofuran 70ml at 500C. A blue colour formed early during the addition but, after work up in a manner similar to that described inExample 1 aqueous dilution acidification solvent extraction , samples for analysis were almost colourless. Essentially all of theGrignard reagent was consumed no gas evolution during work up as was about 70 of the starting material. Little l cyano 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene was present. About 5 yield of a volatile component was detected. The addition of more Grignard reagent degraded the remaining dinitrile, but no more of the volatile component was formed. Analysis by glc mass spectroscopy showed the volatile component to have the formulaEMI11.1 m e 215, 188, 196Preparation of 1 cyano 4 methyltetrafluorobenzene with and without tetrabutylammonium bromide presentExample 6 At 20 C a A solution of methylmagnesium bromide in tetrahydrofuran 16m.mol, 12g diluted to 25ml was added dropwise over 5 hours to tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile 2g, 10m.mol stirred in tetrahydrofuran 20ml at 20 C. The reaction mixture was left for 20 minutes after the Grignard reagent addition and then water added methane evolution was measured followed by 4N H2S04. The products were extracted into toluene and analysed by glc. Results are given in Table 1. b The procedure of Example 6 a was repeated except that tetrabutyl ammonium bromide Ig was added to the tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile tetrahydrofuran mixture. This gave a yellow solution at 25 C and a white precipitate on cooling. On work up more resin was apparent than in most other reactions at 2O0C. Results are given in Table 1. Unreacted methylmagnesium bromide was assayed by methane evolution, being 4.9 m.mol in 6 a and 6m.mol in 6 b . Thus, in 6 b , only 10m.mol of Grignard reagent was consumed.

Example7 At 270C a A solution of methylmagnesium bromide in tetrahydrofuran 16m.mol, 25ml was added over 3 hours to tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile 2g, lOm.mol in tetrahydrofuran 20ml at 27 C. Water was added to the purple reaction mixture about 20 minutes after completion of theGrignard addition. No methane was evolved. The mixture was acidified and the products extracted with toluene. Glc analysis of resulting highly coloured solution showed that all the tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile had been consumed. Results are given in Table 2. b The procedure of Example 7 a was repeated except that tetrabutylammonium bromide lug was added to the tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile tetrahydrofuran mixture giving a yellow solution.The reaction mixture after the Grignard addition was dark blue.Similar observations were made with respect to methane evolution and consumption of the dinitrile starting material. Results are given in Table 2.

Example 8Preparation of 1 3 butenyl 4 cyano 2 ,3,5, 6 tetrafluorobenzene 3 butenylmagnesium bromide Grignard reagent 3 Butenyl bromide 13.2g, lOml, O.lmol in tetrahydrofuran 20ml was added to magnesium 3g and a crystal of iodine in tetrahydrofuran 20ml . Initiation of reaction was indicated by a rapid exotherm. The reaction mixture was diluted to 80ml. Part of the Grignard reagent prepared as above 60ml equivalent to 0.75mol of 3 butenyl bromide was sufficient to consume 8.5g 0.0425mol of tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile at 200C in tetrahydrofuran. No significant quantities of gas were evolved on aqueous work up. The organic products were extracted into toluene and the solution rotary evaporated to leave 11.55g of residue. Of this, 10.6g was fractionally distilled under vacuum 20mm to give a control portion 7.5g which had a major component 73 identified by glc mass spectroscopy as H2C CHCH2CH C F CN I , and a minor component 10 thought to be H2C CHCH2CH2C 6F3 CN 2. The yield of I was about 60 based on the dinitrile starting material.
