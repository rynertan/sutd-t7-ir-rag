# Method of cooling hot synthesis gas and synthesis gas cooler.

## Abstract
Hot synthesis gas is cooled and deashed in a quench portion of a synthesis gas generator. In said quench portion product gas is passed downwardly through a first contacting zone in contact with a downwardly descending film of cooling liquid, then preferably at a decreasing velocity through an expanded second contacting zone, and then through a body of aqueous cooling liquid in a third contacting zone, prefer ably followed by a baffled vapor liquid disengaging zone prior to withdrawal of product gas from said generator.
