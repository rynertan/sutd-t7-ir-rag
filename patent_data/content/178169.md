## Description
This invention relates to a sliding member made of a sintered ceramic material consisting preponderantly of silicon nitride Si₃N₄ and exhibiting excellence in mechanical strength, resistance to thermal shock, and resistance to corrosion at elevated temperatures. It is long since a proposal was made to use a sintered ceramic material exhibiting excellent mechanical properties at elevated temperatures in bearings destined to serve in atmospheres of elevated temperatures. The conventional sintered ceramic material, however, has the disadvantage that the bearings made of such material, when used in liquids such as fused metals which are held at elevated temperatures and are highly corrosive, are deficient in mechanical strength, resistance to thermal shock, and resistance to corrosion and undergo breakage early. Silicon nitride type sintered ceramic materials have found popular recognition as sintered ceramic materials of large mechanical strength. Unfortunately, the silicon nitride type sintered ceramic materials produced by the metal silicon nitriding method, the imide method, etc. and offered generally in the market fail to satisfy the levels of mechanical strength, resistance to thermal shock, and resistance to corrosion which sliding members destined to serve in atmospheres of elevated temperatures. The abstract of JP A 8027843 discloses the production of a sintered silicon nitride article by mixing silicon dioxide powder with an excess of carbon powder and a small amount of a reactive catalyst silicon powder, silicon nitride powder as silicon carbide powder thermally reducing the mixture under nitrogen at 1450 C i.e. producing silicon nitride by a silica reducing method with a reaction catalyst, e. g. as described in EP A 0080050 and sintering a blend of the resultant silicon nitride with yttrium oxide and aluminium oxide at 1750 C. There is no suggestion in JP A 8027843 that the carbon content of the silicon nitride powder is of any importance. The inventors continued a diligent study directed to the elimination of the drawbacks suffered by the conventional sintered ceramic materials as described above. They have, consequently, found that the sliding members produced by using silicon nitride powder obtained by the silica reduction method offer satisfactory serviceability for an amply long period even in highly corrosive liquids under harsh thermal conditions. This invention, therefore, aims to provide as set forth in claim 1 a method for the production of sliding members made preponderantly of a sintered ceramic material exhibiting excellence in mechanical stregnth, resistance to thermal shock, and resistance to corrosion at elevated temperatures The drawing is a partially cutaway perspective view illustrating a bearing, made according to this invention. The sliding members of the present invention are sintered ceramic pieces produced by moulding in prescribed shapes the silicon nitride powder obtained by the silica reduction method and firing the moulded masses of silicon nitride powder. The silicon nitride powder to be used in this invention is manufactured by the silica reduction method to be described below. Specifically, the silica reduction method comprises mixing silicon dioxide powder and carbon powder in an excess amount relative to the reaction equivalent weight thereof preferably such that the C SiO₂ ratio will fall in the range of 0.4 to 4 in conjunction with a small amount of a reaction catalyst selected from among silicon powder, silicon nitride powder, and carbide powder and firing the resultant mixture in an atmosphere of nitrogen at a temperature in the range of 1,350 C to 1,600 C preferably 1,400 C to 1,500 C . In this method, silicon nitride powder containing carbon powder is obtained in consequence of the reaction shown by the following formula. 3SiO₂ C excess 2N 2 Si₃ N₄ small amount Si₃ N4 3CO 2 C about 5 to 15 by weight Generally, as the starting components for the aforementioned reaction, 60 to 70 by weight of SiO₂ and 25 to 35 by weight of carbon powder are used as additionally mixed with 2 to 10 by weight of Si₃N₄ powder. If the reaction temperature is lower than 1,350 C, the reaction velocity is low and the yield is insufficient. If it exceeds 1,600 C, the reaction entails formation of SiC. Thus, any deviation from the aforementioned temperature range is undesirable. Adjustment of the amount of carbon powder remaining during the course of firing can be easily effected by adjusting the firing time. The silicon nitride powder produced by the silica reduction method and used in the present invention has a carbon content in the range of 0. 1 to 3 by weight. The silicon nitride powder obtained as described above is such that α type silicon nitride accounts for at least 95 , whereas the silicon nitride powder obtained by the conventional method consists of about 90 of α type silicon nitride and the balance of β type silicon nitride. The silicon nitride powder as also characterized by having an average particle diameter less than 1 µm, whereas the silicon nitride powder obtained by the conventional method has an average particle diameter more than 1 µm. This silicon nitride powder is commingled, caused to contain as sintering aid, 0.5 to 10 by weight of yttrium oxide Y₂O₃ and 0.1 to 10 by weight of aluminum oxide Al₂O₃ , and further mixed with an organic binder. The resultant mixture is moulded in a prescribed shape, and fired at a temperature in the range of 1,600 C to 1,800 C. The moulding may be made in a complete shape which a final product is expected to assume. Otherwise, it may be moulded in the shape of a simple raw material such as a plate or round bar suitable for yielding a final product by machining. Then, the moulded mass is fired and the cut in the final shape by machining. The firing may be carried out in an inert atmosphere under atmospheric pressure, The method which fires the moulded mass in a nitrogen containing inert atmosphere under pressure of 1.5 to 50 kg cm² or the method which sinters the moulded mass with a hot press, however, proves advantageous. Optionally, the characteristic properties of the sintered mass obtained by the method described above can be further improved by placing the sintered mass in an alumina container and heating it at a temperature of about 1,700 C in an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen compressed to the level of about 1,000 atmospheres thereby decreasing the spaces between the silica nitride particles. The sliding member formed in a prescribed shape by machining is enabled to acquire improvement in mechanical strength, resistance to thermal shock, resistance to corrosion, etc. by being subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature of 800 C to 1,200 C preferably 900 C to 1,100 C in an oxidative atmosphere for one to 100 hours preferably 2 to 50 hours . The sliding members made according to this invention is particularly suitable for use in a bearing. When it is used in a bearing, this bearing may be wholly formed of sintered ceramic material. Optionally, only the balls or the rollers serving as rotating members in the bearing may be formed of sintered ceramic material. When the rotating members of the bearing are formed of sintered ceramic material as described above, they are less susceptible to the effect of centrifugal force because the sintered ceramic material is light. Thus, the properties of the rotating members during a high speed rotation are improved. Example 1 A mixture was obtained by using 63 by weight of silicon dioxide powder having an average particle diameter of about 0.05 µm, 31 by weight of carbon powder having an average particle diameter of 0.03 µm, and 6 by weight of silicon nitride α type Si₃N₄ having an average particle diameter of about 0.8 µm was heated under a flow of nitrogen gas at about 1,500 C for about three hours, to effect reduction of the silicon dioxide powder. The product of this reduction was silicon nitride powder α type content more than 95 having an average particle diameter of about 0.8 µm and containing carbon powder. The carbon powder content in the mixture was about 10 by weight. This mixture was heated in an oxygen containing atmosphere at about 700 C for one hour to adjust the carbon content to 1.75 by weight. Then, the powder was combined with ytrrium oxide, aluminum oxide, and aluminum nitride in such proper proportions that the resultant mixture consisted of 91 by weight of silicon nitride, 5 by weight of yttrium oxide, 2 by weight of aluminum oxide, and 2 by weight of aluminum nitride. The mixture was thoroughly blended, then caused to contain therein paraffin as a caking agent, and moulded in a metal die under pressure of about 400 kg cm² to produce a plate 40 x 40 x 8 mm. This plate was calcined in nitrogen gas at about 1,550 C for about one hour and thereafter sintered in nitrogen gas at about 1,750 C for about two hours. The sintered ceramic plate consequently obtained possessed apparent specific gravity of at least 3 2 and hardness Hv of not less than 1,800. The sintered silicon nitride plate was cut into square bars 3 x 3 x 35 mm and tested for breaking strength under the conditions of 0.5 mm min. of crosshead speed, 20 mm of span, and a varying temperature of normal room temperature, 1,000 C or 1,200 C. The results breaking strength in kg mm² were as follows. A bearing was produced by assembling rotating members, an inner race, an outer race, and a retainer all obtained by cutting the sintered silicon nitride material by machining. In the diagram, 1 stands for the inner race, 2 for the outer race, 3 for the rotating members, and 4 for the retainer. This bearing possessed outstanding mechanical strength even in liquid fused plating metal and exhibited excellent resistance to thermal shock and to corrosion. Example 2 The carbon powder containing silicon nitride powder obtained in Example 1 was thoroughly mixed with yttrium oxide, aluminum oxide, and aluminum nitride in proportions such that the resultant mixture consisted of 91 by weight of silicon nitride, 5 by weight of yttrium oxide, 2 by weight of aluminum oxide, and 2 by weight of aluminum nitride. The resultant mixture and parrafin added thereto as a caking agent were moulded in a metal die under pressure of about 300 kg cm² to produce a plate 40 x 40 x 8 mm. This plate was pressured under static pressure of about 1 ton cm² and then fired in nitrogen gas underf pressure of about 3 kg cm² at about 1,600 C for about two hours. A bearing was produced by assembling rotating members, an inner race, an outer race, and a retainer all obtained by cutting the resultant sintered silicon nitride material. This bearing possessed outstanding mechanical strength even in liquid fused plating metal and exhibited excellent resistance to thermal shock and to corrosion. Example 3 The carbon powder containing silica nitride powder obtained in Example 1 was thoroughly mixed with yttrium oxide and aluminum oxide in proportions such that the resultant mixture consisted of 93 by weight of silicon nitride, 500 by weight of yttrium oxide, and 2 by weight of aluminum oxide. The resultant mixture and paraffin added thereto as a caking agent were moulded in a metal die under pressure of about 300 kg cm 2 to produce a plate 40 x 40 x 8 mnm. This plate was pre sintered in nitrogen gas at about 1,750 C for about one hour and a half and then subjected to hot press sintering in a carbon container using aluminum nitride as a packing powder at about 1,750 C under pressure of about 500 kg cm² for about two hours. A bearing was produced by assembling rotating members, an inner race, an outer race, and a retainer all obtained by cutting the resultant sintered silicon nitride material. This bearing possessed outstanding mechanical strength even in liquid fused plating metal and exhibited excellent resistance to thermal shock and to corrosion. Example 4 The bearing obtained in Example 1 was subjected to a heat treatment in an oxidative atmosphere at about 1,000 C for 50 hours. In consequence of this heat treatment, the characteristic properties of this bearing were improved and the dispersion in the properties was reduced.
