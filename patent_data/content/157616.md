# CONTROL VALVE

## Abstract
A control valve is provided for controlling the distribution of pumped hydrodynamic fluid to the trailer brakes of a tractor and trailer combination under the influence of hydrostatic pres sure applied from the tractor braking system. The valve has an inlet 80 for pumped fluid, a spool valve 4 operable in re sponse to a control piston 15 to control the flow of pumped fluid to a first working circuit through an outlet 17 and to tank through an outlet 18 . A flow control valve 5 provides a pas sage communicating with a first flow path 22 for pumped fluid to the spool valve and is operable in response to pumped fluid pressure, to control the flow of pumped fluid to a second working circuit through an outlet 19 . A second flow path 6D, 27 for pumped fluid extends between the inlet 8 and spool valve 4 independent from and parallel with the first flow path 22 and the spool valve 4 controls the flow of pumped fluid along the second flow path to the fluid outlet 17 .
