# Coplanar antenna for proximate surveillance systems.

## Abstract
A coplanar antenna system has an interrogating means adapted to generate time varying magnetic field components within a region proximate thereto and a receiving means adapted to detect magnetic field components within a region proximate to the antenna system. The interrogating means has a plurality of coils 20 configured such that the components thereof have near zero net resultant magnetic field. At least one coil 30 of the receiving means is configured to detect components thereof having a pre selected net resultant magnetic field.
