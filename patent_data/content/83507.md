# FLUID OPERATED HAMMER HAVING DRILL BIT CLEARANCE MEANS

## Abstract
A fluid operated hammer comprising a cylindrical casing 11 having a bore for slidably receiving a piston 26 , a top sub 12 mounted at one end, a drill bit 13 mounted to the other end by means of a chuck 14 , a feed tube 20 concentrically mounted within the upper end of the bore of the casing and extending downwardly into the casing, said feed tube being connectible to a fluid source through said top sub. The piston is slidably mounted within the bore of said casing over said feed tube 20 . The feed tube 20 is provided with at least one aperture 24 in the walls of said feed tube, and at least one port 27, 29 provided at each end of the piston. Each port opens at spaced locations into the bore of the piston to periodically communicate with said aperture 24 as a result of sliding movement of the piston over the feed tube to alternately drive the piston towards and away from the drill bit to impact thereon and to drive the piston away from the drill bit. A further aperture 40 is provided in said feed tube 20 to communicate with the space between said drill bit 13 and said piston 26 when said hammer is in the blow down position. The drill bit 13 is mounted in the chuck 14 in such manner that when in the blow down position there is communication between said space and the exterior of the hammer through the zone between the drill bit and the chuck.
