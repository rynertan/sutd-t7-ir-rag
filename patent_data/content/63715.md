Description of the Prior Art Mechanisms which produce audible noise are often covered with a sound insulating plate in order to provide noise insulation In this case the plate is attached to the external surface of the mechanism so as to closely cover it. There are various sound insulating plates as described above, such as single layer or double layer type sound insulating plates. The prior art sound insulating plate of single layer type is formed of a piece of steel plate. The prior art sound insulating plate of double layer type is formed of a piece of steel plate and a layer of synthetic resin such as polyurethane. In prior art single or double layer type sound insulating plates, however, the sound insulation effect is equal to only the sum of each layer s sound insulation effect, with the result that the insulation effect is not sufficient in many actual cases. In order to increase the insulation effect, it is necessary to attach a heavy, high damping material such as rubber to the plate, or to increase the thickness of the plate. As a result, there exists a problem in that it is very troublesome to attach the high damping material to the plate and further the weight and thickness of the sound insulating plate inevitably increase.

A prior art sound insulating plate is shown in Fig. 1. This sound insulating plate is formed of a piece of steel plate 1, that is, of a single layer. As shown in Fig. 2, this single layer sound insulating plate is usually formed by pressing a cold or hot worked steel plate 1 with a press machine provided with a male die 2 and a female die 3. Another prior art sound insulating plate is a double layer sound insulating plate having a layer of synthetic resin, such as polyurethane, fixed to the surface of a steel plate, which is usually made by press work. In these prior art single or double layer sound insulating plates, however, since the total sound insulation effect is equal to only the sum of the effects due to the steel plate and the synthetic resin, the effect of sound insulation is not great. Therefore, in order to increase the sound insulation effect, it is necessary to attach a heavy, high damping material such as rubber to the plate or to increase the thickness of the plate itself. As a result, there exists a problem in that it is very troublesome to attach the high damping material and, in addition, the weight and thickness of the sound insulating plate inevitably increase. In view of the above description, reference is now made to a first embodiment of the sound insulating plate for insulating audible noise produced by a mechanism according to the present invention. Fig. 3 shows a first embodiment of the sound insulating plate according to the present invention. First, the configuration thereof will be described. The reference numeral 10 denotes a steel plate.A layer of low density thermoplastic resin is fixed to one surface of the steel plate 10. This thermoplastic resin layer 11 is of a low density foam type such as polyamide, polyurethane, etc., which will fuse and condense when partially melted or treated with high heat. The reference numeral 12 denotes a high density external layer, which is formed by heating the external surface of the low density thermoplastic resin layer 11 to a temperature at which a heat hardened layer can be formed. Now, the method of manufacturing such a sound insulating plate will be described. Figs. 4 and.5 show some manufacturing steps for the sound insulating plate according to the present invention. First, as shown in Fig. 4, the low density thermoplastic resin foam layer 11 of predetermined thickness is fixed to the surface of the steel plate 10.Next, as shown in Fig. 5, a heat plate 13 heated with a heater H is brought near the surface of the thermoplastic resin layer 11 with an appropriate clearance, in order to heat, contract, and harden the surface of the thermoplastic resin layer 11. After that, when the heat plate 13 is removed, an external high density heat hardened layer 12 will cover the resin layer 11. In order to obtain an effective audible noise reduction effect as explained later, the thickness and the density of the external heat hardened layer 12 are adjusted by controlling the temperature of the heat plate 13, the distance between the heat plate 13 and the thermoplastic resin layer 11, and the length of time for which the heat plate 13 is heated. According to experimental results, an appropriate specific gravity for the external heathardened layer 12 is in the range 0.8 to 1.2 and an appropriate specific gravity for the thermplastic resin layer 11 is in the range of 0.01 to 0.5. Fig. 6 shows a second manufacturing method of the sound insulating plate according to the present invention, in which it is possible to accurately conform the surface of the layer 12 with a uniform density. In the figure, steel plate 10 provided with the thermoplastic resin layer 11 thereon is first mounted on a supporting base 14, and next the heat plate 13 is heated to a high temperature after being brought into pressure contact with the, surface of the thermoplastic resin layer 11. In this case, it is possible to form the external heat hardened layer 12 quickly. Fig. 7 shows a modified sound insulating plate according to the present invention, and Fig. 8 shows a third manufacturing method for the modified sound insulating plate according to the present invention. In this embodiment, the external heat hardened layer 12 covering the thermoplastic resin layer 11 is formed in an appropriate shape so as to fit the mechanism to be insulated. As shown in Fig. 7, when an irregular profile is required for the surface of the external heat hardened layer 12, the irregular external layer 12 can be formed by bringing a heat plate 13 having a plurality of projections 15 near the surface of the thermoplastic resin layer ll, in order to heat, partially melt, and harden the layer 11, and after that, separating the heat plate 13 from the newly formed heat hardened layer 12. When it is necessary to accurately. conform the surface of the layer 12 with a uniform density, as shown inFig. 8, the steel plate 10 with the thermoplastic resin layer 11 fixed thereon is first mounted on a supporting base 14 and , a finishing model plate 20 having projections l9 is fixed to the lower surface of the heat plate 13, and next the heat plate 13 is heated to a high temperature after being brought into pressure contact with the surface of the thermoplastic resin layer 11. When the sound insulating plate is formed in such a way that the heat plate 13 or the finishing model plate 20 is formed into a shape similar to that of the surface of a mechanism to which the sound insulating plate is to be attached, for instance, when the sound insulating plate is formed into the same shape as that of an engine, even though the profile of the engine is irregular, it is possible to fit the sound insulating plate onto the engine with an appropriate constant clearance therebetween that is, it is possible to muffle audible noise produced by the engine without deteriorating engine performance. Fig. 9 shows the sound insulation curve of the sound insulating plate c according to the present invention, and includes the curves for the prior art single layer plate a and double layer plate b for comparison. In this figure, the abscissa represents the frequency f KHz and the ordinate represents the effect of sound insulation effect dB . Therefore, in the figure, the greater the numeral value of sound insulation dB, the higher the sound insulation effect. In the case of the characteristic curve a of the prior art single layer sound insulating plate, the sound insulation effect is about 20 dB at a frequency of 0.5 KHz and is about 40 dB at 5 KHz. The sound insulation effect between 0.5 and 5 KHz is roughly proportional to frequency, in accordance with inertial effects. To facilitate comparison of the sound insulation effects, the sound insulation effect values at a frequency of 5 KHz will referred to hereinafter as the representative values. The representative value of the steel plate is X5 40 dB, as can be clearly understood from Fig. 9. As shown by the characteristic curve b, in the case of the prior art double layer sound insulating plate in which a synthetic resin layer is formed on a steel plate, the sound insulation effect is about 20 dB at a frequency of 0.5 KHz, but is about 50 dB at 5 KHz. The sound insulation effect between 0.5 KHz and 5 KHz is roughly proportional to frequency, similar the characteristic curve a. The representative value of the double layer plate is X5 Y5 40 dB 8 dB 48 dB. That is to say, an additional sound insulation effect of Y5 8 dB is obtained at frequencies near 5 KHz, in comparison to the sound insulation effect X5 40 dB obtained when only a steel plate is used. This is due to the additional sound damping effect Y due to the synthetic resin that is, the sound waves are attenuated as they pass through the synthetic resin. Therefore, as compared with the case of the single layer sound insulation plate, the sound insulation effect increases by 8 dB. In the case of the sound insulating plate according to the present invention, the sound insulation effect is about 27 dB at a frequency of 0.5 KHz, but is about 62 dB at 5 KHz. The sound insulation effect between 0.5 KHz and 5 KHz is roughly proportional to frequency, similar to the characteristic curves a and b. In this case, the representative value of the insulating plate of the present invention is X5 Y5 Z5 40 dB 8 dB 14 dB 62 dB. That is to say, the high density thermoplastic heat hardened resin layer formed by applying heat to the low density thermoplastic resin layer disposed on the steel plate results in an additional sound insulation effect Z5 14 dB at a frequency of 5 KHz . In the case of the sound insulating plate according to the present invention, in addition to the sound damping effect due to the low density foam thermoplastic resin layer, which is roughly the same as that Y due to the synthetic resin layer on the prior art double layer sound insulation plate, there is an additional sound insulation effect Z based on cover effect due to the fact that sound waves within the thermoplastic resin layer are repeatedly reflected and attenuated between the high density external layer and the steel plate. Therefore, in spite of having roughly the same thickness and weight as that of the prior art double layer sound insulation plate, the sound insulation plate of the present invention has an improved sound insulation effect. As described above, in the sound insulation plate according to the present invention, since there is a lowdensity thermoplastic resin layer having a predetermined thickness on the surface of a metal plate, and further since there is a high density external heat hardened layer on the low density thermoplastic resin formed by heating the external surface of the thermoplastic resin layer, in addition to the sound insulation effect or sound damping effect due to the low density thermoplastic resin layer, there exists another sound insulation effect based on a covering effect due to the external heat hardened layer such that the sound waves of noise within the thermoplastic resin layer are repeatedly reflected and attenuated between the high density external heat hardened layer and the steel plate, thus improving sound insulation effect compared with the case in the prior art sound insulating plate. Further, since the sound insulation effect of the plate according to the present invention is great, it is possible to reduce the thickness and the weight of the sound insulation plate. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description is in terms of preferred embodiments of the present invention wherein various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as set forth in the appended claims.
