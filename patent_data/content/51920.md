# Memory arrangement with means for interfacing a central processing unit.

## Abstract
A memory device provided with an improved control circuit for enabling effective interface with a CPU. The device comprising a memory circuit, a first terminal for receiving a strobe signal for making the memory circuit in an accessed state, a second terminal for receiving a chain of clock signals, digital count means for counting the clock signals in response to the strobe signal having a plurality of different value of count, output terminals, means for selectively deriving a count signal from one of the count output terminal according to a programmed state, means for generating a ready signal for indicating the completion of the access operation of the memory circuit in response to the count signal.
