# Magnetic damping system having low induction magnet.

## Abstract
The invention provides a magnetic damping system for induction devices having electroconductive disk armatures 14 includes a low induction, high coercive force magnet 32 or 34 that is vertically elongated and has a horizontal direc tion of magnetization parallel to the disk. Flux concentrating pole pieces 58, 60 or 62, 64 adjoin the magnet pole faces for vertically directing two closely spaced braking magnetic fields from a pair of pole tips 58a, 60a or 62a, 64a and into the disk. A temperature compensating arrangement 90, 92 or 94, 96 covers the sides of the permanent magnet between the edges of the pole pieces to efficiently compensate for higher revers ible temperature coefficients of magnet remanence. The invention may be used in an electromechanical meter for measuring electrical power consumption.
