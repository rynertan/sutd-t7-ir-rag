# Two part synthesizer modulation system using a reference phase modulator.

## Abstract
An improved frequency modulator arrangement for use in a phase locked loop frequency synthesizer is disclosed which provides high deviation, low distortion, FM signals from a wide range of modulating signals such as digital data or low frequency tone modulation. This arrangement advan tageously injects the modulation signal into two ports, one at the VCO and the other at an added phase modulator. The added phase modulator is inserted ahead of either input to the phase detector of the phase locked loop. By properly balanc ing the level and polarity of the modulation signal into each of these two ports, a cancellation effect occurs which nulls the modulation signal at the output of the phase detector. Thus, in the first three embodiments, the added phase modulator is inserted in the reference source signal path to the phase detector, while in an alternate fourth embodiment, the phase modulator is inserted into the feedback path and includes a phase inverter stage to correct for the inherent modulation polarity reversal.

## Description
TWO PORT SYNTHESIZER MODULATION SYSTEM USING A REFERENCE PHASE MODULATORBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to modulators and more particularly to an improved method and arrangement for modulating phase locked loop frequency synthesizers. This arrangement can accommodate signals such as digital data or low frequency tone modulation and can produce high deviation, low distortion, FM signals while exhibiting a flat, wide, modulation bandwidth that is independent of the phase locked loop bandwidth. Today s communications systems require efficient use of the crowded radio spectrum, especially in congested metropolitan areas. To achieve efficient use of this limited congested spectrum, modern communications systems use elaborate data and tone coded signalling schemes which place constraints on the overall transzbitter design. Such transmitters may be expected to maintain their carrier frequency with high stability and yet offer fast lock time and wide deviation capability, all of which limit the ways in which the transmitter may be modulated. In any event, certain techniques have been developed which provide the desired carrier frequency stability and yet allow wide deviation capabilities.Such techniques, generally utilizing a high stability unmodulated reference oscillator in conjunction with a phase locked loop frequency synthesizer, allow for quick change of channels while maintaining the required system frequency stability. These phase locked loop arrangements generally include a frequency divider in the loop feedback path which allows for ease of channel selection and which also provides a way in which to effect wide output deviation. One known improvement utilizes dual port modulation of a frequency synthesizer loop applying modulation to both the voltage controlled oscillator and through a summing network to the phase detector output to achieve wide deviation capability for low frequency tones while maintaining a high degree of frequency stability.While such an arrangement is suitable for some system designs, it nevertheless suffers from two serious drawbacks. The first disadvantage is that it does not balance the two modulation ports over a wide bandwidth if there are variations in the phase detector gain. In such an arrangement, any temperature variations in phase detector gain will change the effect of modulation sensitivity. Where the modulation sensitivity is high, any variation can be significant. A second disadvantage of such an arrangement is that the reference modulation input must be maintained in phase synchronism with the VCO voltage controlled oscillator modulation components in a suitable delay network, such as a sample and hold circuit. Without such a delay network, the frequency synthesizer suffers degradation to data modulation, especially with relatively fast data rates. There will also be additional spurious output sidebands generated in such an arrageet due to the lack of a suitable delay network.This correspondingly greater spurious output requires additional attenuation in the loop filter to prevent degrading the synthesizer s spurious output performance still further. Each of these disadvantages leads to serious compromises in system performance which are undesirable. Accordingly, there exists a need for an improved frequency modulated phase locked loop frequency synthesizer arrangement which is able to accommodate signals such as data or low frequency tone modulation and which can produce high deviation, low distortion, FM signals while exhibiting a flat, wide, modulation bandwidth that is indepenent of the phase locked loop bandwidth.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved, frequency modulated phase locked loop frequency synthesizer arrangement having high stability and wide deviation capability which overcomes the foregoing deficiencies. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved frequency modulated phase locked loop frequency synthesizer arrangement of the foregoing type having high stability and a modulation frequency response which is independent of the loop bandwidth. In practicing the invention, a frequency modulator arrangement is provided which includes a high stability unmodulated reference oscillator within a phase locked loop frequency synthesizer. A selectable integer loop divider is incorporated which not only selects the desired output frequency, but also provides a way to achieve the desired wide deviation capability. The modulation information is injected at two separate ports within the phase locked loop frequency synthesizer. The first port is at the input of the voltage controlled oscillator, while the second port consists of a serrasoid type phase modulator interposed l i . the output of the fixed divider and the reference sign 3 input cf the phase detector.The modulation of the reterence signal is accomplished by frequency molting the critical, or rising, edge of the output of the reference divider before it is applied to the phase detector. The modulation information inputted to the phase modulator is first integrated in order to produce frequency modulation of the reference signal. With the modulated output signal fed back through the loop divider and nulled with the modulated reference signal, the preferred embodiment of the present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the known prior art. Another embodiment of the present invention utilizes the frequency modulator in the feedback path between the loop divider and the phase detector in conjunction with a phase inverter to achieve cancellation of the modulation before applying the signal to the phase detector.The result of using either of these two port modulation systems is an essentially flat modulation frequency response having a widened usable bandwidth, as well as a widened deviation capability given by the factor N of the loop divider, each being set independently of the loop bandwidth. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the accompanying specification, claims, and drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals indicate like elements in the several figures and in which Figure 1 is a block diagram of a frequency modulator arrangement illustrating the simplest form of ti present invention.

Figure 6 is another embodiment of the frequency modulated phase locked loop frequency synthesizer showing an offset method for generating wide deviation high frequency RF signals at a low carrier frequency. Figure 7 is another embodiment of the frequency modulated phase locked loop frequency synthesizer utilizing the frequency modulator in the feedback path between the loop divider and the phase detector in conjunction with a modulation phase inverter. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring now to the drawings, a basic phase locked loop or PULL frequency synthesizer arrangement 10 is shown in Figure 1 which, as indicated, includes a two port modulation capability. This PLL synthesizer arrangement consists of a reference source 12, a frequency modulator 14, a phase detector 16, a voltage controlled oscillator or VCO 18 having an output 20, a portion of which is fed back to phase detector 16. The modulating signal enters at 22 and is fed to each of the two ports, 24 and 26, so as to modulate the frequency of output 20. Thus, by using this two port modulation arrangement on a PLL frequency synthesizer, cancellation of the two modulating signals at the output of phase detector 16 results. A rred embodiment of the modulated PLL frequency synthesizer arrangement of the present invention depicted at 30 that is more likely to be utilized in a multi channel transmitter or transceiver is shown in Figure 2. Like numerals are employed for corresponding components wherever applicable. In this embodiment, the PLL consists of a reference oscillator 32, such as a high stability oscillator of any suitable design of known art, a fixed integer divider 34, a phase modulator 36, a phase detector 16, a loop filter 38, aVCO 18 having an output 20, a portion of which is fed back through variable integer divider 40 to phase detector 16. In this embodiment, an integrator 42 is used in conjunction with phase modulator 36 to effect frequency modulation of the reference signal going into the phase detector 16.This arrangement, like the one inFigure 1, depends on cancellation of the modulating signals at the output of the phase detector 16 to achieve the wide output deviation at low distortion. The arrangement 30 of Figure 2 allows the modulation signal bandwidth to be set independently of the requirements for the loop bandwidth which is controlled by means of loop filter 38. More particularly, the use of a loop divider 40 provides the capability of magnifying the effective deviation maintained by cancellation of the modulating signals at the output of phase detector 16. A basic diagram of the phase modulator depicted at 36 having an inherent phase inversion is shown inFigure 3 and is of the serrasoid type. A switch 44, acted upon by reference frequency fr, creates a pulse stream at the periodic rate of fr having a voltage ramp on the critical, or rising, edge due to current source 46 and capacitor 48. This effect is shown by Figures 4b, 4c. This signal is compared with the value of the modulation signal 50 plus a D.C. bias voltage 52 in connection with comparator 54. The resultant modulated reference signal fr appears at output 56 of comparator 54. The signals are shown in Figures 4a 4d. Any serrasoid modulator whichModulates the trip voltage of comparator 54 or modulates the slope of the ramp such that the rising edge shifts so as to affect the phase detector may be used. A preferred embodiment of the type of serrasoid phase modulator explained above and again having an inherent phase inversion is shown at 60 in Figure 5. The switch being toggled by reference frequency fr consists of transistors 62a b with associated bias circuitry 64a b, 66. The current source consists of resistors 68, 70 filtered by capacitor 72, feeding capacitor 48. The resultant modulated reference signal fr is sent to the comparator which consists of transistors 74a b and associated bias resistor 76, and compared with the modulation signal inputted through bias network 78, 80 by integrator network 82, 84 and coupling capacitor 86.Thus, by modulating the trip voltage of the comparator, the serrasoid phase modulator generates a modulated reference signal. Still another arrangement of a modulated PLL frequency synthesizer apparatus embodying the present invention is depicted at 90 in Figure 6. This arrangement is especially useful for lower frequency ranges requiring proportionally large deviation with low distortion. As will be noted, it is similar to the PLL synthesizer depicted in Figure 2, but takes the reference oscillator signal at 92, passes it through a multiplier 94 to the injection port 96 of an offset mixer 98 in order to offset or down mix the modulated signal 20 to a lower frequency 100 while maintaining the same amount of deviation with low distortion. Finally, an alternate embodiment of a modulated PLL frequency synthesizer apparatus embodying the present invention is depicted at 110 in Figure 7. As will be noted, it is similar to the PLL synthesizer arrangement depicted in Figure 2, but instead utilizes the frequency modulator consisting of phase modulator 12 and integrator 14 with a phase inverter 112 to achieve cancellation of the modulation components of the loop feedback signal 114 before inputting this feedback signal to phase detector 16. The modulated output frequency appears at output 116. In summary, each of the above mentioned arrangements 10, 30, 90, and 110 are able to accomplish the modulation of the PLL without losing gain balance between the two ports 24, 26 caused by variations in phase detector gain and without the need for a suitable delay network for maintaining proper phase synchronization of the modulated reference and modulatedVCO signal components. Each exhibits an essentially flat, wide modulation bandwidth that is independent of the PLL bandwidth. Thus they are able to overcome the limitations of the known prior art. Although the several two port synthesizer modulation arrangements of the present invention fully disclose many of the attendant advantages, it is understood that various changes and modifications not depicted herein are apparent to those skilled in the art.Therefore, even though the form of the above described invention is merely a preferred or exemplary embodiment given with practical alternates, further variations may be made in the form, construction, and arrangement of the parts without departing from the scope of the above invention.
