## Description
The present invention is directed to an electrohydraulic control system showing the features a , b , c and d of claim 1 and forming a closed loop control. In a known servo mechanism of that kind US A 2,954,514 a summing network as a comparing means is provided for delivering an error signal from the comparison of a reference quantity and a feedback actual position quantity, the reference generating means may include time derivative and integrating circuits for improving the dynamic response of the servo mechanism. Differing modes of operation are not provided. In a known machine tool control US A 3,517,283 a hydraulic motor is controlled by a pilot controlled valve to move a table and load between predetermined datum points. At the beginning of the movement, an appropriate feed rate signal from a programmer is supplied to the pilot stage of the valve, yet when the datum point is approached, a slowing down speed signal is produced until the table comes to rest. To that end, a sensor head is moved independently of the table motion with respect to a magnetic track so as to produce the slowing down signal. Whereas data means carrying the datum points may be changed or removed, when a during a rest period a workpiece change is intended, during operation of the device it is not possible to variably position the load, i.e. to deviate from the intended relative movement of the tool and workpiece. In operation, an arbitrary selection between programmed feed rate and slowing down speed of the table or vice versa is not possible, i.e. the speed at the beginning of the movement is always high and at the end always low, and speed changes at will are not possible. The command means are not constructed and provided to generate a position command signal as a direct function of an input command signal or to integrate the input command signal for obtaining the position command signal dependent upon a control mode which is determined by selecting means. Electrohydraulic valve control systems for vehicles and like applications often require differing control modes at various stages of operation. For example, an excavator may require position control of the bucket teeth during a digging cycle, velocity control during other modes of operation, and incremental position control, i. e. position control from a starting or base position, during the fine control cycle. It is conventional to provide separate position and velocity sensors for closed loop feedback during the position and velocity control modes respectively. However, provision of multiple sensors adds to the overall cost and complexity of the system. It is a general object of the present invention to provide an electrohydraulic servo system which may selectively operate in either the position or the velocity control mode while employing only one feedback sensor. The servo system should be capable of being implemented in either an absolute position control mode or an incremental position mode, which may be selected at will. The solution of the problem referred to above may be found in the combination of the features of claim 1. Further developments are contained in claims 2 to 6. The present invention contemplates an electrohydraulic servo system which includes a hydraulic valve and an actuator for variably positioning a load, such as the bucket of an excavator. A position sensing transducer is coupled to the actuator and load to provide an electrical signal indicative of actual position at the actuator and load. The actuator is controlled by an error signal as a function of the difference between a position command signal and the transducer signal indicative of actual position. In accordance with the present invention, the position control servo system includes a command circuit responsive to an operator mode select switch for generating the position command signal as differing functions of an operator input signal, from a joystick or the like, depending upon the selected control mode of operation. In an absolute position control mode, the position command signal is a direct continuous function of the joystick input command signal. In an incremental position control mode, a base position signal equal to the actual position signal is established when the input command signal is equal to zero, and the position command signal thereafter varies as a function of the sum of the base position signal and the input command signal when the input command signal is non zero. In a velocity control mode, the input command signal is first integrated to provide a facsimile position command signal. When the input command signal is non zero, the position command signal varies as a direct function of the facsimile position command signal. When the input command signal is equal to zero, the position command signal is made equal to the actual position signal, eliminating dead time in the velocity control mode when it is desired to change the direction of motion at the load. The invention, together with additional objects, features and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional position command electrohydraulic servo control system 10 as comprising a valve actuator system 12, which includes an electrohydraulic valve coupled by an actuator to a load. The actuator system, including the load, is characterized by an inertial mass and spring elasticity. A position sensor or transducer 14 is suitably mechanically coupled to the actuator and load to provide an electrical output signal X as a function of actual actuator and load position. A position command or reference signal R from an operator joystick 15, for example, is fed to a summer 16, which provides an error signal E as a function of the difference between the command signal R and the actual position signal X. The error signal E, fed through a suitable amplifier having gain 18, controls operation of actuator 12. It will be appreciated that summer 16 and gain 18 would typically be combined in a single amplifier. System 12 and transducer 14 may be of any suitable types, and indeed may be contained within a single assembly. FIG. 2 illustrates an electrohydraulic servo system 20 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention wherein the operator joystick 15 provides an input joystick command signal J to a position reference generator or command circuit 22. Generator 22 also receives a mode control input SW from a three position mode select switch 24, and receives the signal X from sensor 14 indicative of actual position at the actuator and load. Generator 22 provides the position command reference output R to summer 16. The remaining elements in FIG. 2 correspond with identically referenced elements in FIG. 1. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, mode select switch 24 is responsive to manual activation by an operator for selecting among an absolute position control mode wherein the joystick output signal J is treated as indicating desired position at the actuator and load, an incremental position control mode wherein the joystick output signal J is treated as indicating a change of position desired by an operator from a base position, and a velocity control mode of operation wherein the joystick output signal J is treated as indicating desired velocity at the actuator and load. Preferably, position reference generator 22 comprises a suitably programmed digital microprocessor, operation of which in the absolute position, incremental position and velocity control modes is illustrated functionally in FIGS. 5, 4 and 3 respectively. More particularly, when the absolute position control mode is selected by an operator at switch 24, position reference generator 22 is automatically internally configured as illustrated at 22a in FIG. 5 so that the position reference command signal R to summer 16 varies as a direct continuous function of, and preferably is made equal to, the input joystick command signal J. When incremental position control is selected at switch 24, generator 22 is functionally internally configured as illustrated at 22 i in FIG.4.When the input joystick command signal J is equal to zero in the incremental position control mode, the actual position signal X is stored to establish a base position signal R₀. Thereafter, when the input joystick command signal J departs from zero, the position reference command signal R to summer 16 varies as a function of, and preferably is made equal to, the sum of the base position signal R₀ and the input command signal J. When the velocity control mode of operation FIG. 3 is selected at switch 24, the joystick input command signal J is integrated at 22S to provide a facsimile position command signal R , division of the signal J by the Laplace character S , being a standard technique for illustrating an integration operation. If the joystick command input is equal to zero, in the functional part 22V of generator 22 the position command signal R to summer 16 is set equal to the actual position signal X from sensor 14, so that the error signal E FIG. 2 will be equal to zero and no motion will take place at the actuator and load. When the joystick command signal J is non zero, the position command signal R follows the facsimile position command signal R so that the position loop is effectively controlled by the integral of the joystick input signal. It is presently preferred to implement summer 16, gain stage 18 and position reference generator 22 FIG. 2 in a suitably programmed digital computer controller 30, as shown in FIG. 6, which receives and periodically samples input J from operator joystick 15, input SW from operator mode select switch 24 and input X from the load position sensor 14. Controller 60 provides outputs to the solenoids of a valve 32, for example, which selectively feeds hydraulic fluid under pressure from a source and pump 34 to a drive cylinder 36. The piston of cylinder 36 is coupled to the load. Analog circuitry could also be employed in controller 30, as will be apparent to the artisan. Likewise, it is contemplated that means other than a manual joystick 15, such as automated control means, may be employed to provide the input signal J.
