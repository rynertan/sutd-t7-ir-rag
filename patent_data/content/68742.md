## Description
SHAPED ARTICLES This invention relates to shaped articles, and especially to suci articles which are for use in the building industry. The Invention relates especially to boards and sheets, both flat and corrugated, which are for use for example for cladding and roofing, and to shaped fitments therefor. The invention is also concerned with compositions for use in the manufacture of such shaped articles. Of all the materials which are known and available for roofing and cladding, asbestos reinforced corrugated cement sheets and boards are among the best, since they possess good strength and their weathering characteristics give them a long life. The basic disadvantage of asbestos cement sheets is the fact that they contain asbestos, a fibrous material the dust of which is thought to constitute a health hazard, and the industry is therefore constantly seeking alternatives to this material. No single material has been found with characteris tics whicl satisfactorily match all tose of asbestos, and it has thus been proposed to use mixtures of materials, e.g. mixtures of fibrous materials such as cellulose and glass fibres, and mixtures of cellulose fibres with mica or vermiculite. Where fire resistance is not so important cellulose fibres have been used alone to replace asbestos and sheets for building purposes have been made from compositions of cellulosic fibres and cement. Such cellulose cement materials possess useful properties, but they are not suitable for outside use since their weathering ad freeze thaw resistance is unsatisfactory ad their long term strength is insufficient to meet the required wind loading specifications. Improved properties in these respects could be achieved by stabilising the cement binder i.e. by causing the products of cement llydration to react with a 51 liceous component. One way of achieving this is by autoclaving bu this requires the use of expensive capital equipment. We have now found that by careful selection of the siliceous compound products can be made with properties similar to those made by autoclaving, but without autoclaving. It is the primary object of the invention to provide a process and a composition for manufacturing non asbestos shaped articles, e.g. sheets, especially corrugated sheets, which possess the high strength and durability necessary to permit their satisfactory use as external building materials, e.g. as roofing and cladding sheets, without the need for autoclaving. According to the invention a process for manufacturing a non asbestos shaped article comprises forming into shape an aqueous slurry of a mixture comprising, on a dry weight basis, 50 90 cement, 5 40 highly reactive pozzolanic silica and 5 15 cellulose fibres, while removing water therefrom, and allowing reaction to occur between the cement and the silica by air curing. According to one process aspect, for forming a nonasbestos roofing or cladding sheet, the aqueous slurry is formed into flat sheet shape while removing water therefrom, for example using a lQatschek machine, is then if desired formed into corrugated shape, and is then subjected to air curing to cause the cement and highly reactive silica to react. In another process aspect, a corrugated roofing or cladding sheet is made by charging the aqueous slurry directly onto a corrugated former, for example forming part of a Magnani machine. The cement is preferably Ordinary Portland Cement. The highly reactive pozzolanic silica is preferably at least 80 pure and preferably 90 100 pure i.e. SiO2, and preferably has a specific surface area BET of at least 15,000 m2 kg, most suitably at least 25,000 m2 kg.The highly reactive silica is suitably present in the initial mixture in an amount of at least 15 , and preferably in an amount of 24 35, on a dry weight basis. Most suitably the highly reactive silica is volatilised silica. Suitable sources of volatilised silica are the by products of the production of silicorl metal and of ferro silicon. Another poterltiaZly suitable highly reactive pozzolanic silica is high quality diatolnite. Mixtures of pozzolanic silicas may be used e.g. a mixture of volatilised silica and diatomitc. The cellulose fibres are suitably woodpulp, cotton or flax. They are preferably used in an amount of 7 to 12 based on the dry weight of the initial mixture. They are suitably processed to a freeness within the range 18 350S2. The initial batch preferably also includes a flocculating agent to assist retention of the slurry solids during sheeting out. Th process of the invention for manufacturing sheets is suitably performed using one of the machines well known in tile asbestos cement sheet manufacturing industry, e.g.the Hatschel , Magnani and Fourdrinier machines. By mcans of the use of highly reactive silica the cement is reacted during air curing to a very substantial extent, the free lime which is liberated during hydration of the cemerit being taken up by reaction with the silica to produce a stable matrix. An additional advantage of the use of highly reactive finely divided silica is that it enhances the mouldabili ty of the sheeted out slurry. The process of the invention leads to a strony product, having good natural weathering properties, which mal e it eminently suitable for use as an exterior roofing and cladding material. The initial slurry may contain additional materials, for example additional reinforcing fibres, and powdered, granular or flaky fillers. Amongst the special fillers which may be used, all of which have particular propertyenhancing characteristics, may be mentioned wollastonite, mica, vermiculite and perlite. These may be present, individually or in any combination, in an amount up to a total of 50 Ó by weight, based on the solids content of the initial slurry, and suitably in an individual amount of 2 to 30, preferably 5 to 13, on the same basis.The additional fibres may include inorganic fibres, e.g. glass or mineral wool fibres in amounts up to 208ú by weight based on the solids content of the initial slurry and organic fibres, e.g polypropylene fibres in amounts of 0.05 to 1.0, on the same basis. Although the process of the invention is especially adapted for the production of sheets, both flat and corrugated, and is particularly described in relation thereto,it is also appropriate to the production of other shaped articles for use in the building industry. Among these may be mentioned roofing and cladding fitments, e.g. roof lining articles, closures, and bargeboards. A typical sheet manufacturing procedure involves the following sequence of operations 1 The cellulose fibres, e.g. of woodpulp, cotton, flax, are processed by pulping, beating and refining, preferably to a freeness in the range 18 to 350 SR. 2 The other ingredients of the batch, i.e. cement, highly reactive silica, other fillers and fibres if desired, and flocculating agents where appropriate, are mixed with the processed cellulose pulp to produce an aqueous slurry. 3 The slurry is taken up on the moving permeable felt of a Hatschek machine and forms a thick film of damp composition thereon which is transferred to a rotating drum on which the mixture builds up. 4 When a desired thickness of mixture has built up on the drum it is removed in the form of a flat sheet, of length e.g. 1 to 4 metres. 5 The flat sheet is formed into corrugated form, if desired. 6 It is advisable that, to ensure satisfactory weathering and strength characteristics, the density of the product should exceed 1350 kg m3. If it is necessary the density of a corrugated sheet may be increased by compression as described in our copending Patent ApplicationNo. of even date. 7 The sheet is passed through a steam tunnel wherein it is air cured. After 4 to 8 hours the sheets have hardened sufficiently to enable them to be stripped from the stack. The conditions in the steam tunnel are suitably a minimum temperature of bOOC, and a relative humidity of at least 85to. Curing conditions should pre ferably be iained for at least 24 hours. 8 Instead of 7 above, the sheets can be cured in air without the use of steam, or indeed any other source of heat than tlle cemerit, the hydration of which is an exothermic reaction which generates sufficient heat to accelerate the lime silica reaction. It is however highly advisable to insulate and seai the stacks to prevent heat loss and maintain the humidity at a high level. 9 The sheets are allowed to mature in warm moist conditions for 7 14 days.
