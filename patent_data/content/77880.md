# Sleeve type fluid flow diverter.

## Abstract
A fluid flow diverter includes a housing 52 and a rotatable sleeve 57 mounted for rotation on an axle 62 and spaced inwardly from the housing walls 53, 54, 55 . The sleeve and housing include ports 69, 70, 73, 74, 77 80 which are selectively positioned in registered or unregistered relationship, depending upon which of two operative posi tions the sleeve assumes. The sleeve forms a single internal chamber 57a through which fluid always flows in the same direction in both operative positions of the sleeve. The space between the sleeve and housing also forms a single chamber 61 through which fluid always flows in the same direction in both operative positions of the sleeve. The unidirectional fluid flow through the sleeve itself is opposite to the unidirectional fluid flow through the external chamber between the housing and sleeve. The supporting connection between the cylindrical sleeve and housing walls occurs adjacent the registered sleeve and housing ports by means of mating peripheral supporting surfaces 85 88, 89 91 . In either position of the sleeve, the unused or unregistered sleeve ports face the interior wall of the housing with their supporting surfaces spaced therefrom. A filler member 92, 93, 94 is mounted to the housing interior wall adjacent the position of each unregistered sleeve supporting surface.
