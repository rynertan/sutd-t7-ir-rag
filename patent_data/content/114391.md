## Description
FLEXIBLE PROPYLENE POLYMER This invention relates to a novel flexible propylene polymer. More particularly, it relates to a flexible propylene polymer having excellent physical and mechanical properties. Propylene polymers used hitherto are highly crystalline, so called isotactic, polypropylene. This polypropylene, however, though it has excellent mechanical properties including high rigidity, has poor melt properties such as a small melt tension, and cannot be processed easily when the processing requires a large melt tension. Further, the formed articles thereof have the defect of low weld strength. Moreover, since the films formed thereof by conventional methods are poor in transparency, some special equipment and processing method are require to improve the transparency. Furthermore, because of its high rigidity and hardness, the polypropylene mentioned above is not suitable for applications where a certain degree of flexibility is required. There is known a process to produce polypropylene by using a catalyst which yields a low stereospecific polymer in order to impart flexibility to the product. The polypropylene thus obtained has, however, disadvantages in that it has poor mechanical properties and heat resistance, that it has poor processability because of its low melt tension as well as low swelling ratio, and that, when processed into a film, the film shows undesirable blocking tendency owing to bleeding out of atactic polypropylene to its surf ace. So this product has low commercial value. In view of these circumstances, the inventors made an extensive study and have found a propylene polymer which has excellent physical and mechanical properties as well as an excellent processability, and is flexible without the disadvantages mentioned above. This invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding. An object of this invention is to provide a novel flexible propylene polymer having excellent physical and mechanical properties. Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the descriptions that follow. According to this invention, there is provided a flexible propylene polymer which is a propylene polymer obtained by gas phase polymerization, said polymer being in particle form after polymerization and having a bulk density of at least 0.27 g ml, wherein 1 the ratio of weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight is from 10 to 100, 2 the intrinsic viscosity ri is from 0.8 to 10 dl g, 3 in the steric pentad fraction as determined by 13C NMR, the mmmm fraction is from 0.45 to 0.85, 4 the melt flow ratio MFR satisfies the following equation MFR 2 42 log MI 133, wherein MI means melt index, 5 the fusion temperature is from 154 to 164 C, 6 the heat of fusion is from 5 to 22 cal g, 7 the intrinsic viscosity 73BSp of the boilingheptane soluble portion HSP and the intrinsic viscosity HIP of the boiling heptane insoluble portion HIP of said polymer satisfy the following equation HEP 0.25 HIP and 8 in the steric pentad fraction of the above boiling heptane insoluble portion as determined by 13C NMR, the mmmm fraction is from 0.60 to 0.90 and the sum of the mmmr , rrrm and rrrr fractions is from 0.07 to 0.30. The flexible propylene polymer of this invention shows a large melt tension as well as a large swelling ratio, has excellent melt flow characteristics and, in spite of its flexibility, a relatively high heat distortion temperature Vicat softening temperature and also a high impact strength. This invention will be explained in detail below. In the polymer of this invention, the value of N weight average molecular weight MN number average molecular weight of the whole polymer is from 10 to 100.Values less than 10 or more than 100 are unfavorable because in the former range the melt tension of the polymer becomes small, while in the latter range the polymer production becomes difficult. Here, the values mentioned above refer to those which are obtained by determining molecular weight distribution by means of gel permeation chromatography and then calculating in a conventional manner the value of no from the graph of molecular weight distribution thus obtained. The intrinsic viscosity ii of the whole polymer is from 0.8 to 10, preferably from 1.0 to 8.0, and more preferably from 1.0 to 5.0 dljg. Intrinsic viscosities below 0.8 dl g or above 10 dl g are unfavorable because in both ranges the processing of the polymer becomes difficult. Here, intrinsic viiscosities refer to the values determined by means of an Ostwald viscometer in tetralin at 1350C. In the steric pentad fraction of the whole polymer as determined by 13C NMR, the mmm fraction sisotactic pentad fraction is from 0.45 to 0.85, and preferably from 0.50 to 0.85. Values below 0.45 or above 0.85 are unfavorable because in the former range the formed article obtained from the polymer has a low Shore hardness and heat distortion temperature, while in the latter range the product loses flexibility and is poor in impact strength and, when it is in the form of a film, has a poor transparency. In the polymer of this invention, the melt flow ratio MFR satisfies the following equation MFR 42 log MI 133, wherein MI means melt index. A propylene polymer wherein the MFR does not satisfy the above equation has, even when the MI is the same, an inferior melt flowability and, in extrusion molding, tends to put too much load on the motor.Here, MI and MFR are determined in the following way.First, MI is determined according to ASTM D1238 L expressed in grams per 10 minutes at 230 0C under a load of 2.16 kg . Separately, MI21 6 is determined in a similar manner except that a load of 21.6 kg is used instead of 2.16 kg. The MFR is calculated from the following equation MFR melt flow ratio MI21 61MI. The propylene polymer of this invention has a fusion temperature in the range of from 154 to 1640C, and a heat of fusion in the range of from 5 to 22 cal g. When the fusion temperature is below 1540C or the heat of fusion is less than 5 cal g, the polymer is poor in heat resistance. On the other hand, when the fusion temperature is above 1640C or the heat of fusion is more than 22 cal g, the polymer is poor in impact strength and low temperature resistance. These are unfavorable. Here, the fusion temperature and the heat of fusion are determined in the following way.Method of determination A differential scanning calorimeter, DSC Type II made by Perkin Elmer Inc. is used. Ten mg of a sample is placed in the pan, maintained at 500 K for 5 minutes under a nitrogen gas stream to fuse completely, and then quenched under the same conditions by changing the setting temperature to room temperature. After the temperature of the sample has reached the room temperature, the temperature is raised at a rate of SoC minute to give a fusion curve of the sample. The fusion temperature Tf is determined as the temperature at which the heatabsorption peak of the highest temperature reaches the maximum. Further, the heat of fusion AHf is determined from the fusion curve in a conventional manner. Further, in the polymer of this invention, the intrinsic viscosity 1HSP of the boiling heptane soluble portion HSP and the intrinsic viscosity HIP of the boiling heptane insoluble portion HIP should satisfy the following equation HSP 0.25 HIP When the equation is not satisfied in a polymer, the surface state of the formed article thereof is poor because atactic polypropylene is likely to bleed out to the surface. In the polymer of this invention, in the steric pentad fraction of the boiling heptane insoluble portion as determined by l3G NMR, the tsnmm fraction is from 0.60 to 0.90 and the sum of the tzmmr , rrrm and rrrr fractions is from 0.07 to 0.30. A mmmm fraction of less than 0.60 or a sum of the above mentioned fractions of more than 0.30 is unfavorable because the polymer has then poor physical and mechanical properties, particularly a poor heat resistance. On the other hand, a mmmm fraction of more than 0.9 or a sum of the above mentioned fractions of less than 0.07 is unfavorable because the polymer has then a poor flexibility and impact strength. The pentad fraction herein is determined according to the method reported by A.Zambelli et al Macromolecules, 6 925 1973 , namely by means of 13C NMR. The mmmm pentad fraction is the fraction of propylene monomer units existing in the center of the isotactic chains of a pentad unit in the molecular chain of polypropylene, in other word, chains of five successive sequence of monomer units joined in meso m linkages.However, the assignment of NMR absorption peaks is made according to a method reported later Macromolecules, 8, 867 1975 . Specifically, the isotactic pentad fraction is determined as the area fraction of the minmin peak in the total absorption peaks in the methyl carbon region of 13C NMR spectrum. Similarly, the mmmr , rrrr and rrrm fraction are respectively the fraction of propylene monomer units existing in the center of chains of propylene monomer units joined in meso m or racemic r linkages. As described in the foregoings, according to this invention, by fulfilling various conditions mentioned above, a propylene polymer can be obtained which has a suitable degree of flexibility and good physical and mechanical properties including heat distortion resistance and impact strength. The production of the polymer of this invention is now described below. A polymerization catalyst to be used favorably is one comprising 11 a solid catalyst component obtained by allowing silicon tetrachloride to react with an ethereal organo magnesium compound to give a magnesium compound, washing the resulting compound with an inert hydrocarbon solvent followed by drying if necessary, and then treating with an aryloxytitanium halide or alkoxytitanium halide in a hydrocarbon or halohydrocarbon solvent, preferably in chlorobenzene, followed by washing with an inert hydrocarbon solvent, 2 an organoaluminum compound component such as triethylaluminum and triisobutylaluminum and 3 a carboxylic acid ester such as methyl benzoate, sec butyl benzoate, methyl p anisate, ethyl p anisate, ethyl orthoformate, methyl orthoformate and methyl methacrylate or a lactone such as e caprolactone the third component . The concentrations of the solid catalyst and the organoaluminum compound can be suitably regulated within the range of from 0.1 to 1000 mg t and from 0.05 to 50 mmol t, respectively. The amount of the third component to be used is regulated within the range of fran 0.01 to 0.8 mol per 1 mol of the organoaluminum compound so as to give the objective polymer of this invention. The structure and other properties of the resulting polymer vary according to the conditions of catalyst preparation and the kinds of above mentioned components. Particularly, the intrinsic viscosity, pentad fraction, molecular weight distribution, etc. can be varied by varying the kind and amount of the third component to be used.Accordingly, polymerization is carried out by suitably adjusting the above mentioned factors so that the resulting polymer may satisfy the conditions of this invention. Also, hydrogen may be used to regulate the intrinsic viscosity of the resulting polymer. Gas phase polymerization is preferred. Preferable conditions for polymerization from the industrial viewpoint are selected from the ranges of temperature of from 30 to 80 0C and pressure of from atmospheric pressure to about 41 bar. This invention is featured by a flexible propylene polymer having excellent physical properties and in particle form. There is a method of producing a low stereospecific propylene polymer by polymerization in liquid propylene japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid open No. 148091 79 . By this method, however, it was difficult to obtain industrially a polymer in powder form having a good flowability. A good flowability of polymer in powder form facilitates the polymer handling in powder transfer, drying and granulation, and thus offers a great advantage to polymer production. It also facilitates the blending of various kinds of additives and colorants with polymer, and enables the production of polymer products having stable qualities. In a liquidphase polymerization, it is difficult to obtain a flexible propylene polymer of this invention which is in particle form having an excellent flowability and a high bulk density. The polymer of this invention can be obtained as such when the polymer prepared above falls in the scope of this invention. If necessary, the polymer of this invention can also be obtained by extracting the resulting polymer with a solvent such as heptane or xylene at a suitable temperature to remove a portion thereof. The polymer of this invention has excellent physical and mechanical properties as well as a good processability as mentioned above, and can be used in various applications including the production of films, yarns, tapes, foamed articles, sheets, as well as blowmolded, injection molded and vacuum formed articles. The propylene polymer of this invention has been found to be particularly suited for following applications. When used as films, the polymer of this invention has, as compared with conventional polypropylenes hdmopolymer or random copolymer hereinafter referred to asPP , superior heat resistance inspite of its pliability.It has also a good low temperature heat sealing characteristic and is favorably used as a sealant. Moreover, as compared with conventional PP, the polymer of this invention can be processed easily to blown film even when its intrinsic viscosity is high, and further, can be subjected to H type blown film process cf. Plastics, 29, 12 , 70 1978 to give a film having a high strength well balanced in machine and transverse directions. A polymer particularly suited for film application has an intrinsic viscosity n of from 1.3 to 5.0. In blow molding applications, the polymer of this invention, as compared with conventional PP, has less tendency to draw down in blow molding and gives a blow molded article having a more uniform thickness.The blow molded articles obtained from the polymer of this invention has an excellent heat resistance despite its flexibility, and is excellent in transperancy and environmental stress cracking resistance. A polymer particularly suited for this application has an intrinsic viscosity fl of fran 2.0 to 5.0. As compared with conventional PP in applications as sheets, it has the advantage in that, when the formed sheet is subjected to vacuum forming, a uniform deep drawing is possible. A polymer particularly suited for this application has an intrinsic viscosity tu in the same range as that for blow molding.As compared with conventional PP in applications as tapes or yarns, the polymer of this invention has the advantage in that it is less liable to splitting when stretched uniaxially after being extruded, and gives a pliable product having a high strength. A polymer particularly suited for this application has an intrinsic viscosity n of from 1.9 to 5.0. Further, as compared with conventional PP in injection molding applications, the polymer of this invention gives molded articles which have an excellent heat resistance despite their flexibility and also an excellent hinge characteristic, transparency, environmental stress cracking resistance and weld strength.A polymer particularly suited for injection molding has an intrinsic viscosity n of from 1.0 to 3.0. Various additives including antioxidants, light stabilizers, lubricants, anti blocking agents, antistatic agents, pigments, dyes and fillers colorants as well as other polymers may be admixed with the polymer of this invention within limits not deleterious to the objects of this invention. This invention will be illustrated in detail below with reference to Examples, but it is not limited thereto.

It is implied that when the parison length exceeds the critical parison length, the draw down phenomenon begins to take place. From Table 3, it can be seen that, as compared with a conventional polypropylene, the propylene polymer of this invention has, despite its low MI, a very wide molecular weight distribution and hence has the advantage of low motor load and further, since the parison length at which draw down begins, namely the critical parison length, is very long, a blow molded bottle with a low degree of uneven thickness in machine direction can be obtained.As to the properties of blow molded bottles, those from the polymer of Example 1 showed a see through clarity comparable with those from Comparative Example 2 and superior to those from Comparative Example 1.Bottles molded from the polymer.of Example 1 had a better heat resistance Vicat softening point than those fromComparative Example 2, while their flexibilities are similar.Example 8 The propylene polymer of this invention obtained in Example 1 and the conventional polypropylene shown inComparative Example 1 were used as samples to be tested in vacuum forming under the following processing conditions.Sheet preparation conditions Extruder TANABE 50 extruder Screw full flight type, L D 24 , C.R. 3.0 Die Coat hanger die 500 mm width, lip 0.5 mm t Processing temp. 2500C Cooling roll temp. 300C Take off speed 3 m min.

At temperatures above the maximum sheet surface temperature, the sagging of sheet becomes large. At temperatures below the minimum sheet surface temperature, the sheet cannot be elongated suf ficiently and whitening or rupture of the sheet can take place. It can be seen from Table 4 that, as compared with conventional polypropylene, the propylene polymer of this invention has a far superior deep drawing processability and can be processed by vacuum forming in a very wide temperature range. Example 9 The propylene polymer of this invention obtained in Example 3 and a conventional polypropylene shown inComparative Example 5 were used as samples to be tested in injection molding under the following processing conditions.
