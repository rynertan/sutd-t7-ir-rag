## Description
IRONING APPARATUS FOR HOUSEHOLD AND SEMI PROFESSIONAL APPLICATIONS This invention relates to an ironing apparatus for household and semi professional applications.As is known, ironing apparatus for household and semiprofessional applications have long been available commercially which incorporate a boiler generally mounted within the supporting base for the flat iron which is merely placed thereon both during the standby phases of the ironing process and when put aside because not used. With any such prior ironing apparatusthe flat iron is always left in full view, and the only protective enclosure provided, if any, is generally represented by the packaging box of the apparatus itself, or in the alternative, by some makeshift arrangement. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that with prior apparatusthe plate of the flat iron,when the latter is put aside after use, still retains for some time a high temperature that may become to cause for burns to children or persons incidentally touching it. Furthermore, while not being used, the flat iron is left exposed to the influence of dust and dirt which may create annoying problems on a later utilization thereof, such as, for example, soiling of a freshly cleaned cloth to be ironed. An additional drawback affecting prior ironing apparatus is that the flat irol power supply cables and steam hose, which may exceed two meters in length, are also left exposed and not coiled up, thus hindering convenient storage of the apparatus in restricted volumes such as those provided by a cupboard. iccordingly, the tast of the invention is that of obviating such prior problems by the provision of an ironing apparatus for household and semiprofessional applications, which affords a useful and safe form of protection of the flat iron against any accidental contacting of the still hot portions thereof by persons or children. Within that task it is an object of this invention to pror vlde an ironing apparatus which can be reduced to a oo pact size for storage, it having no power supply cables and steam hoses extending therefrom. It is another object of the invention to provide an ironing apparatus which can be easily transported from its storage place to its place of use, and vice versa. According to one aspect of the invention, the above task and objects as well as yet other objects are achieved by an ironing apparatus for household and semi professioiial applications, comprising a flat iron supporting base incorporating a steam generating boiler, characterized in that it comprises a protective cap for said flat iron provided with a handle, also provided being means for securing said protective cap to said said sapporting base. Further features amend advantages will be more readily understood from the following detailed description of an apparatus according to the invention, with reference to the accompanying illustrative drawing, where Figure 1 is a side elevation view showing in section the apparatus of this invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of the apparatus of this invention and Figure 3 of the securing means according to the invention. Nith special reference to Figure 1 of the drawing, an ironing apparatus according to the invention, as generally designated with the reference numeral 1, comprises a supporting base 2 having, at the surface thereof which is to receive a flat iron 3, a carpet 4 advantageously provided with a peripheral border 5 adapted to prevent the escape of any condensation water while the flat iron is placed on it. The supporting base 2 has on its interior a steam generating boiler 6, the generated steam being introduced into the flat txn through a hose line 7 having substantially the same length as the power supply cables 8, in order to facilitate the ironing operation even when carried out on surfaces away from the base 2. The ironing apparatus further includes a protective cap 9 which is advantageously configured to hold, after it has been applied to the base 2 and made rigid therewith by a fastener means generally indicated at 10, the flat umn at its selected position. The fastening means 10 includes a first element 15 which is connected rigidly to the cap 9 at a middle portion of the two juxtaposed sides, specifically the shorter length sides thereof, and the first element also comprises a dog 16 engaging with a second element 17 made rigid with the supporting base and having advantageously its remote end from that engaging with said dog 16 configured to secure to the base 2 its closure cover 18. For completeness sake, it should be noted that the cap 9 has a handle 11 which is expediently offset from the axis of the cap to permit accommodation of the power supply cables and steam delivery line within a compartment 12 located on one side of the handle 11. By way of example only, it should be further added that a portion of the flat 2xn handle is contained within the interior surface of the handle 11, thereby ensuring that, in moving the apparatus about, this is held fixedly in its selected position. It has been found, in actual practice, that the invention apparatus is peculiarly safeguarded against incidental contacts with still hot portions thereof by persons, and can be conveniently transported after use to storage areas therefor.
