# Improvements in burners.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a burner which, in one mode can serve as a burner per se and in an alternate mode as a flue for removing waste gas from a combustion space. The burner has a body 1 which defines a passage 2 forming in part a flow path for gases between two openings 3 and 4. The first opening serves either as inlet for receiving air for combustion with the fuel in a combustion chamber 16 in one mode of operation or as an outlet for discharging waste gas from the passage 2 in an alternate mode. The second opening 3 serves as an outlet for combustion products in the one mode of operation or as an inlet for receiving waste gas in the alternate mode. An assembly 5 injects fuel and air into the passage 2 and the fuel and air first mix in a nozzle 31 with the fuel being ignited by an electrode 47. The fuel is combusted in a pre combustion chamber 32 before entering the main combustion chamber 16. The fuel is partially or fully pre combusted irrespective of the mode in which the burner is operating to avoid prepurging with air or re ignition between flue and firing cycles.
