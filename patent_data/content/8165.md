# Clamping diaphragms or membranes in electrolytic cells.

## Abstract
A diaphragm or membrane electrolytic cell comprising a plurality of anodes and cathodes, a diaphragm or mem brane between adjacent anodes and cathodes, and slotted diaphragm or membrane supports, wherein the diaphragms or membranes 6 are sealed to the lips 12 defining the slots in the supports by means of one or more clamps which provide an essentially leak tight seal between the diaphragms or membranes and the lips on the supports. In a preferred embodiment the clamp comprises inner 30 and outer 31 flexible bands between which the assembly of diaphragm or membrane and lips are located and clip ping device 32 in the form of a wire bent into a sinuous path providing shaped profiles, which device is applied over the assembled inner and outer bands such that alternate profiles or groups of profiles lie on opposite sides of the assembly.
