# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING COMPRESSED DATA

## Abstract
Facsimile or other data to be reduced is scanned 10 and segmented into blocks of isolated figures 12A . The figures are compared to stored templates 12B . If no match is found, the figure remains in place. If a match is found, the figure remains in place. If a match is found, the figure is erased, i.e., the block is reduced to white. When recognized figures have been erased, the residual image is transmitted 15, 16 using an efficient known two dimensional encoding compression technique. The locations of figures are specified by inserting identifying data in the data stream at a point corresponding a point on the figure, the preferred point being the lower right hand corner. If not a recognized template, the receiving end 17 can extract the figure constructed from the data stream and store it in its template memory 17A . If a figure is a recognized template, it is extracted from the receiving end s template memory using the identifying data and inserted into the reconstructed residual image.
