## Description
3 HYDROXYCEPHALOSPORIN SOLVATES AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION This invention relates to novel cephalosporin solvates. 3 Hydroxy 3 cephems and the corresponding sulfoxides have been described as intermediates in the chemical conversion of penicillins to cephalosporins substituted directly at C 3 with halo, alko or other functional groups. Tsuji disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,079,181 the preparation of 3 hydroxy3 cephems from the penicillin sulfoxide derived bicyclic thiazolineazetidinones U.S. Patent No.3,705,892 . 3 Hydroxy 3 cephems have also been prepared by ozonolysis of the corresponding 3 exo me thy lenecephams and penicillin sulfoxlde derived 3 exomethylenecepham sulfoxides U.S. Patent No.4,052,387 as described by Chauvette in U.S. PatentNos. 3,917,587 and 4,060,688. Also Hatfield recently described the reduction of 3 exomethylenecepham and 3 hyd oxy cephem sulfoxides to the corresponding sulfides using acetyl bromide as 2 reducing agent.The preparation of 3 halocephems and 3 hydroxycephem 2 hers from 3 hydroxycephems has been disclosed by Chauvette in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,925,372 and 3,917,587 respectively. A clinically significant cephalosporin antibiotic which is prepared from 3 hydroxycephem intermediates is 7 D 2 amino 2 phenylacetamido 3 chloro 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid. This invention is directed to crystalline acetic acid, propionic acid, methylene chloride and methanol solvates of 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenoxyacetamino 3 hydroxy 3 cephem 4 carboxylate and the corresponding sulfoxide. The discovery of the present solvates allows for facile isolation and purification of 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenoxyacetamido 3 hydroxy 3 cephem 4 carboxylate and its l oxide. The present invention is directed to 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenoxyacetamido 3 hydroxy 3 cephem4 carboxylate solvates of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein n is 1 or 0 and X is CH3COOH, CH3CH2COOH or CH3OH when n is 1, and X is CH3COOH, CH3CH2COOH or 1 2 CH2C12 when n is 0. The acetic acid solvates, a preferred embodiment of the present invention, contain 1 molar eauivalent of acetic acid for each mole of 3 hydroxycephem. They are prepared simply by adding acetic acid to solutions containing 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenoxy acetamido 3 hydroxy 3 cephem 4 carboxylate or its 1 oxide. Depending, of course, on the concentration of the 3 hydroxycephem in solution and the particular solvent being used, the acetic acid solvate will crystallize spontaneously or it can be caused to crystallize by using conventional crystallization techniques such as lowering the solution temperature, adding an anti solvent or seeding with crystals of the desired solvate or by using any combination of these crystallization techniques. The crystalline acetic acid solvates are isolated by filtration. Solvents from which the acetic acid solvates of the present invention can be crystallized are generally those organic solvents in which the 3 hydroxycephem sulfoxide is soluble. Suitable solvents include halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, ethylene dichlorie, and 1,1,2trichloroethane cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane and amazes such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide. Alternatively the acetic acid solvates can be isolated from acetic acid itself.Anti solvents for crystallizing the present acetic acid solvates from water immiscible solutions are lower aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane or petroleum ethers . Water can be employed advantageously in crystallizing the present acetic acid solvates from water miscible solvents such as dimethylformamide or acetic acid. The solutions from which the present acetic acid solvates are isolated can be reaction mixtures in which the 3 hydroxycephem sulfoxide has been prepared or such solutions can be prepared by simply dissolving the 3 hydroxy 3 cephem sulfoxide , usually in an impure state, in the desired solvent for the purpose of purification by crystallization as the acetic acid solvate. The acetic acid solvate of 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenoxyacetamido 3 hydroxy 3 cephem 4 carboxylate l oxide which crystallized from acetic acid water had a melting point of 138 140 C. The propionic acid solvates of the present invention are prepared, crystallized and isolated following procedures analogous to those described above for the acetic acid solvates with the exception, of course, of substituting propionic acid for acetic acid.The propionic acid solvate of 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenoxy acetamido 3 hydroxy 3 cephem 4 carboxylate which crystallized from a methylene chloride propionic acid mixture had a melting point of 89 910C. while the corre sponging 3 hydroxycephem sulfoxide propionic acid solvate from dimethylformamide water propionic acid melted at 149 150 C. The methylene chloride solvate of the present invention contains .5 molar equivalents of methylene chloride for each mole of 3 hydroxy 3 cephem ester.It is prepared typically by adding an anti solvent such as hexane to methylene chloride solutions of 4 nit obenzyl 7 phenoxyacetamido 3 hydroxy 3 cephem4 carboxylate to the cloud point with subsequent cooling and optional seeding of the solution. Characteristic of each of the aforedescribed solvates is the fact that vacuum drying, even at elevated temperatures 30 500C , fails to destroy the solvate. Heating the solvates to their fusion point will however free the bound solvent. The methanol solvate of 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenoxyacetamido 3 hydroxy 3cephem 4 carboxylate l oxide contains 1 molar equivalent of methanol for each mole of 3 hydroxycephem sulfoxide. It is prepared simply by slurrying a sample of the aforedescribed acetic acid solvate or propionic acid solvate of 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenoxyacetamido 3 hydroxy 3cephem 4 carboxylate l oxide in methanol for about 2 3 hours at room temperature. This methanol solvate is a weaker solvate than the corresponding acetic acid or propionic acid solvates. That is, vacuum drying of the methanol solvate at 30 500C for about 12 to 24 hours provides an anhydrous, unsolvated sample of the 3 hydroxycephem sulfoxide. Thus, an impure sample of 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenoxyacetamido3 hydroxy 3 cephem 4 carboxylate l oxide can be purified by first crystallizing it as its acetic acid or propionic acid solvate, preparing the methanol solvate by slurrying the acid solvate with methanol, and vacuum drying the methanol solvate to the anhydrous, unsolvated 3 hydroxycephem sulfoxide. The preparation of 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenoxy acetamido 3 hydroxy 3 cephem 4 carboxylate and its l oxide are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,044,002 and 4,060,688 respectively. U.S. Patents 4,079,181, 3,917,587, 3,925,372 and 3,917,588 further describe the preparation of these compounds and their conversion to antibiotic compounds.
