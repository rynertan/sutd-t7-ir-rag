# Journal bearing assemblies.

## Abstract
A journal bearing assembly includes a bearing sleeve 18 which is rotatable within a stationary housing 22 , and within which a shaft 12 is rotatably borne. One end of the sleeve 18 bears against a stationary shoulder 24 a movable annu lar retainer 26 is urged against the other end of the sleeve 18 by a spring 28 . This spring bias does not prevent rota tion of the sleeve 18 , but limits its speed to a relatively low value, compared with the speed of the shaft 12 for exam ple, with the shaft turning at 60,000 rpm, the sleeve might turn at 200 to 300 rpm.
