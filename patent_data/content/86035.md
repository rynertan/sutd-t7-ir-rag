# Process for the separation of ortho aromatic isomers by selective adsorption.

## Abstract
An improved process for separating ortho aromatic isomers from a feed stream containing a mixture of aroma tics by contacting the feed stream with a bed of the crystalline aluminosilicate adsorbent CSZ 1. The adsorbed ortho aromatic isomer is removed from the adsorbent by desorption.
