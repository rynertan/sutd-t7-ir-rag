## Description
Substituted benzoic acid esters, compositions containing them combinations thereof with photoinitiators and methods of making cured plastics comDositions using them This invention relates to substituted benzoic acid esters, and in particular to their use as photoactivators, to photocurable compositions containing them as photoactivators, to combinations of such photoactivators and photoinitiators and to their use in photocuring resins especially pigmented resins and in particular to resins pigmented with titanium dioxide. Photoactivators are compounds, usually organic compounds, which form synergistic combinations with photo initiators in the photocuring of ethylenically unsaturated resins. In the photocuring of such resins the photo initiator is a compound which will absorb light energy from the curing radiation to give an energetic species which can start a chain reaction to cross link and thus cure the resin. It is believed that photoactivators take part in the chain by having a proton abstracted by the energetic species of the photoinitiator to produce a free radical which can subsequently initiate cross linking. Most photo initiators in current use are ketones or ketone derivatives. Typical examples are acetophenone, benzophenone, benzil, benzoin, xanthone, thioxanthone and substituted forms and derivatives of these compounds. 2 Substituted thioxanthones, especially 2 chlorothioxanthone 2 CTX and the 2 alkylthioxanthones are particularly useful where TiO2 pigments are used because they have a photoactive absorption band centred about 38G nm and this is in the transitional region between the lower wavelength end of the high reflectivity and the upper wavelength end of the U.VX absorption band of TiO2. Typically the photoaXctivators in current use are amines and in particular tertiary amines. Typical examples include triethylamine, triethanolamine, methyldiethanolamine, dimethylaniline and morplioline. Recently the use of para dialkylamino benzoic acid and its esters has been suggested in German Offenlegungsschrift No.2458345. One disadvantage of 2 chloro and 2 alkyl thioxanthones is that they are solids. Since in most photocuring systems it is preferred to avoid the introduction of solvent which would have to be subsequently removed from the system, those photoinitiators have to be milled into the composition to be photocured. The lower members of the homologous series of para dialkylaminobenzoate esters are also all solids and this constitutes a substantial disadvantage of what would otherwise be very attractive photoactivators. The present invention accordingly provides a compound of the formula EMI2.1 where each R is a methyl or ethyl group and n is 1 or 2. The invention includes the compound 2 n butoxy ethyl 4 dimethylaminobenzoate. The invention also provides a photocurable comp osition comprising a photocurable ethylenically unsaturated compound, a photo initiator and as a photoactivator one or more compounds of the invention. T ne invention further includes a method of making a cured plastics composition which comprises exposing a composition of the invention to a dose of active radiation sufficient to cure The photoinitiators used in this invention are tipically di aryl ketones. This type of photoinitiato is commoly used with photoactivators in particular when used In pigmented resin systems. The simplest diaryl ketones photoinitiators are those of the benzo phenone type, the most commonly used compound being benzophenone Itself.The photoactivators used in the present invention can be used with benzophencne but we have obtained better results from di aryl ketone photoinitiators in which the two aryl groups are linked to give a cyclic ketone. Examples of such ketone photoinitiators include 2 substitued thioxanthones, especielly 2 chloro and 2 alkyl thioxanthenes, dixbenzosuberone and fluoreone. We have found that benzil photonintiators also werk with the photoactivators used in the present invention and for the purposes of this invention we include benzil i. e. 1,2 diphenylethane 1,2 rne and substituted benzils, but rot functional derivatives of the oxo groups, within the term di aryl ketone. We believe that this is well understood by those skilled in the art. The invention includes a composition comprising a photoinitiator and as a photoactivator a compound of the formula EMI4.1 where R and n are as defined above. It is a particular advantage of the compounds used as photoactivators in the present invention that they are liquids not only at ambient temperatures but at temperatures down to OOC, and that at least the most commonly used 2 alkyithioxanthones, 2 isopropylthioxanthone and 2 tertiarybutylthioxanthone are readily soluble, e.g. up to 40 g. per 100 g. ester and 2 chlorothioxanthone has a significant solubility sufficient that in curing resins the necessary 2 CTX can be completely dissolved in the ester.Accordingly, in a preferred aspect the invention further provides a photoinitiatorphotoactivator combination comprising a compound of the formula EMI4.2 where X is a chlorine atom giving 2 CTX or an alkyl group giving the 2 alkylTX s , preferably a C1 to C10 alkyl group, more preferably a branched chain C3 to C7 alkyl group, optimally an isopropyl or tertiary butyl group in solution in a compound or a mixture of compounds of the formula EMI5.1 where R and n are as defined above. The compounds of the invention can be used as photoactivators ir. the photocuring of plastics compositions. For example, they are particularly useful in the manufavture of cured thin plastics films especially printing inks. The photoactivators are useful generally in the photocuring of resins containing cross linkable ethylenically unsaturated compounds. Typically the ethylenic unsaturations are provided by including oligomeric olefins or unsaturated polyesters, e.g. those made including an unsaturated acid such as maleic, fumaric or itaconic acid. The unsaturation may be introduced into the resin either by copolymerising a suitable ethylenically unsaturated monomer with the other componets of the resin or by rnixing a separately formed polymer contacting ethylenic unsaturations with a polymer containing ethylenic unsaturations. The choice in any particular case will depend upon the desired properties in the end product.Suitable polymer resins are acrylic resins, acrylated aromatic or aliphatic polyurethane resins, epoxy acrylate resins and styrene polyester resins. The amount of photoactivator used depends on the nature of the resins, the amount and nature of the pigment and the particular photoinitiator used. Typically to ensure adequate photoactivation the amount used will be from 0.2 to 5 , preferably 1 to 3 , by weight of the composition. The amount of photo initiator depends on the particular photoinitiator employed, but will typically be in the range 0.1 to 5 by weight of the composition. When 2 CTX or 2 alkylTX is used as the photo initiator, the amount used will usually be in the lower part of this range, e.g. 0.2 to 1, preferably 0.2 to 0.5. These figures represent practical levels of photoactivator and photoinitiator in TiO2 pigmented systems even at high pigment levels, e.g. up to 50 by weight of the composition.When other pigments are used the photo initiator will be selected accordingly but this is regarded as within the skill in the art.The ratio between the photoactivator and photoinitiator is not believed to be especially critical but is generally in the range 1 4 to 100 1. Especially when 2 CTX is the photoinitiator it is preferable that this ratio is fairly high, e.g. in the range 4 1 to 20 1 because the use of large quantities of 2 CTX tends to produce a yellow colour in the cured resin. The photoactivators used in the present invention are sufficiently potent that such low levels, both relatively and absolutely, of 2 CTX can still produce good results. Where, as is preferred, the photoactivator photoinitiator combination is a solution of 2 CTX or 2 alkylTX in the benzoate ester, the amount of this combination used will typically be from 1 to 5 by weight of the composition. The solution will typically contain from 1 to 20 by weight of the photoinitiator. However, where 2 chlorothioxanthone is the photo initiator the concentration will generally be in the range of 1 to 5 because of the rather limited solubility of the commercially available forms of 2 CTX. Technical grade 2 CTX available at the present time typically contains about 65 by weight of 2 chlorothioxanthone and about 35 by weight of 3 chlorothioxanthone which is somewhat less active that the 2 isomer. This material is soluble in 2 n butoxy ethyl Erdimethylaminobenzoate to about 5 W w. The resins used in the invention are generally photocured by exposure to ultra violet or short wavelength visible light, the precise wavelength or range of wavelengths depending on the pigment and photoinitiator used. Where, as is preferred in the present invention, the pigment is TiO2, the light used will generally be predominantly ultraviolet light in the wavelength range 350 to 400 nm. For other pigments other wavelengths are appropriate as is known in the art. The time of exposure depends inter alia on the intensity of the radiation, the thickness of the resin to be cured and the nature and concentration of the photoinitiator and photoactivator. We have found that in the present invention exposures of less than i Sec. using using a single lamp 80 W cm manicure oven for thin films of TiO2 pigmentd,resin are adequate to give hard 6H pencil hardness layer of cured pigmented resin.The use of thicker layers of resin or lower radiation intensity will generally require longer exposure times. The compounds of the present invention have activity as photoactivators which is comparable to that of known photoactivators such as the photoactivators described in our U.K. Patent Specification No. Application No. 52202 76 . The low melting points of the compounds of the invention provides a particular advantage in that in combination with their solubility for the normal photo initiators it enables the user to add the active ingredients in a liquid form after the milling of the pigment into the resin so reducing wastage. The paradimethylaminobenzoic acid esters whose use as photoactivators is described in German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2458345 have, as a class, substantially higher melting points than the compounds of the present invention. Typically they are solid rather than liquid at ambient temperature. Their generally solid nature makes them substantially more difficult to compound with resins than the compounds and compositions of the present invention. The possibility of incorporating pigments into the resin products has been mentioned above. The invention is applicable to cured resin products containing no pigment and to those containing pigments which may be white e.g. titanium dioxide or coloured. The invention is also applicable to products which are clear but are coloured by containing a soluble dyestuff. Of course, where pigmented or dyed products are being produced the precise conditions of operation may need to be adjusted in order to take account of the possibility of dispersion or adsorption of the curing radiation by the pigment of dyestuff. This is a problem that is well understood in the art and no particular difficulty arises in dealing with it in the present invention. The compounds of the invention can be made by methods which are known or analagous to methods known per se for similar compounds. It is an additional advantage of the compounds of the invention that they can readily be made from compounds which are already commercially available. The following reaction scheme illustrate some ways in which the compounds of. the invention can be made.
