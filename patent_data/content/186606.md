# Fluid actuator devices.

## Abstract
A fluid actuator comprises a rigid housing 2 having a port 10, 12 for introducing pressurized fluid, a reciprocating member 4 disposed within the housing 2 , and drive means within the housing 2 for driving the reciprocating member 4 in the forward and return directions. The drive means comprises a folded tubular hose section 6a, 6b disposed within the housing 2 and having one end in communication with the port 10, 12 and the opposite end closed such that introducing pressurized fluid into the hose section 6a, 6b via the port 10, 12 causes the hose to open its folds and thereby to drive the reciprocating member 4 in the forward direction.
