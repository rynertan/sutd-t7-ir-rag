# System for controlling the clutch torque of an electromagnetic clutch for vehicles.

## Abstract
A system is described for controlling clutch torque for a vehicle having a transmission, and an electromagnetic clutch 1 provided between an engine and the transmission. The system comprises an engine speed sensor 16, a computing unit 19 for measuring the speed of a driven member 9 of the electromagnetic clutch 1, an accelerator pedal switch 17 for detecting the acceleration of the vehicle and for producing an acceleration signal, and a comparator 20 for comparing the measuring engine speed with the measuring speed of the driven member 9 and for producing an output when both the speeds substantially coincide with each other. The system has an AND gate 21 responsive to the acceleration signal and the output for producing a clutch engaging signal, to thereby engage the electromagnetic clutch 1.
