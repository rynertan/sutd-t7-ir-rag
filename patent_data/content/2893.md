# Growth promotion means for ruminant animals and method for its production.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the use of aplasmomycin, boromycin and acylated and hydrogenated derivatives thereof for modifying rumen metabolism in domestic ruminant animals, by reducing the proportion of methane formed, and increasing the proportion of propionate at the expense of methane and or acetate. This modification of rumen metabolism is believed to improve growth in ruminant animals. The disclosure also describes compositions which may be used in the claimed method, an improved process for the production of aplasmomycin, and novel analogs of aplasmomycin and boromycin together with processes for their manufacture.
