# Electronic, variable speed engine governor.

## Abstract
A speed regulator or governor for an engine. The gover nor utilizes the approximate digital equivalent of a lead and a lag feedback network in combination with a stored, digital, nonlinear look up table, or other nonlinear means, to control engine speed. The governor controls the engine at different fixed engine speeds in response to demand, or at continu ously variable engine speeds in response to demand.
