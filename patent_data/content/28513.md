# A method of demolition and method of preparing a demolition agent.

## Abstract
A demolition agent which acts by means of expansive stress generated upon hydration is prepared by calcining limestone at 1300 to 1600 C to produce a hard burned quick lime whose crystal size is 10 to 100 micron, pulverizing the resulting hard burned quick lime to 1500 to 5000 cmÂ² g Blaine , mixing 5 to 70 parts by weight of a hydraulic material to 30 to 95 parts by weight of the hard burned quick lime and furthermore adding 0.1 to 5 parts by weight of a modifying agent to 100 parts by weight of the mixture of the powdery hard burned quick lime and the hydraulic material. The demolition agent is used as an aqueous slurry which is filled into holes of a brittle material to demolish the brittle material by means of expansive stress generated upon hydra tion.
