# Silane perylene dyes, composite pigments obtainable therefrom, and processes for preparing the same.

## Abstract
There are described silane diimidic tetracarboxylic perylene dyes, composite pigments obtainable therefrom by grafting onto an inorganic substrate or support, and processes for preparing the same. The dyes have the general formula CHEM in which R is the residue of a silane group of formula CHEM wherein n is 3, 4 or 5 q is 0 or 1 p and m are integers such that when q is 0, p is 3 and m is 0, 1, 2 or 3, and when q is 1, p is 2 and m is 0, 1 or 2 R2 is an alkyl C1 C4 group or a phenyl group and R3 is an alkoxyl C1 C2 group and in which R, may be the same as R or may be an alkyl C1 C6 group, a cycloalkyl group, or a phenyl group optionally substituted by one or more halogens or alkyl or alkoxyl C1 C6 groups. The dyes and the composite pigments obtained from said dyes are utilized in paints, air and stove enamels, in the pigmentation of plastics materials and in printing links.
