## Description
FABRICATED BLADE WITH SPANWISE COOLING PASSAGES FOR GAS TURBINE This invention relates to a gas turbine blade, and in particular to a fabricated blade with spanwise cooling passages. Many typical gas turbines for power plant and similar use have up to four rows of rotating turbine blades. At current levels of turbine inlet temperature, only the first and second rows of blades require cooling.This is currently accomplished in gas turbine engines made by the assignee of this application by providing spanwise holes which pass through the root and air foil of the blades. The root portion of the hole is usually larger in diameter than the air foil portion because the root portion is mainly performing a coolant supply function to the passages in the air foil portion of the blade and it is desirable to do the supply function with as little pressure loss as possible. One way to provide the coolant holes is to drill the air foil portion from tip to hub to intersect the root portion, which is drilled from the inner blade serration toward the blade hub. If the blades are cast blades, an alternate manufacturing approach is to cast the holes in situ using cores which are subsequently removed. With either manufacturing approach it is very difficult to incorporate holes in air foils which are not straight line. With current machines, the design limitation of requiring straight line holes has not introduced a problem. The air foil shape of the first row of rotating blades has been such that straight air foil cooling holes can readily be incorporated throughout the blade. For the second row of blades, the air foil shape has been such that it is not possible to pass a straight hole near the leading edge and sometimes the trailing edge. However, the second row gas environment has been low enough in temperature that very little cooling is needed at the leading and trailing edges of the blade and the holes do not need to be very close to these edge extremities. However, as turbine inlet temperatures increase, it will likely bye necessary with future gas turbines to do more cooling at the second row extremities and also to cool the blades in the third row and eventually the fourth row.Particularly with the third and fourth row blades, a substantial aerodynamic compromise would be required to make it possible to cool the airflow tith straight line holes. These blades twist and taper substantially from hub to tip and also usually contain curvatures in the spanwise direction to minimize aerodynamic losses. The aim of this invention is to provide an arrangement for turbine blades of complex air foil shapes which are provided with spanwise directed cooling passages which are not necessarily straight and therefore avoid any increase in aerodynamic losses due to compromise of the aerodynamic design. According to the present invention, a gas turbine blade comprises a root part and an air foil part, the air foil part having cambers which change from a deep camber adjacent said root part to a relatively shallow camber at the air foil extremity said air foil part being progressively twisted and tapered between said root part and said extremity the air foil part having a chord line at said air foil extremity which is angularly displaced relative to the chord line of said air foil part adjacent said root part said blade comprising a two piece structure having facing parting surfaces in the air foil part along camber shaped lines, at least one of the pieces of said two plece structure having a plurality of spanwiseextending grooves open to a corresponding plurality of grooves extending through said root part, said root part having facing parting surfaces adjacent said air foil part along the camber lines of the air foil thereat, said two pieces of said two piece structure being bonded together in clamshell fashion said changing cambers and chord lines, and said twisted and tapered configuration, resulting in a contoured shape of the air foil part precluding straight line spanwise directed internal passages throughout at least a part of the air foil part requiring passages for the flow of cooling air. Conveniently, the turbine blade is of two piece construction, each piece including an air foil part and a root part with facing parting surfaces of the two parts preferably following the camber lines throughout the air foil and with the root part facing parting surfaces adjacent the air foil portion following the camber lines of the air foil at the juncture of the root and air foil and with at least one of the pieces of the two piece structure having a plurality of spanwise extending grooves extending throughout the air foil and through the root part, the two pieces of the blade being bonded together in clamshell fashion with the grooves in the finished blade providing spanwise directed internal cooling passages. This arrangement permits the provision of the cooling passages in parts of the air foil which have a contour precluding straight line spanwise directed cooling passages. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a top view of a turbine blade with the extremity or tip of the air foil part of the blade being closest to the viewer Figure 2 is a partly broken, fragmentary isometric view of a blade Figure 3 is a fragmentary isometric view of an upstream part of one side of the root of the blade and Figures 4 7 are fragmentary sectional views corresponding to those views taken along the lines IV IV,V V, VI VI, and VII VII of Figure 1 and illustrating the successive change in angles of the passages in the root section at successive positions from the leading toward the trailing edge of the blade. The particular blade example for purposes of description herein is a third row blade as currently used on a large gas turbine currently identified as the W501 by applicantls assignee. While only a single blade is illustrated, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a series of these individual blades are fastened by their root portions to the circumference of a rotor disc in the turbine in the conventional fashion. In Figure 1, the root section 10 has a top or radially outwardly facing platform 12 into which the air foil section of the blade 14, merges and projects radially outwardly or upwardly to terminate in the upper tip edge 16 of the blade, The base or hub of the air foil at the platform 12 is relatively thick throughout most of its length from the leading edge 18 to its trailing edge 20 as indicated by the opposite edge lines 22 and 22a of the hub part of the air foil The camber of the hub is relatively deep as indicated by the camber dashline 24 for the hub. In contrast to the hub, the extremity or tip 16 of the air foil is relatively thin throughout its length from the leading to the trailing edges 26 and 28 at the extremity as indicated by the opposite face lines 30 and 30a and the camber at the tip is relatively shallow as indicated by the line 32. Thus, there is a significant taper of the air foil from the hub to its tip. Finally, the air foil has a significantly twisted contour as may be seen by the angular displacement of the chord line 34 of the tip relative to the chord line 36 of the hub. It is this twisted and tapered configuration, along with the differences in camber of the hub and tip, which preclude spanwise directed, straight line passages throughout much of the air foil part of the blade. It is the aim of the invention to provide a blade arrangement in which internal spanwise passages through the air foil and root are provided for cooling air even though they may not be provided with conventional practice as outlined in the background of the invention. Accordingly, the blade is comprised of two initially separate parts with grooves being provided in a facing surface of at least one of the parts and the parts are then placed together in a term clamshell fashion and bonded by any suitable means such as diffusion bonding. InFigure 1, the parting surfaces at the air foil tip follow the camber line 32 while the parting surfaces at the hub of the air foil and at the platform 12 of the root 10 follow the camber line 24. Referring now to Figure 2 in which a part of the one piece of the two piece blade structure is broken away, a plurality of spanwise directed grooves 38 are provided in a facing surface of one part of the blade before the two parts of the blade are assembled together and bonded. When the two parts of the blade are assembled and bonded, these grooves, of course, form the internal cooling passages for the blade. As shown in Figure 3, the root 10 may be provided with the conventional inverted fir tree design for fastening the roots to the rotor of the turbine. Since the base of the root is significantly narrower than the width of the platform 12, and because of the relatively deep camber 24 with the grooves in the one parting surface being spaced across a significant extent of the platform width, a number of the grooves 38a in the root extend at angles as shown to translate to the root centerline at the base of the root.This angular disposition of the grooves 38a in the root at different locations is also readily perceivable fromFigures 4 7. While the grooves 38 have been shown as being provided in only one facing surface of one part of the blade, it will be apparent that in accordance with the principles of the invention the grooves could be provided in both facing surfaces of the parts to form passages which are circular in cross section rather than semicircular, or could have any other desirable shape. Further, the grooves in the root can be made larger in cross section than the grooves in the air foil for the purpose of reducing air flow resistance in the root passages. Depending upon whether the blade is forged or cast, the grooves and passages may be either machined or formed during casting. Further, the passages in the blade may be tapered throughout a part or the whole of the blade, or have different cross sectional areas at different span points. Although the embodiment described above employs blade halves with facing parting surfaces following the camber lines throughout the air foil, it will be apparent that a division other than the camber line could be employed.
