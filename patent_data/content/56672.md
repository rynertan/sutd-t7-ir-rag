# Buoy for measuring wave slopes.

## Abstract
Buoy provided with a mainly circular disc shaped body 1 having a mainly horizontal lower surface 4 and protrud ing downwardly from said lower surface a central circular protrusion 3 having a smaller diameter than said lower surface and suchlike dimensioned that with a horizontal current the pressure deviation caused by said protrusion generates by its working on said lower surface a tilting moment opposite and at least equal to the tilting moment caused by the protrusion itself.
