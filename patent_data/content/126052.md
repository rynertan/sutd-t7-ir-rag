# Method for indicating slipping of a driving rotative element.

## Abstract
Method for indicating slipping between a surface and a driving element 10B engaging said surface at a circular peripheral surface. The periods of one revolution of said element and a free running rotative element 10F engaging said surface at a circular peripheral surface, or parts or multiples thereof are sensed and compared to provide a first signal S₁ , representing an existing difference. The period sensed for the free running rotative element and the immediately preceding period for said element are compared to provide a second signal S₃ representing an existing acceleration of the rotative element. The first and second signals are compared and indication is effected in depen dence on the relation of magnitude of the signals.
