## Description
This invention lies in the field of The vital functions of highly developed organisms are closely dependent on the internal aqueousmedium and on the maintenance in it of extreme constance of chemical and physical properties. It has long been recognized that all animal intracellular and extracellular body fluids contain inorganicelectrolytes, and that these electrolytes are involved in, and profoundly influence, various life processes.Attempts to make artificial electrolyte fluids which may bathe tissues or be administered to the human bloodstream have been known since about 1880, and, although modern analytical tools and procedures haveclarified compositional details of blood electrolytes, the use of various aqueous electrolyte solutions for Those inorganic electrolytes characteristically found in normal human blood serum at respectiveconcentration levels above about 1 millimolar per liter of concentration are shown below in Table I. Also, forcomparative purposes, in Table I are shown some representative compositions of various aqueouselectrolyte solutions that have been previously prepared and used for Contemporarily, a large number of different aqueous electrolyte solutions are prepared, sold incommerce, and used as Even a cursory examination of Table I will confirm the medical dicta that plasma is an unmakablesolution . The solutions listed in Table I illustrate this belief. The essential problem is that plasma contains, in addition to major inorganic electrolytes, trace quantities of various electrolytes plus various metabolitesincluding plasma proteins. In practice, it has not been possible to construct synthetically a replication ofplasma because of its complexity. Blood, extracellular fluid, and even plasma can be regarded as tissues. In most prior art electrolyte solutions, the concentration of chloride anions Cl From Table I, it is clear that the Krebs Serum substitute Krebs, H.A. An alternative to Krebs selection of anions came about at the same time. In 1949, the use of highconcentrations of acetate as a metabolizable organic anion was advocated Mudge G.H., Mannining J.A.,Gilman A. In addition to the above organic anions, the current reference work Facts and Comparisons indicatesvarious commercial electrolyte fluids which contain lactate anion. All of the prior art electrolyte solutions with or without nutrients as exemplified in Table I are nowbelieved to lead to undesirable and pathological consequences particularly through extended usage. Asregards acetate, editorials recently appearing in the Krebs choice of glutamate In addition to the use of d,l lactate, gluconate, fumarate, glutamate, pyruvate, and citrate anions incurrent commercially available prior art electrolyte fluids, and wherein such anions are typically employed atlevels above those found in the plasma or serum of healthy humans, many such prior art commercialfluids also employ high levels of nonionic metabolites, such as fructose and glycerol, which induce separateredox state and phosphorylation potential abnormalities in phosphorylation potential with rapid destruction ofliver purine nucleotides and their release into blood sometimes leading to renal shutdown due to uric aciddeposition in the kidneys see Woods H.F., Eggleston L.V. and Krebs H.A. In addition to failing to solve the anion gap problem or to provide a normal milliequivalent ratio ofsodium cation to chloride anions without causing profound and adverse physiological effects includingdisruption of normal redox state and normal phosphorylation potential , many prior art aqueous electrolytesolutions for Mammalian systems normally operate at temperatures between about 37 38 C where, by common thermodynamic convention, neutral pH is taken to be about 7 at 25 C. It is clear that changes in pH, thenegative log 10 of H The pH of human plasma is normally maintained by the human body in the range from about 7.35 to7.45 while the pH of human cellular cytoplasm is about 7.2 see Veech et al in The major chemical system maintaining body pH within this narrow normal range is the CO Even though pH is thus seen to be a critical factor in mammalian blood, many commercial electrolytesolutions as administered have pH values which deviate substantially from normal. Others give excessiveCl The compositions and methods disclosed herein overcome the above indicated prior artproblems. These compositions and methods employ definite ratios of bicarbonate All previous electrolyte solutions, and plasma substitutes, induce severe and measurable pathogenicabnormalities and no prior art electrolyte solution or plasma substitute has both a employed at least one ofthe three mixture pairs of this invention and b achieve a normal Na milliequivalent ratio as taught herein.Thus, for example, the Krebs Henseleit solution contains the HCO The making of a Krebs Henseleit electrolyte solution or other prior art electrolyte solution and theincorporation thereinto of a mixture of L lactate and pyruvate anions, or of a mixture of D betahydroxybutyrateand acetoacetate anions did not, and could not, result in the making of an electrolyte solutionwherein the anion gap problem was overcome or wherein the milliequivalent ratio of sodium cations tochloride anions was normalized , in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, because each ofsuch resulting solutions would still contain excessive chloride anions and so would inevitably causehyperchloremia if and when used in human or mammalian therapy. In general summary, the prior art describes a series of electrolyte solutions typically of about 270 320milliosmoles or higher comprised of a 1 to 4 metallic cations of sodium, potassium, magnesium, andcalcium in amounts greater than 0.5 mmol l, b 1 to 5 inorganic anions of chloride plus also HPO US A 3993751 Zinke , and other prior publications of which US A 3993751 is typical, discloses aphysiologically compatible aqueous salt solution for mammalian administration which contains bicarbonateanions but not nutrient and has CO US A 3676553 Reynolds discloses an injectable aqueous solution which contains bicarbonate anionsbut no dissolved CO Other prior publications include US A 4308255, US A 3970750 and US A 3993750, Physician s DeskReference, 28th edition 1974 page 1257, EP A 0177614 and WO A 85 01657. The last two documentswere published after the priority date of the present application. The present invention provides salt solutions as defined in the claims of thisspecification, to which reference should now be made. This invention thus provides electrolytes for use in accomplishing electrolyte and water therapy whilesimultaneously normalizing blood composition in a mammal including man by introducing in a physiologicallyeffective amount by any means, including parenterally, intravenously, intraarterially, intramuscularly,intravascularly, and the like, by dialysis, or orally, and the like into such mammal an aqeuous solutionwherein There are also disclosed ectrolytes of the class indicated wherein physiologically normal concentrationsof the diavalent cations Mg When used for mammalian administration, such a solution One first class of such solutions characteristically utilizes contains an inorganic class of anionscomprised of chloride and bicarbonate. These solutions have a physiological pH which is broadly in therange from 5 to 9, and preferably in the range from 6.9 to 8.6, and more preferably in the range from 7.35to 7.45, and most preferably is 7.4 for human use . Dissolved carbon dioxide is also present in thesesolutions. When administered, these solutions not only tend to maintain the treated mammal s normal blood and plasma ratio of sodium to chloride, but also tend to set regulate the treated mammal s blood plasma pH at a normalized value. In addition the treated mammal s redox state and phosphorylationpotential tend to be normalized. Another second class preferred of such solutions characteristically utilizes contains chloride anionsand a class of carboxylate anionic mixture couples comprised of at least one member from the groupconsisting of a a mixture of I lactate Another third class more preferred of such solutions characteristically utilizes contains both chlorideanions, and bicarbonate carbon dioxide mixture, as in such first class of solutions, but also utilizes contains such class of carboxylate anionic couples, as in such second class of solutions. Whenadministered, these solutions achieve the above indicated effects obtained from the use of such first classof solutions and the above indicated effects obtained from the use of such second class of solutions. The specified milliequivalent ratio of sodium to chloride in normal mammalian blood generally isbelieved to be in the range from 1.24 1 to 1.47 1. In the case of a normal human adult, this range is nowbelieved to extend based on published information from 1.24 1 to 1.45 1 and preferably from 1.33 1 to1.42 1 and most preferably from 1.36 1 to 1.42 1. These ratios of Na In using these couples, the important factor is the ratio of the concentration of product reactant seeEqns O, 1,2,3,4.5 7 hereinbelow . The absolute concentration becomes important in affecting the chemicalactivity of water e.g. the osmotic pressure . The total quantity, or sum sigma , of the couple d betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate present in a solution of this invention can range from 0.1 to 465mMoles liter of solution. However, in routine situations, the quantity of the couple commonly ranges from 0.1to 25 to 60 mmoles liter. The ratio of bicarbonate milliequivalents per liter to dissolved carbon dioxide milliequivalents per liter ina solution of this invention can range from 0.1 1 to 55 0.1 and preferably 11 1 to 24 1. More preferably, suchtotal ranges from 10 to 45 mmol l and such ratio ranges from 18 1 to 26 1, and still more preferably suchtotal ranges from 23 to 35 mmol l while such ratio ranges from 19 1 to 21 1. A ratio of 19.95 for HCO The ratio of I lactate anion milliequivalents per liter to pyruvate anion milliequivalents per literin a solution can range from 20 1 to 1 1. Preferably, such total quantity ranges from 0.5 to10 mmol l and such ratio ranges from 3 1 to 15 1, and more preferably such total quantity ranges from 2 to8 mmol l while such ratio ranges from 5 1 to 12 1. The ratio of d betahydroxybutyrate anion milliequivalents per liter to acetoacetate milliequivalentsper liter in a solution of this invention ranges from 6 1 to 0.5 1. Preferably, such total rangesfrom 1 to 10mmol l and such ratio ranges from 4 1 to 1 1, and more preferably such total ranges from 2 to5mmol l while such ratio ranges from 3 1 to 1.5 1. By the term milliequivalent ratio as sometimes used herein, reference is had the ratio of milliequivalentsper liter of one substance to milliequivalents per liter of another substance in an aqueousmedium. One of the three near equilibrium couples discloses herein thebicarbonate By the term safe entry point as used herein reference is generally had to a metabolite which, in livingtissue or cells Further, each such above described near equilibrium couple exhibits a distribution orpermeability between intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid such that the ratio of the concentrations in,respectively, intracellular fluid to extracellular fluid ranges from 1.0 1 to 1.5 1 in most all mammalian cells. These respective three pairs of permeant monocarboxylate near equilibrium couples are unique amongmetabolites in being osmotically neutral in respect to the water in intracellular and extracellular space.Administration of these three couples, as their appropriate cationic salts individually or in some combinationwith one another as taught herein necessarily results in no net change in the distribution of water betweenintracellular and extracellular spaces in most tissues. By administration of varying ratios of these couples,however, the physician may control the distribution of water by varying the redox state and hence thephosphorylation state as described in equation 7 herein below. Osmotically active substances incorporatedwith the solutions of this invention preferably should each constitute a safe entry point. For example,glucose above 13mmol l is higher than ever occurs under normal physiological conditions in a healthy man.Use of glucose above 13mmol l as in the widely used 5 glucose solution as a calorie source is, apartfrom consideration of the source of pathology, and apart from the caroboxylate couples, considered hereinto be an acceptable source of calories. The extreme ability of the mammalian body to regulate its glucosemetabolism makes it far to be preferred over other possibly nonionics, such as fructose or glycerol, whichenter the metabolic system in an uncontrolled manner causing pathologic changes such as are alreadyreferenced, and so such are not safe entry points. Characteristically, a solution used in the practice of this invention contains from 1 to 2400 millimolesper liter of sodium cations, but, in routine situations, commonly ranges from 120 to 170 mmol l and morepreferably from 129 to 163.5mmol l and most preferably from 136 to 145mmol l. In addition, a solution contains sufficient chloride anions to produce a milliequivalent ratio of sodiumcations to chloride anions in the range above defined. Optionally, in addition to sodium, a solution of this invention can contain one or more of the followingadditional metallic cations each in a respective quantity as below indicated Optionally a solution of this invention can have additionally incorporated dissolved therein 0 to about2400 millimoles per liter of at least one osmotically active substance which is preferably metabolizable andpreferably substantially nonionic including zwiterionic .A solution used in the practice of this invention is further characterized by generally having Examples of usable osmotically active substantially nonionic substances include glucose, glycerol,fructose, sorbitol, and the like. Glucose is presently most preferred. As hereinbelow explained, the solutions of the present invention find use in a widevariety of therapeutic applications, such as in electrolyte and fluid replacement, parenteral nutrition, anddialysis. Various additional objects, aims, purposes, features, advantages, applications,variations and the like will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings of the present specification taken with the claims. This description is based upon best available information including theory known to the inventor. Anymisdescription or the like, if such should exist, is not believed to alter the fundamentally correct basis andevidence supporting the present invention. In biological cells, most reactions are catalyzed by enzymes of which an average cell may have of theorder of 10 Since co enzymes take part in multiple intracellular reaction within a given cellular compartment, thechemical potential of the co enzyme couple becomes of central importance in energy transformation andoxide reductions occurring in living matter. The thermodynamic characteristics of a particular whole set ofoxide reduction reactions is dependent upon the ratio of the free concentrations strictly speaking, theactivities of the free NAD The term redox state as thus used herein can be considered to refer to the oxidation reduction stateof any one or more of the three main pyridine nucleotide couples. Each of these couples are The three pyridine nucleotide couples or pools each achieve different redox potentials because of thechemical energies of the substrates to which they are linked by their respective enzymes since the standardredox potential of NAD The oxidiation of lactate anions to pyruvate anions that is, the loss of 2H In general, the term redox state may also be defined as a ratio of oxidized substrate reducedsubstrate . The half or mid point potential Eh is conventionally measured as a potential in volts relative to astandard hydrogen electrode potential in accordance with the Nernst equation. The mid point potential ofthe NAD In the case of a living cell, a plurality of oxidation reduction reactions occur simultaneously. Undernormal conditions, these reactions occur in a normal healthy cell in a predictable manner. How thesevarious redox states are regulated has just been described in thermodynamic terms. The normal healthycell keeps the redox state of its free cytoplasmic NAD The redox state of the free cytoplasmic NAD In healthy living mammals, the ratio of L lactate Similarly, the redox state of the free mitochondrial NAD The normal ratio of mitochondrial NAD The redox state of the free cytoplasmic NADP While the importance of redox state to the maintenance and normalization of intracellular metabolicprocesses and bioenergetics has long been recognized, there has never been previously, so far as is nowknown, any attempt to regulate or to normalize the redox state in such mammals including especiallyhuman patients receiving intravenous therapy, in patients undergoing dialysis, or in patients receivingparenteral nutrition. The present invention provides compositions and methods for regulating and ornormalizing the redox state in mammals including man treated herewith. Existing electrolyte fluids make no attempt to maintain or normalize cellular redox potentials in any waywhatsoever. In fact, most existing electrolyte fluids actually severely distort or make abnormal the redoxbalance of the cells, resulting in mutliple and definable abnormalities. In this way, existing electrolyte fluidsdistort, such things as, for example, the rate of fat oxidation, the rate of glucose production, the rate of uricacid excretion, the rate of galactose metabolism in milk fed infants, and the like. All of these abnormalitieslead to respectively, accumulation of fat in tissue, such as, for example, liver, production of eitherhyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, gouty crisis, cataracts,and neurological damage. Just as the NAD It is clear that the reaction of oxidative phosphorylation contains both the redox state of mitochondriaand the cytoplasmic phosphorylation potential. While the phosphorylation potential cannot apparently becontrolled directly by addition of ATP and ADP to fluids contacting cells, since these compounds do notpenetrate cell wall, there is, however, another reaction which is in near equilibrium with the cytoplasmic sigma ATP sigma ADP sigma Pi see Veech et al. in Metabolism in any living cell may be considered to be an ordered process whereby H The fundamental process of cell respiration where NADH is oxidized to form heat and energy is calledoxidative phosphorylation. It occurs in cellular organelles called mitochondria in a series of redox reactionscalled the electron transport chain. The mitochondrial electron transport system takes two electrons 2e The phosphorylation potential of living cells can be measured by determining the cellular contents ofthe components of certain metabolites see Veech R.L., In Since on theoretical grounds Veech et al. in Because the cytoplasmic sigma ATP sigma ADP sigma Pi or phosphorylation potential is related tothe cytoplasmic NAD If a simple, reliable chemical means were known and or could be devised to change the intracellularredox state, it would of necessity have to change the other components of the reaction which include thephosphorylation potential and would be of obvious fundamental importance in medicine and in many otherrelated fields of biochemistry, physiology, molecular biology, tissue culture, veterinary medicine, and likeendeavors. Such a chemical means is provided by the teachings of the present invention. As above indicated, a large portion of metabolism is devoted to energy generation which involves theremoval of H Determination of any redox or energy state must always involve a ratio of chemical compounds, oxidized product reduced reactant and oxidized co factor reduced co factor . The overall reaction isthus comprised of two individual redox systems, one of which is oxidized, while the other is reduced. Those enzymes within a cell which are of sufficiently high activity relative to the flux through theenzyme to catalyze a state of near equilibrium are suitable for controlling the redox state. A reaction may beexperimentally determined to be in a state of near equilibrium by measuring the equilibrium constant keq under conditions which approximate those existing within a cell, that is, where the ionic strength I equals0.25, the pH equals 7 to 7.2, the temperature equals 38 C, and the free Mg Various cytoplasmic and mitochondrial NAD linked dehydrogenases appear to be capable of controllingor setting the NAD The near equilibrium redox active metabolite carboxylate couples disclosed herein, specfically, I lactate As indicated above see Table 1 and related text , previous attempts to normalize the sodium tochloride milliequivalent mole ratio of about 1.36 were usually done by adding either d,l lactate In the solutions disclosed herein, one employs at least one of the above indicated three differentnear equilibrium couple mixtures. In each couple mixture, the two member components are employed in adefinite milliequivalent ratio relative to one another Such a ratio is needed in order to control either theplasma pH, or the redox state and consequently the phosphorylation potential , or both. Among the possible mixture couples which could be used, these three couples were selected because,for each couple When blood levels of, respectively, I lactate pyruvate, d betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate, andbicarbonate CO Intracellular concentration of each member of each couple is achieved through the extracellular fluidbecause each of the monovalent anions chosen, namely, I lactate and pyruvate, d betahydroxybutyrate, andaceotacetate, and also bicarbonate, distribute themselves between plasma water, extracellular water, andintracellular water in concentration ratios or gradients which are the inverse of the hydrogen ion concentration , thereby achieving a gradient or ratio of about 1.35 between extracellular and intracellularfluid. The nonionic dissolved CO Those learned in the art realize a redox state must be defined at a certain pH, or H The redox and phosphorylation states in various tissues in the rat have been given by Veech et al. By the term plasma or blood plasma as used herein conventional general reference is had to theliquid part of the blood as distinguished from the corpuscles. Plasma can be prepared by varioustechniques well known to those familiar with this art typically using centrifugal force to separate asupernatant which is plasma after non coagulated blood is centrifuged. By the term extraceullar fluid as used herein conventional general reference is had to all body fluidsin extracellular spaces outside of the circulatory system e.g. the blood and outside of intracellular fluid in amammal typically constituting about 15 of the weight of a mammal . By the term intracellular fluid as used herein conventional general reference is had the fluid withincells which constitutes about 57 of total mammalian body weight. It is well known that see Black DAK. Thus, in summary, the compositions of this invention tend to normalize a plasma pH, b compositionof major plasma inorganic electrolytes, including the milliequivalent ratio of Na It is theorized, and there is no intent to be bound by theory herein, that the solutions of the presentinvention, in addition to the properties above described, further tend to normalize at least one of thefollowing states The ratio of the chemical activity of free water on each side of a typical normal mammalian cellmembrane is always unity. Movement of water across such a cell membrane is achieved by the movementof osmotically active substances. Changing the cellular phosphorylation potential, through the NaK ATPase,therefore, Transmembrane cellular potential can be measured by known e.g. conventional techniques such aswith electrodes or probes, and the like. Calculation of such cellular voltage can be achieved from ameasurement of the distribution of chloride ions between intracellular and extracellular fluid followingNernst s law. A quantitative relationship is theorized to exist involving redox state, phosphorylation potential and theabove referenced three states. This relationship may be expressed by the following equation The values of the various terms in the foregoing equation of are given as follows for muscle and brain In the foregoing equation, the phosphorylation potential is shown to be in a state of near equlibrium withthe substrates of the sodium potassium ATPase. Since the chloride ion is cell wall permeable, this iondistributes itself in conformity with the transmembrane cellular potential. Movement of three sodium ions outof the cell and two potassium ions into the cell across the cell membrane necessarily results, from the lawof electrical neutrality, in the movement of one chloride ion from inside the cell to outside the cell across thecell membrane. This makes the sodium potassium ATPase, in effect, an osmopump resulting in the exportof two milliosmoles per ATP hydrolyzed. This pump is electro neutral. The T delta S term, which is approximately 5.6 kilocalaries per mole of ATP hydrolyzed, is an entropyterm. It, therefore, refers the state of randomness within the cell. The positive nature of this entropy termindicates that a high degree of order is imposed on the intracellular environment. In terms of quantum andstatistical mechanics, the number of ways of achieving a certain energy state is called its degeneracy Ω .The Boltzmann equation defines S or entropy as S K It follows from the foregoing equation 7, above, that the distribution of calcium inside the cell is afunction of the cube of the respective sodium concentrations inside and outside of the cell because of theaction of the high activity sodium calcium exchange enzyme. The following equation shows the relationship Unlike the simple NaK ATPase which moves 2 mOsmoles out of the cell thus moving H The net result of the foregoing equation 7 is that the water of both intracellular and extracellular fluid isa function of the sodium potassium ATPase EC 3.6.1.3 and also of the phosphorylation potential. It can be empirically seen that the voltage across a cell membrane is inversely related to the chloridedistribution and the phosphorylation potential. Correlation between phosphorylation potential, intracellular chloride and transmembrane cellular potentialfor various mammalian tissues is illustrated by Table II below From Table II, it is seen that low phosphorylation potential correlates with a high intracellular chloride,and a low transmembrane cellular potential correlates with the inherent setting of the potential as a functionof the Donnan active material within the cell with the phosphorylation potential merely overcoming theDonnan forces so as to export two milliosmoles, as described in equation 7. Because of the voltage dependent permeant nature of chloride ion to most non epithelial tissues Ho,MK, Guidotti G. The electrolyte solutions of the present invention can be prepared by any convenient or conventionalprocedure. As a matter of accuracy, the compositions of this invention can be described in terms of their ioncontents which can be expressed either in terms of millimoles per liter of solution, or milliequivalents perliter of solution. It is standard practice in this art in describing a given solution to separate anions fromcations, and nonionics from ionic materials this practice is followed herein in the main. As those skilled inthe art will readily appreciate, a translation or conversion of millimoles per liter of solution, or of milliequivalents per liter of solution, into grams of a given salt added per liter of water is routine and is givenin any standard text book in the field, such as, for example, Data For Biochemical Research 1969 Dawson R.M.C., Elliott W.H., Jones KM., Eds . Clarendon Press, Oxford at pages 507 and 508. Thisreference illustrates not only the salt starting materials, but also the order of addition of same in thepreparation of certain illustrative prior art electrolyte solutions shown therein. Solutions of this invention arereadily prepared by this type of procedure. The particular salt combination used for a given solution maychange from time to time in a manufacturing operation as those skilled in the art well know. The significantfactor is that the final concentrations of respective component ions in any given solution remain as specifiedor desired. In view of the developed state of this art, no detailed description of electrolyte solutionpreparation procedures is believed to be necessary or desirable herein. The solutions of this invention, and the component materials incorporated thereinto, are, in general,formulated, as to contain a combination of the desired physiological Na Thus, various initially existing pathological conditions can be ameliorated by practice of the processesand the compositions of the present invention, depending upon the particular solution used and theparticular use conditions and circumstances in any given use situation. Thus, by this practice of thisinvention, one can accomplish in a physiologically acceptable manner the removable of metabolic productsfrom cellular water, the replacement of body fluids and electrolytes, and the administration of nutrients, andthe like, as desired. The solutions may be administered in any fashion desired so long as they contact livingmammalian tissue. Administration can be accomplished by any convenient technique, such as for examples,intravenously, intraarterially, intradermally, intrathecally, orally especially when the solution contains thenonbicarbonate containing couples , across a semi permeable membrane, or the like, as those skilled in theart will readily appreciate. The solutions of this invention as prepared are, in general, well suited for theadministration of therapeutic agents to living mammals. When bicarbonate anions are not present, then the level of combined or sigma I lactate pyruvateand or d betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate present in a solution disclosed herein is optionally greater thanwhen bicarbonate is present in order to achieve the desired milliequivalent ratio of sodium to chloride, asindicated. The concentration of either sigma I lactate pyruvate and or of d betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetatein a given solution disclosed herein can thus range up to the full maximum quantity desired within the limitsdescribed herein . it is presently preferred, particularly when no bicarbonate is present, to employ a mixtureof I lactate pyruvate with a mixture of d betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate. Those skilled in the art will realize that in any given solution disclosed herein one can incorporate anexcess of one or more individual members of any one mixture couple so that a the ratio ofone member to the other of any given couple and b the total quantity of both mixtures or members liesoutside of the ranges hereinabove described.Such a single member excess is not recommended when practicing the method disclosed herein. However, if sucha single member excess does occur, the amount of the excess can be calculated by determining themaximum ratio of one couple member to the other which can be present in accord with the aboveteachings, and then the quantity of one couple member remaining or present which is outside of this ratiorange may be considered to constitute an excess. The effect of such an excess is evidently merely to cutdown, but not to eliminate, the efficacy of what effect would otherwise be obtained by using only a solutionwhich contains mole ratios and quantities of respective mixture couples disclosed herein. In the making of solutions disclosed herein, it is preferred to employ the optically active I lactate salts orI lactic acid which will make the desired I lactate anions in solution , and also similarly to employ d betahydroxybutyricacid or d betahydroxybutyrate salts which will make the desired d betahydroxybutyrateanions in solution . Choice of particular salt or acid or mixture used in any given case depends amongvarious factors, such as upon the other starting inorganic salts which a formulator desires to use basedupon availability, cost, and like factors , all as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. Racemic d I mixtures could be used, but their use is preferably avoided since these unnatural isomers are known tobe associated with specific toxic effects. Racemates can be metabolized. If such are used, the ratios of onemember to another in the respective near equilibrium couples involved should be based upon the quantityof particular optically active form present e.g. either I lactate In the sections disclosed herein at the pH ranges described, not all couple member material of anygiven couple will be in an ionized anionic or dissociated form a portion of this material will be in an unionized undissociated form. Typically, the quantity of undissociated material such as I lactate acid, pyruvicacid, d betahydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic, sodium bicarbonate, carbonic acid, or the like is not more than about 0.1 of the total quantity of all material of any given species e.g. I lactate, pyruvate, d betahydroxybutyrate,acetoacetate, or bicarbonate . For purposes of calculating a milliequivalent ratio, molarconcentration, or the like, it is preferred to base computations upon the total material of any given specieswhich is present in a solution of this invention. The carbon dioxide, when used, can be introduced either as a gas, preferably using conventionalaeration apparatus to effect a solubilization of CO As elsewhere indicated herein, if desired, a solution of this invention can also contain various knownadditives in concentrations taught by this art, but it is presently preferred not to. employ anions andnonionics which will not be safe entry points. In general, a solution disclosed herein should contain as a minimum a total of sigma lactate pyruvateand or sigma betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate and or sigma bicarbonate carbon dioxide which is at leastabout 0.5 millimoles per liter as indicated. Below these levels, benefits in normalization of body metabolismas explained above are apparently achievable, but such benefits become increasingly difficult to demonstrateand prove by state of the art techniques of measurement. Consequently, it is preferred to avoid, ifpossible, homeopathic possibilities by using minimum concentrations as above indicated. When bicarbonate is present, the total quantity of sigma lactate pyruvate and orbetahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate used can generally be reduced which is now believed to be desirable.Thus, when bicarbonate is present, the total sigma l lactate pyruvate and or d betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate is preferably about 2 to 17 millimoles per liter. When a solution of this invention contains at least one osmotically active substance preferablymetabolizable and nonionic , it is added to provide nutritional or osmotic requirements. Since it isuncharged, it does not therefore contribute to normalizing the Na All of the formulations of this invention from a composition viewpoint fall into what can be regardedgenerally as being either one of two distinct classes Class I fluids are typically administered at dose levels which are not greater than about 1 liter perhuman adult patient per 24 hour day, one typical dose level being 500 ml per such patient per 24 hour day. Class II fluids are typically administered at dose levels chosen by the physician, and these levels canrange from 0 to greater thn 100 liters per human adult patient per 24 hour day, depending uponcircumstances. Each of the inorganic electrolytes present in a solution of this invention is typically present in an amountof at least 0.5 mmol l thus clearly qualifying them as electrolytes as such rather than as trace metals,such as is associated with levels of iron, manganese, zinc and the like in normal plasma and which tracemetals can be present in normal plasma at levels less than 0.4 mmol l. If desired, of course, trace materialscan be added to solutions of this invention. Each of the cations sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium and each of the anions bicarbonate,chloride, and phosphate are normally found in the plasma and tissue of mammals at concentration levelsgreater than or equal to about 1 millimolar per liter of body fluid see Table I . The solutions of thisinvention, in general, contain respective inorganic electrolyte concentrations which resemble the correspondingconcentrations of such electrolytes in plasma when any one of such electrolytes is present inany given solution of this invention . Class I solutions are useful as intravenous solutions for electrolyte and fluid therapy especially where nomore than about 10 of total blood volume about 500 ml in an adult human is to be administered over a24 hour day. Solutions of this type have been used in the treatment of hemmorhagic shock where 2400mOsmolar NaCl solutions have been advocated. See Velosco IT, Pontieri V, Rocha M, Silva E, Lopes OU. Class II solutions find use in intravenous applications where over 10 of total blood volume about 500ml in an adult human is needed to to be given to a human adult over a 24 hour day. Administration can be made, for example, to a normal human with an impairment or injury, such as loss of limb or the like, or to ahuman with impaired renal excretion Class II solutions can be used as an improvement for lactated Ringer ssolution. Class II solutions also are useful in dialysis, peritoneal, ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis,where perhaps 120 160 liters per hemodialysis day per patient are used. Such solutions can be usedimprove existing acetate or lactate containing solutions, but use of acetate is not desired in the practice ofthis invention. Given the solutions of this invention, a physician may henceforth wish to administer normal orhypertonic saline solution only to correct a condition of metabolic alkalosis since giving Na Solutions of Class II can be used as such, or can be employed as diluent for plasma extenders or forreconstituted frozen blood. For example, dehydrated plasma can be dissolved and dispersed in a solution ofClass II so as to produce an injectable solution, as those familiar with the art will appreciate. Each one of these Class I and II solutions can be considered to be characteristically comprised of foursubgroups which can be stated briefly as follows As indicated above, avoidance of substances in solutions of this invention which do not constitute safeentry points is preferred. For example, use of such nonionic osmotically active substances as fructose andglycerol are preferably avoided and are not recommended for use in the practice of this invention. Also,avoidance of the organic anions used in the prior art which are not safe entry points is recommended,including use of lactate alone, acetate alone, lactate and acetate together, gluconate, citrate, and the like. Prior art in dialysis fluids show that the composition of the fluids now commercially used evidently isintended to approximate that of plasma with the proviso that the anion gap is typically corrected withabnormal amounts of typically acetate or lactate. The suggestion has also been made in the prior artdialysis fluid composition should approximate the composition of interstitial extracellular fluid. While suchcompositional approximations now appear to be essentially incorrect especially from the standpoint ofachieving dialysis fluids of maximal safety and utility and patient benefit, it is submitted that suchapproximations can be substantially benefitted by compounding dialysis solutions in accord with theteachings of the present invention both for hemo and peritoneal dialysis . Solution compositions of the present invention of Class I and Class II are generically characterizedherein above. The following Table III includes preferred solutions of this invention in terms ofcomposition at the time of administration e.g., water having dissolved therein each of the indicatedcomponents in the respective amounts indicated . With regard to the term nonionics in a solution or process of this invention, those skilled in the art willappreciate that this term connotes no net charge on the molecule involved at the particular solution pHspecified. Solutions of this invention can be prepared as concentrates which at 0.8 molar solutes or greater willinhibit bacterial growth, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, and such concentrates can then be dilutedwith water before administration to prepare compositions of this invention. In general, solutions of this invention are believed to be preparable so as to be storage stable forperiods of time at least sufficient to permit packaging, intermediate storage in sealed containers, followed byadministered. Optionally, sotutions as shown in Table III can additionally contain The electrolyte solutions of such Table III, as indicated above, are useful in such applications asintravenous administration for replacement of electrolytes and fluids, for parenteral nutrition, for dialysis, andthe like. For a particular field of use and or end use applications, the formulation of any given solution canbe optimized in accord with the desires of the formulator. Thus, in general, there is disclosedan Class I solutions which are particularly suited for electrolyte and fluid therapy are subgenericallycharacterized in Table IV below. Each Table IV solution comprises water which has dissolved therein eachof the indicated components in the respective amount indicated. In this Table IV the preferred class ofembodiments so identified can be regarded as being usable either as such, or as concentrates which canbe further diluted so long as nonionic material is included to keep the final osmolarity above about260 mOsmoles l. In the latter case, the diluted solutions should contain added dissolved nonionic material preferably glucose with care being taken to preserve in the product diluted solution the various ratios,osmolarity and pH values, all as shown in such Table IV. Such Class I solutions can be used in an This process comprises introducing intravenously into a mammal at a physiologically effective rate aquantity of such a solution in an amoutn which is not more than about 1 liter per 70 kilograms of mammalbody weight per 24 hour day. Class II solutions which are particularly suited for electrolyte and fluid therapy are subgenericallycharacterized in Table V below. As before, each Table V solution comprises water which has dissolvedtherein the indicated components in the respective amount indicated. In this Table V, the preferred classof embodiments so identified can be regarded as being representative of compositions which are nowbelieved to be suitable for usage, for example, by hospitals and the like. In making and using all thesesolutions, care should be taken to preserve the various ratios, osmolarity, and pH values, all as shown insuch Table V. Such Class II solutions can be used in an Class II solutions which are particularly suited for use in dialysis whether hemo or peritoneal aresubgenerically characterized in Table VI below. Class II solutions which are within the scope of Table VI above and which are particularly suited forhemodialysis are subgenerically characterized in Table VII below. As before, each Table VII solutioncomprises water which as dissolved therein the indicated components in the respective amounts indicated. Such Class II solutions in Table VII are suitable for use in a hemodialysis process of the generallyknown and conventional type where renal function of a living mammal is replaced in whole or in part bydialysis. In hemodialysis, portions of the blood of such mammal are continuously passed over one face of adialysis membrane which is incorporated preferably a high surface area cartridge like structure while theopposed face of such membrane is contacted with a dialysis fluid, thereby to achieve a change in thechemical composition of the body fluids after the so dialyzed blood is returned to the mammal s vascular system. Duration of a conventional hemodialysis can vary, depending upon equipment, conditions, patientcondition, and the like, but typically can extend for a time of from about 3 to 5 hours. Optionally, butpreferably, the dialysis membrane used in combination with the associated apparatus is such that the bloodso passed over such membrane can be pressurized during such passage typically and conventionally up toabout 300 grams per cubic centimeter , thereby to produce what is known in the dialysis art as ultrafiltration . In the conventional hemodialysis procedure, the dialysis fluid is an aqueous solution whichcontains dissolved therein the same principal inorganic electrolytes at respective individual concentrationlevels which approximate such major plasma electrolytes and their concentrations. In the patent hemodialysis one substitutes for the conventional dialysis fluid a solution of the presentinvention and as below characterized in Table VII. Conventional dialysis equipment can be used, but adeaerator, such as might tend to eliminate dissolved carbon dioxide from a dialysis solution of thisinvention, should not be present. During use in peritoneal dialysis, a solution of this invention Class II solutions which are within this scope of Table VI above and which are particularly suited forperitoneal dialysis are subgenerically characterized in Table VIII below. Such Class II solutions of Table VIII are suitable for use in a peritoneal dialysis process of the generallyknown and conventional type when renal function of a living mammal is replaced in whole or in part bydialysis. In peritoneal dialysis a quantity of a dialysis fluid is charged into the peritoneal cavity of suchmammal for a time sufficient to achieve a change in the chemical composition of body fluids, after whichthe dialysate is drained or otherwise removed from the peritoneal cavity. Typical residence times for fluid inthe peritoneal cavity range from about ½ to 1 hour, although longer and shorter times can be employed.Typically, peritoneal dialysis sessions last 4 ½ hours, but continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis hasrecently been advocated. The patient s own peritoneum serves as a dialysis membrane. In the conventionalperitoneal dialysis procedure, the dialysis fluid is, as in the case of a hemodialysis fluid and aqueoussolution which contains dissolved therein the same principal inorganic electrolytes and at respectiveindividual concentration levels which approximate those of major plasma electrolytes and their concentrations,except that in the case of peritoneal dialysis fluids a higher concentration of nonionics, such asglucose, is typically employed in order to provide as osmolarity which is greater than that of mammalianplasma, thereby to promote ion and water transfer through the peritoneum, all as known to those skilled inthe art. Chronic, so called ambulatory peritoneal dialysis may also benefit from these solutions. One may substitute for the conventional dialysis fluid a solution of the presentinvention and as below characterized in Table VIII. During use in peritoneal dialysis, a solution of this invention The quantity of such solution employed is comparable to the quantity used in prior art peritonealdialysis as is the residence time in the peritoneal cavity. The following examples are merely illustrative of the present invention and are not intended as alimitation upon the scope thereof. The following compositions of this invention and comparative examples illustrate electrolyte solutions of Class I above identified which are suitable for intravenous administration to replace electrolytes and fluid in a human adult patient atdose rates of, for example, 500ml patient 24 hour day. Each solution consists of water which has dissolvedtherein each of the identified in the respective specific per liter quantity shown components in the followingTable IX. Each solution is here prepared by dissolving substantially pure selected salt and nonionic materialfollowing the teaching of Date for Biochemical Research , 1969, pp.507 508. Each solution can be madefrom many different materials depending upon manufacturing convenience, ease of sterilization, cost of rawmaterials, and the like the only requirement is that the final ionic composition.of each solution should be asdescribed. The footnote for each example in Table IX characterizes the composition and provides a suggestedapplication or use. Also shown in Table IX are further examples of prior solutions. All solutions are listed as Type 1 a, b, c,and d, in conformity with the classification herein developed. The following compositions of this invention illustrate electrolyte solutions of Class II above identified which are suitable for a intravenous use to replace electrolytes and fluid b providing parenteral nutritionin a human adult patient, c peritoneal dialysis, and d hemodialysis. Dose rates can vary. Each solutionconsists of water which has dissolved therein each of the identified components in the respective specifiedconcentrations per liter quantity shown in the following Table X. Each solution is prepared by conventionalprocedures. See text of Examples 1 through 27 . The footnote for each example in Table X characterizes the composition and provides a suggestedapplication or use. These compositions demonstrate, as do Tables V through VIII above , that there is no essentialcompositional difference between these various solutions. Table XI shows prior art hemodialysis fluids for comparison purposes in dialyzing a human adult patientusing, for example, an apparatus as described by Miller J.H., Schinaberger J.H., Kraut J.A., and GardnerP.S., In these solutions which contain dissolved CO The following example illustrates usage of Class I solutions for electrolyte and fluid therapy. The most commonly used electrolyte solution used today, by those skilled in the art, is so called physiological salt, or normal saline by which is means 0.9 NaCl in H In this example, the replacement of plasma H 250 fed male Wistar rats are each anesthetized and systematically burned with gasoline over approximatelythe lower 50 of the body surface. A blood sample is taken from each rat prior to administration ofthe burn, and then again two hours after the burn from a venous canula inserted into the saphenous vein.Each animal is placed in a restraining case. In the opposite saphenous vein, a canula is inserted to measure plasma electrolyte content. Fiveminutes after the administration of each electrolyte solution, blood is drawn for electrolyte analysis. Eachrat s liver is removed, freeze clamped and the redox and phosphorylation states of liver measured by themethods previously described by Veech et al. It is observed that 1 2 hour after the gasoline burn, a series of weeping blisters develop over the lower1 2 of each rat s body. The volume of the transudate within these blisters is estimated by measurement ofarea and thickness to contain 4ml of transudate or 250 x 0.07 17.5 ml blood volume or about 40 ofthe rat s average total plasma volume. This deduction is confirmed by measurement of the rat hematocritwhich is 55 while the Na Each treated animal is judged to be in hypo volemic shock and 6mls of the three different solutions areinfused, by venous canula, over the next 10 minutes, into three different animals. Five minutes aftercompletion of the infusion, electrolytes are drawn from the canula, the animals sacrificed, and the liverfreeze clamped. The average blood electrolyte level, in each of the three groups of animals so infused, isshown in Table XIV below. It is observed that the animals given 1a1 0.9 saline solution each have hyperchloremic acidosis witha Na Cl ratio of 1.22 and plasma pH of 7.30. The animals given solution 2a3 Ringer s Lactate solution eachhave lactic acidosis with a plasma pH of 7.3 and an elevated lactate pyruvate ratio. Both groups of these animals have low serum HCO In Table 3 is given the results of the freeze clamping of the liver to illustrate the effects of thesesolutions on the nucleotide ratios in liver cells. These results indicate that only in the liver cells of the ratstreated with the redox balanced Ringer s lactate solution Table X, solution 2b2 of this invention do theseratios approach normal values. Here, it is seen that administration of Na Cl in 1 1 ratio leads to no change inthe cytoplasmic NAD NADH but does cause an increase in the cytoplasmic ATP ADP Pi . With nointention to be bound by theory, the elevation of ATP ADP Pi would be expected from equation 7 givenin another section. The conventional Ringer s lactate 2a3 gives a profound and pathological decrease inthe cyotplasmic NAD In contract, the new Redox Balanced Ringer s Lactate solution of the present invention does not changethe cytoplasmic NAD The procedure used is identical to that utilized by Woods, Eggleston and Krebs in Female Wistar rats, each weighing 170 215g, are obtained and are fed on a standard small animal diet D Glyceraldehyde, 1 α Glycerophosphate dicylohexyl ammonium salt having a purity of 96 of thecalculate L form and other substances, nucleotides, coenzymes, and crystalline enzymes. The method of liver perfusion used is that described by Hems, Ross, Berry Krebs 1966 . Theperfusion medium is the physiological saline Krebs Henseliet, 1932 , containing washed aged humanerythrocytes. The bovine serum albumin is dialyzed as a 10 solution at 4 C against three changes ofphysiological saline Krebs Henseleit and gassed with CO The perfusion medium described by Hems et al. 1966 is used, which contains initially about 1 mM I lactate 0.87 0.05 S.E.M. 14 umol ml derived from the erythrocytes. To decrease the initial lactateconcentration, the erythrocytes are washed five times with ten times their volume of phusiological saline.This lowers the initial lactate concentration in the perfusion medium to 0.23 0.02 S.E.M. 16 umol mol.The medium is gassed with CO Into the perfusion of 150ml is added a sufficient quantity of two parenteral nutrient solutions, onecontaining 10 mM D Fructose from a commercial source 5 Fructose in Electrolyte 75, Travenol, For the analysis of liver, samples are rapidly frozen Livers of large 300 450g rats are bled by perfusion in situ with cold isoosmotic KCl and thenhomogenized with 4 vol. of KCI. After centrifugation at 30000 x g for 20 minutes, the supernatant isfractionated with NH Chilled fresh rat and rabbit tissues are homogenized with 14 vol. of 1 mM EDTA and centrifuged for 20minutes at 30000 x g. The supernatant obtained is used in assays without further purification. A crystallinepreparation of rabbit muscle aldolase is supplied by the Boehringer Corp. London Ltd. ATP is determined by the method described by Lamprecht Trautschold 1963 , ADP and AMP aredetermined in the combined assay of Adam 1963 , Pi was determined by the method described byBerenblum Chain 1938 as modified by Martin Doty 1949 . Fructose I phosphate, is determined by themethod of Eggleston 1970 . Fructose I, 6 diphosphate, is measured together with total triose phosphates inthe combined assay of Bucher Hohorst 1963 pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 and 3 phosphoglycerateare determined in sequence Czok Eckert, 1963 . The references to other analyticalmethods are as follows α glycerophosphate Hohorst, 1963b L lactate Hohorst, 1963c glucose 6 phosphateand fructose 6 phosphate Hohorst, 1963c glucose I phosphate Bermeyer Klotsch, 1963 glucose and fructose Klotzsch Bergmeyer, 1963 the sum of D glyceraldehyde and glycerol Pinter,Hayashi Watson, 1967 . For the fluorimetric determination of very low concentrations of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphateand dihydroxyacetone phosphate by the method of Veech, Raijman, Dalziel Krebs 1969 , aportion of the neutralized supernatant is shaken for 1 minute with Florisil 100 200 U.S. mesh to removeflavins and then recentrifuged before use. In livers perfused with fructose where the concentration ofdihydroxyacetone phosphate is increased, it is determined by the spectrophotometric method of Bucher Hohorst 1963 . IMP is determined by a combination of paper chromatographic separation Krebs Hems,1953 and a spectrophotometric assay. A portion of deproteinized liver extract 0.1 or 0.2 ml is dried onto a1 cm area on Whatman no. 1 chromatograph paper under a current of hot air. Duplicates, with and withoutadded IMP standards 10 ul, 2mM solutions on the same spot, are developed by descending chromatographywith the isobutyric acid ammonia solvent mixture described by Krebs Hems 1953 for 45 48h atroom temperature. After drying in a current of air, the papers are examined under u.v. light from aChromatolite lamp Hanovia Ltd., Slough, Bucks, U.K. and absorbent areas are ringed by pencil. Averagedistances run from the starting line are IMP 23 cm, ATP 27 cm, ADP 32, cm, AMP and inosine 37 cm. IMPareas, and a blank area of similar size before the starting line, are cut out and dropped into 4ml of 10mMpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After gentle mixing at intervals for 1 h, 3ml is removed and theextinction at 248nm in 1cm wide silica cells in a Zeiss spectrophotometer is determined. At this wavelength,the Emax. x 10 The values of metabolites found in freeze clamped liver are given in Table XVIII. Infusion of a fructosesolution at a rate sufficient to raise the blood fructose level to 10mM In Table XIX, we see that raising blood fructose causes a three fold drop in ATP and a seven foldincrease in IMP. The phosphate is simply stripped off the nucleotides to put on fructose 1 P. In addition, theinorganic Pi in liver drops from 4.2 to 1.7 umoles g weight. Taken together, this is a picture of profoundmetabolic disorder in intracellular energy metabolism which may be avoided by using the alternative NaClbalanced, redox balanced solution which uses nutrients of the safe entry point class . In Table XX, we see the NAD The example also illustrates the concept of safe entry points discussed herein Compounds whichmay be included in solutions which directly contact living cells, without, for instance, first passing throughthe gut wall to be metabolically changed, constitute the group herein identified by having safe entrypoints . Members of the safe entry point group where levels over 3mM may be used in fluids directlycontacting cells are The toxicity of elevating bood glucose above 13 mM l is well documented in the studies of theUniversity Diabetes Group and must be balanced in the physician s judgment by the need for calories in thepatient. Glucose is herein demonstrated, however, to be much less toxic than fructose. Compounds which may not be used parenterally as safe entry points into the metabolic sequence, ascurrently practiced in the art, are The methods used in this example are found in the following reference Woods HF, Eggleston LV,Krebs HA. The cause of the accumulation of fructose 1 P on fructose loading. The procedure used here is similar to that utilized by Klim and Williamson in Male Wistar rats weighing 213 35g 66 , at time of death, are used there are no significant differencesbetween the mean body weights of the experimental groups. They are maintained on a standard smallanimal diet, and water ad libitum in an animal house with lights on from 08 00 to 20 00h. Chronic uremia isinduced by the five sixths bilateral nephrectomy technique Morrison, 1966 . Uremic rats are allowedapproximately 14 days to recover from the last operation before use. A commercial peritoneal dialysis solution is used, containing 45 mM acetate and 1.5 glucose 83mM and compared to a new dialysis solution of the present invention Example 3 . The composition of the twosolutions is comparatively shown in Table XXI. Control rats are simply given glucose to raise their bloodlevels to those occurring in dialyzed animals. The methods of measurement of liver metabolites are those of Veech and are described amply in theliterature such as Veech et al. In Table XXIII are given the changes in liver content of divalent cations, Pi, PPi and total metabolizablephosphate containing compounds after such treatment. It should be remembered that normal hemodialysis with 35 mM acetate makes the abnormal elevationin PPi reach 100 times normal with a quadrupling of liver Ca at the expense of bone stores of calcium. It isthus exaggerated in every way. Solutions containing 35mM Na Acetate currently account for about of 80 of hemodialysis in the U.S. The increased Pi demonstrated herein during acetate dialysis is hidden inliver and flows out into blood after dialysis accounting for why such patients remain persistentlyhyperphosphotemic leading to much current pathology found in chronic dialysis patients. The data presented in Table XXIII clearly show that peritoneal dialysis, with acetate containing fluids,leads to gross elevations of liver inorganic pyrophosphate and liver calcium. While not widely appreciated,inorganic pyrophosphate PPi is an important controller of cellular metabolic pathways of many types. SeeLawson J.W.R. et al. in Finally, Table XXIII shows that acetate induces a rapid increase of 4.2 umoles g wet weight of the liver srapidly metabolizing phosphate compounds. It derives this excess Pi from the blood and other phosphatestores. When the acetate is finally metabolized, this phosphate returns to the blood where Pi is 1 1.45mM.Since liver and blood are roughly equal in weight in the normal adult, this movement of Pi out of liver mustinevitably lead to the hyperphosphatemia which is a major and persistent pathlogical sequalae of uremia treated by current dialysis practice. This persistent elevation of blood Pi leads to chronic hyperparathyroidism,hypocalcemia, accelerated bone disease, ectopic calcification of tissue and many othercauses of morbidity and even mortality in chronic renal disease. Because the phosphate accumulates in theliver during acetate dialysis, it is effectively hidden from the beneficial effects which dialysis is trying toobtain, namely the removal of excess dietary Pi which is taken in by the patient during the intradialysisperiods. The use of acetate in a peritoneal dialysis fluid obviously causes a significant decrease in the freecytoplasmic NAD No example of the effects of using 35 to 45 mM L lactate alone, in a peritoneal dialysis solution, needbe given. It is by now obvious, from the teachings here presented, that such solutions are entirely withoutredox balance but indeed induce a profound lactic acidosis with a pathological decrease in the freecytoplasmic NAD Using hemodialysis equipment, which is the current major type in use, see Keshaviah et al., CRC Rats are made uremic as described in the previous example. After five days, they are fasted, attachedto a miniature hemodialysis apparatus, heparinized and dialyzed with two different solutions, one representingthe most common types of currently used hemodialysis solutions, and another where the anion gap ismade up without the use of HCO The compositions of the two example solutions are given in Table XXV. The rats are dialyzed with solutions 1 and 2 for four hours the animals are sacrificed and the liversfreeze clamped. A group of normal rats, starved 48 hours, are also sacrificed and their livers freezeclamped to serve as controls. Metabolites are measured, as previously described. In Table XXVI, we see that both acetate and new redox balanced dialysis fluids elevate liver sugar andthe first portion of the gluconeogenic pathway. During acetate dialysis, changes occur throughout thegluconeogenic sequence and the ratio of one metabolite to another changes. In Table XXVII are presented the changes in the controlling co factor ratios after the two types ofdialysis. In Table XXVII we see that acetate dialysis causes oxidation of the mitochondrial NAD In Table XXVIII are presented the results of the measurement of the Ca, Mg, phosphate andpyrophosphate content of rat liver after acetate versus redox balanced hemodialysis. We see in Table XXVIII that acetate dialysis raises inorganic pyrophosphate 200 times while redox balanceddialysis makes no change. Acetate hemodialysis increases liver calcium three fold redox balanced dialysis makes no change. Acetate hemodialysis increases total liver metabolizable phosphate by8.8 m moles g, while redox balanced dialysis increases liver metabolizable phosphate by only 0.5 mmoles g, or 16 times. The hidden phosphate, inaccessible to dialysis after acetate hemodialysis, is thelargest ever seen. The metabolic pathology is therefore even greater than that in Example 44. Solutions of this invention when administered not only regulate redox state and phosphorylation, butalso further tend to normalize the following states The following equations state the governing scientific laws involved The major buffer and controller of extra and intracellular pH.Henderson LJ. Nernst W. To convert In to log Van t Hoff JH. The gradient Ca2 i Ca2 o is thus a direct function of the Na o It will be clear to those skilled in the art that equation 7 is the statement of the reaction which links theexternal environment of the cell to its internal environment and metabolic machinery. Extracellular fluid isthus a creation of the metabolic process of the cell. Changing the external Na Additionally, the redox and phosphorylation states, the ΔE, and the TΔS of the cell are all related andtherefore manipulable by the relationships given. To control these parameters one needs to use solutions as provided herein which include definedconcentrations of Na Thus, the present invention provides a process for regulating This process is practiced by contacting cells with aqueous near equilibrium couples as taught by thisinventor or by varying the external concentration of Na
