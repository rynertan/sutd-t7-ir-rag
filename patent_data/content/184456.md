# INK CARTRIDGE MANUFACTURING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
An ink cartridge 10 is described with a rigid, hollow housing 12 within which an ink container assembly is positioned. The assembly includes an ink container 16 mounted, as by heat sealing, directly to an ink container support 18. The support 18 is secured by fasteners 24 to a cap 14 of the housing with a gasket 22 and gasket retainer 20 positioned between the support 18 and cap 14. The gasket retainer 20 includes plural gasket retaining projections 104, 150, 152, 156 and an outer peripheral wall 23 which bears against the cap 14 when the ink cartridge is assembled. The gasket support 20 and ink container support 18 cooperatively interfit. To manufacture the ink container assembly, the ink container support 18 is inserted through an opening 74 in a sheet of ink container forming material. The portions 78 of the ink container material bounding the opening are then secured to a planer mounting surface 72 of the ink container support 18. Sides 80, 82 of the sheet are then folded together and sealed to complete the ink container 16.
