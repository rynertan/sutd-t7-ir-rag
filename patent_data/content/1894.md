# Elongated strip for the formation of tubular articles and a method of forming the strip into an article.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with the provision of tubing formed from helically wound strip which is strong yet light in weight and consists in the formation of articles using an elongated strip which has on it a series of longitudinally positioned upstanding ribs 2 to form between them a series of longitudinally positioned channels 6 and including connecting means 2a, 2b on the strip spaced apart transversely or the strip whereby the strip can be wound helically to form an elongated object with the connecting means interengaged along a helical line to lock the strip in object form. Due to the use of ribs the strip may have a thin wall but have substantial strength.
