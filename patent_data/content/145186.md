# Gas damped acceleration switch.

## Abstract
A gas damped acceleration switch for use as a vehicle crash sensing device. A mass 18 is supported for move ment along an axis against a spring 14 , the mass 18 actuating a switch only after moving a predetermined distance against the spring 14 by an accelerating force. A gas damping system makes the device sensitive to the duration as well as the magnitude of the velocity change. Damping is provided by a plate 52 movable with the mass 18 having surfaces that are perpendicular to the axis of motion. The plate 52 is normally pressed against a mating surface 50 to exclude air. A seal is formed between the mating surfaces around the periphery so that a partial vacuum is formed as the mass 18 moves the surfaces apart. When the surfaces move apart a predetermined distance, the seal is broken and the pressure equalizes. However, the moving plate 52 still produces viscous damping as a function of velocity as it continues to be moved through the air by acceleration of the mass against the spring 14 .
