## Description
The present invention relates to a novel derivative of phenoxypropionic acid ester, a manufacturing process therefor, a selective herbicide containing said chemical compound as the active constituent and a herbicidal process using said herbicide. Many derivatives of the phenoxypropionic acid ester have been reported to have herbicidal effect, including, for example, 2 4 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenoxy propionic acid methyl ester, 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propionic acid methyl ester, 2 4 3,5 dichloro 2 pyridyloxy phenoxy propionic acid methyl ester, and 2 4 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyloxy phenoxy propionic acid butyl ester. However, the actions of these compounds are not always large enough. Therefore, there is still a strong demand for a selective herbicide which is capable of killing weeds of Gramineae family without damaging useful broad leaved crops such as beet, soybean, cotton, alfalfa, rape seed, potato, sunflower, Japanese radish, Chinese cabbage, cabbage, tomato, etc. regardless of whether it is used in pre emergence treatment or post emergence treatment. When herbicides using the conventional compounds of the phenoxy propionic acid ester are used, especially, when they are used after the growth of the weeds, it usually takes more than 8 days before their effects are fully displayed, and farmers growing such vegetables have been eagerly waiting for a solution to such problem. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to obtain said compound industrially, to provide an improved herbicide meeting the needs of the market, and to provide a herbicidal process using said herbicide.

The present invention will be further explained in the examples. 2 4 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenoxy propionic acid N methoxy N methyl aminocarbonyl methyl ester Compound No. 1 0.48 g of N methoxy N methylhydroxy acetic acid amide was dissolved into 30 ml of dichloromethane, and 1.38 g of 2 4 4 trifluoro methylphenoxy phenoxy propionic acid chloride was dissolved into 10 ml of dichloromethane. Then the latter solution was dropped into the former solution at room temperature. After this solution had been stirred for 10 minutes, 0.39 g of triethyl amine was added, and the solution was stirred for 8 hours at room temperature. Water was added to the reaction mixture to separate dichloromethane, which was washed with water, and dried over anhydrus magnesium sulfate.

The residue was refined by silica gel column chromatography benzene ethyl acetate 10 1 v v , and 1.0 g of the desired product was obtained. m.p. 98 101 C. The following compounds were synthesized by methods similar to the above. 20 parts by weight the same hereinafter of com pound No. 1 of the present invention, 60 parts of xylene and 20 parts of Sorpol 2806B Brandname of a product of Toho Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. were made into an emulsion by mixing them thoroughly by stirring. 10 parts of white carbon, 65 parts of Zeeklite SP Brandname of a product of Zeeklite Co., Ltd. , 5 parts of Sorpol 5039 Brandname of a product of Toho Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. and 20 parts of the compound No. 3 of the present invention were mixed and crushed to obtain a wettable powder. Soil was put in 1 5000 are Wagner s pots to create the upland condition, and certain quantities of the seeds of barnyard grass, Japanese radish and soybean were sowed. Then the soil in the pot was covered with a layer of soil about 1 cm in thickness containing the seeds of weeds of the Gramineae family such as the crab grass, barnyard grass, foxtail, etc. After 3 days from the sowing of the seeds, a liquid for spraying of a specified concentration was sprayed evenly on the soil. After 22 days from the treatment of the soil, the conditions of growth of the vegetables and the weeds were observed. The result are shown in Table 1. The values representing the degree of growth control of the weeds were classified into 5 grades 5 to 1 5 denotes complete destruction, and 1 no effect . 2 4 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenoxy propionic acid ethyl ester. 2 4 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyloxy phenoxy propionic acid butyl ester. 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propionic acid methyl ester. When the weeds which had been grown by the same method as that of EXAMPLE 5 had entered 3 3.5 leaf period, the chemical of the specified concentration was sprayed evenly over the leaves and the caules. After 5 days and 10 days from the treatment, the condition of the growth of the weeds was observed, and obtained the result shown in Table 2. The values of the degree of the growth control of the weeds are similar to those in the case of EXAMPLE 5. The compounds of the present invention have a satisfactory selectivity concerning vegetables such as beans, cotton, carrots, potatoes, beet, cabbage, mustard, peanuts, Japanese radish, tobacco, tomatoes,cucumbers, etc., and when these compounds having the usual concentrations for the usual use are applied for the pre emergence treatment and post emergence treatment of weeds, especially of the weeds of the Gramineae family, such as barnyard grass, crab grass, goose grass, foxtail, wild oats, water foxtail, yellow foxtail, quack grass, Agropyron tsukushiens, Bermuda grass, Johnson grass, etc., they display an excellent selective herbicidal effect. Also, when the compounds of the present invention are used for post emergence treatment, the period of time required for the development of the activity of the compound is 4 to 5 days, which is much shorter than that of similar conventional compounds, and this is one of the outstanding features of each of the compounds of the present invention.
