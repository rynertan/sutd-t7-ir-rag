# SEALABLE RECOVERABLE ARTICLES

## Abstract
The device for enclosing at least part of an elongate object, preferably a connection between electrical conduc tors, comprising a hollow dimensionally recoverable article 1 having an aperture that communicates between the interior and the exterior of the article, and a quantity of material 5 which seals an aperture. The material 5 is self sealing so that it will allow penetration of a test probe through the material and will continue to seal the article after removal of the probe. Advantageously the article 1 contains an arrangement for connecting the electrical conductors, for example a solder insert 3 or crimping connector.
