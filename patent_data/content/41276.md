# Methods for the transfer of image deposits formed by electroscopic marking particles.

## Abstract
A method of electrically transferring an image deposit formed of liquid dispersed electroscopic toner particles from an image bearing photoconductor surface of a recording member to the surface of an image receiving member in which an electrical transfer bias voltage is applied through the interface between the said surfaces in a direction normal to the said surfaces, and in which the said electrical transfer bias voltage is applied intermittently by successive pulses of opposite polarity and with successively increasing voltage, with the final pulse of an electrical polarity and magnitude to transfer the said imaging material to the said receiving member.
