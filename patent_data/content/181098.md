# Electronic viewfinder.

## Abstract
An electronic viewfinder for an electronic imaging still camera may be selectively operated in either an electronic viewfinder mode in which electronic image data sensed by the photoresponsive sensing elements 26 of the camera is transmitted to provide a video display 20 of the scene within the field of view of the camera or an optical viewfinder mode in which the image defining scene light rays are optically transmitted 32, 36, 38 for direct viewing of the scene within the field of view of the camera by the camera operator. The optical viewfinder mode of operation may be automatically initiated during the time in which the image defining data is transmitted from the image sensing ele ments 16 to the image data storing elements 26 and the viewfinder is inoperative to provide its video display.
