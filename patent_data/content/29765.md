# Creatinine iminohydrolase free from urease activity, methods of preparation and use, and assay compositions and analytical elements containing same.

## Abstract
A urease free creatinine iminohydrolase enzyme com position is obtained from an aerobic soil microorganism. The enzyme preferably has a molecular weight of from 250,000 to 300,000 a maximum activity at a pH between 7 and 8 as measured at 37 C a Km of 3 to 5 mM for creatinine as measured at 37 C, pH 7.5 and a specific activity for creatinine of at least 1.0 unit per milligram of protein in the composition as measured at 37 C, pH 7.5. The preferred enzyme composition is derived from the aerobic soil micro organism ATCC 31,546. Assay methods, compositions, and elements containing the urease free creatinine iminohydro lase for the determination of creatinine in an aqueous liquid are also disclosed.
