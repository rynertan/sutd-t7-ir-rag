# PERIMETER SECURITY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system is provided for locating and for characterising the source of attempted and or actual penetration of the security perimeters of relatively large geographical areas. The system comprises an array of structural moment detectors 361 , and electronic circuitry 363 for processing and manipulating signals derived from the detectors 363 in such a manner as to produce secondary signals indicative of any seismic forces caused by a penetration of the security perimeter, the effect of extraneous seismic forces being excluded. In one embodiment, the electronic circuitry 363 associated with each structural moment detector 361 is provided in the same housing as the detector to form a unitary device termed a structural information detector.
