# Multiple access communications system.

## Abstract
A flexible multiple access communications system which is particularly suitable for mobile radio systems. The system comprises a base station and a plurality of substations whose mode of access is determined in re sponse to an op code and parameters transmitted in an Aloha invitation message. The value of the op code and parameters and thereby the particular one of a plurality of access modes and the dynamic operation in that mode is determined from an estimate of the prevailing traffic condi tions. The different modes of access include light traffic mode, dynamic frame length mode, hybrid mode in which subsets of the population of the substations are formed and polling mode.
