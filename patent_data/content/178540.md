# CONNECTOR FOR SMD TECHNIQUE

## Abstract
A connector adapted to be surface mounted on a circuit board is provided. The free ends soldering ends of the termination legs contact legs of the contacts are led out of the connector in a single row manner. The soldering ends are preferably placed on the line of section of the two possible circuit board mounting planes perpendicular mounting and parallel mounting . For a three row connector, the soldering ends are spaced with a third of the spacing t . The same contacts and soldering ends may be used for the perpendicular mounting as well as the parallel mounting. The contacts may be of integral design or of a multi part design. Due to the U shaped design of the termination legs or the soldering ends present for one or more rows of contacts, both surfaces of the circuit board may be con tacted.
