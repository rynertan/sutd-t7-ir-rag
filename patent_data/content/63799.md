The 3 F chloropropyl 6 fluoro 1,2 benzisoxazole of the formula 5EMI6.2 is an important intermediate for the preparation of neuroleptics, and particularly, of the compounds of the formula 1 above. Japanese patent publication J5 1136 666 discloses a broad class of compounds of the formula I as starting materials for drugs exhibiting action on the central nervous system,EMI7.1 were R1 is hydrogen, halogen atom. lower alkoxy, or hydroxy X is a reactive ester residue of an alcohol e.g., chlorine, bromine, iodine, an aryl sulfonyloxy group, such as p toluene sulfonyloxy or benzene sulfonyloxy, or an alkyl sulfonyloxy group, such as methanesulfonyloxy and n is an integer 1 3. This disclosure, however, does not reveal or hint that 3 chloropropyl 6 fluoro 1 ,2 benzisoxazole is especially useful in the synthesis of neuroleptics, nor does it reveal or hint at the preparation of this precursor or a method by which to do so. Japanese patent publication J4 9070 963 describes the preparation of 1,2 benzisoxazole derivatives of formula II,EMI7.2 where R1 is hydrogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, alkyl, halogen, nitro R2 is halogen R3 is hydrogen, halogen R4 is hydro gen, halogen, carboxyl, alkoxyearbonyl by balogenating 1,2 benzisoxazole 3 acetic acid derivatives III,EMI8.1 where R is hydroxy, alkoxy, halogen and R1 is as shown under II. No method, however, is revealed or hinted at which would yield 3 g chloropropyl 6 fluoro 1,2 benzisoxazole of this invention or even closely related analogs or next adjacent homologs. A process for preparation. of a 3 g substituted propyl 6 fluoro 1,2 benzisoxazole is described. The process comprises cyclizing an oxime having the formulaEMI8.2 where X is a leaving group in organic nucleophilic displacement reactions.Typical leaving groups are a halide group, comprising C1 andBr, a tosyl group, a mesyl group, etc. A preferred halide isC1. R is a substituent selected fromEMI8.3 where alkyl is a straigth or branched chain hydrocarbon of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, andEMI8.4 The starting compound for the preparation of 3 Psub stit uted propyl 6 fluoro l ,2 benzisoxazole is 9 substituted 4 fluoro 2 hydroxybutyrophenone. A preferred compound is gamma chloro 4 fluoro 2 hydrobutyrophenone having a formula,EMI9.1 A butyrophenone precursor to this benzisoxazole is prepared by reacting 3 fluorophenol, with an acid chloride, such as the aicd chlorideEMI9.2 EMI9.3 in the manner described in Belgian patent 839,097. The resultant butyrophenone, e.g. g chloro 4 fluoro 2 hydroxybutyrophenone, is then converted into its oxime, e.g.EMI9.4 by reaction with a salt of hydroxylamine, utilizing conventional techniques and conditions. Typically hydroxylarnine hydrochloride is employed in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as pyrldine. The resulting oxime, gamma chloro 4 fluoro 2 hydrobutyrophenone phenone oxime, is predominantly the E oxime in respect to its position relative to the benzene ring. This reasoning is deduced from the fact that after acetylation to E gamma chloro 4 fluoro 2 hydroxybutyrophenone 0 acetyl oxime, the acetylated oxime gives a high yield 80 of 3 gamma chloropropyl 6 fluoro 1, 2 benzisoxazole on cyclization. The resulting oxime, e.g.EMI10.1 is reacted with an acyl anhydride, acetyl halide, e.g., chloride, or benzoic anhydride or halide to form an O acetyl or O benzoyl compound e.g.EMI10.2 where R is selected fromEMI10.3 alkyl, where alkyl is a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon substituent having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, andEMI10.4 It is to be understood that other reagents reacting with the OH group of the oxime may be employed to form O alkanoyl orO aroyl derivatives, as for example, propionic anhydride, butyric anhydride, acetic benzoic anhydride, propionyl chloride, butyroyl chloride, and benzoyl chloride. The resulting O alkanoyl or O aroyl derivative is then cyclized in the presence of a base to form the desired compoundEMI10.5 3 g chloroprepyl 6 fluoro 1,2 benzisoxazole. Typically the cyclization is carried out in the presence of potassium carbonate. Alternate reagents of. potassium carbonate to effect cyclization of the O acyl oxime, e.g., E gamma chloro 4 fluoro 2 hydroxybutyrophenon O acetyl oxime, include alkaline reagents such as sodium bicabonate, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide and potassium hydroxide. Because of the necessity to avoid excess alkali with its potential for reaction with the chlorine atom of the chloropropyl side chain attached to the benzisoxazole ring, it is desirable to limit any alkali present to a slight excess over that required to react with the phenol group. Desirably, alkali remaining after reaction with the acetylated oxime should not cause a pH greater than 9 after dilution with water.Cyclization with reagents yielding a pH after reaction and dilution with water below 8 are preferred. It is understood that the above identified reactions of the reaction sequence are carried out in a conventional solvent system typically employed therefor and well known to those skilled in the art. The overall reaction sequence from gamma chloro 4 fluoro 2 hydroxy butyrophenone to its oxime to its acetylated oxime to 3 gamma chloropropyl 6 fluoro 1, 2 benzisoxazole is remarkable for its high yield of desired product. This yield is the more remarkable in that the g chloropropyl group survives intact and is available for subsequent use in reactions to prepare compounds having neuroleptic utility, such as for example 4 , C chlorophenyl 1 r3 6 fluoro I ,2 ben zisoxazole 3 yl propyl 4 hydroxypiperidine. The 1 3 6 fluoro 1, 2 benzisoxazol 3 yl propyl 4 hydroxy4 phenylpiperidines of the present invention are useful as analgesic agents due to their ability to alleviate pain in mammals which is demonstrated in the phenyi para quinone writhing assay in mice, a standard assay for analgesia Proc.

The 1 3 6 fluoro 1,2 benzisoxazol 3 yl propyl 4 hydroxy 4 phenylpiperidines of the present invention are useful for treating psychoses by virtue of their ability to block apomorphine induced climbing in mammals. Antipsychotic activity is determined in the climbing mice assay by a method simiiar to those described by P. Protais et al., Psychopharmacoi., 5 3, 1 1976 and B. Costall, Eur. J.Pharmacol., 5 3, 39 1978 . The subject CK 1 maie mice 23 27 grams are group housed under standard laboratory conditions. The mice are individually placed in wire mesh stick cages x 4 x I0 and are allowed one hour for adaptation and exploration of the new environment.Then apomorphine is injected subcutaneously at 1.5 mg kg, a dose causing climbing in all subjects for 3 3 minutes. Compounds to be tested for antipsychotic activity are injected intraperitoneaiiy 3 3 minutes prior to the apomorphine chalienge at a screening dose of 18 mg kg. For evaluation of climbing, 3 readings are taken at 1 3, 20 and 3 3 minutes after apomorphine administration according to the following scale Climbing Behavior Score Mice with 4 paws on bottom no climbing 0 2 paws on the wall rearing 1 4 paws on the wall full climb 2 Mice consistently climbing before the injection of apormorphine will be discarded. With full developed apomorphine climbing, the animals are hanging onto the cage wails, rather motionless, over longer periods of time. By contrast, ciimbs due to mere motor stimulation usually only last a few seconds. The climbing scores are individually totaied maximal score 6 per mouse over 3 readings and the total score of the control qroup vehicie intraperitoneally apomorphine subcutaneously is set to 100 .
