## Description
PREFORMED BARRIER The present invention relates to a preformed barrier structure useful in the construction industry. Barrier protection of structural foundations is conventionally formed by parging the foundatim s exterior surface with a waterproofing paint or cement or an asphaltic composition. This must be carefully done to assure that it fully covers the foundation surface. When drainage enhancement is desired , this is normally accomplished by placing drainage tile or pipe at the foundation footing and installing gravel or the like over the tile and against the parged foundation wall during backfill. Formation of such a barrier is labor intensive, requires use of heavy material and, therefore, heavy equipment, and the installation of the gravel tends to chip and break the formed waterproofing membrane. Further it is recognized that structural foundations formed from poured concrete, cinder block and the like do not offer high insulation and therefore do not protect the interior space from exterior temperature conditions. Where the structural design requires the interior space to be useful for any one of various purposes and to be energy efficient, one requires the application of insulation to the walls in addition to waterproofing and drainage. The roof or upper decking of a structure also requires waterproofing and other protection. Built up roofing has been employed for many years wherein a roof deck supports a membrane which prevents penetration of moisture. Such water impermeable membranes have been formed from conventional asphaltic and bituminous compositions, laminates of the asphaltic or bituminous material with fibrous products, such as roofing felt or from rubberized asphalt, synthetic polymeric compositions or by applying sheet waterproofing membranes such as formed from butyl, neoprene or a polymer film supported rubberized asphalt. Conventional roof structures contain insulation within the structure to aid in maintaining constant and comfortable temperature. More recently, it has been found that installation of insulation on top of the exterior surface of the roof membrane has the advantages of maintaining the applied waterproofing membrane at a more constant temperature causing longer life of the membrane. Such roofing structures have been dubbed upside down roofs . The conventional manner of forming an upside down roof entails a multiplicity of steps including first applying a waterproof roofing membrane, such as formed from asphalt or bituminous composition, allowing the applied composition to cool and permitting sufficient time for the asphalt to cure by the evaporation of volatiles. A mastic is then applied to the membrane by spraying or the like to cause adhesion and anchoring of the subsequently applied insulation.A protective layer is applied over the insulation and then gravel or the like material is placed on top to further aid in anchoring and securing the structure. Conventional waterproofing membrane materials are not generally used in the installation of upside down roof structures. Such membranes are weak, tender materials which are required to be in contact with a support sheet, such as a polyethylene sheet, to enhance the strength of the membrane and to protect it from puncture and the like damage.Such support sheets must be securely adhered to the membrane and, therefore, cannot be removed without tearing and destroying the membrane. The support sheet inhibits adhesion of any subsequently applied layer, such as that of a porous insulating material, and the installer must, therefore, apply a strong mastic and or an anchoring cover, such as gravel, etc., over the insulation material to maintain its position. According to the present invention, there is provided a preformed barrier including a porous generally rigid, board with a non porous adhesive sheet adhered to and covering one side of the board and a protective coating to prevent superimposed layers of the barrier adhering to one another prior to installation. The porous board can have closed pores, making its insulation very effective, or open interconnected pores which enhances drainage. The structure is unitary and easy to apply. It can be used both on roofs and deck structures, where its waterproofing and insulating properties are taken advantage of, and, for instance, at footings and foundations where the insulation, drainage and waterproofing properties are of use.Because of its unitary structure it can be applied with minimum labour and time. Preferably a bituminous sheet is used for the adhesive sheet. The adhesive sheet may include reinforcement. There may be channels formed in the face of the board remote from the adhesive sheet to assist water disposal and run off.A layer of cloth or mat may be provided to cover the side of the porous board remote from the adhesive sheet. This, particularly for its open pore embodiments, helps to ensure that such pores do not become clogged up. In order that the invention may be more clearly understood, the following description is given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an oblique view of a first embodiment of barrier of the invention Figures 2, 2A and 2B are each an oblique, cut away view of a modification of the first embodiment of barrier Figure 3 is an oblique view of the first embodiment with the modification of an extended adhesive bituminous membrane Figure 4 is an oblique view of a second embodiment of barrier of the invention Figures 4A and 4B are each an oblique, cutaway view of a modification of the second embodiment Figure 4C is an oblique view of the second embodiment with the modification of an extended adhesive bituminous membrane Figures 5A, 5B and 5C show possible patterns for the spaced, continuous channels on the surface of the board in the second embodiment Figures 6 and 6A are cross sectional views of the barriers of Figures 1 and 4, respectively, when applied to a structural surface Figure 7 is a composite view of two barriers of the second embodiment of the invention applied to a vertical structural wall with ancillary drainage means Figures 8 and 8A are cross sectional views of the barriers of Figures 3 and 4C, respectively, when applied to a structural surface. In general, the invention provides a barrier having a porous board with a non porous adhesive sheet or membrane attached to one side which provides moisture proofing of the structural surface and by which the barrier is to be attached to a surface. Embodiments where the pores in the board are generally closed are especially suitable for application to exterior surfaces of either subterranean walls or roofs to form a waterproofing and insulating barrier. Embodiments where open interconnected pores are provided in the board are especially suited for use as waterproofing and drainage means. In accordance with a preferred feature open channels are provided at the side of the board remote from the adhesive sheet.The barrier is then especially suitable for application to the exterior surfaces of subterranean structural walls, such as foundation walls and subterranean formations such as, for example, subway tunnels and stations, and underground parking areas to act as a combination of water barrier, drainage enhancing means and as an insulator from exterior temperature changes. It is generally known that such subterranean structural walls require application of a waterproofing barrier to prevent ground water from permeating the pores of the structural wall usually formed from concrete and or cinder block and eventually entering the interior area of the structure.To prevent a build up of hydrostatic ground water pressure against the walls which causes ground water permeating and passing through the structural walls, drainage means, such as gravel or other porous material, is conventionally placed adjacent to the walls. Finally, many subterranean structures are required to be maintained within prescribed temperature ranges. Thus insulation of the walls of the structure is required. Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 2A, a barrier structure 1 comprises a porous, substantially planar board member having one of its major surfaces covered with an adhesive sheet material which is preferably an adhesive bituminous sheet. The porous board is generally rigid and is substantially planar and sheetlike. By the term rigid we mean that the board has only a limited amount of flexibility and may be bent to a small degree by the application of force, the specific amount of flexure depending upon the dimensions of the structure, but it will be capable of retaining its planar configuration with respect to its major faces. A planar configuration for the porous board will permit the barrier of the invention to be placed on and secured to planar structural members, such as a roof deck or foundation walls.However, in certain instances, it may be desired to have the porous board in a predetermined non planar configuration which conforms to the configuration of the structural surface to which it will be ultimately applied. The porous board 2 can be formed from any generally rigid open or closed cellular material.Closed cellular materials have discrete pores 3 throughout the board. This type of board is water impermeable and, due to the closed pores, forms a very effective insulation material. Closed cellular boards can be formed from such materials as styrene polymer foams, styrene acrylonitrile copolymer foams, styrene methylmethacrylate copolymer foams, polyethylene foams, polyurethane foams, asphaltic compositions, such as polymer as, for example, styrene, ethylene acrylate copolymer, ethylene vinyl acetate, and the like , modified asphaltic foams and the like, and foamed glass. The closed cell structure is conventionally formed by supporting the material in its plastic state by external pressure during the formation of the gas bubbles and until the material becomes sufficiently rigid to retain the gas in the cell formed. Such structures can also be conventionally formed by extrusion of a polymeric material containing a blowing agent, such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon or a lower alkane. Upon egress from the extruder the material expands due to decompression and the vaporized blowing agent is entrapped in the solidified product. Open cellular materials have cells such as cells 3 which are interconnected to define tortuous paths from surface to surface. Such open cellular materials are cellular polymeric foams including those formed from polystyrene foams having interconnecting voids, urea formaldehyde, phenol formaldehyde, and polyurethane. Porous board of an open cellular configuration can also be formed from random fibrous batting such as rigid fiberglass batting or from polymer modified asphalt foams. The porous board has a first 4 and a second 5 major surface and edges 6 . The porous board may be of any desired shape. It is preferred for the shape of the board to be a quadrilateral, preferably a parallelogram, and more preferably a rectangle or square. Boards, and thereby barriers, of any convenient dimensions for the construction industry or for particular applications can be formed, such as boards which are from about 1 to 6 feet 30 cms to 2 m , preferably 2 to 4 feet 60 cms to 120 cms wide and from 1 to 12 feet 30 cms to 4 m preferably 2 to 10 feet 60 cms to 3 m long. The thickness of the board can vary from about 0.25 to 10 inches 0.6 to 25 cms preferably from about 0.5 to 4 inches 1.2 to 10 cms .The barrier, being normally formed of light materials,can be of large dimensions to cover, in one step, a large expanse of structural surface. s When an open cellular board is used, it is preferred to have attached to the second major surface 5 which is oppositethe adhesive layer a fibrous cloth or mat 11 formed from woven or non woven organic or inorganic natural or synthetic fibers. The cloth or mat should have a porosity smaller than that of the porous board and sufficient to inhibit intrusion of dirt and gravel particles into the pores of the barrier s board. The mat or cloth can be adhered to the board in known manner, as by heat bonding of thermoplastic materials where appropriate or by aid of a mastic. The open cell porous board 2 is securely adhered to a preformed adhesive non porous sheet material 7 such as a preformed a adhesive bituminous sheet material to form a barrier of the present invention. This barrier forms a water drainage enhancer waterproofing barrier which can be readily applied to structural surfaces such as foundation walls and exterior walls to provide a one step installation means. Similarly, the closed cell porous board is securely self adhered to a non porous adhesive sheet material 7 suchasapreformed adhesive bituminous sheet material to produce a barrier of the present invention. This barrier forms an insulation water proofing barrier which can be readily applied to roof decks to form an upside down type of roof construction or to vertical walls, such as foundation walls and exterior walls, to provide a one step installation of a waterproofing barrier and to provide insulation capacity to the wall structure. Thus a preformed non porous adhesive sheet 7 for fulfilling both waterproofing and anchoring functions is directly adhered to the porous board 2 .The adhesive sheet 7 is preferably an adhesive bituminous membrane and in what follows is referred to as such. The adhesive bituminous membrane can be formed from any bituminous material which has adhesive properties at least with respect to each of its major surfaces. The terms bituminous and bituminous composition mean compositions formed from a bitumen, asphalt, tar or pitch base. Sheet products which have adhesive properties are known and are formed from blends of bituminous material and a natural or and synthetic rubber or resin. These blends can be formed with a natural or synthetic rubber which is virgin or reclaimed to provide a smooth mix.The synthetic rubber can be, for example, styrene butadiene rubber SBR , acrylonitrile butadiene rubber NBR , chloroprene rubber CR , isoprene rubber IR , butyl rubber IIR , and the like. The ratio by weight of bituminous material to rubber is generally from about 80 20 up to about 95 5 and preferably from about 85 15 to 95 5. Generally, suitable compositions have a softening point Ring and Ball method of 600 to 1400 C. and preferably 600 to 1100 C. and a penetration value of 50 to 400, preferably 150 to 300 at 250 C. 100 g. 5 sec. I.P. method . The preformed adhesive sheet material suitable for use in the present invention can have a laminate structure formed from a multiple of layers provided that the laminae forming each of the major surfaces of the sheet product is formed of an adhesive composition. Further, the adhesive bituminous sheet formed from a single or multiple layers, as described above, can have embedded therein a web or cloth formed from a woven or non woven organic or inorganic, natural or synthetic fibers staple or continuous filament such as glass, hessian, cotton, or synthetic polymers, polyolefins, polyamides, polyesters polyethylene terephthalate , polyurethane and the like.The web or fibrous cloth should be of a thickness not greater than about half, preferably less than one quarter the thickness of the bituminous sheet material 7 . The bituminous sheet has two major surfaces and edges which define its dimensions. The sheet should be at least 0.01 inch 0.025 cm thick, preferably 0.025 to 0.2 inch 0.063 to 0.5 cm . The thicker the bituminous sheet the better the waterproofing effect but, in general, a sheet of from 0.025 to 0.15 inch 0.063 to 0.4 cm thick is satisfactory for most application The sheet s first major surface 8 is superimposed on and at least coextensive with the first major surface 4 of the porous board 2 . The sheet 7 is in direct contact with the porous board 2 and the adhesive properties of the first major surface 8 of the sheet causes the composite to be a unitary structure. The barrier can be stored, transported and sold with a protective sheet coating 10 coextensive and congruent with the second major surface 9 of its adhesive bituminous sheet to aid in handling. This surface will, upon removal of the protective coating at the construction site, be applied to the structural surface to be sealed.The protective coating 10 is in the form of a sheet product such as siliconized paper, cloth, polymer film or the like sheet product treated with a release agent so that it is substantially non adherent with respect to the adhesive sheet s second major surface 9 substantially n6n adherent means herein and in the appended claims to be readily removable from the adhesive sheet s second major surface without causing damage . The release agent used in conjunction with the coating sheet can be any commercial release agent such as a dispersion of a silicon compound, for example, a dispersion of poly dimethyl siloxane . Alternately, as shown in Figure 2B the subject barrier 1 can be stored, transported and sold with a coating llC of a film of a release agent directly applied such as by spraying, brushing or the like to the free surface 5 the second major surface of the porous board or to the fibrous cloth 11 which is adhered to the second major surface 5 which is applied to aid in inhibiting plugging of the pores by foreign matter. The film can be very thin and normally need not be greater than about 5 mils thick. Greater thickness may be applied but normally does not add to the non adherent properties.The second major surface 9 of the adhesive sheet 7 is thus free for ready application to the construction surface. The release agent can, as above, be any conventional release agent capable of rendering the surface substantially non adherent with respect to the adhesive sheet s second major surface, such as a dispersion of a silicon compound, as for example, a dispersion of poly dimethyl siloxane or the like.When the subject barrier 1 is treated with release agent llC on the second major surface 5 of its porous board 2 , or on the fibrous coating, the barrier can be stored, transported and sold without problem by stacking the barriers so that the adhesive bituminous sheet of one barrier is coextensive and congruent with the release coating on the porous board free surface of another barrier which in turn is coextensive and congruent to still another barrier in the same manner. The bottom element of the stack should be a release coating treated board or the like without a membrane. The protective coating liy is an integral part of the barrier and need not be removed and disposed of at the construction site.The barriers can be each removed from the storage stack and directly applied to the structural surface to be sealed. The adhesive bituminous sheet 7 has dimensions of length and breath defined by its edges 12 . The sheet may be of a dimension such that it is coextensive and congruent with that of the porous board 2 with which it forms a composite barrier 1 as shown in Figure 1. Figure 3, illustrates a variation wherein the sheet has dimensions such that it covers all of one surface of the porous board and extends, with respect to at least two edges, beyond that of the coordinate spacially close and substantially parallel edges of the porous board. In this manner the sheet shall have an overhang with respect to at least two edges and thus provide a means for overlapping at the junctures of the applied barriers over the entire expanse of the structural surface. The two extended edges 12A of the sheet of any one barrier board can be adjacent edges, that is edges which meet at one corner area 13 of the barrier. Alternately, not shown the extended edges can be parallel to each other for example, on opposite sides of a quadrilateral parallelogram or the sheet edges can extend on all sides with respect to the porous board of the barrier. The extended portions of a bituminous sheet of any one barrier will have the associated extended portion 8A of its first major surface exposed. To aid in handling during storage, transportation, etc. this exposed portion 8A of the first major surface should be covered with a coating sheet 14 similar to that described above with respect to the coating sheet 10 for the membrane s second major surface 9 . The coating 14 should be treated with a release agent, as described above, to permit its ready removal. This release agent should, preferably, impart non adherent properties to a lesser degree in comparision to that used on the protective coating for the membrane s second major surface. Such agent could be, for example, a modified poly dimethyl siloxane having a fraction of the methyl groups replaced by hydrogen, a higher alkyl or a phenyl group. When the barrier is supplied with a protective coating llC as an integral part of the second major surface 5 of the porous board 2 and the barrier is of a configuration having extended portions 8A of its bituminous sheet, the protective coating should also cover the edge surfaces 6 of the board 2 and should be on both surfaces of the coating sheet 14 which covers the exposed portion 8A of the first major surface of the adhesive bituminous sheet. In this manner the extended portion of the bituminous sheet can drape downwards over the edge surface and even depending on its dimensions the protected surface of extended bituminous sheets of lower barriers in a stack of barriers during storage, etc.The extended free surface of bituminous sheet component of any one barrier will only be in contact with a protective coating i.e. a release agent coating providing protection during storage, transportation, etc., providing ready separation and removal of any one barrier from the storage stack and providing ready application without requiring removal and disposal of large quantities of protective sheet product. The adhesive bituminous sheet of the barrier can extend beyond the porous board for about 1 to about 10 inches 2.5 to 25 ans or more, preferably from 2 to 8 inches 5 to 20 cms to permit overlapping with a sheet of the next applied barrier and to permit extended adhesive to adhesive contact to assure forming a secure watertight seal. The application of the subject barrier can be readily done without the need for extensive labour or the use of extensive equipment and material as is normally required in applying a composite roof or wall structure. Figures 4, 4A, and 4B and 4C illustrate a second embodiment of the subject barrier in which the porous board component has spaced continuous channels 15 on its surface 5. It is preferred that the cellular structure 3 be of a closed cellular configuration to provide a barrier suitable to provide a combination of waterproofing, insulation and drainage means. Figure 4, 4A, 4B and 4C ofa second embodiment of the barrier correspond to Figures 1, 2, 2B and 3, respectively. Elements 1 to 14 are essentially as described above with respect to Figures 1, 2 and 3. The second major surface 5 of porous board 2 has spaced, open, continuous channels 15 embedded therein.The channels can form any pattern provided that there is at least one open continuous channel path from any point of any one channel which is provided for by the single channel or through a route formed by a combination of channels which terminates at each of at least two opposite edges 6 of the porous board 2 . Such barriers should be applied to the structural surface so that one of the edges at which the majority of the open channels terminate is orientated at the lowest part of the barrier. It is preferred that there are open continuous channel paths from any point of any one channel which terminates at each df the edges of the porous board. With this preferred mode, the barrier can be applied to structural walls in any orientation sideways or up and down and readily present an open continuous downwards path by which water can be readily removed.The channels 15 shown inFigure 4 are a series of parallel spaced channels orientated at a diagonal with respect to the edges 6 of the porous board 2 and a second series of parallel spaced channels oriented at a diagonal with respect to the edges 6 of porous board 2 and also oriented at substantially right angle to the first series of channels. The channels thus form a criss cross pattern permitting one to follow a path from any point of each channel to each of the four edges. Alternately, each series of channels can be oriented substantially parallel to at least one edge of the porous board. Other patterns can be used. The main criteria with respect to channel pattern and configuration is that there be at least one open, continuous channel path from that channel point to the bottom or lowest edge of the porous board when its barrier is applied to a structural wall. The term open as used in the present specification and appended claims when referring to channel configuration means that each channel opens out along its whole length onto one major surface of the porous board thus providing a groove in the major surface. The term continuous as used in the present specification and appended claims means a continuous, non segmented channel from one end to the other capable of having a continuous path to provide a descending egress means alone or in combination with other channels when the barrier is in a vertical use position. The channels shall be spaced from each other over the majority of the major surface upon which they open to thus provide a porous body of maximum thickness over the major portion of the structural surface to which the barrier is applied. The ratio of the channel depth 16 to thickness of the porous board 17 should be such as to a provide a ready egress means for water entering the channel under contemplated use conditions and b retain sufficient porous board beneath each channel to sustain board strength. The ratio is normally from about 0.1 to 0.75 with from 0.25 to 0.6 being preferred. Normally, thicker boards can accommodate higher channel depth to board thickness ratios. The width of each channel can be from about 0.5 to 5 times its depth though higher or lower values can be used. Channels of a depth greater than normally tolerable with respect to such porous boards can be formed in boards used in the subject barrier. Although each channel forms a line of weakness with respect to the boards flexural strength, such weakness is overcome and the strength enhanced by the overall laminate structure of the barrier. Further, once applied to a structural wall the barrier has enhanced strength even under great loads and the channels permit the subject barrier to conform to any small curvatures or irregularities in the surface of the structural wall to which it is applied. Figure 4A is a cut away perspective view of the subject barrier 1 in which the second major surface 5 and its open channels 10 are covered with a fibrous cloth or mat coating 11 . The coating 11 is formed from woven or non woven organic or inorganic natural or synthetic fibers. The fibers can be formed from any one of the materials described above with respect to the mat embedded in the sheet and as described above for fibrous coating. The cloth or mat should preferably have a porosity sufficiently small,such as equivalent to about 50 U.S. Standard Mesh or smaller, to inhibit intrusion of dirt and gravel particles into the channels 15 of the barrier s board 2 . The mat or cloth can be adhered to the board in known manner, as by heat bonding of thermoplastic materials where appropriate or by aid of a mastic. The barrier 1 is thus a unitary structure in which the porous board s first major surface 4 is in contact and adhered to the first major surface 8 of the preformed adhesive sheet and the porous board s second major surface 5 is in contact and adhered to a woven or non woven fibrous coating 11 . When the structural surface has been treated for moisture proofing by some conventional means, such as parging with an asphaltic composition or painted with a waterproofing comEosition, the subject barrier 1 can be used without the preformed, non porous adhesive sheet 7 .The barrier 1 not shown would comprise a porous board 2 having spaced, open, continuous channels 10 on at least the board s second major surface 5 which surface is covered with a fibrous cloth or mat 13 . This barrier could provide a combination insulation and drainage means when positioned adjacent structural surfaces. Figure 4B depicts the subject barrier in a preferred mode with a fibrous cloth 11 adhered to the second major surface 5 of board 2 with a coating llC thereon of a non adherent composition with respect to the adhesive sheet 7 such as of a release agent as described above. The coating llC is a film of release agent containing composition applied directly to 11 by conventional application such as by spraying, brushing or the like. When the fibrous cloth 11 has porosity which exposes a portion of surface 5 , the coating llC , as applied, is a film over the combination of 5 and 11 . The adhesive bituminous sheet 7 may be of a dimension such that it is coextensive and congruent with that of the porous board 2 with which it forms a composite barrier 1 as shown in Figure 4 and 4A. The sheet 7 may have dimensions such that it extends beyond at least one of the edges of porous board 2 similar to that described hereinabove with respect to Figure 3. It is preferred, when using the barrier of this second embodiment as a drainage means on subterranean structural walls to have an extended edge 12A on only one side, which corresponds to the length of longer side the barrier. In this manner the sheet shall have an overhang with respect to at least one edge and thus provide a means for overlapping at the junctures of the applied barriers over the entire expanse of the structural surface.The extending edge 12A of sheet 7 should preferably be with respect to the longer or major edge of the barrier. Normally, the barrier will have a length sufficient to cover the entire height of the structural surface. Placement of the barrier of Figure 4C onto a structural surface with the extended sheet vertically orientated permits overlapping of the adhesive sheet with the adhesive sheet of the adjacent barrier to insure waterproof seams. Figures SA, 5B and 5C show some of the various alternative patterns which channels 10 can form on the surface of porous board 2 . Each of the channel patterns forms an open, continuous channel network to present a ready downward egress means for carrying liquid water away from the structural surface. Figure 5A illustrates a channel pattern formed by two sets of spaced channels a set of horizontal spaced channels 16 and a set of vertical spaced channels 17 which are orientated perpendicular to each other and each set is substantially parallel to a pair of opposite edges of the porous board. It is readily seen that one can locate a continuous channel egress from substantially any part of each channel to the bottom of the board. For example, from point A of channel 16 one could trace a horizontal path to point B at the conjunction of channels 16 and 17 and then a vertical path to point C. Figure 5B illustrates a channel pattern formed by two sets of spaced channels, each set being perpendicular to the other and diagonal with respect to the vertical edges of the porous board. Here again one can trace a continuous channel egress path from substantially any part of each channel to the bottom of the board. For example, from point D of channel 18 one can form a path shown by dash lines among several of the channels of the two sets of channels to arrive at the bottom egress point E.The diagonal pattern permits the liquid to cascade downward and away from the barrier and structural surface it protects and, therefore, is a preferred configuration. Figure 5C is of a similar channel pattern to that of Figure 5B except that one diagonal set of channels 18 is located on and open to one major surface of board 2 and the other diagonal set of channels 19 is located on and open to the second major surface of board 2 . When channels are located on opposite sides of board 2 the channels should be of a depth of greater than half, preferably from 0.51 to 0.75, the thickness of board 2 and be of a pattern such that each channel on the board s first surface crosses over at least one channel on the board s second surface to thus form an opening 20 between channels 18 and 19 at the points where the channels cross.Such a pattern permits the formation of more channels per board without detracting from the strength of the composite barrier. Referring to Figure 6, when the barrier is supplied in the form of a bituminous sheet and porous board which are coextensive as shown in Figure 2 and 2A, it is applied to the surface 23 of the structure to be protected after removing the protective coating 10 . In the same manner the protective coating on the sheet of another barrier 1 is removed to expose its adhesive sheet, and this barrier is positioned and applied to the structural surface adjacent the previously applied barrier. The steps are repeated until the entire surface is covered. The barriers are placed adjacent to and in contact with previously layed barriers. Such placement of barriers formed causes each of the edge surfaces 12 to butt up against an adjacent edge surface 12 .Due to the adhesive property of each sheet and the ability to flow to a small degree even under ambient temperatures, the abutting edges will self adhere, form a water tight seal and form a unitary waterproofing membrane structure over the entire structural surface to which it is applied. Referring to Figure 8, the barriers which have two adjacent edges of the sheet extended beyond the porous board as in Figure 3 can be applied to structural surfaces in a manner to cause overlapped seams. Such barriers are applied in the same manner as described above, followed by removing the protective coating 14 from the extended first major surfaces 8A . One then applies a second barrier 1 to the exposed extended first surface 8A of the sheet 7 of the first barrier 1 and to the adjacent structural surface so that the porous boards of the first and second barriers are adjacent to and in contact with each other at seam 18, and so that the sheet 7 of the second barrier 1 is adjacent to the porous board 2 of the first barrier 1 at seam 26. The sheets of the first and second barriers will thereby overlap. The protective coating of the extended portion of the first surface of the second barrier s sheet component is removed.The process is repeated until the surface of the structure to be protected is covered. This provides overlap seams between each of the applied barrier sheet components with extended adhesive to adhesive contact to assure waterproof seams and form a unitary membrane structure. The barrier of this embodiment can be applied to form a substantially flat total structure if the porous board of the barrier has edge areas 19 in which it is less thick. In other words, in an area extending for a distance about equal to or greater than the extended sheet width dimension, as from about 1 to 10 inches 2.5 to 25cms , from any of the porous board s edges not associated with an extended membrane portion, the second major surface 5 of the porous board is substantially planar but the first surface is stepped to be in closer spacial relationship at the edge portion 19 than otherwise. This will form an indenture preferably about equal to the thickness of a sheet component of the barrier used to accommodate the overlap of the two sheets. Figure 7 illustrates a typical application of the barrier of the type illustrated by Figure 4C, to a structural surface, such as a foundation wall 22 . The barrier 1 is placed on the exterior surface 23 of wall 22 with the adhesive sheet 7 of the barrier in contact with surface 23 . The sheets 7 of all of the applied barriers together form a waterproofing coating to the wall, while the porous boards form an exterior insulation. The exterior surface adjacent backfill of the barriers provides, via the grooves 15 , drainage and removal of any water forming adjacent to the wall, and prevents buildup of hydrostatic pressure. The water drains to the bottom of the barrier which is in contact with the base of the wall and where a small amount of gravel 24 and drainage pipe 25 is placed in conventional manner to carry water away. Figures 6A and 8A are cross sectional views of barriers having channels in the porous body surface as applied to structural surfaces as in Figure 7 with the interior surface being the lower surface of each figure.Referring first to Figure 6A, a barrier having a bituminous sheet and porous board which are coextensive as shown inFigure 4A is applied to the surface 23 of the structure 22 in just the same way as the barriers shown inFigure 6. Any water collecting adjacent to the wall adjacent coating 11 will be removed by the channels 15 to prevent the formation of hydrostatic pressure and associated damage. Figure 8A is a cross sectional view of the barrier of Figure 4C, with an additional preferred variation, applied to a surface 23 of structural wall 22. It is applied in the same way as the barriers of Figure 8 and also has the same preferred edge region 19 where the porous board has lesser thickness as is described above in connection with Figure 8. The barrier may have adhesive sheets extending beyond the board edges on opposite sides or on all sides.They can then be positioned so that one of its sheet s extended edges is up to the porous board of the previous barrier and so that there is an overlap seam. The exposed overlap seams can then be covered with filler sections formed from porous board of the same or similar type used to form the barrier The filler sections should be of a thickness approximately equal to the thickness of the barrier less twice the thickness of the barrier s sheet component. Alternatively, certain filler sections of any one barrier can be supplied as part of a barrier temporarily adhered to half of the extended sheet surfaces. These sections thereby act as a guide to aid in applying the barrier to adjacent barriers of proper spacing. Each filler section can be removed to permit rolling of the overlap adhesive sheets to ensure forming of a watertight seal therebetween and then replaced in the vacant space.The temporary adhesion of each filler section to the extended sheet can be done by applying a release film to the surface of the filler section initially in contact with the adhesive membrane and then reapplying the filler section with the release film treated surface away from the sheet membrane. Other methods can be readily determined.The resultant structure will thereby be substantially flat.
