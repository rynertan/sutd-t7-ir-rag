# Dental implant.

## Abstract
In a dental prosthesis having a post stem, 22 a neck 24 and a head, 26 , the stem has a terminal segment 41 at the end opposite the head and an intermediate segment 43 with an uneven surface between the terminal portion and the head. The radial extremities of the uneven surface extend precisely to the contour of a right circular cone 44 tapering in the terminal direction, and the radial extremities of the outer surface of terminal portion extend radially outward beyond the contour of this cone. A socket is drilled into the alveolar bone using a drill bit having the same conical taper that the extremities of the uneven surface follow. The prosthesis is inserted into the socket with some pressure so that the terminal portion deforms the alveolar bone only at the deep end of the socket, locking the prosthesis into the socket and bringing the extremities of the uneven surface into firm surface contact with the wall of the socket.
