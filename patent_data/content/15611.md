# Spectrophotometer.

## Abstract
A dual beam spectrophotometer includes a radiation chopper 5 and a monochromator 3 which includes a diffraction grating driven by a stepper motor. The chopper 5 includes a gate pulse generator 24 which produces gate pulses G A stepper motor drive circuit 134 produces pulses to step the stepper motor which are synchronised with the chopping cycle by means of the G A further condition which is preferably satisfied is that the first pulse of a sequence should start in the opposite half of the chopping cycle from that in which the first pulse started in a previous chopping cycle. At low stepping rates the motor will step twice in one chopping cycle and then pause for several cycles before again stepping twice.
