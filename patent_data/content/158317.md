## Description
The present invention is broadly concerned with a method for producing a higly useful biologic through the viral immunization of an animal such as a goat. More particularly, it is concerned with such a production method, along with a method of treating mammals using the biologic, wherein, in preferred forms, the goat or other test animal is treated with a parvovirus which is immunosuppressive in a permissive host. Vaccines have been in use since Edward Jenner 1749 1823 first recognized that people exposed to non virulent strains of microorganisms could be protected against infection by the related virulent strains. His vaccination of patients with exudate of cowpox sores provided those same patients with partial protection against smallpox. Numerous vaccines, have subsequently been prepared and used in both humans and animals. Immunization has been accomplished by vaccination with a suspension of live, attenuated, or killed organisms or specific protein, glycoprotein or surface material from various bacteria, rickettsiae, or virusus. These would include vaccines against anthrax, rabies, typhoid, cholera, smallpox, measles, mumps, pertussis, plague, and polio. The vaccine in each case has been intended to provide protection against a specific pathogen. While vaccination may provide long term specific protection it may or may not produce short term immunosystem modulation. The immune system responds to challenge via vaccination or infection by increased activity. This may result in the short term production of antigen non specific immunoregulatory modulators such as interferon, interleukins, and other various lymphokines. The rationale for a system that becomes active only in response to a specific challenge is simple. If the immune system operated at a high pitch of activity all the time, it would age prematurely and no longer provide the systematic protection it was evolved to deliver. Another possible complication with an unusually active immune system could be the initiation of auto immune reactions in which the system starts acting against itself, resulting in the destruction of normal tissue. Arthritis is exemplary of this particular condition. Increased activity of the immune system by virtue of improper regulation could furthermore result in an inability to ellicit an appropriate response. As an example, a massive response to a splinter in a finger would be completely inappropriate, just as no response to a major infection would be equally inappropriate. Immunomodulation may provide a regulatory directed approach at self healing, particularly with respect to such intractable diseases as cancer. For this to occur two minimal criteria must be met. The immune system must be sufficiently intact to respond to the regulator s , and secondly, the system under appropriate stimulation must have T cells, B cells and Natural Killer cells present that are capable of responding to the target antigen s or cell s . In such an instance, however, a nonspecific immunomodulator could potentially serve to turn on the immune system and initiate healing. A number of immunomodulators have previously been isolated and described and these appear to belong to one of three general groups, namely the interferons, the interleukins and the corticosteroids and leukotrienes. The interferons are a family of glyco proteins normally produced in response to a viral infection and are produced by leukocytes and fibroblasts. There are three main types, alpha, beta and gamma. They have molecular weights in the range of 15,000 to 40,000 daltons. Recently they have been produced by recombinant DNA techniques. The interferons have been found to have an absolute specie specificity, and are only effective in the specie that produced it. The second group of immunomodulators are the interleukins. They are a family of glyco proteins that are produced by white cells. It is believed that the lymphokines cause the activation of Natural Killer cells and B cells, and act in the initiation and propagation of the specific sequences of cellular interactions that are now recognized as the immune response. These growth promoters and activators participate in the generation of immunoreactive cells. The lymphokines are antigen non specific in that they activate all T and B cells in anticipation of the presentation of an antigen or a cell. The apparent molecular weights are in the range of 15,000 50,000 daltons. The third type of regulators are the corticosteroids and the leukotrienes, which act as regulators in inflammation. When produced in atypical amount, the leukotrienes can cause immediate type hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. They are principally oxygenated products of archidonic acid. In contrast the corticosteroids decrease immune system activity. Both corticosteroids and leukotrienes are small molecular weight compounds in comparison to the interleukins and interferons. All of the immulogical regulators produced commercially are extracts or concentrates of tissue culture fluids from mitogen stimulated lymphoid and myleloid cells. The exception to this had been the IL 2 which has been produced by genetic engineering. The other immulogical modulators that have been artificially produced are the interferons. The difficulty with each of these production methods is that the individual reagents being produced do not reproduce the plethoric effect seen Cardiovascular disease is one of the principal causes of death in the United States, accounting for approximately one million deaths a year. One of the main contributory factors to the development of coronary heart disease is the presence of high levels of serum cholesterol. While serum cholesterol concentrations may be altered by diet, in humans the majority of cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and then distributed by low density lipoproteins. As a consequence, control of serum cholesterol concentrations solely by diet alone is very difficult if not impossible. Currently there is only one medication, Cholestyramine, that has proven to be effective in lowering high serum cholesterol concentrations. Cholestyramine is an anion exchange resin that binds bile acids, resulting in a decreased reabsorption of the bile acids and the associated dietary cholesterol that they would normally carry back via the liver portal system. While use of Cholestyramine is indicated in certain patients, its use is limited because it may cause further increases in the serum triglyceride levels. The present invention is broadly concerned with a unique method for the production of a biologic useful as an immunomodulator moreover, it has been found that the biologic also serves to significantly decrease serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in patients. Broadly stated, the method of the invention comprises the steps of injecting a parvovirus into an animal, and permitting the injected animal to react to the presence of the virus for a period of time being at least one month in order to develop in the animal s blood serum biologic in sufficient quantity and or activity that 50 microliters of the animal s serum, when added to an In particularly preferred forms of the invention, the animal in question is a goat, and the Parvovirus injected is of a type which is immunosuppressive in a normal permissive host animal e.g. a cat or dog for the Parvovirus. Thus, in the presently preferred method of the invention, use is made of a normally immunosuppressive parvovirus in a non permissive host for the virus quite surprisingly however, this serves to develop an immunostimulative biologic in the injected animal s serum which has the salutory effects outlined above. In other forms of the invention, the injected animal can be selected from the group consisting of goats, horses, sheep, rabbits and monkeys, with the period of time after injection of the virus being at least about one month. The injected and immunized animal s serum can be used in relatively crude form, such as after only conventional ammonium sulfate fractionation. In other instances, however, the fractionated serum is subjected to further isolation procedures, in order to substantially purify the biologic. In actual practice, a number of test goats are normally immunized with Parvovirus, and the serum of these goats is tested after an appropriate time e.g. about 3 months for the presence of biologic using the standard outlined above. Those animals which are positives, i.e., their serum exhibits the biologic in the manner defined, are then bled and their serum, containing the biologic, is recovered. The biologic of the invention can be used for a wide variety of mammals such as man and domesticated animals in order to obtain beneficial results. Figures 1 3 are respectively chromatography profiles developed as a result of first stage, second stage and third stage column chromatographies of ammonium sulfate fractionated Parvovirus immunized positive goat serum in accordance with the preferred method of the invention. The following examples set forth the most preferred method of producing biologic in accordance with the invention, along with a number of examples showing treatment of mammals with the biologic. This example sets forth the preferred procedures for the production and recovery of the biologic of the present invention. A total of five normal goats were initially hypervaccinated with Parvovirus in multiple sites on their dorsal rear halves, using a total of 1 cc. of commercially available Feline Pan Leukopenia vaccine Dellen Laboratories, Inc., Westwood, Maine . Thereafter, at intervals of about one and two months after the initial injection, each goat was again injected with 1 cc. total quantities of Canine Origin Parvovirus vaccine Fromm Laboratories, Inc., Grafton, Wisconsin or Duramune Vaccine, Temple Texas . At the end of about three months from the date of the initial injection, a sample of whole blood was withdrawn from the carotid artery of the neck of each goat, and the samples treated as hereinafter described. The goat blood samples were separately centrifuged about 500 ml. at a time using a swinging bucket rotor centrifuge operated at 2000 rpm for 45 minutes to pellet the red blood cells. The plasma was then removed from the packed red cells in each sample, and volumetrically measured. An absorbance reading 280 nm of each plasma sample diluted 1 50 with PBS pH 7.5 was then taken for record purposes. 1.0 molar Calcium Chloride Use 1.0 ml of 1. molar calcium chloride for each 100 ml of plasma. Use 100 ul of thrombin for each 100 ml of plasma. An The above described The three positive serum samples were each further treated as described below the procedure for only a single serum sample is set forth, but the method of treating all the samples was the same . In this example, the respective positive serum samples were treated separately however, such samples could be pooled if desired. Ammonium Sulfate Sigma S 5182, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri As is evident from the foregoing, after a determination is made for the positive serum samples i.e., those containing adequate amounts of biologic successive fractionation and separation techniques may be employed to obtain the relatively purified biologic material, with appropriate assays being performed on separated fractions in order to ensure that the biologic is retained throughout. The final biologic product comprises proteinaceous component s which have not to date been completely characterized. However, the product is presently believed to be an interleukin protein or proteins having an apparent molecular weight in the range of 100,000 to 120,000 daltons the components also appear to be glycosylated. A sample of the purified biologic made in accordance with the present invention has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection such sample has been accorded accession number 40105. Obviously, however, there is no desire to be bound to any preliminary to partial characterizations, and such are offered only in an effort to disclose all presently available pertinent information. While the above described separation and isolation procedures are in many cases preferred, it should be understood that the biologic product derived from the methods of the invention can be used without such purifications, particularly if used in connection with animals. In the latter case, the fractionated positive goat serum can be used, inasmuch as such a relatively crude material contains the desired proteinaceous component s , while potentially interfering interleukins have been removed. A female cancer patient was treated with a purified biologic produced in accordance with Example I on five occasions. The injections were I.V. in 10 cc of saline. The first three treatments were on three consecutive days. A total of 150 micrograms of the biologic was given in three 3 evenly divided doses. Two weeks later the patient was treated with 2 mg of the purified biologic in two 2 evenly divided doses on two 2 consecutive days. The patient s serum was obtained on multiple occasions end analyzed for cholesterol and triglyceride content. No adverse side effects were noted in the patient. The data are presented in Table 1 This test demonstrated a substantial decrease in serum cholesterol levels, although there was no decrease in triglyceride concentration with this patient. A female rabbit was treated for one week with the biologic. In this instance, however, the material tested had been purified only through the ammonium sulfate fractionation and the first stage chromatography steps described in Example I thus the biologic was in a relatively crude, unpurified form. The rabbit was injected daily with 0.25 ml of the crude biologic for five consecutive days. The biologic was administered by I.V. in the ear vein. Blood for analysis was collected from an ear vein of the rabbit and allowed to clot. The serum was analyzed on a Technicon Instruments SMAC analyzer. A sample was drawn the day the experiment began to establish a baseline. The data are presented in Table 2. Food and water were provided This example demonstrates a reduction in both cholesterol and triglyceride concentration in the rabbit, using the crude biologic of the invention. This test demonstrated that the biologic of the invention acts as an immunomodulator by stimulating viable stem cells in the dog this result is confirmed by the large increase in WBC experienced subsequent to treatment, and the apparent cure effected. Normal human lymphocytes were first isolated using conventional techniques by centrifugation in a density media of Ficoll Histopaque. The separated white cells were next suspended in tissue culture media RPMI 1640 containing 10 fetal calf serum and then pipetted into tissue culture flasks 2 mls flask . Twenty five microliters of the crude, ammonium sulfate fractionated, goat derived biologic produced as described in Example I was then added to each test flask. The cultures were then incubated for 3 days and washed with saline. The cells in each culture were then resuspended in phosphate buffered saline and stained with fluorescene labeled mouse anti helper OKT 4 or mouse anti suppressor OKT 8 monoclonal antibody Ortho Diagnostic, Raritan, New Jersey. The stained cells were then analyzed on the 50 H Cytofluorograph. Control flasks were also provided which isolated cells suspended in equal amounts of the RPMI 1600 FCS media, plus an amount of non immunized normal goat sera equal in volume to the volume of biologic added to the test cultures. The data from this experiment are presented in Table 4 This A terminally ill cancer patient was treated with the purified biologic described in Example I. A whole blood sample was collected from the patient before her first treatment, and the patient was tested by skin scratch test for hyper reaction to the goat derived biologic prior to treatment. The first course of therapy involved injection of fifty 50 micrograms of purified stimulant diluted to a total volume of 10 cc. in saline solution given each day for three successive days, starting on December 19. The saline biologic was given by slow intravenous push. The patient was sampled again after the third treatment. The fourth and fifth treatments were identical and given on January 4 and January 5. On January 6 the patient was finally sampled. The samples were collected using a vaccutainer containing EDTA. All of the blood samples were stained with OKT 4, OKT 8 or LEU 7 monoclonal antibodies Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA. and then directly analyzed on the 50H cytofluorograph in order to count the T helper, T suppressor and Natural Killer cells present. The data is presented below, and is reported as percent of the total lymphocyte population. At the end of the therapy the patient had noted no unusual qualitative differences during the treatment period. The major change that occurred during treatment was a 2.5 fold increase in the patient s Natural Killer cell population. This Natural Killer population has been demonstrated to be active against virally active cells and tumor cells. Accordingly, the biologic served as an immunostimulant in the patient. A herd of 109 sheep infected with footrot was treated with the crude, ammonium sulfate fractionated goat derived biologic produced in accordance with the method of Example I. Fiftynine of the sheep presented clinical symptoms of footrot, with the animals in the most advanced stages of the disease being unable to walk. These animals were missing a substantial portion of their footpads due to the disease, and were forced to crawl on their knees. All of the 109 sheep in the herd were given a single intramuscular injection of the goat derived biologic, and the sheep were then observed daily thereafter for 10 days. Each sheep was given a dose of 1 cc. of the crude biologic. Following treatment, no new cases of footrot occurred. Within 10 days the animals previously unable to walk were up and walking again. On observation, the footpads of these animals were no longer red and wet, and a new footpad was growing and appeared to be whitish in color. The flock has subsequently been observed for an additional 30 days, with no recurrence of symptomatic footrot, and it is believed on the basis of this evidence that a cure was effected.
