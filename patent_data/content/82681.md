The presence of undesired vegetation causes substantial damage to useful crops, especially agricultural products that satisfy man s basic food needs, such as soybeans, barley, wheat, and the like. The current population explosion and concomitant world food shortage demand improvements in the efficiency of producing these crops. Prevention or minimizing the loss of a portion of valuable crops by killing, or inhibiting the growth of undesired vegetation is one way of improving this efficiency. A wide variety of materials useful for killing, or inhibiting controlling the growth of undesired vegetation is available such materials are commonly referred to as herbicides. The need exists, however, for still more effective herbicides that destroy or retard weeds without causing significant damage to useful crops.

Synthesis Many of the compounds of Formulae I, II or III may be prepared as shown in Equation 1 by the reaction of an appropriately substituted sulfonyl isocyanate, L1SO2NCO IV wherein L1 is a radical selected from EMI10.1 and the appropriate heterocyclic amine RlRloNH V R,R1, R8, Rg and R10 being as previously defined.Equation 1EMI10.2 The reaction of Equation 1 is generally carried out by adding a solution of the sulfonyl isocyanate IV in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride or acetonitrile to a suspension or solution of the heterocyclic amine V in the same solvent under anhydrous conditions. Since the sulfonyl isocyanate IV is usually a liquid or readily soluble in the solvent used, it is usually convenient to add this to a suspension or solution of the amine. The mixture is then stirred from one to sixteen hours at temperatures from ambient to the reflux temperature of the solvent used. In some cases, the reaction is exothermic and the products crystallize from the reaction mixture on cooling.When the product is soluble in the reaction medium it can be isolated by evaporation of the solvent and trituration with a suitable solvent such as l chlorobutane, hexane or similar non polar solvent. Sulfonyl isocyanates can be prepared by the reaction of sulfonamides of structure IVa with phosgene in the presence of an alkyl isocyanate such as butyl isocyanate in an inert solvent, such as chlorobenzene or xylene, by the procedure of H. Ulrich andA. A. Y. Sayigh Newer Methods of Preparative OrganicChemistry, Vol. VI, p. 223 41, Academic Press, NewYork and London, W. Foerst, Ed. as shown by Equation 2.Equation 2 L1SO2NH2 COCK2 IVa EMI11.1 L1SO2NCO IV An alternative procedure for the preparation of the sulfonylureas of this invention is via the reaction of a carbamate of structure IVb with a heterocyclic amine V by the procedure of W. Meyer andW. Fory, EPO 44,807 as shown in Equation 2a.Equation 2aEMI11.2 The carbamates of structure IVb can be prepared by methods also described by M. Meyer and W. Fory op.cit . Alternatively, many of the sulfonylureas of this invention may be prepared by the reaction of sulfonamides of Formula IVa with heterocyclic isocyanates ofFormula Va followed by replacement of the active halogens on the hetero ring as shown by the sequence inEquation 3.Equation 3EMI12.1 In Equation 3, L1 and Z are as previously defined, Y1 is OCH3, OC2H5, NH2, NHCH3 or N CH3 2 and M is H or an alkali metal cation. In Reaction Step 3a , an appropriately substituted sulfonamide is reacted with a heterocyclic isocyanate of Formula Va to yield a sulfonylurea of Formula VIa. The heterocyclic isocyanates used in Reaction 3a may be prepared according to the method described in Swiss Patent 579,062 U.S. Patent 3,919,228, U.S. Patent 3,732,223 and Angew Chem. Int. Ed., 10, 402 1976 , the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. In Reaction Step 3a , an appropriately substituted sulfonamide is contacted with a heterocyclic isocyanate of Formula Va in the presence of an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, acetone or butanone. Optionally, a catalytic amount of a base such as 1,4 diaza bicyclo 2.2.2 octane DABCO , potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide may be added to the reaction mixture. In Reaction Steps 3b and 3c , one or two of the chlorine atoms on the pyrimidinyl or triazinyl ring of the compound of Formula VIa is displaced by an alcohol or amine 3c . Generally, this may be done by contacting the compound of Formula VIa with methanol or methoxide. Thus, in Reaction Step 3b , a compound of Formula VIa may be contacted with at least one equivalent of methanol. This reaction is sluggish, however, and it is preferred to contact the compound of Formula VIa with at least two equivalents of sodium methoxide in acetonitrile, THF or dimethylformamide. It should be noted that two equivalents of methoxide are required for Reaction Step 3b whereas only one equivalent of methanol is needed for the same process. When methoxide is used, the first equivalent of base removes a proton from the sulfonyl nitrogen, and it is only the second equivalent which effects displacement of the halogen. As a result, two equivalents of methoxide are required. The resulting salt must be acidified, e.g., with sulfuric, hydrochloric or acetic acid, to yield a compound of Formula VIb. Applicant, of course, does not intend to be bound by the mechanism described above. In Reaction Step 3c , a compound of Formula VIb is contacted with either one equivalent of alkanol,CH30H or C2H50H, or with two equivalents of alkoxide,CH30 or C2H50 or two equivalents of NH3, H2NCH3 or HN CH3 2 to give sulfonylureas of Formula VIc. The compounds of Formulae Ia and IIa can be prepared by one of the methods described below inEquations 4 and 5. As shown in Equation 4, compounds of Formula Ib can be prepared by reaction of the sulfonamide of Formula VII with an appropriate methyl heterocyclic carbamate of Formula VIII in the presence of an equimolar amount of trimethylaluminum, wherein R1l, R12, R1o, W1, W and R1 are as previously defined.Equation 4EMI14.1 The reaction of Equation 4 takes place in methylene chloride at reflux or ambient temperature for 16 96 hours under an inert atmosphere. The product can be isolated after the sequential addition of aqueous acetic acid and hydrochloric acid to the reaction mixture followed by the partitioning of the product into methylene chloride. The product can be purified via crystallization from such solvents as n butyl chloride, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, or methylene chloride or by silica medium pressure liquid chromatography.

The pyrimidine intermediates XIX shown below in which X1 is methyl have been reported in the literature by E. Bisagni et al., Bul. Soc. Chim. Fr., 803 1969 . An apparently more efficient procedure is depicted in the following sequence of reactions.EMI37.1 The keto ester precursors XVII are prepared by well known literature methods, e.g., J. F. Tinker andT. E. Whatmough, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 74, 5235 1952 . Treatment of XVII with an excess of guanidine carbonate in an organic solvent, preferably a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide DMSO , dimethylformamide DMF , or N,N dimethylacetamide, at a temperature of 800 to 2000, preferably 1000 to 1600, ambient pressure and preferably under an inert atmosphere, yields both XIX and XVIII as products. The products are isolated upon dilution of the reaction mixture with, for example, acetone and water successively. Higher reaction temperatures and longer reaction times e.g., in DMSO at 1300 1500 for 2 to 8 hours favor the production of the furopyrimidine XIX over the uncyclized pyrimidine XVIII. Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds ofFormulae I and II are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by contacting compounds of Formulae I and II with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g. hydroxide, alkoxide, carbonate or hydroxide . Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formulae I, Ia, II, IIa orIII can also be prepared by exchange of one cation to another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct treatment of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formulae 1, Ia, II, Ila or III e.g., alkali metal or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water, e.g., a copper salt, and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of FormulaeI, Ia, II, IIa or III e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged. In this method, the cation of the resin is exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is watersoluble, e.g., a potassium, sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formulae I,Ia, II, IIa or III with a suitable acid, e.g., p tolu enesulfonic acid, trichloroacetic acid or the like. The compounds of this invention and their preparation are further illustrated by the following examples wherein temperatures are given in degrees centigrade and all parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated.

compounds of FormulaI, Ia, II, IIa or III can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid diluent s .More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table VI Weight Percent Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a Surfactant or a Diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, NewJersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents and EmulsifiersAnnual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of SurfaceActive Agents, Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., NewYork, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning, Agglomeration , Chemical Engineering, December 4, 1967, pp. 147ff. and Perry1s ChemicalEngineer s Handbook , 5th Ed., McGraw Hill, New York, 1973, pp. 8 57ff.

They have utility for broadspectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunitibn depots, industrial storage areas, parking lots, drivein theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Alternatively, the subject compounds are useful for the selective pre and or post emergence weed control in crops, such as cotton, wheat, and barley. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as selective or general herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.125 to 10 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for selective weed control or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate, acetanilide, dinitroaniline, phenolic and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow.Test A Seeds of crabgrass Digitaria sp. , barnyard grass Echinochloa crusgalli , wild oats Avena fatua , sicklepod Cassia obtusifolia , morningglory lpomoea sp. , cocklebur Xanthium sp. , sorghum, corn, soybean, rice, wheat and nutsedge tubers Cyperus rotundus were planted in a growth medium and treated pre emergence with the chemicals dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent solution of the compounds of Table A.At the same time, cotton having five leaves including cotyledonary ones , bush beans with the third trifoliolate leaf expanding, crabgrass, barnyardgrass and wild oats with two leaves, sicklepod with three leaves including cotyledonary ones , morningglory and cocklebur with four leaves including the cotyledonary ones , sorghum and corn with four leaves, soybean with two cotyledonary leaves, rice with three leaves, wheat with one leaf, and nutsedge with three five leaves were sprayed with a non phytotoxic solvent solution of the compounds of Table A. Other containers of the above mentioned weeds and crops were treated pre or post emergence with the same non phytotoxic solvent so as to provide a solvent control. A set of untreated control plants was also included for comparison.Pre emergence and post emergence treated plants and controls were maintained in a greenhouse for sixteen days, then all treated plants were compared with their respective controls and rated visually for response to treatment. The following rating system was used 0 no effect 10 maximum effect A accelerated growth C chlorosis and or necrosis D defoliation E emergence inhibition G growth retardation H formative effects S albinism U unusual pigmentation X axillary stimulation 6Y abscised buds or flowers and 6F delayed flowering.
