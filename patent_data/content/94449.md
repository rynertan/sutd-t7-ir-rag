## Description
SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR AN AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to a speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle, and more particularly to a speech recognition system by which a plurality of predetermined spoken instructions are selectively recognized according to vehicle travelling conditions. Description of the Prior Art Conventionally, there is well known a speech recognizer which can activate various actuators in response to human spoken instructions. When this speech recognizer is mounted on a vehicle, the headlight, for instance, can be turned on or off by the driver s spoken instruction such as Headlight on or Headlight off . Such a speech recognizer usually can recognize various spoken instructions in order to control various actuators however, there are some problems involved in applying this system to an automotive vehicle.In the case where the speech recognizer is so designed as to activate a door opening mechanism in response to the driver s spoken instruction, for example, Door open , if some passengers have a conversation including the phrase Door open while the vehicle is travelling, a dangerous situation may occur in that all the vehicle doors will open while the vehicle is travelling at high speed. Therefore, generally, there is provided a recognition switch which allows spoken instructions to be inputted to the speech recognizer only while this switch is depressed even so, from the standpoint of safety spoken phrase such as Door open should not be recognized by the speech recognizer at all while the vehicle is travelling.On the other hand, there are some spoken instructions, for instance, such as Headlight high beam which are usually used only while the vehicle is travelling and, of course, there are many spoken instructions such as Air conditioner on off , Radio on off , Channel 3 etc., which are used regardless of vehicle s travelling conditions. Furthermore, from the standpoint of improvement in recognition performance, it is desirable to reduce the number of spoken instructions. A more detailed description of a typical speech recognizer will be made with reference to the attached drawing in conjunction with the present invention underDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION With these problems in mind therefore, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide a speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle by which a plurality of actuators for conducting some necessary functions in an automotive vehicle can selectively be activated according to vehicle travelling conditions, in such a way that a spoken instruction such as Door open is recognized only when vehicle speed is zero, Headlight high beam is recognized only when vehicle speed reaches a fixed rate, and Air conditioner on is recognized regardless of vehicle speed. To achieve the above mentioned object, the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention comprises a speed sensor or the substitutes such as ignition switch sensor or shiftgear drive neutral position sensor, and a speed dependent speech selection unit including a plurality of AND gates or analog switches, in addition to the conventional speech recognizesBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The features and advantages of the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention will be more clearly appreciated from the following description taken in conjunction with the.accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals designate corresponding elements or sections throughout the drawings and in which Fig. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a typical speech recognizer for assistance in explaining the operations thereof Fig. 2 is a fragmentary schematic block diagram of a first embodiment of the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram of a first embodiment of a speed dependent speech selection unit for use in the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention Fig. 4 is a circuit diagram of a second embodiment of a speed dependent speech selection unit for use in the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention Fig. 5 is a schematic block diagram of a second embodiment of the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention Fig. 6 is a circuit diagram of a third embodiment of a speed dependent speech selection unit for use in the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention Fig. 7 is a circuit diagram of a fourth embodiment of a speed dependent speech selection unit for use in the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention and Fig. 8 is a schematic block diagram of a third embodiment of the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS To facilitate understanding of the present invention, a brief reference will be made to the principle or Operation of a typical prior art speech recognizert with reference to Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows a schematic block diagram of a typical speech recognizer 100. To use the speech recognizer, the user must first record a plurality of predetermined spoken instructions. Specifically, in this spoken instruction recording mode reference mode , the user first depresses a record switch 1 disposed near the user. When the record switch 1 is depressed, a switch input interface 4 detects the depression of the record switch 2 and outputs a signal to a controller 5 via a wire 4a. In response to this signal, the controller 5 outputs a recording mode command signal to other sections for presetting the entire speech recognizer in the recording mode. In the spoken instruction recording mode, when the user says a phrase to be used as a spoken instruction, such as open doors , near a microphone 2, the spoken phrase is transduced into corresponding electric signals through the microphone 2, amplified through a speech input interface 6, smoothed through a root mean square RMS smoother 15, and finally inputted to a voice detector 7. This voice detector 7 detects whether or not the magnitude of the spoken phrase signals exceeds a predetermined level for a predetermined period of time 150 to 250 ms in order to determine the start of the spoken phrase input signals and whether or not the magnitude of the signals drops below a predetermined level for a predetermined period of time in order to determine the end of the signals.Upon detection of the start of the signals, this voice detector 7 Outputs another recording mode command signal to the controller 5.In response to this command signal, the controller 5 activates a group of bandpass filters 8, so that the spoken phrase signals from the microphone 2 are divided into a number of predetermined frequency bands. Given to a parameter extraction section 9, the frequency divided spoken phrase signals are squared or rectified therein in order to obtain the voice power spectrum for each of the frequency bands and then converted into corresponding digital time series matrix phonetic pattern data.These data are next stored into a memory unit 10. In this case, however, since the speech recognizer is set to the spoken instruction recording mode by the depression of the record switch 1, the time series matrix phonetic pattern data are transferred to a reference pattern memory unit 11 and stored therein as reference data for recognizing the speech instructions. After having recorded the reference spoken instructions, the user can input speech instructions, for instance, such as open doors , to the speech recognizer through the microphone 2 while depressing a recognition switch 3. When this recognition switch 3 is depressed, the switch input interface 4 detects the depression of the recognition switch 3 and outputs a signal to the controller 5 via a wire 4b. In response to this signal, the controller 5 outputs a recognition mode command signal to other sections for presetting the entire speech recognizer in the recognition mode.In such spoken phrase recognition mode, when the user says an instruction phrase similar to the one recorded previously near the microphone 2 and when the voice detector 7 outputs a signal, the spoken instruction is transduced into corresponding electric signals through the microphone 2, amplified through the speech input interface 6, filtered and divided into voice power spectrum for each of the frequency bands through the band pass filters 8, squared or rectified and further converted into corresponding digital time series matrixphonetic pattern data through the parameter extraction section 9, and then stored in the memory unit 10, in the same manner as in the recording mode. Next, the time series matrix phonetic pattern data stored in the memory unit 10 in the recognition mode are sequentially compared with the time series matrixphonetic pattern data stored in the reference pattern memory unit 11 in the recording mode by a resemblance comparator 12. The resemblance comparator 12 calculates the resemblance rate of the inputted speech instruction to the reference speech instruction after time normalization and level normalization for compensating for variable speaking rate because the same person speaks fast and loudly at one time but slow and whisperingly at the other time . The resemblance rate is usually obtained by calculating Tchebycheff distance between recognition mode time series matrix phonetic pattern data and recording mode time series matrix phonetic pattern data.The resemblance rate calculated by the resemblance comparator 12 is next given to a resemblance determination section 13 to determine whether or not the calculated values lie within a predetermined range, that is, to evaluate their cross correlation. If within the range, a command signal, indicating that a recognition mode spoken instruction having adequate resemblance to one of the recorded instruction phrases, is outputted to one of actuators 14, for instance, in order to open the vehicle doors. Further, the above mentioned operations are all executed in accordance with command signals outputted from the controller 5. Description has been made hereinabove of the case where various discreate elements or sections are used for the speech recognizer 100 however, it is of course possible to realize the speech recognizer 100 by the use of a microcomputer including a central processing unit, a read only memory, a random access memory, a clock oscillator, etc. In such case, the voice detector 7, the parameter extraction section 9, the memory 10, the reference pattern memory 11, the resemblance comparator 12 and the resemblance determination section 13 can be all incorporated within the microcomputer, executing the same or similar processing, calculation or operations as already explained hereinabove. Additionally, the Tchebycheff distance is defined as follows In the case where the number of the bandpass filters is four and the number of time series data for each is 32, the digital recording mode time series matrixphonetic pattern data can be expressed asEMI9.1 where A designates a first recording mode speech instruction reference e.g. OPEN DOORS , i denotes the filter index, and j denotes time series data index. Here, if a first recognition mode speech instruction e.g. OPEN DOORS is indicated as B, theTchebycheff distance can be obtained from the following expression EMI9.2 In views of the above description and with reference to the attached drawings, the embodiments of the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention will be described hereinbelow. Fig. 2 shows a fragmentary schematic block diagram of a first embodiment of the speech recognition system according to the present invention. In the figure, the reference numeral 20 denotes a speed dependent speech selection unit for enabling or suppressing the reference matrix phonetic pattern data according to vehicle speed and the reference numeral 21 denotes a vehicle sensor for electrically, magnetically or optically detecting vehicle speed and outputting digital signals corresponding thereto. Furthermore, in this embodiment, the reference pattern memory 11 includes a plurality of reference pattern memory units lla, llb, llc, and Ild one for each instruction phrase. For instance, the time series matrix phonetic pattern data corresponding to Air conditioner on are stored in the unit lla. In brief summation of this embodiment, the command signal from the controller 5 is selectively applied to the respective reference pattern memory units lla to lld via the speech selection unit 20 according to the detected vehicle speed in order to control the speech recognition functions of the speech recognition system. Fig. 3 shows a first embodiment of the circuit configuration of the speech selection unit 20. In the figure, the reference numeral 22 denotes a frequencyvoltage converter f V converter for converting digital pulse signals from the vehicle sensor 21 into the corresponding analog voltage signals. The reference numerals 23 and 24 denote two comparators. The plus input terminal of the first comparator 23 is connected to an intermediate point of serially connected voltage division resistors to receive a reference voltage el and the minus input terminal of the first comparator 23 is connected to the F V converter 22.On the other hand, the plus input terminal of the second comparator 24 is connected to the F V converter 22 and the minus input terminal of the second comparator 24 is connected to another intermediate point of serially connected voltage division resistors to receive another reference voltage e2. The reference numeral 25 denotes a NOR gate, two input terminals of which are connected to the output terminals of the comparators 23 and 24, respectively. The reference numerals 27, 28 and 29 denote three AND gates, one of the two input terminals of each of which is connected to the output terminal of one of the comparators 23 or 24 or the NOR gate 25 and the other of two input terminals of all of which is connected to the controller 5.Further, the reference numeral 26 denotes a wire for directly connecting the first reference pattern memory unit Ila to the controller 5. Now, follows the operation of this speech selection unit. Since the frequency of the pulse signals detected by the speed sensor 21 is proportional to vehicle speed, it is possible to obtain analog voltages, the level of which is proportional to the vehicle speeds by converting the pulse signals into the corresponding voltage signals via the F V converter 22. These voltage signals are next compared with two reference voltages el and e2 by the two comparators 23 and 24, respectively.A first reference voltage el corresponding to a vehicle speed of, for instance, 1 km h can be determined by E Rl Rl R2 R3 while a second reference voltage e2 corresponding to a vehicle speed of, for instance, 5 km h can be determined by E Rl R2 Rl R2 R3 . Therefore, when vehicle speed drops below 1 km h, the first comparator 23 outputs a H voltage level signal when vehicle speed rises beyond 5 km h, the second comparator 24 outputs a H voltage level signal when vehicle speed lies between 1 to 5 km h, the NOR gate 25 outputs a H voltage level signal. On the other hand, when a spoken instruction is inputted to the speech recognition system in the recognition mode, since the controller 5 always outputs aH voltage level command signal to the speech selection unit 20, this command signal is applied from the controller 5 to one of the input terminals of the respective AND gates 27, 28 and 29. Therefore, in response to the command signal, one of the AND gates 2 , 28 or 29 associated with the current vehicle speed will outputs a H voltage level signal, so that the time series matrix phonetic pattern data stored in the respective reference pattern memory unit lla, and one of llb, llc and lld are transferred to the resemblance comparator 12 for comparison of the reference pattern data with those of an inputted spoken instruction. After the resemblance rate is calculated by the comparator 12, the actuator corresponding thereto is activated in response to the signal from the resemblance determination section 13. To explain more concretely, since spoken instructions such as Air conditioner on , Radio on and Channel 1 are stored in the first reference pattern memory unit ll a , these instructions can be transferred to the resemblance comparator 12 regardless of the vehicle speed. Further, since spoken instructions such as Door open and Trunk lid open are stored in the second reference pattern memory unit lib, these instructions can be transferred only when the vehicle speed is less than 1 km h. Further, since spoken instructions such as Headlight off are stored in the third reference memory unit lic, these instructions can be transferred only while the vehicle is moving at a speed between 1 and 5 km h.Finally, since spoken instructions such as nHeadlight highbeam are stored in the fourth reference pattern memory unit lid, these instructions can be transferred only while the vehicle is moving at a speed of more than 5 km h. In this embodiment, an analog signal representative of vehicle speed is compared with reference analog signals however, it is of course possible to compare a digital signal representative of vehicle speed with the reference digital signal to eliminate the need for the F V converter 22. In this case, the number of pulses counted in a predetermined period of time would be directly compared with a reference value. Fig. 4 shows a second embodiment of the circuit configuration of the speech selection unit 20. In the figure, the reference numeral 21 1 denotes an ignition switch sensor for outputting a H voltage level signal when an ignition switch is turned on, the reference numeral 21 2 denotes a drive position sensor for outputting a H voltage level signal when the gear shift of a transmission system is shifted into any of the 1st DRIVE, 2nd DRIVE, and REAR positions, that is, when the vehicle is travelling frontward or backward the reference numeral 21 3 denotes a neutral position sensor for outputting a H voltage level signal when the gear shift is in NEUTRAL position. The reference numerals 30 and 31 denote a fourth AND gate and a fifth AND gate, respectively. The reference numeral 32 denotes an inverter. Two input terminals of the fourth AND gate 30 are connected to the ignition switch sensor 21 1 and the neutral position sensor 21 3, respectively. Therefore, when the ignition switch is turned on and further the gear shift is shifted into the neutral position, since two input terminals of the fourth AND gate 30 are both at a H voltage level, the fourth AND gate 30 outputs a H voltage level signal indicating that the vehicle is travelling at a speed less than, for instance, five km hour. Two input terminals of the fifth AND gate 31 are connected to the ignition switch sensor 21 1 and the drive position sensor 21 2. Therefore, when the ignition switch is turned on and the gear shift is in the drive position, since two input terminals of the fifth AND gate 31 are both at a H voltage level, the fifth AND gate 31 outputs aH voltage level signal indicating that the vehicle is travelling at a speed of more than, for instance, five km hour. The input terminal of the inverter 32 is connected to the ignition switch sensor 21 2. Therefore, when the ignition switch is turned off, the output terminal of the inverter 32 is at a H voltage level signal indicating that the vehicle speed is zero. The operation of the AND gates 27, 28, and 29 is the same as in Fig. 3, and therefore the description thereof will be omitted. Fig. 5 shows a schematic block diagram of a second embodiment according to the present invention. In this embodiment, the speed dependent speech selection unit 20 including a first AND gate 27 and a third AND gate 29 is connected between the speech recognizer 100 and a plurality of vehicle actuators 14. That is to say, the vehicle speed is sensed by the speed sensor 21 and the sensed vehicle speeds are classified into appropriate groups in this embodiment, more or less than one meter per second by the speech selection unit 20.Therefore, only when the vehicle speed is less than one meter per second, actuator 14b for opening vehicle doors can be activated through the AND gate 27 only when the vehicle speed is more than one meter per second, the actuator 14d for switching headlights into the high beam condition can be activated through the AND gate 29 the actuator 14a for turning on an air conditioner can be activated, regardless of the vehicle speed. Fig. 6 shows a first embodiment of the circuit configuration of the speed dependent speech selection unit 20 excluding the AND gates 27 and 29. In the figure, the reference numeral 21 denotes a speed sensor for detecting vehicle speeds in the form of pulse signals the number of pulse signals per unit time of which is proportional to vehicle speed. The reference numeral 22 denotes a frequency voltage converter for converting the detected pulse signals from the vehicle sensor 21 into the corresponding voltage signals. The reference numeral 23 denotes a comparator, the minus input terminal of which is connected to the F V converter 22 and the plus input terminal of which is connected to the point of junction of two serially connected voltage division resistors R1 and R2 in order to receive a reference voltage.The reference numeral 33 denotes a transistor serving as an inverter. Returning to Fig. 5, the reference numeral 27 and 29 denote two AND gates one input terminal of each of which is connected to the speech recognizer 100 and the respective other input terminal of each of which is connected to the comparator 23 or the transistor 33, respectively. Now, follows the operation of this speech selection unit. Since the frequency of the pulse signals from the speed sensor 21 is proportional to vehicle speed, a voltage proportional to vehicle speed is outputted by the F V converter 22. The voltage signal is next compared with the reference voltage e0 by the comparator 23. The reference voltage e0 corresponding to a vehicle speed of, for instance, one meter per second can be determined by E R2 R1 R2 . Therefore, when vehicle speed is less than one meter per second, the comparator 23 outputs a H voltage level signal to One input terminal of the AND gate 27. On the other hand, when a correct spoken instruction is inputted to the speech recognizer 100 in recognition mode, the recognizer 100 outputs a H voltage level command signal to the AND gate 27 in response thereto. Therefore, an ANDed output signal is given to the second actuator 14b to drive, for instance, a mechanism to open the vehicle doors. Also, in this case, since the transistor 33 is on, the collector terminal thereof is at a L voltage level, so that the AND gate 29 is not activated. Similarly, when vehicle speed is more than one meter per second, since the comparator 23 outputs a L voltage level signal, the transistor 33 will be off, therefore the collector terminal thereof will be at a H voltage level. Thus, when a command signal is applied to the AND gate 29, it outputs an activating signal to the fourth actuator 14d to drive, for instance, a dimmer switch to switch a headlight into high beam condition. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5, since the first actuator 14a for driving, for instance, a switch to operate an air conditioner is directly connected to the speech recognizer 100, the first actuator 14a can be activated regardless of the vehicle speed. Fig. 7 shows a second embodiment of the circuit configuration of the speech selection unit 20 excluding theAND gates 27 and 29. In the figure, the reference numeral 21 1 denotes an ignition switch sensor which outputs aH voltage level signal when an ignition switch is turned on and a L voltage level signal when turned off. The reference numeral 21 3 denotes a drive position sensor which outputs a H voltage level signal when the gear shift of a transmission system is in any of the 1st DRIVE, 2ndDRIVE, and REVERSE positions, that is, when the vehicle is travelling frontward or backward and a L voltage level signal when the gear shift is in any of the above. The reference numeral 32 denotes an inverter and 31 denotes a fifth AND gate. Since the input terminal of the inverter 32 is connected to the ignition switch sensor 21 1, when the ignition switch is turned off, the output terminal thereof is at a H voltage level indicating that the vehicle speed is zero. Since the two input terminals of the AND gate 31 are connected to the ignition switch sensor 21 1 and the drive position sensor 21 3, when the ignition switch is turned on and the gear shift is in one of the driving positions, the AND gate 31 outputs a H voltage level signal indicating that the vehicle is travelling. The operations of the AND gates 27 and 29 are the same as in Fig. 5, therefore the description thereof will be omitted. Fig. 8 shows a schematic block diagram of a third embodiment according to the present invention. In this embodiment, the speed dependent speech selection unit 20 including three analog switches is connected between a plurality of microphones and the speech recognizer 100. In the figure, the reference numerals 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d denote a plurality of microphones through which a plurality of spoken instructions are inputted in recognition mode to the speech recognizer 100. The reference numerals 35, 36 and 37 denote analog switches which connect or disconnect the spoken instruction signals to or from the speech recognizer 190 in response to signals from the speech selection unit 20, such as is shown in Fig. 6. Since a H voltage level signal indicating that vehicle speed is less than one meter per second is applied from the comparator 23 shown in Fig. 6 to the analog switches 35 and 36, only when the vehicle speed is less than one meter per second, the analog switches 35 and 36 are closed, so that a specific set of spoken instructions, for instance, such as Driver side door open , can be inputted to the speech recognizer through the microphone 2b disposed on the inside surface of a driver side door and similarly a different spoken instruction, for instance, such as Passenger side door open , can be inputted to the speech recognizer through the microphone 2c disposed on the inside surface of a passenger side door. On the other hand, since a H voltage level signal indicating that the vehicle speed is more than one meter per second is inputted from the collector of the transistor 33 shown in Fig. 6 to the analog switch 37, only when the vehicle speed is more than one meter per second, the analog switch 37 is closed, so that a spoken instruction, for instance, such as Headlight high beam , can be inputted to the speech recognizer 100 through the microphone 2d disposed at the central portion of a steering wheel. Since the microphone 2a is directly connected to the speech recognizer 100, a spoken instruction, for instance, such as Air conditioner on , can be inputted to the speech recognizer 100 regardless of vehicle speed. Although various embodiments of the speed dependent speech selection units has been described hereinabove by using various discrete elements or sections, it is of course possible to incorporate the same functions within the microcomputer of the speech recognizer 100 as already explained. As described above, in the speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention, a plurality of vehicle actuators for conducting some necessary functions in an automotive vehicle can selectively be activated according to vehicle speed. Thus it is possible to reduce the number of reference matrix phonetic pattern data for each classified vehicle speed, thus improving reliability of recognition performance. Furthermore, it is possible to avert dangerous conditions, such as the vehicle doors opening while the vehicle is travelling, thus allowing more safe operation. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description is in terms of preferred embodiments of the present invention wherein various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as set forth in the appended claims.
