## Description
This invention relates to a vehicle lighting system. In conditions of bad visibility, many motorists drive with only the vehicle sidelights illuminated, whereas it is recommended by such bodies as the United Kingdom Ministry of Transport and motoring organisations that dipped beam headlamps should be used. In recent years, a number of vehicle systems have been developed which ensure that the sidelights cannot be energised when the ignition switch is turned on without the dipped beam filaments being energised also. More particularly, these systems incorporate a device operative to energise the dipped beam filaments automatically when the sidelights are energised and to de energise the dipped beam filaments automatically when the sidelights are subsequently de energised or when main beam filaments of the headlamps are energised. A typical example of such a system is disclosed in FR A 2497484, in accordance with the preamble of the present claim 1. In existing systems of this type, however, the aforesaid device energises the dipped beam filaments as soon as the ignition switch is closed, which imposes a considerable current drain on the vehicle battery. If the battery is already at a low charge level such as is often the case in winter when this particular system will be used the most , then the additional current drain imposed by the dipped beam filaments will make it difficult or even impossible to start the engine. It then becomes necessary to switch off the sidelights, which is not only dangerous for other motorists but may also be illegal. The present invention overcomes this problem by providing means which senses the voltage at a predetermined point in the charging circuit where the voltage varies as the speed of the engine increases and which activates the device only if the sidelights are energised and if the speed of the engine is sufficient to cause this voltage to pass through a preselected level. The dipped beam filaments do not therefore become energised until after the engine has been safely started, thereby avoiding premature current drain on the battery. In a first aspect, the present invention comprises the sensor means additionally to be responsive to a third voltage at a predetermined point in the side lights circuit, and by connecting the sensor means to this predetermined point by way of a diode which places a voltage clamp on the sensor means until the speed of the engine is sufficient to cause the first voltage to rise above a pre selected level the second voltage is at a level corresponding to the main beam filaments being de energised and the third voltage is above a level corresponding to the side lights being energised. In a second aspect, the present invention similarly arranges for the sensor means to be responsive to a third voltage at a pre determined point in the side lights circuit, and also arranges for the sensor means to be connected between that point and the main conduction path of a transistor whose base is connected to the ignition starting circuit. In this way, the voltage drop across the sensor means is insufficient to cause the switching means to operate unless the speed of the engine is sufficient to cause the first voltage to pass through a preselected level, the second voltage is at a level corresponding to the main beam filaments being de energised, and the third voltage is above a level corresponding to the side lights being energised. It is to be noted that a system described in DE A 1962093 employs sensor means in the form of a relay coil in the charging circuit, and switching means in the form of a relay contact connected at one side to the side lights circuit and at the other side to a point in the headlamps circuit. This latter point is a common terminal of the main dipped beam selector switch. Therefore, it is not necessarily the dipped beam filaments which will be energised with the side lights if the selector switch happens to be in the main beam position, then the main beam filaments will be energised instead. This will give rise to unwanted dazzle. Desirably, the lighting system comprises switch means which is manually operable to energise the dipped beam filaments of the headlamps, the dipped beam filaments being operated at substantially the same intensity when energised by said device as is the case when they are energised by said switch means. Alternatively, the dipped beam filaments may be operated at a reduced intensity when energised by said device than is the case when they are energised by said switch means, for example by connecting a resistance in series between said device and the dipped beam filaments, or where the dipped beam filaments are energised by means of a pulsed electrical signal by varying the mark space ratio of the pulses in said signal. As a further alternative, each headlamp can comprise a main beam filament, a first dipped beam filament which is energised by said device, and a second dipped beam filament which is energised by means of a manually operable switch, the first dipped beam filament being arranged to emit light at a lower intensity than the second dipped beam filament. Conveniently, the said device comprises an oscillator producing output pulses and a power switching circuit which is driven by the oscillator and which supplies pulses of electrical power to the dipped beam filaments. In this case, it is preferred that an initial output pulse from the oscillator is of longer duration than subsequent output pulses therefrom. The switching circuit can include first semiconductor switching means by means of which pulses are supplied to the dipped beam filaments when the latter are cold, and second semiconductor switching means by means of which pulses are supplied to the dipped beam filaments after the latter have heated up. In this case, the pulses supplied by the first semiconductor switching means are preferably reduced in power as compared with the pulses supplied by the second semiconductor switching means. A resistance can be provided in series between the first semiconductor switching means and the dipped beam filaments to limit the initial inrush current of the first semiconductor switching means. Desirably, a control terminal of the second semiconductor switching means is connected to the main conduction path of a semiconductor switching element, the switching element being rendered conductive in response to an increase in the voltage drop across the dipped beam filaments as the latter heat up. The control terminal of the switching element can also be connected to the main conduction path of a further semiconductor switching element, with a charging circuit preventing said further switching element from becoming conductive until a predetermined time delay after the first semiconductor switching means supplies an initial pulse to the dipped beam filaments. Advantageously, the system also comprises a control circuit which renders the power switching circuit inoperative in response to the dipped beam filaments being short circuited. This control circuit may include a charging unit which discharges when the second semiconductor switching means supplies a pulse to the dipped beam filaments and charges during the interpulse period, the time constant for such charging being substantially greater than the period of the output pulses from the oscillator, and a disabling circuit to disable the power circuit in the event that the charging circuit charges beyond a predetermined amount, corresponding to the second semiconductor switching means being out of operation for longer than the time normally taken for the dipped beam filaments to heat up. Preferably, a control terminal of the first semiconductor switching means is connected to the main conduction path of a semiconductor switching element, the output pulses from the oscillator are applied to a control terminal of the switching element, and the disabling circuit is arranged to render the switching element non conductive in the event of the charging circuit charging beyond said predetermined amount. In this case the disabling circuit can include a further semiconductor switching element having its main conduction path connected to the control terminal of the first mentioned switching element, the further switching element normally being non conductive but being rendered conductive by charging of the charging circuit beyond said predetermined amount. In an embodiment, the sensor means includes a relay having a coil and switch contacts which are electrically connected to the dipped beam filaments. Advantageously, a diode is connected electrically in parallel with the relay coil to suppress inductive voltages. Additionally or alternatively, a capacitor may be connected electrically in parallel with the relay switch contacts to suppress arcing. In the aforesaid embodiment, it is preferred that a first switch is operable to energise the sidelights and is connected electrically in series with the relay coil, a second switch is operable to energise selectively the main beam filaments and the dipped beam filaments, and the switch contacts of the relay are electrically connected between a power supply and a point between the second switch and the dipped beam filaments. The invention will now be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Referring first to Figure 1, the lighting system shown therein includes sidelights 10 only one shown and headlamps 11 each having a main beam filament 12 and a dipped beam filament 13. The sidelights 10 are electrically connected to a power supply derived from a battery of the vehicle by way of a switch 14, while the connection point referenced 15 between the sidelights and the switch 14, is electrically connected by way of a further switch 16 to a movable switch contact 17. The contact 17 is engageable selectively with a first fixed contact 19 which is connected to the main beam filaments 12 of the headlamps, and with a second fixed contact 18 which is connected to the dipped beam filaments 13. Operation of the switch 14 alone causes the sidelights 10 to be energised, while additional operation of the switch 16 causes either the main beam filaments 12 or the dipped beam filaments 13 to be energised, according to whether the movable contact 17 engages the fixed contact 18 or the fixed contact 19. Thus far described, the lighting system is entirely conventional. A relay coil 20 has one terminal 20 Contacts 28, which open and close according to the energisation state of the relay coil 20, are electrically connected between the power supply and a point 29 between the contact 18 and the dipped beam filaments 13 of the headlamps. The contacts 28 are normally open, but close when a current is passed through the relay coil 20. A diode 30 is connected electrically in parallel with the coil 20 to suppress inductive voltages when the contacts 28 open, while a capacitor 31 is connected electrically in parallel with the contacts 28 to suppress arcing. A fuse 32 is provided between the power supply and the contacts 28, while further fuses 33 and 33 The above described lighting system operates as follows. When the ignition switch 23 is initially closed with the sidelights 10 off i.e. the switch 14 open , a small voltage drop is developed across the alternator or dynamo 25 about 1.2v for a 12v power supply . This voltage drop remains low once the engine has been started and is merely idling, but rapidly increases to substantially the voltage of the power supply when the engine is accelerated. Although the relay coil 20 is supplied with electricity from the alternator or dynamo 25 during this procedure, as long as the sidelights 10 remain off the diode 21 will clamp the terminal 20 In a preferred arrangement for use with a 12v power supply, the relay has a nominal operating voltage of 6v, and the resistor 22 is chosen so as to have the same resistance as the relay coil 20. In practice, it is found that the contacts 28 close when the voltage across the relay coil 20 is only about 4.4v. Since the coil voltage is rising rapidly at this point, very positive operation of the contacts 28 occurs so that there is no chance of any contact sizzle. Although there is a high inrush current when the relay contacts 28 first close, the resultant momentary drop in voltage at the relay contacts will not affect the operation of the coil 20, since as mentioned previously the latter is supplied from the alternator or dynamo 25. The above description assumes that the switch 16 is open, so that neither filaments of the headlamps are already energised. If, under the above condition, the switch 16 and the switch contact 17 are operated so as to energise the main beam filaments 12, the voltage at the cathode of the diode 26 will rise substantially to the power supply voltage. This prevents any significant current flow through the relay coil 20, and hence the contacts 28 open once again. Consequently, the supply of electricity to the dipped beam filaments 13 is terminated and these filaments become extinguished. From the above description, it will be appreciated that the relay will operate only when the alternator or dynamo 25 is producing an output, the sidelights 10 are on and the main beam filaments 12 are off. It may be advantageous for the dipped beam filaments 13 to operate at a reduced intensity when energised via the relay contacts 28 as compared with when they are energised by way of the switches 14, 16 and the switch contacts 17, 18. For this purpose, a ballast resistance 34 shown in broken lines can be incorporated between the contacts 28 and the point 29. In a modification of the above described lighting system, the positions of the resistor 22 and the diode 21 are interchanged so that the relay coil 20 is supplied with electricity via the switch 14 rather than from the alternator or dynamo 25. Although such a modified system will on the whole operate satisfactorily, problems can be encountered with the relay in the event that the voltage drop across the alternator or dynamo 25 rises abnormally slowly when the engine is accelerated. A second embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 2, and is generally similar to the system shown in Figure 1, similar parts being accorded the same reference numerals. In this embodiment, however, the diode 21 and the resistor 22 are omitted and the terminal 20 When the switch 14 is closed to energise the sidelights 10, power is supplied to the relay coil 20 from the power supply. If at this time the switch 23 has not been operated to turn on the ignition circuit, the transistor 35 will not conduct since the point 37 to which its base is connected will be at zero volts. Therefore, the relay coil 20 will not be energised. If the switch 23 is closed but the engine is not started, the voltage at the point 37 will rise slightly but, due to the presence of a diode 38 in the emitter circuit, this will not be sufficient to turn the transistor 35 on. When however the engine is subsequently started, the voltage at the point 37 will rise significantly and base current will flow into the transistor 35 causing the latter to conduct. The relay coil 20 will thus be energised, thereby closing the contacts 28 and energising the dipped beam filaments 13 by way of the fuse 32 and the contacts 28. It will thus be manifest that, when the ignition circuit is turned on and the engine is running, it will not be possible to turn on the sidelights 10 without also causing the dipped beam filaments 13 to come on. However, when the engine is not running the sidelights 10 can be turned on without the filaments 13, e.g. for parking purposes at night. If it is desired to operate the dipped beam filaments 13 in a conventional manner, the switch 16 is closed and the contact 17 is moved into engagement with the fixed contact 19 this assumes of course that the switch 14 will still be closed . The relay contacts 28 will thus be by passed by the switches 14, 16 and the contacts 17, 19. As in the embodiment of Figure 1, a ballast resistance 34 may be provided so that the dipped beam filaments 13 are operated at a reduced intensity when they are energised by way of the relay contacts 28. When the main beam filaments 12 are to be operated, the contact 17 is engaged with the fixed contact 19 with the switches 14 and 16 once again being closed. This causes the voltage at the point 27 to rise substantially to the level of the power supply, so that the relay coil 20 becomes de energised. Hence, the contacts 28 open and the dipped beam filaments 13 are turned off. The diode 38 in the emitter circuit of the transistor 35 prevents a reverse voltage from occurring across the base emitter junction of the transistor if the main beam filaments 12 are energised and the alternator or dynamo 25 is not charging. In the embodiment of Figure 2, the relay circuit has been described as being associated with the alternator or dynamo of a vehicle. In all of the embodiments described above, a series resistor 34 is employed to achieve dimming of the dipped beam filaments 13 when they are energised via the relay as compared with when they are energised via the switch 16 and the switch contacts 17, 18. This is quite satisfactory when only a limited reduction in intensity is required, but for greater intensity reductions the resistor 34 will have to dissipate relatively large amounts of power and therefore becomes more expensive to provide. To overcome this particular problem, a system as shown in Figure 3 may be used instead. In this system, the dipped beam filaments are powered by a pulsed electrical supply and their intensity is controlled by suitably varying the ratio between the ON and OFF periods. More particularly, the system illustrated in Figure 3 comprises generally an oscillator circuit 40 which controls a power switching circuit 41 supplying power to the dipped beam filaments 13, and a control circuit 42 to protect the system in the event that the filaments 13 become short circuited. The oscillator circuit 40 is supplied from a point between the warning lamp 24 and the alternator 25 by way of a resistor 43, a zener diode 44 and a capacitor 45 which together form a stabilised power supply. When the engine is not running, the output voltage produced by this power supply will be very low and the oscillator circuit 40 will not function. If the engine is running but the sidelights 10 are not switched on, then a diode 46 connected between the sidelights and the resistor 43 will clamp the output voltage of the power supply to a level e.g. 1 volt which is still insufficient to cause the oscillator circuit 40 to operate. However, if the sidelights 10 are now switched on, the output voltage of the power supply will rise to a relatively large value e.g. 10 volts . A diode 47 is connected between the negative side of the oscillator circuit 40 and the main beam filaments 12 if these filaments are not energised, then the oscillator circuit will be connected to battery negative via the diode 47 and the filaments 12, and hence the oscillator circuit will function. If however the main beam filaments 12 are turned on, then the diode 47 will be reverse biassed and the oscillator circuit 40 will cease to operate. Thus, the oscillator circuit is operational only when the engine is running, the sidelights 10 are switched on and the main beam filaments 12 are turned off. The oscillator circuit 40 is composed of an integrated timer circuit 48 which is connected for astable operation in the illustrated arrangement, the timer circuit is of the well known 555 type and therefore the pin connections thereof will not be described in detail since these will readily be appreciated by a person skilled in the art. Suffice it to say that pin 3 forms an output terminal of the oscillator circuit. When the voltage at this terminal is at a high level, a capacitor 49 charges by way of a variable resistor 50 and a diode 51 until the voltage across it reaches a predetermined value in this case, two thirds of the supply voltage . At this point, the voltage at the output terminal drops to a low level and the capacitor 49 discharges via a resistor 52 into pin 7 of the timer circuit 48. When the voltage across the capacitor 49 drops to another predetermined value e.g. one third of the supply voltage , the voltage at the output terminal rises to its high level once again and the cycle then repeats. The voltage produced at the output terminal of the oscillator circuit 40 thus consists of a series of pulses whose width can be controlled by adjusting the variable resistor 50. As will become apparent from the ensuing description, there is a danger that the dipped beam filaments 13 will not be switched on properly if the mark space ratio of these voltage pulses is small. In order to anticipate this eventuality, the initial voltage pulse is made much wider by means of a resistor 53, a capacitor 54 and a diode 55. More particularly, as soon as the supply voltage for the oscillator circuit starts to rise as aforesaid when the engine is running and the sidelights are switched on, the capacitor 54 will start to charge at a rate determined by the time constant of the capacitor 54 and the resistor 53. This time constant is made much longer than that of the variable resistor 50 and the capacitor 49, which may be for example 300 ms as compared with 10 ms for the last mentioned components, depending upon the illumination intensity required for the dipped beam filaments 13. The power switching circuit 41 includes a transistor 56 whose base is connected to the output terminal of the oscillator circuit 40 by way of a resistor 57. The collector of the transistor 56 is connected by way of a resistor 58 to a Darlington transistor 59, the latter having its emitter connected to a point 60 between the warning lamp 24 and the ignition switch 23. The collector of transistor 59 is connected by way of resistors 61 and 62 to the dipped beam filaments 13 of the headlamps 11, the connection point between the resistors 61 and 62 being coupled to the emitter of a transistor 63 via a resistor 64 and a diode 65. The base of the transistor 63 is connected to the collector of the transistor 56 by way of a resistor 66, while the collector of the transistor 63 is connected to the base of a transistor 67. This last mentioned transistor has its emitter connected to a connection point between a zener diode 68 and a resistor 69, these latter components being connected in series with the main beam filaments 12. The collector of the transistor 67 is connected via a resistor 70 to the base of a further Darlington transistor 71. The collector emitter path of the Darlington transistor 71 is connected directly between the ignition switch 23 and the dipped beam filaments 13. When a voltage pulse appears at the output terminal of the oscillator circuit 40, the transistor 56 is turned on and allows base current to flow out of the Darlington transistor 59. Collector current will then flow from the transistor 59 to the dipped beam filaments 13 via the resistors 61 and 62. Initially, the filaments 13 are cold and have a very low resistance, typically 0.25 ohms. If the resistors 61 and 62 were not provided then the inrush current to the cold filaments would be much higher than the rated current of the Darlington transistor 59 being for example as much as 50 amps . The resistors 61 and 62 serve to limit this initial current to a safe value, e.g. 6 amps. While the dipped beam filaments 13 are still cold, the voltage at the connection point between the resistors 61 and 62 is at such a value that current can flow through the base emitter junction of the transistor 63 by way of the resistor 64, the diode 65 and the resistor 66, but not through the emitter collector path of the transistor 63. However, as the dipped beam filaments heat up, their resistance increases thereby causing the voltage at the connection point between the resistors 61 and 62 to rise. When this voltage has risen sufficiently, current will flow via the resistor 64, the diode 65 and the emitter collector path of the transistor 63 into the base of the transistor 67, thereby turning the latter on. Earlier conduction of the transistor 67 is also prevented by the magnitude of the voltage generated at the junction between the zener diode 68 and the resistor 69 to which the emitter of the transistor 67 is connected. Since the transistor 67 is now conducting, base current can flow out of the Darlington transistor 71, thereby turning the latter on so that the full operational voltage is then developed across the dipped beam filaments 13. When the other Darlington transistor 59 first switches on, inductance in the circuit to the dipped beam filaments 13 will result in the voltage at the connection point between the resistors 61 and 62 momentarily rising to a relatively high value. In order to prevent this transient voltage from switching on the Darlington transistor 71 while the dipped beam filaments 13 are still cold, a capacitor 72 is connected between the anode of the diode 65 and the anode of the diode 47. The capacitor 72 must charge via the Darlington transistor 59 and the resistors 61 and 64 before the transistor 63 will conduct, and the time constant of this discharging operation is made long enough to ensure that the aforementioned transient voltage does not cause premature turning on of the Darlington transistor 71. At the end of the voltage pulse from the oscillator circuit 40, the transistor 56 will switch off, thereby causing the Darlington transistors 59 and 71 to switch off also so that current supply to the dipped beam filaments 13 is suspended until the start of the next voltage pulse. Where the voltage pulses from the oscillator circuit 40 have a small mark space ratio as mentioned previously, then the increased width of the first pulse will ensure that the dipped beam filaments 13 are energised long enough for them to become heated up. If the width of the first pulse were not to be increased in the above described manner, then there is a danger that the filaments 13 would never heat up sufficiently to bring the Darlington transistor 71 into operation. A capacitor 73 is connected between the emitters of the Darlington transistors 59, 71 and the feed to the dipped beam filaments 13 in order to protect the system from external voltage transients. Obviously, it is desirable that the power switching circuit 41 should not operate in the event that the dipped beam filaments 13 become short circuited. However, it is not possible to use the resistance across the dipped beam filaments to determine whether or not a short circuit is present, since the resistance of healthy filaments is practically zero when they are cold anyway. It is for this reason that the circuit 42 is provided. The circuit 42 comprises a capacitor 74 and a resistor 75 connected in series between the output of the previously described stabilised power supply and the collector of the Darlington transistor 71, the resistor 75 being connected in parallel with a series circuit of a resistor 76 and a diode 77. The connection point between the capacitor 74 and the resistor 75 is coupled on the one hand by way of a resistor 78 to the main beam filaments 12 and on the other hand by way of a resistor 79 to the base of a transistor 80. The collector of the transistor 80 is connected to the output of the stabilised voltage supply via a resistor 81, while its emitter is connected to the anode of the diode 47. A further transistor 82 has its base connected to the collector of the transistor 80 and its collector emitter path connected between the diode 47 and a point between the resistor 57 and the transistor 56. Under normal operating conditions, the voltage across the Darlington transistor 71 will switch between a relatively low value e.g. 1.4 volts when on and a relatively high value e.g. 12 volts when off. During the off period the capacitor 74 will charge via the resistor 75 during the on period the capacitor 74 will discharge by way of the resistor 43, the warning lamp 24, the emitter collector path of the Darlington transistor 71, the resistor 76 and the diode 77. The time constant for charging is made significantly larger than that for discharging, and both of these are much longer than the periodic time of the oscillator circuit 40. This results in the voltage waveform across the capacitor 74 lying within a range e.g. between 2 and 4 volts which is sufficient to maintain the transistor 80 in continuous conduction. The collector voltage of the transistor 80 as applied to the base of the transistor 82 is therefore low enough to clamp the latter transistor in a non conductive state. In the event of there being a short circuit across the dipped beam filaments 13, the voltage at the connection point between the resistors 61 and 62 will not rise in the manner described previously, and therefore the Darlington transistor 71 will not be switched on although the other Darlington transistor 59 will pulse as before and feed current into the short circuit by way of the resistors 61 and 62. Under these conditions, the capacitor 74 will charge continuously via the resistor 75 when the capacitor 74 becomes fully charged, it will no longer be able to feed base current into the transistor 80, which will therefore turn off and remove the clamp from the transistor 82. This latter transistor will then conduct and thereby clamp the base of the transistor 56, so that the flow of base current from the Darlington transistor 59 is permanently suspended and the latter remains turned off. Once the short circuit has been removed, the lighting system will remain in a quiescent state until either the ignition switch 23 or the sidelights 10 are turned off. This will cause the output of the stabilised power supply to drop to a low level or zero, whereupon the capacitor 74 will discharge via the resistor 43, the alternator 25, the dipped beam filaments 13, the resistor 76 and the diode 77 in the case where the ignition switch is turned off , or via the diode 46, the sidelights 10, the dipped beam filaments 13, the resistor 76 and the diode 77 in the case where the sidelights are turned off . When the ignition switch or the sidelights are turned on again, the output of the stabilised power supply will return to its normal operational level and the system will resume its normal functioning. The resistor 78 is provided to prevent the capacitor 74 from charging to the point where the transistor 82 is turned on when the main beam filaments are energised, so that the circuit 42 does not sense the cold dipped beam filaments as being short circuited under this condition. This ensures that the oscillator circuit will revert to normal operation and cause pulsing of the dipped beam filaments as soon as the main beam filaments are switched off. Although the inclusion of the resistor 78 allows the capacitor 74 to charge more during normal operation of the system than would be the case if the resistor 78 were omitted, the values of the various circuit components can be chosen to ensure that this does not present any problems. From the above description, it will be appreciated that the circuits 40, 41 and 42 are additional to the usual components of the vehicle lighting system and in no way interfere with these components. The power dissipation within these circuits is very low compared with the use of a series resistor, and hence the system can operate at a much higher efficiency. The lighting system shown in Figure 3 is suitable for both 12 volt and 24 volt operation. Above, there have been described two basic ways of achieving dimming of the dipped beam filaments when these are energised by virtue of the sidelights having been switched on, namely by means of a series resistor on the one hand and a pulsed electrical supply on the other hand. However, it is also possible to achieve such dimming of the dipped beam by using special headlamp bulbs which contain three separate filaments, namely a main beam filament, a normal dipped beam filament which is energised by way of the switches 14, 16 and the switch contacts 17, 18 and a subsidiary dipped beam filament which is energised when the sidelights are switched on and which has a lower intensity than that of the normal dipped beam filaments.
