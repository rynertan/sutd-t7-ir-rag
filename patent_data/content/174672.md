# Method of manufacturing bismuth germanate crystals.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing bismuth germanate Bi₄Ge₃O₁₂ crystals using the Bridgman technique. A high degree of crystal perfection and an acceptable level of inclusions are obtained by changing the stoichiometry of the starting mixture in favour of Bi₂O₃, such that the starting mixture contains between 40.2 and 40.5 mol. of Bi₂O₃ and between 59.8 and 59.5 mol of GeO₂.
