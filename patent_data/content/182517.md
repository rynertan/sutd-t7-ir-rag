## Description
This invention concerns a method of making a mixture containing an L amino acid essentially free of the enantiomeric D amino acid from an enantiomeric mixture of L,D N acylamino acid ester, which can be optically active containing an excess of either the L or the D isomer or a racemic mixture. Many naturally occurring α amino acids can be duplicated synthetically, except that the synthetic products are mixtures of L and D isomers. Some of the synthetic methods give N acyl α amino acid esters or α amido acid esters as intermediate products. One example is the Schmidt reaction, described and referenced in the book, It is an object of the invention to provide a process for producing an L α amino acid free of enantiomeric D α amino acid. It is another object of the invention to provide a process for selectively enzymatically hydrolyzing only the L isomer of a mixture of the L and D isomers of an α N acylamino acid ester of an α amino acid having the formula of a naturally occurring α amino acid whose α carbon atom is chiral. Other objects, as well as aspects, features and advantages, of the invention will become apparent from a study of the specification, including the specific examples and the claims. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of making a relatively easily separable mixture containing the L isomer of an α amino acid having the formula of a naturally occurring α amino acid whose alpha carbon atom is chiral, said mixture containing said L isomer being essentially free of the D isomer, which comprises enzymatically hydrolyzing an L and D mixture of an α amido acid hydrocarbyl ester derivative of said α amino acid in the presence of an acylase catalyst and an esterase catalyst to promote hydrolysis of said amido group and the esterified carboxy group of said L ester, respectively, of said L isomer only, effecting said hydrolysis by said acylase catalyst and by said esterase catalyst, and recovering said L α amino isomer in admixture with said D α amido acid ester derivative containing essentially no enantiomer of said L α amino acid, wherein said hydrocarbyl is a C₁ to C₆ alkyl group or a benzyl group and the group attached to the carbonyl group of said amido group is a C₁ to C₆ alkyl group, benzyl, H, phenyl, benzyloxy, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl or triphenylmethyl. In the foregoing process the hydrocarbyl ester of the α amido acid has the formula There are several advantages to the present method of making an L amino acid which is free of the D isomer. First, since the acylase requires the carboxyl group alpha to the amido group in order to catalyze the hydrolysis of the amido group, this automatically prevents hydrolysis thereof at a rate much higher than the ester group and thus prevents a highly basic condition that would cause chemical hydrolysis of both D and L isomers. On the other hand, if the rate of hydrolysis promoted by the esterase is much higher than the acylase, the solution will tend to become acidic, but long before the pH is low enough to catalyze chemical hydrolysis, the pH will be too low for the esterase to catalyze the hydrolysis until the pH is automatically raised by the continuing hydrolysis of the amido group catalyzed by the acylase. Ideally, of course, in a given case, it is preferable to adjust the relative amounts of the acylase and the esterase so that the rate of hydrolysis of the amido group and the ester group are essentially equal. Even in such cases, however, the automatic buffering described above prevents any small imbalance over time from creating an acid or a base condition that would promote the non selective chemical hydrolysis. As a result of the foregoing, although buffers can be employed in the process of the invention, it is unnecessary to do so and in the preferred practice of the invention the hydrolysis is effected in the absence of buffers. This is certainly an advantage since it eliminates a step of separation of the buffer from the products of the present process. Of course, a major advantage of the present invention is that the process results in a mixture containing an L amino acid without D amino acid. Although part of the N acyl α amino acid ester is also in the product mixture, this derivative is easily separable by known means such as crystallization, solvent extraction, chromatographically, etc., because the presence of the two substituent groups makes the solubilities, crystallization properties, and absorption on solid adsorbents so much different that separation is easy. Another advantage of the present process is that the N acyl α amino acid ester, after separation from the amino acid can be racemized by known methods and recycled to the process, thus ultimately resulting in conversion of essentially all of the starting material derivative to the L α amino acid. In the practice of the process of the invention the esterase can be any suitable esterase. The esterase can be carboxyl esterase, α chymotrypsin or any other proteases that have esterase activity. The acylase can be aminoacylases from different origins, carboxyl peptidase or other acylases. The starting material L and D α amido acid ester is usually dissolved in a suitable aqueous solvent, either water or water containing a polar organic solvent including 1 0 50, usually 0 40 volume percent lower alcohol, especially methanol or ethanol or both , or 2 0 40, usually 0 30, volume percent acetone or 0 40, usually 0 30, volume percent acetonitrile. Preferably the lower limit of all of the above systems is for at least 10 volume percent of the organic solvent to be present in the aqueous solution. Obviously, also, a mixture of any of the polar solvents can be used in the aqueous system. The starting material mixture of D and L N acylamino acid ester is usually at a concentration of 0.05 to 0.5 M in the solvent, although higher or lower concentrations can be used. When operating the process as a batch reaction, the enzymes are each usually present in the reaction mixture in the concentration of 100 500 units per liter of reaction mixture, although higher and lower amounts can be used. They are usually immobilized on a support by methods well known in the art, but need not be, except that when an esterase is used that will react with the acylase used, the acylase or the esterase is immobilized on a support to prevent this. Also, it is usually advantageous to immobilize both enzymes on a support, either the same support or a different support for each enzyme. This has the advantage that the liquid reaction product is easily removed from the enzymes by simple filtration, settling, centrifugation, or the like. The supported enzymes in the case of a batch reaction can be washed and used again. When carrying out the hydrolysis by passing the α amido acid ester solution continuously over a packed bed containing the immobilized enzymes, washing of the catalyst bed is not even needed. When carrying out the reaction as a batch reaction the usual time of reaction is 3 50 or 100 hours, although higher or lower reaction times can be used and reaction time is by no means the essence of the invention, nor are any other details of the reaction conditions. When operating continuously in a packed column suitable contact times are from 10 minutes to 4 hours, although, again, lower or higher contact times can be used. The support for the acylase enzyme used in this example was cross linked dextran substituted with diethylamino ethyl groups attached through an oxygen of an OH group. It was obtained in bead form from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo., under the name DEAE Sephadex resin, grade A25. Five grams of this resin was suspended in 50 ml of water. With stirring, 250 ml of 0.1N 200 mg of aminoacylase E.C. 3.5.1.14 powder from Aspergillus species from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. containing about 40 percent acylase protein was dissolved in 83 ml of distilled water and then filtered. The suspension of the treated dextran resin described above was filtered and the filter cake dispersed in the filtrate containing the aminoacylase. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at room temperature and filtered. The filter cake was dispersed in 250 ml of deionized water, stirred 1 hour, then filtered. The filter cake was dispersed in 250 ml of 0.2M sodium acetate and the suspension stirred for 1 hour, filtered and the filter cake washed several times with deionized water. The immobilized acylase 50 units of 5 grams, suspended in 15 ml of water, 1 ml of 10 mM The immobilized α chymotrypsin on CMC esterase was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. The pH of the foregoing reaction mixture was 7.5 no pH adjustment was needed. After 36 hours of the hydrolysis reaction at room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered to remove the solid immobilized enzymes from the suspension, the filter cake was washed two times with 20 ml of 33 percent methanol, 67 percent water solution, the washings and the original filtrate were combined, concentrated to about 15 ml., cooled to 4 C and held at that temperature overnight. Crystalline precipitate formed and was filtered out. These crystals were identified as the N acetyl D phenylalanine methyl ester using a chiral gas chromatograph column Chiralsil Val III from Alltech Associates, Inc., Deerfiled, Ill. operated at 170 C isothermal. The crystals were more than 99 percent pure optical purity . The filtrate was washed three times with 10 ml of ethyl ether, the ether layer separated from the water methanol layer and evaporated to give crystals of N acetylphenylalanine methyl ester 25 L, 75 D using thin layer chromatography and optical rotation measurements . No D phenylalanine was detected in this portion of the product. The aqueous layer was evaporated almost to dryness to give 430 mg of product, about an 87 yield. Thin layer chromatography and optical purity measurements established that over 97 percent of this precipitate was L phenylalanine with the balance being N acetyl phenylalanine methyl ester. No detectable D phenylalanine was present in this fraction of the product. No D phenylalanine was detectable in any fraction of the product of the reaction. Thus the hydrolysis reaction resulted in a mixture containing L phenylalanine and D acetylphenylalanine methyl ester but no D phenylalanine. In a manner similar to Example 1, each of the racemic α N acyl α amino acid esters α amido acid esters shown in the first column of Table I are subjected to the enzymatic hydrolysis to selectively convert only L α amido acid esters by hydrolyzing α amido groups thereof and hydrocarbyl carboxy groups thereof, thus producing a mixture containing the L isomer of the corresponding α amino acid and unchanged D α N acyl amino acid ester and no D α amino acid. In these examples the acylase used is the same as was used in Example 1, immobilized on the same support. The particular esterase employed in each example is indicated in the second column of Table 1. In these examples 6 millimoles of the α amido acid ester is dispersed in 20 ml of a 30 percent methanol 7O percent water solution by volume. In Examples 3, 4, 11, 22 and 34 the pH is adjusted to 7.8 by adding dilute acetic acid thereto. Then in all examples 2 ml of 10 mM Since in Examples 5 and 10 the starting materials have second ester groups, the α amino acid products are, respectively,
