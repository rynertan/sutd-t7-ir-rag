# Cigarette filter, method and apparatus for making same.

## Abstract
A cigarette filter as well as a method and apparatus for making it is disclosed. The cigarette filter is rolled in first and second plug papers 1 and 2 and then in chip paper 3 . The first plug paper 1 is comparatively thin and has a smooth surface, while the second plug paper 2 is comparatively thick and has a plurality of holes or grooves 2a preliminarily punched in its surface. By adequately rolling the filter in the first and second plug paper, a plurality of air channels 2a are defined on the periphery of the filter so that smoke is inhaled by a smoker as if it is enclosed by air. The smoker can enjoy its light taste without jeopardising a sense of smoking. The filter is made by a method comprising forming a continuous filter rod by rolling filter material in the first plug paper, rolling the filter rod in the second plug paper having a plurality of holes preliminarily punched and cutting the rod in a predetermined length so that a plurality of channels reaching the suction end are formed on the second plug paper. The apparatus com prises a principal apparatus for making the filter rod and a punching apparatus D for forming punch holes on the plug paper which is subsequently supplied to the principal apparatus.
