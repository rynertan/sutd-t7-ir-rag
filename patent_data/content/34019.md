# Locking mechanism for the doors of security enclosures.

## Abstract
The door 3 of a security enclosure has a primary lock 4 for locking the boltwork 1,2 . A drill resistant disc 11 is rotat ably mounted between the lock and the exterior of the door, and the wire 12 of a relocker 14 passes over the circumfer ence of the disc. If a drilling attack is made on the lock the disc 11 will be encountered and will be rotated by the drill tip to frustrate penetration of the disc by the drill. Furthermore, if the drill is aimed at the circumferential portion of the disc which guides the wire 12 any success in penetrating the disc will sever or dislodge the wire to allow the relocker 14 to move under the action of a spring 18 into a position in which it pro vides an additional locking action in the boltwork.
