# IMPROVED THRESHOLD DETECTOR

## Abstract
A threshold detector, more especially when embodied in a document scanning device, wherein a varying amplitude video signal is compared with a threshold signal. In accord ance with the invention, the threshold signal is produced by a circuit which comprises a counter 22 synchronized to the scanning to produce a sequence of digital values of each line of scan, a memory device 20 which stores digital values released by the digital values produced during scanning, and a D A converter 26 which produces the required threshold voltage from the digital values released from the memory.
