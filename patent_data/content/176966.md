# BANDPASS FILTER WITH DIELECTRIC RESONATORS

## Abstract
A bandpass filter in which a plurality of dielectric resonators 14₁ 14₅ are arranged in an array is disclosed. Two metallic posts 42, 44 each having a length which is substantially equal to a quarter of the wavelength of the fundamental frequency center frequency of the bandpass filter are arranged one between the dielectric resonator 14₁ located at one end of the array and an input connector 22 and the other between the dielectric resonator 14₅ located at the other end of the array and an output connector 24 . This suppresses propagation of spurious modes, particularly propagation at a twice higher frequency than the fundamen tal frequency.
