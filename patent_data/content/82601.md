# Production of polyalkenyl succinic anhydrides.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing polyalkenyl succinic anhydrides by reacting with continuous agitation a polyalkylene having a number average molecular weight of between 300 and 50,000 with maleic anhydride in a molar ration of between 0.5 1 and 20 1 and at a temperature between 200 and 250 C. The feature of the process is that the maleic anhydride is added incrementally to the polybutene at such a rate that a single, homogeneous phase is maintained in the reactor throughout the duration of the reaction and the addition of maleic anhydride reactant is completed within 75 of the duration required to achieve maximum conversion of the polyalkylene of a given molecular weight. The polyalkylene derivative may for example be a polypropylene, a polybutene, a polyiso butena or a polymer of 4 methyl pentene 1. By carrying out the reaction under these conditions the process results in a reduced amount of resin formed and enables more efficient use of maleic anhydride
