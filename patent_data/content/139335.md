# Infrared receiver having a cooled radiation detector.

## Abstract
An infrared receiver having an infrared radiation detec tor 26 , which is cooled by means of a cold gas engine, the thermal contact between a cooling surface 63 of the cold gas engine and the radiation detector 26 being obtained by an elastic thermally conducting bridge 65 . The cylindrical bridge 65 is constituted by a plurality of windings of a metal strip. Due to the presence of the bridge 65 , good thermal conduction and furthermore compensa tion for differences in thermal expansion coefficients of the materials used are obtained. The infrared receiver is particularly suitable for night vision apparatus.
