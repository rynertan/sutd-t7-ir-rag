## Description
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for quantitatively and or qualitatively assayingan analyte. Solid phase immuno assays offer the most specific and sensitive methods for detecting and measuringan unknown material analyte in a given sample. While the actual use of these methods in the field is quitelimited at present, various versions of solid phase assays have been developed and improvements havebeen proposed such that the earlier fluid phase immuno assays eg gel diffusion, precipitation, agglutination will probably be replaced by a new generation of immuno assays. Solid phase assays may be morecomplicated and require more elaborate and complicated technology but they offer higher sensitivity andare better adapted for quantitative work. The present state of the art and the applicability of solid phaseimmuno assays are extensively reviewed in US Patent Nos 3,654,090 and 4,299,916. Briefly, present methods are capable of measuring an unknown analyte provided it is either an antibodyto a known antigen or an antigen, ie, a material to which a specific antibody can bind. Depending on the nature of the unknown, ie, whether it is an antibody or an antigen, the specificcounterpart receptor is affixed onto a solid surface such as the inner wall of a test tube, a dip stick orbeads. The analyte then binds to its solid phase receptor. The presence of the bound analyte and itsquantity can then be determined by a labelled molecule probe which is either the analyte itself competitive assay or an antibody to the analyte sandwich assay . The label can be radioactive RadioImmuno assay , enzymatic Enzyme immuno assay or fluorescent Fluorescence immuno assay . The solidphase principle facilitates the separation of unbound labelled and unlabelled components of the assaysystem antigens and or antibodies . Whilst sensitivity of solid phase immuno assay can be tailored to the specific case, and specificity canbe easily obtained, assays require certain improvements to make them more reliable, usable and portable.Thus, it would be desirable to It is an object of the invention to provide an assay technique and apparatus which is compact andeffective and which lends itself to careful quality control by the user in a manner which minimizes risk oferror due to false positive or negative results. It is a further object of the invention to provide an assay technique and kit in which the effectiveness ofall of the constituents, and timing of the assay may be verified by the user at will. It is yet another object of the invention to provide an assay kit in which semi quantitative tests may beperformed by visual inspection, thereby avoiding the necessity of expensive optical measuring apparatus.Yet more accurate quantitative readings are possible using optical measurement apparatus. Another feature of the invention allows for a kit in which various reagents are preserved in a dried, orsemi dried state, and need only be re hydrated as needed, just prior to use. The use of such a kit, togetherwith means for insuring reagent quality during the assay, thus provides a very powerful diagnostic tool. According to the present invention there is provided a method for detecting at least one analyte in a single liquid solution suspected of containing more than one analyte, said method comprising the steps of Receptors may naturally be adapted for attachment to the solid support. In certain instances thereceptor and or support may have to be modified for attachment. Such a technique is disclosed, eg, in USP4,299,916 wherein linking groups are used to attach receptors onto the surface of the solid support. Theattachment technique used preferably provides a minimum of background noise and does not interfere withthe activity of the receptor vis a vis the analyte or the probe. To provide binding site amplification on the support, the solid support may be treated with a liquidsolution before the receptors have been bound to add additional binding sites. Such a technique isdisclosed in Fish and Ziff, The solid support may be washed after each step, if desired, the first wash occurring after the supporthas contacted with the sample. The wash solution is preferably 0.5M NaCI. The solution may also contain adetergent, eg, BRIJ 35. Where the probe is labelled, the labelled probe may be a labelled receptor or labelled antibody to theanalyte such that a sandwich is formed. By way of example, the labelled probe may be an antibody againstthe immunoglobulin type of the analyte in assays to detect and measure antibody analytes in the sample. The label itself may be radioactive or enzymatic. Enzymatic labels usable according to the inventionare eg, peroxidase or glucose oxidase, both of which provide a color reaction, although other chromogenicenzyme substrate combinations may quite obviously be used. According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the label is a substance which converts soluble,colorless chromogen into an insoluble dye, which precipitates at the site of the bound label to develop acolor reaction. Alternatively, the label may convert insoluble colorless chromogen into soluble colored dye atthe site of the bound label to allow for observation and measurement. Where the analyte is a nucleic acid, a labelled antibody may be used to detect and measure nucleicacids in the samples. By way of example, the labelled antibody may be anti double stranded DNA antibody. Where the analyte is a nucleic acid it may previously have been chemically modified, in which case thelabelled antibody may be an antibody to the chemical modification. The nucleic acid may, according to oneembodiment, be modified by picryl sulfonate according to a technique disclosed, for example, in Kiefer, immunological Methods , edited by Lefkovitz and Pernis, Academic Press 1979, pp 137 150. According to yet another embodiment a nucleic acid may be utilized as an unlabelled probe as isdisclosed, for example, in International Application PC WO03 01459. The nucleic acid may be chemicallymodified, and be capable of annealing with the bound analyte. A labelled anti probe is then utilized which isan antibody to the chemical modification. The unlabelled probe may be identical to the bound receptor priorto the chemical modification. The unlabelled probe is preferably modified by picryl sulfonate. Wheredesired, the unlabelled probe can be hydrolyzed into smaller pieces of nucleic acid, prior to beingchemically modified. According to the invention, a quality control system is provided for monitoring at least some, if not all ofthe assay components, for proper activity, as well as controlling exposure times and conditions. The quality control system may include The various components of the assay may be monitored for proper activity by binding control materialsto specific areas on the solid support. The control substances may generally be selected from the group ofproteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, lipids, and combinations thereof. Thus, an enzyme which will complex and react with the dye substrate development system may bebound to the support to provide control for the activity of the dye substrate system. Additionally or alternatively, a material corresponding to analyte may be bound to the support to testfor proper probe analyte activity. After exposure and development of the signals provided by the controlareas and the receptor areas, the resulting signal is compared to the signal produced by the bound analytefrom the sample. A comparison defines the presence and or extent of the presence of the bound analyte.This technique also serves as a control with respect to the activity of the probe containing solution since if itis not sufficiently active it will provide an inadequate color reaction. Also, the activity of the label of the labelled probe or labelled anti probe may also be controlled bycontacting the probe with specific areas on the solid support to which is bound a material selected from thegroup consisting of avidin, biotin, an antibody or any receptor with which the probe or anti probe labelcomplexes to provide a measurable signal. The presence of the bound probe or anti probe may be measured semi quantitatively, such as byobservation, or quantitatively with conventional instrumentation. The invention is further directed to a container for use in conjunction with assaying techniques in whichthe various reagents are provided within the container in liquid, dried, or semi dried form. Where necessary,the reagents are reconstituted just prior to use. The container is provided with individual compartments inwhich the various steps of the assay are individually performed. Thus, each of the compartments wouldcontain different reagents corresponding to the different steps of the assay. Thus, according to the present invention there is provided an apparatus according to claim 17. Each of the individual compartments may be provided with an orifice through which liquid may beinjected to reconstitute the reagent. The orifice may be covered with a rubber septum at the bottom of eachof the individual compartments to prevent unnecessary exposure to humidity. The compartments arelikewise each provided with an opening in the top which is covered by a rubber strip having an opening in itwhich is normally closed but which allows for insertion and removal of the support and may be eg,longitudinal, circular, etc. Where it is longitudinal, the opening of the rubber strip parallels the interior wallsof each of the individual compartments. The length of the opening is at least as long as the width of thesolid support to allow for insertion and removal. Each of the individual compartments is filled with reagentsand sealed separately with adhesive tape. The solid support is dipped into the appropriate individual compartments for the required length of time,and pulled out of each individual compartment through the openings topped with the rubber cover striphaving its longitudinal slit therein. The lips of the rubber strip facilitate more complete removal of thereagent from the solid support by a wiping action. The lips are closed enough to provide the desired wipingaction. The invention relates to a method and apparatus capable of quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing ananalyte in a manner which allows for improved quality control. The inventive assay system finds particular application when analyzing for a plurality of analytes from asingle sample, ie, a multi analyte assay. This multiple analysis capability provides the advantage ofanalyzing for more than a single analyte in cases where more than a single analyte is suspected. This is ofparticular interest where attempting to perform a differential diagnosis, and where multiple assays mightnormally be indicated. The invention is particularly valuable in connection with differential diagnosis of infectious diseases. According to the present state of the art. immuno diagnosis of such diseases is possible only after theorganism has been previously isolated, cultured, and identified by microbiological, virological, and orbiochemical means. Existing immunodiagnostic assays detect only group antigens , such that the techniqueis able to specify only the group or strain to which the isolated bacterium belongs. Although suchtests are of importance in epidemiological studies. they are not sufficiently specific for non pathogenicvariance of the same bacterium. The technique of the invention makes it possible to perform a differential assay for a plurality ofanalytes in a sample. For example. although the bacterium Table I lists certain pathogenic bacteria and some of their specific virulence factors which may serve asantigens in the multi analyte differential diagnosis of infectious diseases according to the invention. Table Iis, of course. given by way of illustration only and is intended to be neither conclusive nor limiting Differential detection is also useful with nucleic acid analytes. In this instance, a complementaryreceptor to be affixed to the substrate may be a complementary strand of nucleic acid. Where a single strandednucleic acid is the analyte, it can bind to the receptor without any prior treatment. Where theanalyte is a double stranded nucleic acid, denaturation of the analyte is necessary before exposing theanalyte to the receptors. Table II lists certain instances in which differential detection of nucleic acids may be useful, thusenhancing the value of the technique of the present invention. Table III is a partial list of groups of symptomatically similar diseases in which the detection of antigenand or antibody, can be helpful in differential diagnosis. Of course, the listing is not intended to be limitingor all inclusive The inventive technique also permits the concomitant assay of both antigens and antibodies, on a singlesubstrate from the same sample. Such a technique is useful in the diagnosis of infectious diseases wherean excess of antibody signifies the convalescent stage of the illness, and signifies that chemotherapy is nolonger indicated. The following are examples of antigen antibody systems in which both members may be assayedaccording to the invention. As was noted above, other analytes may be detected by detecting the following resultant receptor analytecouples using the technique of the present invention hormones and their receptors various drugs,chemicals and vitamins, and their receptors neurotransmitters and opiates and their receptors enzymesand their substrates, and toxins and their receptors. For purposes of the invention, the term receptor is used in its broadest sense and merely refers toany substance capable of complexing and or affixing to an analyte in a manner which allows for subsequentuse or treatment of the affixed material, preferably in a manner which facilitates its identification, and orquantification, eg, commonly used receptors include proteins. The system of the invention is useful in analyzing for the presence of virulence factors, eg, exotoxins.adherence factors, hemolysins nucleic acids hormones drugs chemicals vitamins neurotransmitters opiates enzymes toxins etc. It is a preferred aspect of the invention that the assay be performed using a solid support having aplurality of receptors thereon, each of which is capable of binding a different analyte thereto. The solidsupport is insoluble in the solution being analyzed and is preferably sufficiently flexible to provide for easeof manipulation. The support of the invention may assume a variety of configurations and may be round and flat, card like,eg, square or rectangular and flat, tubular, a rod, a stick, cylinder, etc. The support used may obviouslybe any material capable of maintaining its general configuration during use. A preferred configurationaccording to the invention is a support in the form of a sheet which may be circular, but which is mostpreferably rectangular. Such a substrate may be formed of polyvinyl, polystyrene, or high impact polystyrene,although other materials may quite obviously be used. The shape of the support, as well as thematerial of which it is made, may quite obviously vary depending upon the circumstances of use. According to the invention a plurality of receptors, are bound to the solid surface of the support. Thechoice of the number and types of receptors to be used depends on the anticipated analytes. A plurality ofdifferent receptors, each specific to a different analyte will thus be used. The different receptors may be bound to the support in a variety of ways. Immunoglobulins antibodies and many protein antigens, will spontaneously bind to various plastics eg, polystyrenes and polyvinyls, aswell as other polymeric materials, eg, celluloses and nylons as well as to glass fibers. High impact polystyrene can be an especially convenient solid support which allows for good binding of protein antigensand low background activities at later stages of the assay. Additionally, the support may be formed of amaterial which is coated with a layer of another material or polymer such as nitrocellulose for purposes ofincreasing the surface area of the support. Single stranded nucleic acids also bind spontaneously to the materials recited in the previous paragraph.Double stranded nucleic acids do not bind to any significant extent to such surfaces such that whenworking with such materials, two possible approaches are available. According to a first approach, the double stranded nucleic acid is bound by means of a cationicpolymer such as poly L lysine to the support according to a technique disclosed in Fish and Ziff, ArthRheum 24 534, 1981. According to a second technique, the nucleic acid is bound covalently after the support itself has beenactivated. Various techniques are available for activating supports such as cellulosic paper for suchpurposes and such papers are now available commercially from various suppliers such as SCHLEICHERAND SCHUELL, or ORGENICS LTD. One suggested technique for activating celluloses is the use of cyanuric chloride, which had previouslynot been adapted to flat surfaces such as paper and which is found to be most convenient and economical.This same method can be used for smoother surfaces such as celluloid, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrateand agarose films. Polysaccharides are similar to double stranded nucleic acids in their inability to bind spontaneously topolymers. They can, however, be attached to plastics by means of another charged polymer, eg, poly L lysine.or they could be covalently bound to proteins by periodate oxidation, and Schiff s base formation,before attempting to absorb them onto plastics. Again, the cyanuric chloride activation technique may beused to bind polysaccharides, as well, to cellulosic materials. Low molecular weight materials usually cannot be bound directly to a solid support and, therefore, mustfirst be bound to a spacer molecule, eg, a protein, before binding to the solid support. United States Patent4,299,916, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, reviews the various possibilities ofbinding a receptor to a solid phase support. The receptors which are selectively attached at pre arranged locations to the support will, quiteobvviously, vary as a function of the analytes being assayed. Thus, for a given analyte, or group of analytes,the receptor selected will differ. Where the analyte is an antigen, the receptor would be the specificantibody. Where the analyte is an antibody, the receptor will be the corresponding antigen. Once the receptor or plurality of receptors has been bound onto the support, such as by absorptionand or adsorption, particularly when the receptor is a protein, the support may be washed in a dilutedetergent to prevent any further binding of protein. In certain instances, blocking or saturation of thesurface by another protein in solution, unrelated to the bound protein, may be required such as is disclosedin USP 4,299,916. Where the support surface has been chemically activated, inactivation by appropriate chemicals andunder certain conditions may be required. For example, when cyanuric chloride activated cellulose is usedas the support, inactivation with 1M ethanolamine at pH 8.0 is preferred. Depending upon the activity of the receptor, special precautions may be necessary to protect thereceptor during storage prior to use. Additionally, depending upon the receptor, special drying techniquesmay be required. With the receptor adhering onto the support, the analyte containing sample can be applied to thesupport by various techniques, depending upon the quantities available, the source of the sample, and theshape of the solid support. The treated substrate is contacted with the analyte containing liquid for a sufficient time and underappropriate conditions to permit the various analytes to bind to their respective receptors. Depending on thecircumstances, such application may take the form of dipping the substrate into a solution containing theanalytes, swabbing the substrates with the solution, etc. When using a card like support 11 of the type shown in Figure 1, the entire card 11 may be dipped intothe sample, if it is liquid, or the sample itself can be streaked or swabbed across the appropriate spaces onthe solid support. The card is coated with control spots 13 for monitoring the various parameters of theassay and standard spots 15 which provide a standard curve for purposes of comparison with the receptor treatedareas 17. Other analyte receptor pairs may require other conditions. Solid or semi solid samples such asbaceterial cultures, tissues, etc, will require some degree of mechanical and or enzymatic homogenizationbefore applying them to the receptor coated substrate surface. During this stage of the procedure the physiochemical conditions for each analyte receptor pair should be optimized. This means that for antigen antibodyinteractions, for example, an isotonic environment with anabove neutral pH would be ideal. Incorporation of the same detergent used to wash the solid phase afterreceptor binding may actually increase the specificity of the reaction and reduce unwanted backgroundreactivity at later stages. Of course, sufficient time must be allowed for interaction between the analyte and the receptor. Thephysiochemical conditions may be altered such that the contact time may be shortened, if desired, such as,for example, by higher temperature, or inclusion of some polymers in the interaction mixture, eg, 4 polyethylene glycol 6000. Once bound onto the substrate receptors, the support is again washed to remove unwanted excess.The subsequent washing procedure is of utmost importance as is the case with any solid phase immuno assay.This is particularly true of the multi analyte system of the invention. The wash procedure mayinclude a detergent, eg, BRIJ 35T, or another suitable detergent. The wash procedure of the invention may be facilitated by utilizing a squeegy effect which wipes offexcess liquid from the support. The washed, analyte containing support is then developed, to quantitatively and or qualitatively establishthe presence of the analytes. This may be achieved such as by development of a color reaction, aradioactive immunoassay, either competitive or non competitive, a sandwich technique, etc. The identity of the various analytes may be determined simply by observing their locations on thesupport since they will be adhering to receptors 17 which have been positioned at pre determined locationson the support. Thus, the mere positive reaction at a given support location is indicative of the presence ofa suspected analyte. The washed support may be developed in the office, under field conditions, or in the laboratory. The probe which is used to detect the bound analyte is normally a labelled receptor to the analyte inquestion. The probe will specifically attach to the receptor bound analyte and allow detection andquantitation by virtue of a label association therewith. In immunoassays for an antigen, the probe is preferably the same as the solid support bound receptor.In immunoassays for antibodies where the solid support receptor is the antigen, the probe is preferably anantibody against the immunoglobulin type of the analyte antibody, eg, labelled anti human immunoglobulinwould be the probe for human antibodies. The probe antibodies may be labelled by radioactive isotopes or by enzymes by any of a number ofwell known techniques such as are described in United States Patents 3,654,090 and 4,099,916, thedisclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference thereto. For purposes of the present invention, enzymes which form an insolubilized color reaction at the variousprobe locations such as peroxidase, glucose oxidase, or betagalactosidase may be used. Although radioactive labels can alternatively be employed in the present invention this results in somecomplication and slowdown of the detection method. Thus, for purposes of the invention, enzymatictechniques are preferred. In certain cases it is desirable to use an unlabelled probe, and then to detect the probe with a labelledmaterial, eg, antibody to the probe. Such a technique may increase sensitivity at the expense of higherbackground reactions. This technique is also well known in the art, see for example, Hale and Randle,Biochem J 88 137, 1963, and need not be further described at this point. In the case of a double stranded nucleic acid analyte bound to a support, one of three generalapproaches may be used to obtain a probe. Anti double stranded DNA anti dsDNA antibodies are isolated from Systemic Lupus Erythematosuspatients or animals with comparable diseases. Anti single stranded DNA antibodies must first be removedby appropriate absorption techniques. Anti dsDNA which remains can be labelled first and used directly toidentify the analyte materials with which it binds to form a duplex. Alternatively, unlabelled duplex boundanti dsDNA antibodies may be detected subsequently with a labelled anti immunoglobulin antibody whilethe duplex is bound onto the support. The analyte samples are first chemically modified so as to add an immunoreactive group to themwithout substantially damaging their stereo structure. One simple chemical modifier is picryl sulfonate whichintroduces a TNP trinitrophenyl group into the amines of the nucleic acid analyte. The production of anti TNPantibodies is a well known procedure in the art, such as is disclosed in Nowotny, Basic Exercises inImmunochemistry . Springer Verlag, New York, 1969. Another method for introducing an immunoreactivegroup into a nucleic acid is described by Poverenney et al, J Immunol Methods, 16 313, 1979. Labelledantibodies to the nucleic acid modifiers are then used as probes to detect the bound analytes. Nucleic acid molecules, identical to the receptor, may be labelled When using enzyme labels, a color reaction is developed to detect the bound enzyme labelled probe.According to the invention, a preferred technique for developing an enzyme color reaction comprises usinga peroxidase labelled probe, or using any other enzyme which converts a soluble dye into an insoluble dyewhich precipitates at the site of the bound enzyme. According to another alternative, the colorless dye may also be insoluble before conversion to developa color reaction. The use of a dye which is capable of being rendered insoluble is extremely importantaccording to the invention since the location of the dye must conform to the location of the enzyme labelledantibody probe if accurate identification is to be made possible. One known technique for the localization of peroxidase is described by Buckel and Zehelein Gene16 149, 1981 as part of an assay to detect a protein on the surface of bacterial colonies. The methodinvolves touching a flat solid support carrying the enzyme labelled probe to the surface of a gelatin basedgel, containing the substrate and dye system for peroxidase. While this method is applicable to theconditions of a research laboratory, it may not readily lend itself to a kit designed to be used under fieldconditions. Thus, it is yet another aspect of the invention that the system of the invention may include an enzymecolor development substrate system which is designed for improved storage and field use. Hydrogenperoxide, the substrate of the enzyme label, is extremely labile and will undergo spontaneous lysis when inaqueous solution. Therefore, the following substrate systems are provided according to the invention The method for attaching the substrate dye mixture to the solid phase support described above maylend itself to other enzyme labels, making appropriate changes in substrate compositions. An alternative dye generation system is described in Bio Rad Price List J. 1984 p 169 and availablecommercially from that company or other suppliers of chemicals eg Sigma . The system is based on 4 chloro 1 naphtholas the electron donor chromogenic substrate. In its reduced colorless form the materialis soluble in alcohol water mixtures. In the presence of peroxidase and hydrogen perioxide the materialforms a blue black precipitate. Using this technique, a probe which is labelled with peroxidase or glucoseoxidase thereon can be detected by dipping the solid support on which the probe is affixed into a solutioncontaining 4 chloro 1 naphthol and peroxide in the case of a peroxidase labelled probe or glucose andperoxidase in the case of a glucose oxidase labelled probe . 9.22 gr liter monohydrate citric acid, 21.52 gr liter Na Prior to use the paper is dipped into hydrogen peroxide 2 x 10 Potato starch may be replaced by instant gelling starch at higher concentration 1 10 w v of the totalmixture depending on the material . In this case all components should be dry mixed and hydrated justbefore dipping the solid support therein. Mix 1 volume of 3 mg 4 chloro 1 naphthol per ml methanol with 5 volumes of a solution of 0.018 hydrogen peroxide in Tris buffered saline 20 mM Tris HCI, 500 mM NaCl. pH 7.5 . This mixture provides acomplete chromogenic mixture for peroxidase. Filter paper can be impregnated with the mixture as aboveand rehydrated prior to use as noted above. A problem inherent in any immunological assay kit is the fact that it contains many reagents andinvolves many reactions, each of which may go wrong and yield a false negative result. The presentinvention provides an optional system for monitoring some or all of the components of the assay for properactivity. Additionally, the present invention provides for quantitative or semi quantitative analysis of analytepresence using visual observation, or relatively inexpensive optical measurement apparatus. Quantitative analysis of the various analytes is achieved by coating the support with a range of analyteconcentrations for each suspected analyte, and then exposing these control regions of the substrate to thesame conditions as the remaining portions of the substrate subsequent to affixation of the sample analyteonto the support . By comparison of the results over the entire support it is possible to obtain a good semi quantitativereading as to the presence of a particular analyte. This is done by comparing the color of thedeveloped receptor regions with the developed regions of control analyte bound on the card. The controlappears as spots 13 in a pre designated area of the solid support see Figure 1 . Such a determination maybe made by visual or instrument inspection. To facilitate comparison, perforations 19 are provided toestablish a tear line on the card which allows for the designated area to be separated from the rest of thecard, and be independently manipulated by the user. Quality control may be provided by assaying while performing the following tests, each represented bya spot on the solid support The quality control system in an assay for an antibody analyte will include the following tests In both of the above examples, a slight problem exists as to control 1 in each case. The shelf life of thesupport bound enzyme may be shorter than the enzyme in the probe. In that case, when the assay is beingperformed the control enzyme can be tagged with a biotin label which will affix the entire molecule to anavidin molecule, previously bound to the solid support. Thus, as part of the assay procedure the controlenzyme may be affixed to the support, such that shelf storage ceases to be a problem. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat immunoglobulin eg commercially available from Miles, orprepared according to Nakane and Kawasi, J Histochem Cytochem 22 1084, 1974 is diluted 1 100 inphosphate buffered saline pH 7.5 or in 1M sodium bicarbonate pH 9.6. The solution is applied to apolystyrene support surface. After 30 60 minutes at room temperature eg 25 C , the polystyrene is washed in 0.85 NaCI. Thepolystyrene support is then dipped in a 1 w v solution of BSA Bovine Serum Albumin CRG 7. Armour for30 minutes and washed first in 0.85 NaCI, and then in water. Alternatively, a solution of the pure enzymeitself 0.01 0.1 U ml in 0.15M ammonium bicarbonate containing 1 BSA is applied to the polystyrenesurface and allowed to dry. The support bound enzyme is then exposed to the substrate dye system. When the analyte is an antibody, serum obtained from healthy young specimens of the same speciesproducing the antibody analyte is diluted 1 1000 in phosphate buffered saline PBS or 1M sodiumbicarbonate pH 9.6. The solution is applied to a polystyrene support, allowed to incubate for 30 minutes atroom temperature, and washed off with 0.85 NaCI containing 0.1 BRIJ 35T. Alternatively, immunoglobulin, isolated from whole serum can be employed. In this instance a 10microgram ml solution of the immunoglobulin in PBS or 1M sodium bicarbonate is used. For an analyte which is an antigen, the control antigen is attached to the solid support in a mannersimilar to the above. When detecting an identifying nucleic acid sequences, the same type of controls may be employed, ie The multi analyte test described until this point may be used qualitatively. The system will thus providea positive or negative answer as to the existence of a particular antigen, antibody or nucleic acid. However, standard spots can be added to the solid support to obtain quantitative information. The standard spotsare all positioned to one side of a perforated tear line 19 Figure 1 . In the semi quantitative mode, each standard spot has a progressively increasing enzyme concentrationand the standard spots will yield, after full development of the assay, a scale of color densities, eachcorresponding to a different amount and or concentration of analyte. At the end of the procedure, the usercan break or tear the solid support at the perforations see Figure 1 and separate the standard panel fromthe analyte panel. This operation facilitates better comparison of the color density between the analyte andthe standard locations. For more quantitative results, the entire control portion of the solid support may be scanned utilizing asuitable optical densitometer. An exact standard curve can then be constructed and the exact quantities ofanalyte can be more precisely determined. Alternatively, or in addition, additional standard or control spots may be utilized, and will now bedescribed. A different amount of enzyme is attached at each spot directly on the support. After completedevelopment with dye, each spot will demonstrate a different color density. The spots may be correlated bythe manufacturer with different amounts of analyte and this information may be included with the test kit. A different amount of avidin is attached at each spot. The enzyme labelled probe is also tagged withbiotin which will enable it to bind to the avidin on the standard spot. Afterward. the procedure is identical tothat of Procedure 1, based upon a guide provided by the manufacturer. For assay systems where the analyte is an antibody, the standard spots may contain different amountsof an immunoglobulin, derived from the same species, donating the antibody. The labelled probe an anti immunoglobulin will then bind to these spots according to the amount of immunoglobulin attached and willyield different color densities. These densities are once again compared to a standard comparison chartprovided by the manufacturer. Receptor analyte combinations may be employed as in Procedures 2 and 3. provided they do notinterfere with the tested analytes or their receptors. For an enzyme containing polysaccharide in its molecule eg horseradish peroxidase the plasticsurface can be coated with different quantities of a lectin a molecule which binds carbohydrates such asCon A. The use of this approach, however, should be limited only to those cases where the analyte itself isdevoid of carbohydrates. Different concentrations of antibody produced against the enzyme, originating in an animal speciesidentical to the donor of the antibody in the enzyme antibody probe. An enzyme immunoglobulin conjugate prepared according to Nakane and Kawasi J HistochemCytochem 22 1084, 1974 is diluted 1 100, 1 200, 1 400, 1 800, 1 1600 1 3200, in PBS pH 7.4 or in 1Msodium bicarbonate pH 9.6. Each dilution is applied on the plastic support at its predetermined spot.Following a 30 60 minutes incubation at room temperature. the whole plastic sheet is washed in 0.85 NaCI with 0.1 BRIJ 35T. The antibody is labelled with biotinyl groups using commercially available reagents eg from SigmaChemical Co. St Louis, Mo, USA or as described in the professional literature Guedson, Ternyck andAvrameas, J Histochem Cytochem 27 1131, 1979 . It is then conjugated to peroxidase by the method ofNakane and Kawasi, J Histochem 22 1084. Avidin obtained from commercial source eg. Sigma isdissolved to 10 micrograms ml in PBS pH 7.4 or 1M sodium bicarbonate pH 9.6. This solution is seriallydiluted 1 1 to obtain the points of the standard curve. Each dilution is then applied onto the plastic support at its predetermined spot. Following a 30 60 minutes incubation, the plastic is washed as above. Either one of the following two approaches can be employed Basically similar to control procedure for sufficient exposure times and reaction conditions, employingnon cross reactive receptor analyte system see above Example 5 . However, in this case the receptors arereacted with various concentrations eg, 20 ng ml 1000 ng ml of the analyte where the analyte is a proteinantigen. If the analyte is an antibody, whole antiserum dilutions are placed on the solid support. Thedilutions depend on the particular batch of antiserum and must be determined beforehand by testing serial1 2 dilutions from 1 10 up to 1 10000. Concanavallin A obtainable from Sigma, GIBCO, Miles is dissolved to 10 micrograms ml in PBS pH7.4 or 1M sodium bicarbonate pH 9.6. it is then further serially diluted 1 2 in the same buffer. The individualdilutions are placed on the plastic support as described in Example 6. Antiserum against the enzyme, eg horseradish peroxidase, is either obtained commercially or producedin the appropriate animal rabbit, goat, chick by repeated immunizations an injection of 100 microgramsenzyme in 1 ml 0.85 NaCI emulsified with 1.0 ml complete Freund s adjuvant GIBCO or Difco injected isfollowed 3 4 weeks later with 200 500 µg peroxidase emulsified as above in incomplete Freund s adjuvant .The antiserum is applied to the plastic surface as described in procedure 3a above Example 8 . An assay according to the invention may be performed using a variety of apparatus. Since the variousreagents are applied to a card. the assay may be performed in conjunction with apparatus of the typeshown in Figure 2, which includes a compartment 21 having no lid which is divided into severalcompartments 23 by parallel inner walls 25. In one of the outside walls of each compartment, near thebottom of the vessel, an orifice 27, covered with a rubber septum 29, may be provided although this maynot be necessary for all kinds of assays this will depend on the solubility of the reagents . The entire vesselis covered with a flexible rubber sheet 31 having a longitudinal slit 33 in the center of each compartmentwhich parallels the inner walls. The length of the slit should not be shorter than the width of the solidsupport. After the device has been loaded with the proper reagents in each compartment, the entire deviceis sealed with seals 35, such as, eg, with adhesive tapes. Each compartment is preferably sealed separatelyin a manner which allows for independent removal of the seal. Such a device may be used in a manner which allocates each of the compartments to a given stage ofthe assay, such as, eg, incubation, wash, etc. The reagents for each stage are loaded into the corresponding compartment and the compartments arearranged in the order they are used Before use, the seal of each compartment is removed and a solvent is introduced into the compartment.The solid support is then dipped into the fresh solution for the required length of time. When incubation hasbeen completed, the solid support is removed from the incubation mixture through the slit in the rubber cover. The elastic slit wipes the card and removes excess liquid from the solid surface. When used in conjunction with a septum 27 at the bottom of each compartment. solvent may beinjected forcefully into the dry reagents through the orifice. This technique may, in some cases, improvesolubilization of certain reagents. Although the invention has been described with reference to a flat card, it may likewise be adapted toother forms of solid support such as flat sticks or rods. Examples of one such embodiment are shown inFigure 3. In this embodiment rod 37 is provided with control spots 39, receptor spots 41, and standardspots 43 positioned on a separate portion of the rod. Other configurations can easily be imagined.
