# Labelled nucleic acid probes and adducts for their preparation.

## Abstract
A labeled nucleic acid probe comprising a a nucleic acid component, b a nucleic acid binding ligand photochemically linked to the nucleic acid component, and c a label chemi cally linked to the nucleic acid binding ligand. The label can be a specifically bindable ligand such as a hapten or biotin, an enzyme such as a Î² galactosidase or horse radish peroxidase, a fluorescent radical, a phycobiliprotein, a luminescent radi cal, or a radioisotope. The probe can be used in assays of nucleic acids, taking advantage of the ability of the nucleic acid component to hybridize.
