## Description
p Hydroxyphenylmaionic acid derivatives and process for their preparation This invention relates to p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivatives and to a process for their preparation. Recently, derivatives 6f p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid have roused interest, because they can be used for acylating the amino group of a rlactam ring formation of a peptide bond . If such a B lactam ring forms part of a penicillin or cephalosporin, a particularly useful, pharmaceutically active compound will be formed in that way. In other words in synthetic antibiotics the p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivative appears to develop as a highly attractive side chain.The formation of a peptide bond between the amino group of the S lactam ring and the carboxyl function of the desired side chain is possible by various methods.These methods to couple the amino group to the carboxyl function have been derived mainly from the field of peptide chemistry.If a p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid structure see formula I, whereinP1 P H,A OH EMI1.1 EMI1.2 tb I SEP g SEP P SEP and SEP P SEP SEP protective SEP groups tb SEP V SEP A SEP SEP activating SEP group, tb is used as a carboxyl function in the coupling process, it will generally be necessary for one or both of the functional groups the phenolic OH and the second carboxyl group first to be protected by the group P and P , respectively after which still activation with group A of the first carboxyl group is required before it is possible to carry out the coupling reaction with the amino group of the ss lactam ring.Finally, the protective groups will have to be removed to obtain the desired ss lactam product. Thus, British Patent Specification 1 547 351 describes the coupling of various p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivatives to the C 7 amino group of 1 oxadethiacephalosporin. In all cases there is started from the monoester II as acylating agentEMI2.1 wherein either both of the reactive positions have been protected by protective groups P and P see the Examples II 16,25,26 and 27 or one reactive position has been protected P H see the Examples II 7,8,17 and 18 . During the coupling process, first the activated form of II is prepared by generating the acid chloride i n s i t u or, in one case see Example II 7 , the mixed anhydride, after which the coupling with the amino group follows.In the Examples where both of the reactive positions have been protected, the yield is approximately 75 or more. If only one reactive position has been protected, the yield may decrease to about 42 . The British Patent Specification 1 570 582 describes in Example 28 the coupling of p methoxyphenylmalonic acid to the amino group of a cephalosporin, where activation occurs again i n s i t u using a carbodiimide. The yield was about 43 . The same process is also described for p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid in place of p methoxyphenylmalonic acid, but as appears from Example 27 the reaction product is then obtained in a much lower and economically uninteresting yield of 25 . From latterExample it is evident that the approach to carry out the coupling reaction with an unprotected, non activated p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid is less suitable. But also the reaction with a p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivative that has been protected and activated shows disadvantages. The preliminary protection of reactive groups, activation of the carboxyl function followed by removal of the reactive groups usually mean as many reaction steps making the process cumbersome, time absorbing and expensive. It is the object of the present invention to provide p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivatives to which the above mentioned disadvantages do not adhere and which nevertheless give high yields in the coupling reaction with the amino group. As a result, the synthesis of the aforesaid B lactam antibiotics can be effected in a simpler and cheaper way. Thus, the invention relates to p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivatives characterized by the formulaEMI3.1 whereinR is an active ester group derived from N hydroxysuccinimide, N hydroxy phthalimide, p or o nitrophenol, pentachloro or pentafluorophenol, chloroacetonitrile or 1 hydroxybenzotri azol e, andR is a hydrogen atom or a carboxyl protective group derived from p methoxybenzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, benzhydryl alcohol or t butyl alcohol. How the term active ester group has to be interpreted will generally be obvious to those skilled in the art. For the sake of completeness it may be remarked that information on this term is to be found in chapter 3 Active esters in peptide synthesis byM.Bodanszky in The Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis, Biology , Volume 1, edited by E.Gross and J.Meienhofer, Academic Press, New York London 1979. Thus, the present invention starts from a p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivative, wherein 1 the phenolic hydroxyl group is unprotected, 2 R is a representative of the active ester groups conventional in peptide chemistry R preferably being an N succinimidyl group, 3 R is a hydrogen atom or one of the conventional carboxyl protective groups, which group leaves readily during the coupling reaction. Examples of readily leaving carboxyl protective groups are to be found in The Peptides , Volume I Methods of Peptide Synthesis , Academic Press, New York 1965, by E.Schröder and K.Lübke. Preferred is a p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivative according to formula III, wherein R N succinimidyl and R p methoxybenzyl seeFormula IV EMI4.1 or wherein R N succinimidyl and R H see Formula V EMI4.2 No protective groups are present in the compound according to Formula V, so that also no protective groups have to be removed later on.True, a protective group for the carboxyl function is present in the compound according to Formula IV, but this need not to be removed either later on in a separate step, because it can be cleaved in a simple way during the coupling process, e.g. by working up the reaction mixture in an acidic medium.So, in both cases the ss lactam ring need not to be subjected to additional chemical operations for removing protective groups, so that the final product is not contaminated from cleaved protective groups nor from chemicals required in the cleaving process. Thanks to the succinimidyl group the carboxyl function in both derivatives has been sufficiently activated to be able to acylate an amino group. There is a marked difference between the activated malonic acid derivatives according to the invention and those known from the British patent specifications discussed before. The former are isolated products, which as such can be transported, stored and caused to react. The latter are generated i n s i t u , for which purpose an extra operation is required which makes the process as a whole more complex and costly, so less attractive. The invention further relates to a process for preparing p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivatives according to the invention, which process is characterized in that a compound of the formula EMI5.1 wherein R and R are each as defined above, is prepared by a introduction of R R not being H by a conventional method for esterifying p hydroxyphenylacetic acid by means of one of the alcohols mentioned above, b carboxylation of the a C atom of the p hydroxyphenyl acetate obtained under a , c introduction of R by means of a condensation reaction which is known in the art, d followed by treatment with an acid, only in those cases where a derivative with R H is desired. To obtain the preferential compound of formula IV the characteristic reaction steps are e esterification of p hydroxyphenylacetic acid by a conventional method using p methoxybenzyl alcohol to p methoxybenzyl p hydroxyphenyl acetate, f carboxylation of the resulting product at the a C atom, and g causing the product formed under f to condensate with N hydroxysuccinimide under the influence of N,N dicyclohexylcarbo diimide. To obtain the preferential compound V the reaction product obtained under g is further treated with an acid. The following Examples may serve to illustrate the invention. The first examples describe the preparation of a p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivative according to the invention, the last one the coupling of such a derivative with an amino group of a ss lactam ring, which ring forms part of a penicillin. From that last Example it also appears that coupling with an excess of p hydroxyphenylmalonic acid derivative according to the invention, followed by a working up process, using 3 N,N dimethylaminopropylamine, may increase the yield of coupling product considerably. For with the diamine the excess of the derivative in question forms a basic amide, which can be removed by washing with diluted acid.
