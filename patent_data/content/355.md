Any alkyl, alkoxy or alkylthio radical contains preferably two carbon atoms, especially one carbon atom. Halogen means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, especially chlorine. When A is 1,4 cyclohexylidene, this may be cis or trans 1,4 cyclohexylidene. When A is optionally substituted trimethylene, this is preferably either unsubstituted or monosubstituted, conveniently at the middle carbon atom. When R1 and R2 are chosen from hydrogen or alkyl, these are preferably aLkyl. Conveniently A is optionally substituted trimethylene or 1,4 cyclohexylidene. Preferably A is optionally substituted trimethylene. When R3 is or contains a dialkylamino radical, the alkyl groups are preferably the same. WhenR3 is an optionally substituted phenyl or phenylamino radical, the substituents are conveniently identical.Conveniently these radicals are unsubstituted or monosubstituted preferably in the para position. WhenR3 is a heterocycle, conveniently this contains one heteroatom chosen from nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur and optionally a second nitrogen atom, e.g. thienyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, pyridyl or pyrazinyl. Conveniently the heterocycle is bound to X by a ring carbon atom adjacent to a heteroatom. R3 is preferably unsubstituted phenyl. R4 and R5 are conveniently hydrogen. X is conveniently CO . The present invention provides a process for the production of a compound of formula I as defined above, which comprises a acylating a compound of formula II EMI4.1 wherein n, A and R1 to R5 are as defined above, or b condensing a compound of formula IIIEMI4.2 wherein n, R4 and R5 are as defined above, and Y is a leaving group, with a compound of formula IVEMI4.3 wherein A, R1 to R3 and X are as defined above. Process a may be effected in conventional manner for the production of amides or thio amides from amines. For example there may be used, as acylating agent, a compound of formula V Z X R3 V wherein X is as defined above, R 3 has the same signification as R3 but is other than amino, alkyl amino and optionally substituted phenylamino and Z is chlorine or bromine. The reaction may be effected conveniently in a solvent such as pyridine and at temperatures from 0 to 250. Alternatively whenR3 is amino, alkylamino or optionally substituted phenylamino, there may be used a compound of formula VI X R6 wherein X is as defined above and R6 is imino, alkylimino or optionally substituted phenylimino.The reaction may be effected conveniently in a solvent such as dimethylformamide and at temperatures from 5 to 250.

Y is conveniently chlorine, bromine, iodine, tosyloxy or mesyloxy.The reaction may be conveniently effected in acetone or dimethylformamide. Suitable reaction temperatures are from 20 to 1500. The compounds of formula I may be isolated from the reaction mixture and purified in known manner.

The starting material of formula II may be produced from a compound of formula III and a compound of formula VIIEMI6.1 wherein A, R1 and R2 are as defined above, in analogous manner to process b . When the amine of formula VII is unsymmetrical, the conditions should be chosen to avoid the formation of the undesired corresponding compound produced by condensation at the nitrogen atom bearing the R1 substituent. For this purpose the amine may be used in protected form of formula VIIIEMI6.2 wherein R7 is a protecting group, such as benzyl or benzyloxy, which may be removed from the resulting product, e.g. by hydrogenolysis. A starting material of formula IIa EMI7.1 wherein AI isEMI7.2 orEMI7.3 and wherein R8 is C14 alkyl and n, R2, R4 and R5 are as defined above, may alternatively be produced by reducing a compound of formula IXEMI7.4 wherein B is CH CH2 or CH2 CH R8 and n, R2, R4, R5 and R8 are as defined above, e.g.by hydrogenation in the presence of Raney nickel. Any starting material of formula II whereinR1 and or R2 is hydrogen may be converted into a corresponding compound wherein R1 and R2 are both alkyl, or R1 is alkyl and R2 is hydrogen under appropriate selective alkylation conditions, The starting material of formula IV may be produced by acylating an amine of formula VII in analogous manner to process a . If desired, one nitrogen atom of an unsymmetrical amine may be protected to facilitate production of the desired product. A starting material of formula IVaEMI8.1 wherein X, R2 and R3 are as defined above and A I together with R1 and the nitrogen atom to which R1 is bound, form a 4 piperidyl radical, may alternatively be produced by acylating 4 piperidone with a compound of formula V or VI and condensing the resulting compound of formula XEMI8.2 wherein X and R3 are as defined above, with a compound of formula XI R2 NH2 XI wherein R2 is as defined above, under simultaneous reduction, e.g. with hydrogen in presence of a catalyst.
