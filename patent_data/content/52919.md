# CRYSTALLIZED, READILY WATER DISPERSIBLE SUGAR PRODUCT

## Abstract
A crystallized sugar product containing a food ingredient is prepared by concentrating a sugar syrup at a temperature in the range of about 25 F. to about 300 F. to a solids content of about 90 to 98 by weight, the sugar syrup containing no more than about 20 by weight non sucrose solids, admixing the concentrated sugar syrup with a predetermined amount of the food ingredient, subjecting the adrnxture to impact beating within a crystallization zone until a crystallized sugar product made up of aggregates of fondant size sucrose crystals and the food ingredient is formed, the crystallized sugar product having a moisture content of less than 2.5 by weight, and recovering the crystallized sugar product from the crystallization zone. The resulting sugar product is dry, granular, free flowing, non caking, and readily dispersible in water. The resulting sugar product may be either an intermediate food product, such as a gelatin concentrate, or an instant food product, such as an instant chocolate pudding mix, which contains all of the dry food ingredients for the final food product.
