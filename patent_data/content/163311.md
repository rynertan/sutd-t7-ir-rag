# Hot standby communications system.

## Abstract
The hot standby communications system includes switching means 9 interposed between two communication equipments 4, 5 to branch a received input to two different powers. One of the powers which is greater than the other is routed to one of the communications equipments which is to be used as a regular equipment 4 with no regard to whether it has initially been a regular equipment or not. The other or smaller power is routed to the other communications equipment which is to be used as a protection equipment 5 with no regard to whether it has initially been a protection equipment or not. This system has a simple construction and allows a minimum of deterioration to occur in communications quality despite the distribution of a power to a protection equipment which is at the standby.
