## Description
The α naphthyl propionic acids are known from the literature for their biological properties. Owing to the presence of the asymmetric carbon atom bearing the naphthyl moiety, they can exist both as racemic mixtures and in the form of the corresponding Of particular interest for its excellent antiphlogistic acitivity is the It was first described in U.S. Patent 3,904,682 and is internationally known as naproxen. Several methods for its preparation are reported in the art literature, including the patent literature. Typically, these methods contemplate the synthesis of Attempts for avoiding these drawbacks have led to stereospecific synthesis of naproxen and, in general, optically active α naphthyl propionic acids see European laid open applications 81993 and 110671 . To our experience, however, these procedures appear to involve a lot of problems, like the use of Grignard s reagents and the possibility of inversion of configuration. Therefore, in the preparation of optically active a naphthyl propionic acids, there is still the need of valuable and economical resolution methods. The present invention refers to a new process for the optical resolution of substantially racemic mixtures of α naphtyl propionic acids of formula Briefly, said process comprises reacting a substantially racemic mixture of an α naphthyl propionic substrate of formula with a substance of formula R₄ NH₂, said substance being an optically active is formed. The pair of diastereoisomeric amides is then resolved into the corresponding single diastereoisomeric amides by fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, optionally in the presence of a basic catalyst, and the recovered diastereoisomeric amide of the desired optically active α naphthyl propionic acid is finally subjected to acid hydrolysis. The process which is the object of the present invention can be illustrated by the following scheme In the above formulas I to VI and is an optically active β aminoalcohol wherein R₅ stands for ethyl. It will be also apparent for any person skilled in the art that, with reference to the diastereoisomeric amides of formula IV and V, the first letter of each of the pair of symbols As used herein, the terms C₁ ₄ alkyl and C₁ ₆ alkyl designate linear or branched alkyl moieties from 1 to 4 and 1 to 6 carbon atoms respectively such as, for instance, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, tert. butyl, sec. butyl, n pentyl and n hexyl as well as all the positional isomers thereof. The terms C₁ ₈ alkoxy indicates linear or branched alkoxy groups like methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, n butoxy, isobutoxy or tert. butoxy, n pentyloxy, neopentyloxy, or isopentyloxy, n hexyloxy, 4 methyl hexyloxy or 2 ethyl butyloxy, 2 methyl 2 isopropyl propoxy and 2 methyl 2 butyl propoxy. A C₂ ₆ aliphatic acyloxy group essentially designates acetoxy, propionyloxy, butyryloxy, isobutyryloxy, n pentanoyloxy, pivaloyloxy and n hexanoyloxy. The term halogen refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. A preferred starting substrate of formula II is that wherein R₁ is C₁ ₆ alkyl, R₂ is hydrogen or halogen and R₃ is selected from hydroxy, C₁ ₈ alkoxy, C₁ ₈ alkoxy substituted by halogen or phenyl, or both, C₂ ₆ aliphatic acyloxy, benzoyloxy and halogen. A most preferred starting substrate of formula II is that wherein R₁ is C₁ ₆ alkyl, R₂ is hydrogen or halogen and R₃ is selected from C₁ ₈ alkoxy, C₁ ₈ alkoxy substituted by halogen or phenyl, or both, and halogen. According to the above Scheme 1, the first step of the resolution method of the invention is the formation of a pair of diastereoisomeric amides, by reaction of substantially racemic mixture of an α naphthyl propionic substrate of formula wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are as above defined, with a substance of formula R₄ NH₂, said substance being an optically active In the actual practice, a molar proportion of a substantially racemic mixture of a compound of formula II above is reacted with from about 1 to about 10 molar proportions of an optically active Suitable reaction solvents are represented by C₆ ₉ linear or ciclyc hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene, toluene, the xylenes, nitrobenzene and analogs, halogenated C₁ ₄ hydrocarbons, e.g. methylchloride, methylenechloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, bromoform, methylene bromide, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and analogs, tetrahydrofuran, di hydropyran, tetrahydropyran, ethylene or propylene glycol and the corresponding monk or di C₁ ₂ alkyl ethers, lower aliphatic ketones like acetone, methylethylketone, methylisobutylketone and analogs, ethylacetate, butylacetate and analogs, or mixtures thereof. Preferred solvent are the halogenated C₁ ₄ hydrocarbons and the aromatic hydrocarbons. The temperature at which the amidation reaction as per step A of the above Scheme is carried out is not critical. As stated above, it may vary within about the room temperature and the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture. It was observed that, when an α naphthyl propionic acid halide is used as the starting substrate, the amidation reaction runs satisfactorily at about room temperature, whereas more drastic temperature conditions are required when, in the starting compound of formula II, R₃ represents a C₁ ₈ alkoxy radical, optionally substituted by halogen or phenyl or both. Said drastic conditions, however, can be avoided if the reaction is carried out in the presence of strong alkali agents such as, for instance, ammonium hydroxide, an alkali or earth alkali hydride or amide, or an alkali C₁ ₄ alkoxide. The alkali agent can be added in amounts varying within very wide limits. Preferably, it is added in an amount comprised between about 3 and about 15 molar percent, calculated over the starting substrate of formula II. In this ease, the amidation reaction can advantageously take place at a temperature comprised between about room temperature and about 50 C. If an α naphthyl propionic acid halide of formula II R₃ halogen is selected as the starting substrate, the presence of an organic base may be necessary in order to block the acidity which forms during the reaction course. Said organic base may be the preselected optically active The yields of this step are practically quantitative in any case never lower than 90 . A pair of diastereoisomeric amides of formula wherein R₁, R₂ and R₄ are as above defined, is formed, which depending on whether the selected optically active β aminoalcohol is the This step is performed by dissolving or suspending the selected pair of diastereoisomeric amides of formula IV in a solvent or solvent system, heating these mixtures to a predetermined temperature, and gradually cooling the obtained solution, thus causing the less soluble of the two diastereoisomeric amides to precipitate from the reaction medium. Several solvents or solvent systems can advantageously be employed in this resolution step such as, for instance, the same media used in the above illustrate amidation procedure. Other solvents or solvent systems which have given absolutely satisfactory results are the polar solvents like the lower aliphatic ketones and the N,N di lower alkyl amides of lower aliphatic acids, e.g. acetone, methylethylketone methylisopropylketone, diethylketone, methylisobutylketone, dimethylformamide, diethylformamide dimethylacetamide and analogs, alone or in admixture with water in various volumetric ratios. The choice of the solvent or solvent system is not critical, though it may depend on the nature of the substrate of formula III to be resolved. In general, the solvent, or the solvent system is selected so as to provide the maximum difference in solubility between the single diastereoisomeric amides. To illustrate, the resolution step can be performed by suspending at room temperature the selected pair of diastereoisomeric amides of formula IV, in a solvent or solvent system, which is advantageously selected from an aromatic hydrocarbon like benzene, toluene, the xylenes or nitrobenzene, a lower aliphatic ketone or an N,N di lower alkyl amide of a lower aliphatic acid, alone or in admixture with water, or from ethylene or propylene glycol and the corresponding mono or di C₁ ₂ alkylethers. The reaction mixture is then heated until the solid is almost completely dissolved and the resulting mixture is gradually cooled. In order to favor the fractional crystallization of the desired single diastereoisomeric amide the reaction mixture can be seeded, at a predetermined temperature, with a small amount of crystals of the desired diastereoisomeric amide. The temperature at which the seeding occurs may be dependent on the nature of the solvent or solvent system as an example, when an aromatic hydrocarbon, like toluene, is the employed solvent, seeding may take place at about 85 80 C, whereas, when the solvent system is a lower aliphatic ketone, like acetone or an N,N di lower alkyl amide of a lower aliphatic acid such as, for instance, dimethylformamide, in admixture with water, seeding may occur at about 35 30 C. In general, seeding occurs as soon as the desired precipitate begins to form. The reaction mixture can advantageously be kept at the seeding temperature for a period of time varying from about 1 to about 3 hours, then it is gradually cooled until complete precipitation of the desired single diastereoisomeric amide. Depending on the nature of the employed solvent or solvent system, the final temperature is comprised between about 40 C and about room temperature or less. In general, the resolution is performed in a period of time varying from about 3 to about 6 hours. The diastereoisomeric amide which precipitates is in a practically pure crystalline form. With reference to the above reaction scheme, it can be one of the following four amides, namely A preferred mode of performing the resolution step B comprises first dissolving or suspending the selected pair of diastereoisomeric amides of formula IV The resulting mixture is gradually cooled to a predetermined temperature interval, added with a catalytic amount of a strong alkali agent and kept within said temperature interval for a period of time varying from about 6 to about 30 hours. This temperature interval is not critical and essentially depends on the employed solvent or solvent system. As an illustrative, though not Imitative example, when the solvent is an aromatic hydrocarbon like toluene, the addition of the alkaline agent occurs in the temperature interval comprised between about 75 and about 50 C. Suitable strong alkali agents are selected from ammonium hydroxide, alkali lower alkoxides such as, for instance, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium isopropoxide, potassium tert. butoxide and the like, alkali or earth alkali hydrides, e.g. sodium or potassium hydride or magnesium or calcium hydride, alkali or earth alkali amides like sodium amide, potassium amide, calcium amide and analogs. The amount of alkali catalyst to be added may vary within very wide ranges. Preferred amounts are comprised between about 3 and about 10 molar percent calculated over the pair of diastereoisomeric amides of formula IV to be resolved. They are preferably added under an inert gas atmosphere, e.g. under nitrogen atmosphere. As stated above, after the addition of the catalyst, the reaction mixture is kept within the predetermined temperature interval for a period of time varying from about 6 to about 30 hours, whereby most of the desired single diastereoisomeric amide crystallizes out from the medium. A further gradual cooling complete the crystallization of the desired end product, which is recovered by filtration. The final temperature is advantageously selected from about 45 C to about room temperature or less. It has also been found that, in order to favor the fractional precipitation of the desired single diastereoisomeric amide, the reaction solution can be seeded with a small amount of crystals of the same amide. For the purposes of the present invention, seeding can take place before or after the addition of the alkaline catalyst. The single diastereoisomeric amides The yield of single diastereoisomeric amide achieved by this procedure are exceptionally high. In fact, they are never lower than 70 , but calculated over the starting pair of diastereoisomeric amides, not over the single diastereoisomeric amide contained in the pair. In other words, one molar amount of a pair of diastereoisomeric amides That amides of substantially racemic mixtures of α naphthyl propionic acids with optically active In Japanese Publication pre examination N 56 095149, an attempt is described for resolving the In addition to these considerations, it must also be pointed out that when the resolution process of the present invention is performed in the presence of a strong alkali agents, it is possible to obtain the final precursors of the desired optically active α naphthyl propionic acids of formula with yields which are absolutely higher than those obtained with the classical resollution methods known from the art literature. In fact, in none of these procedures, all based on the formation of pairs of diastereoisomeric salts with optically active organic bases, the desired single diastereoisomeric salt is obtained with a yield higher than 50 , when calculated over the pair of salts which must be resolved. As stated above, step B , namely the resolution, can advantageously be carried out without isolating the pair of diastereoisomeric amides of formula IV prepared according to step A . With this respect, the exceptionally good yields of the desired single diastereoisomeric amide are also achieved when the racemic substrate of formula II and the optically active Considering also that the yields of the subsequent hydrolytic step C are always higher than 90 , it derives that the present invention provides a new and useful method for the preparation of optically active α naphthyl propionic acids. The amides of formula IV, both as pair of diastereoisomeric compounds or in the form of the single diastereoisomers of formula V are new and, accordingly, they represent a further object of the invention. To obtain the final compounds of formula VI the selected single diastereoisomeric amide of formula V obtained as under step B is subjected to acidic hydrolysis, as an example, by means of concentrated or diluted mineral acids, and, if necessary, to a further purification procedure in order to obtain the desired end product with the maximum purity degree. Said purification, however, has absolutely no influence on the yields of this step. When a compound of formula VI is obtained, in which R₂ is halogen, mercapto, C₁ ₆ alkylthio, phenylthio, benzylthio, C₁ ₆ alkylsulfonyl, benzenesulfonyl, benzenesulfonyl substituted by halogen or C₁ ₄ alkyl, it is possible to catalytically remove these groups so as to restore the hydrogen atom. For instance, this can be achieved by means of the hydrogenation procedure described in U.S. Patent 4,423,244. It has also been found that, when the removal of said groups is carried out on a pair of diastereoisomeric amides of formula IV, a concomitant fractional crystallization may occur, so that the end product may be one of the single diastereoisomeric amides present in the starting pair, in which R₂ is hydrogen. Other obvious methods for replacing the above said groups with a hydrogen atom will be apparent to the art skilled technician. Anyway, these groups can be removed at whatsoever moment of the above illustrated reactions sequence without any prejudice for the reactions themselves and the global results of the process.
