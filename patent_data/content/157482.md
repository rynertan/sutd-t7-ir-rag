## Description
This invention relates to a surface acoustic wave device and it relates especially to such a device suitable for subjecting a surface acoustic wave SAW to a number of different delays. A surface acoustic wave device typically comprises a substrate of a piezoelectric material, e.g. quartz lead zirconate ceramic PZT or lithium niobate LiNbO₃ , which is provided, at one of its major surfaces, with an input transducer for launching a SAW along a suitable cystallographic direction and an output transducer for receiving the wave, after a delay due to the propagation time. Usually, the input and output transducers are in the form of interdigital arrays of strip electrodes applied to the substrate by a suitable photolithographic technique. The value of a device of this and lies in the fact that the velocity of a SAW propagating at the surface of a piezoelectric substrate is much smaller than that of an electromagnetic wave used to excite the input transducer thus relatively large delays can be achieved. It may be desirable in practice to subject a SAW to different delays and to this end a plurality of output transducers is arranged on the substrate, individual transducers being spaced apart along the propogation direction. A device of this kind is shown, by way of example, in Figure 1 the input transducer is represented at T A wave launched by the input transducer is received at the output transducers T₀₁, T₀₂ .... T₀₆ after respective delays t A wave may suffer a partial reflection at an output transducer and, in these circumstances, transducer T₀₁, for example, may receive a wave after a delay t In some signal processing applications it is desirable to arrange that a surface acoustic wave device be capable of rejecting a wave which has been subjected to a specific undesirable delay. Hitherto, it has been customary to omit one of the output transducers. As shown in Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings, an output transducer which would otherwise occupy a position referenced at T In practice, however, a signal delayed by t It is an object of the present invention to provide a surface accoustic wave device wherein the above mentioned problem is substantially alleviated. Accordingly there is provided a surface acoustic wave device wherein a substrate 10 of a piezoelectric material is provided with input transducer means T In a preferred embodiment the first and different tracks are on the same side of said input transducer means. In order that the invention may be carried into effect an embodiment thereof is now described, by way of example only, by reference to Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings which shows a perspective view of a surface acoustic wave device. Referring now to Figure 3, a substrate 10 is provided, at a major surface, with an input transducer arrangement T In this example the output transducers T ₀₁ , T ₀₂ ... T₀ ₁₀ are arranged at regular intervals along the propagation direction, except for an interruption at the position referenced T Moreover, the output transducers are arranged on the substrate on two distinct tracks, in side by side relationship. As will be apparent from the drawing, the relative spacings of the transducers in each track is such that it is not possible to construct a path length, from the input transducer to any one of the output transducers, corresponding to the delay t It will be appreciated that the output transducers need not necessarily be arranged along parallel tracks, in side by side relationship, as shown in Figure 3. In an alternative embodiment the input transducer may be positioned centrally on the substrate, the output transducers being arranged in their respective tracks 20, 30 on opposite sides of the input transducer, but with the same relative spacings.
