# Vascular prosthesis and method of producing it.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a vascular prosthesis in the form of a flexible tube which can be implanted in animals or human beings, with a regular pattern of blind holes in the external surface of the tube, which are regular with regard to direction, transverse dimensions and depth and are pro duced by laser treatment. The invention also relates to a method of producing such a vascular prosthesis consisting in that the holes are produced by means of pulsated laser beams along one or more helical lines, the tube being rotated and displaced axially at the same time.
