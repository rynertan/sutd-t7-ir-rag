# Vertical stacking terminal for containers.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a vertical stacking terminal for containers, comprising at least one corridor 1 having at both sides thereof a plurality of storage or stacking compart ments 2 in a multiple tier arrangement and designed to receive the containers C . Robot transfer carriages 4 are provided in said corridor 1 and are movable along the corridor on horizontal runways 5 located at each tier or level of storage compartments 2 . These robot transfer carriages are intended to move the containers C horizontal ly along the corridor and to introduce them into and retrieve them from the storage compartments 2 . At least at one end of the corridor 1 there is provided a lifting unit 3 for moving the incoming and outgoing containers C vertically. According to the invention, the lifting unit 3 is provided with its own container holding means 37 whereby a container C is received from or is delivered to the robet transfer carriage 4 operating at a given tier, while at ground level suitable introduction and retrieval transfer means 6, 6 are provided to receive an incoming container from a loading or introduction area 8 and deliver it to the container holding means 37 of the lifting unit 3 , and to receive an outgoing container from the container holding means 37 of the lifting unit 3 and transfer it to an unloading or retrieval area 8 . Thus, the three basic handlings of a container, namely ensilage or de ensilage, lifting up or hauling down, and ingress or egress, are separated from each other and are effected by different means, respectively robot carriages, lifting unit with its own container holding means, and introduction and retrieval transfer means at ground level , in different and independent time periods which do not add to each other.
