## Description
This invention relates to resin modified polyurea ioms and methods for their manufacture. It has been proposed to manufacture foamed plastics materials having a polyurea structure by reacting organic polyisocyanates with water in the presence of catalysts for the reaction and optionally other additives such as surface active agents. Thus, in our NetherlandsPatent Application No. 76 06827 there has becn proposed a method for the ,anufacture of polyurea foams characterised in that an organic polyisocyanate is reacted with at least a chemically equivalent amount of water in the presence of an imidazole compounds Such foams have many excellent properties but their fire resistance is not always sufficiently high to meet the increasingly stringent standard which are demanded. It has also been proposed to maize foamed plastics materials by polymerising phenolic resin or amino resins under foam forming conditions but the processes enployed generally rake use of catalysts of a strongly acidic nature which can have a corrosive effect on the machinery involved. It has now been found that foams which are attractive from both technical and economic viewpoints can be made by incorporating a phenolic or amino rcsin into a polyurea foam formulation. Thus, according to the present. invention, there is provided a process for the manufacture of polyurea foams by reacting an organic polyisocyanate with at least a chemically equivalent amount of water in the presence of a catalyst for the reaction characterised in that the reaction is performed in the presence of an amino or phenolic resin and in the absence of acid. Organic polyisocyanates which may be used in the process of the invention include particularly those aromatic polyisocyanates that have already becn described for use in the manufacture of polymeric foams such as polyurethane, polyurea or polyisocyanurate foams.Particular ncntion may be made of diphenylmethane diisocyanate and tolylene diisocyanate in their various ferns. It is preferred to usr a polyisocyanate component comprising diphenylmethane diisocyanate, especially diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate which may be in adciyture with isomeric or other related polyisocyanates or ray have been modified in known manner to introduce a significant isocyanurate, carbodiimide, uretonimine or biuret content. Polyisocyanate components comprising diphenylmethane diisocyanate include the cude diphenylmethane diisocyanates that have been fully described in the pric art.Particularly useful crude diphenylmethane diisocyanate compositions contain fron 30 to 95 , especially from 40 to 80 , by weight of diphenylmethane diisocyanates, the remainder beeing largely polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates of functionality greater than two. Diphenylmethane diisocyanate, in one or other of its forms, may also be used in admixture with tolylene diisocyanate. Wne water used in the process of the invention must be in an amount that is at least chemically equivalent to the isocyanate groups present in the organic polyisocyanate on the basis of two isocyanate groups reacting with one molecule of water. Useful results can be obtained by using up to 10 times the amount of water that is equivalent to the polyisocyanate but it is preferred to use from 1.5 to 5 and especially from 2 to 4 times the chemically equivalent amount. The amount of excess water provides a means of controlling opening of the cells of the foam and can be used to avoid shrinkage and scorch in large sections. Catalysts for the reaction between the polyisocyanate and water have been described in the literature relating to the reaction of organic isocyanates. Particular invention nay be made of tertiary amines, especially watersoluble tertiary amines. Especially suitable catalysts include imidazole compounds, especially those of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R7, R2, H and R4 each independently represents hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl, especially lower alkyl.Examples of such compounds include imidazole, 1 methylimidazole, 2 methylimidazole, 4 methylimidazole, 1, 2 dimethylimidazole, 2,4 dimethylimidazole, 1,2,4 trimethylimidazole, 1,2,5 trimethylimidazole, 2,4,5 trimethylimidazole and 1 ,2,4,5 tetramethyl imidazole. Imidazole compounds that have been found to be particularly useful in the process of the invention include imidazole, 1 methylimidazole, 2 methylimidazole and 1,2dimethylimidazole and mixtures of two or more of these compounds.The irnidazole compound or other tertiary amine is used in a catalytically effective amount, for example from 0.5 to 10 , especially 1.5 to 8 , by weight based on the weight of organic polyisocyanate. The most suitable amount to use in any particular case depends on the compound being used and on the other components of the formulation and can easily be found by trial. Many of the imidazole compounds are sufficiently soluble in water to be used in the form of a solution in the water that is reacted with the polyisocyanate. The occurrence of crystallisation from the aqueous solution at low temperatures can often be avoided by using mixtures of imidazole compounds. The alkalinity of the aqueous solutions can cause corrosion of equipment containing aluminium or zinc but this can be reduced by saturating the catalyst solution with carbon dioxide or partially neutralising it with boric acid. Imidazole compounds having lower aqueous solubility may be dissolved in another component, for example the polyisocyanate or a tris halogenalkyl phosphate. The imidazole compounds give exceptional stability to the foams during formation and in this respect they are superior to other catalysts. Thus, the problems of foam collapse and excessive shrinkage which can occur in the preparatiot of foams using some catalysts are largely overcome by fuzing the imidazole compounds. Furthermore, the imidazole compounds are more tolerant to the presence or absence of other conventional foam additives. The amino and phenolic resins used in the process of the invention are known materials that have been fully described in the prior art as have methods for their preparation. The amino resins are resinous condensation products of amino type compounds such as urea, thiourea, ethyleneurea, melamine, substituted melamines, guanamine, benzoguanamine or dicyandiamide with aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propional dehyde, butyral dehyde benzal dehyde or furfural dehyde. The preferred resins are the condensation products of urea or melamine with formaldehyde. The properties of the resins may be varied in known manner by appropriate adjustment of the type and ratio of components and the reaction conditions of catalyst, time and temperature. The phenolic resins are resinous condensation products of phenols such as phenol, cresols, xJlenols or resorcinol with formaldehyde or, less usually, other aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, benzaldehyde, furfuraldehyde or hexamethylene tetramine.The condensation of the phenol with the aldehyde may be carried out in known manner under acid or alkaline conditions and the properties of the product will vary accordingly. Generally, the phenol and the ddehyde are reacted in a ratio of from 1 to 3 mols of aldehyde per mol of phenol. The amounts of amino or piFenolic resins used in the process of the invention may vary over a fde range.Suitable foamed products are obtained when the amino or phenolic resin constitutes from 5 to 70 and preferably from 20 to 40 of the weight of the final foam. The amino or phenolic resin may be mixed with the other components of the fodm Formulation .n any suitable manner. In some cases it may be convenient to pre mix the resin with one of the organic components of the formulation but it is usually preferred to use the resin in the form of an aqueous syrup and to mix it with the water used in the foaming process. In this case, the water present in the aqueous syrup must be taken into account in any consideration of the stoichiometry of the system. Incorporating the resin with the aqueous component of the reaction mixture is useful in that it increases the volume of the aqueous component which otherwise is very small in relation to the polyisocyanate component.It is also advantageous in producing a blend of a viscosity suitable for metering by gear pumps and similar equipment, which are subject to stoppage when used with low viscosity components. In general, urea formaldehyde and melamineformaldehyde resins are preferred because they are more compatible with water than are the phenol formaldehyde resins and hence may be blended more easily with the aqueous component. It is often convenient to dissolve phenolformaldehyde resins in plasticiser type additives such as tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate. This solution may be used as a separate component of the reaction mixture or it may be emulsified into the aqueous component using a surfactant. The foams made by the process of the invention are substantially rigid, have predominantly open cells and are of very low flammability. A tendency to brittleness can be reduced by including a plasticiser in the foam formulation, especially a tris halogenoalkyl phosphate such as tris 2chloroethyl phosphate, tris chloropropyl phosphate or tris 2,3 dibromopropyl phosphate. In addition to having a useful plasticising effect, these compounds bring about a further improvement in the fire resistance of the foams.Particularly useful amounts of tris halogenoalkl phosphate are in the range of from 10 to 2X3s and especially from 25 to 75 by weight based on the weight of polyisocyanate. In addition to the ingredients already mentioned, there may be included in the foam forming reaction mixture other additives of the types conventionally employed in the production of polymeric foams from organic polyisocyanates.Thus, the reaction mixture may optionally contain surface active agents or foam stabilisers, for example siloxane oxyalkylene copolymers, anionic surface active agents and non ionic surface active agents such as ethylene oxide propylene oxide block copolymers. The surface active agent may be used in amounts of from 0.01 to 10 by weight based on the weight of polyisocyanate but is especially effective in amounts of from 0. to 5 . The stability of the foam forming systen may be still further improved by including a minor amount of an organic polyol in the foam formulation, keeping the water in an amount that is at least chemically equivalent to the polisocyanate. Suitable organic polyols include non polymeric polyols, fr example ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol 1,4 butane diol, glycerol, hexanetriol and sorbitol. 0they suitable polyols include polymeric polyols which are useful in reducing the friability of the foams.Such polyols usually have from 2 to,8 hydroxyl groups per molcul and include, in particular, polyether and polyester polyols. These have been widely described in the prior art, for example in Polyurethanes, Chemistry and Technology by J.H. Saunders cild K.C. Frisch Interscience Publishers , especially at pages 32 Il8 of Part I. Useful polyether polyols include polyoxypropylene polyols and ethylene oxide tipped polyoxgrpropylene polyols. Useful polyester polyols include the reaction products of dihydric alcohols with dicarboxylic acids, optionally with the inclusion of higher functionality reactants.The polymeric polyols may also be used in a for whcre they have been modified in known manner by polymerisiring one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers, for example acrylonitrile, styrene or methyl metilacrylate therein. Particularly suitable polymeric polyols have hydroxyl numbers of less than 600, preferably in the range 30 200. The amount of organic polyol used should preferably not exceed 30 of the polyisocyanate on a chemical equivalents basis. The polyol may be included in a formulation by pre reacting it with the polyisocyanate to give a prepolymer or by mixing it together with the water and the aldehyde resin syrup and using as a one shot system. Other additives which may be incorporated in the reaction mixture include dyes, pigments, fillers, inorganic flame retardants such as ammonium phosphate, ammonium polyphosphate, and ammonium bromide and urea. Particularly useful reaction mixtures consist essentially of a crude diphenylmethane diisocyanate composition containing from 40 to 80 by weight of diphenylmethane diisocyanate, fro 1.5 to 5 times the chemically equivalent amount of water, from 0.5 to 4 by weight of an inidazole compound, from 10 to 30 by weight of. an organic flame retardant such as tris chlorcethyl phosphate or tris chloropropy . phosphate, from 5 to 50 by weight of an amino or phenolic resin and from 0.1 to 1.0 by weight of a surface active agent and optionally other conventional foam forming ingredients of an inert nature, the weight percentages being based on the weight of the total composition. The foam forming ingredients used in the process of the invention r..y be mixed together continuously or discontinuously using any of the methods and equipment that have been described for the preparation of polymeric foams from organic polyisocyanates. The starting materials may be at normal or slightly elevated temperatures, for example 500C. The foams made in accordance with the preset invention are economically more attractive than polywrea foams made by prior methods. In addition to the economic benefit, the presence of the amino or phenolic resin has the useful effect of absorbing some of the heat of reaction and so reducing the temperature rise during foaming, and produces improved fire resistance with reduced smoke evolution. Compared with prior art foams made from amino or phenolic resins, the foams of the present invention are easier to make and avoid the use of acidic catalysts with their associated corrosion problems. Furthermore, the foams of the invention are less brittle and may be made less prone to absorb water. The foams obtained according to tht process of the invention may have low or high densities and may be used in packaging, horticultural applications, general purpose insulation, cavity wall insulation, panel filling etc. The usefulness of the foam for any particular ap 7licativil may be influenced by varying the formulation. The foarns may be formed in combination with other materials, for example flexible or rigid facing materials, using known methods, for example continuous lamination techniques. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight. The words Aerolite , 7auramine , Suprasec and Pluronic appearing in the Examples are registered trade marks. Example c 70 Parts of a crude diphenylmethane diisocyanate composition containing approxir.1ately 55 of diisocyanatodiphenylmethane isomers alld having an NC0 content of 30.74 are mixed with 30 parts of tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate.To this mixture is added a second mixture consisting of 83 parts of a urea formaldehyde resin syrup Ciba GeigyAerolite A 300 , 15 parts of water, 4 parts of 2 methylimidazole and 0.5 parts of Silicone B 14C0 Goldschmidt . The whole composition is thoroughly mixed forning a viscous solution which creans after 15 seconds and then foams rise time 80 seconds . The foam has a fine texture, open cells and a density of 20 kg m3. It is difficult to ignite, is selfextinguishing and gives very little smoke.Example 2 A urea formaldehyde syrup of lower free formaldehyde content than that used in Example 1 was prepared by blending togethtr 179 parts of Aerolite A 300 resin with 32.3 parts of urea dissolved in 15.9 parts of water. After standing for 2 days the modified resin was used in making a foam as inExample 1. Reaction times and density of foam were very similar but the amount of formaldehyde vapours produced as collected flom the reaction mixture foamed in a polythene bag was uuc 1 reduced. By a phenylhydrazone method of analysis there was evolved 0.46 mg. formaldehyde from the reaction mixture used in Example 1 but reduced to 0.10 in the total vapours from the reaction mixture of Example 2.Example 3 A syrup was prepared by dissolving 30 parts of a melamine formaldehyde powder known as Kauramine 650 available from BASF in 12 parts of water, to which were then added 2 parts of 1,2 dimethylimidazole and 0.5 part of Silicone L540 to give the first component. A second component was prepared by adinixture of 10 parts of tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate and 40 parts of a modified diphenylmethane diisocyanate known as Suprasec VM30. After mechanical mixing for 10 seconds a fluid emulsion was obtained which started to rise at 20 seconds and completed foaming in 1 minute to give a fine texture light coloured foam of density 19 kg m which s not friable and displayed similar good fire resistance properties. Example 4 20 Parts of a phenol formaldehyde syrup supplied b akelite as R19595 was diluted with 10 parts of tris 2chloroethyl phosphate and then this was mixed with 1.1 parts 2 methylimidazole dissolved in 3.8 parts of water and 0.1 part of Pluronic L62 when it produced an enulsion. On mixing this with 35 parts of crude diphenylmethane diisocyanate, the initially fluid mix became thixotropic in about 30 seconds.and foaming started at about 90 seconds with end of rise at about 2C3 seconds. The resultant foam jay a density of 130 kg m and displayed good resistance to fire penetration.
