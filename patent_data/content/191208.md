# Production of bis alpha alkylbenzyl ethers.

## Abstract
Bis alpha alkylbenzyl ethers are obtained by the reac tion at elevated temperature of the corresponding alpha alkylbenzyl alcohol in the presence of an acidic clay catalyst having a surface area of at least 100 mÂ² g, quenching of the catalyst and recovery of the desired ether by distillation directly from the reaction mixture containing the quenched catalyst. Where the starting material is alkyl methylbenzyl alcohol, it may be provided in the form of an aromatic rich distilland product mixture derived from the ethyl benzene hydroperoxide epoxidation of an olefinically unsaturated compound such as propylene.
