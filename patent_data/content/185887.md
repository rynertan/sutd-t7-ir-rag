# A METHOD AND DEVICE FOR LOCATING A GROUND FAULT ON A COIL SHAPED ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR

## Abstract
A method and device for locating a ground fault in a conductor of non linear impedance is provided. This may be used with an indication furnace, in which the location of a ground fault on the coil 14 is determined by measuring an electrical characteristic at a first position, with respect to ground, measuring the characteristic between the first position and a second position, and computing the ratio. The ratio is corrected by means of a look up table to compensate for the variations in impedance along the coils length. A graphic representation of the furnace and the location of the fault is also provided.
