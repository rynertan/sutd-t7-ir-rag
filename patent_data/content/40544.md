# Coded information arrangement.

## Abstract
An active transponder device comprises a CMOS inte grated circuit including means 21 for receiving an input signal including coded information, a memory 31 for storing said information, and transmitter means 24 for transmitting an output signal including said information, the input signal and the output signal being both low frequency induction communication signals. Normally, the output signal is emitted in response to an interrogation signal received via the receiving means 21 , and is formed by modulation of that signal with said informa tion after readout from the memory. The transponder oper ates inherently synchronously, using a single master clock signal which is generated either in an interrogation transmit ter or in the programmer for injecting the coded information. The integrated circuit has a second receiving means 41 used in the injection of the coded information. The injection of a clock pulse which is in synchronism with the input signal enables the memory 31 to receive the coded information. The transponder may be used for the identification of e.g. people or articles at the limits of a particular area e.g. a store.
