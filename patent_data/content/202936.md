# Pure amino acid chelates.

## Abstract
Amino acid chelates essentially free of anion radicals, the chelates consisting of a metal ion selected from iron, zinc, manganese, magnesium, copper, calcium or mixtures thereof chelated to one or more ligands selected from alpha amino acids, protein hydrolysates, polypeptides and dipep tides or combinations thereof. A process for the preparation of such chelates comprises the steps of providing a reaction medium or environment substantially completely free of anions, introducing the appropriate amino acid ligands into the medium providing the appropriate metal ions in the reaction free of anions, reacting the ligands with the metal ions and recovering the amino acid chelates in substantially pure form. Preferably, the reaction medium is water and the metal ions are produced electrochemically with the anode and cathode compartments of the cell being separated by a cation permselective membrane. Two preferred electrolytic arrangements involving, respec tively the use of a sacrificial anode and the use of a metal chloride salt in the anode compartment which causes gas to be liberated from the anode are also disclosed. Compositions for increasing the bioavailability of metal ions in humans, animals and plants comprising such che lates in association with biologically acceptable carriers are also disclosed.
