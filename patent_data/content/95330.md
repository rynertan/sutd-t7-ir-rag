## Description
TITLE Herbicidal Cyclohexane l, 3 dione Derivatives This invention relates to organic compounds having biological activity and in particular to organic compounds having herbicidal properties and plant growth regulating properties, to processes for the preparation of such compounds, to intermediates useful in the preparation of such compounds and to herbicidal compositions and processes utilizing such compounds and to plant growth regulating compositions and processes utilizing such compounds. The use of certain cyclohexane 1,3 dione derivatives as grass herbicides is known in the art.For example, the Pesticide Manual C R WorthingEditor, The British Crop Protection Council, 6thEdition 1979 describes the cyclohexane l,3 dione derivative known commercially as alloxydim sodium methyl 3 1 allylOxyimino butyl7 4 hydroxy 6,6 dimethyl 2 oxocyclo hex 3 ene carboxylate and its use as a grass herbicide.This compound is disclosed in Australian Patent No 464 655 and its equivalents such as UK Patent No 1 461 170 and US Patent No 3 950 420. More recently, at the 1980 British CropProtection Conference 1980 British Crop Protection Conference Weeds, Proceedings Vol 1, ResearchReports , pp 39 to 46, British Crop Protection Council, 1980 , a new cyclohexane 1,3 dione grass herbicide code name NP 55 2 N ethoxybutrimidoyl 5 2 ethylthio propyl 3 hydroxy 2 cyclohexen 1 one was announced.This compound is disclosed in Australian Patent No 513 917 and its equivalents. As indicated above, both alloxydim sodium andNP 55 are grass herbicides, that is, herbicides which selectively control the growth of grass weeds monocotyledonous plants in broad leaved crops dicotyledonous plants . At the 1978 International Union of Pure andApplied Chemistry Fourth International Congress ofPesticide Chemistry Advances in Pesticide Science Part 2 , pp 235 243, Pergamon Press, 1979 , in a paper discussing the chemical structure and herbicidal activity of alloxy dim sodium, Iwataki and Hifono made the following disclosure about the herbicidal selected ivity between wheat and oats of certain 5 phenyl substituted cyclohexane 1,3 dione derivatives When substituted phenyl groups were introduced at the C S position Table 6 , the selectivity between wheats and oats such as Avena fatua and Avena sativa was ob served. The selectivity was found only in the case of para substituents at the phenyl nucleus and the effect was not found in the case of di or tri substi tution.Even in the para substituents, the degree of activity or selectivity was different. The best result was obtained when the methyl group was introduced at the para position and the hydroxy or the methoxy deriva tive gave moderately good results. It has now been found that certain novel 5 aryl substituted cyclohexan 1,3 dione derivatives exhibit particularly useful cereal selective herbicidal activity. Accordingly the invention provides a compound of formula I EMI3.1 wherein X, which may be the same or different, are selected from the group consisting of halogen nitro cyano C1 to C6 alkyl C1 to C6 alkyl substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of halogen, nitro, hydroxy, C1 to C6 alkoxy and C1 to C6 alkylthio C2 to C6 alkenyl C2 to C6 alkynyl hydroxy C1 toC6 alkoxy C1 to C6 alkoxy substituted with a substituent selected from halogen and C1 toC6 alkoxy C2 to C6 alkenyloxy C2 to C6 alkynyloxy C2 to C6 alkanoyloxy C1 to C6 alkoxy carbonyl C1 to C6 alkylthio C1 to C6 alkylsulfinyl C1 to C6 alkylsulfonyl sulfamoyl N r to C6 alkyl sulfamoyl N,N di C1 to C6 alkyl sulfamoyl benzyloxy substituted benzyloxy wherein the benzene ring is substituted with from one to three substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, nitro,C1 to Y16 alkyl, C1 to C6 alkoxy and C1 to C6 haloalkyl 56 5 6 the group NR R wherein R and R are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1 to C6 alkyl, C2 to C6 alkanoyl, benzoyl and benzyl the groups formyl and C2 to C6 alkanoyl and the oxime, imine andSchiff base derivatives thereof Y and Z are independently selected from methylene, oxygen and sulfur provided that at least one of Y and Z is selected from oxygen and sulfur R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen C1 to C6 alkyl C2 to C6 alkenyl C2 to C6 alkynyl substituted C1 to C6 alkyl wherein the alkyl group is substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of C1 to C6 alkoxy, C1 to C6 alkylthio, phenyl and substituted phenyl wherein the benzene ring is substituted with from one to three substituents selected from the group consistingof halogen, nitro, cyano, C1 to C6 alkyl, C1 to C6 haloalkyl, C1 to C6 alkoxy and C1 to C6 alkylthio C1 to C6 alkyl sulfonyl benzenesulfonyl substituted benzenesulfonyl wherein the benzene ring is substituted with from one to three substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, nitro, cyano, C1 to C6 alkyl, C1 to C6 haloalkyl, C1 toC6 alkoxy and C1 to C6 alkylthio an acyl group and an inorganic or organic cation R2 is selected from the group consisting of C1 to C6 alkyl C2 to C6 alkenyl C2 to C6 haloalkenyl C2 to C6 alkynyl C2 to C6 haloalkynyl substituted C1 to C6 alkyl wherein the alkyl group is substituted with a substituent selected fran the group consisting of halogen,C1 to C6 alkoxy, C1 to C6 alkylthio, phenyl and substituted phenyl wherein the benzene ring is substituted with from one to three substituents selected fram the group consisting of halogen, nitro, cyano, C1 to C6 alkyl, C1 to C6 haloalkyl, C1 to C6 alkoxy and C1 to C6 alkylthio 3 R is selected from the group consisting of C1 to C6 alkyl C1 to C6 fluoroalkyl C2 to C6 alkenyl C2 to C6 alkynyl and phenyl R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen halogen cyano C1 to C6 alkyl and C1 to C6 alkoxy carbonyl n is an integer selected from 1 to 3 and m is zero or an integer selected from 1 to 3. When in the compound of formula I X is selected from the group formyl and C2 to C6 alk anoyl and the oxime, imine and Schiff base derivatives thereof, the nature of the oxime, imine and Schiff base derivatives is not narrowly critical. Although not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that in the plant the substituted imine group may be removed to give the corresponding compound of formula I in which X is formyl or C2 to C6 alkanoyl. Suitable values for the groups formyl and C2 to C6 alkanoyl and the oxime, imine andSchiff base derivatives thereof include groups of the formula C R7 NR8 wherein R7 is selected from hydrogen and C1 to C5 alkyl and R8 is selected from hydrogen, C to C6 alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, hydroxy, C1 to C6 alkoxy, phenoxy and benzyloxy. When in the compound of formula I R1 is selected from acyl the nature of the acyl group is not narrowly critical.

Suitable acyl groups include alkanoyl, for exampleC2 to C6 alkanoyl aroyl, for example benzoyl and substituted benzoyl wherein the benzene ring ring is substituted with from one to threp substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, nitro, cyano, C1 to C6 alkyl, C1 to C6 haloalkyl, C1 to C6 alkoxy and C1 to C6 alkylthio and heteroaroyl, for example 2 furoyl, 3furoyl, 2 thenoyl and 3 thenoyl. When in the compound of formula I R1 is selected from an inorganic or organic cation the nature of the cation is not narrowly critical. Although not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that when R1 is a cation the cation may be removed in the plant to give a compound of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen. Suitable inorganic cations include the alkali and alkaline earth metal ions, heavy metal ions including the transition metal ions, and the ammonium ion.Suitable organic cations include the cation R9RlORllRl2N wherein R9, R10, 1l and R12 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen C1 to C10 alkyl substituted C1 to C10 alkyl wherein the alkyl group is substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, halogen and C1 to C6 alkoxy phenyl benzyl and the groups substituted phenyl and substituted benzyl wherein the benzene ring is substituted with fram one to three substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, nitro, cyano, C1 toC6 alkyl, C1 to C6 haloalkyl, C1 to C6 alkoxy and C1 to C6 alkylthio.

Certain of the intermediate compounds of formulaeVI, VIII, IX, X, XII, XXI, XIII, XVI and XVIII are novel compounds and therefore as a further embodiment the invention provides novel compounds of formulae VI, VIII,IX, X, XII, XXI, XIII, XVI and XVIII, wherein the substituents are as hereinbefore defined, and processes for the preparation thereof. The compounds of formula I are active as herbicides and therefore, in a further aspect the invention provides a process for severely damaging or killing unwanted plants which process comprises applying to the plants, or to the growth medium of the plants, an effective amount of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined. Generally speaking the compounds of formula I are herbicidally effective against monocotyledonous plants, or grasses. However, certain of the compounds of formula I are selectively active within the group of monocotyledonous plants and may be used at a rate sufficient to kill or severely damage monocotyledonous weeds in a monocotyledonous cereal crop. Therefore, in yet a further aspect the invention provides a process for selectively controlling the growth of weeds in crops which process comprises applying to the crop, or to the growth medium of the crop, a compound of formula I, as hereinbefore defined, in an amount sufficient to severely damage or kill the weeds but insufficient to damage the crop substantially. The compounds of formula I may be applied directly to the plant post emergence application or to the soil before the emergence of the plant preemergence application2. However, the compounds are, in general, more effective when applied to the plant postemergence. The compounds of formula I may be used on their own to inhibit the growth of, severely damage, or kill plants but are preferably used in the form of a composition comprising a compound of the invention in admixture with a carrier canprising. a solid or liquid diluent. Therefore, in yet a further aspect the invention provides plant growth inhibiting, plant damaging, or plant killing compositions comprising a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined and an inert carrier there for. Certain of the compounds of formula I exhibit useful plant growth regulating activity. For example, while certain compounds of formula I show selective herbicidal activity against wild grasses in crops of cultivated plants, at some rates of application they exhibit plant growth regulating effects in said crops. Plant growth regulating effects may be mani fested in a number of ways. For example, suppression of apical dominance, stimulation of auxiliary bud growth, stimulation of early flowering and increase in seed formation, enhancement of flowering and increase in seed yield, stem thickening, stem shortening and tillering. Plant growth regulating effects shown by compounds of the invention include, for example, tillering and stem shortening in crops such as wheat and barley. Accordingly in a still further aspect the invention provides a process for regulating the growth of a plant which process comprises applying to the plant, to the seed of the plant, or to the growth medium of the plant, an effective amount of a compound of formulaI, as hereinbefore defined. To effect the plant growth regulating process of the present invention the compounds of formula I may be applied directly to the plant post emergence application or to the seed or soil before the emergence of the plant pre emergence application. The compounds of formula I may be used on their own to regulate the growth of plants but in general are preferably used in the form of a composition comprising a compound of the invention in admixture with a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. Therefore, in a still further aspect the invention provides plant growth regulating compositions comprising a compound of formulaI as hereinbefore defined and an inert carrier therefor. The compositions of the present invention may be in the form of solids, liquids or pastes. The compositions include both dilute compositions which are ready for immediate use and concentrated compositions which may require dilution before use. Therefore, the concentration of the active ingredient in the compositions of the present invention will vary depending on the type of formulation and whether the composition is ready for use such as, for example, a dust formulation or an aqueous emulsion or whether the composition is a concentrate such as, for example, an emulsifiable concentrate or a wettable powder, which is suitable for dilution before use. In general the compositions of the present invention comprise from 1 ppm to 99 by weight of active ingredient.

Alternatively, the solid compositions may be in the form of dispersible or wettable dusts, powders, granules or grains wherein the active ingredient and the solid carrier are combined with one or more surface active agents which act as wetting, emulsifying and or dispersing agents to facilitate the dispersion of the active ingredient in liquid. Examples of surface active agents include those of the cationic, anionic and non ionic type. Cationic surface active agents include quaternary ammonium compounds, for example, the long chain alkylammonium salts such as cetyltrimethylaimnonium bromide.

The liquid compositions may comprise a solution or dispersion of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier optionally containing one or more surface active agents which act as wetting, emulsifying and or dispersing agents. Examples of liquid carriers include water mineral oil fractions such as, for example, kerosene, solvent naphtha, petroleum, coal tar oils and aromatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, paraffin, cyclohexane, toluene, the xylenes, tetrahydronaphthalene and alkylated naphthalenes alcohols such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, cyclohexanol and propylene glycol ketones such as, for example, cyclohexanone and isophorone and strongly polar organic solvents such as, for example, dimethyl formamide, dimethylsulfoxide, N methylpyrrolidone and sulfolane. A preferred liquid composition comprises an aqueous suspension, dispersion or emulsion of the active ingredient which is suitable for application by spraying, atomizing or watering. Such aqueous compositions are generally prepared by mixing concentrated compositions with water. Suitable concentrated compositions include emulsion concentrates, pastes, oil dispersions, aqueous suspensions and wettable powders. The concentrates are usually required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage to be capable of dilution with water to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates conveniently contain from 20 to 99 , preferably 20 to 60 , by weight of active ingredient. Emulsion or emulsifiable concentrates are conveniently prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in an organic solvent containing one or more surface active agents. Pastes may be prepared by blending the finely divided active ingredient with a finely divided solid carrier, one or more surface active agents and optionally an oil. Oil dispersions may be prepared by grinding together the active ingredient, a hydrocarbon oil, and one or more surface active agents. Aqueous suspension concentrates may conveniently be prepared by ball milling a mixture of the active ingredient, water, at least one surface active agent and preferably at least one suspending agent.Suitable suspending agents include hydrophilic colloids such as, for example, poly N vinylpyrrolidone , sodium carboxymethylcellulose and the vegetable gums gum acacia and gum tragacanth hydrated colloidal mineral silicates such as, for example, montmorillonite, beidellite, nontronite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite and bentonite other cellulose derivatives and poly vinyl alcohol . Wettable powder concentrates may conveniently be prepared by blending together the active ingredient, one or more surface active agents, one or more solid carriers and optionally one or more suspending agents and grinding the mixture to give a powder having the required particle size. The aqueous suspensions, dispersions or emulsions may be prepared from the concentrated compositions by mixing the concentrated compositions with water optionally containing surface active agents and or oils. It should be noted that the compounds of the invention of formula I wherein R is hydrogen are acidic.Therefore, the compounds of formula I may be formulated and applied as the salts of organic or inorganic bases.In formulating and employing the compounds of formula I in the form of their salts, either the salts per se, that is the compounds of formula I wherein R1is an inorganic or an organic cation, may be used in the formulation or the compounds of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen may be used in the formulation and the salts generated in situ by the use of the appropriate organic or inorganic base. The mode of application of the compositions of the invention will depend to a large extent on the type of composition used and the facilities available for its application. Solid compositions may be applied by dusting or any other suitable means for broadcasting or spreading the solid. Liquid compositions may be applied by spraying, atomizing, watering, introduction into the irrigation water, or any other suitable means for broadcasting or spreading the liquid. The rate of application of the compounds of the invention will depend on a number of factors including, for example, the compound chosen for use, the identity of the plants whose growth is to be inhibited the formulations selected for use and whether the compound is to be applied for foliage or root uptake. As a general guide, however, an application rate of from O.005 to 20 kilograms per hectare is suitable while from 0.01 to 5.0 kilograms per hectare may be preferred. The compositions of the invention may comprise, in addition to one or more compounds of the invention, one or more compounds not of the invention but which possess biological activity. For example, as hereinbefore indicated the compounds of the invention are in general substantially more effective against mono cotyledonous plants or grass species than against dicotyledonous plants or broad leaved species. As a result, in certain applications the herbicidal use of the compounds of the invention alone may not be sufficient to protect a crop. Accordingly in yet a still further embodiment the invention provides a herbicidal composition comprising a mixture of at least one herbicidal compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined with at least one other herbicide.
