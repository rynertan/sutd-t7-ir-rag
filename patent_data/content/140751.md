# CACHE INVALIDATION MECHANISM FOR MULTIPROCESSOR SYSTEMS

## Abstract
In digital computer systems having one or more memory devices accessible to a number of separate system elements 50, 52 interconnected by a common communications path 08 , one or more memory devices 54, 56 accessible by various elements without use of the common path, and one or more cache memories 190 storing local copies of data from the memory devices, the integrity of the cached data is pre served by notifying all cache devices 190 which may store data from a given memory element 54 of accesses to said element which do not take place along the common commu nications path.
