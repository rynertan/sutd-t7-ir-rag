## Description
LOW INTERSTITIAL CORROSION RESISTANT WELDABLE FERRITIC STAINLESS STEEL AND PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE THEREOF The present invention relates to a low interstitial, corrosion resistant, weldable ferritic stainless steel with improved toughness and to a process for the manufacture thereof. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a low interstitial, corrosion resistant, weldable ferritic stainless steel with a small addition of either columbium or titanium to improve the toughness when the maximum achievable cooling rate is limited. A ferritic stainless steel must have superior pitting and crevice corrosion resistance in order to be used in certain chemical environments as for example in power plants exposed to sea water, and pulp and paper process equipment.Stainless steel containing 29 chromium and 4 molybdenum are highly resistant to crevice corrosion. These steels require a low level of interstitials, for example a total carbon plus nirtogen content of less than 0.025 by weight, to have good post welding ductility and intergranular corrosion resistance. The applications mentioned above often require heavy gauge supporting products such as plate, as weil as light gauge welded tubing such as condenser tubing. This equipment is often assembled through a welding process. The shape and size of the assembled equipment usually prevents the use of a final heat treatment or, if capable of a final heat treatment, the shape and size often severely limit the ability of the assembled equipment to cool rapidly from the heat treating temperature. Moreover, the toughness of the alloy decreases as the thickness increases and as the cooling rate decreases. This is illustrated in Figure 12 in a paper by H.E.Deverall entitled 11Toughness Properties of VacuumInduction Melted High Chromium Ferritic Stainless Steels , published in ASTM STP 706, Toughness of Ferritic StainlessSteels, R A. Lula, Ed., American Society for Testing andMaterials, 1980. The decrease in toughness decreases weldability such that the plate, which in some instances may be incapable of being water quenched because of its size, might exhibit cracking during welding. Or, if the plate is water quenched, the cooling rate because of the thickness of the plate may not be rapid enough to achieve suitable toughness such that the plate may exhibit cracking during welding.Therefore, better toughness must be achieved by some other means where water quenching is impractical or where waterquenching does not achieve suitable toughness to improve the weldability of the various components comprising the final assembled struc ture. Even if the final product is to be of light gauge, the conventional production methods require the cooling of thicker slabs and bands during processing. The cooling rates of these heaviersection sizes is slow. Water quenching would speed up the cooling process, however water quenching is often impossible or impractical due to shape and size. As the thickness of the product section increases, the toughness as measured by Charpy impact transition temperature decreases. Toughness is the ability of a metal to absorb energy by deforming plastically before fracturing.The transition temperature is the temperature at which the fracture which occurs from the impact is 50 percent shear ductile and 50 percent cleavage brittle . The toughness of the 29 chromium 4 molybdenum alloy is low compared to substantially lower chromium alloys of an equivalent carbon and nitrogen content because of the high alloy content. The toughness of the 29 chromium 4 molybdenum alloy is improved by water quenching to speed up the cooling process instead of the slower air cooling. However, in many cases the water quenching process is not possible or practical to use, so a method is needed to improve the toughness of the steel in those situations where the maximum cooling rate is limited. A 29 chromium 4 molybdenum ferritic stainless steel with a maximum carbon plus nitrogen content of 0.025 is disclosed in United States Patent No. 3,929,473. United States Patent No. 3,932,174 is a modification to which small amounts of other elements are added to achieve the same range of corrosion properties as United States Patent No. 3,929,473.However these patents do not teach the use of columbium or titanium. United States Patent No. 3,807,991 teaches the addition of between 13 and 29 times the amount of nitrogen or between 0.065 and 0.363 columbium to a steel of 1 molybdenum for improved toughness and intergranular corrosion resistance in the air cooled condition. United States Patent 3,957,544 discusses the addition of titanium and columbium according to the equation Ti 6 CB 8 C N3 The molybdenum content of the steels in these patents is lower than that of the present invention. The presence of titanium and columbium in the steel reduces the susceptibility of a steel to intergranular attack, but the weldability of the steel is poor unless the level of interstitials is low. Molybdenum improves pitting and crevice corrosion resistance,but according to United States Patent 4,119,765 if molybdenum is present in an amount of over 3.5 and is combined with chromium, titanium, silicon or columbium, the notch toughness is reduced, especially in the as welded condition. United States Patent 4,119,765 adds from 2 4.75 nickel to improve the weldability of the steel. The amount of nickel must be regulated carefully so as to improve notch toughness and acid corrosion resistance without interfering with other properties.

This reference does not disclose the ferritic stainless steel of the present invention. For the reasons noted hereinabove, the present invention is distinguishable from the references referred to. An object of the present invention is to provide a low interstitial, corrosion resistant, weldable ferritic stainless steel with a high molybdenum content which exhibits improves toughness in heavier section thickness when the maximum achievable cooling rate is limited. A further object of the present invention is to provide a low interstitial, corrosion resistant, weldable ferritic stainless steel with a high molybdenum content which exhibits improved toughness due to a small addition of either columbium or titanium. In particular, this invention provides a low interstitial ferritic stainless steel which is corrosion resistant and weldable at room temperature. The improvement of the present invention being an addition of a small critical amount of columbium and or titanium to improve the toughness of the steel in situations where water quenching is impossible or impractical. The present invention provides a low interstitial, corrosion resistant, weldable ferritic stainless steel with improved toughness characterized in that it consists of, by weight percent 25.O 35.O chromium, 3.6 5.6 molybdenum, less than 3 nickel, less than 2 manganese, less than 2.0 silicon, less than 0.5 aluminum, less than 0.50 copper, less than 0.050 phosphorus, less than 0.05 sulfer, less than 0.01 carbon, less than 0.02 nitrogen, the sum of the carbon and nitrogen being less than 0.025 , O.05 050E of columbium and or titanium, and the balance of iron. The present invention further provides a process for the manufacture of ferritic stainless steel of improved toughness wherein said steel is hot rolled, annealed and cold rolled to strip thickness, characterized in that the process comprises air cooling from the annealing temperature before cold rolling a ferritic stainless steel consisting essentially of, by weight per cent 25.0 35.0 chromium, 3.6 5.6 molybdenum, less than 3.0 nickel, less than 2.0 manganese, less than 2.0 silicon, less than 0.5 aluminum, less than 0.58 copper, less than 0.5 phosphorus, less than 0.05 sulfer, less than 0.01 carbon, less than 0.028 nitrogen, the sum of the carbon and nitrogen being less than 0.025 , 0.05 0.50 of columbium and or titanium, and the balance iron, so as to produce a steel with a Charpy impact transition temperature of below 17.80C OOF as cold rolled to a thickness of 1.575mm 0.062 inches . Chromium and molybdenum are preferably present in respective amounts of 28.5 to 30.5 and 3.75 to 4.75 .Columbium and or titanium is present preferably in the amount of 0.05 to 0.20 . Manganese and silicon are each usually present in amounts of less than 1 . Aluminum, copper, phosphorous, and sulfer are present usually in amounts of less than 0.1 . Carbon and nitrogen are present preferably in amounts of less than 0.008 and 0.016 respectively. The advantages of the steel of this invention will be apparent from the following description which is illustrative of several aspects of the invention. This invention relates to a low interstitial ferritic stainless steel having a chromium content of between 25.0 and 35.0 and a molybdenum content of between 3.6 and 5.62. A small amount of columbium or titanium of between 0.05 and 0.20 is added to the steel composition to improve its toughness when the maximum achievable cooling rate is limited.

The hot rolled band was annealed at a temperature of 10100C 18500F ., and water quenched and cold rolled to a thickness of 1.57mm 0.062 in. . The strip was then annealed at a temperature of 10100C 18500F , water quenched and TIG welded. Four sets of transverse Charpy V notch impact subsize specimens were taken, two from the hot robed band and the others from the 1.575mm 0.062 in. thick strips.After annealing the specimens at a temperature of 10100C 18500F , the specimens were either water quenched or aircooled. The cooled specimens were then tested for toughness characteristics. The results of the tests are shown in Table II. Table II Impact Transition Temperature C F 3.556mm 0.140 in.

Whereas the difference in impact transition temperature for prior art compositions is 115 C 240 F . However, in situations where water quenching is impractical or in situations where the cooling rates achieved by water quenching of heavy thickness sections approach or are slower than those of air cooling lighter thickness sections, the addition of columbium improves the toughness. The impact transition temperature of the 1.575mm 0.062 in. steel strip of a composition according to the present invention is below 17.80C OOF whereas that of prior art composition A is 540C 1300F . It is essential that the impact transition temperature of such a steel strip be below room temperature so that the steel strip will not crack upou welding. Steels of prior art compositions had to be water quenched before cold rolling in order to achieve the necessary toughness characteristics.The composition of this invention enables us to achieve good toughness characteristics by air cooling the steel before cold rolling instead. Corrosion tests were also performed on the 1.575mm 0.062 in. thick strip in the as welded condition and on the base metal specimens which were heat treated at 12320C 22500F and air cooled to simulate the heat affected zone upon welding a heavier thickness. The specimens 25.4mm x 50.8mm 1 in. x 2 in. were exposed to a boiling solution of ferritic sulfate 50 sulfuric acid for 120 hours according to ASTM A262 Practice B for intergranular corrosion testing.
