# Anisotropic polymers having improved retention of physical properties at elevated temperatures and methods of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
An anisotropic melt forming polymer having improved stiffness retention at elevated temperatures comprising residues selected from residues A of dihydric phenols, aromatic dicarboxylic acids, hydroxyaromatic acids, aromatic diamines, aminophenols and aminoaromatic acids wherein at least 40 mole of the residues A have their chain extending bonds in either coaxial or parallel and oppositely directed relationship and sufficient of non linear residues B selected from at least one of
