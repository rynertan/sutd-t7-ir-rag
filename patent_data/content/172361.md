# CLONED CARDIONATRIN CDNA, CLEAVED CARDIONATRIN CDNA AND CARDIONATRIN PRECURSORS, THEIR PREPARATION, CORRESPONDING PLASMIDS AND MICROORGANISMS COMPRISING SAID PLASMID

## Abstract
A novel cloned cardionatrin cDNA is produced from rat atria. The cardionatrin cDNA codes for a pro cardionatrin precursor, which contains cardionatrin 1 28 at its C terminal end. Also provided are methods of making the cloned cardionatrin cDNA, pro cardionatrin, a cleaved cDNA which codes exclusively for the cardionatrin 1 28, corresponding plasmids and transformed microorganisms.
