# A TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED, METAL VAPOR DISCHARGE LAMP

## Abstract
A lamp which is particularly useful in supplying high intensity ultraviolet radiation for use in the manufacture of large scale integrated circuit chips employs means to controllably heat the end portions so as to maintain the lamp at optimally efficient temperatures. Furthermore, the lamp of the present invention employs heat insulating means surrounding a portion of the lamp discharge so as to maintain the envelope wall temperatures at suf ficiently high temperatures to prevent condensation of the discharge medium or other materials thereon.
