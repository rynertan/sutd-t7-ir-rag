The accompanying illustration shows a comparison of Raman spectra from which it may be concluded that the local order of the present fibres is the amorphous counterpart of the puckered layer like, sheet like crystalline structure of black phosphorus. In general terms, pnictide thin films, particularly phosphorus, grown on III V semiconductors, particularly InP, GaP and GaAs, are amorphous and have a novel layer like, puckered sheet like local order. The thin films are typically 400 Angstroms 4 x 10 6 cms thick and grown preferably by molecular beam deposition, although other processes, such as vacuum evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapour deposition and deposition from a liquid melt, may be used. The layers may be grown on the 100 , 110 and 111 surface of III V crystals.

## Description
Passivation and insulation of III V devices with pnictides, particularly amorphous pnictides having a layer like structure This invention relates to the passivation and insulation of III V devices with pnictides, particularly amorphous pnictides having a layer like more particularly puckered sheet like structure it also relates to compound, intermetallic semiconductors, particularly III V semiconductors to pnictide and polypnictides, particularly phosphorus and polyphosphides to MIS and metal semiconductor Schottky devices, particularly MISFETS andMESFETS to light absorbing diodes, particularly P I N and avalanche detector diodes, solar cells and photocathodes and to light emitting diodes and lasers. For further information, reference may be made to, for example, GP A 2,113,663 and to the related applications filed herewith, in particular those based on USSN 581,139,USSN 509,157, USSN 509,175, USSN 581,104, USSN 509,158,USSN 581,103, USSN 581,105, USSN 581,102 and USSN 581,101. III V semiconductors have desirable properties of higher carrier mobility than silicon. They have been successfully employed in metal semiconductor Schottky devices, but have not been commercially employed in the more widely useful metal insulator semiconductor MIS devices. A reason for this is thut the native oxides of the III V materials do not form thermodynamically stable layers thereon in the way that silicon dioxide layers may be formed on silicon to form MIS devices. Silicon oxynitride and Si3N4 have been used as an insulating layer on III V materials with limited success. The pass ivation of III V semiconductors has been a problem for the same reasons. Thus, it is highly desirable to find a material and a means of production thereof, which readily forms an insulating and passivating layer on III V materials and thus provide the basis for the formation of MIS andSchottky devices, particularly MISFETS AND MESFETS. Similarly, it is desirable to reduce the surface component of currents in III V opto electronic devices by passivating the surface thereof. It is also desirable to decrease the carrier recombination velocity at the surface of III V optoelectronic devices. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide insulating layers for semiconductors comprising pnictides. Another object of the present invention is to provide passivating layers for semiconductors comprising pnictides. A further object of the present invention is to provide a new form of amorphous pnictides. Still another object of the present invention is to provide improved MIS and Schottky devices includingMISFETS and MESFETS. A still further object of the present invention is to provide improved opto electronic devices, including light emitting and light collecting devices, such asP I N and avalanche diodes, solar cells, photocathodes, light emitting diodes and lasers. The present invention provides a semiconductor characterised in that it has a pnictide rich layer on a surface thereof. The semiconductor may be a III V semiconductor or a compound semiconductor comprising a pnictide. For example, the semiconductor in accordance with the present invention may be a metal insulutor semiconductor device, a metal semiconductor device, a MISFET, a MESFET, an opto electronic device, a light emitting device, a light receiving device, a P I N photodiode, an avalanche photodiode, a solar cell, a laser or a photocathode. In these cases, the pnictide layer acts as an insulator and or passivates the surface of the semiconductor and or reduces the density of surface states at the surface of the semiconductor and or reduces the recombination velocity of charge carriers at the surface of the semiconductor and or increases the photoluminescence of the semiconductor. The pnictide rich layer may extend across layers of differing composition. The present layer may comprise a polypnictide. The semiconductor material may be GaAs, Inp or GaP. The pnictide may be phosphorus, arsenic, antimony or bismuth. It may be an alkali metal e.g. K pnictide. For example, the pnictide may be a polypnictide having the formula MPX wherein M represents an alkali x metal, P represents a pnictide and x ranges from 15 to infinity. Alternatively, it may be elemental. The pnictide may have a layer like local order, which is preferably puckered sheet like. A further aspect of the present invention relates to such new form pnictide, which may be formed below 30000, preferably at Iv 2000. According to the present invention, the pnictide layer is deposited, for example by co evaporating in vacuo a pnictide and an alkali metal, by deposition from P2 vapour species, by sputtering, by molecular beam deposition, by vacuum deposition or by chemical vapour deposition. It has been discovered that insulating, passivating and surface recombination velocity reducing pnictide rich layers may be formed on III V semiconductor substrates by various methods that pnictide rich layers may be formed on any substrate. These include vacuum coevaporation, sputtering, chemical vapour deposition, twosource vapour transport, deposition from a liquid melt and molecular beam deposition, which produces the best results. In particular, there has been deposited an alkali metal polyphosphide layer, namely KP15, on gallium arsenide, gallium phosphide, indium phosphide and Si.There have also been deposited insulating and passivating layers of high x alkali metal polyphosphides having the formula MPX, wherein x is greater than 15, on these materials. For all practical purposes, such very high x materials are elemental phosphorus. Elemental phosphorus layers have also been deposited on substrates of gallium arsenide, go ilium phosphide and indium phosphide using these same processes.Other III V semiconductors may also be used as substrates. It is contemplated that other high pnictide polypnictides, particularly alkali metal polypnictides and other elemental pnictides comprising Group V atoms will also form useful insulating layers and semiconductors comprising a pnictide. These pnictide materials are insulators or very high resistivity semiconductors, good film formers and the pnictides, being Group V materials, provide chemical continuity, matching order and adhesion to the Group V atoms of the Group V containing semiconductors. The present insulating. layers have a resistivity of greater than 10 10 ohm cm. which is greater than the resistivity of the III V materials. Another Si3N4 layer has been successfully added on top of a pnictide layer of III V materials to provide a higher breakdown voltage. The amorphous layers employed have a local order not found before in amorphous pnictide films deposited on a III V substrate. This is a layer like puckered sheetlike structure similar to black phosphorus. This structure apparently forms at low effective energies at the surface during the deposition. Thus, invacuum evaporation and molecular beam deposition when the surface is maintained below approximately 2000C, this new layer like puckered sheet amorphous polyphosphide material forms. Similarly, at low energies and at temperatures below approximately 3000C, the same material forms in a sputterer. The material is formed by deposition from excess phosphorus supplied as P4 vapour, which is cracked to P2 vapour by a heated cracker in the case of vacuum deposition and molecular beam deposition and is cracked by the plasma in a sputterer. The surface layers according to the present invention reduce the density of surface states, allow modulation of the depletion layer, reduce the surface barrier, increase the surface electron concentration, increase the photoluminescence intensity and decrease the surface carrier recombination velocity. The pnictide layers according to the present invention may be used to insulate and passivate MIS and Schottky devices, particularly MISFETS and MESFETS, to reduce the surface current between different layers in III V devices, such as the dark current in reverse biased light detecting diodes, particularly P I N and avalanche diodes, and to increase the efficiency of light emitting and light collecting opto electronic devices, particularly solar cells, photocathodes, lightemitting diodes, lasers and photo detectors.

The same reference characters refer to the same elements throughout the several view of the drawings. It has now been found that pnictides films grown at relatively low temperatures, below 3000C at low powers in sputtering and below 2000C in vacuum evaporation and molecular beam deposition, have a puckered sheet like, layer like structure similar to black phosphorus. These amorphous films are deposited from phosphorus in the form of P4 vapour which is cracked by the plasma in sputtering and by a heated cracker in vacuum evaporation and molecular beam deposition. Reference may be made to the above mentioned related applications, in particular those based on USSN 581,139,USSN 581,103 and USSN 581,104, for a fuller understanding of these processes. It has now been found that pure phosphorus films and presumably films of other pure pnictides, form the best insulation and passivating layers on III V materials.This is because the pnictide layer is capable of matching the pnictides within the III V semiconductors. Polypnictides, particularly MPX, wherein M represents an alkali metal and x ranges from 15 to infinity, may also be used. The present insulating and passivating films may be used on any compound or intermetallic semiconductor comprising a pnictide. Such films have been deposited on the 111 , 100 and 110 of various III V semiconductors. The best results to date have been with phosphorus films having a typical thickness of approximately 400A 4 x 10 6 cms deposited on III V semiconductors solely from a phosphorus source by molecular beam deposition. Accompanying Figure 1 illustrates a comparison of the Roman spectra of polyphosphide films grown by vacuum evaporation 250 C and molecular beam deposition 2000 . The solid line spectrum, when the substrate is at 25000, is typical spectrum similar to amorphous red phosphorus indicating a local order comprising parallel pentagonal tubes. The dotted line spectrum of the film formed at approximately 2000 indicates a much different local order. Films produced by sputtering at temperatures less than that or equal to approximately 3000C have the same Roman spectra as the 2000 molecular beam deposition results illustrated in Figure 1. Accompanying Figure 2 illustrates a comparison of the Roman spectrum of film grown at a substrate temperature of 200C, shown in dotted lines, with a theoretical prediction of the spectrum of a puckered sheet like, layer like, structure similar to black phosphorus. It is concluded that the local order of these films is the amorphous counterpart of the puckered layer like, sheet like, crystalline structure of black phashpharus. This local order is simpler than that of the films described in the above identified related applications which have a local order comprising pentagonal tubes.It has been found that the energy band gap of this new form of amorphous phosphorus according to the present invention is approximately 1.7eV versus a band gap of approximately 2.0eV for amorphous red phosphorus. No photoconductivity or photoluminescence has been detected from phosphorus films of this type. The films are shiny, hard and stable. It is concluded that these films would be good candidates for insulating and passivating layers of Ill V materials. Results of electrical measurements of phosphorus thin films grown on indium phosphide and gallium arsenide Amorphous thin films of phosphorus of a typical thickness of 400A 4 x 10 cms have been grown by molecular beam deposition on the 100 surface of InP and the 100 surface of GaAs, the substrates being maintained at room temperature, approximately 230C. The InP is specified by the manufacturer to contain 15 2 x 10 free electrons per cubic centimetre the gallium arsenide to contain 2 x 1016 free electrons per cubic centimetre. Accompaying Figure 3 illustrates a comparison of the theoretical solid line and experimental dotted line data plots of normalized capacitance versus voltage for an MIS structure on InP. The solid line theoretical curve is computed for the case of ideal conditions, namely a perfect insulation and a negligibly small density of surface states. Excellent agreement between experiment and theory is shown in these high frequency C V curves. This indicates that a low density of surface states has been achieved by the phosphorus layer on the InP and that the phosphorus layer allows modulation of the depletion layer. The density of the surface states may be calculated by Terman s method. Accompanying Figure 4 illustrates a comparison of the density of surface states for passivation with Six2, Al203, P3N5 and P present phosphorus layer and it may be seen that there has now been achieved the lowest density of surface states reported on III V materials. EC in Figure 4 is the energy of the conduction band and EV is the energy of the valence band. Accompanying Figure 5 illustrates such a comparison for GaAs. It will be seen that the depletion layer has been modulated, but that the density of surface states has not been reduced as much as in the case of InP. Passivation studies of phosphorus layers on GaAs Accompanying Figure 6 illustrates a comparison of the intensities of the Roman spectra of GaAs with and without the present phosphorus thin film layer. That of the plain GaAs is indicated by a dotted line and GaAs having the present phosphorus film is indicated by a solid line. These data suggests a reduction of the surface barrier of the GaAs when the phosphorus barrier is present.This indicates that the phosphorus layer may be used inMIS and Schottky devices and for the improvement of the performance of opto electronic devices. Accompanying Figure 7 illustrates a comparison of the line shape of the photoluminescence of GaAs with and without a phosphorus thin film GaAs alone is shown dotted GaAs with phosphorus in solid . It may be concluded from this diagram that there is an increase of the electron concentration at the surface of the GaAs when a phosphorus thin film is present. Since this behaviour is expected if the surface barrier has decreased, this is consistent with the results illustrated in Figure 6. Accompanying Figure 8 illustrates that there is an increase in the intensity of the photoluminescence produced from GaAs when phosphorus thin film is present. The photoluminescence intensity of GaAs alone is shown by the dotted line and intensity with the phosphorus film is shown by the solid line. This increase in photoluminescence again indicates a decrease in number of surface states when the phosphorus thin film is present. This result is consistent with Figures 6 and 7. The phosphorus film for Figures 6, 7 and 8 was grown on the 111 surface of GaAs specified by the manufacturer to have 7 x 1017 free electrons per cubic centimetre. It is concluded that the GaAs surface barrier has been reduced when a phosphorus thin film having a layerlike, puckered sheet like local order is deposited on the GaAs. The present experiments indicate a reduction of one order of magnitude in the density of the surface states. The increase of the photoluminescence intensity which has been noted is extremely important for optoelectronic devices. It means that there is a decrease in the surface recombination velocity. Thus, it has been shown that a polypnictide surface film having a layer like, puckered sheet like local order deposited upon III V semiconductors produces a reduction in the density of surface states, allows the modulation of the depletion layer, reduces the surface barrier, increases the free electron concentration at the surface, increases the photoluminescence intensity and decreases the surface recombination velocity.Devices according to the present invention Now, referring to accompanying illustrativeFigure 9, a MISFET according to the present invention comprises a body of III V semiconducting material 20, islands 22 of high conductivity, a conduction channel 24 therebetween, source and drain metal contacts 26, gate metal contact 28, insulating layer 30 and passivating layers 32. According to the present invention, the I layer 30 and the passivating layers 32, which may be unitary and deposited on the substrate 20 at the same time, are the new amorphous layer like phosphorus or other layer like pnictide rich materials, such as MP15, wherein M represents an alkali metal, and hPX, wherein M represents an alkali metal and x varies from 15 to infinity, particularly where the alkali metal is potassium. Accompanying Figure 10 illustrates a MESFET according to the present invention. This comprises a III V semiconductor body 34, islands 36 of high conductivity, source and drain contacts 38, gate contact 40, conduction channel 42 and passivating layers 44 according to the present invention. The layers 44 reduce the surface currents from the source and the drain to the gate. According to the present invention, another MIS device utilizing a III V substrate may be formed as illustrated in accompanying Figure 11. There, the III V substrate, generally indicated at 2, is appropriately doped to form P regions 4 and N regions 6 therein. The polypnictide or elemental pnictide layer 8 is then deposited thereon, according to the present invention, appropriately masked and etched, and then a metal, such as aluminium, is deposited to form drain 10, gate 12 and source 14. Those skilled in the art will realize that many other MIS configurations and devices may be fabricated using a pnictide rich insulating layer according to the present invention. Most III V semiconductor junction devices have either a planar or mesa configuration where the edges of the junction of junctions are exposed on the device surface. For same critical applications, e.g. PIN or avalanche photodetector diodes for lightwave communicotions, it is imperative that the dark current, i.e. current with no illumination, under operating reverse bais be as low as possible in order to ensure low device noise. Since the surface current component of this dark current may be significant, it is desirable to minimize the surface current by passivation of the surface, i.e. reduction or elimination of surface current paths. This may be done by depositing a thin film of a suitable insulating material onto the exposed device surface. Materials currently used for this on III V devices include SiO2,Si3N4, polyimide and photoresist, but none are able controllably and reproducibly to reduce the surface current to the very low values needed. According to the present invention, there is used a thin film of polypnictide material, e.g. phosphorus, MP15 or MP wherein x is 15 or greater and M represents x an alkali metal, such as potassium, for III V devices of this type. These materials have 1 good physical and chemical stability 2 high electrical resistivity and 3 a preferred tendency or affinity for the polypnictides to grow on III V material substrates. Now, referring to accompanying illustrativeFigure 12, a body of III V semiconductor material 46 containing various layers has metal contacts 48 and 50 deposited thereon. To reduce the surface current component which would provide leakage between the layers 52, 54 and 56, a film 58 of pnictide is deposited according to the present invention. The device illustrated in Figure 12 may be, for example, a P I N photo detecting diode or an avalanche diode. The devices illustrated in Figure 12 has a planar structure. A device having a mesa structure is illustrated in accompanying Figure 13. It comprises various layers 58, 60, 62, 64, 66 and 68 of III V material and metal contacts 70 and 72. Again, in order to prevent surface currents across the interfaces 74, 76, 78, 80 and 82 between the layers 58, 60, 62, 64, 66 and 68, there are provided pnictide rich passivating layers 84 and 86. The device illustrated in Figure 13 may be, for example a photo detecting P I N diode or an avalanche diode. Both Figures 12 and 13 illustrate the use of the present pnictide layers to lower surface currents in optbelectronic devices. Another important application of the present invention to opto electronic devices is based on the fact that the present pnictide layers reduce the surface recombination velocity at the surfaces of III V semiconductors to which they are applied. An increase by a factor of 2.5 in the measured photoluminescence intensity of heavily doped GaAs with an amorphous thin film of layer like puckered sheet like phosphorus grown on the 111 surface has been noted. This increase in the photoluminescence intensity indicates a decrease recombination velocity at the surface. It is known that the smaller the surface recombination velocity the better the performance of the opto electronic devices, such as light emitting diodes, lasers, solar cells, photo cathodes and photo detectors utilizing III V semiconductors. According to the present invention, the layer of the present layer like form of pnictide rich material would be applied to the light emitting or lightcollecting surface of the opto electronic device. Thus, referring accompanying illustrativeFigure 14, a light collecting device according to the present invention comprises a body 88 of a compound intermetallic or III V semiconductor comprising a pnictide and a pnictide rich layer 90 deposited on the light collecting surface 92 thereof. Similarly, as illustrated in accompanyingFigure 15, a light emitting device according to the present invention again comprises a body 94 of a compound intermetallic semiconductor comprising a pnictide rich layer 96 deposited on the light emitting surface 98 thereof. If the light collecting or light emitting device has two or more semiconductor layers which emerge on the surfaces 92 or 98, respectively, as indicated by the intersections between them 100 and 102, respectively, then the layers 90 and 96, respectively, also reduce surface currents. The layers 90 and 96 may also be used to reduce surface currents between contacts, not shown, as in the devices illustrated in accompanying Figures9 to 13. Thus, there has been disclosed the insulation and passivotion of compound and intermetallic semiconductors comprising a pnictide, particularly III V semiconductors and a new form of pnictide rich thin films having a layer like, puckered sheet like local order it has been shown that such layers, when deposited on pnictide based semiconductors, reduce the density of surface states, allow modulation of the depletion layer, decrease the surface barrier, increase the carrier concentration at the surface, increase the photoluminescence and decrease the carrier recombination velocity at the surface there have been disclosed MIS ond Schottky devices, particularly MISFETS AND MESFETS, utilizing pnictiderich layers for insulation and passivation and various electro optical devices utilizing such layers for insulation, passivation, increased performance and lifetime. The semiconductors utilized in the present invention comprising pnictides are commonly call intermetullic or compound. III V semiconductors which are compound, intermetallic semiconductors may comprise elements fromGroup III and Group V of the periodic Table, such as the binary semiconductor aluminium phosphide, aluminium arsenide, aluminium antimonide, gallium phosphide, gallium arsenide, gallium antimonide, indium phosphide, indium arsenide and indium antimonide, the ternary and the quaternary semiconductors. By pnictide is meant those elements from Group V of the Periodic Table, namely nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony and bismuth.
