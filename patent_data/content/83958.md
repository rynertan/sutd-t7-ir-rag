# Method and apparatus for single frame recording on video tape.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for frame by frame record ing of an RF signal on a magnetic tape uses a video tape recorder VTR having a dynamic tracking head. While the tape is stopped, the tracking control voltage generated by the VTR during the playback of a prerecorded tape segment is stored. The tape is then moved to the desired location and stopped. The stored tracking control voltage is then applied to the dynamic tracking head during the recording of a new set of RF signals representative of a video frame.
