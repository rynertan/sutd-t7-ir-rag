# SOLVENT EXTRACTION OF ALCOHOLS FROM WATER SOLUTIONS WITH FLUOROCARBON SOLVENTS

## Abstract
Certain fluorocarbon liquid materials are particularly effective solvents for the removal of lower alcohols from aqueous solutions, an extraction process. The fluorocarbons have low heats of vaporization. The specific fluorocarbons recited have boiling points near room temperature which permits the separation of alcohols from the aqueous solu tions with much lower energy requirements than required by distillation. The solvent systems are intended for use in far mentation separations such as those recited in my co pending application Ser. No. 06 076 250 and similar anaerobic and aerobic fermentations to produce alcohols and related fermentation products.
