## Description
Water based pesticidal suspension and process for its manufacture This invention relates to a water based pesticidal suspension and to a process for the manufacture of this suspension. Although pesticides in the form of emulsifiable concentrates are preferred by the user because they are easy to handle, measure and mix under field conditions they suffer from the disadvantage of being based on an organic, normally aromatic, solvent system and thus attract criticism on toxicological and environmental grounds. This problem can be overcome by formulating the pesticide as a water based suspension commonly known as a suspension concentrate formulation which consists of finelydivided water insoluble normally solid pesticides suspended in water. Many pyrethroid insecticides are liquid or semi solid materials, and therefore not susceptible to formulation as a suspension concentrate. However, the Applicant has developed a water based suspension for pyrethroid insecticides which possesses all the advantages of conventional suspension concentrates and also possesses improved pesticidal properties. Accordingly, the present invention provides a water based pesticidal suspension comprising a a liquid or semi solid pyrethroid insecticide which is distributed over and or adsorbed upon a finely divided solid carrier in a weight ratio of carrier to pyrethroid insecti cide in the range 1 1 to 100 1 b water in which is suspended the carrier having the pyrethroid insecticide distributed thereover and or adsorbed thereon c a dispersing agent of the non ionic and or anionic type to disperse the finely divided solid carrier in the water, the dispersing agent being present in a concentration range of 5 to 200 grammes per litre of the suspension and d a structuring agent in a concentration range of 0.1 to 30.0 grammes per litre of suspension to stabilise the suspension and substantially prevent settling out of the finely divided carrier and wherein the pyrethroid insecticide is present in a concentration of 1 to 250 grammes per litre of suspension. The liquid or semi solid pyrethroid insecticide is preferably a 3 phenoxybenzyl ester, an alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl ester, an alpha cyano 2 phenoxypyridin 6 ylmethyl ester, or an alpha cyano3 4 halophenoxy benzyl ester of a substituted cyclopropane acid, a substituted phenylacetic acid or a substituted phenylaminoacetic acid, for example a 3 phenoxybenzyl 2 2,2 dichlorovinyl 3,3 dimethylcyclo propanecarboxylate b alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 2 2,2 dichlorovinyl 3,3 dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylat e tc alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 2 2,2 dibromovinyl 3,3 di methylcyclopropanecarboxylate d alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 2,2,3,3 tetramethylcyclopropane carboxylate e alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alpha isopropyl 4 chlorophenyl acetate f alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alpha isopropyl 4 difluoro methoxyphenyl acetate g alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl spiro 2 1 indene 3,3 dimethyl cyclopropanec arboxylate h alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alphE 2 chloro 4 trifluoro methylphenylamino alpha isopropyl acetate i alpha cyano 2 phenoxypyridin 2 ylmethyl 2 2,2 dichlorovinyl 3,3 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate j alpha cyano 3 4 flurophenoxy benzyl 2 2,2 dichlorovinyl 3,3 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate k alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 2 1,2 dibromo 2,2 dichloroethyl 3,3 dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate 1 alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 2 2 trifluoroethyl 2 chlorovinyl 3,3 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate. The pyrethroids listed above possess asymmetric carbon atoms and thus exist in a number of stereosiomeric forms. The present invention is concerned with the formulation of those pyrethroids including those single isomers, or isomer mixtures which are liquids or semi solids at ambient temperatures. Thus the preferred pyrethroids, pyrethroid isomers, or pyrethroid isomer mixtures have a melting point below 800C suitably below 700C. The weight ratio of carrier to pyrethroid insecticide preferably lies in the range 1 1 to 50 1 more preferably in the range 1 1 to 20 1. The finely divided carrier can be any conventional carrier used in pesticidal formulations on to which or over which the pyrethroid insecticide can be adsorbed or distributed, for example a clay of the montmorillonite, kaolinite, attapulgite, bentonite or talc groups, diatomaceous earths, or calcium carbonate. The volume median diameter of the carrier in the suspension is preferably in the range 0.5 to 25 micrometers, more preferably in the range 1 to 10 micrometers for example 2 to 3 micrometers. The dispersing agent may be one or a combination of the following surfactants A the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts of sulphuric acid esters or sulphonic acids, preferably containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule. Thus for example long chain alkyl sulphates such as sodium lauryl sulphate or aliphatic or aromatic sulphonates such as sulphonated castor oil or various alkyl aryl sulphonates especially the sodium salts of alkyl aryl sulphonates having at least 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl group such as for example sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate, Sipex N.S.L., Tensiofix K.L. and Empicol L.Z. Calcium or sodium salts of lignin sulphonic acid, e.g. VANISPERSE L.B. are other examples. B polyalkylene oxide polymers, e.g. the Pluronics , high molecular weight alkyl polyglycol ethers or analogous thio ethers such as decyl, dodecyl, and tetradecyl polyglycol ethers and thioethers containing from 25 75 carbon atoms. C Condensation products of polyalkylene oxides with i aromatic nuclei e.g. alkyl phenols , such as Triton X 100, Nonidet P.40 ii long chain aliphatic alcohols, e.g. Nonidet A 10 and Nonidet A 50 iii castor oil and similar natural products, e.g. Tensiofia D120 and Atlas G 1285. D polymethacrylates e.g. Orotan 731. E a sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde copolymer, e.g. Stepantan A. F phosphate esters, e.g. GAFAC. The dispersing agent employed in any one formulation may consist of more than one surfactant and often two surfactants are employed in order to achieve optimum results. The dispersing agent is preferably present at a concentration in the range 10 to 50 grammes per litre of suspension. The structuring agent for stabilising the suspension and substantially preventing settling out of the finely divided carrier is preferably a polysaccharide e.g. Rhodopol or Kalzan, an aliginate e.g. Manucol, a cellulose derivative e.g. Natrosol, a carbohydrate gum e.g. gum arabic, or a soluble polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol. Clays such as bentonites and silicates may also be used. Preferably the structuring agent is a water soluble polymeric material which forms a network in which the finely divided carrier is entrained, a network which must be weak enough to break under the effect of pouring or shaking so that the formulation can be handled quite readily and capable of reforming to prevent the carrier particles settling on standing. The structuring agent is preferably present in a concentration of 1 to 10 grammes per litre of suspension. It has been observed that, although it is not essential, it is generally preferable to bring the pH of the suspension to a value in the range pH3 to pH7 generally speaking pH s of about 4 provide the best results. In commercial formulations the following additional ingredients may also be added. i Anti freeze Agent In cold climates freezing of the suspension will in most cases destroy the suspension and thus destroy the efficacy of the pesticidal action. Anti freeze agents such as monoethylene glycol or urea may therefore be added to improve the shelf life of the suspension. ii Bactericide If organic material is present in the suspension then in order to prevent bacterial degradation a bactericide is necessary, for example formaldehyde. iii Defoamer According to the surfactants employed in the suspension and to its method of manufacture the degree of foaming may be sufficiently great to cause problems in packaging and dilution. Thus defoamers such as silicones, solvents and esters may be employed to minimise foaming. The water based suspension according to the invention differs from conventional suspension concentrates by virtue of its ability to suspend in water liquid or semi solid pesticides and, as has been explained above, this is achieved by adsorbing and or distributing the pesticide onto a carrier and then suspending in water the carrier bearing the pesticide.The present invention therefore also relates to a process for the manufacture of a water based pesticidal suspension which comprises a homogenising the pyrethroid insecticide with an emulsifying agent where the weight ratio of insecticide to emulsifying agent is in the range 1 1 to 10 1, preferably in the range 1 1 to 5 1 b forming a slurry of the homogenised mixture of the pyrethroid insecticide and the emulsifying agent together with the carrier, water and the dispersing agent and c forming a structured suspension by adding to the slurry a structuring agent. The emulsifying agent used in the first step of the process may be any one of the surfactants employed as the dispersing agent but is preferably a surfactant listed under paragraph C above and is suitably a condensation product of an alkylene oxide and an alkyl phenol. Homogenisation can be achieved by a stirring or agitational action, for example in a suitable feed vessel provided with stirring or agitational facilities. The carrier may be in the finely divided form required by the suspension according to the invention but is preferably added in its natural state and the required particle size obtained by wet milling the slurry obtained from the second step before the structuring agent is added. Thus according to a preferred aspect of the invention the water based pesticidal suspension is manufactured by a process which comprises a homogenising the pyrethroid insecticide with an emulsifying agent where the weight ratio of insecticide to emulsifying agent is in the range 1 1 to 10 1, preferably in the range 1 1 to 5 1 b forming a slurry of the homogenised mixture of the pyrethroid insecticide and the emulsifying agent together with the carrier, water and the dispersing agent c wet milling the slurry to produce a suspension of the required particle size and d forming a structured suspension by adding to the wet milled slurry a structuring agent. The wet milling of the slurry may be carried out in a wetgrinding mill, for example a perl mill, a ball mill or a glassbead mill. Milling times will depend on the initial particle size of the carrier, the volume of the formulation being milled and the capacity of the particular milling apparatus employed.The temperature of the milling stage should not be allowed to rise too high and in general should be kept below 600C, suitably below 400C. In general it is preferred to add the structuring agent to the milled slurry in the form of a solution in water together with, if desired, the anti freeze agent and the bactericide. Conveniently the milled slurry is lead to a mixing vessel into which is added the structuring agent solution and the combined contents stirred or agitated together to form the desired stabilised pesticidal suspension. If necessary a defoamer nay be added during the process according to the invention, suitably to the slurry or during its formation. The pesticidal suspension according to the invention has been found to be a very useful formulation in agrochemical practice and in the case of cypermethrin alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 2 2,2 dichlorovinyl 3 , 3 dimethylcyciopropanecarboxylate very good results have been achieved in that better insect control is obtainable than with conventional formulations of the emulsifiable concentrate or wettable powder type. The invention is further illustrated by the followingExamples.Example 1 A water based suspension containing the following ingredients in the indicated proportions was prepared.

The carrier was then added to the mixture and stirring continued for a further 15 minutes. The remainder of the defoamer was added and incorporated into the slurry. The slurry was then fed to a wet grinding mill maintained at a temperature below 400C and milling effected until the volume median diameter of the carrier was less than 3.0 micrometers. The anti freeze agent, the structuring agent, the bactericide and water 98.2 kg were fed to a second vessel provided with stirring facilities and stirred to produce a homogeneous gel phase. The milled slurry was fed to a final blending vessel provided with stirring facilities and the gel phase blended with it to form a stabilised pesticidal suspension. Example 2Tests on Activity of Pesticidal Suspension The method of testing was based on SABS South African Bureau of Standards Method 583 , whereby cement and painted wood panels were sprayed to the point of run off with different formulations at various strengths. Flies Musca domestica were then exposed to the panels for a set period of time, then transferred to clean observation containers containing food, incubated and observed at set intervals. Four replicates were made for each strength tested and for the control insecticide as well as the untreated control. Re exposure tests were done in the same manner at 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and two months after treating the panels.When less than 75 mortality occurred the particular insecticide was discarded. The following formulations were tested at the strengths indicated, formulation B being the formulation according to the invention and formulations A and C being included for comparative purposes.Cypermethrin Formulations ApplicationA.
