# Adjustable length prosthetic joint implant.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a surgically implantable prosthetic joint implant adapted for length adjustment after initial surgery to compensate, for example, for growth of a juvenile patient. A stem 11 for bone implantation has a flange 12 for overlying the bone end and a threaded portion 13 for adjusting axially with respect to an overlying sleeve 14 which carries at its extremity an articulating component 16 of the joint. A pin in the sleeve 18 and elongated slot 19 in the stem restrain relative rotation but allow axial relative movement as the stem is urged into or out of the sleeve by rotation of a nut 21 coacting with the threads on the stem while being axially restrained by the sleeve. The nut is described as having a ring of gear teeth 26 to be actuated by an insertable gear carrying key 27 . An alternative embodiment uses an accessible recessed bolt 37 for moving the stem into or out of the sleeve.
