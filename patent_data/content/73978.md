# Antithrombogenic materials.

## Abstract
An antithrombogenic material is composed of a fluorine containing block polymer obtained by the polyaddition or polycondensation of a prepolymer with a chain extender, said prepolymer being a diisocyanate prepolymer repre sented by the formula OCN CH₂RfCH₂NHCOO A CONH CH₂RfCH₂NCO I where Rf is a perfluoroalkylene or perfluoroxyalkylene group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and containing from 0 to 10 ether linkages, A is a divalent organic group containing an oxygen atom in its main chain and m is from 1 to 3, or a dicarbamate prepolymer obtained by reacting the diisocyanate prepolymer with a lower alcohol.
