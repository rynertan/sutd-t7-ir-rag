# Improvements in or relating to semi conductor lasers.

## Abstract
In a semi conductor laser of the buried active laser layer type, the laser layer is located between a layer of n type material and a layer of p type material, the sides of the active laser layer and at least a portion of the n type layer and the p type layer being covered with a plurality of thin layers with a doping sequence such that a large number of p n junctions are included in the plurality of thin layers.
