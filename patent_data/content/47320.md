# LINEARIZING CIRCUIT AND ELECTRONIC TIME PIECE USING THE SAME.

## Abstract
A linearizing circuit which includes a frequency mixer circuit for mixing at a prescribed ratio, a first frequency varying in response to the variation of a parameter with a second frequency from a reference oscillation source which is independent of the parameter, and an arithmetic circuit for producing an output pulse corresponding to the average period of the output obtained from the mixer circuit, there by linearizing the parameter output characteristics. This linearizing circuit is installed in an electronic time piece as ambient temperature sensing means, which means senses temperature information to correct a clock signal in ac cordance with a temperature shift with respect to a refer ence temperature, thereby to compensate for the temper ature change.
