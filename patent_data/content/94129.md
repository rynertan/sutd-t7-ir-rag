# Semiconductor devices comprising unipolar hot carrier transistors and methods of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
Semiconductor devices comprising one or more gate controlled unipolar hot carrier transistors are disclosed having a semiconductor barrier region 3 located between laterally separated first and second region portions 1,2a of one conductivity type. The barrier region 3 has a net doping concentration of the opposite conductivity type and is sufficiently thin that the depletion layers formed at zero bias with both the first and second regions 1, 2 merge to gether substantially to deplete said barrier region 3 of mo bile charge carriers. Current flow 12 between the first and second regions 1,2 is at least partially by thermionic emis sion of charge carriers of said one conductivity type across the barrier region 3 at a major surface 11 of the body 10 . The transistor has a gate 15 in the vicinity of the barrier region 3 and capacitively coupled thereto for example via dielectric layer 18 so as to permit the thermionic emission current 12 to be controlled by applying a voltage V
