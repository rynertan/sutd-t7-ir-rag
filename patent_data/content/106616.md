# Road vehicle headlamp.

## Abstract
A high aspect ratio passing beam headlamp has a body 32 provided with front opening 34 and a rear opening 46 which is displaced below the horizontal median line of the headlamp. Within the body 32 is a pair of lateral curved reflective portions 60 and 62 separated by an upper curved reflective portion 64. The foci of the reflective portions 60, 62 and 64 are coincident. A bulb 50 is mounted in the rear opening 46. A U shaped bulb filament shield 48 rests against a lower planar portion 44 of the body 32 and has arms which provide a horizontal cut off on both sides of the bulb 50. The lateral curved reflective portions 60 and 62 have their optical axes mutually inclined in both the horizontal and vertical directions such that the beam pattern projected by the reflector from the shielded filament has, at 25 metres from the headlamp, a lower beam portion having a horizontal upper cut off, an intermediate beam portion having an upwardly inclined cut off extending from one side of the upper off the lower beam portion, and an upper beam portion having a horizontal upper cut off extending from the inclined cut off on the opposite side thereof to the lower beam portion, the lower beam portion being provided by one of the curved reflective portions and the intermediate and upper beam portions being provided by the other of the curved reflective portions.
