That is it uses 1 500 wt.parts of . orium salt as against 100 wt. parts of phenolic resin.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVNTT0N The present invention relates to a developer sheet for carbonless reproduction paper, further detailedly to a developer sheet which features the following. That is that it uses phenolic resin or phenolic resin with activated clay.as developer, characterised in that an ammonium salt is present in it. So called carbonless paper has been publicly known and as described for example in the U.S.Patent Specification Nos. 2 712 507, 2 730 465 and 2 730 457 it utilizes both microcapsules containing a solution in an organic solvent of a colorless organic compound hereinafter referred to as coupler having electron donating adsorbable coloring reactive property and an electron accepting reactive adsorbing substance hereinafter referred to as developer .Hitherto, microcapsules have been znufactured through various methods for example, such as the coacervatlon method, the interfacial polymerization method, the in situ method and so on, and as coupler zelachite green lactone, crystal violet lactone, benzoyl leuco methylene blue, rhodanine B lctuc, 3 dialkyl amino 7 dialkyl vinyl fluorane, 3 methyl 2, 2 spiropy benzo f chromen and so on, has been used.Further, as the aforementioned developer inorganic developers such as activated clay, acid clay, attapulguite, zeolite, bentonite and the like, and organic compounds for example phenolic resin such as para tertiary butyl phenolic resin, paraphenyl phenolic resin and so on or succinic acid, tannic acid, italic acid, maleic acid, gallic acid and the like, further aromatic carboxylic acid such as benzoic acid, salicylic acid, substituted salicylic acid, naphthoeic acid, diphenic acid and so on or metallic acids of these have been well known among those concerned.Such a developer sheet that uses phenolic resin out of these developers is so constructed that it shows good coupling property and excellent color fastness of coupled characters, and generally it has been widely used, but it has such defects in that it shows deteriorated yellowing property and weather resistance particularly, yellowing property due to ultraviolet ray irradiation of white part of developer sheet due to adsorption of nitrogen oxidant not in the atmospheric air.Further, in recent years, as described in the PatentPublication o. SHO 50 17888 Japan combined use of phenolic resin and solid acid has come to be prevalent, but in this case further such a defect that it is likely to turn out yellowing has become outstanding and the need for improvement has been urgently studied. The object of the present invention is to provide such a developer sheet for carbonless reproduction paper, that is, to improve yellowing property due to adsorption of nitrogen oxidant present in the atosvreric acid and weather resistance, particularly yellowing property due to the effect of ultraviolet rays. In case of the former it takes effect corresponding to preserving resistance in a dark piace, v hile in case of the latter it corresponds to preserving resistance in a bright place so that both may be factors having significant meaning for co erci21 value of paper. The inventors of the present invention have found that the aforementioned object can be attained by adding ammonium salt of acid into the system using at least phenolic resin as developer.Particularly remarkable effects can be observe in case of a system combinedly using phenolic resin and solic acid, especially activated clay. What ie called ammonium salt of acid that can be used for the present invention includes for example, organic acid ammonium salts such as ammonium acetate, ammonium alginate, n nmmonium butyrate, ammonium oxalate, ammonium dicitrate, ammonium tricitrate, ammonium ditartrate, ammonium succinate, ammonium lactate, ammonium adipate, ammonium sebacinate, ammonium phthalate, ammonium benzoate and so on and inorganic acid ammonium salts such as ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, a onium nitrate, ammonium carbonate, aininonium thiosulfate, ammonium hydrogen sulfate, ammonium persulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium diphosphate, ammonium triphosphate and so on.These can be singularly or combinedly used, and among these as particularly favorable examples ammonium phthalate, ammonium citrate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate and ammonium chloride can be cited. The amount of ammonium salts of these acids is 1 300 wt. parts as against 100 wt. parts of phenolic resin, especially favorable 30 120 wt. parts. In case of using below 1 prt of the above compound sufficient effect may not be raised, and even in case of more than 300 parts remarkable effect may not be shown, and in addition there are some cases where it tends to impair liquid property and coupling property. However, in this case method of adding these ammonium salts of acids is not particularly restricted.Phenolic resins that can be used for the present invention include paraphenyl phenolic resin, parz tertiary butyl phenolic resin, pera octyl phenolic resin, parachlor phenolic resin, paracumyl phenolic resin, metal salts of these Zu, Ihg etc and so on, but from the viewpoint of coupling property and color fading property of coupled characters it is particularly desirable to use para phenyl phenolic resin. moreover, activated clay that can be used in the system where it is used with phenolic resin is so constructed that acid clay or similar clays are treated with mineral acid se that alumina, iron and any other basic component soluble in acid may be deposited until its surface area shows more than 200m2 g, but in this case it little matters whether metal salts of zinc, manesimD and so on are mixed in it. As binder used for the present invention starch, dextrine, casein, gum arabic, styrene butadiene latex, butadlene acrylnitrile latex, vinyl acetate latex, polyvinyl alcohol and the like can be used without being particularly restricted. As material for it the suitable amount of inorganic pigments such as calcium carbonate, zinc oxide, kaolin, clay and so on ana organic pigments such as ureaformalin resin Xicropo er and so on is used. Together with the aforementioned pigment, binder and so on phenolic resin and acid ammonium salt are used so that coating liquid may be prepared, and then coating liquid is coated on base material such as paper in such a way that developer sheet can be obtained. further, after developer sheet is produced through any ordinary method by overcoatlng acid ammonia salt on it the same effect as described above can be obtained. Kicrocapsules containing coupler can be manufactured for example according to the U.S. Patent SpecificationNo. 2 800 457, and its concrete example will be concretely described as follows. After microcapsules containing coupler are dissolved in 100 wt. parts hereinafter the term Part referred to as weight part in which 2 parts of crystal violet lactone and 1 part of benzoyl leuco methylene blue are dissolved, solution thus obtained is emulsified in 160 parts of acid treated gelatine isoelectric point 7.8 10 aqueous solution.

Coupler sheet is obtained through the following method.50 parts of 10 starch oxide aqueous solution and 30 parts of wheat starch granules are added into 100 parts solid content of microcapsules containing coupler and then coated on quality paper of 40 g by means of air knife coater so that the coating amount may indicate 5 g m2 solid content .
