In this related patent application, novel reaction sintered ceramic bodies, and methods of forming same, are disclosed which are prepared by reaction sintering fine grain homogenous intimate interdispersions of selected boride and oxide phases. Such oxide boride ceramic bodies are of the type physically formed of ingredients corresponding to the crystalline phases in the ceramic bodies. For example, U.S. Patent 2,27O,6O7 discloses mixing, shaping and sintering at least 1O weight of oxides of Al, Zr, Be and or Th with borides of W, Fe and the like, to yield ceramic bodies of those same phases.

Such ceramic bodies include the type physically formed of ingredients corresponding to the crystalline phases in the ceramic bodies. For example, U.S. Patent 3,1O8,887 discloses hot pressed particulate mixtures of AlN with other compounds, among which are mentioned the compounds MX where M is different from X and is selected from aluminum, boron, silicon, rare earth metals, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, thorium, vanadium, columbium niobium tantalum, protactinium, chromium, molybdenum and uranium although no example is given of any of these MX compounds . UK patent specification 954,272 discloses bodies either sintered or hot pressed, of particulate mixtures of AlN with a boride of titanium, zirconium, chromium or molybdenum U.S. Patents 3,251,7OO and 3,328,28O disclose hot pressed or sintered particulate mixtures of TiB₂ and AlN.

Typically, the aforementioned bodies, when composed even partially of carbides, nitrides or borides, are difficult to join to each other or to other materials such as metals or oxides, because they do not easily sinter and are easily oxidized. Further, many of these bodies are brittle, and, when joined to bodies of differing coefficients of thermal expansion, are subject to fracture during thermal stress. Even in those cases where joints of suitable mechanical integrity are achieved, the electrical characteristics of such joints may be undesirable. Numerous methods have been disclosed for joining various nitride, carbide, boride, silicide and or sulfide bodies. In Various bonding methods are also disclosed in the patent literature.

The process is a reaction pressing process which includes the steps of thoroughly mixing together elements or compounds capable of reacting to form one or more compounds of the intermetallic type and forming such compounds by subjecting the elements or compounds to conditions of heat and pressure to form such intermetallic type compounds. Compounds of the intermetallic type which are referred to include silicides, borides, aluminides, titanides, zirconides, antimonides, germanides and beryllides. There remains a continuing need for methods of joining solid carbide, boride, nitride, silicide or sulfide bodies to produce joined products exhibiting good mechanical, thermal and electrical properties, and which can facilitate the easy and economical fabrication of those bodies into a variety of shapes and sizes by heating at relatively low temperatures. It may be difficult, for example, to use any given fabrication procedure to form bodies which vary greatly in size and or volume. It may also be difficult using such procedures to form bodies having the desired complexity of shape. Accordingly, a need exists for a simple and economical joining method which will reduce or overcome such difficulties. It is an object of this invention to provide a method of joining solid carbide, boride, nitride, silicide or sulfide bodies, and the joined products of those methods, which substantially overcomes the aforesaid limitations of the prior art and enables the practical attainment of greater technical and economic ease in the flexibility of fabricating such bodies with specifically tailored and improved properties as noted herein. It is also an object of this invention to provide certain advantageous product features as detailed hereinafter. The invention is characterized by the discovery that certain difficult to join solid carbide, boride, nitride, silicide or sulfide bodies can be joined using an intermixture of selected precursors which are reacted exothermically to provide a strong, electrically continuous joint. The method of this invention comprises providing an intermixture of solid precursors capable of reacting exothermically, said precursors being selected to yield an exothermic reaction product selected from the group consisting of Preferably, the joining method of this invention is performed by disposing a layer of reactive mixture between precleaned opposing surfaces of the bodies to be joined. The, thus formed laminate is then subjected to a pressure of at least 35, preferably 140 142, kg cm², whereupon heating to no more than about 16OO C is performed, either in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere. In certain of the herein disclosed embodiments, hydrogen is released and removed from the laminate during this heating process, prior to the initiation of the exothermic reaction which forms the join. The present methods are particularly useful for bonding pieces of reaction hot pressed TiB₂ Al composites at relatively low temperatures. These methods utilize the large amounts of energy which are released when the highly stable boride is formed. In accordance with one preferred method, an intermixture of calcined TiH₂ and AlB₂ precursors is disposed between pieces of TiB₂ Al composite, the assembly is located into a hot press, pressure is applied, and the assembly is heated in vacuum. At about 1OOO C the Ti and AlB₂ react to form TiB₂ and Al. The temperature of the joint rises abruptly many hundreds of degrees and under the influence of the locally high temperature and pressure, a strong and electrically continuous bond is formed without raising the furnace temperature above about 1OOO C. Of course, reaction temperature is governed by the particular reactants and their identified reaction temperature at whatever pressure is selected for performing the heating step. Further objects and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following more detailed description. The present invention provides a novel method for joining solid carbide, boride, nitride, silicide, or sulfide bodies. In accordance with this invention, one of the bodies to be joined is a difficult to join boride, carbide, nitride, silicide or sulfide. In particular, this first body consists essentially of 5 to 1OO molar percent of first phase or phases selected from the group consisting of a boride, carbide, nitride, silicide or sulfide, or combinations thereof, of elements in groups 2a, 3a, 4a, 2b, 3b, including the lanthanide and actinides series, 4b, 5b, 6b, 7b and 8 and O 95 molar percent of second phase or phases of metal, alloy, intermetallic compound, oxide or mixtures thereof. This first solid body may be joined to a second solid body consisting essentially of material with phase or phases selected from the group consisting of boride, oxide, carbide, nitride, silicide, or sulfide, or combinations thereof, of elements in the groups 2a, 3a, 4a, 2b, 3b, including the lanthanide and actinide series, 4b, 5b, 6b, 7b, and 8, a metal, an alloy, and intermetallic material, or carbon, or combinations thereof. The aforementioned first and second solid bodies may be joined or bonded by providing an intermixture of precursors capable of reacting exothermically. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that such exothermic reactions may result in a reaction sintering of the subject precursors, and a resultant bonding of those precursors to adjacent materials as a result of a reaction which has a substantial negative heat of formation as its driving force. The products or bodies formed, therefore, must have a lowered free energy of formation than the reactants from which they were prepared. The elements of the groups of the Periodic Table as described herein, are selected for use as precursors so as to conform to these principles. In particular, such precursors are selected to yield an exothermic reaction product as described herein. More particularly, in the following listing of molar reactions, suitable precursors are listed on the left, and their resultant exothermic reaction products on the right except in the case of H₂ or O₂ which are removed as gases Once the intermediate laminate has been formed, the laminate should be heated in the absence of atmospheric reactants to heat sufficient to initiate an exothermic reaction which joins the solid body. This heating step may be performed in an inert atmosphere such as argon, or more preferably may be performed in a vacuum. Performance of the joining process in a vacuum is particularly desirable when oxygen or hydrogen gas is released from one of the precursors prior to or during the exothermic reaction. In choosing particulate reactants which are useful for joining the subject solid bodies, the physical and chemical compatibility between the resultant exothermic reaction product and those bodies should be considered. For example, a joining reaction which results in a free aluminum metal phase may not be compatible with an oxide which can be reduced by aluminum, a silicate. Some chemical reaction with the parts to be bonded is desirable, however, to form a strong bond. A particularly important physical consideration is the difference in thermal expansion between the first and second solid bodies to be joined, and between the joint material. Severe mismatches in thermal expansion may cause stresses that will fracture the joint. On the other hand, by judicious choice of a bonding reaction, an expansion mismatch between the solid bodies to be joined may be buffered. For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion of polycrystalline alpha alumina is about 80 X 1O ⁷ C over the range of 25 C to 1OOO C. The coefficient for polycrystalline TiB₂ for the range of 25 C to 1OOO C is 90 X 1O ⁷ C. A particularly good joining reaction for solid bodies composed of the aforementioned materials would therefore be Generally, the particulate precursor reactants are mixed in accordance with the above identified molar formulas in stoichiometric proportions to form the desired exothermic reaction products. However, non stoichiometric proportions may be used in order to vary the properties of the joint or to control the reaction process. Powdered diluent material may also be added during the formation of either of the bodies to be joined, or to the precursors which result in the joint itself. The diluent may be or contain one of the elements of the reactants or may be the same as one of the reaction produced phases in the products, or may be other suitable material, any of which may be used to control the reaction sintering or properties of the resultant product. The amount of diluent or diluents must be less than the amount which would interfere in the achievement of a suitable bond between the first and second bodies. The precursors can be mixed or blended in any suitable manner known to those skilled in ceramic technology for yielding an intimate, homogenous mixture of reactant particles, e.g. by ball milling in dry or wet condition. For very dense joint or bond, a high pressure pressing procedure, including hot isotactic pressing, may be employed. The mixed precursor reactants may be charged into a mold, and, if desired, may be given pretreatment such as dehydration, degassing or burn out of binder, provided the pretreatment temperature is kept below the temperature which initiates the exothermic reaction. It is advantageous to precompact the precursor reactant mixture at room temperature and at 5O 1OO hot pressing pressure to ensure a uniform compacted layer of precursor reactants which may be easily interposed between adjacent surfaces of the solid bodies to be joined. The pressing step of the present invention may be preformed in a mold comprising, for example, an annular die with upper and lower plungers. The mold can be of any material not adversely reactive with the solid parts to be joined and with the precursor reaction mixture, and that can withstand pressures up to 15,OOO psi about 1O55 kg cm² or more. Graphite molds have been found very suitable for pressures up to 1O,OOO psi about 7OO kg cm² . Preferably, the pressing step of the present invention is initiated prior to beginning heating to initiate the exothermic joining reaction. A moderate vacuum eg about 1 X 1O ⁴ TORR is satisfactory for making the joints of the present invention. However, as mentioned above, an inert gas atmosphere may be employed for the same purpose of protecting the reactants and the mold from adverse air oxydation. As necessary, pressing should be increased to full load during heating, or at the maximum hot pressing temperature. To assure a good join, full pressure should be at least 2,OOO psi about 14O kg cm² . Heating can be done in any suitable hot pressing furnace, such as an induction heating furnace or electric resistance heating furnace used to make samples of the invention, which provides very rapid heat up. Heating rates satisfactorily employ ranges from about 30 per minute during the initial phase of heating to about 7 per minute as the exotherm initiation temperature is approached. Slower heating rates are preferably used with reactant mixtures evolving gas, such as hydrogen, which is drawn off by the vacuum system prior to initiation of the exotherm. Heating progresses to a temperature at which the reaction sintering is initiated and a suitable joint is formed. That event is marked by a rapid temperature rise in the mold due to exothermic heat evolution from the reaction. When the maximum temperature and pressure for the reaction hot pressing of the joint are attained, they are usually held for some short period to a short complete reaction sintering, the length of which is dependent upon the size and volume of the joint to be obtained. Thereafter, the molds containing the samples are cooled in the furnace under protective atmosphere and the pressure is held on the samples until they are cooled to a suitable solidification temperature. The molds are removed from the furnace and the samples are then pressed out of the mold body. The preferred method of the present invention relates to bonding together pieces of reaction hot pressed TiB₂ Al composite at relatively low temperature. This method utilizes the large amount of energy which is released when the highly stable boride is formed. Specifically, the method comprises sandwiching between the bodies to bonded, a powder of the precursor TiH₂ plus AlB₂ to form a laminated assembly. This assembly is loaded into a hot press, pressure is applied and the assembly is heated in a vacuum. As the furnace warms, the TiH₂ decomposes and H₂ gas is pumped away, in accordance with the following molar formula A second less preferred class of reactions are those which give off gases during the joining reaction. An example of such a reaction is as follows The present invention is also particularly useful for joining a first body portion consisting essentially of polycrystalline TiB₂, and a second metallic body portion, such as a steel body portion, wherein the exothermic reaction product consists essentially of a boride, carbide, nitride or silicide of Ti, Al, Ni, or Fe, or a combination thereof. The borides of those compounds being preferred . A further advantageous embodiment involves the joining of a polycrystalline TiB₂ first body to a silicon nitride second body with an exothermic reaction product joint consisting essentially of a silicide, boride, nitride or carbide of Ti, Si or B, or mixtures thereof. The present invention may be further understood by reference to the following examples. Two four inch 10.16cm diameter by one inch 2.54 cms thick disks of a reaction hot pressed TiB₂ Al composite were joined using the joint reactants of the equations 1 and 2 above. The TiH₂ and AlB₂ mixture was calcined to 65O C to remove the hydrogen. The two pieces to be joined were identical and the joining reaction yielded a joint material which was chemically identical to the two pieces being joined. The faces of the two pieces to be joined were sandblasted and ground flat with a SiC abrasive. The faces were ultrasonically cleaned in alcohol and the pieces were carefully dried. A layer of reactant powder 1 8 O.317 cm thick was sandwiched between the two pieces in a carbon mold. The reactant powder was a mixture of 1 1 molar ratio of TiH₂ and AlB₂ which has been calcined at 65O C to remove the hydrogen. The mold was placed in a hot press. The press cavity was evacuated and 6,OOO psi 41.4 Bar pressure was applied to the sandwich assembly. The temperature was raised at a rate of 30 per minute to 5OO C and at 7 per minute to the exotherm initiation temperature. The exothermic reaction occurred at about 11OO C after which the assembly was allowed to cool. The pressure was removed after the assembly had cooled to a temperature below the freezing point of aluminum. This procedure yielded a well bonded assembly that was strong and electrically continuous. Bars of the material that contained the joint were broken in a bending test, and of the six samples tested none broke at the joint. Measurements of electrical resistivity at room temperature and at 1OOO C indicate excellent electrical continuity across the joints. Samples with a join showed an average resistivity micro ohm centimeter of 14 at 25 C and 78 at 1OOO C. This compared favorably to sample without a joint, which exhibited a resistivity of 10 at 25 C and 62 at 1OOO C. A four inch 1O.16 cm diameter by one inch 2.54 cm thick of reaction hot pressed TiB₂ Al composite was bonded to a one quarter inch O.63 cm thick, 4 inch 10.16 cm diameter disk of the reaction hot pressed composite TiB₂ AlN. The reactant powder and the procedure was identical to that in Example 1. The two pieces were firmly bonded together. They have been placed in a corrosive environment of cryolite, aluminum and carbon at 1OOO C in an electric field, and after three months the bond is still good. This example demonstrates the suitability of this invention for producing well bonded products composed of dissimilar boride composition. The method and products of this invention are quite useful in a variety of applications. For example, by joining short segments of TiB₂ Al composite materials a long rod may be formed for use as an electric current collector in Hall Heroult cell.
