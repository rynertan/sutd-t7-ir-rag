# Pumping apparatus.

## Abstract
A pump and heat exchanger for pumping an electrically conductive fluid by interaction with a magnetic field and a flowing second electrically conductive fluid wherein a plural ity of tubes 38, 40 are arranged within a circular annulus formed between concentric shells 30, 32 . One of the fluids is pumped by conventional means 18 through the radial spaces between the tubes 38, 40 , generating currents and voltages which cause the other fluid to flow within the tubes 38, 40 and in the opposite direction. In magnetic air gap regions 44, 46 of the pump, the tubes are rectangular in shape. As a result of the circular geometry, currents flow circumferentially within the annulus and voltages are main tained at a low value while the fluid is propelled through the tubes 38, 40 without a mechanical drive pump.
