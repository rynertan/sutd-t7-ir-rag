# Device and method for centrifugally casting articles on a continuous basis.

## Abstract
A centrifugal casting device and method employing a rotatable polymerization column 2 adapted to accommo date a plurality of vertically aligned molds 10 and being associated with an arrangement of advancing means and mold feeding means which are synchronized to intermittent ly and automatically advance a mold 10 containing a polymerizable or curable composition in the mold cavity over the polymerization column 2 and then automatically force feeding said mold 10 into the polymerization column 2 .
