# Instrumental error compensation circuit for flow meter.

## Abstract
An instrumental error compensation circuit for a flow meter is disclosed in which a flow rate calculated from an output signal of the flow meter is identified with respect to a plurality of predetermined sections of flow rates. Flow rate compensation coefficients are calculated by linear interpola tion on the basis of actually measured data which are obtained in advance in accordance with instrumental errors of the flow meter. Actual flow rates of a fluid are measured with the instrumental errors of the flow meter compensated for by the calculated coefficients.
