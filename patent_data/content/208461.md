# An internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An IC engine has coolant distribution and discharge man ifolds adjacent each other on one side of the cylinder block 10 . Coolant enters the distribution manifold at a point inter mediate the ends of the line of cylinders and from there flows freely up into the cylinder head through cast openings 52 . The majority of coolant flows across the cylinder head and down to coolant chambers 58 surrounding the cylinder liners 20 via respective pairs of orificed holes 70 and 72 which control the flow of coolant around the cylinders and are provided in a head gasket 44 . Coolant is discharged from the coolant chambers 58 to the discharge manifold. In order to prevent creation of an air pocket at the top of the discharge side of the coolant chambers 58 , a portion of the coolant entering the head is routed directly, via a small opening 76 and 80 , to the coolant chambers 58 . To ensure that this coolant flow is distributed around the top of each cylinder liner 20 , a deflector ledge 84 is situated directly below this coolant opening 80 .
