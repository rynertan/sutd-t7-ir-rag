# CHARACTER DISPLAY PANELS AND PANEL DEVICES

## Abstract
A multi character multi segment electrically address able display panel. Character segments a to h are defined at each of a number of adjacent locations by the overlap of two sets of electrodes Fig. 6 Fig. 7 . The electrodes of one set Fig. 7 are each associated with a location and a group of one or more segments a, b, g c, e d, f h . The electrodes of the other set Fig. 6 extend across each location and are associated with no more than one segment in each segment group a b, e, f c, d, g . The panel is addressed using isogonal signals eg pseudo random bi nary sequence coded signals. The panel medium may be of dyed or undyed cholesteric to nematic phase change effect liquid crystal material, of low threshold or wide temperature range liquid crystal material.
