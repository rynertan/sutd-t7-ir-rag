# Boron and nitrogen containing compositions and their use in polycarbonate and polyester polycarbonate synthesis.

## Abstract
Boron and nitrogen containing compositions prepared by the reaction of a quaternary ammonium hydroxide with a tri alkyl or triaryl borate are useful for the preparation of the active catalyst species in the transesterification of reaction for the production of poly carbonates or polyester polycarbonates from diaryl carbonates optionally in admixture with diaryl di carboxylates and dihydroxyaromatic compounds.
