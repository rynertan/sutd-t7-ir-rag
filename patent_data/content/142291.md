# Process for separation of zirconium from hafnium.

## Abstract
Process for the separation of zirconium values from haf nium values wherein a solution of a zirconium chelate com plex and a hafnium chelate complex, each having a common ligand, is irradiated with light, of a wavelength from 300 nm to 700 nm, in the presence of a scavenger, such that one of the metal chelate complexes is excited and reacts with the scavenger to form a reaction product that is separated from the solution while the other of the metal chelate complex remains stable and is retained in the solution.
