# Recovery of power from vaporization of liquefied natural gas.

## Abstract
Power is recovered from the vaporization of liquefied natural gas by warming and vaporizing the liquefied natural gas against a first multicomponent stream which is cooled and liquefied. The liquefied multicomponent stream is pumped to an elevated pressure and is warmed and vaporized against a second multicomponent stream which is cooled and liquefied. The warmed first multicomponent stream is heated, expanded through a generator loaded expander and recycled. The liquefied second multicompo nent stream is pumped to an elevated pressure, heated, vaporized and expanded through a second generator loaded expander and recycled.
