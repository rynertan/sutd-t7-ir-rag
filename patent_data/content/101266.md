# PRINTING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A printing system incorporates a re usable image carrying printing surface. A material which forms a thin hydrophobic layer is arranged by various techniques over a substantially hydrophilic printing surface in a configuration which defines the desired latent image in terms of exposed, contiguous hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas. Depending upon the configuration of the layers, either an aqueous or oleo ink may be used to develop and print an image. If desired, the layer configuration may be replaced by a different configuration without substantial interruption to the printing process. No photo induced chemical reaction or latent image developing steps are required at any time. In a typical apparatus, the hydrophilic surface of a printing roll 10 is cleaned 12 16 and coated with a hydrophobic material 20 24 , and the hydrophobic material is physically removed from selected areas by a computer addressable spark discharge 26 30 , laser or other device to form a latent image. A fountain liquid is subsequently applied 40 , followed by an ink 50 , and the ink image is transferred to a substrate to be printed either directly 8 with the help of a pressure roll 6 or indirectly 6A through an offset roll 6 .
