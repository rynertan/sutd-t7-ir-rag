# Low pressure metal vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
A low pressure metal vapour discharge lamp having an outer glass envelope 1 defining a closed discharging space an inner glass tube 2 disposed within said envelope 1 and having an open end 2 and a closed end, a cathode 4 disposed within said tube 2 and a plurality of anodes 5,5 disposed within said envelope 1 outside said tube 2 . In order to provide discharge distributed over most of the discharging space, the voltage causing discharge is provided simultaneously to both or all the anodes 5,5 . through a discharge current shunting device 10 . The discharge current is forcibly shunted to all anodes and a plurality of discharge plasmas are generated simultaneously. To prevent flicker, means e.g. notches 6,6 in the tube 2 , a partition member 1 ,14,15 or filler material 19 may be provided to fix the locations of the disclarge paths to stabilize the plasmas.
