# OPTICAL SCANNING MICROSCOPE

## Abstract
An optical scanning microscope utilises a Bragg cell 2 controlled by an input acoustic signal 12 to split a beam of light from a laser 4 into two beams 8, 10 which are focused onto a sample 16 , one 10 of the beams being scanned across the sample 16 at the frequency of the input acoustic signal 12 . The two beams 8, 10 are compared after reflection from the sample 16 , the phase shift of the scanned beam 10 relative to the other beam 8 represent ing surface variation on the sample 16 .
