# Fluid flow meter.

## Abstract
A fluid flow meter having a paddle wheel rotatably mounted in a cylindrical cavity and an inlet conduit and an outlet conduit tangentially aligned with the periphery of the cavity for directing a fluid to flow through it. The paddle wheels s axis of rotation is displaced from the cavity s cen terline, in the direction of the inlet conduit and substantially perpendicular to the flow of fluid entering the cavity, such that the flow meter operates effectively over an extended range of Reynolds numbers, spanning both turbulent and laminar flows.
