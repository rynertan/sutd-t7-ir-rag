# Adhesive for chlorine containing polymers and aromatic group containing polymers.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a thermoplastic adhesive comprising a modified polyolefin resin having a branch chain having at least one carbonyl group and at least one benzene nucleus in one side chain. This adhesive shows a strong bonding force to a chlorine containing polymer or an aromatic group containing polymer such as a polyester and is especially valuable for the production of a laminate of such a resin and a polyolefin. A blend or block copolymer comprising an olefin resin component that can contain a carboxyl group and a carbon to carbon chain resin component having a benzoic acid ester or cinnamic acid ester group in the side chain is especially excellent in the bonding characteristics, particularly the heat resistance adhesion.
