# Film processor.

## Abstract
Apparatus for processing individual rolls of self developing type transparency film. The apparatus includes a spool having a first post, to which the leaders of a length of photographically exposed film and a length of flexible sheet material are adapted to be attached, and a second post, to which only the leader of the film is to be attached. The spool is adapted to be rotated so as to wind upon the spool a laminate comprised of the film, the sheet material, and a layer of pro cessing liquid sandwiched therebetween for a period of time sufficient to form a visible image in the laminate. After forma tion of such image, the laminate is unwound from the spool and the film stripped from the sheet material as they are being rewound into their original containers. The posts are con structed such that the leader of the sheet material will auto matically become detached from the first post at the end of the unwinding of the laminate thereby allowing the sheet mater ial to be returned completely to its container while the second post maintains its attachment to the film leader. Thus, when the film leader is manually detached from the second post, it is available for withdrawing the processed film from its con tainer for subsequent cutting and mounting of the film s indi vidual frames.
