## Description
COLD SET PHENOLIC RESINS The present invention relates to cold set phenolic resins, i.e.resins which cure to solids at ambient temperatures. Most phenolic resins are cured by heating. However there is a demand for phenolic resins which can be cured at normal ambient temperature e.g. 15 300C. Such cold set resins are used for example in the production of glass reinforced phenolic resins, for example by hand lay up processes in which liquid phenolic resin is manually applied to layers of glass fibre on a mould. It is desirable to obtain a reasonably short setting time so that the moulded product can be removed from the mould after a comparatively short time allowing reuse of the mould. It is knout to use strong acid catalyst e.g. mixtures of p toluene sulphonic acid phosphoric acid, to obtain a short setting time. However these mixtures give a very short pot life. The pot life is the time during which the phenolic resin mixture containing the acid catalyst can be worked before becoming too viscous. If the concentration of acid catalyst is reduced to increase pot life the cure time becomes excessively long. According to the present invention the process for curing a cold set phenolic resin containing 4 to 25 wt wt of water by the action of an acid catalyst comprises adding to the phenolic resin a hydrolysable substance Sshich hydrolyses in the phenolic resin to give a strong acid at a rate which is slow relative to the curing reaction. Those skilled in the production of phenolic resins will be aware of suitable phenolic resins for use in colc setting processes. samples of suitable phenolic resins are phenol Iormaldehyde resins. These are normally resol resins having a formaldehyde phenol mole ratio of greater than 1 1. While suc resins may be produced over a wide range of formaldehyde phenol mole ratios, the preferred materials are made using a formaldehyde phenol mole ratio of between 1.4 1 and 1.8 1. The resins must be liquid at ambient temperature and when used to make fibre reinforced products, the viscosity is desirably sufficiently lo to give good wetting of the fibre reinforcement.Typical resins have a viscosity in the range 100 to 2000 cps at 20to, more preferably in the range 350 to 800 cps. The final pH of the resin before use is preferably in the range 6 8. The water content of the resin is in the range 4 to 25X wt ut, more preferably in the range 8 15s wt wt. A typical value is 10 12, wt wt. The hydrolysable substance added to the phenolic resin is one which hydrolyses at ambient temperatures to give a strong acid. By strong acid we mean an acid which is substantially dissociated in S 10 aqueous solution at ambient temperature. The acid is preferably substantially completely dissociated.Examples of suitable acids are aryl sulphonic acids and HCl The hydrolysable substance is one which hydrolyses in the phenolic resin at a rate which is slow relative to the for the curing reaction at the setting temperature. The rate of hydrolysis is taken to be slow relative to the curing reaction if for a given quantity of hydrolysable material the pot life of the phenolic resin is at least twice, more preferably at least five times, most preferably at least ten times the pot life of the same resin into which is introduced a quantity of strong acid or acids equivalent to that produced by the complete hydrolysis of the hydrolysable material. Several classes of material for example esters and acid chlorides are known to hydrolyse to acids. However particularly preferred hydrolysable materials are the aromatic sulphonyl chlorides. These hydrolysis to give an aromatic sulphonic acid and hydrogen chloride. In order to obtain a uniform dispersion of hydrolysable material in the phenolic resin it is highly desirable for the aromatic sulphonyl chloride to be a liquid which dissolves readily in the resin. A particularly preferred hydrolysable material is benzene sulpbonyl chloride. The quantity of hydrolysable substance must of course be sufficient to fully cure the phenolic resin after hydrolyis has take place. The quantity of hydrolysable material used may for example be in the range 4 to 15 by weight based on the weight of resin. The invention will now be illustrated by reference to the following Examples.Example 1 A cold set phenolic resin was prepared by the alkaline condensation of phenol and formaldehyde at a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol greater than 1 1 to give a product with the following properties after neutralisation.

The results are given in the Table.Comparative Test A The same phenolic resin was used as in Example 1. Instead of benzene sulphonyl chloride varying quantities of a conventional acid catalyst viz.were added to samples of resin. Pot life and cure times obtained are given in the Table.

The hydrolysable substances are hydrolysed by the phenolic resin. The phenolic resin is most desirably substantially free from any substantial quantity of added acid or alkaline material. The addition of acids will undesirably increase the rate of hydrolysis of the bydrolysable substance and may also itself catalyse the setting reaction. Any such additional catalysis must be avoided. The hydrolysable substance must be essentially the sole catalyst used.The addition of alkalis will also undesirably increase the rate of hydrolysis.
