# Improvements in or relating to scroll type fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
A scroll type fluid displacement apparatus, in particu lar, a compressor unit is disclosed. The unit includes a housing comprising of a cup shaped casing 12 and a front end plate member 11 mounted on the casing to close its open end. A fixed scroll member with an end plate 251 and a spiral element 252 is formed with a plurality of legs 253 projecting from an end surface of the end plate opposite to an end surface from which the spiral element extends. An end surface of each leg is fitted against the inner surface of the cup shaped casing and fixed by screws inserted from outside of the casing whereby the fixed scroll member is fixedly disposed within the housing. A seal ring 29 is disposed between an outer peripheral surface of the scroll end plate and the inner surface of the casing. An inner chamber of the casing is thereby partitioned into two cham bers by the scroll end plate.
