# REUSABLE COUPLING

## Abstract
A coupling and method of coupling thin wall hose tubing and the like includes an inner member, a sleeve surrounding the inner member and the tubing therebetween. The inner member is provided with a pair of tubing grooves and a seal in a seal groove therebetween. By means of compression rings or annular ridges the tubing is forced into the tubing grooves and stretched across the seal, thus forming a fluid tight coupling member.
