# Rolling unit for a bar or the like rolling mill.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a rolling unit 1 having three rollers 3,4,5 with axes arranged at 120 , wherein the main roller shaft 6 derives its motion from a drive 9 and transmits it to the shafts 7,8 of the other two rollers 4,5 through bevel gears 10,11 . To simplify the assembly and service procedures, as well as to improve the roller adjust ment facilities, the main roller 3 is carried on a supporting body 12 which can be removably positioned on the unit casing 2 to allow axial adjustment of the main roller 3 . The respective shaft 6 engages rotatively, but in an axially slidable manner, with a coupling shaft 24 connected to the drive 9 . The supporting body 12 may be attached to the casing 2 radially, thereby it becomes possible to assemble the main shaft 6 together with the roller 3 , bearings 13 and gears 10 , and then secure the supporting body 12 on the casing 2 .
