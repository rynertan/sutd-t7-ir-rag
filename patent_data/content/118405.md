# POLYOL ALKALI METAL SILICATE EMULSION OF LOW WATER CONTENT, AND A PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION THEREOF

## Abstract
A process for the production of a polyol alkali metal silicate emulsion of low water content is described. The emulsion is intended primarily for the production of polyurethane plastics. The emulsion is obtained by mixing a composition which comprises a 19 65 by weight, preferably 40 60 by weight, of aqueous alkali metal silicate solution, having a water content of 40 62 by weight, preferably 50 60 by weight b 34 80 by weight, preferably 40 60 by weight, of polyol and c 1 5 by weight, preferably 2 3 by weight, of an organic acid. The water content of the emulsion is then reduced by evaporating the emulsion at a reduced pressure and at a temperature of 20 100 C, preferably 75 90 C, to a water content of 3 10 by weight, preferably 4 7 by weight. The evaporation time is up to 4 hours, preferably 2 3 hours.
