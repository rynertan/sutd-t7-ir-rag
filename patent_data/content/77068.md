# A folding knife.

## Abstract
A folding knife including a blade and a handle which are joined together by pivot means at a forward end of the handle, an axis of the pivot means is in the same plane as the blade and the handle and joins same to a tang portion of the blade so that the blade can pivot laterally from an extended position through about 180 to a second position where the blade lies within the confines of the handle, the top and or bottom of the tang is generally rectangular in section and engages in a similarly shaped recess formed in upper and or bottom arms of the handle, the upper and or bottom arms of the handle incorporate means for moving the arms apart to enable the tang to be disengaged from the recess to swing the blade laterally either to its open or closed position. The top of the tang can have means associated therewith which engage with shaped aperture in the arm of the handle adjacent thereto to lock the blade in its open or closed position. The means can be a rectangular lug formed on the tang or in the handle which is arranged to lock the handle, arm and tang in their open or closed position.
