## Abstract
Wind tunnel data for a three control surface aircraft 10 is developed for lift, pitching moment, and drag coefficient characteristics. This data is then input into a Lagrange optim ization program to determine a unique combination of can ard, flap, 18 and strake flap 20 positions that trimmed the pitching moment coefficient to zero and provided the mini mum drag coefficient as a function of lift coefficient and or angle of attack, Mach number, and altitude. This program is exercised over the entire Mach number, altitude, and angle of attack range of the aircraft. The output from the Lag range optimization program are then tabulated and loaded into the memory of a digital flight control computer 34 of an aircraft. As the aircraft flies, the angle of attack sensor 26 , air data sensor and altimeter 32 , determine the angle of attack, Mach number and altitude of the aircraft. By means of the com puter, the position of the control surfaces are changed to the predetermined settings of the look up table for minimum drag.
