# D.C. power supply.

## Abstract
A D.C. power supply for use in microwave ovens has a main circuit 100 and a control unit 200 . In the main circuit 100 an A.C. mains voltage is rectified by a rectification circuit 120 and then is chopped at at high frequency by means of a switching element 112 . The resultant voltage is smoothed by a capacitor 119 before applied to a magnetron 130 . The control unit 200 functions to control an ON OFF operation of the switching element 112 , and includes four control circuits 240, 220, 260 and 280 . The first control circuit 240 functions to vary the duty ratio of the control pulse in accordance with the rectified voltage level and the current flowing through switching element 112 . The second control circuit 220 limits the period of time during which the switching element performs an ON OFF operation in accordance with the level of the rectified voltage. The third and fourth control circuits 260, 280 are protective against excess currents and voltages respectively to prevent damage to the switching element and magnetron. By this circuit configuration, the magnetron 130 of the microwave oven is supplied with a continuously con trollable D.C. voltage of a flat waveform.
