# Device for oxygenating blood in extrabodily circulation with heat exchanger.

## Abstract
The affected technical field is that of medical equipment, and the invention relates to a device for oxygenating blood in extrabodily circulation with heat exchanger. The technical problem is that of providing an oxygenating device capable of handling in an optimum way different blood flow rates, as required by the varying ranges of patient s weight, from newly born children to full adults. The solution resides in providing a device comprising plural oxygenation modules, each of which has at least one member 9,10 for diffusing oxygen through the blood, and one shutter member 17,18 for shutting off such fluids and communicating to a chamber 22 wherethrough the pipes 24 of a heat exchanger extend, the modules communicating, in turn, to a collecting chamber 38 through a layer of an antifoaming material 35,36 .
