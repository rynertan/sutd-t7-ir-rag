# Device and method for removing slag from melt cut piece of steel.

## Abstract
A device for removing slag from meltcut piece of steel in which a cutting tool mounting base whose elevational and rotational movements are controlled is laterally installed perpendicular to and on the underside of a roller table for conveying a steel piece cut to a predetermined length by melt cutting, and tools for cutting off the slag from melt cutting are provided in the longitudinal direction of the outer surface of the base at at least a position symmetrical to the base. The cutting tool is composed of a plurality of cutting blades sequentially arranged from the front center at the input side of the steel piece to both sides of the rear. The cutting blades are so arranged that the levels they project gradually raise toward the rear, and the blades are elastically held by springs. A device for removing melt cutting slag from a steel piece of another embodiment has L shaped cutting blades disposed at the top at the front center on the input side of a steel piece are longitudinally arranged at a predetermined interval on a cutting tool mounting base elevationally movably installed in the vicinity of the lower surface of the steel piece so as to cut and remove the slag adhering to the lower surface of the melt cut steel piece in a predetermined length on a conveying roller table, and at least the rear cutting blades are held via springs mounted at the in lower positions on the base, and the cutting blades are so arranged that the levels the rear blades project are slightly higher than the cutting blades of the front cutting tools. When a water cooler for cooling the drooling part of the slag is provided at each of the front and the rear of the removing device to cut the drooling part thus hardened, the fused slag can be further effectively removed.
