# A projection unit including a glass reflector.

## Abstract
An improved projection unit 10 including a glass reflector 11 and a capsule member tungsten halogen lamp 13 and metallic retention member 31 removably posi tioned within the reflector. The projecting end of the metal retention member 31 is threaded only on two sides and adapted for having a single thread annular nut 53 posi tioned thereon to retain the capsule securely within the reflector. The nut is resilient to assure that damage to the reflector, boxlike members, or nut itself is prevented, and also to compensate for thermal expansion.
