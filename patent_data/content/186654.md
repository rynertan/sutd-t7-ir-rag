# Hand traffic signal for crossing the street.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a hand traffic signal for crossing the street, assigned to show the intention of the pedestrian to cross the street, particularly dedicated to children and aged people. The signal consists of housing, made of the two same and symmetrical halves, having slides on the inner surfaces, for sliding the handle while retracting. At the upper part of the sliding area, a stopper is positioned, and on the lower part two transversal slots are made. The halves have symmetrically positioned cotters and holes for proper positioning and fastening together, and a central opening each for positioning the catadioper plate. An axially slidable handle is positioned inside the body, made of one piece of material, according to one embodiment, or consisting of the two telescopic parts, according to the other embodiment.

Hand traffic signal according to claim 2, characterized in that on the lower end of the slot 4 a conical surface is made for leaning on the corresponding conical surface of the slide 9 .

## Description
HAND TRAFFIC SIGNAL FOR CROSSING THE STREETThe invention relates to a hand traffic signal for crossing the street, assigned to show the intention of the pedestrian to cross the street. It is particularly dedicated to children and aged people. According to International PatentClassification, the invention belongs to G 09 F 13 00.Standard unstop signals are well known, having a monolitic construction,consisting of circular part with a stop symbol in appropriate colour and a fixed handle.According to Yugoslav Patent application No.P 817 76, a signal for help is known, consisting of circular part with a red cross signal. on one side, and S.O.S. lettering on the other side, having a foldable handle. Known hand traffic signals are either weak sight catchers,or rather inappropriate for carrying in a pocket, because of relatively large overall dimensions.The invention as claimed..is intended to remedy and eliminate these drawbacks. It solves the problem of how to design a hand traffic.signal for crossing the street, allowing easy folding to small overall dimensions for easy carrying, while enabling better sight catching and recognizing the user.The advantages offerred by the inventions are mainly those that the user is easily recognised,owing to a catadiopter positioned on the body of the.signal and that the signal is easily carried,thanking to the retractible handle.One way of carrying out the invention, is described in detail hereinbelow, .with the reference tD the attached drawings, which illustrate one embodiment of the same,in which Figure 1 is a vertical front view of the signal Figure 2 iB a vertical side view of the signal, with the handle pulled out.Figure 3 is a vertical front view of the signal, with the handle retracted,Figure 4 is a vertical side view of the signal, with the handle retracted,Figure 5 is a vertical front view of the signal, with the handle pulled out and with one half of the housing removed,Figure 6 is a vertical front view of the signal, with the handle retracted and with one half of the housing removed,Figure 7 is a drawing showing the shape of one half of the housing lo.king frontally to the inner side,Figure 8 shows a cut along the line BIB on fig. 7,Figure 9 shews a cut along the line CO on fig. 7,Figure 10 shows the view in direction A on fig. 7,Figures 11 and 12 are detailed drawings of the handle with all the parts necessary for its functioning.Figure 1 shows the elements forming the retractible handle rod 3, made slideable into the tube 2, closed by the plug 1 which closes the tube and has cams 12 corresponding to slots 14, showed on the fig. 7, of the housing 5 in which the whole handle can be retracted, and catadiopters 6. Figure 2 shows the signal looking sideways, with the handle pulled out, and with a hole 11 in the plug 1 visible, for a rcpe dedicated for carrying the signal. As can be seen in the figure 5, an opening 13 is made in the central part of each half of the housing 5, for positioning the catadiopter 6. Each half of the housing 5 has cotters 8 and holes 7 for exact positioning of the halves while gluing. Sliding surfaces 9 are made at the inner side of each half of the housing 5, for directing the handle while retracting.Slots 4 lean directly on slides 9. Stopper 10 limits the movement of the handle in retracting direction.Figure 7 shows one half of the housing 5 without the handle, so that slots 14 are clearly visible. They correspond with cams 12 fig. 6 when the handle is completely retracted, preventing the handle from falling out of the housing. Figure 8, showing the cut BIB on fig.7, shows the conical part of the sliding surfaces 9, which gives firm contact between the handle and the body when the handle is fully pulled out, forming compression stresses between the sli des 9 and slots 4 fig. 5 .As can be seen on the fig. 12, rod 3 has a conical part 15 which makes a firm contact between the rod 3 and the tube 2 when the handle is fully expanded.Another embodiment of this invention is possible, in which the handle is made of one piece of matormal, with all the other characteristics of the invention unchanged.
