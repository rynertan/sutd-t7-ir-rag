# Snowless skiing device.

## Abstract
A device apt to permit skiing practice on snowless ground is described. The device in question makes possible a com plete efficient training, being suitable to simulate all possible operating conditions of a ski. According to a remarkable feature of the device of the invention, it allows to run across curves having any bending radius if it is driven by the user acting on the device in the same manner as on a normal ski. The device comprises two sets of sliding wheels 1 , the wheels of each set being connected by a cross element 2 . Said cross elements 2 are pivoted independently from each other to an essentially central shaped plate 5 forming the means to which the user s foot is secured. Between the plate 5 and cross elements 2 elastic means 10 are interposed whose elongation degree and the resulting angle Î± formed at rest between said plate 5 and cross element 2 are limited by an adjustable stop means 24 .
