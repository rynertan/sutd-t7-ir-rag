# Distributed processing environment fault isolation.

## Abstract
In a machine having a plurality of operating components controlled by a plurality of processors 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 82 one of the processors is designated the master processor 70 . All the other processors report their faults to the master processor. When it receives a fault message, the master processor records the type of fault and the source of the message in suitable memory locations, The master will also time stamp the fault message to identify the first fault message. Finally, the master will transmit a message to itself to verify that the master s communication channel is valid to verify whether the master processor itself or one of the remote processors is faulty.
