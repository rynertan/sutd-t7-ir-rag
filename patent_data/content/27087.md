# Integral electrical contact and method of making an integral electrical contact.

## Abstract
An integral electrical contact 10, 110, 210 and a method for making the electrical contact is disclosed. The contact includes an elongated electrical conducting base portion 19, 119, 219 which has an axial passage 29, 129, 229 extending therethrough and also includes several axially aligned electrical wires 20, 120, 220 in tegrally formed with the base portion. The wires are axially aligned with the passage of the base portion and extend beyond a first end 18, 118, 218 of the base por tion. Each of the wires which extends beyond the first end of the base portion includes an end portion 24, 124, 224 that terminates in an acutely angled surface. The electrical contact is made by coining an electrically con ductive flat sheet of material 12 to form a plurality of elongated raised design portions 14, 16, 114, 116, 214, 216 which are axially aligned and extend inwardly from one end surface 13 of the sheet. The design portions are separated by slitting the sheet between the design portions of by further coining the sheet to form the wires. A bevel is placed on the ends of the wires are slit apart. The sheet is then rolled so that the wires are axially aligned and adjacent to each other.
