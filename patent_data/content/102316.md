# METHOD OF MOLDING TIRES

## Abstract
An improved method of molding tires is disclosed, wherein the improvement consists in that tire molding is carried out by way of the steps of detecting movement of a stitcher tool during the tire molding under manual handling with the aid of a position detecting device, detecting at least either of the number of revolutions and the direction of rotation of a molding drum with the aid of a rotation detecting device, storing the results of detecting in a storage device and thereafter automatically controlling movement of the stitcher tool as well as at least either of the number of revolutions and the direction of rotation of the molding drum by processing signals issued from the storage device. Further, another improved method of molding tires is disclosed according to other aspect of the invention, wherein the improvement consists in that tire molding is carried out by way of the steps of detecting movement of a stitcher tool during tire molding under manual handling for a series of processes comprising turn down, bead stitch, turn up and ply lock with the aid of a position detecting device, detecting at least either of the number of revolutions and the direction of rotation of a molding drum with the aid of a rotation detecting device, detecting movement of a pull out device under manual handling with the aid of a position detecting device prior to carrying out turn up processes after comple tion of bead stitch process, storing the results of detecting in a storage device and thereafter automatically controlling movement of the stitcher tool, at least either of the number of revolutions and the direction of rotation of the molding drum and movement of the pull out device by processing signals issued from the storage device.
