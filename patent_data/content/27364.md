## Abstract
The system allows user interaction with a prerecorded program which includes live video displays and alphanumeric displays. The user can select the program desired and also inputs answers to specific questions asked by the program. A standard video playback device 40 is modified by the addi tion of a small computer and memory circuit 64 , and charac ter display circuitry 66 . The invention operates the video playback device to produce a video output. Prerecorded prog ram information includes data dumps interspersed with video display segments and the data in the data dumps is recovered by a data recovery circuit 62 . The computer then commands the video playback device to access different portions of the recorded video program in response to user input and the operating instructions provided by the data recovered.
