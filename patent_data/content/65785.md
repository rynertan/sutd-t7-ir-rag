# Waveguide for laser beams.

## Abstract
A laser waveguide is developed which uses various combinations of convex and concave mirrors in conjugate pairs. The waveguide is made more effications by arranging the mirrors and selecting the reflective surfaces therof so that the diametral increase of a plurality of parallel light beams is checked, or the diameter reduced.
