## Description
PROCESS so FOR PREPARING THERMALLY STABLE AMMONIUMNITRATE CONTAINING GRANULES OF HIGH BULK DENSITY The invention relates to a process for preparing thermally stable ammoniumnitrate containing granules of high bulk density, on the basis of a melt containing magnesiumnitrate and ammoniumnitrate. A process of this kind is known from US Patent SpecificationNo. 4.316.736. According to this process an ammoniumnitrate containing solution, which includes a maximum of 20 Z by weight, in particular 5 10 Z wt., of water and 0.5 3 Z wt. magnesiumnitrate, is sprayed onto a fluidized bed of ammonium nitrate seed particles having a temperature of between 120 and 135 C, after which the granules discharged from the bed are cooled at such a slow rate that they remain virtually homogeneous in temperature in the range between 70 and 50 C. A disadvantage of this known process is that the finished product has a rather high water content about 0.3 wt. . When stored granules with such a high water content show increased caking tendency and poorer hygroscopic behaviour, which in general makes it necessary to apply rather a large quantity of coating agent to them. Another disadvantage of this process is that in the 70 50 C range the granules need to be cooled slowly, which means that for a given quantity of product a relatively big cooling installation is required. In addition, application of this cooling method implies the necessity of using more than one cooling stage, in general three discrete stages one for cooling down to 70 OC, one for the 70 50 0C range, one for the range below 50 C . Finally, this process has the disadvantage of a rather high bed temperature being applied. It has been found that at high bed temperatures the seeds in the bed show increased caking tendency and that the product discharged from the bed is more difficult to crush. According to another known process see British Patent Specification No. 990,487 an ammoniumnitrate melt or solution, which may or may not contain magnesiumnitrate, is granulated at a relatively low bed temperature 106 108 OC by the so called cold spherodizer method. In dependence on the water content of the ammoniumnitrate, this results in a more or less porous product. For instance, if the product is made from a 99.8 melt, its bulk density will be about 910 g l, if it is made from a 95 solution, about 835 g l. A disadvantage of this known process is therefore, that the bulk density of the product obtained is rather low. Moreover, the water content is found to remain rather high. The invention provides a process ruling out the abovementioned disadvantages completely or almost completely. According to the invention, this is achieved in that an ammoniumnitrate containing melt including at most 1.5 Z wt. water and 0.2 1 Z wt. magnesiumnitrate, calculated as magnesiumoxide in relation to the quantity of ammoniumnitrate, is sprayed, at a temperature at least 5 OC above its crystallization point, onto or into a fluidized or spouted bed of ammoniumnitrate containing seed particles having a temperature of between 90 and 120 oC, and the granules formed are continuously discharged from the bed. With the process according to the invention a granular product is obtained which, on the one hand, has high thermal stability and a high bulk density, and, on the other hand, has an extremely low water content 0 2 Z wit. and excellent impact and crushing resistance, whilst hardly caking. Besides, it is found to be unnecessary in this process to apply slow cooling as is described in US Patent Specification 4.316.736 in the range between 70 and 50 OC. Use can therefore be made of a rapid cooling method, e.g. fluid bed cooling, which brings an economization in cooling equipment. All the more so, as it has been found that rapid cooling of the granules results in a product of increased bulk density. By preference use is made of a melt which contains at most 0.5 wt. water and 0.3 0.4 wt. magnesiumnitrate, calculated as magnesiumoxide in relation to the quantity of ammoniumnitrate, and in which the amount of water is equal to or smaller than the amount of magnesiumnitrate. The magnesiumnitrate may be added as such to the melt or to the ammoniumnitrate solution to be subjected to evaporation.It is also possible to add magnesiumoxide, or a magnesium salt reacting in situ while forming magnesiumnitrate, to the nitric acid used for the preparation of ammoniumnitrate or to the ammoniumnitrate obtained therefrom after ammoniation and, possibly, evaporation The temperature of the melt should be at least 5 OC above the crystallization temperature, and should, in general, be lower than the temperature at which the melt boils at atmospheric pressure. The melt can be sprayed onto the bed of seed particles, for instance by means of a single phase spray. By preference the melt is sprayed into the bed. This can be done in a known way by means of an air current, for instance in a two phase spray. In particular, the melt is sprayed from the bottom upward into a fluid bed. For spraying the melt use is made advantageously of an air current having a temperature that is about equal to or slightly lower than that of the melt, in such an amount that the air to melt mass ratio is 1 1 to 1 4. The fluidization gas is passed through the bed of seeds from bottom to top, with, in general, a superficial velocity that is 1.5 2.5 times, in particular about twice, the minimum fluidization velocity.By 1minimum fluidization velocity is understood the minimum velocity that suffices to support the weight of the seed particles in the bed in the case of NH4N03 with a mean particle size of 3 mm, it is about 1.2 m sec . The temperature of the fluidization gas air may vary. In general such a temperature is applied that, in combination with the temperature of the seeds fed in, the resulting bed temperature will have the desired value. The seed particles used are by preference formed by the oversize and undersize fractions obtained after screening of the granules discharged from the bed, with the oversize fraction being crushed before use. If so desired, it is also possible to return part of the product fraction, after crushing. The amount of the material returned to the bed may vary by preference it is such that the weight ratio of returned material to inflowing melt is l 1 to 1 2. The diameter of the seeds introduced into the bed is preferably between 0.75 and 2.0 mm.The height of the bed is in general 0.5 to 1.0 m. The temperature of the bed 90 120 C is determined by temperature and quantity of the melt, the spray gas, the fluidization gas, and the incoming seeds. The heat input, notably the input in the form of heat of crystallization of the melt and the spray gas is such that for maintaining the bed temperature at a value below 90 OC, special provi sions would be required, which provisoins would make the process appreciably more expensive, whereas for maintaining a temperature above 120 C an extra heat input into the bed would be required. In particular, the temperature of the bed is controlled with the aid of the temperature of the fluidization gas and that of the seeds fed in recycle material . For reasons of economy, such a temperature is preferably used that the fluidization gas requires no or hardly any preheating, so that, for instance, air of ambient temperature, or, for instance, the air from the cooling stage, if used, can be applied. It has further proved to be of importance not to cool the recycled seed material to below about 50 C, in connection with the crystal phase transitions of the ammoniumnitrate. By preference the bed temperature is controlled at 100 110 OC, with fluidization gas having a temperature of between about 15 and 60 OC, and recycled material having a temperature of between 50 and 100 OC being applied. The latter temperature can be obtained by cooling the granules discharged from the bed before they are screened, and or by cooling the recycle material. The granules discharged from the bed are cooled before and or after screening. By preference use is made to this end of a rapid cooling technique, in particular of fluid bed cooling, performed in one or more coolers. The heated cooling gas air leaving the cooler s can advantageously be used as fluidization gas for the bed of seeds. The air issuing from the fluidized bed can be cleaned of dust particles in a known way, for instance by washing with water or a dilute solution containing ammoniumnitrate. The product granules resulting after screening and cooling can be further in a known way for instance, a coating agent can be applied to them, to prevent dust formation and or moisture absorption. Drying of the product obtained by the present process is not necessary. It may be of importance, however, to subject the granules discharged from the bed, optionally after cooling and or screening, to a regular rolling motion in a rotary drum at constant temperature, with exclusion of current air, so as to effect a further rise of the bulk density. Although the present process has special importance for the preparation of ammoniumnitrate granules, it can be used also for pre paring granules whtch, in addition to ammoniumnitrate and magnesiumnitrate, contain other components, for instance fillers marlstone or dolomite , trace elements, agrochemicals herbicides etc. , and fertilizer salts. The invention will be further elucidated in the following examples.Example 1 A continuous flow of an ammoniumnitrate melt, amounting to 92 kg h, was supplied to a circular fluid bed granulator having a diameter of 45 cm and provided with a perforated bottom, which contained a bed of ammoniumnitrate seed particles mean diameter 3 mm having a height of 40 cm. The melt, which had a temperature of 170 C and contained 0.54 wt. water and 0.33 wt. magnesiumnitrate, calculated as magnesiumoxide, was sprayed laterally into the bed by means of a twophase spray, with the help of a current of air temperature 167 C . The spraying air was supplied at the rate of 59 kg h.The bed of particles had a temperature of 105 CC and was fluidized by means of an upward air current temp. 85 OC , flowing with a superficial velocity of 2.44 m sec, at the rate of 1180 kg h. Via an overflow, granules were continuously discharged from the bed to a screen, where they were separated into a fine fraction particle size 2 mm , a product fraction 2 4 mm , and a coarse fraction 4 mm , which last fraction was subsequently crushed on crusher rollers. The fine fraction and the crushed coarse fraction were then returned to the bed at a temperature of about 90 95 OC. The product fraction was rapidly cooled in a fluid bed cooler to about 30 OC. The product properties were as shown in the table below. Part of this product was cooled to about 15.or and then heated to 50 OC and cooled to 15 OC fives times. The product thus treated had a crushing strength of 35 bar and an oil absorption capacity of 1.10 wt. No measurable increase in volume had occurred.Example 2 In the same way as described in Example 1, 92 kg h of an NH4N03 melt, containing 0.54 x wt. water and 0.33 wt. MgO in.the form of magnesiumnitrate, and having a temperature of 170 OC, was sprayed, with the help of 43 kg h air temp. 165 OC through a two phase spray, laterally into a bed of seeds temp. 116 C fluidized by means of 1180 kg h air, flowing with a superficial velocity, of 2.51 m sec and having a temperature of 95 C. The properties of the product granules obtained after screening and cooling are, again shown in the table. Part of the product was subjected to five 15 50 C cycles. The granules then resulting had a crushing strength of 40 bar and an oil absorption capacity of 0.75 wt.No measurable increase in volume had occurred.
