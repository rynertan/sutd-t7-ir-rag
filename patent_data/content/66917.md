# Gamma tomography apparatus comprising a parallelogram suspension system.

## Abstract
In a radiation apparatus with an element 8 which is carried by a balanced suspension system 14 and which is to be positioned relative to an object, the element 8 and a counterweight 36 are carried by a par allelogram suspension system 14 in order to increase the adjusting accuracy and the freedom of movement. In order to obtain a smooth, static movement, even during rotation of the entire suspension system, the positioning function and the supporting function of one of the pivotal supports are separated, each function be ing performed by a separate pivot.
