# Novel organism and use thereof in production of functionalized whey products.

## Abstract
A biologically pure culture of the organism Xanthomo nas campestris ATCC 31923 is disclosed. A process for the production of a functionalized dairy whey product characterised in that it comprises a providing a fermentation broth of whey and yeast extract and b fermenting the broth with the organism Xanthomo nas campestris ATCC 31923 to produce a functionalized dairy whey product containing a thickening polymer produced by the organism and, optionally, c drying the functionalized whey product to form a dry functionalized whey product is also disclosed. Dairy whey, a waste product of cheese production, may be functionalized by fermentation techniques to produce a functionalized whey which serves as a thickening agent in the food industry. This simultaneously provides a method for utilizing the whey waste produced.
