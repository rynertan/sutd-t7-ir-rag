# Porous structure for fluid contact.

## Abstract
A porous structure 5 through which at least one fluid flows, consisting of plural honeycomb blocks 1 each of which has partition walls 2a, 2b defining a multiplicity of parallel channels 3 . The plural honeycomb blocks 1 are superposed on each other such that the corresponding parallel channels 3 formed in adjacent ones of the plural honeycomb blocks 1 communicate with each other. The parallel channels 3 in one of the honeycomb blocks 1 are inclined with respect to the corresponding parallel channels 3 in the adjacent honeycomb blocks 1 such that the parallel channels 3 formed in the plural honeycomb blocks 1 cooperate to form a multiplicity of zigzag fluid passages extending through the porous structure 5 .
