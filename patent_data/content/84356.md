# Pulse generator.

## Abstract
A pulse generator for producing a PWM signal having a pulse width modulation determined by the bit information contained in a digital input signal, having upper and lower bits, is disclosed, with preferred use in a digital analog converter. The generator generates a plurality of pulses having their pulse widths modulated corresponding to said upper bits, and the pulse widths thereof are further enlarged in accordance with said lower bits by shifting the leading and or trailing edges, respectively, of one or more selected ones of said pulses by a duration of one half cycle period of a clock signal. Even using a clock signal of low frequency a PWM signal having a high pulse repetition frequency and a low level of the minimum residual frequency contained therein can be obtained, which can easily be smoothened into an analogue signal by using a small size low pass filter having a low time constant.
