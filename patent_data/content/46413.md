# Recording medium.

## Abstract
A recording medium has a substrate 1 and formed thereon an inorganic material layer 2 adapted to absorb light to generate heat and an organic material recording layer 4 adapted to be deformed or removed by the heat. To give the recording medium stability against changes in ambient temperature, an intermediate layer 3 is located between the inorganic material layer 2 and the recording layer 4. The intermediate layer is made of an organic mate rial containing metal, e.g. a metal salt of an organic acid, an organometallic compound, etc.
