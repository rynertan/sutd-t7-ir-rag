# Engine parts.

## Abstract
Engine parts having high durability, which can be used at high operating temperatures, comprise components 23 consisting mainly of partially stabilized zirconia having high strength in which the thermal expansion hysteresis differ ence of thermal expansion at an optional temperature in the thermal expansion during heating up and the thermal shrinkage during cooling down is less than 0.4 and the thermal expansion coefficient is more than 10 10 ⁶ C. Preferred such engine parts consist of a ceramic metal composite body wherein the partially stabilized zirconia and a metal 22 are bonded and wherein the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the ceramic and the metal is less than 3 10 ⁶ C.
