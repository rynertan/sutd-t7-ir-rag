# TESTING MATERIAL FOR DETECTING ALCOHOLS

## Abstract
A testing material for detecting alcohols is described, comprising a NAD or NADP, b alcohol dehydrogenase, c 1 thermophilic microorganism derived diaphorase, or 2 diaphorase and dextran, d a dye and e a carrier. This testing material has very good storage stability and can measure alcohol concentrations, in particular ethanol concentrations in saliva, enzymatically with ease. It is useful in detecting and preventing driving while under the influence of liquor.
