## Description
Injection molding and extrusion of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene This invention relates to a method of injection molding ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, and to a method of screw extruding ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. The invention further relates to a novel composition of matter, namely pellets of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene which are substantially free of fine powders. Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene hereinafter referred to as UHE7 PE possesses various outstanding properties such as very high energy absorption characteristics impact strength , abrasion resistance and chemical resistance. Commercially available ultra high molecular weight polyethylenes are generally fine powders, and the predominant portion of which are particles of less than 1 mm in size. The very high melt viscosity and poor fluidity of UHMW PE, however, have hampered its potential applicatiions. It is well known that it is very difficult to shape UHMW PE by extrusion or injection molding method. When injection molding of UHEV PE powder is attempted by use of the conventional injection molding technique, one often encounters difficulty with feeding the powder through the screw plasticator, and the resultant product has an easily peelable, mica like structure. Therefore, such polyethylenes are molded by compression molding techniques. The injection molding method has various wellknown advantages over the compression molding method. For instance, injection molding generally has a better work efficiency than compression molding, and also affords molded articles having a complex shape which cannot be obtained by compression molding. In view of the difficulty of the injection molding of UHMW PE, people desirous of obtaining a molded article of UHMW PE having a complex shape often had to resort to a means where a starting piece obtained by compression molding is machined down to the final article of the desired shape. This method, however, has obvious disadvantages of low work efficiency and a large material loss. US Patent 4 164 531 teaches a method of injection molding UHMW PE wherein a UHMI PE having an intrinsic viscosity of 3 30 at 135 C in decalin which corresponds to the molecular weiqht range of 5.1 x 105 8.5 x 106 according to our formula explained below is flashed into a mold cavity having a volume of 1.5 to 3.0 times that of the injected polyethylene and the temperature of which cavity is maintained above the melting point of the material, and then the mold cavity is reduced to a volume of less than 1.5 times that of the injected polyethylene to compress and unite the.powder particles to form a coherent molded product. It is noticed that the method of above said patent is not a usual type of injection molding, but rather a hybrid of injection molding and compression molding.Thus, it has the disadvantages that the apparatus tends to be more expensive than the conventional injection molding machine where the mold cavity does not have the extra hydraulic pressure system attached thereto to change the mold volume, and that certain limitations attach as to the shapes of the articles moldable by said method. US Patent 3 660 552 teaches a method of forming a molded article of a cross linked thermoplastic polymer wherein a cross linking agent is mixed with athermoplastic polymer, the solid mixture is conveyed at a temperature of about 20 110 0C and injected into a mold cavity through at least one nozzle under a pressure of about 1800 3000 kg cm2, and the material is cross linked and molded at a temperature of about 180 300 0C which is above the melting point of the original thermoplastic material.Again, it will be noted that said method is not a usual injection molding in that the mold temperature is kept above the melting point of the original thermoplastic material. US Patent 3 036 340 teaches a method of molding high molecular weight polyethylene wherein a preform is prepared from a mixture of the polyethylene powder and a small amount of a stabilizer by use of a press, the resultant preform is placed in an injection pot maintained at 252 0C 485 0F , and by applying a pressure of at least 5.52 x 107N.m 8000 psi upon the preform by use of a ram, it is injected or transferred to a mold cavity maintained at a temperature of 127 177 C 260 3500F and kept there for about 16 minutes while the pressure and the temperature are maintained at said values, and thereafter the mold cavity is gradually cooled below the flow temperature of said preform. This method is called transfer molding.A relatively high cavity temperature is used, namely, at least above the softening point of the material a high pressure is applied to the system a heating cooling cycle of the mold cavity temperature is necessary for each molding cycle, and the combination of these factors cut down the work efficiency of the method. US Patent 3 665 069 teaches the extrusion of UHMW PE where a heterogeneous composite of 75 99 parts by weight of UHMW PE and 1 25 parts by weight of a carrier is supplied to an extruder comprising a transport screw. The carrier is a petroleum wax, liquid hydrocarbon l44 290 or synthetic waxes or a combination thereof. This method requires an addition of a substantial amount of carrier to UHMW PE in order to carry out the screw extrusion. US Patent 3 219 728 discloses a composition comprising 10 50 parts by weight of a normally solid, fusible alkane hydrocarbon per 100 parts by weight of UHMW PE. The composition is intended primarily for extrusion. It has a high percentage of carrier. Against the background, the present inventor has discovered that ultra high molecular weight polyethylene can be injection molded to obtain products of satisfactory qualities that are essentially equivalent to those obtained by compression molding, by use of conventional screw injection molding machines if the polyethylene powder is first compacted into pellets, for instance, by use of a pellet machine, and if the molding conditions are judiciously chosen. Moreover, it has been discovered that the removal of residual fine powders from the pellets affords a composition particularly suitable for obtaining good quality products by the injection molding method of this invention. Furthermore, the present inventor has discovered that the pellets of UHMW PE can be screw extruded relatively easily. Thus in one aspect, the invention provides a method of injection molding ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having a molecular weight of at least 1 x 106 as determined from its intrinsic viscosity in decalin solution at 1350C by the formula, MW 5.37 x 4 10 intrinsic viscosity 1 49, which method comprises feeding pellets of said polyethylene, which have been prepared by compacting the said polyethylene in powder form to form said pellets having a density of at least 0.9 g ml, to a screw injection molding machine in which the barrel temperature is maintained at 232 343 0C and the mold temperature at 50 150 C. The method of injection molding UHMW PE according to the invention uses a conventional screw injection molding machine and has a high work efficiency, yet affords satisfactory products having qualities essentially equivalent to those obtained by the compression molding method. In another aspect, the invention provides a method of screw extruding ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having a molecular weight of at least 1 x 106 as determined from its intrinsic viscosity in decalin solution at 1350C by the formula, MW 5.37 x,104 intrinsic viscosity 1.49 which method comprises feeding pellets of said polyethylene, which have been prepared by compacting said polyethylene in powder form to form said pellets having a density of at least 0.9 g ml, to a screw extruder in which the barrel temperature is maintained at 260 372 0C. In a still further aspect, the invention provides substantially powder free pellets having a density of at least 0.9 g ml when measured as individual pieces, which are prepared by compacting, with the application of physical force, a composition consisting substantially of powders of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having a molecular weight of at least 1 x 10 as determined from its intrinsic viscosity in decalin solution at 135 0C by the formula, MW 5.37 x 104 intrinsic viscosity 1.49 into a coherent aggregage state and then substantially separating out powders remaining in the compacted pieces. The pellets of UHMW PE substantially free of fine powders according to the invention are particularly useful for the injection molding and the screw extrusion methods of this invention. The injection molding method of this invention comprises feeding UHMW PE pellets prepared, for instance, by use of a pellet mill, to a conventional screw invention molding machine, wherein the barrel temperature is maintained at 232 343 0C 450 6500F and more preferably at 260 3160C 560 600 F , and the mold temperature is maintained at 50 l050C and more preferably at 55 l000C. The term Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene as used herein means polyethylene having a molecular weight of at least about 1 x 106 determined from the intrinsic viscosity of a sample in decalin at 135 C according to the formula MW 5.37 x 104 intrinsic viscosity 1.49 According to the method of this invention, UHMW PE may now be injection molded into articles of various shapes and sizes by use of a conventional screw injection molding machine. The operation proceeds smoothly without encountering such difficulties and problems as the clogging up of the transfer system and insufficient coherency or lamination of the molded article which usually occur when one attempts to injection mold powders of UHMW PE. According to the method of this invention, the molding cycle is short and the work efficiency high.The method does not require any heating cooling cycle of the mold cavity it is kept at a relatively low constant temperature that is considerably lower than the melting point of UHMW PE. According to this invention, many conventional screw injection molding machines can be used. The apparatus does not require any particularly high hydraulic pressure systems. According to the injection molding method of this invention, molded articles of UHMW PE having various complex shapes not moldableiby compression molding method can be obtained. The physical properties of the molded products are essentially equivalent to those of the compression molded products The invention is illustrated by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a rack molded in accordance with the injection molding method according to the invention Figure 2 shows a top plan view of the rack shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 shows an electron scanning microscope picture at x 5000 magnification of a commercially available UHMW PE powder and Figure 4 shows an electron scanning microscope picture at x 5000 magnification of the typical morphology of particles of UHMV PE after they have been compacted into pellets. The rack shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 exemplifies a type of article that one can injection mold according to the method of this invention. Another aspect of this invention is a novel method of screw extruding UHMW PE wherein pellets of UHMW PE described above, instead of powders of UH PE, are fed to a conventional screw extruder, and the barrel temperature and the die temperature are maintained within the temperature range of 260 3720C 500 7000F . According to this method a various extrusion molded article of UHMW PE having a satisfactory quality can be obtained. The injection molding method and the screw extrusion method of this invention are particularly useful where the molecular weight of polyethylene to be molded is above 1 x 106. The invention thus generally described may be more clearly understood from the following detailed description of the invention. Pellets of UHMW PE can be conveniently prepared from the powder in various ways including the use of a pellet mill and of a tablet press. The pellet as used herein is not limited to any specific shape or size. It is not limited as to the method of preparation. It shall cover any compacted aggregate of UHMW PE powder. The pellet, however, must have a density of at least 0.9 g ml when measured as an individual piece, which is substantially higher than the bulk density of the original powder, and a reasonable degree of coherency such that the pellet does not break up easily under a mild external force, for instance, handling of the pellets with fingers.It has been found that use of a commercial pellet mill is the most convenient way of preparing UHMW PE pellets suitable for the methods of this invention.Pellet mills produce pellets in a continuous manner in contrast to the intermittent operation of such devices as tablet presses. In a typical pellet mill,UHWM PW powder is continuously forced through holes provided in a circular die. Said force is supplied by a rotation of a roller which is placed close to the inner perimeter of the circular die. Thus, strands of compacted UHMW PE continuously come out of the die and they are broken to short lengths by a blade or blades placed near the outer perimeter of the die. Usually the strands have a circular cross section. Typical sizes of the cross section are 3.2 mum 1 8 inch and 6.4 mm 1 4 inch in diameter.The distribution of the lengths of the pellets depends on the operating condition of the pellet mill. Typically, the predominant portion of the pellets has the length in the range of 4.8 mm 3 16 inch . The density of the individual pellet is usually above 0.9, and typically about 0.93. The bulk density values of the commercial UHMW PE powders are usually below 0.5.The overall size of the pellet is not critical for the purpose of this invention, but the pellet must have a reasonable degree of coherency. For this purpose, the density of the pellet must be at least 0.90. When a typical commercial pellet mill is operated a considerable amount of heat is generated within the system due to friction, etc. Thus, it is believed that it is the combination of mechanical force and heat that accomplishes the compacting of the powder into hard pellets. Figure 3 is a typical appearance, as observed under a scanning electron microscope at x 5000 magnification, of a commercial UHMW PE powder. The picture covers a portion of a single particle and shows fine structures comprising nodules of less than about 1 pm size, crevices and fibrous structures.Figure 4 shows a scanning electron microscope picture at x 5000 magnification of an interior structure of a typical pellet prepared by a commercial pellet mill. The surface under observation was created by breaking the pellet in half by hand. It is noticed that the fine structure of the original powder mentioned above have substantially disappeared. The pellets thus prepared may break up to some extent during transportation and handling giving off some coarse particles . Such coarse particles are much larger than the fine powders which constitute the usual commercial ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. Such coarse particles usually pass 12 mesh screen 1.68 mm and are retained on 60 mesh screen 0.25 mm , whereas the size of the commercialUHMW PE powder is such that usually more than 98 weight per cent of the powder passes 60 mesh screen 0.25 mm .A minor amount of said coarse particles does not interfere with the injection molding of this invention. A small amount about 1 by weight or less of fine powders usually exist in the pelletized product coming out of the pellet mill. Most of these fine powders are believed to be the powders that came through the die of the pellet mill without ever being pelletized.It has been found that these fine powders are detrimental to the practice of this invention and that it is desirable to remove such fine powders before feeding the pellets to the injection molding machine. The removal of such fine powders can be accomplished, for instance, by use of a powder sieve. In contrast to the methods used in the patents mentioned earlier, the method of this invention uses a relatively low mold temperature in accordance with the usual practice of injection molding. Since there is no heating cooling cycle involved in the method of this invention, the molding cycle is short. The mold temperature is kept substantially constant during the molding cycle. The mold temperature range of 50 1050C may be used for the method of this invention, but the preferred temperature range is 55 100 C, and most preferably about 70 850C. Below about 550C physical properties of the molded product such as tensile strength and Izod value tend to deteriorate.Above about l000C, the molded article tends to stick to the die surface, and the problem of warpage becomes more significant warpage of the molded article occurs due to the application of physical force thereto by the ejector pin as well as due to the gradual shrinkage of the material after cooling . With regard to the barrel temperature, the temperature range of 232 343 0C 450 6500F may be used for the inj,ection molding method of this invention.The preferred temperature range is 260 3160C 500 6000F . Below 232 0C 450 0F , difficulty tends to arise in the conveyance of the material. Above 3430C 6500F ., the tendency of the chemical decomposition of UHMW PE becomes more pronounced. Thermal degradation of the material tends to discolor the products and reduce the physical properties. Where a coloring agent such as a pigment is added to the starting material, slight discoloration due to high temperature will go unnoticed, but where no coloring agent is added to the material, it is of course preferable to minimize discoloration. With regard to the screw design suitable for injection molding UHMW PE according to the method of this invention, it has been found that the preferable range of the compression ratio , namely, the ratio of the maximum root diameter of the screw to the minimum root diameter, is 2.0 2.5. Addition of a small amount less than about 0.5 weight per cent of stabilizer and or lubricant to the starting material does not significantly alter the operation conditions of the method of this invention. Thus, for instance, when 0.1 of Topanol CA a hindered phenol type anti oxidant and 0.32 of dilauroyl dithio dipropionate were added to UHMW PE powder and the mixture pelletized, it was observed that the addition did not significantly affect the injection molding process.It is to be noted that the present invention does not require the addition of a carrier to UHMW PE as do US Patents 3 665 068 and 3 219 728 referred to earlier. Injection molding as well as screw extrusion of UHMW PE can be accomplished, according to the methods of this invention, without adding any carrier to the starting materials. As mentioned earlier, the injection molding method of this invention is characterised by a short molding cycle. Although it depends on various factors, the typical cycle time is 1 2 minutes. The method of this invention does not employ any excessive injection pressure. Typically the injection pump pressure is about 6.9 x 106 N.m 2 1000 psig during the stage called packing the mold . The screw extrusion method of this invention employs the same pellets of UHMW PE as described above. The barrel temperature of the screw extruder is to be maintained within the range of 260 3720C 500 7000F .The die temperature is to be maintained also within the range of 260 3720C 500 7000F . While it is extremely difficult to screw extrude UHMW PE when the feed material is in the original powder form, it has been discovered that the present invention which employs a pelletized form of UHMW PE accomplishes the purpose relatively easily.Thus, the screw extrusion method of this invention is a method of processing UHMW PE wherein pellets of UHMW PE are fed to a screw extruder, the barrel temperature of which is maintained within the range of 260 3720C 500 7000F and the die temperature of which is maintained also within the range of 260 372 0C t500 7000F . It is helpful, as in the case of the injection molding, to substantially remove the fine powders existing in the pelletized UHMW PE in order to facilitate the screwextrusion method of this invention and also to obtain products having better qualities. The screw extrusion method of this invention does not require the addition of a carrier to the starting material.Once again, the pellet to be used for the method of this invention for screw extruding UHMW PE is not limited as to the size, shape or the method of preparation, but it must have a density of at least 0.9 g ml. The following examples are given for the purpose of illustration of this invention. Example 1 A commercial ultra high molecular weight polyethylene powder molecular weight was 4 x 106, and more than 99 of the powder passed 60 mesh screen 0.25 mm was fed to a commercial pellet mill. The cross sectional size of the pellets was 3.2 mm 1 8 inch in diameter. The density of the individual pellets was about 0.93 g ml. The resultant pellets were sieved by use of a 12 mesh 1.68 mm sieve in order to remove fine powder particles. These pellets were fed to a commercial 765 g 27 ounce size injection molding machine having a single screw. Flat plaques of 159 x 216 x 2.5 mm 6 1 4 x 8 1 2 x 1 10 size and racks shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 were molded while varying the mold temperature and the barrel temperature. The rack, as can be seen from Figure 1 and Figure 2, is not a flat sheet, but has a complex shape. It has a 273 mm 10 3 4 length and 133 mm 5.1 4 width, and the thickness is about 15.9 mm 5 8 at the thickest portion. The two kinds of molded articles were subjected to various physical property tests, i.e., density, abrasion resistance, tensile strength at yield and fail, tensile elongation at fail and impact strength value.Abrasion resistance was measured by the standardSand Slurry Test and the result is expressed in terms of weight loss. Tensile strength and tensile elongation tests were conducted according to ASTM D 638Impact strength values were determined substantially in accordance with ASTM D 256, namely, the notch was changed from the conventional single Izod notch to a razor cut notch on opposite sides of the test speciimen. The results are summarised in Table 1. For the sake of comparison, plaques of 305 x 305 x 6.4 mm 12 x 12 x 1 4 size were compression molded from the same UHMW PE powder as used above by applying 219 kN 22 tons force on a 254 mm 10 inch diameter ram. The heating period was thirty minutes and the cooling period was also thirty minutes. The maximum temperature was about 205 C. The same physical tests were conducted on the plaques thus obtained. The results are included in Table 1. EXAMPLE 2 The same pellets of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene as used in Example 1 which has gone through the sieving process in order to substantially remove the residual fine powders were fed to a commercial 25.4 mm 1 screw extruder. The screw had the compression ratio of 2.5. The extruder was operated without a die the barrel extension served as an extrusion die, and the land length was about 38 mm 1 1 2 . The operating condition was as follows front zone 3570C 6750F , center 3430C 6500F , rear 3430C 6500F , and melt temperature 3710C 7000F . The extruded product had a satisfactory quality. The original powder form UHMW PE could not be extruded with this set up. TABLE 1METHOD INJ. INJ. INJ. INJ. INJ. INJ.
