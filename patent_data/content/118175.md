# Road and engine speed governor control circuit.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to an engine and load speed governor 20 including an electronic control circuit 66 . The control circuit comprises engine speed signal generating circuit 24 and a load speed generating circuit to provide electrical speed signals to the input of a microprocessor. The microprocessor develops motor control signals for a reversi ble electric motor 62 which drive the actuator 64 for the throttle limiting device 36 . The motor control signals for operation in the close throttle direction and the open throttle direction are developed at different outputs of the microp rocessor and applied to respective inputs of a motor driver circuit 158 . The motor control signal produced by the microprocessor are time modulated, either pulse rate or pulde width, in accordance with the operating conditions of the engine or load to provide operation of the motor 62 at precisely controlled slow speeds. Unmodulated motor con trol signals are also produced by the microprocessor under certain operation conditions to provide operation of the motor at full speed.
