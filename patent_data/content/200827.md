# Control of AC power to inductive loads.

## Abstract
A control system is provided for controlling the average power from an alternating voltage source 10 to a load 14 having inductive properties. The system uses a syn chronous switch 16 shunted by a capacitor 20 connected between the source generator and sink load to pulse duration modulate the AC voltage carrier wave. A control signal generator circuit 19 drives the synchronous switch 16 such that the switch is closed at a variable time early in each half wave of the AC voltage source carrier wave and such that the switch is opened at a subsequent later, vari able time during that half wave. This is accomplished by sensing the voltage across the synchronous switch in order to inhibit closing of the switch early in the half wave until the synchronous switch voltage and thus the voltage on the capacitor is substantially zero and then opening the syn chronous switch at a point in time to give the desired volt second area between closure and opening within each half wave.
