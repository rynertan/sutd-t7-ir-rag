# Tape recorder head position controlling device.

## Abstract
A head position controlling device adjusts the position of the head 16 so as to maintain a prescribed position relative to a multi track magnetic tape 14 . The device includes a moving mechanism 24 , which moves the head 16 laterally across the magnetic tape 14 , and two tracking circuits 34,36 . During recording, a non contacting tape position detec tor 30,32 detects continuously the tape edge and controls the moving mechanism 24 by means of tracking circuit 36 . During play back, a tracking error signal from the reproduc ing head 28 controls the head position by means of tracking circuit 34 .
