# Change of distance measuring apparatus comprising a laser light source.

## Abstract
Change of distance measuring apparatus features a light transmitter receiver unit 23 which is used to sense the distance A to the surface of a measurement object 35 and more particularly to sense changes in the distance A occur ring due to changes in thickness of the measurement object 35 as it moves against a guide surface in the direction of the arrow F. The optical system features a front objective 14 which focusses a parallel beam of light received from a laser light source via beam widening optics 13 , 13 , a modal aperture 12 for limiting the beam to the zero order defrac tion image of the laser light source and a beam dividing mirror 33. Light returned from the surface of the measure ment object whether specularly reflected or scattered is gathered by the front objective 14 and is passed to a photo electric converter 19 via the dividing mirror 33, a further objective 16 and a second modal aperture stop 18. The signal at the photoelectric converter 19 is a maximum when the surface of the measurement object 35 is located in the desired plane 15. The position of the desired plane can be adjusted by optical means such as moving the front lens 14 and the extent of the movement required to maximize the signal at the photoelectric converter 19 is indicative of the change in the distance A. Various useful modifications are disclosed including the use of a comparison beam 36.
