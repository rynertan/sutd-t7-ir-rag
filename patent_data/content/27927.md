# Process for producing solid electrolyte primary cell.

## Abstract
A process for producing a solid electrolyte primary cell comprising a lithium anode and an iodine containing cathode. In the process the cell undergoes preliminary cell discharge of at least 2 mAh per cm² of the lithium anode surface immediately after its fabrication. Alterna tively, the cell may be stored at a relatively low temperature to undergo preliminary self discharge of at least 3 mAh per cm² of the anode surface.
