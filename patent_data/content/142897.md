# Magnetic tape cassette.

## Abstract
A magnetic tape cassette having a housing 1 compris ing two substantially parallel major walls 2, 3 , two substan tially parallel side walls 4, 5 , a rear wall 6 and a front wall 7 along which part of a magnetic tape 9 extends, is provided with a front cover 12 which comprises a major portion 13 which, in the closed position of said cover, covers the part of the magnetic tape 9 which extends along the front wall 7 , and cover flanges 14, 15 which extend along the front end portions of the side walls 4, 5 . The front cover 12 is pivotable from the closed position to two different open positions about an axis 16a which extends perpendicularly to the side walls 4, 5 . In the side facing the adjacent side wall 4, 5 each flange 14, 15 has a recess 21, 22 which extends arcuately about the pivotal axis 16a . The recesses 21, 22 in the flanges 14, 15 are so arranged that when projected onto a plane. , perpendicular to the pivotal axis 16a of the front cover 12 they are substantially mirror symmetrical relative to each other about a plane containing said pivotal axis and extending parallel to the major walls of the housing, and first end portions of the recesses 21, 22 overlap each other. There are also provided two spring loaded latching projections 19, 20 which are situated one near each of the side walls 4, 5 and which are movable into and out of the recesses 21, 22 in the cover flanges in directions perpendicular to these walls. In the closed position of the front cover 12 the latching projections 19, 20 are each situated in the first end portion of the recess 21, 22 in the adjacent cover flange and together retain the cover 12 in a latched position.
