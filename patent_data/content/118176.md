# CAVITY WALL TIE, METHOD AND CAVITY WALL CONSTRUCTION

## Abstract
A wall tie 10 for a timber frame cavity wall 19, 20 which is made as a generally flat rectangular stainless steel strip having first and second stiffening formations 12, 15 in the form of pressed ribs, separated by an unstiffened transverse junction 16 . The tie 10 can be bent about the junction 16 , to bring abutment faces 17, 18 of the stiffening formations 12, 15 into abutment and limit the angle through which the tie 10 is bent. In this condition, the tie is strong both in compression and in tension, while remaining flexible enough to permit differential movement of the inner and outer leaves 19, 20 of the wall. Chevron mortar keying formations 27 are formed on the other end portion 23 of the tie. A method and cavity wall construction are also described.
