## Description
Photocurable Dental Composition for Crown and Bridge PurposesThe present invention relates to improved dental compositions and particularly to photocurable dental compositions for crown and bridge purposes.In the long standing rivalry between ceramic and polymerizable compositions for preparing crowns and bridgework, the latter have receiv d increasing preference mostly because of reduced costs, easy processing and increased impact strength. For a long time the only practically feasible polymerization system was a heat polymerizable two component system, one component containing the polymerizable monomers and the other component containing the peroxide initiator.While such systems lead to polymerized end products with satisfactory properties, they must be marketed in the two component form, since a one component composition would have an intolerably short shelf life.Two component systems, however, are inflicted with numerous handling and processing disadvantages. Frequently the two components are not acurately measured, leading to less than optimum compositions. Further inhomogeneous products result from incomplete mixing or from the introduction of air bubbles during mixing. After mixing, the pot life is rather short, requiring rapid and skillful manipulation in building up the desired dental work, layer after layer. This difficulty leads often to the waste of material which has gone beyond the tolerable pot life. Finally the high temperature polymerization leads to shrinkage and undesirable gaps.If more reactive radical starters are used in a cold polymerization process, the pot life is intolerably short.For these reasons photopolymerizable one component compositions for crowns and bridges have been developped, which have a long shelf life. However, these compositions are inflicted with a dilemma. A sufficiently high impact strength of the end product is obtained only with compositions which have a rather low viscosity and which therefore require a large number of intermediate irradiations in the manufacturing of the crowns and bridges. On the other hand prior art compositions with a pasty consistency lead to an insufficient impact strength.Further, it has sometimes been observed that an increase in irradiation time leads to a decrease of the impact strength. On the other hand a sufficiently long and extensive irradiation is necessary in order to bring the polymerization process to completion. Otherwise, slow dark reactions will occur over a period of several days, accompanied by an equally slow change of color, usually toward lighter color tones. This makes the adjustment of precise color tones quite difficult.It is therefore a first object of the present invention to prepare a photopolymerizable dental composition for crown and bridge purposes which has a pasty consistency and which leads to products with a high impact strength. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a photopolymerizable dental composition for crown and bridge purposes which can be processed with relatively short irradiation times and which leads to products with high color stability. These and other objects are achieved with a photopolymerizable dental composition for crown and bridge purposes with a content of a polyfunctional meth acrylate and organic and or inorganic filler and a photoinitiator system, which is characterized in that the polyfunctional meth acrylate comprises a reaction product of a polyisocyanate and a diglycidyl meth acrylate of a bisphenol or oligomers thereof and a liquid polyfunctional meth acrylate for dissolving said reaction product.It has been found that the content of a reaction product of a polyisocyanate and a bis glycidyl meth acrylate of a bisphenol leads to high impact strength values even if the composition is adjusted for a pasty consistency.Further, the compositions may be cured with visible light in a relatively short period of time. A stable color tone is quickly reached and the product does not suffer slow color changes after the termination of the irradiation.Notably, the end products are color stable in water and in the mouth. Finally, the end products have a high abrasion resistence and they exhibit superior polishing characteristics.It is preferred to use as an inorganic filler a combination of pyrogenic silica and glass for an increased impact strength, bending strength and abrasion resistence. The photopolymerizable composition of the present invention contains a system of polyfunctional meth acrylates for establishing the polymer matrix. It comprises as a first essential component a reaction product of a polyisocyanate, preferably a diisocyanate and a diglycidyl meth acrylateof a bisphenol, preferably bisphenol A. Such reaction products are described in detail in US patent 3,629,187 and reference is made explicitly to this publication for disclosure purposes. Preferably the two reaction components are used in about a 1 1 molar ratio. In the following description this reaction product will be referred to briefly as NCO monomer.The liquid polyfunctional meth acrylate component may consist of one or several such polyfunctional meth acrylates.It is preferred to combine a dtmethpcrylate with a tri metjacrylate. The dmeth acrylate may be derived from ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, polyglycol 400, 1,3 propanediol, 1,4 butanediol, 1,6 hexanediol, 1 , 10 dodecanediol, 1,12 dodecanediol, 1,4 cyclohexanediol, 1,3 pentanediol, neopentylglycol, glycerol, pentaerythritol etc. Further, various dgnetgacrylates of bisphenol A derivatives may be used.The latter may be formally derived as a reaction product of bisphenol A and one or more molecules on either side of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, further a reaction product of hydroxyalkyl metnacrylate with a diisocyanate such as trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate orisophoronediisocyanate may be used.The trymetXacrylate may be derived from trimethylolpropane or from pentaerythritol, glycerol or 1,2,4 butanetriol, trimethylolethane, trimethylolmethane. Further, a tetr et crylate of a tetraol such as tetramethylolmethane or pentaerithritol may be used. The weight ratio of the NCO monomer to the liquid polyfunctional met crylate should be chosen so that the NCO monomer dissolves.Preferably, the weight ratio is in the range of from 0.05 1 to 5 1 and especially in the range of from 0.1 1 to 2 1 and more especially in the range of from 0.2 1 to 1.5 1. Tri, tetra and higher liquid met crylates may be absent. If they are present the weight ratio of the liquid d etW crylate to the liquid tri and higher methacrylate should be preferably above 0.1 1 and preferably 20 1 to 1 1 and more preferably 15 1 to 2 1.Next the photo initiator system shall be described. Usually a ketone and or the photo initiator is a combination otian a diketone and a reducing agent. It is most preferable to use camphoroquinone,since it provides the best results in cooperative relation to the NCO monomer. But other diketones may also be used such as biacetyl, benzyl or derivatives thereof, benzoin or derivatives thereof, fluorenone, a or ss naphthil or the like.Various types of reducing agents may be used. It is highly preferable to use a tertiary amine or its salt as reducing agent such asN,N diethanolmethylamine or triethanolamine or meth acrylates thereof. 2 DimethylaminoethyymetXacrylate and 3 dimethyl aminoneopentyymet crylate are preferred. It is most preferable to use a combination of such an amine and meth acrylic acid preferable at a molar ratio of about 1 1 , i.e. a salt of said amine with said acid. The latter two amines and particularly their methfcrylic acid salts are particular ly preferred since they exhibit a cooperative effect with camphoroquinone and theNCO monomer in terms of improved discoloration of the sensitizer and in terms of improved color stability of the product. It is however also possible to use other reducing agents such as the barbituric acid derivatives as described in German patent application 31 36 484, or sulfinic acids, sulfinates .r the like.The preparation of organic amine salts is described inEuropean Patent Application 84 102 448.2 The content of the ketone and or ketone t bases on the total com position is preferably within the range of from 0.0005 to 2 weight and more preferably 0.001to 0.8 weight . The content of the reducing agent or amine or amine salt is preferably in the range of from 0.01 to 5 weight and more preferably in the range of 0.03 to 3 weight based on the total composition.The composition of the present invention may contain one or several inorganic fillers and or one or several organic fillers. The weight ratio of the total amount of fillers to the total amount of monomers should be in the range of preferably 95 5 to 5 95 and especially 90 10 to 10 90. Most preferably the weight ratio of the fillers to the monomers is in the range of 1 0.4 to 1 and especially 1 0.5 to 0.9 .The filler composition may include a an inorganic filler or b an organic filler prepared from prepolymerized resin, which itself may contain n inorganic filler, or c a combination thereof. The inorganic filler may be silaned pyrogenic or precipitated silica and additionally alumina, titanium oxide, magnesium oxide, inorganic glass, quartz, sodium alumina silicate or any other customary inorganic filler.Preferably the filler composition contains a considerable amount of pyrogenic silica It is most preferable to use a highly disperse silanized pyrogenic silica as sold by Wacker HDK . This may have a variety of different BET surfaces and densities.It is particulary preferred to use silica with a BET surface of 170 m2 g and a bulk density of 90 g l. It is also possible to use an Aerosil Degussa . The BET surface is preferably in the range of from 10 to 400 and especially 2 in the range of from 50 to 300 m2 g. The filler composition should contain a total amount of silane treated pyrogenic silica of preferably 10 to 100 weight andiespecially 20 to 90 weight and most particularly of 30 to 80 weight . Of course different types of silane treated pyrogenic silica with different BET surface may be combined. Further, the filler composition may contain an organic filler.The filler composition may contain 0 to 100 of the organic filler and preferably 10 to 90 weight of the organic filler and especially 30 to 85 weight . The organic filler may be a cross linked polymer with or without a content of an inorganic filler. The organic filler without a content of an inorganic filler may be a polymethy metcrylate, which is cross linked with one of the di or polX et crylates mentioned above. Various other conventional types of such organic fillers may be also used.These organic fillers may be prepared with radical forming initiators under hot or cold conditions, whereby for example peroxides may be used or by photopolymerization under the usual conditions, for example with the above mentioned initiators, Preferably the organic filler contains an inorganic filler as mentioned above and notably a silane treated pyrogenic or precipitated silica, as mentioned above. The content of such inorganic filler should be in the range of from 10 to 90 weight and preferably 20 to 80 weight and especially 40 to 80 weight . It is particulary preferred to use an organic filler which has been prepared from a composition with a content of an NCO monomer and one of the other liquid polyfunctional meth acrylates as mentioned above.As tote possible and preferred types and ratios of the monomers reference is made to the explanations given above for the dental composition. Again these organic fillers may either be produced by using a peroxide catalyst or by photopolymerization under the abovementioned conditions. The organic filler may be a bead polymer or a fractured polymer.It should be noted, that there is a special cooperative effect between the NCO monomer and the pyrogenic silica, mentioned above and this cooperative or synergistic effect in terms of the desirablemechanical characteristics holds for the organic filler as well as for the dental composition and it is preferred to utilize this effect both with respect to the monomers and inorganic filler of the dental composition and the monomers and inorganic filler in the organic filler of the dental composition. Preferably, the dental composition contains glass as an additional inorganic filler. This glass may be partly or completely contained within the organic filler or the organic filler may be free of a glass content. In any event the amount of glass to the total amount of inorganic filler including the inorganic filler within the organic filler is in the range of up to 60 wt. , preferably 26 to 40 wt. E and most preferably 30 to 40 wt , based on the total amount of inorganic filler. The glass should have a refractory index close to that of the resin matrix for proper light transmissionIt is of particular advantage, that the photocurable dental composition may be given a pasty consistency. This consistency may be adjusted by the ratio of liquid monomers to the total amount of the inorganic filler, the organic filler and theNCO monomer.Further, the dental composition may contain various usual additives, for example inhibitors, for example p methoxyphenol and UV stabilizors, fluorescent materials, plasticizers, pigments and so forth.The dental composition may be used for preparing crowns, bridges and the like in the usual manner. It will not stick to the spatula and it may have a consistency which is most suitable for the required manipulations. The photopolymerization may be conducted in stages either for each layer or for several layers at a time or once for all layers. A curing depth of at least 2 mm is reached within 5 minutes. Visible light in the range of 350 to 700 nm especially 400 600 nm is preferred. The following non limiting examples further illustrate certain preferred embodiments of the invention. If not specified otherwise, g methacrylqxypropyl trimethoxy silane was used for silaning the inorganic fillers. The term NCO monomer whenever used in the examples refers actually to a mixture of 1 part by weight of triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate and 1 part by weight of a reaction product of 1 mole hexamethylene diisocyanate and 1 mole of a diestherof bisphenol A with glycidylmethacrylate. Example 1In a mixing vessel 30 g 1,4 butanedioldimethacrylate BDDMA and 10 g trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate TMPTMA were mixed,whereafter 0.7 g DL camphoroquinone, 2.0 g dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate DMAEMA and 1.2 g methacrylic acid MAA were dissolved under stirring. Further, the desired amount of fluorescent material, hydroquinone and so forth as well as the necessary pigments were added.Next 120 g of NCO monomerwere added, which had been previously prepared by reacting equimolar amounts of hexamethylenediisocyanate and bisphenol A glycidyl methacrylate.Further 100 g of a silane treated pyrogenic silica with a specific surface BET of about 170 m2 g and a bulk density of about 90 g l HDK H 2000, produced by Wacker were added.Finally, 100 g of an organic filler with a particle size of less than 100 micron wereladded. The organic filler had been prepared by polymerizing 99.2 weight methylmethacrylate and 0.8 ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate without an inorganic filler in the usual manner.This composition was thoroughly mixed. A pasty composition was obtained. It was used for preparing crowns and bridges by a standard build up technique, followed by irradiation with visible light for 7 minutes using a curing unit delivering more bhan 50 mW cm2 between 400 and 500 nm. Test samples were prepared in the same manner and evaluated according to DIN 53435. An impact strength of 1.2 kJ m2 was measured. The product was iree oi any yellow color due to the camphoroquinone and it did not suffer color changes, when tested according to DIN 13907.Comparative example 1E xample 1 was repeated with the exception that instead of the NCO monomer 120 g of a product obtained by reacting hydroxyethylmethacrylate and trimethylhexamethylenediiso cyanate in a molar.ratio of 2 1 Plex 6661,Roehm were used. After an irradiation of 7 minutes as before the impact strength was not higher than 0.4 kJ m2, when tested according toDIN 53435.Examples 2 and 3Example 1was repeated with the exception that BDDMAwas replaced by tetraethyleneglycoldimethacrylate TTEG or hexanedioldimethacrylate HD with similarly excellent results in terms of the impact strength, other mechanical properties and color stability.Example 4Example iwas repeated, whereby 80 g of the NCO monomer, 70 gHD and 10 g TMPTMAwere used as monomers together with 0.5 g pigments, 0.2 g camphoroquinone, 0.34 g methacrylic acid and 0.57 g DMAEMA. As inorganic filler 17 g HDRH 2000 was used together with 80 g of silaned Aerosil OX 50 Degussa with a BET surface of 50 12 g and a bulk density of about 80 g l and a primary particle size of about 40 nm. Further, 100 g of an organic fillerjwere used.The organic filletwas prepared by photopolymerization of a mixture of 0.13 camphoroguinone 0.22 methacrylic acid, 0.36 DMAEMA, 27.33 Plex 6661 0, 3.64 BDDMA and 86.32 of an Aerosil mixture consisting of 98. silanetreated Aerosil OX 50 and 2 Aerosil R 972. This polymer was aground to a particle size of less than 65 micron.Again excellent results in terms of impact strength, other mechanical properties and color quality and color stability were achieved.Example 5Example 4 was repeated except that HDwas replaced by 70 g of 1,12 dodecanediol dimethacrylate DD . Further, 0.1 g camphoroquinonewascombined with 0.3 g of the methacrylic acid salt of 3 dimethylamino neopentyl acrylate SH , prepared according to example 1 of European Patent Application 84 102 448.2Further, instead of the organic filler used in example 4 a different organic fillers used which was prepared by photopolymerization of a composition consisting of 0.06 weight camphoroquinonss 0.12 weight SH, 21.73 weight DD, 0.68 weight BDDMA and 77.41 weight of a mixture of silane treated Aerosil OX 50 99 weight and AerosilR 972 1 weight .Again excellent mechanical qualities including a high impact strengthwerecombined with a good color stability and an excellent color quality.Example 6Example 5was repeated, with the exception that 270 g of the organic filler of example 5 wereused as the sole filler material while 40 g of DD and 50 g of the NCO monomer were used as the sole monomers. Again excellent mechanical properties including a high impact strength and excellent color stability and color qualities were obtained. Example 7Example Swas repeated, whereby 35 g HD, 40 g NCO monomer and 5 g TMPTMA wereused as monomer mixture, combined with 0.3 g pigments, 0.15 g of camphoroquinoneand 0.6 g SH. A filler composition consisting of three fillers was used, namely 55.0 g of HDK H 2000 and 20 g of the Aerosil filler of example 5 and 50 g of an organic filler.The organic fillerwas prepared by photopolymerization of a composition of 0.056 camphoroquinon 0.111 SH, 0.997 TMPTMA and 29.95 NCO monomer, combined with 67.887 weight of an Aerosil filler consisting of 99 weight silane treated Aerosil OX 50 and 1 weight Aerosil R 972. Again an excellent dental composition with satisfactory mechanical and optical properties was obtained.Example 8Example 1 was repeated with 150 g of the NCO monomer, 10 g triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, 90 g HDK H 2000, silaned with 5 g methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane, 60 g silaned glass Schott glass P 8412, silaned with t methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane , 0.13g camphoroquinone, 0.63 g SH and 100 g of an organic filler containing the required pigment.
