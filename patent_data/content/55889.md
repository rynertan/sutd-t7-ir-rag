# Process and apparatus for time card preparation and utilization and the like.

## Abstract
This disclosure is concerned with presequencing machine readable time card identifications in the printing of decks of time cards, automatically using the time recording clock to fill in corresponding human readable identification, and with a corresponding map memory between machine and human readable identifications, enabling repetitive assignment of the machine readable identification of subse quent decks of time cards to provide complete use of the decks by changing such assignment correspondence.
