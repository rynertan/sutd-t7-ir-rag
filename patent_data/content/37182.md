# Preparation of a dried transition metal product.

## Abstract
A suspension which comprises an inert liquid medium, a solid material, and a transition metal compound is dried using a spray drying technique. The spray drying is effected under conditions of temperature and pressure which are such as to cause evaporation of the liquid medium. The solid material is preferably in a finely divided form. The solid material may consist essentially of a transisition metal compound or may be a transition metal compound which is supported on a suitable solid inert matrix material. Alterna tively, a suspension of a solid support material in a solution of a transition metal compound may be used. The dried solid is obtained as an agglomerate. The agglomerated solid can be mixed with an organic compound of a non transition metal to give an olefin polymerisation catalyst system.
