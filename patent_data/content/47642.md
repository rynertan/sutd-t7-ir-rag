# Fuel efficient energy storage automotive drive system and method of operation thereof.

## Abstract
A fuel saving energy storage vehicle drive system which saves fuel, primarily under stop and go driving conditions, by collecting, storing and using energy normally lost in the brak ing or deceleration of the vehicle utilizing hydraulic accumula tors 70 and a variable displacement hydraulic pump motor 42 selectively connected to a power transmission system 10 between the engine 12 and final drive assembly 14 , by automatically controlled operation of the engine including speed control and starting and stopping control under certain conditions, and by automatically controlled use of the stored energy and engine respectively as alternative or supplemental prime movers for each other for driving the vehicle, all control functions being directed by a microprocessor based central controller 80 . Subsystems for preventing waste of decelera tion energy and stored energy are provided, and compact transmission layout and packaging are provided which facili tate installation of the new system in existing vehicles.
