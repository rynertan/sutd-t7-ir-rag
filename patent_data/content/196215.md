# Recombinant surface antigens of swine mycoplasma and vaccines and diagnostics based on them.

## Abstract
Surface antigens of swine mycoplasma, such antigens prepared by recombinant DNA methods, a swine mycoplasma vaccine, based on such antigens, methods of treating swine to prevent enzootic pneumonia using that vaccine, and diagnos tic tests based on these antigens or antibodies raised against them for detecting the presence of swine mycoplasma infec tions in swine herds, and DNA sequences that code for such antigens are disclosed.
