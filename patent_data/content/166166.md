# Process for producing potassium hydroxide.

## Abstract
A process for producing potassium hydroxide by elec trolysis of potassium chloride in an electrolytic cell compris ing an anode compartment and a cathode compartment partitioned by a cation exchange membrane, which process comprises supplying potassium chloride to the anode com partment for the electrolysis to form potassium hydroxide in the cathode compartment, characterized in that said cation exchange membrane is a multi layer membrane comprising at least two layers including a main layer made of a per fluorocarbon polymer having carboxylic acid groups as its ion exchange groups with an ion exchange capacity of from 0.9 to 1.6 meq g dry resin and having a thickness of from 80 to 300 µm and a sulfonic acid film surface layer on the anode compartment side, made of a perfluorocarbon polymer having sulfonic acid groups as its ion exchange groups with an ion exchange capacity of from 0.5 to 1.5 meq g dry resin and having a thickness of from 5 to 50 µm.
