## Description
Opening Roof for a Motor Vehicle This invention relates to an opening roof assembly for a motor vehicle of the type comprising a rigid panel closing an opening in the vehicle roof and having front support means and separate rear support means for each side of the panel permitting the panel to pivot upwardly about a transverse horizontal axis adjacent to its front edge so that the rear edge of the panel is above the vehicle roof, each rear support means comprising a guide shoe arranged to be driven along a track extending parallel to the corresponding side edge of the opening and a lever which is pivotally connected at its front end to the panel and has a pivot formation at its rear end which engages with the corresponding guide shoe. Thus the panel can be opened by pivoting the panel upwardly about a transverse horizontal axis adjacent to its front edge so that the rear edge of the panel is above the vehicle roof. In a first kind of opening roof of this type, the roof can also be opened by sliding the panel rearwardly below the vehicle roof behind the opening, the panel being supported at each side by respective front and rear support means on respective guide rails extending along each side of an opening in the vehicle roof and behind said opening below the vehicle roof, and the front guide means being adapted to permit pivotal movement of the panel about a horizontal axis at right angles to the guide rails. In a second kind of roof of this type, the panel is secured to the front edge of the opening by hinges. An opening roof of the first kind is disclosed in ourEuropean Patent Application No. 84305314. Each rear support means comprises a guide shoe arranged to be driven along the corresponding guide track and connected to the roof panel by a chain of at least two links, each of the connections at the ends of the chain and between adjacent links thereof being arranged to permit relative angular movement over a limited range between an orientation such that adjacent links are in line with each other and parallel to the guide rail and an orientation such that adjacent links are at obtuse angles to each other and project above the guide rail. The present invention provides an opening roof assembly using a smaller number of parts for the rear support means. An opening roof of the second kind is disclosed in ourPatent Specification No. EP A 0010430. The rear suport means comprise a system of links which act as an over centre toggle to secure the panel in its closed position. Considerable force is necessary to operate the toggle mechanism. The present invention provides a mechanism in which the links hold the rear edge of the panel in its closed position without requiring such a large actuating force. According to the invention, in an opening roof assembly of this type, the pivot formation on the lever pivotally engages in a slot in a side wall of the corresponding guide shoe, and the lever has a stop formation which engages with a complementary formation on the shoe to limit downward angular movement of the front end of the lever about its rear end so that the panel is supported level with the vehicle roof when the pivot formation is at the rear end of the slot. When the invention is applied to an opening roof of the first kind, the front end of the slot is higher than its rear end, the panel being supported level with the vehicle roof when the pivot formation is at the rear end of the slot and moving below the level of the vehicle roof as the pivot formation moves forwardly along the slot. Preferably the rear end section of the slot in the rear shoe is parallel to the track so that the panel is level with the vehicle roof when the pivot formation is at any position in this rear section. Each front support means may comprise a front guide shoe, a support member secured to the panel and pivotally connected to the front shoe, a latch member pivotally mounted on the front shoe and having a latching formation which engages with a complementary formation on the track to prevent movement of the front shoe along the track, resilient means for biasing the latching formation into engagement with the complementary formation and release means on the support member arranged to move the latching formation out of engagement with the complementary formation as the rear edge of the panel is lowered below the vehicle roof. When the invention is applied to an opening roof of the second kind, the slot in a side wall thereof extends parallel to the track. With both kinds of roof, the lever may be provided with cam follower means arranged to engage with camming means on the rear shoe so as to hold the stop formation in engagement with the complementary formation except when the pivot formation is at the rear end of the slot. Thus the panel is prevented from rising above the level of the vehicle roof when the pivot formation is away from the rear end of the slot. On the other hand, continued forward movement of the rear shoe after the pivot formation has reached the rear end of the slot causes the lever to continue to pivot about its pivot formation, raising the rear edge of the panel. Additional camming means is preferably arranged to co operated with additional cam follower means so as to prevent forward movement of the pivot means along the slot when the panel is so raised. In a preferred form of invention, the additional cam follower means comprises a first cam follower located at the same distance from the pivot means as the stop means and a second cam follower between the pivot means and the first cam follower. The additional camming means comprises a first cam surface arranged to be engaged by the first cam follower when the extent to which the rear edge of the panel has been raised is less than a predetermined value, and a second cam surface arranged to engage with the second cam follower when this limit is exceeded. The stop formation for limiting angular movement of the front end of the lever may comprise a projection on one side of the lever, in which case the complementary formation on the shoe may comprise a slot in a side wall thereof. Alternatively, the stop formation may comprise a slot in the lever in which case the complementary formation comprises a pin secured to the shoe. At least that part of the slot or groove in which the pin is located when the rigid panel is level with the vehicle roof is parallel to the part of the slot in the guide shoe which is then occupied by the pivot formation at the rear end of the lever. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a fragmentary perspective sectional view of a motor car fitted with an opening roof assembly of the first kind to which the invention relates, showing the panel in its closed position and each of its two alternative open positions Figure 2 is a longitudinal sectional view of an opening roof assembly of the kind shown in Figure 1, in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention Figure 3 is an exploded view of one construction of the rear shoe and the parts connecting the rear shoe to the panel of the roof assembly shown in Figures 1 and 2 Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of the parts shown inFigure 3 with the panel in the closed position, as shown in Figure 2 Figure 5 is a cross sectional view, similar to Figure 4 but with the parts in the positions which they occupy when the rear edge of the panel is raised Figure 6 is a cross sectional view, similar to Figure 4 but with the parts in the positions which they occupy when the rear edge of the panel is lowered preparatory to sliding it under the vehicle roof Figure 7 is an exploded view, similar to Figure 3, of an alternative construction of the rear shoe and the parts connecting the rear shoe to the panel of the sliding roof assembly shown inFigures 1 and 2 Figure 8 is a cross sectional view of the parts shown inFigure 7 with the panel in the closed position, as shown in Figure 2 Figure 9 is a cross sectional view, similar to Figure 8 but with the parts in the positions which they occupy when the rear edge of the panel is partly raised shown in solid lines, and in the positions which they occupy when the panel is fully raised shown in chain dotted lines Figure 10 is a cross sectional view, similar to Figure 8 but with the parts in the positions which they occupy when the rear edge of the panel is lowered preparatory to sliding it under the vehicle roof Figures 11 and 12 are cross sectional views of an embodiment of the invention similar to that shown in Figures 3 to 6 but applied to an opening roof of the second kind, with the panel in the closed and open positions respectively Figures 13 and 14 are cross sectional views of an embodiment of the invention similar to that shown in Figures 7 to 10 but applied to an opening roof of the second kind, with the panel in the closed and open positions respectively Figure 15 is an exploded view of an alternative form of front shoe for use with the sliding roof assembly shown in Figures 1 and 2 the invention with the panel in the closed position Figure 16 is a cross sectional view of the parts shown inFigure 15 with the panel in the closed position, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 17 is a cross sectional view, similar to Figure 16 but with the parts in the positions which they occupy when the rear edge of the panel is lowered preparatory to sliding it under the vehicle roof. Figure 1 shows the upper part of the body of a saloon motor car comprising a bonnet 10, a windscreen 12, a roof 14, a rear window 16 and a boot 18. A movable glass roof panel 20 is located in a frame 22 bounding an opening in the vehicle roof and including a drain tray 24 forming the bottom of a chamber into which the roof panel 20 can be slid below the vehicle roof 14. A respective guide track, on which the panel 20 is slidable, extends along each side of the opening in the vehicle roof 14 and into the space above the drain tray 24. Figure 2 shows the track 26 on the car driver s right hand side of the opening in the vehicle roof 14, in longitudinal cross section. The track consists of a generally U shaped channel, the side walls of which have respective inwardly directed flanges 28 extending along substantially the whole length thereof. The front end of the panel 20 is supported on the track 26 by a front shoe 32 which is moulded integrally with a support member 34 secured to the lower surface of the panel 20. The support member 34 is connected to the front shoe 32 by an integral hinge formation 36. A stop member 37, mounted on the track 26, has a rearwardly projecting finger 38 which engages in a recess 39 in the shoe 32.The recess 39 is shaped so that the finger 38 can be withdrawn only when rear edge of the panel 20 is lowered. The front shoe 32 also has formations not shown which engage under the flange 28 of the guide rail 26. At the rear edge of the panel 20, a rear guide shoe 40 is located in the guide rail 26 and connected by a flexible plastic tape 42 to drive means not shown . As can be seen from Figures 3 and 4, the rear shoe 40 is of U shaped cross section, having side walls 44 and 46 which extend upwardly between the flanges 28 of the track, and shoulders 48 and 50 which engage thereunder. Each of the side walls 44 and 46 contains a respective slot 52 and 54, the two slots being aligned with one another and each having horizontal rear sections and upwardly inclined front sections. Referring again to Figure 2, a respective bracket 60 is secured to the underside of the panel 20, near the rear edge thereof and above each of the tracks 26. As can best be seen from Figure 3, the bottom end of the bracket 60 is bifurcated and each of its limbs has a respective hole 64 for receiving the ends of a pin 66 which extends through one end of a lever 68. A second pin 70 extends through the other end of the lever 68 and is received in the slots 52 and 54. Approximately midway betwen the pins 56 and 70, the lever 68 has a projection 72 facing the side limb 44 of the rear shoe 40.The projection 72 has an arcuate surface 74 centred on the pin 70.The limb 44 of the shoe 40 has a first cam formation 76, the rear surface 78 of which is a concave arcuate surface of slightly larger radius than that of the surface 74 and centred on the pin 70 when the latter is in abutment with the rear ends of the slots 52 and 54.The cam formation 76 also has a bottom surface 80 which is spaced from the bottom of the channel formed between the two limbs 44 and 46 by a distance slightly greater than the height of the projection 72. The projection 72 has rounded top and bottom surfaces so as to permit limited angular movement of the lever 68 about the projection 72, with the latter in the space between the surface 80 and the bottom of the channel, as will be explained hereinafter. When the lever 68 is in the position illustrated in Figure 4, with the pin 70 displaced from the rear end of the slots 52 and 54, it can freely slide forwardly and rearwardly relative to the shoe 40 but cannot pivot about the pin 70 in either direction. If the pin 70 is slid into abutment with the rear ends of the slots 52 and 54, as illustrated in Figure 5, the projection 72 clears the rear end of the cam formation 40, allowing the lever 68 to pivot upwardly about the pin 70, engagement of the arcuate surface 74 of the projection 72 with the arcuate surface 78 of the cam formation 76 preventing forward movement of the pin 70 along the slots 52 and 54 while the lever 68 is raised.Before the bottom edge of the arcuate surface 74 has cleared the top edge of the arcuate surface 78, a second arcuate surface 82, formed on a thickened portion of the lever 68 adjacent to the pivot pin 70, engages with a complementary arcuate surface 84 on a second camming formation 86 on the side limb 44, as can be seen in Figure 5. Referring now to Figure 6, if, with the lever 68 initially in the position shown in Figure 4, the pin 70 slides along the slots 52 and 54 to the front ends thereof, the lever 68 pivots about the bottom edge of the projection 72 as the pin 70 moves further up the inclined parts of the slots 52 and 54. This brings the bottom of the bracket 60 below the level of the flange 28. The bifurcated limbs of the brackets 60 have outwardly extending projections 90 and 92, the extremities of which are more widely spaced than the gap between the flanges 28. However, the flanges 28 have respective gaps 94 aligned with the brackets 60 when the panel 20 is aligned with the opening in the vehicle roof. These gaps 94 permit the projections 90 and 92 to pass the flanges 28. The operation of the roof illustrated in Figures 1 to 6 is as follows. When the panel 20 is in its closed position illustrated in Figure 2, the lever 68 is in the position illustrated in Figure 4 with the pin 70 at an intermediate position along the length of the horizontal parts of the slots 52 and 54. when the roof is to be opened by raising its rear edge, the rear shoe 40 is moved forwardly by means of the tape 42, displacing the pin 70 to the rear ends of the slots 52 and 54.Forward movement of the panel 20 is resisted by the engagement of the finger 38 in the recess 39 at the front of the track 26 but, since the pin 66 is above the pin 70, the result of continued forward movement of the shoe 40 is to displace the pin 66 upwardly, this movement being possible because the front surface of the projection 72 on the lever 68 is now clear of the rear surface 78 of the camming formation 76. Forward movement continues until the lever 68 has rotated to the angle illustrated in Figure 5 which is the fully raised position. The roof can be closed again by moving the rear shoe 40 backwardly to the position illustrated inFigure 4. On the other hand, when the panel 20 is to be slid below the vehicle roof 14, the rear shoe 40 is moved rearwardly from the position illustrated in Figure 4. As soon as the pin 70 reaches the front end of the horizontal parts of the slots 52 and 54, the lever 68 starts to pivot downardly towards the orientation illustrated inFigure 6. Because the bracket 60 is aligned with the gap 94 in the flanges 28, this downward movement is not obstructed. Further rearward movement of the shoes 40 moves the bracket 60 rearwardly out of alignment with this gap 94, the finger 38 disengaging from the recess 39 at the front of the panel 20 which is opened to the extent desired. It should be appreciated that, as can be seen fromFigure 2, the distance between the bottom of the track 26 and the vehicle roof 14 is greater at the rear of the opening than at the front. Consequently, no special action is necessary to lower the front of the panel 20 before it slides under the vehicle roof 14. When the panel is to be moved back to its closed position, the rear shoes 40 are slid forwardly again, engagement of the projections 90 and 92 under the flanges 28 preventing upward movement of the panel 20 until it is aligned with the opening in the vehicle roof. When the finger 38 is again received in the recess 39, further forward movement of the rear shoes 40 causes the pin 70 to travel backwardly along the slots 52 and 54, raising the rear edge of the panel 20 until it is level with the vehicle roof 14. The horizontal sections of the slots 52 and 54 provide a range of positions for the rear shoes 40 in which the panel 20 remains in its closed position level with the vehicle roof 14. The lengths of these horizontal sections is chosen in accordance with the accuracy with which the operating mechanism can stop the rear shoes 40 in a selected position. Turning now to Figures 7 to 10, the bracket 60 and the track 26 are similar to that already described and will not be described again in detail. However, the rear guide shoe 40 is replaced by a rear guide shoe 100 having side walls 102 and 104 containing slots 52 and 54 similar to the side walls 44 and 46 of Figure 3. The lever 68 is replaced by a lever 108, the rear end of which carries a pin 70 which engages in the slots 52 and 54, as before. The side wall 104 also has an inwardly extending projection 110 having a concave arcuate surface 112 which cooperates with a convex arcuate surface 114 on the lever 108 in a similar manner to the surfaces 82 and 84 of Figures 3 to 6 although the precise location of the surface 112 is somewhat different.Similarly, at its front end, the lever 108 has an arcuate surface 116 which cooperates with a corresponding concave arcuate surface 118 on a projection 120 at the front end of the side wall 104 in a similar manner to the arcuate surfaces 74 and 78 of Figures 3 to 6. However, in place of the rounded bottom surface of the projection 72, the lever 108 has an open ended slot with a straight front open end 122 and an arcuate rear or inner end 124. A pin 126 extends between the side walls 102 and 104 and can be engaged by the open ended slot comprising the sections 122 and 124 as can best be seen in Figures 8 and 10. Referring now specifically to Figure 7, when the panel 20 is in its normal closed position level with the vehicle roof 14, the pin 126 is received in the straight section 122 of the slot in the lever 108 while the pin 70 is in the horizontal rearmost sections of the slots 52 and 54. At this stage, the section 122 of the slot in the lever 108 is also horizontal, with the result that small horizontal movements of the shoe 100 relative to the lever 108 have no effect on the vertical position of the rear edge of the panel 20.In other words, the precise position of the shoe 110 along the track 26 is not critical. If the shoe 100 is moved forwardly along the track 26 to bring the pin 70 into engagement with the rear end of the slots 52 and 54, the pin 126 disengages from the front end of the slot section 122. Further forward movement of the shoe 100 causes the lever 108 to pivot about the pin 70, raising the rear edge of the panel 20, as illustrated in Figure 9. The arcuate surfaces 118 and 122 prevent movement of the pin 70 forwardly along the slots 52 and 54 while the panel is raised to the extent illustrated in solid lines in Figure 9, while the arcuate surfaces 112 and 114 prevent such movement when the panel is raised to a greater extend, as illustrated in chain dotted lines in Figure 9. When the panel 20 is to slide under the vehicle roof 14, the shoe 100 is moved rearwardly, sliding the pin 70 to the front end of the slots 52 and 54 and the pin 126 to the inner end of the arcuate section 124 of the slot in the lever 108, thus lowering the rear edge of the panel, as illustrated in Figure 10. The panel 20 is now clear to slide rearwardly. Figures 11 and 12 illustrate an embodiment of the invention similar to that illustrated in Figures 3 to 6, but applicable to an opening roof of the second kind described above, that is of the type in which the panel is hinged along the front edge of the vehicle roof opening and movable between a closed position level with the vehicle roof and an open position in which its rear edge is raised above the level of the vehicle roof. Most of the components are identical with those illustrated in Figures 3 to 6 and, being denoted with the same reference numerals, will not be described again in detail. The only difference is that the slots 52 and 54 ofFigures 3 to 6 are replaced by slots 130 which extend parallel to the track 26 and are of approximately the same length as the horizontal sections of the slots 52 and 54.When the roof is in the closed position, as illustrated in Figure 11, the pin 70 is located forwardly of the rear end of the slot 130 and the projection 72 is retained between the surface 80 and the bottom of the rear shoe 26 so that the panel is held level with the vehicle roof. If the shoe 26 is then moved forwardly along the track to bring the pin 70 to the rear end of the slot 130, the lever 68 is free to pivot upwardly about the pin 70 and further forward movement of the shoe 26 causes such angular movement of the lever 68, raising the rear edge of the panel. Figures 13 and 14 illustrate the application of the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figures 7 to 10 to an opening roof of the second kind. As with the embodiment illustrated in Figures 11 and 12, the slots 52 and 54 in the rear shoe 100 are replaced by horizontal slots 132 similar to the slots 130 of Figures 11 and 12. In addition, the slot 134 in the lever 108 is of the same length as the straight section 122 of the slot illustrated inFigures 7 to 10. Operation of this embodiment is similar to that of the embodiment illustrated in Figures 11 and 12. Figures 15 to 17 illustrate an alternative construction for the front support means of an opening roof of the first kind, suitable for use either with rear support means as illustrated inFigures 3 to 6 or as illustrated in Figures 7 to 10. Referring particularly to Figure 15 and 16, a respective front shoe 140 for each side of the panel has side walls 142 and 144 which extend upwardly between the flanges 28 of the track and shoulders 146 and 148 which engage thereunder. The side walls 142 and 144 project beyond the base 150 of the front shoe 140 in the forward direction while the base 150 projects beyond the side walls 142 and 144 in the rearward direction. The thickness of the base 150 is approximately half the height of the shoulders 146 and 148. A support member 152, to which the panel 20 is secured has a pivot pin 154 near its front end which is journaled in holes 156 and 158 in the front ends of the side walls 142 and 144 respectively. A latch member 160 is located between the rear half of the support member 152 and the base portion 150. At its front end, the latch member 160 has a pivot pin 162 which is journaled in holes 164 and 166 in the rear ends of the side walls 142 and 144 respectively. At its rear end, the latch member has a respective latching projection on each side, each projection having a front portion 168, of thickness slightly less than the difference between the height of the shoulders 146 and 148 and the thickness of the base portion 150 of the front shoe 140, and a back portion 170 of approximately half the thickness of the front portion 168.The support member 152 has a downwardly projecting nose 172 on its rear end which can engage with the upper surface of the latch member 160. A compression spring 174 is located on a peg 176 on the base member 150 and accommodated in a recess 178 in the latch member 160 so as to bias the rear end of the latter in the upward direction. When the panel 20 is in its closed position level with the vehicle roof 14 as illustrated in Figure 16, the nose 172 on the support member 152 is out of engagement with the top of the latch member 160, the rear end of which is therefore urged upwardly by the spring 174. The thicker parts 168 of each of the latching projections engaged in gaps not shown in the flanges 28 similar to the gaps 94 at the rear end of the roof opening see Figures 2 and 4 , thus preventing rearward movement of the front shoes 140. The thinner parts 170 of the latching projections engage under the flanges 28 behind these gaps, thus limiting upward movement of the rear end of the latch member 160.When the rear edge of the panel is to be raised, as shown in Figures 5 and 9 for example, the support member 152 pivots on its pivot pin 154 in an anti clockwise direction and the latch member 160 remains in the position illustrated in Figure 16, with the thicker portions 168 of the latching projections remaining in engagement with the slots in the flanges 28. When the rear edge of the panel 20 is lowered, prior to sliding it under the vehicle roof 14, i.e. when the rear support means is in the position illustrated in Figures 6 and 10, the support member 152 pivots in the clockwise direction to the position illustrated in Figure 17 in which the nose 172 presses downwardly on the top of the latch member 160 so as to compress the spring 174 and disengage the thicker portions 168 of the latching projections from the slots in the flanges 28. The front shoes 140 are then free to slide along the track 26.
