# Frequency multiplexed optical spatial filter.

## Abstract
A frequency multiplexed optical spatial filter comprises a thin film of a photochemical hole burning material. The filter stores a plurality of images in the photochemical hole burning medium. The images are formed at different optical frequencies and coexist in the same volume of the storage medium. Individual images are accessed by changing the frequency of the illuminating radiation.
