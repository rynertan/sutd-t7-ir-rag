# Water treatment system and control therefor.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a water treatment system which includes a water treatment tank 20 containing a resin bed 22 through which water is passed for treatment thereof during normal operation of the treatment system. A brine tank 24 contains a brine solution 26 which, when passed through the resin bed, results in regeneration of the treatment effectiveness of the bed. A plurality of electrically actuatable valves 28,30 direct water through the treatment tank during normal operation of the treatment system and direct brine solution through the treatment tank in a regeneration operation. A control for the water treatment system includes switches S1 to S5 for manually entering control data, a display 98 for displaying data, and a sensor 31 for sensing the volume of water treated by the water treatment system. A controller circuit Figure 2 is responsive to the switches S1 to S5 and to the sensor 31 and is connected to display data on the display 98 . The controller circuit provides electrical control signals to the plurality of electrically actuatable valves. The sequence, duration, and time of occurrence of the electrical control signals is determined by the control data entered through the switches.
