# Aluminum transition metal alloys having high strength at elevated temperatures.

## Abstract
The invention provides an aluminum based alloy con sisting essentially of the formula Al The invention also provides a method and apparatus for forming rapidly solidified metal, such as the metal alloys of the invention, within an ambient atmosphere. Generally stated, the apparatus includes a moving casting surface which has a quenching region for solidifying molten metal thereon. A reservoir holds molten metal and has orifice means for depositing a stream of molten metal onto the casting surface quenching region. A heat mechanism heats the molten metal contained within the reservoir, and a gas source provides a non reactive gas atmosphere at the quenching region to minimize oxidation of the deposited metal. A conditioning mechanism disrupts a moving gas boundary layer carried along by the moving casting surface to minimize disturbances of the molten metal stream that would inhibit quenching of the molten metal on the casting surface at a quench rate of at least about 10‚Å∂ C sec. Particles composed of the alloys of the invention can be heated in a vacuum and compacted to form a consolidated metal article have high strength and good ductility at both room temperature and at elevated temperatures of about 350 C. The consolidated article is composed of an aluminum solid solution phase containing a substantially uniform distribution of dispersed intermetallic phase precipitates therein. These precipitates are fine intermetallics measuring less than about 100 nm in all dimensions thereof.
