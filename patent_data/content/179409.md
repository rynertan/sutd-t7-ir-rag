## Description
POLDABLE CHAIR STRUCTURE INCOHPORATIG A SAFETY DEVICE This invention relates to afoldable chair structure incorporating a safety device. As is known, currently available on the market are foldable chairs which comprise essentially a seat frame extending in a closed loop, to the sides whereof the chair a front legs and rear legs are pivotally connected. To extensions of the front legs, armrests are pivoted which are, in turn, connected pivotally to a middle portion of the backrest frame, the latter being pivoted on extensions of the rear legs. Also provided are braces connecting a point of the backrest frame to the pivotal connection area between the seat frame and front legs. The seat and backrest are defined by a fabric or plastics sheet which is connected with its middle portion to springs associated with the rear portion of the seat frame. Such prior foldable chairs have the advantage that they can be reduced to a very compact folded size, since the front and rear legs can be folded down, to an interleaved condition, against the seat frame while, by virtue of the above described linkages, the backrest frame can likewise be brought to overlie the seat frame. These types of foldable chair have SholRrLtobe quite convenient and functional but are liable to accidentally collapse, with obvious potential hazard for their users, if handled improperlg, and typically if a force is exerted on a front leg tending to cause the rear legs to swing in to a folded condition of the chair as the user generally applies her full weight to the front portion of the chair and the chair only rests on its front legs. It is the aim of this invention to obviate the above mentjoned hazardous situation by providing a folding chair structure which incorporates a device effective to prevent the chair from collapsing unintentionally. Within the above aim, it is a particular object of the invention to provide a foldable chair structure incor porating a safety device for preventing it from accidentally collapsing which is of simplified construction such that it introduces no constructional complications of sort. Another object of this invention is to provide a foldable chair structure incorporating a safety device , which owing to its peculiar construction, can give full assurance of being reliable and safe to use. A not least object of the invention is to provide a foldable chair structure incorporating a safety device, which can be readily manufactured from commercially available elements and materials and be highly competitive from a purely economical standpoint. The above aim, and these and other objects to become apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a ibldable chair structure incorporating a safety device, according to the invention, comprising a closed loop seat frame to the sides whereof there are pivotaily connected front and rear legs, eatensl 0n8 of s d front legs being pivotally connected to armressts, pivoted at the other ends thereof to a middle portion of a backrest frame, said backrest frame being connected pivotally to extensions of said rear legs, characterized in that it comprises locking means effective to prevent the chair from accidental ly collapsing and including at least one oscillable plate journalled to a middle portion of said backrest frame and releasably engageable by contact with the free ends of the rear leg extensions to prevent pivoting to a folded condition. Further featurea and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed descrip tion of a foldable chair structure incorporating a safety device, to be read in conjunction with the accompanying illustrative and not limitative drawings, where Figure 1 is a perspective, schematic view of a foldable chair structure according to the invention Figure 2 is a top plan view of the foldable chair structure, shown in its unfolded in use condition Figure 3 is a side view of the foldable chair structure of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a fragmentary side elevation view of the foldable chair structure showing in detail the locking means associated therewith, in a locked condition thereof Figure 5 is a further detail view similar to the view of Figure 4, illustrating the release phase of the locking means to allow the chair to be folded Figure 6 is a perspective detail view from one side of the plate forming the locking means Figure 7 ia a perspective view of the other side of the plate of Figure 6 Figure 8 ia a side elevation view showing in detail the locking means as mounted to the inward elide of the chair connecting brace Figure 9 is a top plan view of the plate ofFigure 8 and Figure 10 is a perspective view of the plate ofFigure 8. With reference to the drawing figures, a foldable chair structure incorporating a safety device, according to the invention, comprises a seat frame, generally designated with the reference numeral 1, which is preferably a closed loop design of substantially quadrangular con figuration, including two substantially parallel lateral portions la, ib forwardly interconnected by a front piece 1C, and rearwardly interconnected by a rear portion 1d lying substantially parallel thereto. At the front of the lateral portions la, ib of the seat, outwardly of the frame, there are pivoted the front legs 2a, 2b which, as is usual, comprise a tubular member folded to a substantially U like configuration and defining a floor resting zone at an interconnection section 3, extending between said front legs 2a, 2b. Inwardly of the seat frame 1, rearwardly at the lateral portions la, ib thereof there are pivoted the rear legs 4a, 4b also formed from a bent tubular member defining a substantially U like configuration, which further defines a floor resting zone at i ss interconnecting section 5 extending between said rear legs 4a, 4b. The upward extensions 7 of the front legs 2 are journalled at their uppermost ends to the anterior portions of substantially horizontal armrests 8 whicb are pivoted, at their rear ende, to the upright members 9a, 9b of the backrest frame, generally indicated at 10, which defines an inverted U like member ncl lding a substantially horizontal portion 9c extending between the upper ends of the upright members 9. At their bottom ends, the uprights 9 are Journalled proximately to the upper extremities of the extensions 11 of the rear legs 4. Also provided is a connecting brace 15, formed preferably from plastics or other such suitable material, which is connected at its forward portion 15a between the point of pivotal connection of the front legs 2 to the seat frame 1 and at its rear portion 15b to a middle portion of the uprights 9 at the area thereof extending between the pivotal connection of the armrests 8 to the e rtenstons 11 of the rear legs 9a, 9b. Obviously, all of the cited connections between elements of the chair s frame may be achieved by the utilization of any suitable pivotal connection means such as rivets, nuts and bolts, upturned pine etc. The chair is then completed by partially covering the chair frame with a sheet, generally indicated at 16, which extends from the front piece ic of the seat frame 1 to the horizontal portion 9e extending between the uprights 9 to define the seat 18 and backrest 19 and is connected, at the area Joining the seat to the baokrest, to springs 20 connected to the rear portion ld of the seat frame 1. The peculiar aspect of the invention is that locking means are provided to prevent the chair from accidentally collapsing the locking means comprise an oscillable plate, indicated at 30, which is expediently Journalled at a first end portion 30a thereof including a through hole 30b to the upright 9 at the area of pivotal connection to the brace 15 Figure 5 . That plate 30 has at a second end portion 30c thereof, a seat 31 which is adapted to engage with the free ends of the extension 11 of the rear legs, ao as to form an abutment effective to prevent the chair from being folded down. Thus, in order to be able to fold the chair, the plate 30 must be removed from its position of engagement and specifically the extension 11 must be released from its engagement with the abutment seat 31, before the rear leg can be pivoted in order to fold the chair. To this end, it will be sufficient to turn the chair upside down, thereupon the plate 30 will swing by gravity away from the extension 11 thereby uncoupling the engagement between the end of the extension 11 and the seat 31 and thus allowing the chair to be folded down. To permit accurate positioning of the plate 30, means are advantageously provided which are adapted to delimit the upward pivotal movement of the plate 30 comprising a side lug 35 which is expediently fortes integrally with the plate 30, protruding laterally therefrom such that it engages in abutment engagement relationship with the brace 15, to prevent the plate from pivotally moving downwardly below the same, a projection 36 is also expediently provided which ie also advantageously formed integral with the plate 30, protruding laterally therefrom at a side opposite to said side lug 35, thereby the proJection 36 engages by contact with the uprights 9. Thus, in this example, wherein the side lug 35 and proJection 36 proJect from opposite sides of the plate 30, the plate 30 would be placed between the upright 9 and the brace 15. However, as shown in Figure 8, a plate 40 could be alternatively provided inwardly of the brace 15. In this case, the locking means preventing the plate from turning accidentally upward would comprise a bottom extension or protuberance 41 which is adapted to engage with the bottom portion of the brace 15, and the means preventing the plate 40 from turning downward would comprise a top extension or protuberance 42, expediently positioned proiimately to the pivotal connection area or through hole 40a and being adapted for abutment engagement with the top portion of the brace 15, the bottom protuberance 41 and the top protuberance 42 both projecting laterally from the same side of the plate 40. Furthermore, the plate 40 may be provided with a plurality of detents such as a first detent seat 45 and a second detent seat 46, Figure 10 , which are selectively engageable with the free ends of the extensions to provide different angular inclinations of the chair back 19 with respect to the seat 18 with the chair in its open condition. The folding chair of this invention is designed such that, when in the open condition, the plate, 30 or 40, will be caused by gravity to abut with its free end against the free end of the extension 11, thereby any force acting in the chair folding direction would be resisted, since the rear legs are prevented from pivoting due to the engagement of the seat 31 or abutment detent 45,46 with the cited free end of the extension 11, Figure 4 . To fold the chair down, it will be sufficient to turn the chair upside down Figure 5 , whereupon the plate will swing away from the end of the rear leg extension 11 by gravity, thus permitting the rear legs free to oscillate to the position assumed in the folded condition of the chair. It should be further added that these means which delimit the free pivotal movement of the plate in an upward or downward direction have the function of pre venting the plate from assuming an improper setting such that it cannot freely swing to its automatically locked position on unfolding the chair. It may be appreciated from the foregoing descrip tion that the invention achieves its objects, and in particular it should be stressed that through very simple means, such as those including the plate Journalled to the upright at the area of pivotal connection of the connecting brace, a high degree of safety is imparted to the chair, which can no longer accidentally fold down. Another important aspect is that the plate mounting involves no special processing, since the plate is installed at a pivotal point of connection which is already conventionally provided on chairs Of this type. In practicing the invention, any materials, contingent shapes and dimensions may be used, 80 long as compatible with the specific application.
