# METHOD OF PRODUCING HAIRLESS PIGS

## Abstract
Genetic manipulation techniques involving the use of a bacteriophage are employed to alter the genetic structure and form a no hair gene. Pigs resulting from the union of no hair gene pigs are hairless or have just patches of fuzzy hair . The no hair strain can reproduce itself, and the method can be used to produce hairless strains of the various established breeds. Such pigs have wide utility in many commercial and industrial fields, as well as in research and testing procedures involving substances or properties which are new and are or may be hazardous to life.
