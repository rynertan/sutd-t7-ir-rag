## Description
Title Spirobenzofuranone Compounds This invention relates to spiro compounds having a novel skeletal structure, which are of use as medicines and as intermediates for the production of medicines. The invention also relates to methods of producing these novel spiro compounds. More particularly, this invention relates to novel sniro compounds of the formula EMI1.1 wherein Ring A represents a benzene ring or a naphthalene ring, the ring being unsubstituted or substituted by at least one of lower alkyl, nitro, halogen, amino, which may optionally itself be substituted, hydroxyl which may optionally itself be substituted, acyl and sulphamoyl, and to methods of producing these novel spiro compounds. The optional substituents of Ring A as defined above are now described in detail. Examples of the lower alkyl group include alkyl grips of 1 to 6 carbon atoms e.g. methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec. butyl, tert. butyl, n pentyl, iso pentyl, n hexyl, 2 methylpentyl or 2 ethylbutyl . The halogen may be chlorine, bromine, fluorine or iodine. Examples of the amino group, which may optionally be substituted, include amino, mono or di alkylamino, acylamino, sulphonylamino and cycloamino. The monoor dialkylamino group may be amino which is monoor di substituted by alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as e.g., methylamino, ethylamino, npropylamino, iso propylamino, n butylamino, dimethylamino, diethylamino, di n propylamino or methylethylamino. The acylamino group may, for example, be alkanoylamino containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms e.g. acetylamino, propionylamino, n butyrylamino or iso butyrylamino . The sulphonylamino group may, for example, be alkanesulphonylamino containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms e.g. methanesulphonylamino or ethanesulphonylamino .As the cycloamino group, there may be mentioned 5or 6 membered cycloamino groups which may contain N or 0, for example, pyrrolidinyl, piperidino, piperazinyl or morpholino. The piperazinyl group may have a substitutent at the nitrogen atom of its 4 position, such as an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms e.g.methyl or ethyl , a phenyl Cl 4 alkyl group e.g.benzyl or an alkanoyl group containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms e.g. acetyl or propionyl . As examples of the hydroxyl group which may optionally be substituted, there may be mentioned hydroxyl, alkoxy, aralkyloxy or acyloxy. The alkoxy group preferably contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms e.g.methoxy, ethoxy, n propoxy, iso propoxy, n butoxy, isobutoxy, sec. butoxy or tert. butoxy , and the alkoxy group may be further substituted, for example, by monoor di alkylamino groups e.g. methylamino, ethylamino, dimethylamino or diethylamino . The aralkyloxy group may, for example, be a phenyl Cl 4 alkyloxy group e.g. benzyloxy or phenethyloxy . The acyloxy group is preferably an alkanoyloxy group containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms e.g. acetyloxy, propionyloxy, n butyryloxy or iso butyryloxy , or benzoyloxy group, for instance. The acryl groups may, for example, be an alkanoyl group of 2 to 6 carbon atoms e.g. acetyl, propionyl, n butyl3 1 or iso butyryl or benzoyl. The substituents of Ring A up to 4 at a maximum may be present in various substitutable positions onRing A, and may be the same or different. When A is benzine, the A Ring is preferably substituted at its 5 or 6 position the 5 position is the more desirable , by an amino group which may optionally be substituted especially a mono or di Cl 4 alkylamino group , or by an acyl group especially a C24 alkanoyl group . The spiro compound I of the present invention may be produced, for instance by, decarboxylating a compound of the formula EMI3.1 wherein Ring A is as defined hereinbefore. This reaction is normally carried out in the presence of a catalyst which assists in the decarboxylation. Among preferred catalysts for this purpose are metal halides e.g. sodium chloride, sodium bromide, sodium iodide, potassium bromide, potassium chloride or potassium iodide . and quaternary ammonium salts e.g. tetramethyl ammonium bromide . The reaction temperature is normally from 1000C to 2000 C, and preferably from 1400C to 1600C, although the reaction may be conducted at higher or lower temperatures if it is desired to control the reaction velocity. Purging the reaction vessel with an inert gas e.g. N2 or argon is sometimes effective in preventing side reactions and improving yields. This reaction is normally carried out in a suitable solvent.While any solvent that will not interfere with the reaction may be employed, it is normally advantageous to employ a solvent having a boiling point higher than the reaction temperature e.g. dimethyl sulphoxide, N,Ndimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphoramide . Among the spiro compound I of this invention, those having a substituent or substitutents on Ring A can also be produced by subjecting a compound I wherein Ring A is unsubstituted, or a compound I having at least one hydrogen atom on its Ring A, to a per se conventional alkylation, nitration, halogenation or acylation, depending on the kinds of the then intended substituents. A compound I wherein the substitutent s on Ring A is are an amino group s can be produced also by subjecting a compound I wherein the position s to which an amino group s is are to be introduced is are occupied by a hydrogen atom s , to a nitration reaction and, then to a reduction reaction such as catalytic reduction reaction. Further, it is also possible to replace the substituent s on Ring A of a compound I with other substituent s by reactions known per se. Thus, a compound I wherein the substituent s is are monoor di alkylamino group s can be produced by, for example, subjecting a compound I wherein the substituent s is are an amino group s to reductive alkylation, i.e., to reduction with a metal hydride such as sodium cyanoborohydride, or to catalytic reduction in the presence of a carbonyl compound e.g.formaline, acetaldehyde or acetone , or to a reaction with an alkyl halide to cause mono or dialkylation.A compound I having mono or dialkylamino group s can also be produced by subjecting a compound I wherein the substituent s is are a nitro group s , to catalytic reduction with a catalyst such as platinum oxide or Raney nickel in the presence of the above mentioned carbonyl compound. The above mentioned production of the compound I having a mono or di alkylamino substituent s may, for example, be illustrated by the following reaction scheme EMI5.1 wherein n is 1 or 2 and R1 represents mono or di alkyl amono as defined hereinbefore. The contemplated compound I obtained in the foregoing manner can be isolated from the reaction mixture and purified by conventional procedures e.g. distillation, recrystallization or column chromatography . According to the types of substituents on Ring A, the compound I may be isolated as pharmaceutically acceptable salts.For example, when an amino group e.g. amino, mono or di alkylamino or cycloamino is present as the substituent, the compound I can be isolated as an acid addition salt e.g. a mineral acid salt such as the hydrochloride or hydrobromide, or an organic acid salt such as the citrate or oxalate , or when the suostitutent is a hydroxyl group, the compound I can be isolated as an alkali metal salt e.g. the sodium salt or potassium salt. The spiro compounds I according to this invention are compounds having a novel skeletal structure, which exhibit gastric secretion inhibitive, anti inflammatory, analgesic and other actions in mammalian animals e.g. man, rat, mouse, guinea pig , for instance, and are of value as anti ulcer, antiinflammatory, analgesic and other drugs for the management of peptic ulcers, acute or chronic gastritis, lumbago, arthritis and other diseases. In such medicinal applications, each compound I can be safely administered orally or parenterally, either as it is or as formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents known per se into suitable dosage forms such as tablets, powders, capsules, injections and suppositories.While the recommended dosage depends on the subject, the condition, the route of administration, etc., the normal oral dosage for the treatment of peptic ulcers or acute or chronic gastritis is about 1 mg. to 20 mg. as compound I per kg body weight per dose, to be given from once to 3 times daily. The starting compound II which is employed in the practice of ths invention can be prepared by the following synthesis route or by any process analogousEMI6.1 EMI7.1 wherein Ring A is as defined hereinbefore The following pharmacological test, and the following reference and working examples are intended to describe this invention in further detail but should not be considered to limiting the scope of this invention in any way.Pharmacological Test The pharmacological activity of the compounds I of this invention was assayed by a gastric juicesecretion inibition test with rats, the results of which are as follows. In accordance with the method described in Gastroenterology 2, 43 1945 , the inhibition of gastric juice secretion was evaluated by means of pylorus ligated rats. Five each of male Sprague Dawley rats each weighing 100 130 g . were used for the control and five test groups. Each animal was deprived of food for 18 hours before the test, except for drinking water. The pylorus of each animal was ligated under aneasthesis with ether, and each test compound was then intraduodenaley administered to the animals of each test group at a dosage of 50 mg. kg. Three hours after the ligation, the animals were sacrificed. The gastric secretions of the tested animals were collected and subjected to centrifuging for 10 minutes 3,500 r.p.m. , and the volume of gastric juice was measured. The results are shown in the table below. The compounds were administered orally to ICRtype mice in groups of five animals at a dosage of 500 mg. kg. so as to examine acute toxicity. No mouse was dead during 7 days in any group.Table Inhibition of Gastric Juice Secretion in RatsEMI8.1 Dose Inhibition of i.d.mg. kg.
