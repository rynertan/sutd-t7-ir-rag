## Description
METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF N PHOSPHONOMETHYLGLYCINE OR SALTS Background of the Invention This invention relates to a novel method for the preparation ofN phosphonomethylglycine or salts thereof, a compound which is a known herbicide and plant growth regulator. Herbicides are widely used by farmers, commercial agricultural companies, and other industries in order to increase crop yields for such staple crops as corn, soybeans, rice, and the like, and to eliminate weed growth along highways, railroad rights of way, and other areas. H.erbi cites are effective in killing or controlling unwanted weeds which com pete for soil nutrients with the crop plants, and by reason of the fact that they kill weeds, are responsible for improving the aesthetic a ppear ance of highway and railroad rights of way. There are a number of different types of herbicides presently sold conmercially, and these fall into two general categories.The categories are pre emergence and tost emergence herbicides. The pre emergence herbicides are applied to the soil prior to the emergence of the weed plants fran the soil, and the post emergence herbicides are applied to plant surfaces after emergence of the weeds or other unwanted plants from the soil. One cf the earliest postemergence herbicides used commercially was 2,4 D 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . After a number of years of use of this and similar compounds such as 2,4,5 T 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxy acetic acid , it was found that certain decomposition products of these herbicides were long lastina and were not biodegradable.While there has been some dispute between governmental agencies and commercial interests regarding the effects of residual products of 2,4D, 2,4,5 T and similar compounds, the agencies nevertheless restricted the use of these herbicides in the United States some years aqo. Since that time, efforts have been made to develop herbicides which are biodegradable into harmless residues within a relatively short time after their application. One such compound, which has been found to be biodegradable, yet which is effective as a herbicide and plant growth regulator when employed at lower rates, is N phosphonomethylglycine and various salts thereof. The Nphosphonomethylglycine and agriculturally effective salts have been approved for use by the U.S. Government, and, as a consequence, this herbicide has become extremely successful commercially. N Phosdhonomethylglycine and certain salts are the only effective and approved post emergence herbicides in the field. The present commercial compound is the isopropylamine salt of N phosphonomethylgly cine and derivatives thereof. In field use it is normally applied in amounts of from 0.01 to about 20 pounds per acre, preferably from 2 to 6 pounds per acre. N Phosphonomethylglycines, and certain soluble salts thereof, can be made in a number of different ways. One such mehtod, as described in U.S. Patent 3,160,632 Tby et al., December 8, 1964 is to react Nphosphinomethylglycine glycinemethylenephosphinic acid with mercuric chloride in a water solvent at reflux temperature, and subsequently separating the reaction products. Another method involves the reaction of ethyl glycinate with formaldehyde and diethylphosphite and subsequent hydrolysis. The latter method is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,799,758 rranz, March 26, 1974 .In addition, there is a whole series of patents, relating to N phosphonomethylglycine, its salts, and derivatives thereof, described as being useful herbicides and plant growth regulators. Such additional patents relating to N phosphonomethylglycine, methods of application, methods of preparation, salts, and derivatives, include U.S. Patent 3,868,407, U.S. Patent 4,197,254, and U.S. Patent 4,199,354, among others. Because of the iiportance of N phosphonomethylglycine and certain salts as a herbicide, other methods of making the compounds are constantly being sought in order to provide improved or alternate methods of manufacture. Summary of the Invention It has now been discovered that N phosphonomethylglycine or soluble salts thereof, can be produced in good yields by the oxidation of glycinemethylenephosphinic acid or salts thereof with an alkali or alkaline earth metal base, the preferred one being concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide. The formula for this reaction using sodium hydroxide as the base can be represented as follows EMI3.1 The reaction is preferably carried out in a conventional reaction vessel under such conditions of temperature and pressure so as to obtain maximum yield.Preferably, the temparature ranges from about 110 to about 1500C, and most preferably from about 125 to 135 C. me reaction is normally carried out at atmospheric pressure, although if increased pressure is used, the reaction time will be diminished, The time of the reaction will vary depending on the trperature used, but in general will range from about 2 to about 12 hours. While sodium hydroxide is the base of choice, other suitable bases include lithium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, and calcium oxide. The reaction is preferbly conducted in an excess of aqueous sodium hydroxide or other base, the excess of aqueous sodium hydroxide serving as the reaction medium. The mole ratio of glycinemethylenephosphinic acid or soluble salt starting material to the preferred base, sodium hydroxide, can range from about 0.02 to about 0.5, with the preferred ratio being 0.10 moles of glycinemethylene phosphinic acid to 1 mole of sodium hydroxide. As previously indicated, an excess of sodium hydroxide or other base is normally used in order to provide a reaction medium for the reactants. The glycinemethylenephosphinic acid can be prepared by the method described in U.S. Patent 3,160,632. This invention will be better understood by reference to the specific examples which follow, which are presented as merely illustrative, non limiting demonstrations of the method of the instant invention. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Sodium Salt of N Phosphonomethylglycine A three necked, 50 milliliter ml round bottom flask is equipped with a maanetic stirrer, a nitroqen bubbler, a reflux condenser, and a therinmeter situated in a heating mantle. To this flask was added 1.5 qrarns q 7.7 mmole of 79 wt. pure glycinemethylenephosphinic acid, and 15 ml of 508 sodium hydroxide. The ingresients were combined under a nitroaen atomsphere, and the reaction mixture was then heated to reflux temperature.The reactants were refluxed for approximately 120 minutes at a temperature of approximately 128 C. Thereafter, the solution was cooled under nitroqen, weiqhed and quantitatively analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc and a strong anion exchange column. The yield of the trisodium salt of N phosphonomethylglycine was 658 of theory. The presence of this salt was confirmed by 13C nmr spectroscopy. EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of Sodium Salt of N Phosphonomethvlalvcine A 50 ml three necked round bottom flask was equipped with a heating mantle, a stirring bar, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser with a nitrogen bubbler. To this flask was added 9.8 a 122 mmol of 50 sodium hydroxide and 20 a of an aqueous solution that contained 12.2 mmole of glycinemethylenephosphinic acid trisodium salt. The solution was heated to reflux temperature, which was approximately 106 C, and refluxed for aoproximately 3 hours. Hplc analysis indicated that the reaction was very sluggish at this temperature. The apparatus was mcdified for distillation and water was distilled until the temperature of the reaction mixture reached 130 C. The mixture was maintained at this temp erature for 8.0 hours and then cooled. The cooled reaction mixture was analyzed auantitatively by hplc and found to contain 7.3 mmole t608 of theory of trisodium salt of N phosphonomethylglycine. Crystalline N phosphonomethylglycine 4.4 mmol, 36 yield was obtained from the reaction mixture by acidification to pH 1.4, chilling and seeding. The N phosphonomethylglycine acid compound which is produced in accordance with the method of the invention, in and of itself, has herbicidal and plant growth regulating efficacy. However, because the free acid is not in itself very soluble in aqueous solutions, it is preferred to convert the compound to salt form for inclusion into herbicidal compositions. Salt forms which have been found to have high rates of herbicidal activity and plant growth regulating activity are the trialkylsulfonium salts, such as are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,315,765. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that vari at ions in times, temperatures, pressures, and the like can be had in the method of the invention without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the claims herein.
