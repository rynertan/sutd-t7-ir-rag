# Piston and seal in a mud pump or the like.

## Abstract
In a pump having a cylinder liner 11 , there is a piston with a seal 74 and rear wearband 92 therearound the piston to seal and align the piston within the liner 11 . The elas tomeric seal ring 74 is in sealing and sliding contact with the liner 11 . A gap filler 78 , with minimal axial creep and con trolled radial creep, abuts the rear surface 82 of the seal 74 and maintains continuous contact with the liner 11 thereby continuously closing the extrusion gap 90 between the gap filler 78 and the liner 11 as the liner 11 wears. The wear band 92 has a plurality of angled flowpaths or grooves 96 traversing it. Abrasive particles 98 are directed within and through the grooves 96 in the wearband 92 while a source of liquid is communicated into the piston, through water channels 88 in the gap filler 78 and through the grooves 96 in the wearband 92 to create a vortex action which washes the liner wall 11 . The wearband 92 insures a con stant gap 90 between the metal piston and liner 11 . The thin seal ring 74 improves the temperature gradient, controls the creep, reduces the axial load and allows rear removal without removing the piston from the liner 11 .
