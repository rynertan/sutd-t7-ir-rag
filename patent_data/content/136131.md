# Method and apparatus for cooling and coating the inside seam of a welded can body.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for cooling and coating the inside seam of a hot welded can body. In the preferred embodiment, the apparatus includes a spray gun having a two orifice nozzle assembly. Operation of the gun causes coating material to be sprayed concurrently from both orifices onto a seam of a can body passing by the nozzle. The first orifice emits a partially atomized spray of coating material on the seam to cool the seam and the second orifice emits an unatomized flow coat of material over the seam. The first spray acts to cool the seam making it more receptive for the coating material applied from the second orifice.
