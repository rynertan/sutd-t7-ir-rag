# Ignition system for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
An ignition system includes a signal generator unit comprising a sensor core coil, and an electronic circuit unit 2 including various components mounted on a substrate board. Both units are accommodated within a unitary casing comprising a frame 5 and a heat sink 10 on which the board is mounted. The casing has an open end or face in which the core is mounted in proximity to an engine driven rotor. The interconnecting leads between the coil and sub strate board include terminal plates 6 and short straps 7 to avoid spurious high frequency radiations and induced signals.
