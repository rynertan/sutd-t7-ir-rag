# Protection relay system.

## Abstract
A protection relay system for detecting a fault in an electric power system having a circuit breaker is described. The protection relay system includes an input conversion unit 100a adapted for connection to the electric power system to receive first and second input signals correspond ing to a current and a voltage of the power system, for converting the magnitude and or the phase of the first and second input signals to produce first, second and third electrical quantities. A comparing unit 7 is connected to receive the first, second and third electrical quantities, for comparing the first and second electrical quantities to produce a first logical state signal, and comparing the third and a fourth electrical quantities to produce a second logical state signal cyclically, and for producing a logical state signal including the first and second logical state signals cyclically. A digital data processing unit 8 is connected to receive cyclically the logical state signal, for producing a first and a second serial logical state signals and for judging whether a phase rotation sequence of the first and second serial logical state signal equals a predetermined sequence and to pro duce a protection relay output signal on the basis of the judgement. The protection relay output signal is used to trip the circuit breaker.
