# Ignition distributor for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An ignition distributor for an internal combustion engine with reduced electric discharge energy and suppressed radio noise generation comprises a rotor electrode 7 capable of rotary motion and a plurality of staionary electrodes 3 arranged substantially in a circle around the rotor electrode with an electric discharge clearance therebetween. The rotor electrode is a sintered mixture comprising at least one of aluminum compounds and boron compounds, and silicon carbide and having a specific resistance of 10 to 10⁶ Ωcm at room temperature.
