# Personal indentification system.

## Abstract
A personal identification system comprises a generator 10 which generates an Offset Number which is recorded on the magnetic stripe of a card, together with the account number PAN of the person to whom the card is to be issued. The generator stores 15 transformed digits of a sequence of digits IN which have been secretly entered 16 by one or more officers of the card issuing institution. To generate the Offset Number the PAN is entered 21 and transformed 23 before being stored to initialize a first feedback shift register 25 . The person to whom the card is to be issued enters 27 a chosen alphanumeric sequence PIN secretly known only to him. The PIN, after undergoing transformation 28 is stored to initialize a second feedback shift register 30 . When both registers have been initialized they are reinitialized by different parts of different digits of transformed IN. Different digits of the two registers are used to initialize a control feedback shift register 35 which when reaching a selected state in its cycle of states controls the generator to generate the Offset Number 46 , based on a selected mapping of the digits, then present, in the first and second feedback shift registers. To use the card it is entered into a verifier. Therein the PAN and Offset Number on the magnetic stripe are read out. The intended user enters a PIN, and the verifier, like the generator, generates an Offset Number. Only if the PIN entered into the verifier is identical to that entered into the generator, does the verifier produce an Offset Number identical to that read off the card, thereby indicating that the card user is the one to whom the card was issued.

## Description
Personal Identification Svstem 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is directed to a personal identificaton system.2. Description of the Prior Art The widespread acceptance of the use of credit and bank cards has led to the need for improved methods for identifying the bearer of a card, as its rightful owner. A variety or systems have been devised for providing personal identifi cation, to prohibit the use of such cards by unauthorized users. Typically, a credit or bank card, issued by a particular institution, bears, in embossed form, the name of the person to whom the card was issued, his or her assigned account number, and the card s expiration date. The card also bears a magnetic stripe on which binary coded representations of the name to whcm the card was issued , the assigned account number, and the expiration date are magnetically recorded.The magnetically recorded information is permanently stored and conveniently accessible by means of a magnetic stripe reader. A space is often provided for the signature of the person to whom the card was issued. Such cards when lost, stolen, or counterfeited have been fraudently used by unauthorized users, resulting in significant losses. More recently, systems have been devised which include in the identity verification process the effect of an assignedPersonal Identification Number. The person to whom the card is issued is assigned a Personal Identification Number. A multi digit number is derived from a combination of the assigned Personal Identification Number and the assigned account number by means of a generator. A binary coded representation of the multidigit number, hereafter referred to as an Offset Number, is also recorded on the magnetic stripe. Prior to a card transaction, the card is inserted into a verifier which magnetically reads the assigned account number and the Offset Number. The card user also enters his or her Personal Identification Number by such means, as a keyboard. Just as the assigned Personal Identification Number in combination with the assigned account number was utilized by the generator to derive the Offset Number, the verifier employs the entered Personal Identification Number in combination with the magnetically read assigned account number to derive anOffset Number. Only if the Offset Number, derived by the verifier, and the Offset Number recorded on the card s magnetic stripe are identical is the user of a card recognized as the rightful owner of the card.The assigned Personal IdentificationNumber provides a measure of security that is linited, sincePersonal Identification Numbers are assigned and thus are necessarily known by others in the employ of the card issuing institution. The security of the foregoing system would be further enhanced by allowing the person to whom the card is issued to secretly select his or her Personal Identification Number, hereafter referred to as PIN. Any alphanumeric sequence, composed of digits selected from the set of ten decimal digits and any given subset including the entire set of alphabetic characters may serve as a PIN. A PIN that is secretly selected should be known only to the rightful owner of the card. An assigned account number may be any numeric sequence composed of digits selected from the set of ten decimal digits. The assigned account number is, hereafter, referred to as the Primary AccountNumber or simply PAN. Clearly since the PAN is assigned it is known to those assigning the PAN. A system described in U.S. Patent No. 3,938,091 derives an 8 digit octal i.e., base 8 number from a single input sequence. For comparison purposes, the single input sequence may be comprised of a secretly selected PIN followed by PAN Cor a segment of leading digits of PAN . The 8 digit octal number may represent an Offset Number. The system transforms a PIN PAN sequence into an Offset Number as follows.The alphanumeric characters of PIN are entered via a keyboard by the card user and the appended digits of PAN or a segment of PAN are entered via the same keyboard by a representative of the institution, honoring the transaction. Each character of the PIN PAN sequence results in a succession of state changes in a 24 stage binary feedback shift register which initially is in the all O s state. The terminal state i.e., the representation of a 24 bit binary number stored in the feedback shift register after the entry of the PIN PAN sequence is dependent upon the PIN PAN input sequence. The set of all PAN s, associated with a particular card issuing institution, are necessarily distinct. Clearly, all possible PIN PAN input sequences will be distinct if the PAN portions are complete.The relationship between the terminal state and the PIN PAN input sequence is fixed by the manufacturer by means of circuit module selection. The depression of a particular key of the input keyboard results in clocking the 24 stage binary feedback shift register by a fixed number of clock pulses causing it to advance that number of states. The terminal state is governed by the cumulative number of clock pulses resulting from a succession of key depressions corresponding to the input sequence.The Offset Number is determined from the 24 bits, represented by the terminal state. Each bit corresponds to the output i.e., state of a particular register stage. A permutation of the 24 outputs are partitioned into 8 3 bit segments. Each 3 bit segment is converted to and displayed as an octal digit taken from the set f0,1,2,,. .,7 . The number of clock pulses associated with each key and the particular partitioning of the 24 bit terminal state into 3 bit segments is realized by circuit modules selected by the manufacturer. The feedback network of the 24 stage register is hard wired and thus is fixed. The bit being fed back is a linear switching function realized with ExclusiveOR gates of the contents of a prescribed set of stages. It is claimed that the states of the register are pseudo randomized.To those schooled in the art, the hard wiredn feedback logic circuitry is among those linear switching functions which cause the 24 stage register to assume 224 1 distinct states Cunder continuous clocking before repeating. The security of the foregoing systen which transforms a PIN PAN sequence into anOffset N o er comprised of 8 octal digits is vulnerable for the following reasons. 1. In the system described in U.S. Patent No. 3,938,091 a single alphanumeric sequence is transformed.PIN and PAN are sequentially entered in a fixed order via a single input device, thereby limiting their transformation. If the PIN and PAN were entered by means of different input devices, removing the restriction of order, individual and separate transformations on them would be possible significantly increasing overall transformation selection by the manufacturer , and allowing the introduction of a many to one into mappin g of the transformed PIN and the transformed PAN to an Offset Number. A many to one into mapping guarantees irreversibility, regardless of which of the other transformations are selected. Many to one into mappings as well as transformations which may be one to one or many to one are realizeable with off the self integrated circuits. 2. In the system described in U.S. Patent No.3,938,091, the institution utilizing the system cannot independently participate in the selection of the overall transformation of a PIN PAN sequence to an Offset Number. The manufacturer exercises ccrnplete control over the selection of the overall transCormation. 3. The system as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,938,091 transforms distinct PIN P.1 input sequences comprised of the same alphanumeric characters into the same Offset Number. For example, PIN PRS input secuences A4B37, BA374, 7BA43, etc.each advance the 24 stage register from the all O s initial state to the same terminal state. Hence, such PIN PAN sequences are transformed into the s me Offset Number. With a fixed correspondence between eac.r. input key and the number of resulting clock pulses, the cumulative sum of clock pulses, associated with an alphanumeric sequerce is independent of the order in which the alphanumeric characters, comprising the alphanumeric sequence are entered. From the foregoing it should be appreciated that the system described in U.S. Patent No. 3,938,091 is quite vulnerable and therefore coes not provide sufficient security against unauthorized use c a card. According to the invention, there is provided a generator for generating an Offset Number for use in a personal identification system of the type in which a card is issued to a person by an entity with a personal assigned number, definable as PAN, being recorded in machine readable form on the card, said generator being arranged to generate an Offset Number which is a function of at least said PAN and a secret code in the form of a digital sequence secretly chosen by and known only by said person, definable as PIN, and said generator comprising a first feedback shift register and interconnected feedback means adapted to assume cycles of states of equal length a second feedback shift register and interconnected feedback means adapted to assume cycles of states of equal length input means for storing digits related to PAN in said first feedback shift register and digits related to PIN in said second feedback shift register and control means for utilizing at least some of the digits in said first and second feedback shift registers to generate an Offset Number after digits related to saidPAN and PIN are stored in said first and second feedback shift registers. The preferred embodiment is directed to a personal identification system which includes significant security enhancing features, as summarized herebelow in connection with sequences or numbers of exemplary lengths. 1. PAN is entered via a dedicated input device.PIN is entered via a different and also dedicated input device.PAN and PIN are individually processed. Each undergoes a distinct succession of transformations and a mapping with distinct portions of a transformed 20 digit decimal sequence subsequently described. The two arguments derived from transformed PAN, transformed PIN, and the transformed 20 digit decimal sequence are then mapped into an Offset Number, comprised of 10 decimal digits. 2. Each generator and each verifier to be used by a particular institution must be enabled with the 20 digit decimal sequence previously mentioned. The 20 digit decimal sequence is called herein the Institution Number, and is hereafter referred to as IN. The one time entry of IN particularizes a given generator or verifier to an institution. As IN is entered, preferably by several officers of the institution, where each privately enters a distinct subsequence of his or her choosing, it undergoes a one to one transformation. Furthermore, the transformed IN is permanently stored and protected with interlocked standby power. The security of the system is thus partitioned.The manufacturer secretly selects the set of integrated circuits which realize the set of transformations and mappings, while the officers of the institution individually and secretly select segments of the 20 digit decimal sequence IN, and each card user secretly selects his or her PIN. 3. The overall mapping of PAN and PIN into a 10 digitOffset Number is a many to one into mapping which guarantees irreversibility whereby PIN s cannot be determined from knownPAN Offset Number combinations. The degree of into mapping is PIN dependent. Hypothetically, if every card user selected identical PIN s, the range of distinct Offset Numbers into which the s PIN combinations can be mapped is less than 8 billion out of a possible 10 billion.Again hypothetically, if every card user selected a different PIN, the range of distinct Offset Numbers into which PPS PIN combinations can be mapped exceed 6 billion out of a total of 10 billion This focusing and defocusing effect is independent of transformations and mappings selected and incorporated by the manufacturer by means of off the shelf integrated circuits and the IN selected by officers of the institution. The personal identification system described herein is not limited in application to determining whether or not the bearer of a credit or bank card is its rightful owner. It has application wherever personal identification is required.Other examples include controlled access through personal identification into classified areas, computer systems, and electronic funds transfer systems. Check cashing and proof of ownership of autcmobiles, drivers licences, stock certificates, securities, and passports also require positive and absolute personal identification. Certain embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS The following summarized description of an example of an embodiment is presented in order to facilitate the subsequent description of the invention in conjunction with theFigures. In accordance with the present invention, an institutions s personal identification system is provided which includes one or more offset generators and a plurality of verifier units. A 20 digit decimal institution number IN is entered into the generator and stored in an IN storage unit. The IN may be entered by one authorized officer of the institution.To enhance security, several officers may enter different portions of the 20 digit IN, which are known only to them, thereby re ducing the probability that unauthorized parties may obtain the entire 20 digit IN. The IN is stored in such a manner that any attempt to learn its numerical value, such as, by opening the machine, would be foiled. Typically, stand by power is provided to the IN storage unit, to protect its content in the event of power failure. Its content is automatically destroyed when an attempt is made to open it to learn of its content. The generator is also provided with 2 input keyboards. When a card is to be issued, the Primary AccountNumber, herein referred to as PAN, is entered into the generator through one of the units. After undergoing a numerical transformation the transformed PAN is stored in a shift register.The person to whom the card is to be issued enters his selfchosen and secret personal identification number herein referred to as PIN, via the other input unit. The PIN after undergoing a numerical t ansrormation is stored in another shift register. The entering of PIN and PAN is asynchronous. After both have been entered, under the command ofatiming and control unit in the generatcr, the transformed PIN and PAN in their respective shift registers undergo a reinitialization operation which is a function of different portions of the stored IN.Thereafter, different portions of the PAN and PIN are used to load up a control register. Subsequently the contents of thePIN and PAN shift registers are clocked out and based on the contents of the control register, 10 successive output digits of the PIN and PAN registers are processed to form a 10 digit decimal Offset Number. This number is automatically recorded on the card s magnetic stripe for subsequent machine reading. When the card is to be used it is fed to a verifier which is similar to the generator in many respects. It too has the 20 digit IN prestored therein. In the verifier, both the Offset Number and the PAN are automatically read off the card s magnetic stripe and are respectively stored in anOffset Number storage unit, and in the PAN shift register. The PIN is entered via an input keyboard by the card user. Once the PIN is entered, the verifier, like the generator, generates an Offset Number as a function of the PIN, PAN, and IN and the particular transformation and criteria employed in the generator which generated the Offset Number which is recorded on the card. The verifier generated Offset Number is compared with that on the card which is temporarily stored in the verifier.If the two are identical, it indicates that the user is the authorized card user. This occurs only if the correct PIN, known only to whom the card was issued, was entered into the verifier. Attention is now directed to Figure 1 which is a simplified block diagram of an Offset Generator 10. The function of the Offset Generator, hereafter also referred to as the Generator, is. to generate the Offset Number as here before defined. The Generator includes three basic storage units whose functions are to store transformations of the IN the PAN, and PIN. Before the Generator can be used, the IN is transformed and loaded into an IN storage unit 15. For explanatory purposes it is assigned that the IN consists of 20 decimal digits and that storage unit 15 comprises 20 stages. The IN is entered by means of IN input unit 16. As each IN digit is entered it passes through a transformation unit 18, which converts each of the decimal digits of the IN into a corresponding decimal digit, which is then fed to storage unit 15 through a multiplexer 19. Once the transformed IN is stored in storage unit 15 it remains therein, for as long as theGenerator is to be used with the particular IN by a particular institution. To enhance the security of the system different institution officers may each enter a distinct segment of the 20 digit IN, known only to him or her. Preferably, the system is designed so that storage ur,it 15 is tamper proof in that any attempt to dete ine the contents of storage unit 15 would result in the destruction of its content i.e., the transformed IM . In practice, storage unit 15 is provided with a standby power source in case of a general power failure, to insure that once the 20 digit IN, entered by one or more officers of the institution, is transformed and stored in the storage unit 15, it remains therein and is not subject to destruction, due to the power failure When an Offset Number is to be generated, a representative of the institution enters a sequence of decimal digits, called the Primary Account Number, PAN, via PAN input unit 21. Every customer is necessarily assigned a unique PAN. Each of the PAN decimal digits is transformed by transformation unit 23 into a corresponding digit and therefrom it is fed through multiplexer 24 to PAN storage unit 25. The latter consists of a Feedbach. Shi t Register FSR . In order forPAN to participate in the generation of a 10 digit OffsetNumber in an 8421 format and in order to provide the system with distributed security FSR 25, hereafter referred to asFSR A, is incorporated. It consists of 10 stages and a feedback network. Each stage is capable of assuming one of 10 states. The feedback network s output is a function of the contents of the register and an external input, reduced modulo 10.Since present devices for storing information are of a binary nature, the modulo 10 FSR A is preferably decomposed into a 10 stage modulo 5 FSR and a 10 stage modulo 2 FSR. The 10 stage modulo 5 FSR can be implemented with three 10 stage binary registers and an appropriate feedback network. Such an implementation with no external input except clock pulses is described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 3,718,863, particular attention being directed to Figure 11 therein. Thus, the 10 stage modulo 10 register portion of the FSR is implementable with four 10 stage binary registers, where three of them are associated with the 10 stage modulo 5 FSR and the fourth one is associated with the 10 stage modulo 2 FSR.In practice, each of the transfo ned PAN decimal digits is fed to FSR A as four bits with three of them being fed to the feedback network of the three binary registers, associated with the modulo 5FSR, and the fourth one to the feedback network of the binary register, associated with the modulo 2 FSR Also included in Generator 10 is PIN input unit 27, by means of which the person, to whom the identification card is issued, enters his or her own secret Personal IdentificationNumber, PIN. The PIN, secretly selected and privately entered by each person, is one of any of the possible sequences of four or more alphanumeric characters. Hereafter, the term digit will be used to denote any PIN character. As each PIN digit is entered, it undergoes a transformation by transformation unit 28 and therefrom it is fed through multiplexer 29 to PIN storage unit 30. The latter is also a l0 stage modulo 10 FSR, hereafter simply referred to as FSR C. FSR C provides a means whereby PIN also participates in the generation of the 10 digit Offset Number. It too, like FSR A, is easily decomposed into a 10 stage modulo 5 FSR, implementable by means of three 10 stage binary registers and a feedback network, and a 10 stage modulo 2 FSR, implementable by means of one 10 stage binary register and a feedback network. The entering of PIN and the entering of PAN are time independent i.e. asynchronous. PIN may be entered before, during, or after the entry of PAN.Each digit of either one of these sequences enters at the rate at which the operator or the person activates the respective input units 21 and 27. Until both transformed PIN and transformed PAN are entered via feedback networks into their respective storage units, i.e., registers of FSR C and A, the timing and control unit 32 of the Generator is inactive. The time at which the entry of both PIN and PAN have been competed is sensed by theGenerator. Upon the completion of the entry of PAN an. end ofPAN signal is produced which may be used to set a flip flop. Likewise, upon the completion of the entry of PIN a signal is produced to set ancther flip flop. When both are set thereby indicating that both PAN and PIN have been entered the tining and control unit 32 assumes its operation. It provides clocking pulses to FSR A and C thereby causing their registers to assume a succession of states, depending on their respective feedback functions and external inputs. During the entry of PIN and PAN, asynchronous clock pulses are provided by their respective input units. Digits of different portions of the transformed IN in storage unit 15 are fed as external inputs to the feedback networks of FSRA and C, respectively, to impact the contents of their corresponding registers by different digits of the transformedIN. In the particular embodiment being described, with registers of FSR A and C each being assumed to be 10 stages long, different 10 stage portions of the 20 digit transformed IN in storage unit 15 are used to impact the contents of each of the respective registers of FSR A and C.For definition purposes, the entering of the transformed PIN and transformed PAN into FSRC and A, respectively, can be thought of as initializing FSRC and A. Then, after having been impacted by the various digits from the IN storage unit 15, FSR C and A, respectively, are said to have been re initialized. From the foregoing it should thus be appreciated that the initialization of FSR A is a function of PAN, which was assigned and recorded by the institution. The initiali zaticn of FSR C is a function of PIN, which is only known to the person to whom the card is being issued. On the other hand, the re initialization of FSR C and A is a function ofPIN and P.Z , respectively, and IN, distinct segments of which may be known only to one or more officers or the institution, and the transform by transformation 18 of which is secretly and safely stored in storage unit 15. If desired, after the re initialization of FSR A and C, their contents may be clocked out and processed to successively output 10 four bit representations of digits of a 10 digit Offset Number in an 8421 format. Such an OffsetNumber could then be recorded together with the PAN on the magnetic stripe of a card. However, in order to further enhance the security of the PIN, additional circuitry is included, as will be described hereinbelow. The additional circuitry includes a 12 stage binary FSR, consisting of Shift Register SR 35 and feedback network 95, hereafter referred to as FSR B, a multiplexer 90, and a transformation unit 38. Briefly, after FSRA and C are reinitialized, nine 9 consecutive bits, stored in the modulo 2 portion of FSR C are clocked into the register of FSR B via multiplexer 90. This 9 bit string undergoes a transformation by transformation unit 38, as will be described hereafter in connection with two specific examples.Following the entry of nine bits from FSR C into the register of FSR B, three bits, representing a digit stored in the modulo .5 FSR porticn cf FSR A, are clocked into the register of SR B.These three bits de not undergo a transformation by transformatIon unit 38. After the register of FSR B is loaded with 12 bits to which some are transformed3 and is therefore fully initialized,FSR B is continuously clocked by timing and control unit 32. Thus, the 12 stages of the register of FSR B cycle through a succession of different states, governed by the feedback function of FSR B. The feedback function is chosen so that FSR B is singular and non linear. The longest possible state sequence is one in which each state has a unique successor state and each state, except two, has a unique predecessor state. One of the foregoing two states has no predecessor state while the other has two predecessor states. As previously stated, FSR B, after initialization, is clocked continuously and therefore sequences through various states. Being 12 stages long, it is capable of sequenceing through at most 212 4096 states. At the same time, FSR A and C are also clocked and each assumes a succession of states lying on a closed cycle in which every state has a unique successor state and a unique predecessor state. Associated with FSR B is decoder 40. When decoder 40 detects that FSR B is in a preselected state it effectively establishes a window period. During this period a processor 45 is activated. Processor 45 effectively processes the contents of the 10 stages of FSR A and C based on particularly selected processing functions to produce 10 4 bit representations of digits which comprise the 10 digit Offset Number. The latter is fed to output unit 46 which may include a display of theOffset Number an or means for directly recording the OffsetNumber on the magnetic stripe of the card. Attention is now directed to Figure 2 which contains a more detailed functional block diagram of IN storage unit 15 and FSR s A and C. This functional block diagram will be used to describe the manner in which the IN storage unit 15 is first loaded with the transformed IN, as well as to describe the initialization and the re initialization of FSR A and C as herebefore deigned, in connection with two specific examples.As shown in Figure 2, the IN storage unit 15 consists of four 20 stage S1 S20 binary registers, designated by numerals 61 64.Since each transfcred IN digit is a decimal digit, its binary representation contains four bits and therefore four registers are required. For explanatory purposes, let it be assumed that the 20 digit IN consists of the decimal digits as shorn in line a of Figure 3 and that these digits are chosen and entered by one or more institution officers via IN input unit 16, shown in Figure 1. As previously explained each entered digit undergoes a transformation by transformation unit 18. For explanatory purposes, let it be assumed that the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, 9, are transformed by transformation unit 18 into corresponding digits 1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6,9,8, respectively. Thus, the 20 digits comprising IN as shown in line a of Figure 3 are transformed by transformation unit 18 to the corresponding digits indicated in line b of Figure 3. Each of these digits is stored as a 4 bit representation in corresponding stages of the four registers 61 64.Registers 61 63 store binary representations of the modulo 5 portion of the transformed IN digits correspond ing to the columns of entries in lines d,e, and f while the fourth register 64 stores the modulo 2 portion of each transformed In digit as shown in line g. For example, the first transformed digit is 0, see line b of Figure 3 is stored as well as all zeroes in stages S1 of the four registers 61 64. On the other hand, the second transformed IN digit which is a nine is divided into a transformed modulo 5 portion with a base 5 value of 4 see line C and a transformed modulo 2 portion with a base 2 value of 1. The decomposition of each transformed digit into modulo 5 and modulo 2 portions is achieved by regarding the three higher ordered bits of the 4 bit representation of a decimal digit, as representing the modulo 5 portion and the least signIficant bit, as representing the modulo 2 portion.It should be noted that the three higher ordered bits in the 10 4 bit conbinations representing the decimal digits in an 8421 format represent a base 5 digit i.e., 0,1,2,3 or 4.The digits 0,1,2,3 and 4 comprise a reduced residue system modulo 5. Thus, whereas the binary representatIon of 9 is 1001, the three higher order bits, 100 the binary equivalent of 4 represent the modulo 5 portion and the least significant bit 1 represents the modulo 2 portion. The loading of the four registers 61 64 with the transformed IN is done via multiplexers 19A 1QD Figure 2 which together comprise the multiplexer 19, shown in Figure 1.In Figure 2, it is assumed that the bits are clocked into the four registers 61 ó with the last stage S20 of each register representing the input stage. The IN input unit 16 in Figure 1 provides asynchronous clock pulses during the one time entry of the IN. For the particular example it should be apparent that after the 20 digit transformed IN is clocked or entered into storage unit 15, the four registers 61 64 store the binary values as indicated below their respective stages. In Figure 3, the modulo 5 portion of the transformed IN digits appears in line c and the modulo 2 portion of the transformed IN digits appears in line g. The incorporation of IN storage unit 15 for storing a transformation of the IN, is most significant. In essence, it customizes the Generator for a particular institution.Since the manufacture of the Generator does not know the IN ultimately to be selected and entered into the generator by one or more officers of the institution the system is protected from either unscrupulous manufacturers or the blackmailing of honest manufacturers by anyone attempting to establish valid PAN PIN OFFST combinations. Also, as previously stated, it is preferred that different officers of the institution select and insert distinct segments of the 20 digit IN. A collusive effort would, therefore, be required to determne the IN in its entirety. As previously discussed, FSR A and FSR C are 10 stage modulo 10 feedback shift registers. Each is decomposed into a 10 stage modulo 5 FSR and a 10 stage modulo 2 FSR. Also, the modulo 5 FSR portion is in practice implementable by three binary registers with an appropriate feedback network, as described in the aforementioned U.S. patent, with the addition of an external input. However, in Figure 2, each of the FSR sA and C is shown as the combination of a nonbinary modulo 5FSR and a binary modulo 2 FSR. FSR A is represented in Figure 2 by the modulo 5 FSR portion comprised of a 10 stage register 71 with its modulo 5 feedback network 72 and the nodulo 2 FSR portion, comprised of a 10 stage binary register 74 and its modulo 2 feedback network 75.Likewise, FSR C is represented in Figure 2 by a modulo 5 FSR portion, comprised of a 10stage register ai with its modulo 5 feedback network 82 and a modulo 2 FSS portion, comprised of a 10 stage binary register 84 and its modulo 2 feedback network 85. It is appreciated by those familiar with modulo 2 i.e., binary FSR s that by operating the feedback networks o such FSRs in accordance with appropiate feedback functions, the registers of the FSRs will assume cycles of states of equal length . See U.S. Patent No. 3,609,327. Thus, registers 74 and 84 of the modulo 2 portions of FSR A and S C, C, respec tively, can each be made to assume cycles of states of length 24 16, with the possible number of distinct cycles being 26 64.Equal length cycles are realized with feedback networks 75 and 85, respectively, yielding appropriate feedback functions. It will be further appreciated by those familiar wit the art that by operating the feedback networks o modulo 5 SR s in accordance with appropiate feedback functions, the registers of the FSRs will assume cycles of states of equal length. Thus, registers 71 and 81 of the module 5 portions of FSR A and FSR C, respectively, can be made to assume cycles of states of length 5 25, with the possible number of distinct cycles being 58 390,625. Equal length cycles are realized with feedback networks 72 and 82, respectively, yield appropriate feedback functions. It will be appreciated by those familiar with the art that the 510 possible states of a 10 stage modulo 5 FSR will lie on 58 disjoint cycles, each of which is length 52 25 if the feedback function is the modulo 5 sum of twize the outpu of the fifth stage SS and four times te output of the tenth stage S10 and a ncnzero constant 1,2,3, or 4. As shown in Figure 2Jthe outputs of stages S5 and S10 of the 10 stage register 71 are inputs to the modulo 5 feedback network 72. The feedback network 72 is further provided with an external input designated EA5 from multiplexer 24A, which together with multiplexer 24B, comprise multiplexer 24 shown in Figure 1. EA5 is a 3 bit representation of a base 5 digit i.e., 0,1,2,3 or 4 . Appearing at EAs are representations of either a succession of the modulo 5 portion of transformedPAN digits designated PAN5, a succession of the modulo 5 portion of selected digits of the transformed IN designated d or the constant 0 i.e., 000 .During the initialization of FSR A,PAN digits emanate from PAN input unit 21 shown in Figure 1, and are transformed by transformation unit 23 The modulo 5 portion of the representation of transformed PAN digits namely,PAN5 appear at EA5 via multiplexer 24A in Figure 2 until the initialization o FSR A is completed. During the re initialization of FSR A, the modulo 5 portion of representations of selected digits of the transformed IN which are stored in registers 61 63 namely, 65 appear at EA5 via multiplexer 24A.At all other times a representation of the constant 0 i.e., 000 appears at Egg Also, as shown in Figure 2, the outputs of stages 52, SS and S10 of the 10 stage register 74 are inputs to the modulo 2 feedback network 75. The feedback network 75 is further provided with an external input designated EA2 from multiplexer 245 which, as previously stated, together with multiplexer 24A comprise multiplexer 24 in Figure 1. EA2 is either a succession of bits corresponding to the modulo portion of transformed PAN digits designated PAN2, a succession of bits corresponding to the modulo 2 portion of selected digits of the tsansformed IN designated 62 or the constant binary 0. As previously stated, during the initialization ofFSR A, PAN digits emanate from the PAN input unit 21 shown in Figure 1, and are transformed by the transformation unit 23. The modulo 2 portion of the transformed PAN digits namely,PAN2, appear at EA2 via multiplexer 24B, until the initialization of FSR A is completed. During the re initialization ofFSR A, the modulo 2 portion of selected digits of the transformed IN which are stored in register 64 namely 62 appear at E2 via multiplexer 24B. At all other times the constant binary 0 appears at EA2 The output of the modulo 5 feedback network 72 is a function of the modulo 5 portion of FSR A as well as the external input EAS and is best summarized in the table, given in Figure 4.ThereinEMI22.1 denotes the output of stage S5 of register 71 at Clock Pulse Interval CPI M. whereasEMI22.2 denotes the output of stage S10 at CPI k, and EAS represents the external modulo 5 input at the same CPI k . The digit which is actually fed back to stage S1 of register 71 from feedback network 72 is a function of the digits stored in stages S5 and S10 and the external input to the feedback network, EA5, appears among digits enclosed by a dashed line in Figure 4.When the external input EAS is 0, the feedback function associated with two specific examples may be described mathematically as follows.EMI22.3 where Ak denotes the digit being fed back to stage S1 of register 71 at CPI k. As to the modulo 2 feedback network 75 of the modulo 2 portion of FSR A, its feedback function can always b expressed mathematically as follows. EMI23.1 where EMI23.2 denotes the output of state S2 of register 74 at CPI k, andEMI23.3 andEMI23.4 denote the outputs of stages S8 and 510, respectively, at CPI k, and EA2 denotes an external modulo 2 input to feedback network 75 at the same CPI kAlso Ak 2 denotes the bit being fed back to stage S1 of register 74 at CPI k. In operation, as each PAN digit is entered via PAN input 21, it is transformed by transformation unit 23. For explanatory purposes, it is assumed that the latter transforms digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 into respective digits 1,0,3,7,5,4,7,6,9,5. The three higher ordered bits of the 8421 binary representation of each digit represent the modulo 5 portion of the transforned PAN digit, i.e. PE 5. PAN is fed to multiplexer 24A and therefrom to the feedback network 72 for initializing register 71 of the modulo 5 FSR.The least significant bit of the representation of each transformed P.5S digit, designated PAN2, is fed to multiplexer 243 and therefrom to the feedback network 75 for initializing register 74 of the modulo 2 FSR. Thus, after all the P digits are entered, the two registers 71 and 74, which together comprise the ndulo 10 register of FSR are initialized. For explanatory purposes, let it be assumed that the PAN is 12 digits in length and consists of digits 137058429602.it should be appreciated that after transformation these 12 digits respectively become 0,2,6,1,4,9,3,3,8,7,1,3 and are decomposed into modulo 5 components 0 1 3 0 2 4 2 1 4 3 0 1 and modulo 2 components 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1, respectively. The PAN digits, the transformed PAN digits, the modulo 5 com ponents i.e., PAN5 and nodulo 2 components i.e., PAN2 of the transforned PAN digits are listed in Figure 5 on lines a,b,c, and d, respectively. Initially, both registers 71 and 74 are in the all zeros state. However, as they are initialized by entering transformed components of the PAN digits via their respective feedback networks, the cycle through various states, governed by each feedback function. The state of each of registers 71 and 74 after initialization as indicated by the digit string appearing above each respective register in Figure 2.Successive states of registers 71 and 74 from the start until the completion of their initialization are listed in tabular form inFigure 6. As previously stated, like modulo 10 FSR A, modulo 10FSR C is also decomposed into a modulo 5 FSR portion and a modulo 2 FSR portion. The modulo 5 FSR portion of FSw. C is represented in Figure 2 by the 10 stage register 81 with its associated modulo 5 feedbac. network 82, and the modulo 2 FSR portion of FSR C is represented by the 10 stage register 84 with its associated modulo 2 feedback network 85. In addition to the outputs of stages S5 and S10 of register 81, the modulo 5 feedback network 82 is also provided with a 3 bt external input from multiplexer 292, which together wtn multiplexer 295 comprise multiplexer 29, shown in Figure 1.The external input to the modulo 5 feedback network 82, designatedEC5, is the modulo 5 portion of each transformed PIN digit designatedPIN5 which is supplied to multiplexer 29A from PIN input unit 27 via transrormation unit 28 during initialization or during re initialization, a 3 bit external input designated Y5 which represents the modulo 5 portion of selected digits of the transformed IN stored in registers 61 63. At all other times the external input EC5 is a representation of the constant 0 i.e., 000 . As to the modulo 2 feedback network 85, in addition to the inputs corresponding to the respective outputs of stages S2, S8, and 510 of register 84, it is also supplied with a single bit external input from multiplexer 29B. The single bit external input, designated EC2 is the modulo 2 portion of each transformed PIN digit designated PTS2 which is supplied to multiplexer 293 fromPIN input unit 27 via transformation unit 28 during initialization.During re initialization the single bit external input designatedEC2 is the modulo 2 portion of selected digits of the transformedIN stored in register 64 denoted by y2. At all other tines the constant binary 0 appears at EC2, The output of the modulo 5 feedback network 82 is a tunction of the contents of the fifth stage S5 and the tenth stage S10 of the modulo 5 portion of FSR C i e. register 81, as well as the external input E and is best summarized in the table given in Figure 7. ThereinEMI25.1 denotes the output of stage S5 of register 81 at CPl k whereasEMI25.2 denotes the output of stageS10 at CPI k, and Ec5 represents the external modulo 5 input, at the same CPI k.The digit which is actually fed back to stage S1 of register 81 from feedback network 82 as a function of the digits stored in stages S5 and S10 and the external input to the feedback network, EC5 appears among the digits enclosed by a dashed line in Figure 7. When the external input Ec5 is 0, the feedback function associated with two specific examples may be described mathematically as follows.EMI25.3 whereEMI25.4 denotes the digit being fed back to stage S1 at CPi k. The feedback function of the modulo 2 feedback network 85 can always be expressed mathematically as follows.EMI25.5 whereEMI25.6 denotes the output of stage 52 of register 84 at CPl k, andEMI25.7 EMI25.8 denote the outputs of stages S8 and S10, respectively, at CPi k, andEC2 denotes an external modulo 2 input to feedback network 85, at the same CPI k. Attention is now dirrected to Figure S, wherein a selected PflJ in alphanumeric characters appears in line a. Its numerical equivalent is given in li b as 63385. As these digits emanate from PIN input unit 27 chey are transformed by transformation unit 28 into corresponding digits as given in line c. Lines d and e of Figure 8 are the modulo 5 portions i.e., PP5 and the mod 2 portions i.e., PI 2 , respectively, of the various transformed PIN digits which, as hereinbefore described, are supplied to multiplexers 29A and 29S, respectively. Figure 9, to which attention is now directed, is sinilar to Figure 6 and it represents the succession of states of registers 8i and 84 of FSR C during the initialization. Successive states from the start until the completion of the initialization are listed in tabular forri. in Figure 9. The states of registers 81 and 84, after initialization are indicated by the digit string appearing above these registers in Figure 2. Once the two registers FSR A and FSR C have been initialized with transformed PAN and transformed PIN, respectively, the clocking of the various registers of the Generator is controlled bv timing and control unit 32. For explanatory purposes, it is assumed that after the two registers FSR A and FSR C have been initialized as previously described, timing and control unit 32 clocks the two FSR s for a preselected number of Clock Pulse Intervals CPI s before reinitialization occurs. As previously discussed, the external inputs to the feedback network of FSR A and FSR C i.e., EA5,EA2, EC5, EC2, in Figure 2 are zero at all times other than during initialization and re initialization of FSR A and FSR C. Figures 10 and 11 respectively are tabulations of the successive states assumed by the modulo 5 and modulo 2 registers of FSR A and FSR C. As shown therein it is assumed that after initialization of both registers, designated to have occurred at CPI 0, the FSRs are clocked for 17 CPIs with their external inputs at zero before the transformed IN starts inpacting the contents of the FSR s.As shown in Figure 2, it is assumed that the modulo 5 portion of FSR A is supplied with the modulo 5 portions of the transformed IN digits stored in stages S12 S20 and S1, of registers 61,63 where the successive contents of stages S12 are denoted buy 65, and the modulo 2 portion of FSR A is supplied with the modulo 2 portions of the transformed IN digits stored in stages S2 Sll of register 64 where the successive contents of stage S2 are denoted by 62. Thus, different portions of representations of different digits of the transformed IN are fed to the feedback networks of FSR A as external inputs. Likewise, the modulo 5 portions of the transformed In digits in stages 52 Sll of register 61 63 are fed to the mcdulo 5 portion of FSR C as external input Tg and the modulo 2 portions of the transformed IN digits in stages S12 S20 and S1 of register 64 are fed as external input Y2 to the modulo 2 portion of FSR C. Attention is now directed to Figures.2and 10. Starting at CPI 17, the contents of each of the four registers 61 64 comprisingIN storage unit 15 are cyclically shifted for 20 CPIs under the control of timing and control unit 32. The content of stage 520 becomes the content of stage S19 of each respective register upon receiving a clock pulse from timing and control unit 32. Whereas, the content of stage S19 becomes the content of stage 518 during the same CPI etc., and the content of stage S1 of each register is transferred to stage 520 via respective multiplexers 19A 19D shown in Figure 2, which comprise multiplexer 19 in Figure 1.DuringCPI 17 26 i.e., the first 10 consecutive CPIs during which the contents of registers 61 64 are cyclically shifted, the outputs of stages S12 of registers 61 63, denoted by 65, are supplied to the modulo 5 portion of FSR A via multiplexer 24A as a sequence of external inputs denoted by Eats. As shown in Figure 10, 5 duringCPI 17 26 represents the modulo 5 digit sequence 4 4 3 0 1 0 1 2 3 0. Prior to the re initialization of FSR A and FSR C, the foregoing sequence is stored as 10 3 bit representations in stages 512 520 and SI, respectively, of registers 61 63 in Figure 2. The binary representation of each digit, 5 5 4 5 2 5 1 is sequentially stored in stages 512 of registers 61 63 and supplied to the modulo 5 portion of FSR A, as heretofore indicated.Simultaneously, during CPI 17 26, the output of stage S2 of register 64 denoted by 62 is supplied to the modulo 2 portion of FSR A via multiplexer 24B in Figure 2 which together with multiplexer 24A comprise multiplexer 4 in Figure 1 as a sequence of external inputs denoted by EA2 As shown in Figure 10, 2 during CPI 17 26, represents the modulo 2 i.e., binary sequence 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1. Prior to the re initialization of FSR A and FSR C, the foregoing binary sequence is storey in stages 52 Sll, respectively, of register 64 inFigure 2. In a like manner, during CPI 17 26, the outputs of stages 52 of registers 61 63, denoted by Y5, are supplied to the modulo 5 portion of FSR C via multiplexer 29A as a sequence of external inputs denoted by vC5 As shown in Figure 11, Y5 during CPI 17 26 represents the modulo 5 sequence 4 4 4 0 0 2 1 2 0 4. Prior to the re initialization of FSR A and FSR C, the foregoing sequence is stored as 10 3 bit representations in stages S2 S11, respectively, of registers 61 63 in Figure 2.The binary representation of each digit, gamma 5 y5 4 y5 2 y5 1 is sequentially stored in stages S2 of registers 61 63 and supplied to the mcdulo 5 portion ofFSR C as heretofore discussed. Simultaneously, during CPI 17 26, the output of stage S12 of register 64, denoted by Y2, is supplied to the modulo 2 portion of FSR C via multiplexer 29B, which together with multiplexer 29A comprise multiplexer 29, shown in Figure 1, as a sequence of external inputs denoted by EC2. As shown inFigure 11, gamma 2 during CPI 17 26 represents the modulo 2 i.e., binary sequence 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 .Prior to the re initialization of FSR A and FSR C, the foregoing binary sequence is stored in stages 512 S20 and S1, respectively, of register 64 in Figure 2. At CPI 27 the re initialization of FSR A and FSR C is completed. The state of registers 71 and 74 upon re initialization of FSR A is as indicated by the digit string appearing below each respective register in Figure 2. These digit strings correspond te the state of the modulo 5 and modulo 2 portions of FSR A, respectively, at CPI 27 as given in Figure 10. The state of registers 81 and 84 upon re initialization of FSR C is as indicated by the digit string appearing below each respective register in Figure 2.These digit strings correspond to the state of the mcdulo 5 and modulo 2 portions of FSR C, respectively, at CPI 27 as shown inFigure 11. It should be appreciated that the states appearing in FSR A and FSR C at C i 17 are mapped into their respective reinitialized states at CPI 27 by sequences of 10 external inputs, which are functions of the transformed IN as previously described.After CPI 26 i.e., starting at CPI 27 , the external inputs to the feedback networks of RSR A and FSR C become and remain at 0.The feedback functions where EA5, EA2, EC5 and EC2 are all at 0 are mathematically characterizeable as previously discussed. Furthermore, the cycles of states of the modulo 5 portions of FSRA and FSR C are of equal length as are the cycles of states of the modulo 2 portions of FSR A and FSR C. It should be appreciated that the re initialization ofFSR A and FSR C requires only 10 CPIs. However, since IN storage unit 15 is comprised of 20 stage binary registers, the registers 61 64 are supplied with an additional 10 clock pulses afterFSR A and FSR C have been re initialized in order to cyclically shift their contents to their original position and restore the transformed IN in preparation for the next PAN and PIN entries. As previously indicated, a 10 digit Offset Number could be derived starting at any preselected CPI after the completion of the re initialization of FSR A and FSR C. For example, atCPI k 37 as shown in Figure 10,EMI30.1 It should be noted that Ai is a 4 bit representation of a decimal digit in an 8421 format. The three most significant bits correspond to the binary representation ofEMI30.2 and the least significant bit is the representation ofEMI30.3 Similarly, at CPI k 37 as shown in Figure 11,EMI30.4 As in the case of A is a 4 bit representation of a decimal digit in an 8421 format.The three most significant bits correspond to the binary representation ofEMI30.5 and the least significant bit is the representationEMI30.6 The ith stages of the four 10 stage binary registers, associated with FSR A, store the binary representation ofSimilarly, the ith stages of the four 10 stage binary registers, associated with SR C, store the binary representation of Ci. The time interval cPI k during which A. and C. are stored in the ith i i stages of FS A and FSR C, respectively, is implied in the foregoing expressions for Ai and Ci. Corresponding Ai s and Ci s starting CPI k 37 could be sequentially combined by processor 45, shown in rigure 1, in accordance with the preselected processing function, shown in Figure 13.Thus, corresponding Ai s and Ci s are combined as follows A1 A2 ... A10 2 3 6 4 5 5 5 6 1 0 C1 C2 ... C10 8 9 1 6 4 6 9 0 8 0 D1 D2 ... D10 4 8 7 0 5 1 0 4 3 8 where Di Ai 3Ci 8 mod 10 and 1 i 10 The output of processor 45 in Figure 1 is the Offset Number. D1 D2 ... D10 4 8 7 0 5 1 0 4 3 8 for the PAN, PIN and IN, given in Figures 5 line a , 8 line a and 3 line a , respectively. Thus, the generation of the OffsetNumber is dependent upon the PAN which is assigned by the institution, the IN, which is secretly selected for a one time entry by one or preferably more officers of the institution, and the PIN which is secretly selected by the customer. Furthermore, the transformations and mappings, the modulo 5 feedback networks associated with FSR A and FSR C, and the output processor 45, which are realized by electronic circuitry, affect the generation of the OffsetNumber.The electronic circuitry in the form of integrated circuits is secretly selected by the manufacturer for each set of Generators and verifiers, subsequently discussed to be delivered to a particular institution. Clearly, the overall mapping of PAN and PIN into an Offset Number is identical for all units. As previously pointed out in a preferred embodiment, additional circuitry is provided to further affect the generation of the Offset Number. The circuitry will be explained in connection with a specific example in relation to the example, hereinSefore described. Included in the circuitry is the 12 stage binary shift register 35 and the binary feedback network 95, shown in Figures 1 and 12. In accordance with a particular embodiment of the present invention one CPI after FSR A and FSR C have been re initialized by the transformed IN, i.e. at C i 28, initialization of register 35 starts. During CPI 28 36 the bit stored in stage S10 of register 84 of SR C is fed to register 35 via transformation unit 38 and multiplexer 90. As shown in Figure 11, during CpI 28 36, stage 10 of the modulo 2 register portion of FSR C, i.e. register 8t, successively stores the bits 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0.These bits are serially fed to transformation unit 38 wherein they undergo a preselect transformation. In a particular embodiment, a one toone non linear transfcrm.ation takes place, whereby the second, third, fifth, eighth and ninth bits which pass through transformation unit 38 are complemented, so that a 1 becomes a 0 and a 0 becomes a 1.Thus the succession of bits in register 84 at CPI 28, shown in Figure 11 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 , as read from right te left, the order in which they are supplied to transformation unit 38, is transformed to the succession of bits 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 as read from right to left. See Figure 12 . During CPI 37 39, the three bits stored in register 71 of FSR A and representing a particular base 5 digit are successively supplied to register 35 via multiplexer 90.In the particular example it is assumed that the three bits are those representing the base 5 digit 3 stored in stage 58 of register 71 during CPI 37, stage S9 during CPI 38 and stage 510 during C I 39. See Figure 10 . The 3 bits representing digit 3 are 0 1 1 where the rightmost bit i.e., the least significant bit is supplied first. These 3 bits do not undergo a transformation but are fed directly to register 35 via multiplexer 90. Thus, at CPI 40 bits 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 are stored in the stages S1 512, respectively, of register 35, and the register is fully initialized. Once register 35 has been initialized, together with its binary feedback network 95, it operates as a binary FSR, referred to earlier as FSR B. For purposes to be described hereafter in detail a non linear feedback function is chosen so that the register 35 operates as a singular non linear FSR. The feedback may be described by the following non linear switching function. bk bk 4bk 7 bk 12 bk 1bk 2 ... bk 11bk 12 where bk 1 denotes the content of ith stage at CPI k for 1 i 11 and bk 12 is the complement of the content of the 12th stage at Cr1 k. Therein bk denotes the bit being fed back to stage SI of register 35 at CPI k. ae contents of stages S1 S12 of register 35 are supplied to decoder 40. Its function is to sense the content of eac of the stages of register 35 and provide a control output to processor 45 when the stages are in a particular combination of states. Once this control signal is supplied to processor 45 even though reviser 35 continues to cycle through its states, processor 45 remains enabled and processes the contents of FSR A and FSR C in order to generate the Offset Number, based on preselected processing functions. For explanatory purposes, it is assumed that whenever stages S1 S12 of register 35 are respectively in the states of 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 an enabling control signal is supplied by decoder 40 to processor 45. For this particular example this combination of states occurs at a CPI which is two CPI s following the initialization of register 35. Referring to Figures 10 and 11, therein at CPI 41 the states of the modulo 5 and modulo 2 register portions of FSR A andFSR C are respectively tabulated, as well as the states of these registers during a subsequent time period, designated as CPI n 10.During CPI n 10 as well as during 9 successive CPI s, herein designated as n 9 through n l, corresponding Ai s and Ci s as previously defined stored in the ith stages of FSR A and FSR C, respectively, are sequentially combined by processor 45. During these 10 CPI s, processor 45 maps the contents of FSR A and FSR C into the Offset Number. In order to facilitate the following explanations the contents of registers 71 and 74 of FSR A and registers 81 and 84 of FSR C are diagrammed in Figure 12 with their respective states given at CPi n 10. Also, shown in Figure 12 are the modulo 10 equivalents, i.e. A. and C. for i 1,2,...,10. In order to 1 1 further enhance the security provided by the system, two different processing functions are used in processor 45 to generate the 10 digit Offset Number. The 10 digits of the Offset Number, as previously designated, are D1 through D10 During CPI n 10 digitD10 is generated.The processing function for D10 may be expressed as follows EMI34.1 It should be noted thatEMI34.2 denotes the output of stage S5 of register 81 contained in FSR C at CPI k n 10, whereasEMI34.3 denotes the output of stage S10 at CPI n 10.Also,EMI34.4 whereEMI34.5 denotes the output of stage So of register SL contained inFSR C at CPI k n 10, andEMI34.6 denote the outputs of stages S8 and S10, respectively, at CPI k n 10.From the foregoing and Figure 12, it should be apparent that EMI34.7 is equal to 2 x 0 4 x 2 1 4 mod 5, whileEMI34.8 is equal to 0 1 0 1 0 nod 2. Therefore, D10 is equal to 2 x 4 0 8. As to the processing and the generation of the other nine digits of the Offset Number i.e. Dl D9 they are generated based on the processing function Di Ai 3Ci 8 mod 10 1 i 10Wherein Ai is a 4 bit representation of a decimal digit stored in stages S. of FSR A in an 8421 format, and similarly C. is a 4 bit i i representation of a decimal digit stored in stages S. of FSR C in an 8421 format. In this particular example corresponding A. 5 and Ci S for i 1,2,...,9 are sequentially combined in accordance with the preselected processing function shown in Figure 13. At CPI k n 10, A10 and C10 are stored in stages S10 ofFSR A and FSR C, respectively, as shown in Figure 12, and D10 is derived as previously shown. At CPI n 9, the contents of FSR A andFSR C will have been shifted to the right, such that A9 and Cg and 6 respectively will be stored in stages Sl0 of FSR A and FSR C, respectively and D9 is derived by processor 45 as follows D9 Ag 3C9 8 mod 10 4 s 3 x 6 8 0 mod 10Successive Di s for i 8,7,...,2 and 1 are similarly derived as is D9 by processor 45. The generation of the Offset Number is completed at CPI k n l when D1 is derived. The 10 digit OffsetNumber for this example appears above processor 45 in Figure 12.This is the Offset Number for the PAN, PIN and IN given in Figures 5 line a , 8 line a and 3 line a , respectively. The OffsetNumber D1 D2 ...D9 D10 9 827904708 as shown in Figure 12, includes the effects of FSR B comprised of register 35 and its feedback network 95 , decoder 40 and transformation unit 38 as well as processor 45 with two preselected pro cessina functions. In the foregoing example, the role of FSR B and decoder 40 is further detailed as follows. After FSR A and SR C have been re initialized at CPI 27 , the initialization of FSR B begins at CPI 29 . After the completion of the initialization of FSR B at CPI 40 , FSR B i.e., register 35 and feedback network 95 and decoder 40 supply timing and control signals starting at CPI 42 n l in addition to those emanating from timing and control unit 32. Attention is now drawn to Figure 14. FSR A and FSR C continue to assume a succession of states until register 35 of FSR 9 assumes the preselected state I 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 where the left ost bit resides in stage 51 and is denoted by bk 1. The nonlinear switching function bk bk 4bk 7 bk 12 bk 1bk 2 ... bk 11bk 12 previously shown characterizes the state behavior of rSR B.The preselected state 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 designated to occur at CPI n lO is the first of 10 successive stanesas sensed by decoder 40 which establishes a window period 10 C I s in length. The last state in the window namely, 1 1 1 11 1 1 Il 110, appears at CPI n l. This state is succeeded by the all l s state at CPI n which appears after the Offset Number has been derived. Furthermore, the all l s state is the terminal state of FSR B since it is its own successor state. During the 10 CPI window period, decoder 40 provides timing and control signals for enabling processor 45 and for serially clearing i.e. resetting various registers in Generator 10 of Figure 1 in preparation for the entry of anotherPAN and PIN co.bina ion. The time elapsed in C Is between the initialization of FSR B and the appearance of the 10 CPI window period is dependent upon the initial state ofFSR B. The initial state of FSR B in turn is a function of PAN, PIN and IS. In this example, as indicated in Figure 14, initialization of FSR B is completed at CPI 40 whereas the beginning of the 10 CPI window period occurs two CPI s later. Distinct initial states of FSR B result in different time appearances of the 10 CPI window period. FSR B can assume any one of 5 x 512 2560 initial states. Any one of 512 9 bit combinations can be the initial state of the nine rightmost stages i.e., stages S4 S12 of register 35 of FSR B shown inFigure 12. On the other hand, the three leftmost stages i.e., stages Sl S3 of register 35 will be initialized with one of 5 possible 3 bit combinations. The 5 3 bit combinations are respective binary representations of base 5 digits 0,1,2,3 and 4.in a 421 format. By restricting the initialization of stagesSl S3 to binary respresentations of base 5 digits where the most significant digit resides in stage Sl the total initial state of FSR B can never be a member of the 10 states appearing in FSR B during the 10 CPI window period, as shown in Figure 14. A second example is herein resented for explanatory purposes. No restriction is placed on the sequence of decimal digits PAN. The secretly selected and privately entered PIN may be any one of the possible sequences of four or more alpha nun eric characters provided by PIN input unit 27 in Figure 1.Thus, the number of possible distinct PAN PIN combinations that will be entered into a customized Offset Generator is equal to the number of assigned PAN s which are necessarily different .In the second example the same set of transformations and mappings, feedback networks, and preselected processing functions associated with processor 45 in Figure 12 are used. However, a different 20 digit IN is assumed. Reference is now made to Figure 15. Therein 20 digit IN, IN transformed, the modulo 5 components of IN transformed, and the modulo 2 components of IN transformed appear in lines a, b, c, and d, respectively. The PAN comprising of 9 digits, PAN transformed, PA . .5 the modulo 5 components of PAN transformed , and PAN2 the modulo 2 cor..ponents of PAN transformed appear on lines e, f, g and h, respectively. A PIN comprised of eight characters is given in line i. The numerical representation of PIN, the numerical PIN transformed, PIN5 the modulo 5 component of the numerical PIN transformed and PIN2 the modulo 2 component of the numerical PIN trans for...ed appear on lines j, 1, k and m, respectively. The modulo 5 and the modulo 2 components of successive states of FSR A and FSR C during initialization are tabulated in Figure 16. The modulo 5 and the modulo 2 components of successive states of FSR A during re initialization are tabulate in Figure 17. It should be noted that the initialization of FSR A is designated to have been completed at C I k 0. In a like manner, the modulo 5 and modulo 2 components of successive states of FSR C during re initialization are tabulated in Figure 18. As shocir in Figure 18, 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 is stored in stages S2 S10 in the modulo 2 portion o SR C at CPI 28.During CPI 28 36, these bits, as read from right to left, are serially fed via stage S10 of register 84 in Figure 2 to transformation unit 38 in Figure 12. The succession of bits 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 is transformed to 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 whereby the second, third, fifth, eighth, and ninth bit as read from right to left are complemented, as they pass through transformation unit 38 to register 35 of FSR B, via multiplexer 90 in Figure 12. During CPI 37 39, 1 0 0 representing the base 5 digit 4 is supplied to register 35 of FSR B via multiplexer 90, where the right most bit is supplied first. The binary representation of the base 5 digit 4 is stored in stage 58 of register 71 in Figure 2 of the modulo 5 portion of FSRA during CPI 37.For the sake of brevity, states of FSR A and FSR C from CPI 30 through 107 are omitted in FIgures 17 and 18, respectively. The 12 bit sequence 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 is stored in stages 51 S12 of register 35 of FSR B at CPI 40, one CPI after the leftmost bit appears at the input of stage SI. Thus, as indicated in Figure 19, FSR B is initialized at CPI 40 and assumes a succession of states in accordance with the feedback function given previously, which characterizes a singular, non linear FSR, until it assumes the all l s terminal state. FSR B assumes the state 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 whereby decoder 40 in Figure 12 supplies an enabling control signal to pro cessor 45 at CPI 113 n 10. During CPI n 10 and 9 successive CPI s, denoted by n 9 through n l, corresponding A1,s and Ci15 as previously defined stored in the ith stages of FSR A and FSR C, respectively, are sequentially combined by processor 45 starting with A10 and C10. The two preselected processing functions as given in the previous example are employed by processor 45 in mapping the contents of FSR A and FSR C into an Offset Number during the 10 CPI window period, shown in Figure 19. The Offset Number for the PAN, PIN and IN, given in Figure 15 on lines e, i, and a, respectively, is D1 D2 ... D9 D10 4 6 4 6 4 9 2 4 3 7 As shown in the foregoing examples, FSR B participates in the mapping of the contents of FSR A and FSR C after re initiali zation into an Offset Number. For a given customized Generator, FSR B insures that the PAN PIN mapping into an Offset Number is irreversible such that PIN cannot be determined from known PAN Offset combinations. Let it be assumed that, the digit transformations, realized by transformation units 18, 23 and 28 are one to one. That is, the transformation of distinct digits are distinct. Also, the modulo 5 networks associated with the modulo 5 portions of FSR A and SR C, respectively, yield one to one mapping of the Present total state to the next state, under subseauently stated conditions, during initialization and re initialization of the modulo 5 portions of FSR A and FSR C. The total state of the modulo 5 portion of FSR A at CPI k, for example, is defined asEMI40.1 where the external input EAS is included as a component.Distinct total states which disagree in at least 1 of 9 of the leftmost components or in only 1 of the 2 componentsEMI40.2 or EAS are succeeded by distinct states where only the content o the register is considered for the feedback networks, characterized in Figures 4 and 7. Furthermore, let it be assumed that the preselected processing funtions associated with processor 45 in Figure 12 have the mathematical structure of a Latin square. The two processing functions, used in the foregoing examples1 have such a structure. One processing function is characterized by the table in Figure 13. The row and column entries correspond to the 10 different decimal values of A. and Ci, respectively.Each decimal digit 0 through 9 appears as an entry represented by Di, a function of A. and Ci, once and only once in each row and each column. 1 I The mapping D. described by the Latin square has a range consisting of the set 0, 1, ..., 9 . The domain of each argument A. and Ci is the same as the range of Di Furthermore, the i i mapping introduces no biases since each digit in the range appears as an entry an equal number of times namely, ten. Consideration is now given to the mapping of two hypothetical sets of PAN PIN combinations, without the inclusion of FSR B in the manner previously described. In each set thePAN s are 1010 distinct 10 digit numbers. Suppose PIN s are assigned to one set of 1010 PAN s, such that the 1010 distinctPAN PIN combinations result in 1010 different Offset Numbers.In the second set, suppose PIN s are assigned such that each of the 1010 distinct PRN PIN combinations map into the same OffsetNumber. The two sets of overall mapping are mathematically realizeable with a given Generator. The insertion of FSR B, as previously described, has the following focusing effect on the first set of PAN PIN 10 combinations, i.e., the one wherein 1010 different Offset Numbers are realized. The ten billion 1010 distinct PANPIN combinations map into less than 8 billion distinct OffsetNumbers. Subsets of distinct PAN PIN combinations map into the same Offset Number. PAN PIN combinations of disjoint subsets map into distinct Offset Numbers, and the size of these subsets are not uniform. Furthermore, at least 2 billion 10digit numbers will never appear as Offset Numbers. On the other hand, FSR B has the following defocusing effect on the second set of PAN PIN combinations, wherein, in the absence of FSR B, the same Offset Number would be produced for 1010 different PIN PAN combinations.The ten billion 1010 distinctPAN PIN combinations map into more than 6 billion distinct Of set Numbers. Again, disjoint subsets of distinct PAN PIN combinations that r.p into the same Offset Number are not of uniform size. Thus, FSR B guarantees that the overall PAN PIN mapping into Offset Numbers is irreversible. That is, PIN cannot be extracted from a known PAN Offset Number combination. A mechanical analog of an Offset Generator will now be described. The set of 1010 different 10 digit numbers is partitioned into 25 million disjoint subsets such that every lO ailt number belongs to one and only one subset. Each subset therefore contains 400 different numbers which belong to no other subset. Each of the 25 million subsets of 00 10digit numbers appear on the periphery of a wheel. Twenty five million such wheels have a common axis and each is free to rotate, Consider a second set of 25 million wheels with a totalitv of 1010 different 10 digit numbers similarly partitioned.The 400 10 digit numbers on each wheel in the first set are distributed on more than one wheel in the second set and vice versa. One wheel from each set is selected as a function of two arguments as follows f PAN, IN and g PIN, IN . respectively,After a wheel from each set is selected, one of 400 l0 digit numbers on each is selected as a function of two arguments as follows F PAN, IN and G PIN, I.x , respecrively, Each selected 10 digit number serves as a starting position for its respective wheel. The two wheels are then synchronously rotated for an interval of time which is a function of three arguments as follows h Pst, PIN, IN Two 10 digit numbers corresponding to the terminal positions of each respective wheels are mapped into one of 1010 possible l0 digit Offset Numbers. That isEMI43.1 tb N SEP A SEP SEP SEP NI SEP SEP SEP Offset SEP Number tb N A denotes the terminal number on the selected wheel from wheel set A, associated with PAN, and NI denotes the terminal number on the selected wheel from wheel set I associated with PIN. The functions f, g, F, G, h and the mapping are determined by the manufacturer by means of off the shelf integrated circuit selection in over 10100 ways. This consitutes the manufacturer s code MC. The 20 digit IN is selected by the card issuing 20 institution among 10 possible 20 digit sequences, as previously discussed. Clearly MC and IN are fixed for all Offset general tors, utilized by a particular institution. The correspondence betwen the digits of PAN, the digits of PIN, the 20 digits of IN, and the patterns of wheel selection and wheel rotation cannot be reversed. A pictorial representation of the mechanical analog of an Offset Generator including the focusing defocusing effect in the mapping of the Offset Number appears in Figure 20. Heretofore, the Offset Generator described accepted representations of alphanumeric information and generated representations of 10 digit decimal Offset Numbers. Transformations and FSR implementations are realizable for base m representation of an arbitrary length Attention is directed to the functional logic diagram of an r stage FSR in Figure 21 which is characterized by the following rt order modulo m recurrence relationship. ak c1 ak 1 c2 ak 2 ... cr ak r e mod m.Each stage is capable of assuming any one of m states, repre sented by the base m digits 0, l,....,m l. The constant multipliers c1, c2, ..., cr 1 are selected from the base m digits. Distinct states will have distinct successor states if multiplier c r and the external constant input e are each relatively prime to m. Two integers are relatively prine if their GreatestCommon Divisor gcd is . For example 8 and 9 are relatively prime although neither are prime . Tha is gcd 8, 9 1.The values of the constant multipliers c1, c2, ..., cr for an FSR configuration, which yields equal cycles of r component states are determined from the explanation of the binomial 1 m 1 x r 1 d1x d2xê ... drxr mod m Each ci is related to di as follows. ci m di mod m for 1 i r For example, 1 3x 4 1 0.x 2.xê 0.x 1.x4 mod 4 Thus, C1 0, C2 2, C3 0, C4 3 and ak 2ak 2 3ak 4 e mod 4 characterizes a 4 stage FSR which decomposes the totality of 44 or 255 4 digit base 4 numbers into cycles of equal length for e 1, 2 or 3. Note that gcd C4, 4 1 and gcd e, 4 1 where c4 3 and e 1, 2 or 3. Multipliers cl, c2, ..., cr in the rth order linear recurrence relationship characterizing equal length modulo 2 FSR cycles are tabulated in Figure 22 for values of r from 1 through 20. This is repeated for m 3, 4, 5 and 10 in Figures 23, 24, 25 and 26, respectively. The integer m 1 may be uniquely expressed except for order as the product of powers of distinct pries as follows. m p1s1 p2s2 ... pjsj.....If a particular prime, say pj is not a factor, then s. 0 and pj will not appear.The length l of the equal length cycles of a properly configured r stage modulo mFSR is computed from the prime power factors as follows.Assume 5 m pFor a given r, determine i such that r 1 satisfies the inequalities pi r 1 pi 1 Then 1 the length of each cycle of states is 2 mp1 ps i and he total number of cycles is mr NT ps r 1 i l For example, assume r 3 and m 4 2ê p 2, s 2 21 4 22 Thus 3 t 22 1 8 and NT 8 Fros foregoing discussions a 3rd order linear recurrence relationship for a 3 stage modulo 4 FSR which decomposes the 43 64 state space into 8 cycles of length 8 is ak 3ak 1 ak 2 ak 3 e mod 4 Note that gcd e, 4 must be 1. Thus e must be 1 or 3.The 5 cycles of states of length 8 for e 1 are tabulated in Figure 27. Each 3 place base 4 number appears once and belongs to one and only one cycle of states.The length l of the equal length cycles and the number of cycles NT for m 2 and values of r from 1 through 20 are tabulated in Figure 25. This is repeated for m 3, 4 and 5 in Figures 29, 30 and 31, respectively. For each m p5 where s 1, the length of the cycles are constant over the range of values of r where p r p .1 47 Starting at pi, NT increase ps fold for each increment of r over the foregoing range of values of r. At the transicion from one range to anoeher, increasing r from i l i l p 1 to p results in a p fold increase in l and ps 1 fold increase in NT. If s 1 i.e., m p ps 1 1, and no change occurs at the transition from one range to another. See Figures 29 through 31.To determine Z and NT for an m containing two or more prime factors, the following procedure is employed.Assume m p151 p252 p353 where sl, s2, s3 0Let m1 p1s1, m2 p2s2 and m3 p3s3For a given r, first determine l1, Q2 and l3, the cycle lengths corresponding to modulo m1, m2 and m3, respectively. Then mr l l1 l2 l3 and NT l The computation for N can also be done as follows. m1 m2 m3 Nr1 , Nr2 and NT3 l1 l2 l3 and Nr NT1 NT2 NT3For example, let r 10 and m 10 2.5 p1 2, s1 1, p2 5, s2 1 2 11 24 and l1 23 1 16 51 11 5ê and l2 51 1 25 l l1 l2 400 1010 NT 25 million 400 Also NT 210 2 26 1 2 510 NT2 58 55 NT 26 58 25 million.The length l of the equal length cycles and the number of cycles N1 for m 10 and values of r from 1 through 20 a e tabulated in Figure 32.The 10th order linear recurrence relationship for a 10 stage modulo 10 FSR which decomposes the 1010 state space into 25 million cycles of. length 400 is Ak 5Ak 2 2Ak 5 5Ak 8 9Ak 10 e mod 10 The multiplers c1 through c10 appear in the enclosed row lubeled r 10 inFigure 26 Since gcd e, 10 1, the external constant inpuc e must be 1, 3, 7 or 9. The implementation of the 10 stage modulo 10 FSR with binary devices could require 4 10 stage binary registers where the ith stage of each register stores an 8 4 2 1 binary representation of Ak i.Also required is an implementation of the switching function Ak f Ak 2, Ak 5, Ak 8, Ak 10, e which is 4 simultaneous switching functions of 20 switching variables i.e.,Ak and each argument is represented by 4 switching variables . Since m 10 2.5, the foregoing linear recurrence relationship may be decomposed as followsEMI49.1 These result from reducing each ten of the modulo 10 relationship modulo 5 and nodule 2, respectively. The reduction of e a base 10 digit for each of the 4 possible constant values where gcd e, 10 1 is as follows. e 1 3 9 e5 1 3 2 4 e2 1 1 1 1Note that e5 e mod 5 and e2 e mod 2. Furthermore gcd e5, 5 gcd e2, 2 1.Thus the expressions A 5 and Ak 2 characterize the 10 stage modulo 10 FSR decomposed into a 10 stage modulo 5 FSR and a 10 stage modulo 2 FSR, respec tively. The multipliers for each appear in the enclosed row labeled r w 10 in Figures 25 and 22, respectively. The behavior of the 10 stage decomposed modulo 10 FSR was fully described in connection with the operation of FSR A and FSo C. Decomposition reduces the complexity of the feedback function Ak as follows. EMI50.1 The 4 simultaneous switching functions of 20 switching variables associated with Ak are reduced to 3 simultaneous switching functions of 9 switching variables associated withEMI50.2 and a single switching function of 4 switching variables associated withEMI50.3 Recall thatEMI50.4 characterizes the output of the nodulo 5 feedback network 72 associated with the modulo 5 potion of FSR A in Figure 2 onlv when EA5 is 0. In Figure 4, entries under EA 0 areEMI50.5 whereEMI50.6 i.e., e5 2 .All other entries ofEMI50.7 under nonzero values of EA5 are in general nonlinear recurrence relations with argumentsEMI50.8 and EA5.SimilarlyEMI50.9 characterizes the output of the modulo 5 feedback network 82 associated with the modulo 5 portion of FSR C in Figure 2 only when EC5 0. In Figure 7 entries under EC5 0 areEMI50.10 whereEMI50.11 i.e., e5 3 1 .All other values ofEMI51.1 are in general nonlinear recurrence relations ith arguments EMI51.2 and It will be appreciated by those familiar with the art that an stage nodulo n FSR can nap external m ary input sequences into r place base m nunbers and autonomously generate equal length m ary cycles of states representable as r placc base m numbers .Furtherore, the r stage modulo m FSR can be implemented with binary switching elements and 2j binary registers where 2j l m By decomposing the modulo m FSR into modulo ciSi FSR s where Si are prime power factors of m , an overall reduction in the complexity of the feedback network is realizable. Furthermore, for many values of m the number of binary registers required is identical for the decomposed and nondecomposed versions of the modulo m FSR as is the case for m 1. The modulo S feedback networks 72 and 82, shown in Figure 2 are both implementable with Read Only Memories ROM s where the ROM s are realizations of 3 switching functions of 9 switching variables. Attention is directed to Figure 4 which specifies one possible modulo 5 feedback network for FSR A. The column of entries forEMI51.3 under EA5 equal to 0 is directly related to the choice of e5 namely, 1, 2, 3 or 4. Thus, there are exactly 4 distinct sets of base 5 values,EMI51.4 under EAS equal to 0, can assume. Each corresponds to a different decomposition of 510 9,765,625 l0 place base S numbers representing states into 390,625 cycles of length 25 as given in Figure 31.The remaining entries for 5 are chosen such that distinct total statesEMI51.5 which disagree in at least 1 of 9 of the leftmost components or only 1 of the 2 componentsEMI51.6 or EA5 are succeeded bv distinct states where only the content of the register is considered . The total number of ways the 125 entries forEMI51.7 can be selected whereby previously described distinct total states are succeeded by distinct register states is 4 43 42 41 40 5 9 x 1032 Thus, the modulo 5 feedback network e.g., ROY.. associated withFSR A can be any one among a number exceeding 9 x 1032. Similarly the modulo 5 feedback network associated with FSR C can be among a number exceeding 9 x 1032. The modulo 2 feedback networks 75 and 85, shown inFigure 2 are unique modulo 2 summers characterized by the 10th order linear recurrence relationshipsEMI52.1 respectively Distinct modulo 2 total states which disagree in at least 1 of 9 of the leftmost components or only 1 of the 2 rightmost components, have distinct successor register states, and the linear relationships hold for both values i.e., 0 and 1 of the external inputs EA2 and EC2 . Equal length cycles result when the external input EA2 for Ak 2 and EC2 is 0. This 10 corresponds to a unique decomposition of 2 1,024 l0 place base 2 nutters representing states into 26 64 cycles of length 16 as given in Figure 28. The constant external input 1 when EA2 and EC2 are 0 is e2 which is relatively prime to 2 i.e., gcd 1,2 1 as required. A mechanical analog of a modulo 10 FSR synthesized with a modulo 5 and a modulo 2 FSR is shown in Figure 33. The mechanical analog corresponds to a 10 stage FSR that generates equal length cycles of state of length 400. It is comprised of a pair of meshed gears. The larger gear has 25 gear teeth corresponding to the 25 states of a cycle of a l0 stage modulo 5 FSR that generates equal length cycles of states of length 25. The smaller gear has 16 teeth corresponding to the 16 states of a cycle of a 10 stage modulo 2 FSR that generates equal length cycles of states of length 16. The teeth at the point of contact each represent the current state of their respective FSR s. The initial state of an FSR is represented by the tooth joined to gear s center by a scribe line.The alignment of the two scribe lines corresponds to the FStX being in or returning to theirinitialstates. Given that the scribe lines are aligned i.e., the two FSR s are in their initial state , the number of teeth of each gear tha must pass the point of contact before realignment of the scribe lines corresponds to the cycle length of the synthesized modulo 10 FSR. Tnis is equal to the Least Cordon Nultiple LCM of 25 and 16.Since 25 to 16 are relatively prime i.e., gcd 25,16 1 , Li 25,16 is equal to the product of 25 and 16 or 400. The pair of meshed gears whose ordered pairs of teeth in contact represent a 10 place base 10 number corresponds to one of the 25 million wheels in Figure 20 with 400 10 place base 10 numbers on its periphery. The digit transformation units 18, 23 and 28 shown inFigure 1, can be realized for any base m number system. Base 10 digit transformations are herein specifically discussed. LetY8Y4Y2Y1 denote the binary representation of adecimal digit in an 8 4 2 1 format. The binary representation of the transformed decimal digit also in an 8 4 2 1 format is denoted by y8y4y2y1. Each of the digit transformations is a one to one onto transformation on the set oE decimal digits. Refer to Figure 3 . The Binary Coded Decimal BCD to decimal decoder accepts y8y4y2y1 as an innut. If the input represents the decimal digit i, then Zi among the 10 outputs Z0, Z1, ... Z9 and only Zi assumes a state value of 1. All other outputs assume a state value of 0.The decimal co BCD encoder accepts z0z1 ... Zg as an input where one and only one of the components is at state value 1, say zj. All other components are at statevalue 0 and the output y8y4y2y1 represents the decimal digit j in an 8 4 2 1 format. By connecting each output of the BCD to deci3al decoder to one and only one input of the decimal to BCD encoder a particular one to one onto transformation on the set of decimal digits is realized. The transformation in Figure 34 represents one of 10 3,628,800 possible one to one onto transformations on a set of decimal digits.The transformation of 1 0 0 0 to O 1 1 1 4 .e., decimal 8 to 7 is illustrated. Heavily drawn input lines correspond to state values of I. All other inputs and outputs are at state value 0. This particular configuration transforms representations of the decimal digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 to 4,3,1,5,S,0,9,2,7 and 6, respectively. Corresponding inputs and outputs of the BCD to decimal decoder and decimal to BCD encoder are tabulated in Figure 35 for the configuration inFigure 34. The one to one onto transformations on the set cf decimal digits can be synthesized from base 5 and base 2 digit transformations as shown inFigure 36.The binary representation of a decimal digit Y3Y4Y2Y1 is partitioned into y8y4y2 and Y1. The former is the representation of a base 5 digit in a 4 2 1 format, whereas the latter is a representation of a base 2 digit. A binary to base 5 decoder accepts Y8Y4Y2 as an input. If the input rePresents the base 5 digit i, when Xi among the 5 outputs X0, X1, ... X4 and only Xi assumes a state value of I. All other outputs assume a state value of 0.The base 5 to binary encoder accepts . s1 ... x4 as an input where only one of the components is at state value 1, say xj, All other inputs are at state value 0 and the output y8y4y2 represents the base 5 digit j in a 4 2 eormat. fly connecting each output of the decoder to one and only one input ot the encoder, a particular one to one onto transformation on the set of base j discs is realized. Similarly, the binary to base 2 decoder accepts Y1 as an input. If Y1 is 0, then W0 land W1 t 0. If Y1 is 1, then W1 0 and No 1.The base 2 to binary decoder accepts W0W1 10 or 10 as an input and supplies the output y1 O or 1, respectively. The input combination Y8Y4Y2 Y1 to the decoders represents a decimal digit D. Whereas the output combination Y8Y4Y2 Y1 represents the transformed decimal digit d. The transformation of 1 0 0 1 to 0 1 1 0 i.e., decimal 9 to 6 is illustrated inFigure 36. The configuration is one of 5 2 240 possible one to one onto transformations on a set of decimal digits synthesized fro the partitioned base 2 and base 2 transformations.Note that partitioned transformations offer a reduction in the complexity of implementation at the expense of a significant reduction in the number of realizable one to one onto transfornations. Corresponding inputs and outputs of the base 5 and base 2 decoders and encoders are tabulated in Figure. 37. The resulting synthesized transformation is tabulated in Figure 35 where D 2X W and 2X W d. Consider the bit serial transformation unit 38 appearing in Figure 1 and 12. For explanation purposes, transformation unit 38 uas shown separately from register 35 of FSR B. Attention is now directed to Figure 39, where trans information unit 38 and register 35 are integrated. Transformation unit 38 is ccmprised of nine fixed switches t4 through t12 whose poles are respectively connected to the nine Exclusive OR gates whose outputs are respective inputs to stages S4 through S12 of register 35. Each of the other inputs to the nineExclusive OR gates are the outnuts of stages 53 through Sll, respectively. As previously discussed, 9 bits are serially shifted from S10 of register 84 the modulo 2 portion of FSR C via multiplexer 90 during CPI 28 through 36.During CR1 37, 38 and 39, three bits stored in register 71 of FSR A and reDresenting a particular base 5 digit are successively supplied to register 35 via multiplexer 90. With reference to the integrated transformation unit 38 and register 35, let X4, X5, ... X12 represent the bits emanating from S10 of register 84. Let X1, X2, X3 represent the bits emanating from register 71 and which were stored in stage 58 during cPI 37 . Bit x12 enters register 35 first and ultimately initializes stage S12. If switch ti is in the left position, ti is at state value 0 and each bit entering stage Si from stage S i 1 is unchanged.If switch t. is in the right position, t. is at state value 1 and each bit i 1 entering Si from stage S i l is complemented. Let T4 t4 T5 t4 t5 T6 t4 t5 t6 T12 t4 t5 t6 ... t12 where summations are reduced modulo 2. The contents of stages 51 through S12 after initialization are X1, X2, X3, X4 T4, X5 T5, ..., X12 T12The fixed switch setting in Figure 39 corresponds to t4 t5 ... t12 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1Thus T4 T5 .. T12 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 and X4 X5 ... X12 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 is transformed to 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 as shown in the first of two previous examples. Note that distinct 9 bit strings are transformed onto distinct 9 bit strings. Thus the transformation realized by transformation unit 38 is a one to one onto transformation. Furthermore, the fixed switch setting represents one of 29 512 possible bit serial transformations. It remains to enumerate the number of ways corresponding Ai s of FSR A and C. .5 of SR C can be combined by Drocessor 45 shown in Figure 1 and 12 to yield Offset digits Di Two preselected Drocessing functions were utilized in connection with the two examples presented. One used in the generation ofD10 invoked the synthesized modulo 10 FSR s feedback digit during the generation of equal length cycles. Thus the number of ways D10 can be thus derived is equal to the number of ways nodulo 10 equal length cycles can be derived.The remaining Offset digits Di are mapped from corresponding Ai s and Ci s in accordance with a mathematical structure known as a Latin square. The 10 by 10 array in Figure 13 as previously indicated is an example of a Latin square.Each of the 10 decimal digits appears as an entry in each row and column exactly once. This is known as a Latin square of order 10. The nunber of distinct Latin squares of order 10 has not yet been enumerated. It is known that the number of distinct Latin squares of order n, narelv L is Ln n n 1 Rn where R is the number of reduced Latin squares of order n. A reduced Latin n square oE order n has the entries in the first row and first column in natural order i.e., 0, 1, ..., n 1 . Rn has been determined for values of n from 1 through 9. These are tabulated in Figure 40.R0 in factored form is R9 221 3ê 5,231 3,824,477 Multiplying R0 by 9 8 where 91 362,880 and 8 4O,320Gives Lg the number of distinct Latin squares of order 9. Though L10 has not yet been determined the lower bound of L10 is known. That is L10 10 . 9 ... 2 6.586 10 The mappings characterized by Latin squares of order 10 of order pairs Ai, Ci into D. can be realized by 8 in by 4 ou. ROM s. Referring again to Figure 1, the output of processor 45, which is the Offset Number, is supplied to the output Unit 46. As previously stated, the latter may include display means to display the Of set Number and or means for recording the Offset Number on the magnetic stripe of the card. Thus, the card is assumed to have both the PAN and the Offset Number reccrded thereon. If desired, the card s expiration date and other information may be recorded on the card. When the card is to be used, it is inserted into a Card Verifier or simply a Verifier which in most aspects is siniliar to the Generator, heretofore described. The Verifier, shown in Figure 41, includes circuitry identical to all the circuitry shown in Figure l, except for the input PAN Unit 2 1 and the output unit 46. This circuitry is represented in Figure 41 by the box, designated Generator Circuitry. Instead of input PAN Unit 21, the verifier includes a card reader 102, whose function is to read automatically the Offset Number, the PAN and any other information recorded on the magnetic stripe when the card is inserted. Once the card is inserted, digits of the Offset Number which are read out are supplied to an Offset Number register 104, wherein it is stored for use, as will be described hereafter. The digits of the PAN which are readout are sequentially supplied to the transformation unit 23 See Figure 1 and are ultimately stored in FSR A, as heretofore described. The latter mentioned elements are in the block, designated Generator Circuitry. As to the IN, it is entered into Verifier by one or more of the officers of the institution before the Verifier is enabled and can be used. Thus, the IN is present in storage unit 15. The entering of the PAN takes place, asynchronously, con trolled by clock pulses which are derived from recorded digital information by the card reader, when the card is read. The card user enters a PIN via Unit 27 see Figure 1 wherein after transformation it is stored in FSR C, as heretofore described. Only after both the PAN and PIN are in registers A and C respectively, does the Verifier enter the synchronous mode, and generate an Offset Number which is stored in a second OffsetNumber register 105. When the latter is loaded with the entireOffset Number a comparator 110, to which the two Offset Numbers in registers 104 and 105 are supplied, is activated. It compares both Offset Numbers in registers 10 and 105. Only if the two are identical does comparator 110 supply a verification signal to output Unit 112. On the other hand, if the two are not identical a signal is supplied indicating the absence of identity. To determine the PIN from the PAN and Offset Number is impossible, particularly due to the focusing and defocusing effect which is produced by the incorporation of FSR B, as heretofore described. Even without FSR B, without the various transformation units and even if the transformed IN in storage unit 15 were known, with multistage FSR A and FSR C, the task of determining the secret PIN of the original card owner from the recorded PAN and Offset Number requires the posession of a generator or verifier and is so time consuming, as to be impossible or at least highly unprofitable. If desired the output Unit 112, in addition to providing an indication whether the two Offset Numbers are identical or not may display other information recorded on the card s magnetic stripe, such as card expiration date, parity errors in the recorded digital information or any other information of interest. It should be pointed out that a person may choose and use the same PIN, when obtaining cards of different institutions However, the Offset Number is related to PAN, assigned by the institution, IN secretly selected by the institution as well as the card user s secretly selected PIN through a unique set of transfornations and mapping. This relationship is unique to te institution and is s guaranteed by the unique set of trans formations and mapping. Thus, even if a person may choose the same PIN, for each card a different Offset Number will result. It should be appreciated that the foregoing description is of preferred embodiments. The FSR B is incorporated to provide focusing and defocusing effects so that the process becomes irreversible. That is, it is impossible to determine the secret PIN from the known Offset Number and the PAN, even if the transformed I were known. Also, the various transformation units such as units 18, 23 and 28 which transform the entered IN, PAN and PIN, respectively, were added to further enhance the system s operation. It should be clear, however, that if a level of protection, less than that achievable with anr of the preferred embodiments, is acceptable, one or more or the features which provide the added system protection may be eliminated. For example, FSR B may be eliminated.In such a case, once PAN and PIN are entered into FSR A and C respectively, and the system enters the synchronous mode,processor 45 may be activated, at any selected CPI during the synchronous operation, to produce the Offset Number. Also, the mapping of the Offset Number from the PAN and PIN may be performed other than hereto fore described, i.e. other than with the Latin square. For example, corresponding digits in FSR A and FSR C may be multi plied and reduced modulo 10, to represent the digits Di of the Offset Number. Such z mapping , unlike that characterized by a Latin Square would be a many to one into mapping. If desired , all or several of the transformation units may be e1irnated. Likewise, if desired the use of an IN may be elimin ated. Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated herein, it is recognized that modifications and equivalents may readily occur to those skilled in the art and, consequently, it is intended that the claims be interpreted to cover such modifications and equivalents.
