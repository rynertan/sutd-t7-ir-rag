# AN ELECTROSURGICAL PENCIL

## Abstract
The present invention is comprised of an electrosurgical pencil of the type where current is provided from an electrosurgical generator to the blade of the pencil through a hot lead whenever a switching circuit is activated by interconnecting the hot lead with a switching lead which also runs from the pencil to the generator. The pencil isolates the hot lead from the blade at all times when the switching circuit is not also activated by that pencil. Accordingly, when the generator is caused to transmit current by the activation of one pencil, the current will not reach the blade of other pencils connected to the same generator.
