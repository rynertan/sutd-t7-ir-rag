# METHOD FOR PRODUCING EPOXIDES AND GLYCOLS FROM ALKENES

## Abstract
A method is describod for the manufacture of epoxides or glycols from olefins. An olefin is contacted with a reaction mixture of a halogonating enzyme, an oxydizing agent and a halide ion source, for a sufficient period to convert the olefin to a halohydrin. The halohydrin is then converted to an epox ide or glycol.
