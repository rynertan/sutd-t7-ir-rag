# Casting of articles with predetermined crystalline orientation.

## Abstract
A method and means for use in producing articles having a predetermined crystalline orientation such as single cryst als The technique involves the use of a ceramic mold 60 mounted on a chill plate 48 with the mold defining a cavity 34 tilted at an angle between about 5 and 75 relative to the vertical. One or more seed crystals 30 are supported adja cent the chill plate and the orientation of the crystal is selected to provide a desired orientation in the resulting casting. The method results in improved solidification control, particularly with reference to avoiding defects caused by shrinkage.
