CR2 andY1, Y2 and Y3 together are cycloalkyl which is substituted by a hydroxy group which is preferably separated by 3 carbon atoms from the hydrantoin ring, have similar pharmacological activity to natural prostaglandins. We have now discovered a class of compounds which have useful pharmocological activity and which are structurally distinct from the compounds disclosed in Cffenlegungsschrift No. 2724948. Accordingly the present invention provides a compound o formula I EMI2.1 wherein X is 0, S or H2 Y is CH2 CH2 , CH CH or C C n is 1 to 5 R1 is C1 4 alkyl is hydrogen or C1 4 alkyl is is a hydroxy or protected hydroxy R4 is C1 9 alkyl, C3 8 cycloalkyl or C3 8 cycloalkyl C1 6 alkyl and R5 is hydrogen or C1 6 alkyl and salts thereof. Particularly suitable compounds within formula I include those where X is 0. Preferably Y is CH2 CH2 or cis CH CH . Preferably n is 3, 4 or 5, in particular 4. Suitable examples of R1 include methyl and ethyl. Suitable examples of R2 include hydrogen, methyl and ethyl. More suitably R2 is hydrogen or methyl, preferably methyl. Suitable protected hydroxyl groups R3 include readily hydrolysable groups such as acylated hydroxy groups in which the acyl moiety contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example the acetoxy group and hydroxy groups etherified by readily removable inert groups such as the benzyl group or like groups. Preferably R3 is hydroxyl. Suitable groups R4 when R4 is an alkyl group include C49 alkyl groups. Such C4 9 alkyl groups may be straight chain alkyl groups, such as n butyl, npentyl, n hexyl and n heptyl, or may be alkyl groups branched by one or two methyl groups at the same or different carbon atoms . Thus for example, R4 may be a group a12R7, CH CH3 R7 or C CH3 2R7 wherein R7 is a straight chain alkyl group such that the carbon content of the resultant group R4 is 4 to 9. In general preferred groups R when R4 is an alkyl group include straight chain pentyl, hexyl and heptyl groups. Of these, straight chain hexyl is often the most useful. Other preferred groups k4 include groups CH CH3 R7 and C CH3 2R7 wherein R7 is straight chain butyl, pentyl and hexyl. Other suitable examples of R4 when R4 is an alkyl group include the lower alkyl groups, that is when R4 is a C14 alkyl group. When R4 is or contains a C3 B cycloalkyl moiety, the moiety may be cyclopropyl. The moiety may also preferably be a C5 8 cycloalkyl moiety in particular a cyclo hexyl moiety. Examples of suitable C1 6 alkyl moieties when R4 is a C3 8 cycloalkyl C1 6 alkyl group include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and pentyl. Suitable examples of R5 include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n and iso propyl, n , sec and tert butyl. Some of the compounds of formula I may form conventional salts. Such salts include those with alkali and alkaline earth metals, including suitably sodium and potssium, and acid addition salts when X is H2. From the aforesaid it will be senn that one particularly suitable group of compounds within formula I is of formula II EMI4.1 wherein X, Y R1 and R5 are as defined in formula I R1 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl and R4 is C1 9 alkyl and salts thereof. In formula II suitably X is 0. Suitably Y is CH2 CH2 or cis CH CH. Suitably R1 is methyl. RÚ2 is more suitably hydrogen or methyl, preferably methyl. While RÚ4 may be a C1 9 alkyl group, it is normal4ly a C4 9 alkyl group. In such cases suitable and preferred straight chain and branched groups R4 include those previously described as suitable and preferred for the group R4 and R4 is a C4 9 alkyl group. Such preferred groups R4 include straight chain pentyl, hexyl, and heptyl and of these normally the most useful is straight chain hexyl. Other preferred groups RÚ4 include CH CH3 RÚ7 ANDC CH3 2RÚ7 wberein RÚ7 is straight chain butyl, pentyl or hexyl. Suitably Rg is hydrogen, m ethyl or ethyl. A further group of compounds of interest within formula I is of formula III EMI5.1 wherein X, Y,R1 and R5 are as defined irs formula I 1 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl 4 is a group of formula IV EMI6.1 wherein T is a bond, or a C alkylene group which may be straight chain or branched by one or two methyl groups at the same or different carbon atoms and r is O to 3 . and salts thereof. In formula III suitably X is 0. Suitably Y is CH2 CH2 or cis CH CH . Suitably R1 is methyl. RÚ2 is more suitably hdrogen or methyl, preferably methyl. In formula IV often T will be a group CH2 qwherein q is O to 4, preferably 0. Also suitably r is 1. Suitably Rg is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl. It will of course be realised that the compounds of the formula I have asymmetric centres, and thus are capable of existing in a number oi stercoisomeric forms. The invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms, and to mixtures thereof. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated one from the other by the usual methods. The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I which process comprises the cyclisation of a compound of formula V EMI7.1 wherein the variable groups are as hereinbefore defined and X is O or S and thereafter if desired or necessary converting X, Y, R1, R3 and R5 in the thus formed compound into other variables X, Y, R1, R3 and R5. When R5 is alkyl in the compound of formula V , then the compound of the formula V is conveniently prepared in situ during the reaction of a compound of the formula VI EMI7.2 with R5NCX wherein R5 is alkyl and X is O or S. This preferred process is suitably carried out under reflux in an inert solvent such as benzene and the like. It should be stated that when in this reaction R5 is a sterically hindered group then this reaction may proceed only as far as the uncyclised compound of formula V , in which case the necessary cyclisation of the compound V can be achieved with a strong base, such a sodium hydride or sodium ethoxide, in a dry organic solvent. Sodium ethoxide in benzene, or potassium t butoxide in toluene, benzene or hexamthyl phosphoramide are suitable reagents. When R5 is hydrogen in the compound of formula V , then the compound of formula V is conveniently formed in situ during the reaction of a compound of formula IV with a salt M CNX wherein N is a metal ion, preferably potassium, in the presence of acid.The acid for this reaction, which yields a compound of formula I , is suitably provided by using an acid addition salt of the compound of formula VI , or by carrying out the reaction in aqueous acid. I ntermediates of the formula VI may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VII EMI8.1 wherein the variables are as defined in formula I , and R2 and R3 may also together form an oxo group, with a carbonyl reducing agent. The necessary reduction of a compound of the formula VII may be carried out with any of the usual carbonylreducing agents under conditions which will be apparent to the skilled man. Suitable examples of carbonyl reducing agents are borohydrides, such as sodium or lithium borohydrides, which may be used in a solvent such as diglyme, a lower alcohol or an ether. Intermediates of the formula VII may be prepared by methods described for the intermediates to compounds forming the subject matter of published European PatentApplication No 79301145.3, or by methods analogous thereto. Alternatively, intermedztes of the formula VII wherein R2 and R3 together form an oxo group may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIII EMI9.1 wherein the variables are as hereinbefore defined, with a compound of formula IX EMI9.2 wherein R4 is as hereinbefore defined. The present invention also provides an alternative process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I wherein X is 0 which process comprises reacting a compound of the formula X EMI10.1 wherein the variables are as defined in formula VII with a carbonyl reducing agent, and thereafter if desired or necesary conveting Y, R1, R3 and R5 in the thus formed compound into other variables Y, R1, R3 and R5. The reduction of a compound of formula X may be carried out as hereinbefore described for the reduction of compounds of the formula VII . The compounds of formula X are within the subject matter of published European Patent Application No 79301145.3 and their preparation is fully described therein. The conversion of a compound of the formula I to another compound of the formula I wherein X, Y,R3 and or R5 are altered, when desired or necessary, may be achieved in any conventional manner. For example compounds wherein X is S may be converted to compounds wherein X is H2 by reduction.This reductive desulphurisation may be carried out in the presence of a suitable conventional hydrogenation catalyst, such as Raney nickel, under conventional conditions for such reactions. For example a solution of the chosen compound of the formula I wherein X is S in an organic solvent may be added to a refluxing suspension of the catalyst in a similar solvent. Also for example if desired compounds whereinY is C C may be reduced to compounds wherein Y is cis CH CH in known manner. Suitably this reaction is carried out using catalytic hydrogeiiation, such asLindlar catalysis. When Y is CH CH , it may be reduced to CH2 CH2 in known manner, suitably Using catalytic hydrogenation such as transition metal catalysis. Similarly protected R3 hydroxy moSeties may be deprotected in conventional manner. For example when R3 is a benzyloxy group, the benzyl group may readily be removed by hydrogenolysis. Thus it Inlay be scen that 1protected hydroxy compounds of the fomula I are useful intermediates in the preparation oi the corresponding free hydroxy compounds of the formula I . Also when a compound of the formula I contains an acidic hydrogen atom s , salts thereof may be prepared in conventional manner for example by reacting te compound of the formula I with the required base. For salts of compounds wherein R5 is llydronell, the base should be a strong base such as for example sodium in an alcohol, such as ethanol, or the like. It will be appreciated that when X is H2, Y may conveniently be CH,CH2 . Compounds of the formula I have particularly useful pharmacological activity. For example compounds of the formula I have anti gastric secretion activity anti ulcer activity activity on smooth muscle, such as vascular activity, eg anti hypertensive activity, effects on the respiratory tract, eg bronchodilation activity, anti fertility activity and gastrointestinal smooth muscle activity platelet aggregation inhibition activity and or cardiac activity, eg anti arrhythmic activity and or anti hypertensive activity. Compounds of the formula I may accordingly be used in the treatment of the corresponding disorders in humans and animals. The compounds of the formula I are especially useful bronchodilation agents. In general it may be said that compounds of the formula I have a range of pharmacological activities similar to those shown by the natural prostaglandins, but that their activity profiles tend to be rather more selective, so that each compound tends to have a major activity readily ascertained by routine pharmacological tests. The invention therefore also provides a pharma ceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of the formula I also have good stability. In order to utilise the selectivity of activity found with compounds of the formula I , normally a given compound will be used in the treatment of the disorder corresponding to the compounds major activity that is, the disorder for which the compound has the lowest active dose and will accordingly be formulated into the corresponding pharmaceutical composition, and administered in a manner conventional for treatment of that disorder. It may also of course be possible with compounds having one or more further pronounced activities to formulate and use the compound for those further activities as well as for the major activity, provided that there is no undesirable pharmacological interaction between the different activities, or that separation of the different activities can be obtained by a difference in the formulation or in the mode of administration. The composition may be in the forms of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges or liquid preparations, such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspension. Tablets and capsules for oral ac lnillistratioJlluay be in unit dose presentation form, and iiay contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tabletting lubricants, disintegrants, and acceptable wetting agents and the like. The tablets may be coated according to methods well Icnown in normal pharmaceutical practice.Oral liquid preparations may be in the orni of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product lor recollstitution with w lter or otller suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations mat contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non a ueous vehicles which may include edible oils , preservatives, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents, and the like. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilising the compound of the formula I and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in th2 vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved for injection and filter sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in sul stantially the same manner except that the compounds is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilisation cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. When appropriate, the compositions of this invention may be presented as an aerosol for oral administration, or as a microfine powder for insufflation. As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned. It will of course be ralised that the precise dosage used in the treatment of any of the hereinbefore described disorders will. depend on the actual compound of the formula I used, and also on other factors such as the seriousness of the disorder being treated. The invention also provides a. method of treatment and or prophylaxis of disorders in human being or anirnals which comprises the administration to the sufferer of an effective amount of a compound of the formula I .Normally however the compounds will be used in the therapy of human disorders. The following Examples illustrate thule preparation of compounds of the formula I and the following descriptions illustrate the preparation of intermediates thereto.
