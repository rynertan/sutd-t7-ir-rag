# Cold forming apparatus.

## Abstract
A cold forming apparatus adapted to form simultaneously a plurality of either external or internal straight spline or gear type teeth on a cylindrical workpiece 20 carried on a movable ram 92 . In one embodiment the apparatus includes a plurality of radially disposed pivotally mounted teeth forming blades 170 which are disposed around the axis of movement of a linearly movable ram 92 , whereby when the ram moves in one direction past the teeth forming blades 170 , the blades 170 are engaged by an interference contact with the workpiece 20 carried on the ram 92 and the teeth forming blades 170 are moved over the external surface of the workpiece 20 in a rolling contact action so as to displace the material of the workpiece 20 between each tooth forming edge of each of the blades 170 . The material on the external surface of the workpiece 20 is formed around the radius of each of the tooth forming edges of each of the forming blades 170 on a line with the configuration of each tooth forming edge. In another embodiment the apparatus includes a plurality of radially disposed, rotary type teeth forming dies 260 .
