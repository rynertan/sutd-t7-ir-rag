# Double antibody conjugate.

## Abstract
Reagents and methods are described for an immunoas say test of increased sensitivity and decreased complexity employing an immunoglobulin specific for an antigen 2 naturally or artificially placed upon the surface of an indicator particle 1 coupled through the use of a heterobi functional coupling reagent 3 to a second antibody 4 of differing specificity and specific for the antigen 5 , to be detected. In a preferred embodiment, a heterobifunctional coupling agent couples via a sulfhydryl group, a univalent immunoglobulin specific for the surface antigens on erythro cytes to a second multivalent immunoglobulin through an amide linkage with the latter immunoglobulin wherein said second immunoglobulin is specific for hepatitis B surface antigen.
