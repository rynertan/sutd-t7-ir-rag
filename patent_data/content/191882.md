## Description
METHOD FOR SOLDERING AN ELECTRICAL PRODUCT The present invention relates to a method for soldering an electrical product, wherein a coating of a specific fluoro compound is formed along the peripheral portion around the soldering portion to prevent the soldering flux from penetrating to or depositing on said peripheral portion. For soldering various parts, such as switches, capacitors, connectors or resistors, to a printed circuit board, or an integrated circuit IC to an IC socket, it is common to employ flux pretreatment to improve the solderability. Such a flux contains an acidic component or non conductive component, and if it deposits on a portion other than the soldering portion, it is likely to cause corrosion or conduction failure. Accordingly, it is extremely important to restrict the application of the flux treatment to the necessary portion. There has been proposed to use a masking tape which is designed to protect a non soldering portion and to be pealed off after the soldering operation.However, this is a major factor which prevents the automation of the soldering treatment In the case of a printed circuit board, soldering is frequently applied to through holes, and the flux is likely to penetrate to the interior of the electrical product through such through holes.Therefore, it is required not only to prevent the deposition of the flux but also to prevent the penetration of the flux Accordingly, it is an object of the present inventio to provide a method for soldering an electrical product, whereby the soldering flux is prevented from penetrating to or depositing on the peripheral portion around the soldering portion. Namely, the present invention provides a method for soldering an electrical product with a soldering flux, wherein an aqueous dispersion or an organic solvent solution of a compound containing a polyfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroether group having from 4 to 21 carbon atoms is applied to a peripheral portion around the soldering portion and dried to form a coating of said compound so as to prevent the soldering flux from penetrating to or depositing on said peripheral portion. Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments.

There is no particular restriction to the unsaturated ester containing a polyfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroether group having from 4 to 21 carbon atoms or forming the compoundII or III. However, the following acrylates or methacrylates are preferred.CF3 CF2 4CH2OCOC CH3 CH2CF3 CF2 6 CH2 2OCOC CH3 CH2 CF3 C F2 6COOCH CH2 CF3 CF2 7CH2CH2OCOCH CH2EMI4.2 CF3 CF2 7SO2N C3H7 CH2 20COCH CH2 CF3 CF2 7 CH2 4OCOCH CH2 CF3 CF2 7SO2N CH3 CH2 2OCOC CH3 CH2CF3 CF2 7So2N C2H5 CH2 2oCocH cH2 CF3 CF2 7CONH CH2 2OCOCH CH2EMI4.3 EMI4.4 EMI5.1 CF3 CF2 8 CH2 2OCOCH CH2 CF3 CF2 8 CH2 2OCOC CH3 CH2 CF3 C F2 8CONH CH2 2OCOC CH3 CH2 EMI5.2 H CF2 10CH2OCOCH CH2 CF2Cl CF2 10CH2OCOC CH3 CH2 C3F7OCFCF3COOC 2H 4NHCOCH CH2 C3F7O C3F6O 2CFCF3COOC2H4OCOCH CH2EMI5.3 The compound II may be an epoxy compound such asEMI5.4 where Y is from RTI ID 5.7 0 to 100. The compound copolymerizable with the above unsaturated ester may be selected from a wide range of compounds so long as it does not adversely affect the method of the present invention. For instance, it is possible to copolymerize, as a constituting unit in the copolymer, one or more polymerizable compounds containing no perfluoroalkyl group, such as ethylene, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, vinyl fluoride, vinylidene halide, styrene, a methylstyrene, p methylstryene, acrylic acid and its alkyl ester, methacrylic acid and its alkyl ester, poly oxyalkylene acrylate, poly oxyalkylene methacrylate, acrylamide, rethacrylamide, diacetoneacrylamide, methyloldiacetone acrylamide,N methylol acrylamide, vinyl alkyl ether, halogenated alkyl vinyl ether, vinyl alkyl ketone, butadiene, isoprene, chlorcprene, glycidyl acrylate, benzyl methacrylate, benzyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, maleic anhydride, aziridinyl acrylate or methacrylate, and vinyl carbazole. The ratio for the copolymerization of such a copolymerizable component to the unsaturated ester containing the polyfluoroalkyl or po yfluoropolyether group is usually from 1 to 70 by weight, preferably from 10 to 50 by weight. To obtain the compound II or III of the present invention, it is common tc employ a solution polymerization wherein the starting material polymerizable compounds are dissolved in a proper organic solvent, and the polymerization is conducted by the action of the polymerization initiating source e.g. a peroxide or an azo compound soluble in the organic solvent used, or an ionizing radiation . As a solvent suitable for the solution polymerization, there may be mentioned toluene, ethyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoroethane, tetrachlorodifluoroethane or methylchloroform. In the present invention, the above menticned compounds I, II and III may be employed alone or in combination as a mixture of two or more different kinds.In the case of a mixture of the compounds I, II and III, it is preferred to use the compound IT as the major component, since the performance for the prevention of the penetration or deposition of the flux is thereby high. The fluorine content in the compound I, II or III is preferably at least 205 by weight, more preferably at least 50 by weight. These compounds are d versed in water or dispersed or dissolved in an organic solvent, and such an aqueous dispersion or organic solution is applied by spraying or brushing to the non soldering surface, particularly to the portion where the flux is likely to penetrate to or deposit on. Otherwise, the treatment may be made by dipping the non soldering surface in such a dispersion or solution.As the organic solvent, there may be mentioned a ketone such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, an ester such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate or isoamyl acetate, an ether such as diethyl ether or dioxane, or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methyl chloroform, trichloroe nylene, tetrachloroethylene, tetrachloi difluoroethane, l,l,2 trichloro l,2,2 trifluoroethane or methaxylene hexafluoride. These solvents may be used alone or in combination as a mixture of two or more different kinds. A spray composition may be prepared by adding a propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane, monofluorotrichloromethane or dichloro tetrafluoroethane to the above solution and the mixture is filled in a proper container.It is advantageous to conduct spray treatment in that after the treatment, the composition immediately dries up and exhibits excellent prevention of the penetration or deposition of the flux.The amount of the compound I, II or III in the solvent or water is usually from 0.01 to 10 by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 2 by weight. If the compound I, II or III is applied to the through holes in a printed circuit board to form a coating of the compound, the flux will be prevented from penetrating via the through holes to the side of the printed circuit board on which parts are to be mounted, whereby corrosion can be prevented. Further, when the soldering is applied to the terminals or lead wires from such parts as switches, capacitors, connectors or resistors, it is likely that the flux penetrates via the terminals or lead wires to the interior of such parts.Accordingly, when the flux contains a non conductive component, a failure in the electric conduction is likely to be led in the interior of the parts. It is possible to prevent the penetration of the flux by forming the coating of the present invention at the peripheral portion around the soldering portion, e.g. in the vicinity of the base portion from which the terminals or lead wires extend. On the other hand, if the amount of the compound I,II or III in the organic solvent or water is adjusted to be as small as at most about 0.2 by weight and a thin coating is thereby formed, such a thin coating does not interfere with the soldering operation even if tne coating is formed on the soldering portion. Thus, depending upon the thickness of the coating, the coating may be formed on the entire surface of the electrical product, i.e. not only on the non soldering surface at the peripheral portion around the soldering portion, but also on the soldering portion. whereby the efficiency for the flux treatment may be improved. The formed coating brings about no adverse electrical effect, and may be retained as coated.However, it may readily be dissolve and removed with frons such as l,1,2 trichloro 1 2,2 trifluoroethane which give no adverse effect to the material of the electrical product. The coating of the compound I, II or III has a function whereby the flux deposited on the coating can readily be removed without using any solvent, in addition to the above mentioned function for preventing the penetration of the flux. Now, the present invention will be described with reference to Examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no means restricted by these specific Examples.EXAMPLES Each fluoro compound as identified in Table 1 was dissolved in l,l,2 trifluoro l,2,2 trichloroethane to obtain a 1 wt. solution. This solution was coated to the through holes of a printed circuit board and dried at room temperature to form a coating of the fluoro compound. A soldering flux was put in a container to a cepth of about 2 mm, and the printed circuit board was placed thereon so that the soldering surface side of the printed circuit board was located below and the parts mounting surface side was located above, and left for one minute. One minute later, the penetration of the flux via the through holes to the parts mounting surface side was determined by the observation with naked eyes.The results are shown in Table 1. Likewise, the above solution was coated to the base portion of a terminal extending outwardly from a switch, the base portion being in contact with the switch main body. The coated solution was dried at room temperature to form a coating of the fluoro compound. A soldering flux was coated to the forward end of the terminal to be soldered other than the base portion of the terminal on which the coating was formed. The penetration of the flux via the terminal to the interior of the switch was determined by the observation with naked eyes. The results are shown in Table 1.
