# Device for releasing and diffusing bubbles into liquid.

## Abstract
A device comprising a rotary shaft to be disposed in a liquid substantially vertically and rotatable about its own axis, the rotary shaft having a gas channel extending therethrough axially of the shaft, and a rotor 30 fixed to the lower end of the rotary shaft and having at its bottom surface a gas discharge outlet 31 communicating with the gas channel. The rotor is formed in its bottom surface with radial grooves 32 extending from the gas outlet to the peripheral surface of the rotor and each having an open end at the peripheral surface. A recess 33 is formed in the peripheral surface between the open ends of immediately adjacent grooves 32 and has an open lower end at the bottom surface. When the rotary shaft is rotated in a liquid while supplying a gas to the gas channel of the shaft, the gas flows out from the discharge outlet 31 into the radial grooves 32 and is released from the open ends of the grooves at the peripheral surface into the liquid in the form of finely divided bubbles. The bubbles are diffused through the entire body of the liquid by the liquid flowing in the centrifugal direction while revolving in the same direction as the rotor owing to the agitating action of the recesses 33 in the rotor peripheral surface.
