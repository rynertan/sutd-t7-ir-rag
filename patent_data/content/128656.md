# Engine control system.

## Abstract
The invention describes a control system in which open loops control the mixture strength and spark timing by means of look up tables 14, 12 stored in a computer and a closed loop 16, 18, 20, 24 with much greater response time corrects the air fuel ratio to compensate for long term drift in the open loops under the control of an ionisation sensor sensitive to the duration of the burn period. The ionisation sensor output is used only in operat ing ranges where its output accurately reflects the burn period duration. Consequently, the high speed response of an open loop is achieved at the same time as the long term stability of a feedback loop sensitive to the burn period duration.
