# Bi axial suspension arrangement of a component part in a projectile.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a bi axial support of a rotatable body 12 in a projectile for supporting said body such that it can perform small tilting motions about two mutually perpendicular axes lying in a plane, which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the projectile. The support consists of a spherical or partly spherical bearing body 24 introduced into a correspondingly spherical cup shaped recess 28 in a projectile fixed part 14 having the open end directed forwards in the motion direction of the projectile. The spherical bearing body 24 is retained in the recess 28 by means of two pairs of link arms 29, 30 and 31, 32 defining two virtual tilting axes A1, A2 for the bearing body 24 and connected to two output shafts 53, 54 such that a tilting motion of the body about the respective virtual axis A1 and A2 results in a rotation of the respective output shaft 53 and 54 and vice versa. When firing the projectile the spherical surface of the bearing body 24 comes in metallic contact with the spherical surface of the recess 28 , whereby the support can withstand very high acceleration forces in any direction.
