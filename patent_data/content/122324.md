## Description
POLYQUATERNARY AMMONIUM COMPOUNDS FOR USE IN COSMETIC FORMULATIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to scale inhibitors, flocculants and conditioning agents for skin and hair, and processes for their preparation and their use. The compounds of this invention are novel polyquaternary ammonium compounds. U.S. Patent No. 4,157,388 of Christiansen describes compositions containing polyquaternary ammonium compounds for use as hair conditioners and antistats and humectants for fibrous textile products. These compounds are generally liquid at room temperature. MirapolA 15 is a compound in accordance with Examples of Christiansen having the formula EMI1.1 wherein n is at least one. The present polyquaternary ammonium compounds were found to be easier to work with since they do not generally require a particular order of addition and can be added in the oil or water phase. The present compounds in general also are found to have a better water solubility than the prior art compounds of Christiansen. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The compounds of the present invention are conditioners and softeners having outstanding properties for use in hair and skin care compositions such as shampoos, soaps and lotions, and for use in scale inhibition and as flocculants. The present compounds are of the general Formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 may be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, CH2CH2OH, CH2CH OH CH3 and CH2CH2 OCH2CH2 OH wherein p is an integer from 0 to 6 with the proviso that not all of R1, R2, R3 and R4 are hydrogen x and y are the same or different and are an integer from 1 to 6 n is at least one, and ranges up to 100 or more m is an integer from 0 to 34 X is halogen Z is halogen or amino diamido ammonium residue and A is the residue of a dihalide. The quaternizing agents X A X are organic dihalides, preferably dichlorides, such as ClCH2CH2OCH2CH2Cl, ClCH2CH2 O CH2CH2 O CH2CH2Cl, ClCH2CH2Cl, BrCH2CH2Br, Cl CH2 6C1, ClCH2CH2CH2Cl and ClCH2CH OH CH2Cl. The polyquaternary compounds are prepared by condensation of a polyamine and a quaternizing agent as follows EMI2.2 The polyamine in turn is prepared by condensation of two diamino compounds with a dicarboxylic acid. The diamino compounds are of the formulaEMI2.3 andEMI2.4 and may be identical, wherein x is y and R1 and R2 are identical to R3 and R4. The polyquaternary ammonium compounds of the invention are generally present in amounts of from about 1 to 10 by weight based on the total cosmetic composition.Shampoos and liquid soaps generally contain about 1 to 10 by weight and lotions generally contain about 0.5 to 5 by weight. The cosmetic formulations comprise a suitable cosmetic carrier, the composition of which carrier depends on the purpose for which the final composition is intended.Thus, different carriers will be used dependent on whether the composition is to be used as a shampoo, a soap etc.These carriers are as described in the art. They may contain surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauryl ether sulfate, sodium lauryl sarcosinate, lauroamphocarboxyglycinate or co coamphocarboxyglycinate, solvents such as glycol and propylene glycol, proteins, citric acid, coloring agents, preservatives, fragrances, mineral oils, ttieners such as sodium chloride, PEG 6000 distearate, PEG 80 sorbitan laurate, cocamide DEA, lauramideDEA or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, vitamins, silicones, emollients such as lanolin, isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl myristate or petrolatum and viscosity builders such as carrageenan, carbomers or cocamidopropyl hydroxy sultaine.Where appropriate, CTFA designation is provided herein above and hereinafter. EXAMPLE IA. To a reaction flask was charged 438 grams 3 moles of adipic acid. After heating to about 550C., 612 grams 6 moles of dimethylamino propylamine was added in about five minutes. During this addition the temperature rose to 1010C. The reaction mixture.was heated to 165 1700C. in about 3 to 4 hours. Distillation started at about 1470C.After a temperature of 1650C. was reached, 62 grams of dimethylamino propylamine DMAPA was added over a half hour period. The reaction mixture was then heated to 180 to 1850C. in about two hours. After a temperature of 1800C. was reached, 62 grams of DMAPA was added in about a half hour and the temperature maintained at 180 185 C. for 1 2 hour. Vacuum was applied to remove water and excess DMAPA at a gradual increase to 5 lOmm. The vacuum of 5 10mm was maintained for an hour at 180 1850C. The reaction mixture was cooled to 1000C. and vacuum decreased to recover AdipicCondensate. The above reaction was repeated by replacing adipic acid 1 with equal molar amounts of azelaic acid and 2 with equal molar amounts of dimer acid HOOC CH2 34 COOH.B. To a two liter reaction flask was charged 282.73 grams 0.88 moles of Adipic Condensate formed underExample A above and 152.24 g water and the mixture was heated to 900C. Over four hours 122.28 g 0.855 moles dichloroethylether was added while a temperature of 90 1000C. was maintained. After the addition was completed, the reaction mass was heated to 1000C. and held for 5 hours at about 1000C. The reaction was found to be 99.7 completed by chloride ion analysis. 115.8 g Water was added to the amber colored material and the mixture heated to distill 51.4 g distillate to remove traces of unreacted dichloroethylether.The final product was a clear amber colored liquid. The pH of a 10 aqueous solution was 8.32. The solids content was 68.2 by Karl Fischer 31.8 water determination as described by the American Oil Chemistry Society . The com pound was found to have a value for n of about 115, determined from an intrinsic viscosity average molecular weight M of 52,500 and an M number average molecular w n weight of 45,800. EXAMPLE II The above reaction B was repeated by replacing the Adipic Condensate by the product of Example A using azelaic acid rather than adipic acid resulting in an azelaic acid derived product of the invention for use in Conditioning Shampoo C hereafter. EXAMPLE III The above reaction B was repeated by replacing dichloroethylether with 1, 6 dichloro hexane. EXAMPLE IV Also, azelaic acid derivative was prepared by reacting azelaic condensate with l,6 dichloro hexane.
