## Description
Flotation plant for stock recovering and liquid clarification, particularly for ppcr mill. efflucntsThe invention relates to flotation plants for stock recovering and liquid clarification. Particularly the invention relates to flotation plants for recovering fresh fibers and water clarification from paper mill effluents. More particu larly the present invention relates to flotation plants wherein in an annular tank containing the liquid to be treated operates a ro tatable pick up equipment. Such equipment is mounted on a column axial to the tank. The plant includes also means for delivering of recovered stock, means for deliv ering of clarified liquid, and means for delivering sed iment.A known plant of the aforesaid kind is disclosed e. g.in Italian Patent No. 704,314, filed 7th September 1963, by Milos Krofta Process and device for depurating nonclarified water waste particularly from paper and cellu lose mills .In such known plant the collcction of stock, which is caused to float by chemical flotation process, is provided by a rotatable equipment comprising substantially a radial arm provided with a scoop extending radially and formed in cross section as an Archimedean spiral. Such scoop is rotatable around its axis and is caused ro operate in the floating stock layer. Of course, the operation of such scoop subjected to a movent of rivolution around the tank axes and a movement of rotation around its axis is not even. In fact, during each tour of 360 only a rotation o f scoop of about 1200 is effective to collect the floating stock.The arrangement is suc that if the effective angle is increased the scoop soaks deeply and collectsalso the clarified liquid, whereas if the eftective angle is reuced the stock collection is scarce.Such scoop has, of course, the effect to rise the collected stock which is caused to drop inwardly for disposition.Such incomplete collection of floating stock involves long processing time, partial clarification Liquids and stock recovery.An object of the invention is to obviate the abovementioned disadvanteges. With this object in view tic presellt invention provides a plant as defined by the appended claims.According with tile arrangement provided by the present invention the rotatable equipment is provided with a radial blade to hring about a rise in tlie liquid whose upper stock floating layer is caused to drop inwardly.Bridging an annuiar space for rec ving the clarified liquid. Sucll arrangement involves that the central space is divided in two sections by two annular walls and that such walls are fastened and caused to rotate togeth er with the rotatable equipment. Such equipment provided with a blade, two annular walls, bridging drop means, comprises also radial feeding means which are connected by a rotatable coqXng tn a central hollow column which is fed. with liquid to be treated. With such arrangement the stock collection is a mere hy draulic continuous process which can be adjusted to op timum by adjusting the system variables to provide a rise at sill of stock dropping duct means equal to the thick ness of stock floating layer. According to a preferred embodiment oF the present inven tion the rotatable equipment may be provided with a bladed wheel adaptcd to engage the layer stock to help its col lection. The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diametral vertical cross section view of a plant according to the present invention.Figura 2 is a plan view o the plant of figure i.Figure 3 illustrates a cross section view, made on the lineIII III of figure 2,of the radial unit.Figure 4 is a detail of figure 1 in an enlarged scale.Referring now to the drawing, a plant for recovering the stock from effluents containing black liquors pulpmills comprises substantially an effluent circular tank 1 having a lip 10. Within tank 1 is provided a central circular coaxial pool which contains control means for driving the stock pick up rotation unit 3 as well s the system for collecting fresh fibers, the system for feed ing the effluent feed and system for collecting theclar ified water.The stock pick up rotating unit 3 comprises one or more tubes 30 for collecting the clarified water and at Least a fecding tube 31. I or driving the stock pick up rotating unit 3 the arrangement is as follow to a power source , s, t, are connected lines r , s , t , which lead to a manifold 32 which is connected with a motorgear 34. From motorgear 34 extends the driving end 3D of motogear shaft 34 on which gears 36 and 37 are provided.Gear 36 drives a chain 36, bending thereon , which, in turn, drives a gear 36 fast ended to the rotating member of the fiber pick up unit to be described hereafter. Gear 37 drives a chain J7 bending thereon which, in turn, drives a gear 37 fast ened to a shaft 137 extending radially from unit 3 i.e.from inner edge of tank 1. Shaft 137 is connected, with its end opposedto the end connected to gear 37 , to a shaft 137 extending radially therefrom, by means of reversing gear device 237. Preferably, the shafts are more than one e.g. three. . Fastened to the outer end of each shaft 137 and 137 there is a wheel 337 which engages the upper edge 10 of tank 1 and provides the rotation of unit 3.Through an inlet coaxial vertical line 38 the feeding flow is delivered to a line 31 through rota table coupling 32. From the bottom of tank 1 there is a radial pit 5, which is suitable to receive the decantation matters which precipitate in it, the collection being improved b rotating a doctor 50. Such de cantation sludge flows ontwardlay .g. trougha tube 51. The preceding description of the drawing is applicable even to known systems. In known systems the liquid surface is quite ev n and a spiral scoop skimmed the up per layer collecting and raising the floating fresh fibers providing the upper layer. the operation of such know spiral scoops is cyclic i.e. the collection of fi bers is perfect only in one point of each round of spi ral scoop. Hlsewhere the collection of fibers is either scarce or a quantity of water is collected together with fibers. As the fresli fibers are lifted by the spiral scoop upon the bath level no problem is involved by movement of unit 3 bridging the pool edge. According to the present invention at the upper layer of the bath level 6 a rise h is crcatcd.Suitably such rise h is as high as the thickncss of fresh fiber layer 4 so that said fresh fibers 4 may be collected by gravity at a low er level i.e. in pool 2. The scalding is obtained by providing unit 3 with sealing members 60 which cooperates with a resilicnt scaling member, the coupling providing a safe seal. Provision of rise h is brought about by a radial barri r 7 which affect the whole height of the bath. Vice versa it may be said that the liquid level in tank 1 is maintained at the same level as the upper wedge 70 of barrier 7.CLose thereafter considering the dir c t ion o E rotation of unit 3 which is, with reference to figure 7 anti clock wise, there is a duct 31 parallel to the upper edge 70.The upper edge of duct 31 is coplanar to edge 70.Thereafter, considering the direction of rotation of unit 3, there is a trough 71 which too extends radially and is provided with bottom wall sloping down towards the central pool 2. Its outer wall extends upwardly to provide an apron 72 to be described hereafter. From the base 73 of barrier 7 extending in a direction contrary to the rotation direction of same there is a bottom wall 74 with an eu e 75 which provides in cooperation with the trough 71 a siphon like way lor the feed flow.In fact duct 31 is provided with outlet opening extending downwardly, consequent Iv tlie feeding flow passing there trough follow the way indicated by the arrows at 76. As can be seen from figure 3 the feed flow follows there after an horizontal way contrary to the direction of rotation of unit 3. The feel fraction coping with bar rier 7 is controlled by controlling the rotation speed Of same. Its volume is knept so as to exceed the vol ume of the inlet feed 76 less the volume of the outlet flow discharging through tubes 30. ore particularly such excecding volume is kept constantly equal to the volume of fresh fibers collected at 71. Consequently, the inlet and outlet volumes are in balance and the driv ing energy of the barrier brings about a wave 4 i.e.a rise of fibers in front of iber collecting trough 71.According to a prefereed embodiment of the present invention to provide an easy collection of fresh fibers, which being picked up according to this inventioii water free are rather compact and sticky, a collecting wheel 8 is provided which is driven b y c h a i n 36 . As such collecting wheel is a member of unit 3 in operation is subjected to a movement of revolution and to a movement of rotation. Collecting wheel 8 comprises a tube 80 having a plurality of spokes 81, e.g. six. On each spoke 81 is adjustably mounted a blade 82. The arrange ment is such that the distance betwen the wheel axis may be adjusted so as to regulate the effect of each blade in operation.For adjusting the process variables two ways are available 1 controlling the speed of revolution of pick up unit 5 and correlatively the inlet and outlet flow of the liquids involved 2 adjusting the blades 82 and particularly the rim level of barrier rel ative to the liquid surface 6. Of course, the wheel 8 with its blades 82 improves the collection of fresh fi bers urging them into duct 71 to be ducted to the pool 2. From pool 2 they can be removed through tube 83. As described previously the outlet of clarified 1 squid take place through outlet holes 31 provided in tubes 30, and flowing therethrough reaches the pool 2 and more par ticularly an annular space 21 thereof which is hy draulically sealed off both from the inner space 22 and from the tank bath IL In fact, the inner and outer walls providing the annular space 21, are arranged at the bottom with sealing coupling 60 61 of the kind shown at figure 4.Operation of plant is as follow initially tank 1 is empty and the pick up unit is steady.. The liquid to be treated is ed through tube 38. It flows through manifold 31 and openings 31 . As soon as the liquid in the tank 1 has reached a quote close to level 6, the pick up unit is started and valves not shown are opended to provide a way for the clarified water from tlie bottom layers of the bath to reach the annular pool 21 and to leave the plant through li ines 9L and 92. By combined effect of inlet of feeding of e ffluent liquid, and of outlet clarified liquids as ctl as by roLation of barrier 7, a dinamic balance is established which brings about arise of layer h of fresh fibers before the wheel 8 and a counter current movement of flow 76. The arrangement is such that when unit 5 is revolved also the wheel 8 and the latter i.e. its blades urge the fresh fibers into duct 71 through which they reach the cen tral section 22 of pool 2 to be ducted cutwardly through tube 83 . On the taiik bottom precipitate the heaviest matters which provide a sludge which is collected by doctor 50 and urged into pit S to which is connected on indefinitely. For necessary adjustments it is advisable to control the inlet and outlet flows instead of ad just ing mechanical members which are difficult to reg ulate.
