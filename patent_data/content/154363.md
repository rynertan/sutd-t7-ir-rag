# Process for separating linear chain oxo alcohols from mixtures of linear and branched chain oxo alcohols.

## Abstract
A mixture of linear and branched chain detergent oxo alcohols, containing from 11 to 16 carbon atoms in the molecule, is dissolved in a hydrocarbon or ether solvent, and the solution thus obtained is cooled to obtain a dispersion of a solid phase in a liquid phase. Said solid phase constituted by the linear chain oxo alcohol fraction is separated and recovered. The branched chain oxo alcohol fraction is sepa rated and recovered from the liquid phase.
