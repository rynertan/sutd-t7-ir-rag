# Plasmids containing lambda Pl promoter, and engineered restriction site for convenient replacement of ribosomal binding site, hosts containing the plasmids and related methods.

## Abstract
An improved vector which upon introduction into a suit able host containing the thermolabile repressor C Vectors of the invention may also include a T₁T₂ rRNA transcription termination sequence located 3 of the second restriction enzyme site. The inventive vectors may have ori gin of replications capable of autonomous production in the host of at least 400 constitutive copies. Plasmids have been constructed from the vectors and used to produce bovine, chicken, porcine and human growth hormones, human apo lipoprotein E and human superoxide dismutase and ana loges thereof in host cells. Such superoxide dismutase or analogs thereof may be used to catalyze the reduction of superoxide radicals, re duce reperfusion injury, prolong the survival time of isolat ed organs and prevent neurological injury. Enzymatically active eucaryotic superoxide dismutase or an analog thereof may also be produced by an improved method of this invention which employs a production medi um having a concentration of Cu greater than about about 2 ppm. The invention also concerns improved methods of re covering purified enzymatically active eucaryotic super oxide dismutase or analogs thereof.
