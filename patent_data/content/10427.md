# Transformer cores.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing transformer cores of either the continuously wound or cut wound type using electrical steel strip having approximately a linear taper. By selecting a suitable taper, a hexagonal or higher order approximation of a circular cross section for the legs of the cores is available. Two complementary core strips can be cut from a single rectangular stock strip in a scrapless manner.
