# Theophylline derivatives, antibodies and their preparation from theophylline immunogens, as well as an immuno assay method and reagent means for determining theophylline.

## Abstract
Theophylline immunogens, antibodies prepared there from, labeled theophylline conjugates, synthetic intermedi ates, and the use of such antibodies and labeled conjugates immonoassays for determining theophylline are dis closed. The immunogens comprise theophylline coupled at its 9 position to an immunogenic carrier material. Likewise, the labeled conjugates and synthetic intermediates are 9 position derivatives of theophylline or synthetic precursors thereof. The antibody and labeled reacents are particularly useful in homogeneous nonradioisotopic immunoassays for measuring theophylline in biological fluids such as serum.
