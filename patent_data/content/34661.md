# Method and apparatus for recovering charged ions from solution.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for removing charged ions from solution by treating the solution with electrodialysis followed by Donnan dialysis. One of many applications is for treating the baths associated with the metal finishing, e.g. plating, anodizing, or etching, industry. For example, charged ions can be removed from the rinse baths of a plating line by treating the rinse water of a first rinse bath 12 following the plating bath 10 with an electrodialysis unit 16 and returning the concentrated solution to the plating bath 10 , and treating a second rinse bath 14 following the first rinse bath 12 with a Donnan dialysis unit 20 to produce an additional concen trated solution and a diluted effluent which may be either discharged into a sewer or stream, or readily destroyed.
