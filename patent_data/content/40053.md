## Description
MAGNETIC TREATMENT APPARATUS The present invention relates in general to a magnetic medical treatment apparatus. More particularly, it relates to an improved apparatus for magnetic treatment to relieve pain and cure disease, also called magnetic acupuncturing It has been widely recognized that magnetism is effective to relieve a stiff neck and to cure other body troubles and malfunctions such as hypertension. Thus, a variety of adhesive plasters and other forms of magnetic curing aids and devices have been produced, and been used by individuals. On the effect of curing by magnetism, the theory widely accepted is that an electric current caused in a flow of blood under a magnetic field gives rise to a stimulus or impetus to an autonomic nervous system, thereby normalizing its functions in an individual. Magnetic acupuncturing or treatment devices which have hitherto been proposed in the art make common use of a fixed permanent magnet or electromagnet i.e. energized by a direct current so that a static magnetic field may be provided and applied to a body surface, in particular to an affected zone thereon or to one or more of what are called tsubo or key points which have been well established according to theChinese or oriental medicine to be distributed over the surface of a human body. The present invention seeks to provide a a new and useful magnetic medical treatment apparatus which is relatively simple and inexpensive and yet capable of achieving increased curing effects b a compact magnetic medical treatment device which can be used adjustably for a variety of curing purposes and c a versatile magnetic medical treatment apparatus which can be used adjustably by a practitioner for a patient or by and for different individuals for a variety of curing purposes. Other objectives will become apparent as the following description proceeds. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a magnetic medical treatment apparatus comprising at least one magnet, i.e. a permanent magnet or electromagnet, for producing a static magnetic field in the proximity thereof support means manually operable for positioning the at least one magnet in a predetermined proximity relationship with a preselected zone e.g. an affected portion or a tsubo or key point on the body surface of an individual and cyclic drive means for cyclically displacing the at least one magnet to cause the magnetic field to be dynamically fluctuated in the region of the said preselected zone on the body surface. These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following description of certain embodiments thereof as taken with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 is an elevational view essentially in section, diagrammatically illustrating a magnetic medical treatment apparatus embodying the present invention using a rotating magnet FIG. 2 is an elevational view, essentially in section, diagrammatically illustrating another embodiment of the invention in which a magnet is electromagnetically vibrated FIG. 3 is an elevational sectional view, partly schematic, diagrammatically illustrating a modification of the embodiment of FIG. 3 FIGS. a , 4 b , 4 c and 4 d are elevational views diagrammatically illustrating different embodiments of the vibrating magnetic stylus member which may be used with the apparatus of FIG. 3 FIG. 5 is an elevational, sectional and schematic view diagrammatically illustrating another vibrator arrangement embodying the present invention FIG. 6 is a sectional and schematic view diagrammatically illustrating a massaging apparatus incorporating a vibrating magnet member for constituting an embodiment of the invention FIG. 7 is a schematic view, in section, diagrammatically illustrating a portion of the apparatus of FIG. 6 FIGS. 8 A and 8 B are elevational views diagrammatically illustrating different magnetic stylus members which may be used in the apparatus of FIG. 6 FIG. 9 is an elevational sectional view diagrammatically illustrating a further embodiment of the invention having a rotary disc carrying a plurality of permanent magnets detachably and replaceably secured thereon FIG. 10 is a sectional diagrammatic view taken along the line X X in FIG. 9 FIG. 11 is an elevational view, essentially in section, diagrammatically illustrating a rotary arrangement which carries a plurality of permanent magnets on a rotating disc, the magnets being also individually rotatable on their own axes FIG. 12 is a plan view essentially in section taken along the line XII XII in FIG. 11 FIG. 13 is an elevational view, partly in section and partly schematic, diagrammatically illustrating a further rotary apparatus embodying the present invention and FIG. 14 is a plan view essentially in section taken along the line XIV XIV in FIG. 13. Referring first to FIG. 1, a magnetic medical treatment device shown includes a plastic casing 1 in the form of a cylindrical cup and having a projection la for engagement with a preselected zone , e.g. an affected area, or a preselected tsubo or key point, on the body surface of a patient. In the casing 1, a rotary shaft 2 having a permanent magnet member 3 securely mounted thereon is journalled in a bearing 4 fitted immediately above the projection la. The permanent magnet member 3 is formed with a pair of legs 3a and 3b whose ends are positioned symmetrically about the shaft 2 and serve as N and S poles, respectively, as shown, or with two or more such pairs arranged in the form of spider legs.The two or more say, six poled magnetic legs or projections 3a and 3b set up a magnetic field of desired strength e.g. 300 to 10000 Gauss in the region of the zone on the body surface in engagement with the projection la. The shaft 2 carries a wheel 5 secured. thereon which is in pressure engagement with a rubber wheel 6 securely carried on a drive shaft 7 of an electric motor 8 of miniature type. The latter has input leads 9 energized by a commercial AC supply, or a battery not shown which may be accommodated in the casing 1. The motor 8 is fitted in a plastic support 10 secured to an inner wall portion of the casing 1. The latter is threadedly fitted with a plastic or rubber cap 11. In manipulation, the casing 1 is manually supported to bring the projection la into engagement with an affected zone, or a preselected tsubo or key point on the body surface of an individual to press the zone or point under an appropriate pressure and the motor 8 may be energized to rotate the drive shaft 7. The rotation is transmitted via the wheels 6 and 5 to the shaft 2 to rotate the permanent magnet member 3, This causes the magnetic field setup in the body surface by the poles 3a and 3b to be dynamically fluctuated i.e. by relative movement of the poles and casing . The result is that the zone or point is placed under the synergistic actions by the pressure stimulus and the dynamic field fluctuation of the device to yield an enhanced curing effect. The device of FIG, 1 is shown further including means to achieve the rotation of the shaft 2 with other than the motor ss. The shaft 2 is thus drivably coupled with a unidirectional clutch 12 fitted in the support 10 and having a shaft 13 rotatably received in a bearing 14.The shaft 13 is secured to a bevel gear 15 in mesh with a bevel gear 16 securely carried on a shaft 17. A spur gear 18 is also securely carried on the shaft 17 and in mesh with a gear section 19a of a swingable lever 19 which is pivoted on a shaft 20. A fixed lever 21 has a pair of arms 21a carrying the shaft 20, and is fixed to an inner wall portion of the casing 1 with rivets 22 and 23. The swingable lever 19 has a lever section 19b biassed away from the lever portion 21b of the fixed lever 21 by a spring 24, which urges the lever 19 about the shaft 20 in the clockwise direction. In manipulation, the lever portions 19b and 21b of the swingable and fixed levers 19 and 21 are gripped so as to be brought together against the spring pressure.This causes a rotation of the gear section 19a of the lever 19 about the shaft 20 in the counterclockwise direction. The rotation is transmitted via the spur gear 18, shaft 17, bevel gears 16 and 15 to the drive shaft 13 and, in turn, to the drive shaft 2 via the clutch 12 to rotate the magnet member 3. The lever 19 may then be released to allow its gear section 19a to rotate in the clockwise direction under the spring pressure and, in turn, to cause the spur gear 18, shaft 17 and bevel gears 16 and 15 to rotate back to their respective original angular positions. Since the unidirectional clutch 12 is at this time incapable of coupling the shaft 13 to the shaft 2, this reversed rotation is not transmitted to the shaft 2 and the magnet member 3 simply keeps rotating by virtue of its inertia.Additional rotary impulses may be applied to the magnet member 3 by repetitively gripping the levers 19b and 21b. The device of FIG. 2 makes use of a casing 101 which is formed, as in the embodiment of FIG. 1, with a projection 101a for pressure engagement with a preselected surface zone of the body surface df a patient. In the casing lpl, a coil 125 is seated to surround a permanent magnet member 103 poled as shown or with an opposite polarity to set up a magnetic field to place that zone thereunder, and has its central flange 103c supported with a helical spring 126 so as to be capable of movement up and down as shown. A lid 127 is threadedly fitted into the upper inner walL of the casing 101 to hold the spring 126 and the coil 125 in position.A cap 128 which is adequately shaped for gripping convenience is threadedly fitted with the upper outer wall of the casing 101. The coil 125 is energized by a cyclic current source, e.g. a commercialAC supply or the output current of an oscillator such as a multivibrator, to electromagnetically vibrate the permanent magnet member 103. This causes the magnetic field set up by the magnet 103 and affecting said zone of the body surface to be dynamically fluctuated to give rise to an enhanced curing effect basically in the manner previously described. The frequency of the vibration should typically range between 2 and 300 Hz. The strength peak of the magnetic field here again should generally range between 300 and 10000 Gauss. In the device of FIG. 3, an elongated permanent magnet body 203 having N and S poles at its opposite ends 203a and. 203b is here again formed with its central flange 203c supported by a helical spring 226 in a casing 201 so that the body 203 may be moved up and down in vibration, The casing 201 is formed with central openings 230a and 230b at its lower and upper ends through which the ends of the body 203 shaped generally in the form of a stylus protrude respectively. In this embodiment, the lower end 203a of the body 203 or stylus is designed to be brought directly into a pressure engagement with a preselected surface zone 231a, i.e. an affected area, or tsubo or key point, on the body surface of a patient designated at 231. Seated in tandem within the casing 201 is a pair of coils 225a and 225b which surround the magnet body 203 above and below its central flange 203c, respectively. A vibration power supply 232 for energizing the coils 225a and 225b comprises an oscillator unit 233 which provides a periodic signal of alternating polarity across its output terminals 233a and 233b. This periodic signal may, as indicated, comprise a succession of alternating rectangular pulses in which positive rectangular half cycles occur alternately with negative rectangular half cycles. These positive and negative half cycles which develop at the output terminals 233a and 233b are applied to the coils 225a and 225b, respectively, via conductors 234a and conductors 234b. To enable this, diodes 235b and 235a are connected across the conductors 234a and 234b, respectively, so as to conduct the positive half cycles and the negative half cycles, respectively and to block the negative half cycles and the positive half cycles, respectively.The result is a vibration of the magnet body 203 which sets up a magnetic field precisely traversing the preselected zone 231a on the patient s body surface 231. The magnetic field is thus dynamically fluctuated in its intensity to give rise to an enhanced curing effect for the patient. An adjustably variable resistor 236 is provided in the power circuit 232 as shown to set the amplitude of the vibration imparted to the magnet body 203 at a desired value. The oscillator 233 is capable of frequency adjustment to establish the frequency of this vibration at an appropriate value, i.e.in the range between 2 and 100 Hz. In this manner, the stylus tip 203a may repetitively make and break contact with the desired point 231a on the body surface 231.Depending upon the stroke or amplitude of this vibration, the external manipulation pressure applied by the casing 201 and exerted on the stylus member 203 via the spring 226 may be adjusted to keep the stylus tip 203a being vibrated in contact with the desired point 231a on the body surface 231. Thus, the vibration of the magnet body 203 also brings about an intermittent pressurization and produces consequential recurrent stimulus or impetus on the point 231a on the body surface 231. The production of such stimulus or impetus may be achieved in a desired fashion by using one of a variety of different stylus members e.g.those with different tip forms as shown in FIGS.4 a , 4 b , 4 c and 4 d . Stylus members 2Q3 shown in FIGS. 4 a and 4 b make use of a permanent magnet material whereas those shown in FIGS. 4 c and 4 d make use of a non permanent magnet material.Stylus members 203 of FIGS. 4 a and 4 c have tips 203a and 203b shaped to possess a single round projection.Stylus members 203 of FIGS. 4 b and 4 d have tips 203a and 203b shaped to possess three round projections. The embodiments of FIGS. 2 and 3 are, therefore, designed to apply to an affected part or key point a fluctuating magnetic field and flux while subjecting that part or point to a vibratory stimulus or impetus. In this manner, an intensified stimulating current induction is produced in the blood flow to achieve an enhanced effect of functional recovery and treatment for the patient or individual. FIG. 5 shows a modification of the embodiment ofFIG. 3 wherein a stylus member 303 formed of a permanent magnet carries an electromechanical transducer 340 energized by a power supply 341 and accommodated in a casing 301. The vibration stimulating tip portion 303a of the stylus member 303 is shown in engagement with a preselected surface zone 331a of the body surface 331 which is slightly deformed thereby under the engagement pressure. A further modification shown in FIG. 6 of the vibratory system comprises a fixed core member 450 con stituted by laminated E shaped silicon steel plates and having a coil 451 wound thereon. The coil 451 is energized by a commercial AC fed through leads 452 to produce magnetic fluxes through the fixed core member 450. A movable iron plate 453 is carried by an L shaped member 454 whose one end is attached to one end of the fixed core member 450 by means of screws 455 so that the plate 453 is spacedly juxtaposed with the core member 450, and with the coil 451 energized, the member 454 is vibrated.The member 454 terminates with a chuck 456 on which a shank 457, 457 carrying a permanent magnet body 403,403 is detachably mounted. As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the chuck 456 comprises a U shaped clamping element 456a having a space 456b into which the mounting end 457a, 457 a of the shank 457, 457 is inserted. This end includes a key element 457b,4571b adapted to mate with a positioning depression 456c in the space 456b. A bolt 457d, is inserted through openings not shown in the clamping element 456a and through an opening 457c, 457 c formed in the mounting end 457a, 457 a of the shank 457, 457 and a butterfly nut 456e is then threaded with the bolt 456d to firmly secure the shank 457, 457 supporting the body 403, 403 to the vibra tile member 454. The stylus member 403, 403 which as shown in FIG. 8 A , 8 B is formed with a desired shape along its tip area adapted to contact with the body surface. The stylus member 403 shown in FIG. 8 A is preferred to exert a rubbing or kneading effect on the body surface whereas the stylus member 403 shown in FIG. 8 B is preferred to exert a tapping or stroking effect on the body surface. The shank 457 of FIG. 8 A should be secured via the chuck 456 to the vibratile member 454 to extend generally coaxial therewith so as to be vibrated i.e.swingingly vibrated as indicated by arrows 458. The shank 457 of FIG. 8 B should be secured via the chuck 456 to the vibratile member 454 to extend generally perpendicular thereto so as to be vibrated i.e. reciprocatingly vibrated as indicated by arrows 458 . The vibrating unit, 450, 451, 453, 454 is shown accommodated in a casing 459 provided with a manual switch 460 for switching on and off the energization of the coil 451 in the vibrator . The stylus member 403, 403 may be contained in a housing 401, 401 so that its end portion is projected therefrom for engagement with a preselected surface zone of the body surface of a patient or individual as has been described. FIGS. 9 and 10 show another form of the apparatus embodying the invention in which the dynamically fluctuated magnetic field is applied to a preselected zone on the body surface of a patient or individual. The apparatus makes use of a rotary disc 561 which carries a plurality of permanent magnets 503a, 503b, 503c, 503d, 503e and 503f. The disc 561 is secured on a shaft 502 by means of nuts 562 and has a plurality of openings 563a, 563b, 563c, 563d, 563e and 563f into which the magnets 503a, 503b, 503c, 503d, 503e and 503f are inserted and detachably fixed individually by means of a spring projection 564 formed on a wall portion of each opening. The shaft 502 is journalled in a bearing 504 fitted in a support disc 510 secured to the inner wall of a casing 501 and has a gear 565 in mesh with a gear 566 rotatable by an electric motor 508 of miniature type mounted on the support disc 510. The motor 508 is energized by batteries 567a and 567b securely seated on the floor of the casing 501 via a drive control circuit unit 568 including a driver circuit for the motor and switches also securely seated on the floor of the casing 501. A cap 511 is threadedly fitted with the casing 501 to seal the foregoing components of the apparatus therein. The permanent magnets 503a through 503f are shown arranged on the rotary disc 561 radially symmetrically about the shaft 502 and are revolved immediately below the cap 511 as the motor 508 is driven to rotate the drive shaft 502. The casing 501 may be manually carried to bring a preselected zone of the body surface of an individual in contact with the cap 511 in a region thereof below which the magnets 502a through 503f pass as they are revolved. In the example shown, the magnets 503a, 503b and 503c are positioned to direct their N poles upwards and the magnets 503d, 503e and 503f are positioned to direct their S poles upwards.As the disc 561 rotates, the preselected surface zone is consequently placed under a magnetic field whose polarity is successively switched in the sequence of N N N S S S N N N ... and hence under a predetermined format of the dynamically fluctuated magnetic field. As a result of the fact that the field fluctuates both in its strength and polarity, the current electromag neticÅally induced in the blood flow fluctuates both in its magnitude and direction in a given format. An optimum format can therefore be chosen to give rise to an optimum curing effect. The rate of switching of the magnetic field can be altered as desired by acting on the drive control circuit unit 568 for the motor 508. It has generally been found that successive magnetic fields should occur at a rate of 1 to 100 Hz.Accordingly, in the example shown, i.e. with six magnets 503a through 503f mounted on the disc 561, the disc 561 should rotate at 1 6 to 20 rpm. A desired polarity sequence of the dynamically fluctuated magnetic field can be set up by arranging the magnets 503a through 503f to direct their poles in a format corresponding to the desired sequence. For example, formats of N N N N N N , N S N S N S ...,. and N NS S N N S ..... and practically any other format of polarity switching sequence can be achieved. In each case, each pole gradually approaches the selected zone and then goes away. Consequently, the strength of the magnetic field periodically varies in a pulsating form. It has been found that such form of variation in the field strength gives rise to a markedly better curing effect than the use of a fixed constant field strength Each of the magnets 503a to 503f should have a magnetic strength in the range, say, between 300 and 3000 Oersteds. In a modified embodiment shown in FIGS. 11 and 12 of the rotary system, in which same references are used to designate same components as in FIGS. 9 and 10, the rotary disc 561 has a plurality of stands 670a, 670b, 670e and 670d securely mounted thereon which have their respective shafts 671a, 671b, 671c and 671d driven by pulse motors 672a, 672b, 672c and 672d, respectively. The shafts 671a, 671b, 671c and 671d have permanent magnets 603a, 603b, 603c and 603d securely carried thereon, respectively at their respective centers. The pulse motors 672a through 672d are mounted on the rotary disc 561 and driven by a driver circuit not shown constructed in a unit mounted, for example, to depend from the rotary disc 561. The driver circuit is used to incrementally rotate the respective pulse motors 672a through 672d individually to rotate and position the magnets 603a, 603b, 603c and 603d to make them individually establish their magnetic fields of desired polarities. It is also possible to constitute the motors 672a, 672b, 672c and 672d each with a DC motor and to keep them also rotating constantly as the supporting disc 561 is rotated in operation of the apparatus.Then, by permitting the DC motors to rotate at different speeds and the latter to be adjustably varied it is possible to enable a choice among quite a diverse range of possibilities of the field polarity sequence and strength variation in operation of the apparatus. In a further modification shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, in which same references are used to designate same components as in the embodiment of FIGS. 9 and 10 and the embodiment of FIGS. 11 and 12, the stands 670a, 670b, 670c and 670d for rotatably carrying the magnets 603a, 603b, 603c and 603d on their respective shafts 671a, 671b, 671c and 671d have leaf springs 673a, 673b, 673c and 673d secured thereto, respectively, to urge wheels 674a, 674b, 674c and 674d, each in the fort of a circular truncated cone secured to the shaft 671a, 671b, 671c, 671d, to mate with a wheel 675, also in the form of a circular truncated cone but of a larger size secured to the cap 511 of the apparatus. The mating surfaces of the wheels 674a through 674d are composed of a high friction coefficient material such as rubber. The mating surface of the wheel 675 should be formed with a fine rugged formation e.g. knurled to increase the friction with the wheels 674a through 674d. As the rotary disc 561 is rotated in the direction of the arrow, the wheels 674a, 674b, 674c and 674d are thus also rotated to rotate the magnets 603a, 603b, 603c and 603d supported respectively on their shafts 671a, 671b, 671c and 671d in the direction indicated by the respective arrows.
