# A surgical appliance for forming an opening through the skin.

## Abstract
A surgical appliance for forming an opening through the skin of a patient takes the form of a trocar 10 which can be expanded by inserting an expander 12 through the proxim al end and moving it towards the distal end. In one aspect of the invention, the trocar is a tube partially divided by cut away openings in the tube, into two component portions which are preloaded into a closed condition in which they converge towards the distal end, so that the expansion is against the preloading. In a second aspect, the trocar has two or more components and one or more cutting edges at the distal end which extend across substantially the full width of the distal end and the arrangement provides that the cross section of the trocar does not increase towards the distal end in the open condition. Taken together, the features of the second aspect minimise the danger of tearing the skin.
