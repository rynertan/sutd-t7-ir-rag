# Hydroxyimino substituted aminoacetonitrile intermediates and their preparation.

## Abstract
This invention relates to novel hydroxyimino substituted aminoacetonitriles, which are intermediates in the preparation of substituted 2 aminopyrazines, which latter compounds are intermediates in the preparation of insecticidal benzoylpyrazinylureas. The hydroxyimino substituted aminoacetonitriles are of the formula CHEM wherein R 1 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl R 2 is hydrogen, halo, C1 C3 alkyl, or trifluoromethyl n is 0,1 or 2, with the proviso that when n 2, only one ortho position may be substituted and R 3 is C1 C4 alkyl. These compounds are prepared by reacting an aminoacetonitrile with the appropriate alpha chloro or alpha bromo oxime.
