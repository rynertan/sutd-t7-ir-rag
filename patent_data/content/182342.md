# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PARTICLE BLASTING USING PARTICLES OF A MATERIAL THAT CHANGES ITS STATE

## Abstract
In particle blasting, particles are used that change state, at least before the particle blasting, which is carried out similarly to sand blasting. An example of such material is ice. The novelty is primarily that the particles are cast or fro zen in mould chambers. This makes it possible to give the particles any desired shape, for instance with many sharp edges and or sharp corners, and in this way their process ing effect is improved. The particles may be made by casting or freezing in an apparatus provided with a rotatable drum 9 in the outer surface of which open mould chambers 12 are formed, which chambers can be closed by the inner surface 8 of a freezing cylinder 6 , the freezing zone 19 of which can be cooled by means of a cooling chamber 13 provided with a cooling medium through supply and discharge tubes 14 and 15 resp. . The cast particles are released from the drum 9 , the outer jacket 11 of which may consist of an elastic material of rubber for facilitating the moulding, and then fall down into a discharge chamber 7 , from where they are sucked into a particle blasting pistol not shown , through a particle discharge tube 18 . In the pistol, the ice particles are mixed for instance with water at high pressure, which by an ejector effect creates the necessary low pressure for suction, and which ejects the ice particles against the sur face to be treated.
