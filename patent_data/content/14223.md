## Description
Composition and method for influencing plant growthThe present invention concerns a further development of t invention described in DE Offenlegungsschrift 2 657 728 and Belgium patent 849 723 and also filed in many otherEuropean and oversea countries, claiming the Swiss priority date of December 23, 1975, and the present invention provides compositions for regulating, in particular for inhibiting plant growth which contain as active components quaternary salts of pyrrolidiniur acetic acid anilides and a method of regulating plant growth which comprises the use of these active compounds and compositions which contain them. The invention also provides novel quaternary salts of pyrrolidinium acetic acid anilides and a process for their manufacture.A substantial number of quaternary aminoacetic anilides and pyridinioacetic anilides which possess pharmaceutical, disinfectant and bactericidal fungicizal action etc.are known from the literature, but no particulars are provided relating to any positive and inhibiting action of these compounds with regard to plant growth. From the extensive literature, attention is drawn here only to a number of references,such as Nature 216, 1331 33 1967 , 223, 748 1969 Europ. J. Pharmacology 13, 46 1970 DOS 2 351 942 British patent specification 688 604 Journ. hterocycl. Chem., 8, 1079 1971 Gazz. Chim. Ital.95, 1237 1965 Tetrahedron letters 1969, 4945 etc.Certain quaternary aminoacetic anilides have already been suggested for different technical purposes, for example as moth repellents US patent specification 2 343 071 and German Reichspatent 905 373 etc. .None of these publications contains the remotest allusion to or indication of a plant growth influencing action of such known compounds. On the other hand, quaternary ammonium compounds having another structure are on the market as plant regulators and are described in detail for example in R. Wegler s Chemie der Pflanzenschutz und Schädlingsbekämpfungs mittel , vol. 2, Springer Verlag, 1970, pp. 323 326 and 407, with reference to the original literature.Further quaternary ammonium compounds with a plant growth regulating action have become known for example from Ann.Appl. Biol. 63, 211 1969 from US patent specification 3 701 799, 3 580 716, 3 856 850 and 3 895 933, and from the Journ.Agr. and Food Chem. 7, 264 1959 and 16, 523 1968 .However, all these prior at growth regulators are not quaternary ammonioalkanoic acid anilides, but are to some extent very complicated organic compoundsThe present invention is base on the surprising observation that quaternary salts of pyrrolidinium acetic acid anilides of the formula I whereinEMI3.1 X represents the anion of any non phytotoxic acid HX, possess outstanding plant growth regulating properties in mono and especially dicotyledonous plants, and can be used for example as growth inhibitors for grasses, cereals, soya beans, ornamentals, fruit etc., and also have some abscission effect on fruit and leaves.The anion X can be selected from any of the nonphytotoxic acids and has no appreciable influence on the biological action. X is for instance chlorine, bromine or iodine.According to the present invention, the novel salts of the formula I are obtained by methods which are known per se by reacting 3 chloro aniline with a reactive halogenacetic acid derivative to give a halogenoacetic acid anilide of the formulaEMI4.1 and then reacting this compound with pyrrolidine and converting the resultant pyrrolidino acetic acid anilide with a quatermsing agent introducing the allyl group besides a non phytotoxic anion. The intermediates of the formula II are obtained by treating 3 chloro aniline with halogen substituted acetic acid or suitable derivatives, such as the esters,halides, amides or anhydrides thereof, the prefered derivative is chloroacetylchloride.The reaction of the halogen substituted aceticacid anilides of the formula II with pyrrolidine is carried out by known methods to form by dehydrohalogenation the corresponding acetic acid anilide.The subsequent aftertreatment with the quaternising agent provides quaternary substitution of the nitrogen atom.This quaternisation is customarily performed with a mineral acid ester of allyl alcohol such as an allyl halide or diallyl sulphate. Allyl chloride and allyl bromide are tre preferred quaternising agents.The quaternary salts of the formula I possess the plant growth regulating action, in particular a plant growthretarding action. Accorcing y, compounds of the formula I can be use for controlling the growth of plants in agriculture and in horticulture. A variety of typical methods of application is listed hereinafter For reducing the labour and expense involved in cutting by inhibiting the herbaceous soil covering on road shoulders, canal embankments, in airports, fruit plantations, on turf for sporting activities and ornamental grass plots etc., and for inhibiting the growth of shoots of bushes, hedges, ornamental bushes, fruit and other trees. For inhibiting unwanted suckers in tobacco plants and other cultures. For increasing the yield in cultures of leguminosae for example soya and ground nuts by inhibiting the vegetative growth in favour of the generative growth. For increasing the stability of crops of plants which are susceptible to lodging, such as cereals, maize and soya preventing the plants from being flattened under unfavourable weather conditions . For inhibiting the excessive growth of ornamentals which are reared in pots, such as chrysanthemums, poinsettia, etc. For increasing the blossoming of cultivated plants, for example young fruit trees. For speeding up the ripening of fruit. For facilitating the harvesting of fruit by promoting the formation of separation tissue betweenthe fruit and the shoots of the plants.The quaternary ammonium salts of the formula I are used in the form or preparation which, in addition to containing the quaternary ammonium salt of the formula I , also contain a carrier or a surface active agent or a carrier and a surface active agent. The effectiveness of the quaternary ammonium salts of the formula I depends on the concentration when they are used as plant growthregulators. In addition, substantial variations with regard to the active concentration of the quaternary ammonium salts of the formula I as plant growthregulators are possible, this concentration being dependent not only on the species, organism or nature of the plants to be treated, but also on the physiological age of the plants. The cocentration to be applied should therefore be selected depending on the composition employed, the species of plant, and the duration of the application.In general, effective concentraions are in the range between 1 and 5000 ppm and preferably between 10 and 500 ppm. However, these values are of no particular importance.The active compounds of the formula I can be used by themselves or in combination with other regulators, with trace elements, chelates, fertilisers, and also with fungicides, insecticides and acaricides. Furthermore, stabilisers can also be added to the active compounds and the compositions which contain them.The following Example illustrates the manufacture of an active salt of formula I.Example 255,2 g 2 moles 3 chloroaniline are dissolved i. o acetone and then a solution of 246 g 3 moles of sodium acetate in 800 ml of water is added thereto. With stirring, 190 ml 2,5 moles of chloroacetyl chloride are added tropwise to the mixture in the course of 3 hours while keeping the temperature at 35 to 550C. When the addition is complete stirring of the obtained suspension is continued for a further 2 hours at room temperature and thereafter 400 ml of ice water are added whereby the suspension becomes thick. After the batch is cooled to 50 100C,the formed chloroacetyl 3 chloro aniline is collected with suction, washed thoroughly with water and dried in vacuo at 500C. Yield 395,2 g 96,6 of theory. Melting point 99 101 C. 152,7 g 0,75 mole of chloroacetyl 3 chloro aniline are dissolved in 300 ml of absolute ethanol and then 160,0 g 2,25 moles of pyrrolidine are slowly added exothermic reaction and the mixture is then boiled under reflux for 5 hours with stirring. The crude product is then concentrated in vacuo Rotavap , and the concentrate dissolved in methylene chloride, washed twice with water and the extract methylene chloride phase is dried over Na2 SO4. After filtration, the solution is concentrated by evaporation under vacuoYield 170,4 g of pyrrolidino acetic acid 3 chloro anilide in form of a brown oil 95,1 of theory . The oil solidifies after some days and the solid product melts at 51 540C. 14,3 g 0,06 mole of pyrrolidinoacetic acid 3 chloroanilide are dissolved in 50 ml of ethyl acetate and then 9,4 g 0,078 mole of allyl bromide are added. The reaction mixture is refluxed for 3 hours and the quaternised end product initially separates out as an oil which chrystallises after a brief time.After filtration with suction, washing with ethyl acetate and drying invacuo at 500C, 21,5 g 99,5 of theory of the quaternary allyl pyrrolidino bromide of the formulaEMI8.1 are obtained. Mqffling point 144 1470C. The product is colourless, soluble in water 3,7 and methanol 30 and stable against hydrolysis in all pK ranges from 3 to 10. Other non pAytotixic salts may be prepared in an analogous manner, for example the chloride and iodide. From these halides, other non phytotoxic salts maybe prepared by known methods, such as the nitrate, sulfonate, trifluoromethanesulphonate, the sulphate, chlorate, acetate, borate tartrate, succinate, phosphate etc. The compositi ons according to the invention are obtained in known manner by intimately mixing and or grinding active substances of the formula I with suitable carriers , with or without the addition of dispersants or solents which are inert towards the active substances.

The concentrations of active substance in these compositions is 5 to 80 . Wettable powders and pastes are obtained by mixing and prinding the active substances with dispersing agents and pulverulent carriers in suitable devices until homogeneity is attained. Suitable carriers are, for eacm.ple, tl cse already mentioned for the solid forms of application.In sce cases it is advantageous to use mixtures of different carriers As dispersing agents there can be used, for example, conden sation products of sulphonated naphthalene and sulphonated naphthalene derivatives with formaldehyde , condensation pro ducts of naphthalene or naphthalene sulphonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, as well as alkali metal, ammonium and alkaline earth metal salts of lignin sulphonic acid, in addition, alkylaryl sulphonates, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts of dibutyl napithalene sulphonic acid, fatty alcohol sulphates such as salts of sulphated hexa b decanols, heptadecanols, octadecanols, and salts of sulphated fatty alcohol glycol ethers, the sodium salt of oleyl methy tauride, ditertiary acetalene glycols, dialkyl dilauryl ammonium chlorideand fatty acid alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts. Suitable anti foam agents are for example silicones.

Emulsion concentraes and passes are nanmfactured by using dispersing agents, such as those cited previously above, organic solvents, and water. Examples of suitable solvents are alcohols, benzene, xylenes, toluenc, dimethyl sulpllov ide, and mineral oil fractions which boil between 120 and 350 C. The solvents must be practically odourless, not phytotoxic, inert to the active substancesand not readily inflammable . Furthermore, the agents according to te invention can be applied in the form of solutions. For this purpose the active substances or several active substances of the general formula I are dissolved in suitable organic solvents, mixtures of solvents, or in water. Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated derivatives thereof, alkylnaphthalenes and mineral oils, by themselves or in admixture, can be used as organic solvents.

The compositions of this invention can be mixed with other biocidally active substances or agents. Tr us in order to broaden the activity spectrum the compositions my contin, for example, insecticides, fungicides, bacteri cides, fungistats, bacteriostats or nematocides, in addition to the cited compounds of the formula I. The compositions of the invention may also contain plant fertilisers, trace elements etc. formulations of one of the novel active compounds of the formula I are described hereinafter. The parts denote parts by weight. Granules The following substances are used to produce 5o 0 granules 5 parts of the bromide of the Example, 0.25 parts of epichlorohydrin, 0.25 parts of cetyl polyglycol ether, 3.50 parts of polyethylene glycol Carbowax , 91 parts of kaolin particle size 0.2 O.8 mm . The active substance is mixed with epichlorohydrin and dissolved with 6 parts of acetone the polyethylene glycol and cetyl polyglycol ether are then added. The re sultant solution is sprayed on kaolin, and the acetone is subsequently evaporated in vacuo. The resultant granules are particularly suitable for incorporation into the soil which is intended for rearing ornamental plant cuttings whose growth is to be inhibited.Wettable powder The following constituents are used for the pre paration of a a 40 , b a5070,c a 25 , and d a 10 wettable powder a 40 parts of the compound of the Example 5 parts of sodium lignin sulphate, 1 part of sodium dibutyl naphthalene sulphonates 54 parts of silicic acid. b 50 parts of the foresaid active substance, 5 parts of alkylarylsulphonate Tinovetin Bit , 10 parts of calcium ligninsulphonate, 1 part of a mixture of Champagne chalk hydroxyethyl cellulose mixture 1 1 , 20 parts of silicic acid, 14 parts of kaolin.c 25 parts of the active substance, 5 parts of the sodium salt of oleylmethyltauride, 2.5 parts of naphthalenesulphonic acid formaldehyde condensate, 0.5 part of carboxymethyl cellulose, 5 parts of neutral potassium aluminium silicate, 62 parts of kaolin.d 10 parts of the active substance, 3 parts of a mixture of the sodium salts of saturat ed fatty alcohol sulphates, 5 parts of naphthalenesulphonic acid formaldehyde condensate, 82 parts of kaolin. The active substance is homogeneously mixed in suitable mixers with the additives and the mixture is then ground in appropriate mills and rollers. Wettable powders are obtained which can be diluted with water to give suspensions of the desired concentration. Such suspensions can be used for example for inhibiting the growth of soya, cuttings, ornamentals etc.Emulsion ConcentrateThe following ingredients are mixed to prepare 25 emulsion concentrates a 25 parts of the active substance, 5 parts of a mixture of nonylphenolpolyoxy ethylene and calcium dodecylbenzenesul phonate 70 parts o xylene.b 25 parts of the active substance, 10 parts of a mixture of nonylphenolpolyoxy ethylene and calcium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, 65 parts of cyclohexanone.This concentrate can be diluted with water to give suitable concentrations. Such emulsions are suitable for inhibiting the growth of dicotyledonous plants such a soyabeans, ornamentals etc. As has already been mentioned, the compositions of the present invention are suitable for inhibiting the vegetative growth especially of dicotyledonous plants by imparting a more compact form to these plants. The active compounds of the compositions have only a low toxicity to warm blooded animals LD50 rat peroral 1313 mg kg LD rat dermal 3100 mg kg . When used in reasonable amounts, the quaternary salts cause no damage to the plants. The novel compositions and the actIve compounds contained therein retard the vegetative growth, promote blossoming, the ripening of fruit and to some extend also the formation of separation tissue. The principal field of use of these compositions of the present invention is the inhibition of growth in cultures of soya and other leguminosac, and particularly in ornamentals, bushes hedgerows and trees. By inhibiting growth it is possible, for example, to sow the plants in soya cultures in more narrowly spaced rows, which in turn makes a greater yield possible per unit of area. The plants are of smaller growth, develop strong green leaves and, in proportion to the leaves, a greater biossoming and set of fruit. The tighter spacing of the plants affords better protection against their being beaten te te ground by rain and wind. In tobacco plants, the growth inhibition prevents chiefly the formation of side shoots or suckers, a factor whiM aids the development of large strong leaves.The application of the compositions of the invention effects in grasses, especially in southern warm season grasses, a slower growth, whereby for example areas of grass need be cut less often.The growth inhibition of ornamental plants and shrubs results in smaller plants of regular proportions with shorter stalks. Ornamentals shrubs require less frequent cutting.The extent and nature of the action depend on a wide variety of factors according to the species of the plant, in particular on the application concentration, and the time of application with regard to the development stage of the plant. The active substances are applied preferably in the form of liquid compositions both to the parts of plants above the soil and to those on or in the soil.The application to the parts of plants above the soil is preferred, for which purpose solutions or aqueous dispersions are most suitable.The rates of application must be adapted to the cultivated plant, the time of application and are advantageously between 0.01 and 2 kg per hectare. Inhibition of the vegetative growth and yield increase of soya plantsSoya plants of the variety Hark were reared in earthenware pots and sprayed at the 5 trifoliate leaf stage with aqueous preparations of the active substance of the Example. The active substance concentrations in the spray broth were 500, 100 and 50 ppm respectively. The plant growth was evaluated 4 weeks after application in accordance with the following linear rating 1 strong inhibition no growth from the time of application 9 no inhibition growth as untreated controls The yield increase was evaluated at the sime time in percent increase of the pods when compared with the yield of pods obtained with untreated control plants.Value A expresses the increase in number of podsValue B express the t increase in weight of pods.EMI20.1 tb SEP SEP increase SEP of SEP pods tb SEP Inhibition SEP rating SEP 500 SEP ppm SEP 100 SEP ppm SEP 1 SEP 50p,Dm SEP tb 500 SEP Dm SEP 100 SEP ppm.

Therefore in horticulture the aim is to cultivate, on a large scale, ornamentals of smaller size without affecting the flowers with respect to size and beauty. Normally a height reduction of 20 to 35 is desired and should be predictible by the rates of plant growth inhibitor used. The known growth inhibitor Alar commat which is succinic acid mono N dimethylhydrazide Daminozide of formulaEMI21.1 has the disadvantage of high prize, high dosage rates necessary for obtaining the desired growth reduction effect 3000 to 5000 ppm and the fact that the activity depends very critically on the dosage rate, the activity increasing considerably when a somewhat higher dosage rate is used. Therefore the desired height of ornamentals is difficult to predeterminate. Furthermore Alar commat is only taken up by the leaves and therefore cannot be applied to the soil no root uptake by drench or granule application.The quaternary salts of the present invention do not have these drawbacks they are lower in prize, the necessary dosage rate for attaining a 20 to 35 reduction of the height of the ornamentals is between 100 and 500 ppm and the desired activity growth reduction can be well predeterminated by the choice of the dosage rate when a standard rate is doubled the growth reduction effect becomes 5 to 108 higher. Therefore for a specific ornamental any desired height to achieve after a certain time can be predeterminated by the choice of the dosage rate. The quaternary salts of the invention furthermore may be applied both by the leaves foliar spray as through the roots by drench or granule application to the soil.Trials under practical conditions on chrysanthemums have shown that the compound of the Example causes a uniform and reproducible inhibition of internode growth. This inhibition is independent of environmental conditions e.g. it is not light dependent . Depending on the applied rate, any desired degree of growth inhibition can be obtained.The leaf size of treated plants is not reduced and the leaves are deeper green.Even with strong overdoses, no phytotoxicity in the form of necrosis has been observed. However, an increased delay of flowering may occur 2 to 3 days . Biological Tests on ChrysanthemumsIn these tests chrysanthemum varieties were used which, on account of their strong growth, can only be reared as pot plants in combination with growth inhibitors.About 25 days after potting 14 days after pinching the plants were sprayed with aqueous preparations of the active substance of the Example and with Alar known inhibitior for comparison . The dosage rates are indicated in the following tables. The growth in height of the plants was measured after three different periods see table and the growth inhibition is expressed in percent of the height measured on untreated plants check 0 reduction .Depending on the variety the optimal growth inhibition 20 to 35 was obtained with rates between 125 250 ppm of the active ingredient of the Example in sufficient water to wet all the foliage. With one variety a soil drench application was also performed.The following tables show the performance of the quaternary salt of the Example of this specification EMI23.1 on different chrysanthemum varieties compare with the standard compound Daminozide or Alar EMI24.1 The delay in flowering was evaluated as follows 3 4 days delay DAA Days after application 4 7 days delayNo phytotoxicity occured in any trial.Table I Chrysanthemum variety Regal Anne EMI24.2 tb Compound SEP rate SEP height SEP reduction SEP against SEP check tb SEP ppm SEP 11 SEP DAS SEP 30 SEP DAA SEP 55 SEP DAA tb SEP A SEP tb roliar SEP spray SEP 3400 SEP 40 SEP 40 SEP 25 tb SEP B SEP 125 SEP 10 SEP 25 SEP 25 tb foliar SEP spray SEP 250 SEP 25 SEP 50 SEP 25 SEP tb SEP 500 SEP 25 SEP 60 SEP 40 SEP tb SEP 1000 SEP 25E SEP 60 SEP 40 tb SEP 2000 SEP 40E SEP 75 tb SEP B tb Soil SEP drench SEP 250 SEP 255 SEP 50 tb Table II Chrysanthemum variety Golden Anne EMI25.1 Compound SEP rate SEP height SEP reduction SEP against SEP check tb SEP ppm SEP 14 SEP DAA SEP 32 SEP DAAA SEP 39 SEP DAA tb foliar SEP spray SEP 3400 SEP 30 SEP 30 SEP 25 tb SEP B SEP 125 SEP 10 SEP 30 SEP 208 tb foliar SEP spray SEP 250 SEP 20 SEP 35 tb SEP 500 SEP 30 SEP 40 tb Table III Chrysanthemum variety Aglow EMI25.2 tb Compound SEP rate SEP height SEP reduction SEP against SEP check tb SEP A SEP ppm SEP 14 SEP DAA SEP 32 SEP DAA SEP 39 SEP DAA SEP tb foliar SEP spray SEP 3400 SEP 20 SEP 30 SEP 25 tb SEP B SEP 125 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 10 tb foliar SEP spray SEP 250 SEP 10 SEP 10 SEP 25 tb SEP 500 SEP 15 SEP 25 SEP 30 tb Table IV Chrysanthemum variety Wedgewood EMI26.1 tb Compound SEP rate SEP height SEP reduction SEP against SEP check tb SEP ppm SEP 14 SEP DAA SEP 32 SEP DAA SEP 39 SEP DAA tb SEP A tb foliar SEP spray SEP 3400 SEP 30 SEP 30 SEP 25 SEP tb SEP B SEP 125 SEP 10 SEP 10 SEP 20 tb foliar SEP spray SEP 250 SEP 158 SEP 15 SEP 25 tb SEP 500 SEP 15 SEP 25 SEP 25t SEP tb The recommended rates for chrysanthemum varieties are foliar spray 100 500 ppm of compound B of the Example soil deach not higher than 250 ppmSimilar good results are obtainable also on poinsettias and salvia spp. For poinsettias the rates should be 2 to 4 times higher than for chrysanthemum, i.e. 200 to 2000 ppm for foliar spray.
