# Use of acid salts in dyeing and or printing processes.

## Abstract
Dyeing and or printing process which employs as an additive a composition comprising one or more cations selected from ammonium, Group I and Group II metals of the Periodic Tables due to Mendeleef, one or more carboxylate anions and water, the ratio of the anion to the cation being in the range of 2 1 and 4 1 on a chemical equivalent basis. The additive can be incorporated into the dyeing and or printing process at various points in the process, for example at the stages of scouring of the fabric, mordanting, levelling, exhaustion, fixing finishing, waterproofing and milling. They are less corrosive to skin, clothing, plastics and metal and hence are safer to the operative and do not promote deterioration of equipment.
