## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ENHANCING THE FLUX RATE OFCROSS FLOW FILTRATION SYSTEMSThe present invention relates to cross flow filtration for removal of suspended and collidal solids and or emulsified oil from liquids, particularly water, wastewater, industrial wastes, and industrial process streams.More specifically, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for increasing the rate of transfer of liquids containing such solids and or oil across a porous crossflow filter tube referred to herein as the filtration flux In water and wastewater treatment, clarifiers and throughflow filters are conventionally used for removal of suspended and colloidal solids. Such systems have inherent disadvantages. Without preclarification, most filters are unable to handle the resulting higher solids loadings. Likewise, even with a clarifier in the process train, filtered particles continuously accumulate on and within throut flow filter media.The filter flux rate decreases with time or headloss increases and frequent backwashing is required to remove the accumulated solids from the filter medium. When product water is used for backwashing there is a significant net decrease in total water production. Relatively large volumes of low solids wastewater are also created which must receive some type of further handling. There is also the problem of filter breakthrough. Moreover, water quality is extremely process dependent.Cross flow filtration is substantially different from through flow filtration, in that feed water is introduced parallel to the filter surface, and filtration occurs in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the feed flow. Cross flow filtration satisifes a much wider range of applications and provides economic benefits that other conventional options do not. Cross flow filtration systems are capable of clarification, filtration, and thickening in one process step. Equipment costs approach those of direct filtration yet cross flow filtration is capable of filtering streams that contain suspended solids concentrations of 10,000 mg L or higher. Furthermore, crossflow systems require less space than conventional systems.Cross flow filtration systems include membrane systems such as microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration.The major disadvantages of the latter two membrane processes in liquids solids separation are low flux rates and susceptibility to fouling. These liabilities ultimately translate into high system construction and operating costs. However, both of these problems have been virtually eliminated in a new method of cross flow microfiltration utilizing thick walled porous thermoplastic tubes sold under the trademark HYDROPERMTF The filtration characteristics of these tubes combine both the tin depth filtration aspects of multi medial filters and the 7 thin skinned aspects of membrane ultrafilters The porosity of HYDROPERM tubes results from the open cell reticulated structure of the tube wall. HYDROPERM tubes differ from conventional membrane ultrafilters, in that they have pore sizes on the order of several microns, wherein the length of a pore is many times that of its diameter. These tubes are described in greater detail, for example, in HYDROPERM CROSS FLOW MICROFILTRATION , Daniel L. Comstock, et al., Neptune Microfloc, Inc.,Report No. KT 7307, May 1982, and in Report No. 77 ENAS 51 of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, entitled Removal of Suspended and Collidal Solids from WasteStreams by the Use of Cross FLow Mierofiltration , which reports are hereby incorporated herein by reference to the extent necessary for a thorough understanding of the background of the invention.Feed flow is through the center of HYDROPERM tubes at a relatively low pressure, typically less than 30 psi. The filtrate is typically collected in a jacket surrounding the exterior tube wall and withdrawn therefrom by a product line. As feed flow circulates through the tube, solid particles are slowly driven with the product flow toward the tube wall. Thus, the concentration of particles in regions close to the inner wall steadily increases.In cross flow filtration systems generally, because the direction of the feed flow is tangential to the filter surface, accumulation of the filtered solids on the filtering medium is reduced by the sharing action of the flow. Cross flow filtration thus affords the possiblity of a quasi steady state operation with a nearly constant flux when the driving pressure differential is held constant. Unfortunately, this theoretical possibility has not been achieved in practice. Thus, the problem of declining filtration fluxes has plagued conventional cross flow filtration systems. In general, any liquid from which suspended solids removal is desired will contain a wide range of particulate sizes, ranging in effective diameter from several microns down to colloidal dimensions. Because of the in depthtT filtration characteristics of thick walled, theremoplastic tubes, such as HYDROPERiMtubes, particles smaller than the largest pore size of the tube may, under certain circu,. stances, enter the wall matrix. In any event, above a certain solids concentration in the feed, the majority of the suspended solids are retained at the inner wall of the tube and quickly form a dynamic membrane also referred to as a filter cake or sludge layer . The dynamic membrane is, we believe, largely responsible for the filtration which subsequently occurs.For tubular cross flow filters to work most efficiently, a certain minimum suspended solids concentration must be present. Below this minimum, individual pores of the tube are blocked by individual particles blocking filtration . This results in rapid flux declines. Above this minimum, particles become self supporting and form a filter cake over the pores of the tube. In cake filtration, the tube matrix does not become blocked. This is the desired filtration mechanism, since resistance is minimal through a cake and maximum through a partially blocked tube matrixIn view of the fact that an increase in filtration flux will permit far more economical processing of solids laden liquids, the art has sought methods for increasing the filtration flux in cross flow filtration systems.Various cleaning techniques have previously been investigated for restoring the filtration flux value.Such cleaning techniques have involved chemical anchor physical cleaning of the surface of the filter medium.For example, chemical solvents have been used to dissolve the layer building filtered particles so as to yield a clean, layer free filter surface. On the other hand, a simple physical cleaning technique commonly used is back flushing of the filter medium, i.e., temporary reversal of the filtrate flow direction. This cleaning technique is frequently used in conjunction with crossflow filtration processes utilizing hollow tubular filters.Despite the success of the above noted cleaning procedures, the cross flow filtration art continues to search for new techniques for improving such cleaning processes and for increasing filtration fluxes, in order to make crossflow filtration processes more economical.Filtration fluxes through tubular cross flow filtration modules can be increased by increasing the active filter tube surface area in the modules by, for example, increasing the length of the filter tubes. However, the pressure losses normally encountered across such crossflow filtration modules, including friction losses, constitute a significant factor in limiting the practical length of conventional filter tubes. Consequently, it would be highly desirable to effectively remove or overcome such losses, so as to permit the practical use of considerably longer filter tubes, thereby increasing filtration fluxes. To date, this need remains unsolved.The present invention overcomes the above noted problems and disadvantages of the prior art by providing a method and apparatus for increasing the cross flow filtration flux of solids laden liquids through a filter tube by maintaining the filtration flux rate transversely through the filter tube wall at substantially the same value along the entire length of the filter tube during filtration. The degree of flux enhancement obtained in accordance with the present invention depends to varying degrees upon the characteristics of the particular liquid feed being processed, and particularly the chemicals, if any, added as pretreatment, and the characteristics of the suspended solids, as well as various operational parameters of the overall cross flow filtration process, including the filter tube cleaning techniques utilized, e.g. backflushing Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations, particularly pointed out in the appended claims.To achieve the objects and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the invention comprises a method of increasing the crossflow filtration flux of a liquid through an elongated porous filter tube, comprising the steps of flowing a portion of the liquid transversely through the filter tube wall by establishing a pressure differential across the filter tube wall and maintaining the filtration flux rate transversely through the filter tube wall at substantially the same value along the entire length of the filter tu during filtration.Typically, the portion of the liquid exiting from the downstream end of the filter tube is recycled back to the feed end of the filter tube via a return line having a recycle pump operatively connected thereto, and the filtration flux rate is maintained at substantially the same value along the entire length of the filter tube by pumping make up of the liquid to be filtered into the return line at a point between the downstream end of the filter tube and the recycle pump connection, whereby the pressure drop measured between a point immediately upstream of the feed end and a point immediately following the downstream end is approximately zero during filtration. The flow rate of the make up liquid is preferably selected to equal the flow rate of the filtrate permeated through the filter tube wall.Broadly, the method of the invention further comprises the additional step of periodically backflushing a liquid transversely through the filter tube wall from the filtrate side by reversing the direction of the pressure differential, thereby physically cleaning the filter tube. Typically, the back flushed liquid includes the filtrate and the duration of each back flushing period is about 2 seconds and the interval between backflushings is within the range of from about 1 minute to about 2 minutes.The invention, in its broadest apsects, also comrpises apparatus for increasing the cross flow filtration flux of a liquid through an elongated porous filter tube, comprising an elongated porous filter tube means for flowing the liquid into the tube and for flowing a portion of the liquid transversely through the filter tube wall, including means for establishing a pressure differential across the filter tube wall and means for maintaining the filtration flux rate transversely through the filter tube wall at substantially the same value along the entire length of the filter tube during filtrationBroadly, the apparatus of the invention further comprises a recycle line fluidly connected between the outlet and the feed end of the filter tube, a recycle pump operatively connected to the recycle line for recycling the portion of the liquid exiting from the outlet back to the feed end, and wherein the means for maintaining the filtration flux rate at substantially the same value along the entire length of the filter tube includes a make up pump operatively connected to the recycle line at a point between the tube outlet and the recycle pump connection for pumping make up of the liquid to be filtered into the recycle line, thereby maintaining the pressure drop measured between a point immediately upstream of t e feed end a point immediately following the outlet at approximately zero during filtration.Typically, a plurality of the elongated porous filter tubes are provided, the tubes being encased in a filtrate collection jacket, with the tubes and the jacket forming a filtration module, and the apparatus includes means operatively connected to the filtrate collection jacket for periodically backflushing a liquid transversely through the filter tube wall from the filtrate side by reversing the direction of the pressure differential, thereby physically cleaning the filter tube. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate various features of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.Fig. 1 is a schematic flow diagram, in partial crosssection, showing a conventional prior art cross flow filtration tube module, showing the direction of fe flow circulation and the direction of filtrate flow permeation , Fig. 2 is a schematic flow diagram illustrating another conventional prior art cross flow filtration tube module and Fig. 3 is a schematic flow diagram illustrating the preferred embodiment of the present invention.Reference will now be made in detail to the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in Fig. 3 of the accompanying drawings.Cross flow filtration in accordance with the invention may be accomplished, for example, using thick walled, micr oporous thermoplastic tubes. These tubes can be made from a wide variety of extrudable thermoplastics, such as, for example, nylon or polyethylene, and typically have walls of about one millimeter in thickness. Although subject to variation, such tubes may, for example, possess a dominant pore size on the order of about one to ten microns and a porosity on the order of about 65 i.e., the pores cover 65 of the surface area of the tubes. The preferred, although certainly not the only, porous thermoplastic tubes useful in practicing the present invention are the previously mentioned HYDROPERtubes having the characteristics referred to above, which tubes are presently commercially available from Neptune Microfloc,Inc., of Corvallis, Oregon.A schematic view of conventional cross flow filtration through such a thick walled, microporous thermoplastic tube is shown in Fig. 1. A liquid feed flows through the inside of the tube at relatively low pressures, e.g., 2 to 50 psi, and filtrate permeation occurs through the tube wall, which is relatively thick, e.g. on the order of about one millimeter.During the initial stages of microfiltration, a majority of the suspended solids in the feed is deposited onto the wall as the dynamic membrane sludge layer . The growth of this dynamic membrane is limited by the shear forces acting on it due to the circulation velocity of the liquid flowing lengthwise along the tube. This shearing action takes the form of erosion. The balance of the deposition rate and the erosion rate of the dynamic membrane establishes an equilibrium sludge layer thickness, and therefore the equilibrium plateau fluxes, for the feed being filtered. This balancing condition is critically dependent on the characteristics of the suspended solid in the feed liquid. Two types of suspended solids can be categorized as limiting cases, namely, thtjfl which are cohesionless and those which are cohesive.For cohesive solids, the bonding stress between particles is relatively large, so that once they are brought into contact, higher shearing force is required to break their bond. In other words, this type of solid requires a relatively strong erosion effect. On the other hand, cohesionless solids have weak bonds with respect to each other and are therefore much more easily eroded. Even in the case of a cohesionless solid, however, binding to the interior wall of the filter tube may occur, thus producing a thin, adhering layer immediately adjacent to the wall, which will require a strong erosion effect to remove it.Other parameters that govern solids behaviour are the effective solid particle diameter and the particle size distribution in the feed. The characteristics of tne feed liquid itself, such as pH, viscosity, etc , may also show some influence on the behaviour of the suspended solids in the feed. Chemical additives are commonly used in wastewater treatment, and their addition to the wastewater will also change the characteristics of the suspended solids, and thus will vary the flux rate.Since it is desirable to render the dynamic membrane on the filter tube wall cohesionless, chemical pretreatment of the feed prior to cross flow filtration may prove advantageous in practicing the invention in conjunction with the filtration of many liquids. In general, the objective of such pretreatment should be to obtain a feed comprising a fluffy or loose type, cohesionless floc. Examples of typical conventional pretreatment additives suitable for use in the present invention include, without limitation, conventional flocculants e.g., calcium hydroxide, alum, calcium sulfate, ferric hydroxide, etc. , polyelectrolyte flocculants, and additives such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No.4 313 830.As previously noted, conventional cross flow filtration devices including microfilters, ultrafilters and reverse osmosis units, experience a decline in flux rate during filtration runs until an equilibrium plateau flux rate is attained. Flux rates F observed during the initial non equilibrium phase of a filtration run are proportional to the feed velocity V , the pressure differential P , and time t . In contrast, the flux rates observed during the equilibrium phase i.e.plateau fluxes are propqrtional essentially only to feed velocity.Fig. 2 is a schematic flow diagram, in partial cross section, showing a conventional prior art filtration tube module. The suspended solids and or emulsified oil laden liquid to be filtered flows through a filter tube module 10 in the direction shown by the arrows. As shown, tube module 10 includes three microporous filter tubes 11 e.g., HYDROPERMtubes encased within a closed filtrate collection jacket 12. Preferably, commercial scale tube modules 10 will include a plurality as many as hundreds of filter tubes 11 arranged in a parallel tube bundle not shown within a single jacket 12. A conventional inlet circulation pump not shown provides the requisite inlet pressure P1 and liquid flow velocity V1 in feed line 13.A portion of the liquid is permeated transversely through the wall of filter tubes 11, thereby depositing at least a portion of the solids emulsified oil on the inner surface of tubes 11 as a dynamic membrane not shown .is discussed previously. The liquid permeated through filter tubes 11 i.e. the filtrate is collected in coe jacket 12 surrounding filter tubes 11, and the collected liquid is removed from jacket 12 via a port 14 extending through the jacket and connected to product filtrate line 15. The filtrate exit pressure in product line 5, designated P5 , is essentially zero in conventional crossflow filtration systems.The portion of the liquid which is not permeated through the wall of filter tubes 11 exits from module 10 via a port not shown in jacket 12 and via exit line 17 connected thereto at a velocity designated V4 and at an exit pressure designated P4, as shown. A conventional back pressure valve not shown is typically situated in exit line 17 to establish a net positive pressure in filter tubes 11, as known in the art. The flux enhancement technique of the present inventin is preferably practiced together with a conventional orm of physical cleaning of the filter medium, namely, bazk flushing.In Fig. 2, P values are the pressures at the indicated locations V values are the fluid velocities at the indicated locations and Hf ls the friction loss across the tube module.Referring still to Fig. 2, in conventional cross flow filter modules 10, feedwater enters the filtration module 10 at A. Filtrate exits at D, and the reject exits at E. Pressure losses normally encountered across such conventional modules 10 include 1 the module entrance loss at B, 2 the friction loss, Hf, across the module and 3 the module exit loss at C.Table A lists the average headloss expressions in ft. of water for the module 10 depicted in Fig. 2.Table B lists calculated loss of head values for the module entrance and exit losses for an eight foot long filtration module similar to module 10. Also listed are the measured total pressure loss across the module fromA to E and the friction loss across the module, calculated by subtracting the calculated entrance and exit losses from the total measured loss. The module comprised two 4 ft. long modules fluidly connected in series, with 12 HYDROPERM filter tubes per module. The inner diameter of the modules was 1 1 2 inches, the inner diameter of each tube was 6 mm, and the total active tube surface area for the two modules was 5.6 sq. ft.The loss of head observed in conventional cross flow filtration devices is undesirable for a number of reasons.First, flux rate can be shown to be a function of the average driving pressure of the module P which, in the terminology of Fig. 2, is2, xpressed TABLE AHEADLOSS ITEMSEMI14.1 tb item SEP Averse SEP Lost SEP Head tb V2 2 tb 2g tb Friction SEP loss SEP f SEP SEP L SEP SEP y 2 SEP tb SEP V3 2 tb Exit SEP loss tb Notes 1. f is the friction coefficient of the filtration tube, L the tube length, and D the tube diameter.2.

Flux rate 804 gal day ft2.EMI15.1 Thus, when P3 is reduced to a value less than P2, t P will be decreased by an amount equal toEMI15.2 with a proportional drop in the flux rate. There is also an unequal distribution of flux across the module when P3 is less than P2, since A measured at B is greater than Pat C. Since filter tube foulirg is proportional the flux rate, the head feed end B of the module 10 WJ 11 foul at the greatest rate.Another unwanted consequence of P3 being less than P2 is that backflushing cleaning techniques will be less successful Backflushing is typically accomplisned by backflushing filtrate transversely through the filter tube wall from the filtrate side by reversing the direction of the pressure differential, i.e., so as to reverse the direction of flow in product line 15. When P3 is less than P2, the majority of the backflush flow will pass through the low pressure end of the filter tube C . The high pressure end of the module B , which is fouled the most severely will, thus, be cleaned least efficiently.It can therefore be seen that pressure loss is a significant factor which limits the length of conventional cross flow filtration modules. As an example, Table C lists the calculated friction losses for various length cross flow filter modules when operated at an average velocity of 8 feet second.Referring now to Fig. 3, the present invention comprises a method of increasing the cross flow filtration flux of a liquid through an elongated porous filter tube not shown in filtration system 21, comprising the steps of flowing a portion of the liquid transversely through the filter tube wall by establishing a pressure differential across the filter tube wall and maintaining the filtration flux rate transversely through the filter tube TABLE C MODULE LENGTH VERSUS FRICTION LOSSModule length, feet Friction loss, psi 4 2.32 8 4.65 12 6.97 16 9.30 20 11.62Notes 1. Filtration tubes are 0.236 inches I.D.2. Friction factor used to calcuate losses is 0.027. wall at substantially the same value along the entire length of the filter tube during filtration. Typically, the portion of the liquid exiting from the downstream outlet end C of the filter tube is recycled back to the feed end B of the filter tube via a return recycle line 30 having a recycle pump 34 operatively onne tei thereto.According to the invention, the filtration flux rate is maintained at substantially the same value along the entire length of the filter tibe tjt pumpirg makeup of the liquid to be filtered using pump 27 into the return line 30 at point E between the downstream end C of the filter tube and the recycle pump 34. As a result, the pressure drop measured between point A immediately upstream of the feed end of module 25 and point D immediately following the downstream end of the module is approximately zero during filtration.In a closed loop system such as that shown in Fig. 3, the flow rate of the make up liquid in line 28 must equal the flow rate of the filtrate permeated through the filter tube wall.Although the pressure losses are masked within module 2 , as described above, the recycle pump 34 must, nevertheless, be siied to account for the module entrance loss, the module exit loss and tne friction loss across the module The make up pump 27 serves to increase the system pressur Broadly, the method of the invention further comprises the step of periodically backflushing a liquid transversely trough the filter tube wall from the iltrate sid by reversing the direction of the pressure differential, here by physically cleaning the filter tube. Typically, the backflushed liquid includes the filtrate, the duration of each backflushing period is about 2 seconds, and the interval between backflushings is within the range of from about 1 minute to about 2 minutes. The backflusbing pressure is preferably on the order of about 50 psi.Typically, a plurality of elongated porous filter tubes not shown are provided in module 25, with the tubes being encased in a filtrate collection jacket not shown . The tubes and the jacket together form filtration module 25.The present invention has the effect within the filtration module of removing or overcoming i.e., masking pressure losses normally associated with the module. This is accomplished by a two pump system as diagrammed, for example, in Fig. 3. Feedwater enters the module at A and reject exits at D.In the present invention, additional pumping energy is supplied at E by the addition of make up water. This is a closed loop system with respect to the recycle, with periodic solids blowdown at valve 32 being provided. In accordance with the present invention, the pressure at D may be made to equal or even exceed the pressure at A by simply providing sufficient pressure at E.This is illustrated by the following energy balance for module 25 in units of pressure PA via 2 HAB HBC HCD HE D D 2g 2gWhere,PA Pressure at AVA Velocity at APD Pressure at DVD Velocity at D HAB Module entrance loss HBC Friction loss across moduleHCD Module exit lossHE Energy input at E When PA PD as desired in the present invention , 2g 2gTable D lists observed pressure and velocity data from an experiment conducted with a two pump apparatus such as that show in Fig. 3. The cross flow filtration experiment was conducted on a pilot sized unit 21 that contained one 6.71 foot long cross flow filtration module 25 with 4.8 ft2 of HYDROPERM active tube area.Water from a holding tank not shown was pumped into the system at about 37.5 psig by a make up pump 27. The make up stream 28 was mixed with a recycle stream 29 at E before entering a conventional solids classifier separator not shown . Suspended solids contained in the combined stream 30 were partially removed by centrifugal force and periodicaly blowndown from the bottom of the separator via valve 32. Water exiting from the top of the separate was pressurized by a conventional centrifugal recycle pume 34 to an average inlet press of 38 psig before enterirg the module 25.Filtration occurred transversely through the nYDROPERMMtube walls not shown and filtrate was collected on the shell side of module 25 and exited from the module via product line 36. The entrance velocity at B was 10 ft. per sec. and the exit velocity at C was 7 ft. per sec. All tests were conducted with an artificial impurity, namely, lime added to tap water 22 in the holding tank.The lime precipitated hardness in the water to form a 2 by wt. suspension of calcium carbonate that served as filterable material for the experiment.Backflushing was accomplished once per minute by reversing the flow direction in product line 36 for 2 seconds, using product water as the backflushing liquid and a driving pressure of 60 psig, in the manner discussed previously.Referring to Fig. 3, Qp is the filtrate flow rate gal. min. , Qm u is the make up flow rate gal. min. , and QREC is the recycle flow rate gal. min. .

Flux rate was 1.350 gal. Day ft2.Table D lists the measured liquid flow velocity ft. per sec. and pressure psi at location A i.e., immediately upstream of the feed end of module 25 and at location D i.e., immediately downstream of the outlet of module 25 .As can be seen, the measured pressure at location D was virtually equal to the measured pressure at location A.That is, the normal entrance loss, exit loss and friction. loss across module 25 were effectively removed or masked within the module. In the absence of such losses, module 25, and specifically, the filtration tubes in the module, can be constructed at any length desired to achieve maximum filtration fluxes.Table D also lists the calculated single pump i.e., conventional system pressures for comparison purposes.As shown, for a similar conventional single pump system, 4.7 psi pressure drop would be expected across a similar length module i.e., the difference between the pressure calculated at A and that calculated at D . These conventional values were calculated on the basis of the following assumptions 1 make up pump 27 was eliminated from the system 2 reject line 29 has a conventional back pressure valve not shown and reject flows into an open tank not shown 3 recycle pump 34 would be fed directly from the open tank and 4 average liquid flow velocity inside the porous filtration tubes of 7.6 ft. per sec.The present invention thus advances the cross flow filtration art by masking pressure losses within the filtlon module, thereby removing such losses as z factor in limiting maximum module tube length and permitting increased filtration fluxes, and by improving the effeciency of backflusing cleaning technique by providing a constant flux rate along the entire length of the filter tubes.Referring to Fig. 3, the flux enhancement in accordance with the invention is critically dependent on the proper sizing of the recycle pump 34 and the make up pump 27.Failure to do so will result in unequal pressures at points A and D in the system. For example, if the recycle pump 34 is oversized, the pressure at A will be greater than the pressure at D. Conversely, if the make up pump 27 is oversized, the pressure at D may exceed the pressure at A Preferably, such situations should be avoided in practicing the invention.The recycle pump 34 must be sized to provide the desired recycle flow rate QREC at the total dynamic friction head generated within the filtration loop. For a loop such as that shown in Fig. 3, such friction losses include 1 all piping and fitting losses between the recycle pump discharge point and the filtration tube module entrance at A, 2 module entrance, exit and friction losses, and 3 piping and fitting losses between the filtration tube module exit at D and the recycle pump intake. For the system shown in Fig. 3, the make up pump 27 must be sized to pump a flow rate equal to the product filtrate flow rate Qp at the desired filtration module exit pressure at D plus the total friction head e.g., piping and fitting losses between the make up pump discharge point and point E, immediatley following the filtration tube module exit at D pressure at D andE may properly be assumed to be equal . That is, the total dynamic head for the make up pump equals the desired pressure at D plus the friction head losses between the make up pump discharge point and point E.With regard to the specific type of pumps to be utilized for the recycle pump 34 and the make up pump 27, conventional centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps may be used for each. However, centrifugal pumps are preferred because of their versatility, simplicity and availability. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the above described embodiments of the invention without darting from the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. As an example, the invention can have application to cross flow filtration systems other than microfiltration, such as, for example, ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis systems. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention, provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
