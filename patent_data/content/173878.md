# Circular cable coating nozzle and method of coating.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for coating telephone cable or other continuous lengths of cylindrical objects with a continuous coating of molten thermoplastic sealant material. The cable or cylindrical object is passed through an annular array of nozzles operative to apply multiple beads of molten thermoplastic material to the surface of the cable or object. A liquid impervious casing is then placed over the bead coated cable while the beads are still in a molten state. The casing compresses the beads and forms them into a continuous coating of thermoplastic material surrounding the cable or object and contained within the liquid impervious casing.
