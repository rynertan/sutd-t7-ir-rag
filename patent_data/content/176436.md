## Description
TITLE OF INVENTIONANALOGS OF SUBSTANCE P AND ELEDOISINSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Analogs of substance P and eledoisin with general structural formula EMI1.1 are useful in the treatment of dry eye syndrome by stimulation of lachrymal secretion. They also demonstrate analgesic, anti inflammatory, hypotensive and CNS activity. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Substance P and eledoisin are naturally occurring undecapeptides belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides so named because of their prompt stimulatory action on smooth muscle. Eledoisin was originally isolated from the posterior salivary glands of the Mediterranean octopod Eledone moschata. A mammalian tachykinin is substance P, a neuropeptide originally isolated from gut. These peptides have the following amino acid sequences Glu Pro Ser Lys Asp Ala Phe Ile Gly Leu Met NH eledoisin 6 7 8 9 10 11Arg Pro Lys Pro Gln Gln Phe Phe Gly Leu Met NH2 substance P These materials suffer the typical shortcomings of pharmacologically active peptides such as susceptibility to enzymatic degradation and lack of pharmacological specificity which severely limit their use as therapeutic agents.Modification by incorporation of D amino acids and or N methyl amino acids and shortening of the peptides to six amino acids has produced compounds with enhanced metabolic stability Sandberg et al., J. Med. Chem., 25, 1009 1982 The Peptides, Vol.II, Schroder and Luke, Eds., pp. 137 152 1966 . The shortest active sequence demonstrating eledoisin activity and selectivity has been 6 7 8 9 10 11 Glu Phe Phe Gly Leu Met NH2 which corresponds to the last six amino acids of substance P. Another technique which has been employed for altering the pharmacological and biochemical properties of peptides comprises the introduction of conformational constraints imposed by formation of relatively rigid ring systems within the peptide chains Freidinger et al., Science, 210, 656 658 1980 Freidinger et al., J. Org. Chem., 47, 104 1982 . Now, with this invention there are provided peptides related to substance P and eledoisin with increased activity, increased selectivity for eledoisin receptors and increased resistance to protease degradation through the use of lactam conformational constraints, optionally in combination with other methods of peptide modification.

The pharmaceutical preparation may also be in the form of a solid insert such as one which after dispensing the drug remains essentially intact, or a bio erodible insert that either is soluble in lachrymal fluids, or otherwise disintegrates.
