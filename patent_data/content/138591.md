# SCREENING METHOD FOR RED BLOOD CELL ABNORMALITY

## Abstract
Red cell samples are passed through a zone of focused illu mination, and a scatter vs. time pulse is obtained for each. Each pulse is analyzed for pulse width, pulse area, and pulse shape. These parameters are respectively collected, and three coeffi cents of variation are obtained for each such collection. In ad dition to these three abnormality factors, the mean of the pulse shape collection constitutes a fourth. The four are respectively subject to statistical criteria, and are combined in predeter mined fashion for a single red cell morphology index.
