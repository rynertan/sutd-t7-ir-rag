# CATALYST SYSTEM FOR THE PRODUCTION OF POLYURETHANES

## Abstract
A catalyst and process are provided for producing polyurethanes by contacting an organic polyol and an organic isocyanate with a catalyst comprising an N substituted alkoxyalkyl piperazine and preferably additional ly comprising an N alkoxyalkyl morpholine wherein the alkylene moieties of the morpholine and piperazine are independently selected from the group consisting of C₁ to about C₅ alkylene moieties, and wherein the alkoxy moieties are independently selected from the group consisting of C₁ to about C₃ alkoxy moieties.
