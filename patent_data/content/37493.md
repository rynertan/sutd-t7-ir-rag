# Voice analyzing apparatus.

## Abstract
A voice analyzing apparatus is provided with a plurality of cascade connected delay filter circuits 100 1 100 P . Each of delay filter circuits includes a delay circuit 113 i for delaying a first input signal, a coefficient generating circuit 119 i, 120 i , and an operation circuit for generating first and second output signals, the first output signal representing the differ ence between the product of output signals applied from the delay circuit 113 i and the coefficient generating circuit 119 i, 120 i and a second input signal, and the second output signal representing the difference between the product of a second input signal and an output signal from the coefficient generating circuit 119 i, 120 i and the output signal from the delay circuit 113 i . The coefficient generating circuit 119 i, 120 i includes a correction circuit 120 i for attenuating the product of output signal of delay circuit 113 i and second difference signal, and a coefficient generator 119 i for adding the output signal thereof to an output signal of the correction circuit 120 i and then generating the result with a certain delay time.
