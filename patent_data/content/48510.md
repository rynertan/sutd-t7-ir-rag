# Cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
A cathode support in an electron gun of a cathode ray tube which comprises four substantially parallel lamellae 22, 24, 50, 30 which are connected together by means of an electrically insulating sealing glass 23 , of which a first metal lamella 22 engages a first electrode, for example, the anode 10 of the electron gun, second and third lamellae 24, 25 are situated substantially in one plane and are insulated electrically from each other, to which lamellae the cathode filament is connected electrically, and the cathode shaft 33 is suspended from a fourth lamella 30 , is very suitable for automated mass production of cathode ray tubes, for example television camera tubes, and enables a shorter cathode ray tube.
