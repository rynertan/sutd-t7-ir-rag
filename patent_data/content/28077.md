# Spindle rotation control system.

## Abstract
The system controls the speed of a motor 2 which drives spindle 5. A speed detector 3 detects actual speed AV of motor 2. A speed control circuit 1 can control the motor so as to make ac tual speed AV coincide with a commanded speed CV. An or ientation control circuit 4 provides a position deviation signal RPD on the basis of rotational spindle position and a com manded stopping position STP . When signal RPD is applied to speed control circuit 1 in place of commanded speed CV by means of changeover switch 10 the circuit 1 controls the mo tor so as to bring the spindle to rest at the commanded stop ping position STP . An in position signal generating circurt 143 generates an in position signal INPOS when the spindle reaches the vicinity of the commanded stopping position STP . In response to the INPOS signal the gain of speed control circuit 1 e.g., the gain of a phase compensation circuit 112 is increased to hold the spindle more rigidly in position.
