# Method of making aluminous abrasives.

## Abstract
A method of making sintered aluminous abrasive parti cles comprises mixing a quantity of uncalcined bauxite and sulphuric acid to dissolve the acid soluble portion thereof and form principally aluminium sulphate hydrate calcining the aluminium sulphate hydrate to separately form gamma alumina and sulphur trioxide forming the gamma alumina into an unfired body breaking the unfired body into granules and sintering the granules to convert the gamma alumina granules into sintered abrasive aluminous material of alpha alumina.
