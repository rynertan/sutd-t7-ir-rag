# Radiation image read out apparatus.

## Abstract
A radiation image read out apparatus comprises a source for emitting stimulating rays 2a for scanning a sti mulable phosphor sheet 10 carrying a radiation image stored therein, a photoelectric read out means 8 for de tecting light emitted by the stimulable phosphor sheet when it is scanned by stimulating rays, and a reflection mirror 14 positioned near a portion of the stimulable phosphor sheet where stimulating rays impinge thereupon for reflecting light 2b emitted by the stimulable phosphor sheet towards the photoelectric read out system. The reflection mirror is fab ricated to be moveable between a position at which the re flection mirror reflects light, which is emitted by the stimulable phosphor sheet, towards the photoelectric read out means and a position at which the reflection mirror does not reflect stimulating rays, which are reflected by the sti mulable phosphor sheet, towards the stimulable phosphor sheet.
