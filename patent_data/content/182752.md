# SYSTEM TO COUPLE CYLINDRICAL ELEMENTS TOGETHER FOR CONTAINERS

## Abstract
This invention concerns a system for coupling and assembling cylindrical elements which form OLSO thermal containers or the like, such coupling and assembly originat ing by the elements being screwed at their upper and lower ends to perimetric extensions having externally and intern ally threaded surfaces so as to divide and separate the vol umetric capacity into segments, internal partitions are screwed within the elements instead of coupling rings.
