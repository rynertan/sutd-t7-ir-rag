# Hydrotreating catalysts comprising a supported mixture of a sulfide of a promoter, metal, trivalent chromium and molybdenum or tungsten.

## Abstract
Supported, hydroprocessing catalysts comprising a sul fide of i trivalent chromium, ii Mo, W or mixture thereof and iii at least one metal selected from a Ni, Co, Mn, Cu, Zn, b a mixture thereof and c a mixture thereof with Fe. These catalysts are made by compositing a preselected quantity of support material with a precursor comprising a mixture of i hydrated oxide of trivalent chromium and ii a salt containing a thiometallate anion of MO or W and a cation comprising at least one divalent promoter metal chelated by at least one, neutral, nitrogen containing polydentate ligand and heating the composite in the presence of sulfur and hydrogen in an oxygen free atmosphere. These catalysts have been found to be useful hydrotreating catalysts having nitrogen removal activity superior to that of commercial catalysts such as sulfided cobalt molybdate on alumina.
