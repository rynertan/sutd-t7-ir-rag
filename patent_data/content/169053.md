# High frequency filter for electric instruments.

## Abstract
A high frequency filter for an electric instrument including a casing 10 of metallic conductive material, an internal elec tric circuit element 40 arranged within the casing, and a con nector 20 mounted on a peripheral wall of the casing for con necting the internal electric circuit element to an external elec tric circuit. The high frequency filter comprises an insulation substance layer 72 arranged between the connector and a connection terminal of the circuit element, the insulation sub stance layer being made of a dielectric material whose dielec tric constant decreases or increases in accordance with in crease or decrease of wireless frequency applied thereto, and a pair of conductive layers 73, 71 formed on opposite sur faces of the insulation substance layer, one 73 of the conduc tive layers being connected at one end thereof to the connector and at the other end thereof to the connection terminal of the circuit element, and the other conductive layer 71 being con nected to a portion of the casing.
