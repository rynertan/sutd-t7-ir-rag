## Description
The present invention relates to a tool transfer mechanism for machine tools in which a plurality of tools are stored in a storage magazine and are selectively transferred from the storage magazine to a tool spindle on a machine or vice versa. In general, in a vertical machine tool with an automatic tool changing apparatus, a spindle is vertically journalled to a spindle head. A plurality of tools are stored in a storage magazine with respective axes thereof being horizontally oriented. Therefore, in exchanging tools between the spindle and the storage magazine, a tool transfer mechanism has to change the posture of the tool from one where an axis of the tool is vertical to another where it is horizontal, or vice versa, during transfer of the tool. One example of such a tool transfer mechanism is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 22636 1983, wherein a tool holder which detachably carries a tool is shifted by the tool transfer mechanism between a gateway position of a tool storage magazine and a tool exchange position adjacent a spindle. The tool transfer mechanism has a fork which is attached to a middle portion of a cam shaft and is separably engageable with the tool holder. The cam shaft is rotatably connected to a piston rod of a hydraulic cylinder. A twisted grooved cam is axially formed on a periphery of the cam shaft and is engaged with a roller that is attached to a fixed frame, so that the cam shaft is rotated by a 90 angle in accordance with its axial movement. A swing plate which is rotatably mounted on the fixed frame is engaged with a spline portion of the cam shaft. A pair of guide bars are fixed to the swing plate to guide the tool holder while the same is being shifted by the fork. As a result, when the cam shaft is moved by the hydraulic cylinder to shift the tool holder between the gateway position and the exchange position, it is rotated by a 90 angle because of engagement of the grooved cam with the roller. The fork, the swing plate and the guide bars are simultaneously rotated so that a tool carried in the tool holder changes its posture between a horizontal one at the gateway position and a vertical one at the exchange position. However, in such tool transfer mechanism, insofar as the long guide bars are necessary to guide the tool holder, the tool transfer mechanism as a whole becomes cooperatively large and complex. A tool tranfer mechanism of the kind defined by the precharacterizing features of claim 1 is known from the US A 4 274 192. With this known transfer mechanism the gripping of a selected tool is achieved by movements of a paair of tool clamps. Therefore, the gripping mechanism is required to have a complicated synchronous mechanism before moving the pair of tool clamps in opposite directions simultaneously. Further, no means are provided for preventing the tool from falling down from the tool clamps during the tool transferring operation and posture changing operation, at least in the case that such operations are accomplished at a high speed. It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a tool transfer mechanism of the kind defined by the precharacterizing features of claim 1 which is compact in construction and which allows tool transferring operation to be accomplished at high speed in a save manner. This object is attend by the characterizing features of claims 1. Advantages developments of the invention are given by the subclaims. In the tool transferring mechanism according to the present invention, the gripping operation for gripping a selected tool socket is achieved by the movement of a single holding arm. Therefore, the gripping mechanism for gripping the tool socket can be constructed with a small number of parts. More specifically, the gripping mechanism is mainly constructed with only four parts, namely a base with an engaging portion, a holding arm, a resilient means and an abutment member. Therefore, the tool transfer mechanism according to the invention can constructed to be compact and simple. Further, in accordance with the invention, each of the tool sockets have a square cross section and the holding arm has a pair of side walls for accommodating the selected tool socket and at least one mating portion engaging with the selected tool socket to restrict movement of the selected tool socket in the direction parallel to the axis of the tool held in the selected tool socket. Therefore, the selected tool socket is surely held by the the holding arm without any fears that the tool socket will fall down from the holding arm during transfer and posture changing operation, thus enabling a high speed tool change operation. A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein Referring now to the drawings and to Figure 1 in particular, there is shown a bed 10 on which is mounted an upstanding column 11 so a to be slidable in a transverse direction. Feed movement of column 11 is controlled by a motor 14. A spindle head 12 is supported on a side surface of column 11 so as to be slidable in a vertical direction and is moved by a motor 17. A spindle 13 for removably holding a tool T is supported in spindle head 12 so as to be rotatable about a vertical axis and is driven by a conventional motor not shown . A table 15 is mounted on bed 10 so as to be slidable in a longitudinal direction, and is moved by a motor 19. A workpiece W which is fixedly positioned on table 15 is machined by the tool T held on spindle 13 in accordance with relative movement of column 11, spindle head 12 and table 15. A tool storage magazine 16 for storing tools T which are to be held on spindle 13 is secured on bed 10. A tool transfer mechanism 40 according to the present invention and a conventional tool change arm 20 are located between tool storage magazine 16 and spindle 13. Tool transfer mechanism 40 serves to transfer tool T between a gateway position P1 of tool storage magazine 16 and an exchange position P2 adjacent spindle 13, with a change in posture of tool T transferred thus occurring between a horizontal posture at gateway position P1 and a vertical posture at exchange position P2. Tool change arm 20 is designed to exchange tool T transferred to exchange position P2 by tool transfer mechanism 40 and tool T held in spindle 13. Referring now to Figure 2, tool storage magazine 16 has a support frame 21 which is upstandingly fixed to bed 10. A sprocket wheel 18 is rotatably mounted on an upper portion of support frame 21 and a guide rail 22 is attached to a lower portion of support frame 21. An endless chain 23 is wound round sprocket wheel 18 in meshing engagement therewith and is also wound round guide rail 22. Sprocket wheel 18 is in driven connection with a motor not shown through a conventional gearing such as worm gearing. As shown in Figure 3, socket holders 24 are secured to chain 23 at regular intervals and with detachably support tool sockets 25, respectively. Accordingly, when chain 23 is rotationally indexed by the motor not shown , a desired socket of said tool sockets 25 is shifted to gateway position P1. Each tool socket 25 has respective engagement recesses 26 on opposite sides thereof as shown in Figure 5. Socket holder 24 is provided with first and second projections which are respectively engaged with engagement recesses 26. Guide rails 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 Figure 2 are secured to support frame 21 so as to guide each outside portion of tool socket 25 so that tool socket 25 is continuously held on socket holder 24. However, an opening is provided between guide rails 30, 34 at gateway position P1 so that tool socket 25 may be removed outwardly from socket holder 24. Tool T is inserted into a tapered bore 27 of tool socket 25 and is detachably maintained therein in a conventional manner, that is, a pull stud of tool T is engaged with a detent which is biased by a spring toward the pull stud. Referring now to Figures 3 and 4, a tool transfer mechanism 40 according to the present invention has a guide sleeve 41 that is attached to supported frame 21. Reference numeral 42 designates a shaft which is slidably fitted with guide sleeve 41. An actuator for moving shaft 42 is axially provided, that is, shaft 42 is rotatably connected to a piston rod of a hydraulic cylinder 45 which is fixed to support frame 21. A twisted grooved cam 43 is axially formed on a periphery of shaft 42 and is engaged with a follower, such as a roller 44, that is attached to guide sleeve 41, so that shaft 42 is rotated through a 90 angle when shaft 42 is axially moved by hydraulic cylinder 45. A base 47 is fixedly mounted on a front end of shaft 42. A pair of support jaws 48 are formed on base 47, leaving a space therebetween, so that a rear portion of tool socket 25 is allowed to pass therebetween. Therefore, when base 47 is positioned at gateway position P1, a desired tool socket 25 is indexable between jaws 48 in accordance with indexing movement of Claim 23. Tool socket 25 is also prevented from being separated from socket holder 24 by jaws 48. A holding arm 51 is pivotally mounted on base 47 by means of pin 50. Holding arm 51 has side walls to accommodate the outside portion of tool socket 25 when arm 51 is swung toward tool socket 25. The side walls of holding arm 51 are respectively provided with engaging notches 53 which are engageable with stubs 54 which project from respective sides of tool socket 25. A tool engaging contact member 60 is positioned as shown in Figure 3 and which includes a plunger 62 slidably mounted on base 47 wherein plunger 62 is biased by a spring 61 toward a rear end portion of holding arm 51. Accordingly, holding arm 51 is resiliently pivotable so that engaging notches 53 thereof engage with stubs 54 to hold tool sockets 25 on base 47. When base 47 is arranged as shown in Figure 3 holding arm 51 abuts an abutment 63 which is fixed to support frame 21, so that holding arm 51 is swung outwardly to be positioned away from tool socket 25. The length of abutment 63 is so arranged that engaging notches 53 engage with stubs 54 before tool socket 25 is separated from the front and second projections of socket holder 24 upon the rightward or forward movement of base 47. The operation of the tool transfer mechanism 40 as constructed above will now be described. While the workpiece W is machined by tool T held on spindle 13, endless chain 23 is indexed to position at gateway position P1 a tool T which is to be next used and which is oriented such that its longitudinal axis is parallel to remaining tools in the tool storage magazine 16. At this time base 47 is oriented as shown in Figure 3 and holding arm 51 is thus positioned so as to be pivoted outwardly due to abutting engagement with abutment 63 so that tool sockets 25 held in tool storage magazine 16 may pass by or between jaws 48 without interferring with holding arm 51 during indexing movement of endless chain 23. Upon completion of a machining operation by a tool T located on spindle 13, a tool change command is generated from a numerical control device not shown . According to the tool change command, spindle head 12 is moved upward to a tool change position and column 11 is moved to a tool change position. At the same time base 47 is moved to the right in Figure 3 by cylinder 45. According to such rightward movement of base 47, tool socket 25 which is located at gateway position P1 is removed from socket holder 24 by being engaged by jaw 48, and is held on base 47 by engagement of notches 53 with stubs 54. When base 47 and shaft 42 is further moved rightward by cylinder 45, shaft 42 together with base 47 are rotated through a 90 angle because of cooperation of twisted groove cam 43 with roller 44. Accordingly tool socket 25 which is held on base 47 is rotated to change the posture of tool T that is inserted in tapered bore 27 of tool socket 25 from a horizontal posture at gateway position P1 to a vertical posture at exchange position P2 so that the longitudinal axis of tool T is parallel to that of spindle 13. When base 47 is forwarded to exchange position P2, a tool change arm 20 is rotated to simultaneously grasp tools T, T which are respectively held in tool socket 25 and in spindle 13. Thereafter tool change arm 20 is moved downward to pull such tools T, T out from tool socket 25 and out from spindle 13 and is rotated through a 180 angle to thus exchange the position of tools T, T. Tool change arm 20 is then shifted upward to insert the exchanged tools in tool socket 25 and spindle 13, releases such tools T, T and finally is rotated to a neutral position. Upon completion of changing of tools T, T spindle head 12 is moved downward and column 11 is forwarded to machine workpiece W with new tool T. Concurrently base 47 is moved backward by cylinder 45, and accordingly tool socket 25 which holds previously used tool T is reversely rotated through a 90 angle upon cooperation of cam 43 with roller 44, so that the posture of tool T is changed from vertical to horizontal. When base 47 is located at gateway position P1, recesses 26 of tool socket 25 are engaged with projections of socket holder 24, and holding arm 51 abuts with abutment 63 so to be pivoted outwardly upon disengagement of notches 53 from stubs 54. Subsequently tool storage magazine 16 indexes tool socket 25 which positions the next tool T at gateway position P1. Although in the above described embodiments, shaft 42 together with base 47 is rotated by cam 43 and roller 44 mechanism, the same effect as in the above described embodiments can be obtained in the case where a pinion is attached to shaft 42 and a rack which is reciprocated by a cylinder is engaged with the pinion. Furthermore, should it be required, tool T might be solely transferred by the tool transfer mechanism without being held in tool socket 25. Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.
