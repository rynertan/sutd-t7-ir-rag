# Liquid projecting monitor.

## Abstract
A liquid projecting monitor of the spherical head type has its head 1 sealing against a housing 2 which defines together with the head a chamber 8 from which liquid is lead into a passage 10 in the head 1 and thence to a nozzle coupled to the head 1 at athreaded socket 14 . The head 1 is borne by an axle 18 for pivotal movement relative to the housing 2 so as to adjust the angular elevation or depression of the nozzle. A centre body 16 extends transversely across the interior of the head 1 to enclose the axle 18 and is so shaped, together with the internal surface 23 of the head 1 , that the cross sectional area of the passage 10 available for liquid flow is maintained at least approximately constant throughout its length, so as to minimise the pressure drop in the liquid flow which passes through the head 1 .
