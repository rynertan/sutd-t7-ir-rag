## Description
Semiconductor device manufacturing method This invention relates to a semiconductor device manufacturing method and more particularly to a method for manufacturing an anode emitter shorting type gate turn off thyristors AN GTO . The structure of an already known AN GTO will be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 shows a top view of an AN GTO. Fig. 2 shows a cross sectional view taken on line I I of Fig. 1. In manufacturing the AN GTO, for example, an n type semiconductor substrate 12 is prepared. This AN GTO includes p type region 14 formed in the upper surface of substrate 12, and p type region 16 formed in the bottom surface of substrate 12. The p type region 16 is used as the anodeemitter of the AN GTO. The cathode emitter of the ANGTO is composed of radially distributed n type regions 18, as shown in the Fig. 1. n type regions 18 are obtained by patterning an n type region not shown which is formed on the entire surface of p type region 16.The AN GTO includes n type regions 20 in the bottom surface of the n type substrate. The regions 20 serves as shorting sections. The n type regions 20, as shown in Fig. 2, are located under the bottom of n type regions 18. Anode electrode 22 of the AN GTO is formed in contact with n type regions 20 and p type region 16.Cathode electrodes 24 are formed in contact with n type regions 18. Gate electrodes 25 are formed in contact with p type region 14. Figs. 3A and 3B shows manufacturing steps for theAN GTO. In step of Fig. 3A, oxide film 26 is formed on the entire surface of n type substrate 12. Oxide film 26 is patterned on the bottom surface of substrate 12, as shown in Fig. 3B. The n type regions 20A through 20C are formed, following the patterning process, by diffusing impurity into the substrate 12 with the mask of the remaining oxide film 26. During the manufacturing of the devices, however, pin hole defects, for example, may occur in oxide film 26 at points indicated by wXN in Fig. 3, from a variety of causes. In this case, oxide film 26 cannot fulfill its role as a diffusion protecting film, in the forming process of n type regions 20. This is because the impurities will pass through the pin holes and diffuse into substrate 12, thus forming unnecessary n type regions. In the succeeding steps of forming p type region 14, n type regions 18, and the like, the unnecessary n type regions will be thermally diffused to grow to the size of n type regions 28A and 28B, as shown in Fig. 4. n type regions 28A and 28B will deteriorate the forward blocking voltage characteristic of the AN GTO. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device with excellent forward blocking voltage characteristic at a high production yield. According to this invention, there is provided a semiconductor device manufacturing method comprising a first step of preparing a semiconductor substrate of a first conductivity type having first and second surfaces, a second step of forming an oxide film pattern on the first surface of the semiconductor substrate, a third step of forming a first region of the first conductivity type in the first surface of the semiconductor substrate by using a mask of the oxide film pattern, with a higher impurity concentration than the semiconductor substrate, and a fourth step of forming a second region of a second conductivity type in the first surface of the semiconductor substrate with a depth shallower than the first region, after removal of the oxide film pattern, and forming a third region of the second conductivity type in the second surface of the semiconductor substrate, characterized by further comprising a fifth step of removing a part of the semiconductor substrate on the second surface side by a predetermined thickness, before formation of the third region 38B . With the above manufacturing method, even if an unnecessary region of the first conductivity type is formed in the second surface of the semiconductor substrate in the third step, this region formed is reliably removed in the fifth step. Therefore, the forward blocking voltage characteristic of the produced device is prevented from deterioration caused by the growth of such a region. This fact greatly contributes to improvement of the yield of production of semiconductor devices. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a top view of the known AN GTO Fig. 2 shows a partial cross sectional view taken along line I I shown in Fig. 1 Figs. 3A and 3B show manufacturing steps of theAN GTO according to a conventional manufacturing method Fig. 4 shows a defective AN GTO having unnecessary semiconductor regions as manufactured according to the conventional manufacturing method and Figs. 5A to 5J illustrate manufacturing steps of anAN GTO according to an embodiment of this invention. A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of this invention will be described referring to Figs. 5A through 5J. These figures illustrate steps for manufacturing an anode shorting type gate turn off thyristor AN GTO . In a first step, n type substrate 30 containing n type impurity at a low concentration is prepared. Oxide film 32 is formed on the substrate 30 with a uniform thickness and covers the entire surface of substrate 30, as shown in Fig. 5A. After this, resist pattern 34 is formed on oxide film 32 over the bottom surface of substrate 30, as shown in Fig. 5B. Oxide film 26 is subjected to an etching process with a use of resist pattern 34 as a mask. In this process, oxide film 26 is completely removed from the upper surface of substrate 30, and partially removed from the bottom surface, oxide film pattern 34 being left on the bottom surface of substrate 30, as shown inFig. 5C. Then, n type impurity, such as phosphorus, is doped in the exposed surface of semiconductor substrate 30, using oxide film pattern 34 as a mask. During the doping process, n type diffusion regions 36A and 36B with high impurity concentration are formed in the bottom and top surfaces of substrate 30. Subsequently, substrate 30 is subjected to the lapping process.Through this lapping process, the upper surface area of substrate 30 is lapped away by a predetermined thicknessD. The thickness D is so selected to be greater than the depth of diffusion region 36B, as shown in Fig. SE, in order to completely remove diffusion region 36B from semiconductor substrate 30. The step of Fig. 5E may includes an etching process or etching lapping process instead of the lapping process. After removal of oxide film pattern 32A, the p type impurity such as galium is doped into the substrate 30.By this doping process, p type diffusion regions 38A and 38B are respectively formed in the bottom and top surfaces of substrate 30, as shown in Fig. 5F. In this case, the amount of doping impurity and the doping time are selected to a value at which the conductivity type of the diffusion regions 36A is not inverted. During this doping, regions 36A grow as shown in Fig. 5F, due to the thermal diffusion of impurities. Diffusion region 38A is formed shallower than diffusion regions 36A as grown in order to use the regions 36A as the anode shorting regions. Following the formation of diffusion region 38B, n type impurity is doped in the top surface of the semiconductor substrate to form n type diffusion region 40 with a uniform thickness, as shown inFig. 5G. As shown in Fig. 5H, resist pattern 42 is applied to the top of diffusion region 40, and selectively masks region 40 corresponding to the positions of diffusion regions 36A. After this, an etching process is performed, using the resist pattern 42 as a mask. As shown in Fig. SI, portions of diffusion regions 40 and 38B are selectively removed through the process. The remaining diffusion regions 40A through 40D are used as the cathode emitter of the AN GTO. Then, as shown in Fig. 5J, cathode electrodes 44 are formed in ohmic contact with diffusion regions 40A through 40D, gate electrodes 48 are formed in contact with diffusion region 38B, and anode electrodes 46 are formed in ohmic contact with diffusion regions 38A and 36A. According to the manufacturing method of the abovementioned embodiment, an unnecessary diffusion region 36B is formed by the process of Fig. 5D, but this region has been completely removed before diffusion region 38B is formed. Even if heat is applied to the semiconductor structure in the steps succeeding to the step of Fig. 5F, a shorting portion will not be formed on the cathode side of the AN GTO. Also, even in case diffusion region 36B is not completely removed, as long as region 36B grows in diffusion region 38B, the deterioration of a forward blocking electrical characteristic of the AN GTO will be prevented. According to this embodiment, it is not necessary to leave oxide film 32 on the top surface of semiconductor substrate 30 in the etching process of the oxide film 32. On the other hand, in the conventional manufacturing method, in order for oxide film 32 to perform its role as a diffusion protective film on the top surface of semiconductor substrate 30, a resist film must be applied beforehand to the top of the protective film, so that it will not be removed by the etching process.
