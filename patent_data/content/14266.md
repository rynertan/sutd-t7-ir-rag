## Description
Improvements in and relating to electrically driven wheel chairs The invention relates to a vehicle, particularly a wheel chair, driven by an electromotor which is powered by a supply of direct current, said vehicle being provided with a motor contra circuit to keep the speed of the motor at a chosen adjusted value by the steps of producing a signal which is representative of the speed, comparing the signal with the adjusted speed value and controlling, in dependence on the measured difference, the mean value of the current supplied to the motor. The signal representative of the speed may be obtained by the use of a tacho sensor coupled to the motor shaft and generating an alternating current voltage having a frequency which is directly proportional to the speed of the motor.To that end either a special motor provided with a tacho sensor or a tacho sensor separately mounted on the shaft of a conventional motor must be used. Both possibilities are expensive. A complication is formed by the fact that the frequency of the output signal of the tacho sensor must be converted into a suitable regulating signal. The invention has for its object to avoid the cited disadvantages and this is achieved in that the signal which is representative of the speed of the motor is a voltage derived from the current flowing through the motor. Then a conventional motor can be used, in which the speed of the motor is connected with the current flowing through the motor. An optimally operating regulation is obtained, when the control circuit has such a back coupling as to ensure that its output impedance is of the same magnitude, although in the negative sense, as the inner impedance of the motor. This can be realized in that inserted in the control circuit is an amplifier, the output of which is positively back coupled by voltage by means of a first back coupling circuit and is negatively back coupled by current by means of a second back coupling circuit. For that purpose the motor may be connected to the output of the amplifier through a resistance and the second back coupling circuit may be connected to the junction point between the motor and said resistance. In order to obtain a sufficiently high torque at low speeds the motor may be powered by current pulses, of which the periods are variable.To that end the input voltage of the control circuit may be a fixed alternating current voltage which is superposed on an adjustable direct current voltage. In a wheel chair for disabled persons the current flowing through the motor will be automatically increased when the speed is in danger of falling below the desired adjusted speed, so that a greater torque is produced to overcome the resistance affecting the speed in negative sense.This is possible without the invalid person having to operate the speed adjusting knob. An example thereof is running over a threshold. When the wheelchair has not been equiped with the circuit according to the invention the user has to readjust the speed knob in upward sense when such a resistance is met.The result thereof is, that after the resistance has been overcome, the wheel chair darts forward, which not only indoors, but also in the public highway is dangerous. The invention will be elucidated with the aid of the drawing. It shows a diagrammatic view of an embodiment of a control circuit according to the invention, to which a motor is connected. The circuit includes an amplifier 1 with a very great voltage amplification. The input signal u1 comes from the output of an analogical addition and deduction circuit 2. To the latter an input voltage u2 is supplied which corresponds wit an adjusted desired speed. The output of the amplifier 1 produces through the impedance 3 the current flowing through the motor 4. Connected to the point between the output of the amplifier and the impedance 3 is the input terminal of ar attenuating and integrating circuit 5 which consists of two resistances 6 and 7 and a capacitor 8, the output of which is connected with an addition input of the addition and deduction circuit 2.The circuit 5 has, except for an attenuating function, a moderating function, whereby its output voltage u3 is the attenuated time average of the output voltage U4 of the amplifier 1. Connected to the point between the impedance 3 and the motor 4 is the input terminal of an attenuating and integrating circuit 9 which consists of two resistances 10 and 11 and a capacitor 12, the output of which is connected with an deduction input of the addition and deduction circuit 2. The circuit 9 has, except for an attenuating function, a moderating function, whereby its output voltage u5 is the attenuated time average of its input voltage u6. In this way a positive voltage back coupling and a negative current back coupling are obtained. When the dimensioning is correct this composite back coupling produces an output impedance of the motor control circuit which has the same magnitude as the inner impedance of the motor but is negative. When an input voltage u2 is used which consists of a fixed alternating current voltage superposed on an adjustable direct current voltage the described circuit produces a motor supply which is constituted by current pulses of variable time period and constant amplitude. The described input voltage can easily be obtained by means of an alternator generating an output voltage of which the frequency and the wave form are not critical and by means of an adjustable direct current voltage to be added to said alternating current voltage.
