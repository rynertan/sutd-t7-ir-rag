## Description
RETAINER DEVICE FOR REAR SEAT DROP BACKS OP PASSENGE CARS This invention relates to a retainer device for rear seat drop backs of passenger care. As is known, modern passenger cars, and especially passenger cars of the so called two volume type, have a rear seat which is provided with a tilt down or drop back serving, in the tilted down position, as load plane so as to increase the capacity of the luggage compartment. The rear seat drop backs for passenger cars of that type are provided with retainer devices which ensure their stability when used as rear seat backs.Such retainer devices are to meet the dual and conflicting requirements of strength, to prevent the back from coming loose and tilting over as the passenger car is sharply decelerated, and of simplicity both in construction and operation. However nowadays no retainer devices are available, which meet both requirements in a satisfactory degree. Therefore the aim of the present invention is to solve the explained problem. This invention achieves this aim by means of a retainer device for rear seat drop backs of passenger cars, characterized in that it comprises a box type container, having a front opening and accommodating a swingable lever with a lobated body which carries a seat adapted to receive by snap action the end of a fixed hooking pin, said device further comprising a disengagement hairpin spring loaded by said fixed pin on completion of the hooking operation when the lever seat is urged to engage with the pin and acting on said fixed pin to eject it from said box like container upon actuation of said lever. According to the invention, moreover, in order to allow the pin to be engaged irreversibly, the seat therefor, provided on the lever, has its inlet end positioned parallel to path segment lying tangent to the pin and the lobated body of the lever blocks the front opening of the box type container and is so profiled as to bring about the snap action swinging movement of the lever upon forcing the seat back into the hooked position and the hooking pin being passed through said front opening. Owing to the pin seat engagement being made irreversible, release can only occur by swinging the lever manually against the bias force of a return spring. The invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description and with reference to the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is a perspective view showing a portion of a rear seat drop back incorporating the device of this invention Figure 2 is a detailed elevation view of the device Figure 3 is a front view of the device and Figure 4 is a sectional view taken along the line IV IV of Figure 3. In the drawings, the numeral 10 designates the rear seat drop back of a passenger car as indicated, and 20 the device according to the invention. For the purpose of holding the seat back in the upright position, the device 20 is engaged with the free end of a hooking pin 11 connected rigidly to the car body load bearing structure. The device 20 comprises essentially a box type container formed of two Juxtaposed shells 21 22 of a polymeric material, which are irremovably connected by a tern of riveted pins 23 24 25 serving, in addition to the connecting function, other functions to be explained herein below. Mounted on the pin 24 which may be also made integral with the material of the shells is, in fact, a freely pivotable lever 26 having a lobated body 27 and a handgrip 28 coming out of the box type container by a convenient length. In the lobated body 27, there is formed a semicircular seat 29 which opens downward as viewed in Figures 2 and 4 the opening being, therefore, parallel to and substantially coincident with the path segment which lies tangent to the pin 11.Furthermore, the lobated body 27 is formed with a forward profile 27a adapted to be engaged by the pin 11 to produce a snap action swinging movement of the lever upon forcing the seat back 10 into the hooked position. In the body 27 of the lever, there is also formed a slot 30 having the shape of an arc of a circle, wherein the pin 23 engages to stop the oscillation of the lever 26. That oscillation is resisted by a hairpin spring 31 having a portion wound around the pin 24 and an end 31b in engagement with the lever 26, forcing it elastically into the closed position. In this position, shown in the figures with continuous line, the surface 27a of the lobated body 27 protrudes in a front opening 32 provided in the box type container and being intended to allow the pin 11 therethrough.Furthermore, in the closed position, the seat 29 engages with said pin to prevent self disengagement by virtue of the seat being substantially aligned to the pivot axis of the lever 26 and having as mentionedZ its opening directed downwards. Another portion of the hairpin 31 is wound around the pin 25 and has an end 31a protruding out of the front opening 32 laterally of the lever seat 29. The end 31a of the spring is bent to an arc of a circle with the same curvature as the pin 11 which engages and loads the end 31a on the pin being pushed into the hooked position in the front opening 32. Thanks to the profile 27a of the lever lobated body 27, the pin 11 is engaged into the lever seat 29 with a snap action. By moving the lever in the direction allowed for by the pin 23 clockwise as viewed in Figure 2 the pin is disengaged and is urged out by the end 31a of the spring as loaded during the hooking phase.
