# Three stage intracranial pressure relief valve having single piece valve stem.

## Abstract
An implantable valve for allowing the passage of cere brospinal fluid CSF from a ventricle of the brain to a suitable drainage location in the body includes a movable diaphragm 45 , one side of which is in pressure communication with the drainage location of the body and the other side of which is in pressure communication with the ventricular spaces of the brain. A valve assembly, actuable by displacement of the dia phragm in response to applied pressure differentials, regulates passage of CSF from the ventricular spaces to the drainage lo cation. When the pressure differential is relatively small, the valve operates in a constant pressure mode to maintain a predetermined pressure differential across the valve. In re sponse to a sudden increase in differential pressure, the valve mechanism operates in a constant flow mode to maintain a de sired relatively constant CSF flow rate through the valve. Above a predetermined pressure differential, the valve oper ates in a constant pressure mode to maintain a predetermined maximum pressure differential across the valve. To simplify construction, the valve includes a single piece valve stem 68 having a ramp surface 72 at one end and a fluid restrictor sur face 73 at the other end which cooperate with the valve dia phragm to provide the three operating modes.
