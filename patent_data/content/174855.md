# HORIZONTAL MOULD CASTING

## Abstract
A horizontal casting technique and mould for use specifically with shell moulds and runner feeder sections. The runner feeder sections are assembled within the shell moulds such that the ends of the runner feeder section protrude from the mould and can be flow connected to a runner feeder of an adjacent assembly. A plurality of these assemblies constitute the horizontal mould having a horizon tal runner feeder and a plurality of shell moulds in spaced side by side relationship.
