# Helicopter destruction system employing cables.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for destroying helicopters is disclosed and relies on launching cables 7 above a heli copter 1 which cables 7 are tailored to a specific heli copter to maximize the probability of ingestion of the cable into the helicopter rotor system 3, 5 thus providing a low cost, highly efficient helicopter destruction system.
