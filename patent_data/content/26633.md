# Opposed piston machinery.

## Abstract
An opposed piston compressor has a rigid yoke 3 which interconnects two detachable pistons 7. The cage like yoke accommodates the crankshaft 1, balance weights 2, and a single connecting rod 8 hinged to the yoke. This construction enables the shaft bearings 9 to be placed close to the centre line of the pistons 7 , and allows easy replacement of the pistons 7 .
