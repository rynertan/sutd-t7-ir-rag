# Gas monitoring method and device.

## Abstract
A method and device for monitoring and compensating for air inleakage and oxygen content in a steam generator system which has a condenser. The method includes the steps of 1 monitoring air flowing in the exhaust system of the condenser at a chosen monitoring location 2 detemining the total gas flow rate and the oxygen content thereof 3 injecting a pulse of oxygen into the upstream of the exhaust system and measuring the transit time to the monitoring location 4 based on this data, determining actual air inleakage rates 5 if the actual, monitored rates are higher than the allowable rates, isolating and eliminating the air inleakage and introducing knwon amounts of oxygen scavenger to control the oxygen content or, if the actual, moni tored rates are too low, introducing less oxygen scavenger. The device includes a high temperature, solid electrolyte cell O₂ sensor for both total gas flow and O₂ measurements.
