# Circular knitting machine of the cylinder and dial type, in particular for knitting hosiery.

## Abstract
A circular knitting machine, in particular for knitting hosiery, is disclosed, wherein the dial 16 is rotated by the needle cylinder 3 through a rod 24 extending coaxially with the cylinder 3 and dial 16 and rotatively connected to the latter. The rod 24 can be shifted axially from a position of engagement with a drive element 33 rigid with the cylinder 3 , to a position of disengagement therefrom, and viceversa. In the former condition, the dial 16 will be rotated in timed reletionship with the cylinder 3 , whereby the fabric 35 is knitted normally, whereas in the latter condition, the knitted fabric 35 is discharged. The rod 24 axial movement may be obtained by a pneumatically or hydraulically operated cylinder 28 , whose piston is rotatably connected to the rod 24 itself. It is further possible to make the dial 16 raisable vertically through a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder 12 , such as to make the loop formation area fully accessible.
