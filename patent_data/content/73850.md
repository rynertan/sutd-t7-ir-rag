## Description
Dental Prosthesis AdhesiveThe invention relates to a dental prosthesis adhesive containing one or more adhesive substances as well as a process for producing a dental prosthesis adhesive.It is generally known to produce dental prosthesis adhesives using chemical or natural substances imparting an adhesive action and which are used individually, mixed with one another or distributed in carrier substances. These dental prosthesis adhesives give a natural prosthesis fit, which generally lasts several hours.However, in general, a maximum duration of the adhesive action is desired which should last over a maximum day period of up to 17 or more hours. Of all known adhesives eventually one would possibly expect such a long adhesive action over the day, but it would be very difficult for the prosthesis wearer to remove the denture during the period in question whenever he would wish to do so because the adhesive action is extremely powerful. It is also extremely difficult to clean such adhesives from the dental prosthesis.Thus, the problem of the invention is to provide a dental prosthesis adhesive permitting a reliable fit over long periods, whilst stillmasing it possible to remove the prosthesis without difficulty.According to the invention, this problem is solved in that the adhesive substance or substances are at least partly provided with a coating which slowly dissolves in the saliva and or in ingestive liquids.The process of the invention for producing such a dental prostesis aid is characterized by coating the adhesive substance or substances with a coating which slowly dissolves in the salvia and or in ingestive liquids and mining the coated adhesive substance or substances with coated adhesive substance or substances.Accordingly, the invention teaches to treat adhesive substances which ensure a reliable hold of up to 8 hours and more and which do not impair the removal of the denture in a manner providing a delaying action. Unlike the disadvantageous prior art prosthesis adhesives in which all the adhesive substances are simultaneously used in the active state, in the dental prosthesis adhesive according to the invention the release of the adhesion imparting substances takes place in time controlled manner, in that in part the adhesion imparting substances are provided with a coating which slowly dissolves in the saliva and or in ingestive liquids and when dissolved releases unoonswd adhesive and cones into action after the consumption or release or washing away of the already consumed adhesive.The adhesive substances can be chemically defined compounds, for example sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,Karaya gum, guar gum, tragacanth, polyethylene oxide polymers copolymers of maleic anhydride with lower alkylvinylether and mixed partial salts thereof polyacrylamide and the like, mixtures thereof, natural substances or mixtures thereof or also mixtures with chemical substances. Optionally the denture adhesive composition may contain flavours, colorants, preservatives, fillers and other common denture adhesive additives.The dental prosthesis adhesive according to the invention is produced by coating part of the adhesive substances with a varyingly thick protective film, and saliva or ingested liquids successively release the adhesive by dissolving the coating. The coating on the adhesive particles can be formed by the most varied substances such as e.g. ethyl cellulose, saccarose monostearate, gum arabic, cellulose acetate phthalate, acrylates, methycrylate, shellac and other film formers. The coating agent, which is e.g. used as a film, can be formed by substances which are insoluble or sparingly soluble in water, their sparing solubility only occurring within specific pH ranges.Conventionally, between approximately 10 and 90 of the adhesive substances are coated, coating taking place e.g. by spraying adhesive substance particles with the film former dissolved in a solvent.Conventionally, between approximately 10 and 90 of the adhesive substances used are coated and initially the uncoated portion brings about the adhesion of the prosthesis. After washing out this uncoated portion, the remaining adhesive is slowly released after a time which can be predetermined by the choice of coating the thickness thereof, so that a much longer overall adhesive period can be achieved than would be possible with the uncoated adhesive. As a result of the process according to the invention, the conventional adhesion time can be extended by several additional hours. However, no difficulties are encountered if it is possibly necessary in the meantime to remove the prosthesis, because the adhesion of the adhesive is always the same as with normal adhesives being effective for shorter periods.In addition, no difficulties are encountered in cleaning the prosthesis because the conventional, easily removable prosthesis adhesives can be used.Further features and advantages of the invention can be gathered from the claims and the following description of performance examples.Example 1Preparation of adhesive powder 150 kg sodium carboxymethyl cellulose particle size max. 0.6 mm are sprayed in a fluidized bed procedure fluidized bed drier like AEROMATIC or GLATT with 120 kg of a 6.5 methacrylate isopropanol solution, resulting in a coating with a thickness of 2 5 micrometer. Spraying and drying are conducted in one step according to the conventional fluidized bed procedure. The yield is about 160 kg sodium carboxymethyl cellulose coated by a film.40 parts by weight of the coated sodium carboxymethyl cellulose are well mixed with 60 parts by weight of non coated sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. The resulting pulverulent mixture can be used as an adhesive powder for dental prosthesis with a considerabLy longer adhesion period than conventional similar adhesives.Example 2Preparation of a semifluid dental prosthesis adhesiveAn adhesive powder prepared in the manner described in example 1 is incorporated into a semifluid carrier constituted by a mixture of paraffin and glycol or polyethyleneglycol and glycerol. The resulting highly viscous liquid imparts good adhesion to a dental prosthesis for a longer period than the conventional similar adhesives. Example 3Preparation of a prosthesis adhesive powder 150 kg sodium carboxylmethyl cellulose particle size max. 0.6 mm are sprayed in a fluidized bed procedure fluidized bed drier like AEROMATIC or GLATT with 60 kg of a 6.5 ethylalcoholic ethylcellulose solution, resulting in a coating with a thickness of 2 5 micrometer. Spraying and drying are conducted in one step according to the conventional fluidized bed procedure. The yield is about 160 kgNaCMC, the particles thereof being coated with an ethylcellulose film. 50 parts by weight of the coated NaCMC sodium carboxymethyl cellulose are well mixed with 50 parts by weight of uncoated sodium carboxymethyl cellulose.The resultant powder can be used as an adhesive powder for dental prosthesis having a longer effective period than conventional similar adhesives.Example 4Preparation of a dental prosthesis creamThe adhesive powder mixture described in example 3 is incorporated into a creamy carrier formed from petrolatum and liquid petrolatum and paraffin oil. The adhesive cream provides a satisfactory adhesive action for a longer period, when applied to a dental prosthesis, than conventional similar adhesives.Further, suitable flavorants, such as peppermint oi, or the like can be added to the denture adhesive compositions to improve the taste.
