# Flexible magnetic disk drive machine.

## Abstract
A drive machine is described for magnetic diskettes of the type including a flexible disk rotatably disposed in a jacket having aligned radial slots in the two thicknes ses of the jacket. The machine includes a pair of trans ducers 28, 30 fixed to a carriage 26 and extending through one of the slots into contact with one side of the disk 48 and a pair of backup pads 36, 38 on the other side of the disk respectively opposite the transducers and mounted by on swing arms 94, 96 hinged to the frame of the machine. A motor driven cam plate 32 with a spiral groove and a follower 114 therein are used for moving the transducer carriage 26 radially on the disk for reg istry with different magnetic tracks thereon, and the cam plate has a peripheral portion 120 that moves the swing arms to disengage the pads from the disk at outermost magnetic tracks of the transducers. The disk is clamped between a rotatable drive spindle 24 and a collet 40 , and the collet is carried on a further swing arm 112 hinged to the machine frame. Interconnections are provided be tween the swing arms so that when the collet is moved out of engagement with the spindle the pads are also moved out of engagement with the disk.
