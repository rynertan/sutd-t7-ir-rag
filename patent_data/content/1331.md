They inueusts, granules, pellets, solutions, emulsions, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few pints to several hundred gallons per acre. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation.The formulations, broadly, contain about 1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 5 to 99 solid or liquid diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Percent by height Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Emulsions, Solutions including Emulsifiable Concentrates 5 50 40 95 0 15Dusts 1 25 70 9,9 Ow5 Granules and Pellets 1 95 5 99 0 15High Strength Compositions 90 99 0 10 0 2 Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound.Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd. Edn., Dorland Books, Caldwell, N.Y. The denser diluents are preferred for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, SolventsGuide , 2nd. Edn., Interscience, New York, 1950. Solu tion concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents andEmulsifiers Annual , Allured Publ. Corp., Ridgwood, NewJersey, as well as Sisal and Wood, Encyclopedia ofSurface Active Agents , Chemical Publ. Co., Inc. NewYork, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or b agglomeration techniques. See J.

They can be used for the selective control of weeds in crops, such 25 cotton, soybeans and sugarbeets, or wherever general weed control is required, such as on industrial sites, railroad rights of way and locations adjacent to crop lands. The precise amount of the compounds of the present invention to be used in any given situation will vary according to the particular end result desired, the use involved, the plant and soil involved, the formula tion used, the mode of application, prevailing weather conditions, foliage density and like factors. Since so many variables play a role, it is not possible to state a rate of application suitable for all situations.Broadly speaking, the compounds of the invention are used at levels of about O.06 to about 15 kilograms per hectare. The lower rates in this range will generally be selected for selective weed control in crops, on lighter soils, soils low in organic matter content, or in situations where maximum persistence is not necessary.In many situations it is advantageous to incorporate these chemicals with the soil. The following compounds may be used in combination with the compounds of the instant invention 5 amino 4 chloro 2 phenyl 3 2H pyridazinone Pyrazon 2 chloro 4,6 bis ethylamino s triazine Simazine 2 chloro 4 tethylamino 6 isopropylamino s triazine Atrazne 2 chloro 4,6 bis isopropylamino s triazine Propazine 2 4 chloro 6 ethylaamino s .riazin 2 ylasmino 2 methylproprionitrile Cyanazine 4 amino 6 1,1 aimethylethyl 3 methylthio 1,2,4 triazin 5 4H one Metribuzin 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl 1,1 dimethylurea Diuron 3 p E chlorophenoxy phenyl 1,1 dimethylurea Chloroxuron 1,1 dimethyl 3 a, , trifluoro m tolyl urea Fluormeturon 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl 1 methoxy 1 methylurea Linuron 5 bromo 3 sec butyl 6 methyluracil Bromacil 3 cyclohexyl 5,6 trimethyleneuracil Lenacil 2 chloro l 3 ethoxy 4 nitrophenoxy 4 trifluorornethyl benzene 3 isopropyl lH 2,1,3 benzothiadiazin 4 3H one, 2,2 dioxide Bentazone 1,l dimethyl 4,4 bipyridium ion Paraauat 2,4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid and salts 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl phenoxy 2 nitrobenzOic acid, sodium salts Blazers The oomIx ds of the present invention may also be combined with any other herbicide and they are particularly useful in combination with herbicides of the substituted urea, uracil or s triazine types for controlling a broad spectrum of weeds. Herbicidal activity of the subject compounds was discovered in a number of greenhouse tests, as described below. Test A Seeds of crabgrass Digitaria spp. , barnyardgrass chinochloa cruscalli , wild oats Avena fatua , cassia Cassia tora , morningglory Iportioea hederacea , cocklebur Santhium spp. , sorghum, corn, soybean, rice, wheat and nuts edge tubes were planted in a growth medium and treated preemergence with the chemicals dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent.At the same time, cotton having five leaves including cotyledonary ones , bush beans with the third trifoliate leaf expanding, crabgrass with two leaves, barnyardgrass with two leaves, wild oats with one leaf, cassia with three leaves including cotyledonary ones , morningglory with four leaves including the cotyledonary ones , cocklebur with four leaves including the cotyledonary ones , sorghum with three leaves, corn with three leaves, soybean with two cotyledonary leaves, rice with two leaves, wheat with one leaf, a.id nutsedgewith three five leaves were sprayed. Treated plants and controls were maintained in a greenhouse for sixteen days, then all species were compared to controls and visually rated for response in treatment. Ratings for compounds tested by this procedure are recorded in Table A. The ratings are based on a numerical scale extending from 0 no injury, to 10 complete kill. The accompanying letters have the following meanings C chlorosis necrosis B burn G growth retardation E emergence inhibition H formative effects X axillary stimulation 6Y abscised buds or flowers and 6F delayed flowering.

The layer of soil above the crop seeds was uniformly infested with seeds of the following weed species crabgrass Di itaria spp. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli , giant foxtail Setaria faberii , and johnsongrass Sorghum halepense .Promptly after planting, the test chemical was applied to the surface of the soil, dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent. The treated pots were then exposed to approximately 4 mm of simulated rainfall and transferred to the greenhouse. Twenty eight days after treatment, the estimated percentages of grass weed control were recorded and observations were made on crop response, again.utilizing the rating system as described for test A.The data are shown in table E. It is obvious that the test compound possesses utility for the pre emergence control of grass weeds in soybeans and cotton.

Approximately 2 1 2 weeks after planting, the young plants and te soil around them were sprayed overall with the test chemical dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent.Fifteen days after treatment, all species were compared to untreated controls and visually rated for response to treatment. The rating system was as described previously forTest A. The data are presented in Table F. The compound tested by this procedure is useful for the post emergence control of weeds.

Immediatly after planting, the soil surfaces were treated with a solution in a non phytotoxic solvent of the compound whose structure is shown in Table D. One group of pots served as pre emergence treatments a second group was used to simulate soil incorporated treatements whereby the surface applied chemical was promptly mixed with the top 2.5 cm layer of soil con taining the weed sees. All of the pots were then watered from overhead at te rate of approximately 4 of water in a period of 160 minutes. The treated pots and controls were held in a greenhouse and oh the twenty eight days after treatement were visually rated using the same scale and symbols as described herein before.
