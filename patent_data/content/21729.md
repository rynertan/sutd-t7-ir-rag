# Closure assembly including a tamper indicating device.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a tamper indicating device 18 for a container closure 16 to normally prevent the distortion of the closure as required to remove the closure. The tamper indicating ring 18 includes a continuous band 44 which must be ruptured in order to remove the tamper indicating ring. When the processing of the container assembly 10 requires the introduction of heat, the tamper indicating ring is heated and the band expands and then shrinks. Difficulties encountered with this first expansion and later shrinkage have been solved by forming the band in a plurality of sections 54 connected together by expansion segments 56 .
