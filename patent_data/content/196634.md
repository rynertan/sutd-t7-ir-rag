# NETWORK SYSTEM

## Abstract
A time division multiplex transmission network system having a plurality of data processing stations, in which data of a predetermined number of bits is transmitted on a data transmission line for a period of time determined by the number of bits of data by one bit in synchronization with a synchronization signal extracted from a predetermined time series code string signal when one of code patterns derived from the predetermined time series code string signal coincides with a predetermined code pattern indicating an address allocated to one of the individual data stations.
