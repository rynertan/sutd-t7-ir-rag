# Electric discharge machines.

## Abstract
In a wire or band electrode type electric discharge machine an electric spark is generated between the wire or band electrode 2 and a workpiece 12 to machine that workpiece 12 . The electrode 2 is fed longitudinally of itself to provide a fresh supply thereof. For automatically restoring operation when the electrode 2 breaks, the machine has a clamping mechanism 8 which immediately clamps the broken electrode 2 on the electrode supply side of the workpiece 12 to prevent the electrode 2 falling under its own weight. An electrode feed mechanism 9 is then actuated, first to draw back the broken electrode 2 from the workpiece 12 on the supply side then to guide the end of the broken electrode 12 into a slot or hole 21 machined in the workpiece 12 until the end emerges from the other side of the workpiece 12 . An electrode pull up mechanism 13 grips the emergent end and pulls up the electrode 2 after release by the clamping mechanism 8 .
