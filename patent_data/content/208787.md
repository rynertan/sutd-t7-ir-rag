# MEDICAL GUIDING MICRO TUBE.

## Abstract
A medical guiding micro tube consisting of a tube 1 of a synthetic resin a balloon 4 joined to the front end of the tube 1 and having an outer diameter substantially equal to that thereof, and a small fluid leak bore 14 as necessary and a spherical member 15 provided in the balloon and connected to the front end of the tube by a thread 16 of a limited length. This micro tube is capable of guiding liquid medicine safely to peripheral blood vessels. If this micro tube is used as a leak balloon catheter, the leaking of liquid medicine can be timed accurately, and the timing of the leakage of liquid medicine can be regulated with a high producibility.
