# Guide for electric cable insulation extrusion head.

## Abstract
Apparatus for extruding a first layer of a semiconductive plastic material around the conductor of an electric power cable and for extruding a second layer of plastic insulating material around the first layer as the conductor is advanced in which the extruder for the insulating material includes an extrusion head which comprises a body with a passageway therethrough for the passage of the conductor through the body and having at least one channel therein extending from the exterior thereof to adjacent one end of the passageway for supplying the insulating material around the conductor. An extrusion tip or tubular guide is disposed in the passageway for guiding said conductor and extends across part of the channel for contacting material exiting from the channel. The guide comprises a ceramic tube with a polished inner surface forming the innermost surface of the guide.
